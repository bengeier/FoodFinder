{"text":"The miyagi burger was awesome, the black and green burger had a sweet flavor of deliciousness. Enjoyed some sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries with the burgers.  Definitely returning soon to try more burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The burgers are fresh and inventive. The beer offerings are substantial. The bartenders and wait staff and patient informative and generally up beat."}
{"text":"The food has a wonderful  blending of flavors.  Craig was our server and he was very attentive.  My husband has allergies and the kitchen was very careful on the ingredients in each dish.  It is  more than we normally pay for burgers - but these are gourmet, a real treat.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Drive for a burger - off the strip - Yes!

Burger's amazing! From the NW we're in the land of grass fed, well treated beef, I was amazed by this burger....really, truly, \"....just go\"

Caesar Salad, incredible! The anchovy on top - was plump and shiny and lovely.....Beware the croutons just might be 1000 calories a pop - but so good. \".....just go\"

Truffle French Fries - they did a 1/2 and 1/2 with the Sweet Potato Fries for us - they were perfect

Service - great

Atmosphere - great

But honestly - the 5 stars are for the food - it's so good. I was in Las Vegas for 5 days - went here twice....have I said this yet?.....just go!\""}
{"text":"Food Ordered: Mr Ho's burger, Garlic Parmesan fries, bachi pickles, pineapple ketchup

food:  mr ho's burger was served on a taro bun!  this was very unique and different. there was a slight sweetness to the bun, and a hint of taro to it. very good, I like!  Bachi pickles were kinda interesting... it  was like a mix plate of different types of pickled radishes and cucumber. Fun when they were added to the burger.  Garlic Parm fries were delicious.  the pineapple ketchup was delicious! pineapple sweetness and flavor infused in the ketchup - very tasty

Service: our waitress was very informative and patient, as it was our first time visiting Bachi burger.  Gave us some great suggestions. 

Parking: plenty of parking spaces in a small strip mall.  

misc:  came here early on a Saturday morning ~11:30am and didn't have problems getting a table.  When we left at about 12:30pm, there were lots of people waiting outside for a table.  Bachi Burger and shoku? ramen are right next door to each other, they share the same entrance door, and you can order both burger and ramen at the same time."}
{"text":"On the way out of Las Vegas we stopped by, since we were referred by other family members.  The wait was about 35 minutes, but we did have a party of 11.  I had the Green and Black burger made with Wagyu beef and some truffle fries.........absolutely amazing.  Price was about $14 for the burger and $4 for the fries, well worth it.  I highly recommend this place to anyone that thinks they have had a good burger before."}
{"text":"First of all, it's behind Subway....we had a little difficulty finding it and circled the parking lot before finding it.

Service:  Slow like many reviews said, however, we weren't upset at all.  I didn't read the reviews before going here because I was thinking with 200 reviews & 4 stars and all our friends recommending it, it's worth a try.  So I didn't know about the slow service.  I just commented during dinner how we had finished all our appetizers and our burgers have yet to arrive.  The reason why I think none of us were upset was because the staff did seem very nice and were just new or something.  Oh and my boyfriend also commented that I should not have ordered my appetizers when the waiter came to ask for our drink orders because he seemed really flustered that I interrupted his order of doing things.  Also the appetizers came out way before the water did, which I thought was strange.

Food:

Sweet potato fries were really good.  I loved the yuzu citrus aioli that came with it.

Truffle parmesean fries was pretty good too.  It came with a sun dried tomato aioli, which I thought wasn't as good as the sweet potato one.  I think it really depends on personal taste, because half of us liked the sweet potato one more and the other half the truffle one more.

Garlic, ginger, and chili edamame was really good.  I love the flavor and it's so much better than plain salted edamame that I am used to at Japanese restuarants.

Oxtail chili cheese fries was ok.  I wasn't a big fan of it.  I think I would have preferred beef over oxtail.  I really couldn't tell the difference except for the occasional fattier pieces of meat.  I also would rather it came in a smaller portion because it was a meal in itself.

As for the burgers, we got Kiki's burger, Banh-mi burger, and 2 BBQ Angus burgers with some add-ons.  No one in my party enjoyed their burgers that much.  I was ok with mine, but it wasn't that good.  I think the main problem (completely our fault) is that we didn't realized it was BBQ, meaning sweet BBQ sauce.  No one like that the patties had a sweet taste and was competing with the other sauces.  My brother took probably 3 bites and bagged it home for his dog, saying that he would prefer In-N-Out...and all the other great burger places in Philly.  He thought that even though he ordered medium, it came out too dry for him.  His girlfriend had the Banh-mi, with the BBQ and curry aioli, I don't think she even touched the fish sauce.  She didn't finish her burger either.  My boyfriend thought his burger was ok but the bottom bun was soggy, probably because his egg was running down the side when it was delivered to the table.  My burger was ok too.  it didn't wow me though.  My boyfriend and I were the only ones who finished our burgers.

Also their boba drinks are not made from fresh fruits.  I was hoping they were, but good thing I asked before I ordered one.  I did try the green milk tea boba and it was ok.

I don't think I will come back here again.  If I do, it will only be to do take out for the sweet potato fries and edamame."}
{"text":"The fusion idea of western burger with asian flair equals superb quality and delightful masterpiece on everyones palate. What i love about this place is the relaxed and cozy atmosphere, the aroma of the burgers that is truly engaging and inviting whether you are a \"meatatarian\" or vegetarian, there is a burger that would suit you. Their burgers were really cooked to juicy perfection combined with truffles fries and pineapple ketchup on the side, what is there to ask for... Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great service, AMAZING food, totally worth the 35min. wait for a table. 

Had the Parmesan truffle fries while we waiting for our burgers, they were fantastic. Perfectly and evenly good and excellently complimented by the condiments. Must try. 

Had the Ronin burger; it was superb. Perfect combination of sweet and savory. Full of flavor without being too rich to finish. The bun was fresh and nicely toasted, the patty was charred and delicious while still juicy and cooked to my specification, toppings were on point. Literally nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by Bachi Burger to experience everything people have raved to me about. Everything started out great - assorted pickles, oxtail chili cheese fries with a fried egg on top, truffle Parmesan sweet potato fries with pineapple ketchup. Our server seemed to be having a rough day as she messed up our order several times and forgot to bring a coffee we ordered after asking about it on 4 separate occasions. I decided to go with the Shogun Burger ($26) which is Bachi's premium burger: wagyu beef prepared medium, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and arugala. Something didn't taste right from the beginning but our server never even came by to ask how everything was and seemed way too busy to even want to bother her despite the fact we were sitting at the bar right in front of her. About halfway through the burger I deconstructed it to find out what was wrong and I realized the beef was the issue: over cooked, dry and completely flavorless. I spoke to the manager who came to the table in a very unpleasant manner and said she would take care of it. Upon returning she informed us that she had kindly removed 10% from the entire bill which sounded great but turned out to be $7 - $7 off of a $26 dry and flavorless burger. I told her it would not suffice and she informed me that since I had eaten half of the burger, that 10% is all she could do. She offered to make a new burger for FULL PRICE and I told her that is completely inappropriate. After she went back and showed my burger to the chef who was arguing with her in plain sight which allowed me to see and hear everything he was saying, he told her to comp the burger in disgust. She brought the bill back, threw it down in front of us and walked away without saying a word. I'm not saying this is a typical day at Bachi Burger but it was absolutely disgusting behavior. The burger was just bad. The meat was flavorless and the patty was about as thick as a Burger King Whopper patty - definitely not $26 restaurant quality, especially since the other burger that was ordered was a thick and juicy correctly prepared and very flavorful patty. To top it all off, the bathroom was a complete mess with what looked like food or possibly some human excrement ground into the floor: I nearly vomited at the sight. Despite all of this, I would not expect to have the same experience again and would give the place another shot and I would recommend it to others because there are so many options on the menu.

In the end, they handled the bill correctly and comped the burger but they are completely ill prepared for handling these situations. Our server seemed so overwhelmed and busy that she was completely inattentive but was very kind and compassionate and apologized repeatedly for the quality of the food. A patron shouldn't have to argue their case for a $26 Burger - you're a restaurant, own up to your mistake and take care of it. A happy restaurant brings happy patrons who spend more and write great reviews."}
{"text":"Worst service I've EVER had in my life! Server did not care about service at all. No server to begin with. Had to flag someone down and he was upset that we did that. No one checked on us through out the meal and when it was time to pay they held my card for 15 min. Worst service of my life."}
{"text":"Apps were great. We had cox oxtail fries and duck bun sliders. All high quality and good flavor.  Burger was darn good as well.  Not the best ive had, but enjoyable.  Service was very good too. I would have given 4 stars but the flies were ridiculous.  We sat inside and kept swatting flies. It really took away from the experience. It also makes you question the cleanliness of the operation. This is Vegas and indoors, flies should never be this bad."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch, just to check out the hype of this location but it was a huge disappointment.

Ordered the Miyagi and kiki burger with truffle fries.  

Truffle fries were a big let down, a bit soft and the aroma was not there.  The ones at Noras was way better, it was the type of fries that you didn't want to stop eating.

The Miyagi burger suppose to be wagyu Kobe beef, cooked medium rare, but the tempura battered onion rings were luke warm to cold, and with a burger that is the last thing I was expecting.  Drenched in sauces which was not necessary.  Took a bite of just the beef patty alone, flavorless... It didn't have the sweetness in wagyu beef that melts in your mouth.  

The Kiki burger Kobe beef, medium rare, too much sauce, flavorless beef...  

At the end I talked to the manager about some of the issues because the server did not believe my comments, realized I was correct and,manager apologized... Good save by the manager... Overall drenching a burger in Japanese sauces doesn't constitute Japanese style burgers when the most important beef is not promoted as the main flavor of the burger..."}
{"text":"The ox tail fries and burgers are very good, love the taste.  Had a little trouble finding the place because it was not on the main road, it next to a movie theater.  Very worth the trip."}
{"text":"2nd time here.  Came here for lunch 9/5/17 right after our flight from the Bay Area.  Great service. Wagu patty was juicy and tasty.   Sweet potato fries!!!  Kale salad was pretty standard."}
{"text":"Just came in again tonight omg.  It was to die for!  Nothing short of amazing you must try this place!  Love the sake! Miso  Burger is my favorite.  Coupled with the truffle fries I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out cause my brother  said it was pretty good. The services horrible I ordered one of their specialty drinks and it was too sweet so I asked if I could just change it to coke and they said they couldn't do that because we drank out of it already. The oxtail fries were just okay. I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had!!!!!!!!
Neat place where the locals go for great burgers.  The truffle fries are the bomb."}
{"text":"My colleagues took me here for dinner last night.  I did not expect their  burgers to be so good.  The prices are a little high, but there are a variety of gourmet burgers to choose from.  The fries with chili are good too.  I am not a big fan of beef, but I would not mind going back when I am back in Vegas for work.  By the way, the service was excellent as well.  I gave them a 4 star because the price was a little high for a hamburger, but they are worth a try."}
{"text":"Seems like we were at Bachi Burger around the same time as Dave.  We were told the wait time would be about 25 minutes, but was actually closer to15. The atmosphere was comfortable, the numerous servers were pleasant and attentive.  Our food was delicious, it arrived promptly, and hot.
Three new \"fans\" from SB"}
{"text":"Wow the reviews were on point! This place really hits the spot! I am not normally a burger person but I was craving one and I have only heard good things about this place so I decided to try it out and I might even go back tomorrow lol really really good!!! Fresh juicy and cooked to perfection! Make sure you get avocado on top! Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Service and food was off the chain!! A  MUST HAVE IS THE FISH BURGER....& THE LAVA CHOCOLATE CAKE...I'll take a picture of it before it's all gone lol. Love this place even with the long wait

I had the Emily (the waitress, loveedd her earrings, and she was really courteous, informational & just a complete pleasure) & Ryoji (who periodically filled for water, who btw is complete eye candy)"}
{"text":"We went here on a pretty slow weekday night. The food was amazing. They had a ramen menu as well. Between that and the regular menu the variety of options offered here is perfect. 

We ordered the tonkatsu ramen, the flavor was very good, noodles weren't over cooked. We also had a custom burger, the duck buns, French fr"}
{"text":"It seems like I end up here every time I'm in Vegas.  The burgers are great! ... Different from what I'm used to with the Asian flare, but excellent!!! Wasn't quite sure how I was going to like having kimchi on my burger, but my brother said it was delicious, so, I tried it.  And, for the first time in his life, he was right! Had another burger with an egg and something else on it, and it was fantastic too!

I really like plain old burgers and cheeseburgers like 5 Guys and In N Out, etc., but for a really excellent gourmet burger treat, this place is super!!! Will be back...repeatedly."}
{"text":"Awesome. After seeing this on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives I had to visit. 
It was quite crowded on the evening we went but we were promptly seated at the bar. The server explained everything and made his recommendations. The Green and Blue burger was the best burger ever (grass fed beef with blue cheese). The buns are freshly baked and don't compare to anything I've ever eaten before. 
There are some exotic foods but also the basic burger and fries made to your liking. The staff is friendly. I would eat there again and again!"}
{"text":"Let's see, food was great, the truffle fries were amazing and the originality of flavor they presented here was a successful strength.  This place is so unique.  You won't find a place quite like it anywhere else; I can't emphasize enough that I'm impressed with the originality of Bachi Burger, it shines from concept to execution.  The service was also superb; the food came out in a timely manner and the servers filled my drink just after taking a couple sips.  Why give this place 4 stars?  The air was cranked up a bit high, and the whole time I was eating, a ceiling light was blinding my right eye.  Some more attention to atmosphere and this place easily deserves a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries was very good but the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and Ronin burger were not.  Both burgers were relatively tasteless and whatever taste was there was interesting.

It is definitely not worth a taxi ride from the strip."}
{"text":"So, the restaurant sent me a letter after my Yelp post to tell me that they were working on the service speed.  Well, they did!  Based on some other reviews I tried the crab cakes.  Wow!  I had a burger again, which was awesome, but was jealous of the fish sandwich ordered by people at the table next to me.  Well, that just means that I'll be back.  Again, service was much-improved so they get five stars this time because the service was excellent and the crab cake was the true five star surprise.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Lonely Bird Burger were excellent! Highly recommend!

Very nice atmosphere- clean and modern.  Tucked away in a shopping center- great food. Go here if you are in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Bachi Burger you have made my day! I waited all day to finally try this place out since everyone reviews made it seem like I'm missing out. So all I can say to my fellow yelpers \"Thank you\" this place is yummy in my tummy. 
When my family and I walked in a young gentlemen greeted us and sat us down. I asked him about the burgers and which one is the most popular one. Kalbi burger and Kiki burger is what he suggested. My bf ordered the Kiki burger and I ordered the Ronin burger since it looked delicious from the pictures everyone posted. We ordered the side of fries, the truffle Parmesan and the garlic salt and pepper fries. And the perfect way to end our meal is dessert, the donuts were mouthwatering. 
Overall my experience was top-notch!"}
{"text":"I love me some Bachi Burger! When I found out that the Sahara and Ft Apache location opened I was very excited because now I don't have to drive all the way across town to eat there. 

I ordered the Pork Belly steamed buns and a side of the salt and pepper fries. I love their fries it was perfectly seasoned and had a kick to it because of the jalapenos. The pork belly steamed buns was okay the cilantro kind of over powered the flavor. My daughter ordered the kids Bachi burger which came with regular fries, carrots, and apple slices. She loved the burger! 

Overall, the service was great, the food is amazing, and I will definitely be coming back again to this location!"}
{"text":"Truffle fries are a must try. The pork belly buns were very tasty. The kalbi burger was a little rare in the middle even though we ordered medium rare but rare beef doesn't scare me. The red velvet ice cream shake was great. The southern sweet tea was bad and for some reason pineapple and mint was in it...?  The music was upbeat and made a nice ambiance. There were plenty of servers and we will go back for another dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Came with a large party and had no issues. Server was polite and accommodating to everyone. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries as appetizers. Tried several different burgers and there was not a single disappointed person in our group. Great mix of flavors! Great quality! Cannot wait to go again and try more of the menu. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"These burgers are so delicious.  I love the oxtail fries, too.  I've been here a few times and the service is very friendly.  I would give this five stars but I think it is a bit overpriced.  The burgers are a la carte and start at around $10.  Add fries and you pay another $3 or $4.  Still, this is a great restaurant for a date night before or after seeing a movie."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but service wasn't. The hostess looked like she hated her job. We were not greeted or even given a smile. She barely even made eye contact. As for the food:

- Kalbi Burger- 5 stars. I got it without the kimchi and it was amazing!!
- Banh Mi Burger- 4 stars. It was pretty good, but the combination between hamburger and Banh Mi was a little too weird for me. 
- Truffle Fries- 3 stars. Nothing special.
- Duck in steamed bun (forgot what it was called) 1 star. Tasted like all of the nasty parts of the duck were used. I could barely bite a piece off. It was chewy and bland.

Back to the service, it was a really long wait for our food to come out. There were a bunch of empty tables, yet the the wait to be seated was about 30 minutes. It looked like there was only one waitress on our half of the restaurant. For a weekend, they should've been more prepared."}
{"text":"Went here with big expectations but was pretty disappointed:/ 3 stars for freshness of ingredients and interesting flavors. Burgers didn't even come with fries, womp!"}
{"text":"This was my third trip here and it was a bit of a let down after the last two. I met my girlfriend here at 6pm on Sunday night and the place was fairly empty so we were seated quickly. The waitstaff was on top of their game and even as the place filled up the waiters managed to make sure our glasses were full and we had what we needed. As with other trips we ordered the oxtail fries which are one of my favorite things on the planet. This time they were a bit underwhelming but still good. We also ordered the duck steamed buns which were cold when they arrived but still good, particularly the dipping sauce. We split a Kiki burger which was very good but not nearly as good as blue and green. Maybe we were there on an off night but the food was just mediocre and when you are paying $60 for two appetizers, one burger and two domestic beers you expect excellence."}
{"text":"The service here felt like I was eating dinners at a strangers house. Was not a pleasant experience and very weird energy. From the hostess to the waitress they were very unprofessional and unfriendly. Especially VID. Loud and constantly giggling and talking about the customers. Our waitress was OK but that was towards the end."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was ok. Took a long time to get the check. Probably waited longer for the check than the food. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! Had heard positive things about the place and once arrived was treated disrespectfully by management. Hostess had an attitude, when spoke with customers she acted unprofessionally. Servers when taking orders were not patient. Bachi your staff are bad for business and definitely need to be trained about customer service excellence - they were far below subpar. I run a large organization and at least 3 people in the place would've been written up or terminated if they worked for me!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the most OVER-RATED restaurant in the Las Vegas valley. Burgers are completely average. Flavor: 3/5, but Quality: 2/5 and Price 0/5. (I love Burgers will give you far more bang for your buck. And you won't have to wait an hour or get crap service.) TRUFFLE FRIES!?!?!? Embarrassing. Anyone who's actually tasted truffle oil will be tragically disappointed. Shoku Ramenya: taste like it's from a foodcart. Again, this would be ok if you also got foodcart service and price. Don't waste your time or money, there are so many truly great spots around town to try instead."}
{"text":"Went this past Monday night. Food was totally awesome and our server was awesome as well. Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for quite some time now after seeing it featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.  The star of the show was the oxtail chili cheese fries.  Which on the show, looked amazing.  The chili cheese fries were made with copious amounts of oxtail and was a meal in itself.   I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual,  after Guy leaves,  things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse, the price had been increased to $11.  That's the same price as a burger!"}
{"text":"Burnt food, Horrible service !
We used to love this place so much that after doing 6 weeks Raw Fitness diet program, this was the first place we ate. Utterly disappointed!
Firstly, we ordered 2 Miyagi burgers & both came out BURNT! Yes, literally burnt whereas we requested it medium rare.
I took an effort to inform the server that the food is burnt.. she barely stopped for few seconds to listen to me & her reply was \"sorry, we are busy today so the food could be bit off\"..... BIT OFF??... It was 'burnt' for God sake... she just brushed it off as if I am making a big deal of it. 
Cmon! I am a foodie.. I Love my food so if it's burnt, it does bother me.... especially if i am spending $16 on a damn burger. 
Just think, Gordon Ramsey's Burgr bar at PH has an awesome Hell's Kitchen burger at $14 with exceptional service & ideal location.
Why should I ever spend more to eat a Burnt burger with horrible service & who-cares attitude of the server?
I will be reporting this incident to their manager tomorrow. Let's see if he can do something to get my confidence back in this place.

Btw, I am not even highlighting other service issue like no one filling my water glass for 20 minutes until I waved my hand 5 times...server talking to me while walking & not even caring to stop to listen to me...inspite of their App saying 10% off on the bill if you download the app, the server refused to honor it even when I clearly showed it to her.."}
{"text":"Had the best burger of my life here, it was GREAT.  I went in a party of four and we had 2 Kiki's burgers, one Bahn Mi and one Ho burger.  Everyone raved.  The burgers are so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  The service was very good as well.  This is my favorite LV casual restaurant."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about Bachi burger yet never made the time to actually try it out. The reviews on here are mostly positive from what I've seen, with the majority of the problems coming from complaints over service/having to wait (which I think is a ridiculous thing to complain about in the first place). Customer service is a big deal to me, but since everyone says the food is on another level, I finally decided to give it a chance.
And OH BOY am I glad I did!

I came in around 5pm and I could tell it was pretty busy at first glance. I was almost instantly greeted by a friendly young woman, despite the rush. I believe she said her name was Bianca. I was almost taken aback since it seemed pretty hectic and she was still so polite and charming. After reading the reviews on here I was expecting much worse right from the start! I can't stress enough how impressed I was though, she seemed to be doing more than one job yet still made it a point to update me on how long I'd be waiting (about 20~30). Left a great first impression and actually ended up waiting shorter than expected even! 

I took a seat at the bar with a buddy of mine and I have to point out how they had the menus organized. Everything was easy to find and having the ingredients all on there for each item is a simple, convenient idea. Aubrey was also very helpful in explaining the menu, the variety of drink choices, and just how everything worked there in general. She really knew her stuff! 
Everything looked tempting to try honestly, but I was feeling more of a ramen mood than burgers. I'm a huge fan of ramen and I'm constantly trying to find the best of what Vegas has to offer.

And if you're a fan of ramen like i am, Shoku ramen is definitely a MUST. Oh man, it blew me away. I kept it simple with an order of the spicy tonkotsu and was considering ordering extra ingredients, but I was assured the serving size would be more than accommodating.
(And I'm so grateful for that advice)
The bowls were a little larger than what I usually expect and I was very happy about that! Especially considering how delicious it was. The broth fused perfectly with all the ingredients and that tontoro is seriously out of this world. I even had to order extra of it because it was so good, literally melts in your mouth. I got a lychee soda paired with that which was super tasty, a little too sweet for me to finish though. I also tried a 21+ caramel milkshake which was pretty interesting. Maybe a little \"too spiked\" but really nothing worth complaining about because it was still great. 

The staff all seemed really nice and while I noticed some of them did appear to be \"goofing off\" with each other, it really didn't halt or even delay any service. I can appreciate a restaurant with friendly people working there, and it's always nice to see staff get along. With the service getting so much gripe on yelp I was expecting the worst, but then again I'm not a stickler for little things. I know how it is to work in a fast-paced environment and a busy restaurant. I know how it can get so maybe that's why I'm a little more sympathetic toward it, but as long as everyone is handling their work and getting stuff done in the restaurant, it's no reason to give anything less than 4 stars. A lot of the complaints I've read on here are now starting to sound more trivial, appearing to be people upset over things not being catered specifically for them. Just cut the workers some slack, and try to realize they're working hard to get things done for everyone in the restaurant.

Besides that though, I definitely plan on returning soon to try one of their famous burgers! I noticed that some of them were pretty huge, but if it's too big for you to handle you can easily cut it into smaller portions. If you're someone who doesn't sweat the small stuff, and don't mind waiting then I definitely recommend giving this Bachi a try. If you're in it for some delicious food and a friendly atmosphere then this is the place to go! 
Don't let the negative reviews steer you away, it's definitely worth your time to try it out at least once! Your taste buds will thank you :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place and order the same thing over and over. I get the Spicy Miso burger every time. I visit this place so frequently, they know my name and order as soon as I walk in. The Spicy Miso burger is the best burger I've tasted in my life."}
{"text":"Had heard this place was good and stumbled in for an impromptu early lunch this windy Saturday morning. Just the smell coming from the kitchen was enough to entice us! These were probably the best burgers we had other than homemade in a very long time. The combination of spices, sweet fish sauce, mushrooms, on the Kiki burger were perfect.  I loved the sweet, zesty flavor. We shared the two burgers and the other was the Black and Green burger. This burger had a total earthy, warm delicious flavor. What The buns were steamed and grilled to perfection. The burgers were a good size but not so overwhelmed with toppings that they were messy or difficult to eat. I would highly recommend this stop and according to the table next to us the Portuguese doughnuts were delicious for dessert!"}
{"text":"Bravo! A place that takes pride in what they serve you... well, my food was fantastic!!! I had the Oxtail Chile Fries: Delicious!!! oh, and huge... make sure there is at least 2 or 3 sharing this...Pricey: $11, but worth it...  Also had the Banh Min Burger, not sure about the spelling, but it was out of this world... expensive, $10 for a burger, but oohhh sooo good, it was tasty, I love cilantro, there was all kind of spice in there, not hot spicy, by tasty spice, I loved their side fish sauce, where you get to dip your burger in, well, I did, it was even better, was it Nuoc man sauce?... well, it was a great mix of taste, and my taste buds went crazy!!! So, A+ on this restaurant. Server was funny, nice, paid attention, did a great job. The manager or ?... came and checked on our table a few times to make sure we were ok, answered a few questions we had for him... oh, the beer: Dead Man Ale.... Delicious!!! Dessert: Pop Tart!!! wow!!! Onolicious people!!! homemade and .... soooo good! 
Well, to sum up, I will be back ..."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! We could literally eat here everyday! The service has been great, as well. We have tried a few different items and all have been mouth watering. My favorite is the miyagi san burger! Fries and sauce are great too. Drinks are great. Food is high quality, restaurant is clean, bathrooms are clean, air conditioned, nice ambiance, fair prices. Everything is awesome here. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally Bachi is right around the corner from where I live! It's the same great food and service as the original on Windmill plus some smoothies and fresh juices. Awesome burgers!! Hope they do well at the new location."}
{"text":"This had become a tradition for my group that I go to Vegas with! We drink, gamble, and when were down to our last $20-30 then we go here! When you come here you forget all the money you've lost and end the trip on a happy note! I personally love onions and egg on my burger and so I recommend getting the Miyagi Burger! It goes for about $13.50. Then add some fries and a coke and the total should come out to around 20 usually. The first time I had the oxtail chili cheese fries and found a hair in it, but they were so nice they gave us a whole new chilli cheese fries and all the drinks were free (about a group of 10-12 of us). The meat they use and bread is just different. It is like the first meal they give you once you get to Heaven. lol I might be over exaggerating, but its definitely my favorite burger (better than Umami, DogHaus, In-n-out, etc).

Recommendations
Dont come into the place thinking of all the hype you hear and just judge it for being such great quality. A bit pricey, but not some where you go to eat everyday either. Be ready to spend at least 20 if you want a meal."}
{"text":"First off let me say that they have a remarkable parking lot, which is where we waited for about 40 mins to get seated, the anticipation I had was that of waiting for a ride at Disneyland, I was mildly disappointed. By the way it looks like a starbu&* convention in the parking lot with the fancy cars and the few overdressed people looking to flex their culinary lack of taste or perhaps they are just herd follower's I don't know, didn't ask either way there is a slightly pretentious feeling in the air there.
  
Ok, on to the table and food, let it be known that their service is EXCELLENT!, their server's are great, even if the flamboyant gentleman did forget my saracha hot sauce lol. They were quick almost instantaneous with the pre dinner drinks, which came out almost as if they had somebody behind the corner who already knew what we wanted, appetizers took about 10 mins, and they would have been worth a 20 minute wait, all of our guests reported they loved the appetizers, in fact one said he would just forget the burger and order the chicken appies and the fries for pick-up and head home, they were that good. NO compaints there at all. * I cant express how great our waiter was, and their staff even tho he did forget my hot sauce request*  They give SUPERIOR customer service.
 
  About 15 mins or so after the appies came out our main course ala burgers arrived, in all their pretentious arrogant glory lol, with their glossy buns and spike stabbed thru the middle, initially I thought \"so this is what those perfectly presented and prepared commercial burgers look like in real life\", they looked like Hollywood props, very shiny, looking it over I had to chuckle lol, I ordered it well and it was cooked perfectly once again, if anything they are consistent here, the burger was too sweet for my tastes, it didn't deliver the punch to the palate that I was expecting but it was very OK, nothing stood out at me or there was nothing singular ingredient wise I could say I liked about this particular burger, you know eh, it was ok, it looks way better than it tastes. I cant honestly give a superb recommendation for this place because it just wasn't worth the price, its a 6 dollar burger at best with a 15 dollar presentation. Yes it does look great, but for all that flash it needs more bite. I've had better at local pubs for way less. The truffle fries were on a 1-10 scale a solid 8, very tasty as was their chili fries. 
   
Maybe its the hipster crowd herd following thing that makes this place appear better than it really is, or I guess people just have mediocre taste buds but Bachi burger didn't do it for me, cant say that I will return unless its for appetizers to go....
 Get out there and eat Vegas , explore and report =) be well."}
{"text":"Loved the Kalbi burger! I would pass on the Chili Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"First time with the Summerlin location, but not with Bachi Burger. I brought my famished friends from L.A. here after they made the drive to visit me. Naturally, I had to give them a tour from the local's POV, starting off with getting them fed properly.

I can't speak on behalf of my friends, but the fact that they were finished every bite speaks for itself. Or... they could've just been hungry, but they seemed quite satisfied so I'll leave it at that.

Had the kalbi burger and I gotta say that it hit my burger craving right on the head. Though it only made a small dent in my Korean food craving, the burger itself was cooked medium and was moist and tender as it should be. The kimchi wasn't too overpowering and blended well with the gochujang mayo.

Between the five of us, we split an order of truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries. Personally, I like the sweet potato fries more, but I'm working on discerning the truffle flavor. The aiolis are matched well with their respective fries.

Service was great and pricing is typical for an upscale burger restaurant like this."}
{"text":"I heard great things about the Bachi Fish Burger. So since this was my first visit here I ordered the Bachi Fish Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  I was NOT disappointed.  The burger was huge! The bun tasted like it was freshly made, soft and moist. The fish was cooked perfectly, nice and flaky, moist and mild tasting.  The fries were served with a citrus dipping sauce which was an excellent combination.  

The service was great!"}
{"text":"If you want a good, interesting burger in Las Vegas... this is the place.  Good, crispy fries (including sweet potato and oxtail chili!)  The burgers are nuts-- the Bahn Mi and Kalbi burgers are my favorites.  Haven't tried the \"wagyu and foie gras\" burger yet.

OK, here comes the maybe-not-so-good stuff.  It's kind of a strip mall feeling.  Because it's in a strip mall.  And... the meat isn't the best burger meat I've ever had.  Kind of tastes frozen... or just CAFO-beefy.  Not bad, but not particularly beefy. They definitely focus on dressing up the average burger meat well.  

But, they do that.  The burgers are great, and the beer selection's particularly good for Las Vegas, where most places seem hell-bent on serving Lite Beer or Blue Moon and that's all.

Worth a drive and a bit of a search to find if you're anywhere near there."}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here for a long time but heard the wait was very long. Finally went there with some friends on a weekday after 8pm thinking crowd would be gone but I was totally wrong. Still long wait for table seating so we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and made great drinks (one of the best Cosmos my wife has ever had-yes from sex and the city). I had the Ronin burger and truffle fries and it was worth the wait....juicy burger, caramelized onions and a fried egg!"}
{"text":"Simply put...

The food is amazing... I love the miyagi son burger and the pork belly steam buns... Everything here is amazing and is different than any other burger place i have tried... Definitely a must visit to anyone coming to Las Vegas...

My only concern is the service, if it wasn't for the amazing food i would never come to this place. The wait staff really seem to not be helpful although the managers seem to be making the rounds checking on the guests...  Such a shame that this place cant be perfect because of the wait staff...

If you wanna try something new and very different but dont want to risk not liking it, go to Bachi Burger..."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger could very well be the best burger I have ever experienced.  With so many choices it is hard to compare, at the end of the day this place has everything. I took an employee of mine to lunch while working in Las Vegas to the highly reviewed Bachi Burger. We started with the Ox Tail fries, which months later are still very memorable. Then moved on to our burger choices, I got the Miyagi, it was a difficult choice as so many burgers looked delicious. Each and every bite was better than the last, I highly recommend. Not much on atmosphere, passable but they make up for it with their food. Make note I have only been to the Windmill location. We both agreed, best burger ever. 

It has been a few months since I have eaten there, but have sent numerous people never does Bachi disappoint."}
{"text":"PROS: The service was great and the place was very clean and inviting.  Ordered the oxtail chili fries and kimchi burger.  The portion of the oxtail fries was great, they give you a lot, so you'll definitely be full afterwards.  The kimchi burger also had great sauce and the buns they used tasted great.

CONS: First off, I was turned off by the fact that the oxtail chili fries had barely any oxtail meat in it (but had lots of fries).  For around $13, you'd expect a little more.  If they're trying to save money, they'd might as well use a cheaper cut of meat and give the customer more bang for their buck.  Second, the burger didn't come with fries.  Again, for around $10, you'd expect a little more.  I know this place is supposed to be \"gourmet,\" but I can easily buy a burger of equal quality at Cheesecake Factory and get fries and complementary bread.  Last, the burger was a little on the burnt side.  I don't know if this was the chef's intention or not, but the surface was charred, not carmelized.  The meat was cooked perfectly, but the outside just tasted a bit off.  Maybe I just came at the wrong time. 

All in all, I was a bit disappointed in this place. I've been looking forward to coming here for ages.  But I'm not giving up yet, and hopefully the next time I come around it'll be better."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at the 30 min wait around 10 pm and wasn't looking to stay. Fortunately the friendly staff and the friend I went with convinced me to grab a cider from the bar. The service was outstanding!! We got our drinks, were seated, and had our appetizer in 30 minutes from arrival (includes the wait time at the bar). The oxtail chili cheese fries were amazing!! Bachi burger's Asian flair on a classic burger is a huge hit! I highly recommend the black and blue burger. Check this place out, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Awesome service! My burger was amazing!!  Tried the oxtail chili fries omg it's a MUST have"}
{"text":"Out of all the gourmet burger places I have tried, this is the best burger place hands down!!!  Everything was just soo flavorful!

Edamame Stir fried with Garlic, Ginger, and Chili:: overall pretty good but I prefer without the ginger (I'm not a ginger person)

Truffle Parmesan Fries:: delish and it smelled sooo good

Pork Belly Steamed Buns:: OH EM GEE!  it was so soft and juicy and it just melted away in my mouth.  I normally don't like to eat fat but this was soo orgasmic.

Ronin Burger:: loved it!  So much flavor, it was party in my mouth!

Kiki's Burger:: only took a few bites and it was good but I prefer the Ronin burger

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries::  pretty damn good.  Surprisingly the chili was good.  Huge portions!  

Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Vegas.  They need to open one up in Socal!"}
{"text":"I ate there Thursday evening 6/12/14 the service was very slow and they had some weird techno music playing. The food was ok but not worth the price you had to pay. They screwed up my order and I had to wait a extra long time for my order while the other people in my party were half way finished with there's. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Checked to see if anything has changed. Nope. Restaurant half empty and told there was over a half an hour wait for a party of 2. How they stay in business is mind boggling. Can't believe the manager is still employed."}
{"text":"Why were we at Bachi... we love the layering of flavors in the burgers. That is why we come to Bachi a few times in the past before this visit tonight. 

I give it a 4 star experince because of the customer service. Also, menus are in need of repair... they were peeling off at the corners and bubbling up in the centers. Furniture is in need of repair too... tables had scuff marks and the bench along the wall near the back corner of restaurant had a broken board under the seats. 

I noticed these things because of the long period of thime we were waiting for our server to start taking our orders for drinks. Once she was there to take our prders we had the best service from her. From checking on us to refilling drinks. She made it awesome."}
{"text":"It was OK.  Different selections as far as burgers go, for sure. They were pretty tasty but I've had better.  Pricey."}
{"text":"Great ingredients, innovative dishes and amazing flavors. This place is great.  The burgers are legendary, the oxtail fries should be mandatory. It's simply delicious."}
{"text":"I'ma BIG Burger fan, just plain 'ol traditional Lettuce Tomato & Oinion kind of gal. I'm also a why fix it of it's not broke kind of Gal,  but I stepped out of my \"burger box\" AND GLAD I DID!!!! EVERY burger here is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers you can get is any of their Wagyu burgers.  It's more casual, so unfortunately they don't take reservations, so if you drive out from the strip with gourmet burgers on the brain, you'll likely have a wait in front of you...we were told 25-30 min for a table for two.  It didn't appear to be packed and there we definitely open seating at the bar, so the wait did seem a bit extended.  Fortunately they did set us up sooner than the 25 min (more like 15).  I ordered the Kiki's burger and the wife had the Miyagi-San burger.  We also ordered the garlic Parmesan fries with a side of spicy aoli.  The burgers were delicious and the patties cooked perfectly medium as requested.  It was a bit weird that the fries did not come at the same time as the burgers.  We were 1/2 way through and just before I was going to flag a server for them, the fries arrived.  They were still good, but I've a feeling someone dropped the ball a bit when the burgers were ready. Otherwise, the service was good and the staff very friendly.  I had a Rogue Draft black lager that complemented the Kiki burger nicely.  We both shared the malasada dessert, which came out nice and hot, but no where near the nice fluffy authentic ones you can get on the islands at Leonard's."}
{"text":"I've only been to Bachi Burger once before on the south side of town. Really loved it then... This time it was still fairly good, I guess this branch just opened up, so it's very new and clean. 

I usually get the Kalbi Burger, although for some reason, this one didn't taste as great as the one I had in the south. I had a bite of my mom's Black and Green Burger, which is her favorite, and it also tasted good. I like their variety of fries. So far I've only tasted their Sweet Potato Fries and Salt and Pepper Fries; both very delicious, especially the dipping sauce that comes with.

My only complaint is that this branch was freezing when me and my mom went in. We kept debating whether or not we should just take the food to go, since it was almost unbearable waiting for our food to come out. It was a windy day, so I wasn't expecting the AC to be on that high. 

Anyways, service was great. We had two servers; both were very friendly. 

My only other advice is come here on an empty stomach, because I had eaten a little while before coming in, so I got full pretty fast. 

I definitely plan to come here again. It's much better than driving all the way to the south for Bachi Burger, especially if you're from North LV, like myself. Just bring a light coat, perhaps? ;)"}
{"text":"Looooove Bachi Burger!  I don't get to go there nearly as often as I would like, but their burgers are bomb!  I especially love the Ronin burger, doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"My first time today for a late lunch. Had a Ronin, and the wife had a Kiki. I must say, they are all about the flavors here. Layer upon layer of deliciousness. Service was great; but this is no fast food burger joint, and it was well worth the 10 or 12 minutes. Parmesan-truffle fries were a fine accompaniment, cooked the size and crispness I liked, and the drizzle of sauce was just the right amount.
There was a little extra aioli for each item. and while I like them all, both the burgers and the fries were awesomely self sufficient.
I'll be back with my wife (I'll drop the kids at McD's) again, and often. I think trying every menu item before the end of the year is a laudable goal.
Thanks for being so close to my house, Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"i was  at this location this afternoon.the restaurant is super clean and charming,all i can say is wooooooow!the food was soo amazing even better than gordon ramsey! at  the planet hollywood,no competition! you would be crazy not to order the kikis burger and pork belly buns!!!

ahhhmazing food,TOO BAD I CANT SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE SERVICE!this guy was super rude and not friendly at all,seems like the restaurant was under staff and clearly this guy didnt  like his job, awful service, i would definatly come back to this place if they had a better service."}
{"text":"Six of us went to Bachi Kitchen and had the worst experience.  It will be a while before we try this place again, if ever.  Two of us ordered the short ribs loco moco (included fried rice and macaroni salad).  One of us got short ribs on top of polenta and the other got short ribs on a bun with onions which was specifically requested to be omitted. When questioned that we got the wrong orders, we were told that they did not have fried rice and our meals were substituted without even asking us.  Another in our party ordered an omelet.  The omelet came runny, uncooked.  The omelet was returned.  Not a very pleasant experience.
Also, the salt on the table looked like pepper!  Thinking it was pepper, we all put salt on our food thinking it was pepper.  The waitress should have told us it was a special salt. We had to ASK for pepper!  What's up with that?  Why wasn't it on the table?????"}
{"text":"The burgers are absolutely delicious!!!  If you're looking for a typical burger this isn't the place.  They obviously add an Asian flare!  Good selection of craft beer too!  The chili sauce on the edemame was also delicious!

Definately expect a short wait.  But...  it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here because I saw it on the show Diners, Drive-In and Dives. And it was amazing the food was ridiculously good! I come out here once a week for work and I will be making my way back here at Bachi Burger very soon."}
{"text":"I don't know if anyone could ever convince me to re-review a restaurant, my first impression is typically good enough for me, and should be for everyone else. Even if you argue that I went to a location on an 'off day' I could really care less, if you are a professional and have opened a restaurant, there should be no such thing as an off day. I will however, go back to a place just for the pure enjoyment if it is good enough. Such is the case with Bachi Burger. I went many months ago, it's been one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas to date and I've had many people ask to go there with me. I've been twice in the last two weeks, and I'm not sure if I'm glad I went back.

Since my first visit, they have finally added a few permanent, lit signs to the outside of the building so its presence is a little more noticeable. The décor hasn't changed at all, with simple loose tables and chairs, plain white walls, and some Asian-inspired photos for sale. I went once for dinner in the middle of the week, and the other day again for lunch. Both times I was able to sit right away unlike the first time, but that's about where the consistency stops. The night I went for dinner it was fairly busy, but our waitress helped us right away with drinks, and took our orders fairly promptly. I had pretty good company that night so I can't remember how long our wait was for the actual food, but between the appetizer and burgers I don't think it was too bad.

My lunch visit was far worse. The friend I was with didn't quite know what she wanted to order right away, so after his first visit our waiter said he'd be back in a few minutes. I think we waited almost 20 minutes for him to return, and at least another 25 for our food to arrive once ordered. We sat down at 12:30pm in the middle of lunch, it was fairly busy but by the time we ordered the place had mostly cleared out so I didn't see why it would take that long. Her unpreparedness aside, our entire lunch took almost an hour and a half from sitting down to finishing our meal, far too long for folks that typically have an hour lunch break around town. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence during the day, but considering that two out of three meals I've eaten here were sub-par in the service category, I might be noticing a trend here.

The food itself is fantastic. Since having a Kiki burger on my first visit, I have since tried the Ronin burger and the Kalbi burger. Both burgers came out medium rare just as ordered, had all fresh, amazing toppings, and did not disappoint. The different combinations of kim chee, kalbi sauce, fried egg, and other Asian-inspired toppings are all succulent and the best examples of their flavor. I had the pickles during one meal which consisted of not your typical pickles, but pickled daikon, garlic, cauliflower and a few other items. It was delicious and different. Not too filling, but great flavor and a good prep for things to come. Both times I stuck to the parmesan and black truffle fries per request from my company at the table. The fries have great flavor, but during my most recent visit I had the chance to eat some of the fries with little seasoning on them near the bottom, and they weren't too great on their own. Still, all of the fries I have seen and tried here are loaded with seasoning and great in flavor.

I'm not going to bother giving Bachi a new score, the burgers have been incredibly consistent and fantastic, but the service is just not what it should be from visit to visit. If you're not on a lunch break or in a rush, it is well worth the visit and still in my opinion one of the best burgers you can have in town. If impeccable service is your thing, then you need to loosen up a bit and get in here to see what you're missing out on. And if you are an employee of Bachi, please take note of my service comments. I'm sure you get slammed during lunch time and at dinner, but respect the hour-long lunch break and try to find ways to get your customers in and out of there with some efficiency."}
{"text":"Not impressed... Went there tonight with my boyfriend, being recommended by several friends. Walked in and wad seated right away. The host rushed back to the table and threw the silverware down in hurry to greet the next guests... Next another server brings us waters and throws the straws on the table and takes off .. no interaction at all.. we wait 5 minutes fir another server to take our drink order (mind you there is only 5 other tables seated, and about 5 servers, so why a wait. Idk) he brings back our sodas and takes off... Wtf!! We look over the menu and wait another 5 minutes and yet another server comes to take our food order. We order 2 burgers an order of fries and calamari... The calamari comes out quickly so I feel ok so far... About 7 minutes go by and we finish the calamari and look forward to our burgers, but no server comes to our table. (Keep in mind there are only at this point 5 other tables. The two tables next to us order there burgers when we got the calamari and theres came out 10 minutes before ours) so we wait, and wait. Our server keeps walking past us,not ever glancing over to see that we are ready. Finally after about 20 minutes after we finished the appetizer our burgers (my boyfriend's first, then 2 minutes later mine) comes out. Fries were hot, burgers looked like they were forgotten about and left under heat lamps, and were not that impressive. I never received a soda refill, and we had to flag down a server for the check. I will not be back to this place again.. maybe I will try the bachi burger in henderson. Epic fail"}
{"text":"The Kalbi burger. YUM. Good sized portion. Kim chee goes well with it.
Get here a bit early because the place does get a line. Definitely not on the strip but it is worth the drive though."}
{"text":"Not for your ordinary burger
But a nice fusion of flavor, had the ban-mi burger and the truffle Parmesan fries.
The fries themselves are a reason to come back, only three stars for price and service . 
It's worth a second or third look"}
{"text":"I dream of Bachi Burger.  I visited in February while I was in Vegas on business.  Bachi Burger is the only reason to get a rental car.   A bit outside of downtown and located in an unassuming strip mall Bachi Burger was one of the best excursions.  When I think of Vegas I think of Bachi Burger.  When I think of Burgers I think of Bachi Burger.  Too bad I am so far away.  Best crabcake.  Best sweet potato fries.  Best dipping sauces.  My first try of a Bao Sandwich (Pork Belly Steamed Buns).  Bring a friend because you are going to want to try as many menu items as possible.  Fantastic menu with great thought put into pairing of flavors and ingredients.  I dream of Bachi Burger often.

Oh, and I love that they had food network on one tv and cooking channel on the other."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries but the oxtail chili cheese fries is the meal I would go for again and again.  I had the Miyagi burger which was 7 oz of American Wagyu and a fried egg and bacon and...  Pretty juicy and big and cooked medium rare-medium.

They also had $5 shakes that looked great but we were too full after eating burgers, sharing the chili cheese fries and also Parmesan truffle fries.  We remarked how many crispy shoes strings there were in one $5 order of fries.  The three of us shared it and didn't finish (your mileage may vary).

Both Bacchi Burgers are 15-20 minutes from the strip so you need to look for them.  The odd thing was the wait even though half of the tables were unoccupied the entire time we were waiting and eating."}
{"text":"Really good food. Great service. I think I'll try something else next time, but the Kiki was really good."}
{"text":"Had a hard time deciding between 3 or 4 stars, ultimately it comes down to the food, which is great. Plus I would love to see these guys succeed in the long run.

Servers were friendly enough, but everything just took far too long. It took forever to be seated, order our food, get the check, etc. We waited over 20 minutes for them to bring out our order, which they messed up. With that said, everyone was very nice and didn't hesitate to fix their mistake.

Atmosphere is nice with simple, modern decor, but the tables are crammed way too close together. We were literally sitting 2 inches from the people behind us.

I would love to come back because the food was good, but at the same time I dread the excruciatingly long wait. Perhaps they haven't had any prior restaurant experience?

We ordered the Peking Duck Buns, Bachi Burger, Banh-Mi Burger, Kalbi Burger, Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries, and Sweet Potato Fries. Everything tasted great.

If they can only get their act together and provide more timely service, I'm sure they would get a lot more 5 stars.


***UPDATE*** 

Went back a second time and the service was spot on! Food was just as good."}
{"text":"Just got here and you can no longer eat at the bar....bummer for a single person. A waste of unused space tonight. Also waitress knew NOTHING about the beer selection. Asked for my regular selection of arrogant bastard and it took her ten min to tell me they did not have it tonight. She knew nothing about any other beer. Finally got a beer after eating my meal. Not good. Burger ok but not so good without a beer!"}
{"text":"Love it!! 

All the food is good, but the sweet potato fries are the best ever! Love getting them with the garlic chili aioli. Also love getting the jasmine lemonade.

Wish they were still open til 2AM!"}
{"text":"We attempted Bachi Burger after watching the World Cup today. It was pretty busy and we were a tad cranky from the 116 degree heat out.  We were seated pretty quick despite the crowd near the entrance.  We shared the Spicy Miso Burger and the truffle fries.  It was a lot of food!  The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare (this is a lot to ask for at other places), the bun was delightfully light and fluffy.  It was at least a 3 napkin job due to the sauce and egg.  The truffle fries were good, but I think we would skip them for regular fries or garlic fries.  They used a truffle gravy.  I think a truffle salt or oil would be tastier.  Overall, the food transformed our moods and the staff was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on our last day in Las Vegas, and had been waiting since we planned our wedding and seen them featured on Triple D. We ordered the Oxtail Fries which are absolute heaven. Only need to caution they come loaded with jalapenos, and my husband isn't extremely fond of them ( i love them) and accidentally ingested a few pieces since they were covered by the delicious melty cheese gooeyness and chili cheese oxtail mixture. Not greasy, well balanced appetizer, wish there was one here in FL!. We ordered a burger each, he ordered the Kikki and I got the Miyagi. Both medium, served pink in the center, but not raw or bleeding, perfectly cooked. Meat still had the grilled taste, wasn't over seasoned, over all the burgers were well made. Definately favorite part was the fries, I was sad I didn't have room to try those yummy milkshakes listed, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"So good! What else need I say. Decor nice, service good, and the food one of the freshest examples of culinary bliss. Get a beer, new take on a burger some garlic fries and enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking of excuses to fly back across the country for the grass-fed wagyu burger. 5 stars for the best burger that I've ever tasted in my entire life. 4 stars because the pork buns were good but comparable to most. 

The combination of sweet, juicy and crunchy makes makes bachi live up to the hype. I HIGHLY suggest making the drive from the strip just to try."}
{"text":"I had the Oxtail chili cheese fries OUTSTANDING!!! I also like the green tea.  I have no problem recommending this spot for a quick bite.  The ambience is relaxed and so enjoyable.

You will be back every time you visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and great staff. I will be coming back fir the truffle fries and the kobe burger. This is definitely the best burger spot in town. Price is great especially for the quality and on top ofvgreat service my togo order was packed with everything i needed. I appreciate attention to detail. I did sit down and eat and a huge thank you to the feminine guy."}
{"text":"My rating would be 2 1/2 if that were available.

Overpriced for what you get and does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened up by our house.  Never disappointed and we leave satisfied, full, and always happy.  A must visit spot if you are looking for amazing burgers."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Guy was right, sublime!  Bahn Mi burger and truffle fries... Killer!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Bachi Burger opened this new location!  They make one of my favorite burgers: The Lonely Bird.  I know most people don't order this one, but it's a sleeper favorite :)  It's ground chicken/turkey prepared tsukune style with strong flavors of soy sauce and ginger, with an herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and beer battered onion rings.  So incredibly flavorful and delicious!  My husband ordered the Miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger and declared that he liked mine better!  I liked his too though...the beef was perfectly cooked and the combination of drippy fried egg, caramelized bacon, chili mayo, and onion rings was pretty amazing.  I wasn't a big fan of the Ronin burger.  The regular salt and pepper fries were thin and crispy, just the way I like it, although they could have used a bit more salt.  I will be back for my Lonely Bird burger...perhaps I will branch out one of these days and try the Banh-mi burger :)"}
{"text":"Great burger! Buns are fresh and I asked for a medium-rare patty; and they actually gave me a medium-rare patty! Good environment, friendly staff, well done burger joint!"}
{"text":"Finally found a restaurant that I like after recently moving here from San Francisco. Place was packed 8pm on a Sunday..incl the waiting area. Got the maui onion fries, chili edamame, Ronin burger, Kiki burger, and Bahn Mi burger :) Can't wait to come back!! I started telling all my friends about this place...getting the truffle fries next time!  Their steamed buns reminded me a little of Momofuku in NYC :)"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been wanting to come here for a while now. This placed definitely lived up to all the reviews that I have seen on here. Atmosphere was great, very casual. They definitely had no problem with kids there (unlike a certain dessert place we attempted to go to yesterday). The waitress was very friendly and checked back on us just the right amount of times (you know. Not too many where it was annoying, but just enough to know they're still keeping an eye on you). The food was excellent. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries to start off with. When it came out, hubby and I demolished that plate in about 5 minutes lol. This was our first time getting anything with oxtail in it. And it definitely didn't disappoint. The flavors on that plate were excellent with just enough spice, esp for preggo me. He ordered the ronin burger, I had the kiki's, and little one had the chicken karaage. Omg. Even after the chili cheese fries and my burger, I picked off a couple tiny pieces of the chicken just to taste. And boy, talk about light and fluffy breading haha. Everything we got was good stuff. Great service and food. Definitely coming back to try the other burgers and their ramen!"}
{"text":"So we decided to give bachi burgers one more try and we were still disappointed. When we arrived , the restaurant was not busy. A couple tables were already eating and one table was having their order taken. We waited at least five minutes before a waiter decided to take our drink orders.  We ordered appetizer fries with the drink order.  We saw our fries sitting on the hot line for awhile before they were brought to us.  And our burgers arrived right after.  So much for an appetizer.  Sadly the service was worse this time and it really doesn't matter how you order your burger temp ...med , med well and well done are all cooked med rare.  The service is slow and inattentive.  If I am paying 15$ for a burger I expect better than 2$ burger service.  I am always shocked when waiters and waitresses expect big tips when you have to practically beg for an order to be taken, drink refills are ignored and the waiter doesn't bother to see how the food is before the bill is left!  It's a shame they aren't reading their reviews, if they were they would know they haven't done a good job training their waiters-- lots of reviews comment on the bad service."}
{"text":"This place is basically an asian spin on burgers. The service and food is great, but the burgers take a LONG time to make. I recommend ordering the Ox Tail Chili Fries to start off and eat while you wait for your burger.

Also a good snack are the sausages or the shrimp chips.

As for the burger, we have tried them all. Our two favorites are the vietnamese Banh-Mi inspired one and the Ronin japanese inspired one. The rest are good, but these were the best (and that includes the foie gras burger).

Solid place, great flavor, good prices.  Just be patient waiting for your delicious burger."}
{"text":"Love this place and now combined with great ramen.   So why so low.... 1pm Monday post Xmas week and 35 min wait. BUT. 10 tables of 2+ free and was told they were seating slow to deal with demand.  WTF. If I owned the place I would die.....only 12 people waiting and a wait with open tables????? 

Thought them to be foodie restaurant .. Leading edge....they gave us a coupon to go to their other restaurant 10 miles away.....Really?

Went to Zenshin close by.... Vote with your feet!"}
{"text":"Floor was very sticky and there was a weird bad yeasts smell in the air, we were wondering how long ago was the beer spilled on the floor!? One said 3 days ago, the other said last night, I was in a forgiving mood and said, hopefully not too long before we came.. Also had a very large piece of onion peel with my hamburger, we were a party of three but only two of us were ordering food, the waiter did not bring a third plate and we needed to wait a long time till he showed up again so we could ask for a third plate although they were told we will be sharing. The food does not taste bad, especially considering the fact it is not a low cost place, would expect management/staff to make sure the place is clean!?"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. 

The chef and the GM works very hard from what I can see. GM Guy Imperial does more then above and beyond to his guest.

Everytime i go in there i felt like i get the VIP treatment. They make sure that the diner gets the \" Where everybody knows your name\" feeling.

Great job fellows. Kepp up the good work. I for one will return to Bachi Burger over and over again.

Your friend

Joe C."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. We have tried some Diners, Drive Ins and Dives restaurants before with unsatisfying results. However, we were in the area and I had to try it. So glad that we did. My burger was THE BEST BURGER that I've ever had. Then I tried my wife's burger which was equally phenomenal. You have to go here if you are in Vegas. The service was great as well. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is almost always busy and there is always a wait for around 30 min give or take.  But for good reason. The burgers are pretty dang good. The side dishes are good and they have a decent bar with some good craft beer offerings."}
{"text":"Business traveler (party of 1) review:
Saw the # of reviews, the DDD (diners, drive-ins, & dives) show & had to check it out.
Day 1: 
Great local seasonal beer. Had the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries: absolutely incredible (A+). Had the Mayagi-San Wagyu burger: definitely enjoyed, might have expected a more blow your hair back experience (B+). 
Liked it so much, came back the next day:
Day 2:
Another great local beer. Had the best server I've prob had in 5yrs (Jim). Got the Spicy Miso Burger customized w/ Wagyu beef (thx Jim): A++++. Just incredible. Had teased this item on day 1 and was talked out of it by day 1 server. No fault/harm, but I much preferred the Spicy Miso. Just awesome. Also had the GRILLED KUROBUTA & ARABIKI SAUSAGE app; also amazing (A+).
Topped day 2 off w/ the donuts and coffee ice cream which was decadent and filling (B+). More than I needed, but could't be more pleased.

Perfect for the business traveler one-off. 

Server (Jim) was one of the best servers I've ever had. Thx bro. Give this guy a raise."}
{"text":"We have been to Bachi burgers many times.  We noticed both service and food quality have gone downhill.  They may have more varieties than before, but they are not getting any better.  The patties are smaller and greasier than used to.  It took longer than usual to get served and drinks.  I can get a better burger from Rockys around the corner.  We will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat there. No reservations just walked in. Was told 10 minutes. Gave our name for their list. After 20 min wait same size group they were called ahead of us. Raised question why before us. Hostess did not know there was a list. We got seated just two of us and a 1 year old. They gave us four menus. I explained that the one year doesn't read yet and there were only the two adults. We set down and started to look at the menu. Short time passed but seemed long due to our frustration. We got up and left. Felt that  the food service was going to be like getting a table."}
{"text":"I dont understand the hype. Service is slow and inconsistent.  Our server forgot to bring our drinks, we got fries and our pepper appetizer at the same time. Who eats fries before the burger? Our burgers were cooked well but goodness there is way too much going on in a burger to say it's tasty.  Too much flavor overwhelms, sometimes minimal is good.  

Environment is hip and sleek."}
{"text":"Heard nothing but good things about this place so i had to check it out. Bachi Burger is like an asian influenced build your own burger place. Had the Just Fries, Garlic Salt & Pepper fries, Truffle Parmessan fries, Sweet Potato fries and Kurobuta and Arabiki Sausages. And yes, i did have help eating all of this. Ordered the Kiki's Burger which included asst. asian mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade and a garlic chili aioli sauce. Good stuff!! You must visit this place if you're a burger fan!!"}
{"text":"OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES.  This clearly is the most popular dish at this place.  Every table around us had this on their table, every.  The service was spotty as we visited during lunch.  After our starters, the food began to settle in and the mile high burgers finally came out.  At this point, I was stuffed, but had to put down this spicy miso burger.  It's not the cheapest place for a lunch, but it's so worth it.

Oxtail chili cheese fries: By far one of the best dishes I've ever consumed.  The shredded oxtail was so tender, the flavor of the chili has a sweetness to it and it goes so well with the salty fries. The sunny side up egg just makes it even better.  Truly amazing, it's a must get and you'll be disappointed if you don't.

Pork Belly Buns: Not all that but still good.  I really enjoyed the bao dunked in their hoisin mixture and the touch of cilantro and radish gives it a great fresh touch.

Spicy miso burger: This this had to be at least 6\" high, piled with toppings and goodness. What makes their burgers so unique is the Taiwanese sweet bun, soft, fluffy, and chewy, what a burger bun should be. There are so many great flavors in this piece, it was delicious, from garlic to peppers, onions, and a fried egg. The patty was cooked perfectly, medium.

If you're in Vegas, this place is a must.  Make a trip here, it's worth the short drive off of the strip.  As we left lunch, the place was packed and had a line outside the door.  I recommend going early.  It's a nice place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here on a lazy Monday afternoon. The place wasn't very busy (only three other tables seated). Had to wait a few minutes before being greeted at the door, but it wasn't long enough to complain about. 

Our server was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable about the menu. 

Kiki burger, spicy miso burger, and Parmesan truffle fries were all pretty decent (even though the spicy miso burger literally had no hint of heat).

The only disappointment is that our server forgot to put in the chocolate peanut butter soufflé. The dessert takes 20-25 minutes to prepare and we ordered it at the same time as our food. He said he would put it in five minutes after our food comes out so that it would still be hot by the time we were done with the burgers...but obviously forgot to do so. 

I guess it was an honest mistake, but we were really looking forward to that soufflé and waiting another half hour for it after our meal was not an option. Again, it wasn't even busy at all so I don't know how he forgot. 

Another girl had taken over our table for him and ended up giving us a peanut butter chocolate milkshake to make up for the soufflé. She was even considerate enough to put some berries in it so it was like the soufflé. 

As a side note - I can understand some of the other negative/impartial reviews about service. Not all of the servers were attentive/friendly. We did have to keep waiting for refills on our waters."}
{"text":"One of the best places for hamburgers in Las Vegas, particularly if you like Asian fusion hamburgers.  The french fries are excellent.  Service can be a little slow."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, liked the sweet potato fries; OK ramen.

On a short visit to LV, my sister's family and I went for lunch on a Monday, about 1:30 there was a 15-minute wait. We had edamame, which was good but not everyone's going to like it; regular and sweet potato fries, the latter being noticeably better than the former but both were good; Miyagi burger is five-star; kimchee burger (forgot the menu name) is nearly as good, the plain burger (for the 4-yr old) was good too.  Nice selection of beer; the Rogue River Hazelnut Ale is very good.

The next day, my sister and I went back for a ramen fix.  We split an order of the duck bao, I must not have had duck for a long time because I've probably tried it many years ago and vaguely remember not been impressed, and I wasn't here, either.  The rest of the bao was done just right, I'll try the pork belly bao next time for comparison.  We both had the tonkatsu ramen, she thought it was good.  I agree for the most part, but to me the broth was a bit on the sour side, and the pork belly didn't strike the right note for some reason.  The noodles and egg were OK.  I've had better ramen recently in NYC.

I'll go back, the miyagi burger alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Shogun burger was DELICIOUS. The seared foie was so buttery and went so well with the poached Asian pear. I asked to have my burger cooked mid-rare and it was perfectly cooked. 
Kiki burger and Mr. Ho's burger were also very good. 

Also got the oxtail chili fries. Personally, I thought the beans in the chili were just barely undercooked but it was awesome besides that and three of us killed the plate.  

Service was great. Even though the place was packed, someone was always making sure our water was filled and we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"First off, it was a little bit hard to find going west on Windmill. The parking and door is around behind Subway. I think there was another door on the Windmill side it looked like.

I met a couple of my friends here for lunch at around 12. It was not that busy when we got there, but 30 mins later bigger parties starting arriving and seemed to get busy.

I got the kalbi burger which was topped with kim chee and a kochujung mayo. SO FREAKING GOOD! It came with a side of cucumber kimchee as well. Surprisingly, I would have liked it to be a tad bit more spicy, but the flavors were all there. 

I got a side of the truffle parmesan fries as well, and those were very very delicious. I haven't tried anything with truffles before but heard its awesome. And.. IT WAS. 

My friend got the ronin buger, and he said he didn't care for it too much. He didn't really like the pickled slaw. My other friend got the peking duck steamed buns, which looked awesome! We both thought it was weird that it had boiled egg in it. But she said it was really tasty, but could've used less of the cilantro. The next time, I will get that, and I love cilantro so hopefully they pile it on.

I got my boyfriend the bahn mi burger to-go since he was at work. So, we shall see if he likes it.. Then we can return, so he can get the full dining experience.

I have to say.. service kind of sucks here. Or at least when I was there. We never got our waters filled until we had to ask. Expect to wait 15-20 mins for the food.. but worth it for the food. We waited for a good 15 mins with an empty table and to-go bags, and ended up going up to the cashier to try to get our checks, where they said they'd be with us shortly. We had to wait another 10 mins before we got our check. With our waiter passing us, he didn't take our check with payment, so I ended going back to the cashier to pay. I saw another table try at least 3 times to get their waiter's (same guy) attention for something. The woman finally went up to guy to let him know they needed something.

Overall, service was definitely lacking.. but the food most definitely NOT. Will be back again to try that peking duck!"}
{"text":"LOVE Bachi Burger!  Best burgers we have had.  The Mr. Ho's on the taro bun is simply amazing.  The Black & Blue is another favorite of ours.  All of the fries are wonderful, but the sweet potato fries are my favorite.  IF you have room for dessert after the main course, try the Portuguese donuts.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great burger. So nice to see a small local restaurant doing well. The food is amazing, the service was good...

Going back today for lunch again"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at bacchi burger (except by the wait).  There are some really unique dishes.  I love the miyagi san burger (sp?)"}
{"text":"This is a good casual place to eat a quick lunch or dinner with friends. Decor is nice inside and the waiters are very attentive, I never had to ask for a refill of water.

As others have mentioned, the oxtail chili cheese fries are a must. Don't underestimate the portion, it's a huge plate of fries slathered with yummy oxtail sauce goodness with melted cheese and beans. I usually share it with 2 other friends and we are all basically half full before our burgers even arrive.

In terms of the burgers, they have interesting options here but nothing stands out to me that much, though they also have big portions (compared to Umami). Overall a unique restaurant with good price and service"}
{"text":"When you're middle aged and been married for double digits, you start to not care if a restaurant is hip or trendy.  You just want good food.  This place, located in a small, suburban, strip mall, is decorated with open ceiling painted black, colorful prints of Asian cities, fake bamboo mats, and cheap track lighting.  Just the sort of place for young Asians with Pink hair and dragon tattoos.  But with all this hipness, it also delivers some delicious food.  I don't give 5 stars readily, but for these flavors and reasonable prices, I couldn't give anything less.

So forget about the ambiance and go for the great food.  While billed as a burger joint and food shaped like one, this not just a hamburger but rather a fusion of western comfort food with Asian and Polynisian enhancements done with great success.  The meat is high quality and generous.  The flavors integrated and complex.  Don't ask me what the names of the ingredients are because I think they are in another language, but they are delicious none-the-less.

A few things we have tried:

Sweet Potatoe fries:  thinner cuts of sweet potatoe, fried, and lightly salted with sea salt.  Comes with a sauce that is slightly spicy.

Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries: slightly spicier than the sweet potatoe, but I like it better.  The sauce is also spicy.

Kiki's Burger:  This is lighter flavored burger, slightly sweet with mild cheese.  Really good for the sensitive palate.

Kalbi Burger:  The first time we visited, my wife was scared.  She couldn't recognize any of the ingredients. When I pointed out that this burger had Kim Chee, which she likes, she gave it a try.  This burger is loaded with flavor.  It has sweeter flavors from the teryaki offset with sharper flavors of onion and garlic.  The Kim Chee offers a nice crunch.  This is my wife's favorite burger.

Spicy Miso:  This burger is loaded with flavors.  The egg is a real addition to the spicyness and meld of teryaki and onion.  This is probably my favorite so far.

Bachi Fish:  If you want to go a little lighter, the fish sandwich is outstanding.  Again, lots for flavors that meld.  The fish says it is pan seared but looked like it was fried.  But not too greasy and not overcooked.

All sandwiches are between 9 and 14 dollars and are ala carte.  So with two burgers and an order of fries, enough for my wife and I, total will come to about $30 including tax and tip.  While it might sound like a bit much for a burger, the flavors make it a bargain.

On the drink menu is an impressive list of some of the best beers on the market.  Based on that, I imagine the Saki is good, too.  But I haven't tried either.  Either will add about $10 onto your bill.  I guess I'm a little too cheap to go the extra distance.

So ingore all the BMW and Lexus machines out front and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Saw them on Food Networks Diners, Drive-ins & Dives.  There was a bit of a wait which can be considered a good sign.   The food did not disappoint!  Very good flavor on everything we ordered.    Will come back when I return to Vegas.   
 I would have rated 5 Stars if the hostess was friendly.  She didnt smile at all and didnt offer a menu to look at while we waited for our table."}
{"text":"Slow service. A lot of people who were waiting before us left cause they were so slow, AND there were empty tables. Got seated and waited a good 30 min for our food.

Burgers were good, I got the oxtail chili cheese fries. So not worth it, barely any oxtail, it was more like beans, cheese, and fries. Overall, stick to the burgers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They are super friendly, great service and the food is super tasty. Try the homemade sodas..sooo good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Good service, good food and good atmosphere. I  ordered the bun mi burger and it did not disappoint. It was bursting with flavor. Every bite was delicious. Also had the chili cheese ox tail fries and they were just as delicious. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"First time here this past weekend! I'm a true burger fan, I love Slaters, the Counter, and many other places, but this place definitely makes my top 2. I have never had trouble picking out what I wanted while ordering because every burger on their menu sounded so good... Definitely a new experience because this restaurant is Asian fusion and what a great idea it is... a chinese burger. lol 

First off, Garlic. Parmesan. Truffle FRIES. Best one I've had yet. The truffle oil/sauce they sprinkle over the fries are just so delicious.. and the tomato dipping sauce? Damn. I also wanted to get the oxtail fries.. but I think I would've exploded or something.. I pretty much breathed the truffle fries in, cause it was so good lol I ordered the Black & Greens burger with wagyu beef (grass fed beef) and it was definitely a noticeably good quality beef. And the way they marinated brought out so much (asian) flavor on top of the caramelized onions and mushrooms.. I could barely finish it cause how filling it was (I also blame the fries). My gf got the Miso burger I think and it tasted more like a Korean burger lol very sweet and spicy, super flavorful. (I preferred my burger more lol)

We came to this location cause it's less packed, yes it's farther but it was worth the 0 minute wait. and very spacious seating and parking outside too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. 

I had the Bahn Mi, my friend had the Black and Green and my daughter had the Shogun. A bit pricy, but very, very tasty. 

I will go back, but next time I won't let her order the Shogun at $26! Haha, unless she's paying the bill. Mind you, she had never had foie gras, so this was her big chance."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to go to the place and it was a great experience except for the wait. Be aware of the wait!!! Approximately a 20 minute wait or more for a table of two. In addition, no greet, I had to go up to the counter and make sure our name was on the waiting list."}
{"text":"So I'll start off by saying the food was really great, the miyagi-San Burger was great. Okay with that out of the way, I can say that from door to getting food was an HOUR and it wasn't that busy. The staff seemed elusive and hard to find when you needed something. The place had a hipsterish feeling like they didn't need you there."}
{"text":"The Burger, Ramen and Fries are worth to come back again and again. Basically food is great here.  However, the service is mediocre.  And when you happened to come across Alex or Aries, beware. This one is so inconsiderate and dishonest.  We signed in for a table snd he gave us 25 mins waiting time.  Since the waiting room is full, we asked him to give us a call instead.  He obliged and promised that he will.  We will just wait  inside our car.  
Forty five minutes has passed there was no call and when we checked our status, we learned that he skipped us twice.  Its was not a matter of how many people will fit in available table. That was not the case as it was not his reason when I confronted him.  He even told us to wait for another 10 minutes.  The nerve. 
Luckily, John the other server pacified us and gave us another table. And his service and attitude is commendable.  
Alex or Aries or should I call him Brutus ( Popeye's enemy) came and apologized but I felt no sincerity in his action.  
I bet he is used to saying and promising things he can not deliver.  He is so inconsiderate and dishonest.  He knows that people go there very hungry,  want to eat, be served right away and leave.  
There are people who truly deserve  his job and will be an asset to the company."}
{"text":"It's good, but kind of bland.  I had their green and black burger, and my bf has their miso burger. Miso was actually better than the green/black burger. Their beef patty and buns were actually tender and soft, respectively, but even after adding salt that was provided, it was just a regular gourmet burger joint. Nothing special. Their oxtail fries were good for large groups, but it was ok also. This place is better than Gordon Ramsay's BurGR though."}
{"text":"Bachi burger never fails to disappoint. I always get the Kano burger with fried egg. Pretty much any of the burgers with fried egg is always good. I still have yet to try a burger there that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  A different flair on the average burger, and what a tasty flair it is!  The service left something to be desired. Friendly, but almost non-existent.  But the food is worth dealing with it.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers and drink selections here, wish it was an easier dining experience though."}
{"text":"Came across this place on a whim, but glad I stopped in. Defiantly has some unique burgers on the menu. I went with a pork and beef burger with Chinese sausage on a Taro bun. Also had some mushrooms on it. Good flavor and the taro bun actually had taro flavor to it! Bad part of the meal would be that the fries did not come with the burger, everything is ala cart.  I liked the sauce that came with the fries. Would recommend anyone to come here that's going to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great burger, and management handles things in a very professional manner!"}
{"text":"Influenced to go by watching Triple D on food network and was excited to finally had a chance to come here. However, left a bit disappointed, probably due to high expectations. The menu offers a good variety of options and concepts that most might not have experienced before but did not come to a surprise for us. We ordered the Oxtail chili cheese fries and a medium Mr. Ho's burger recommended from most  reviews. The burger had a great flavor profile especially the unique taro bun that complements everything nicely. The oxtail fries were a bit overhyped. The portions were more than enough for 2 ppl however, fries and chili cheese did not taste so great. We didn't get much oxtail considering the size of the plate and tasted mostly beans than anything. The egg is a nice touch though. Service was good for the most part and finding parking shouldn't be a problem. The menu is a bit overpriced especially for a burger and steamed buns.

Tip: Does the place offer a great concept of tradition to modern in their food? Yes. Worth the price? Not so much... especially if the quality of taste was subpar and if you're craving for a burger, I would recommend looking eslewhere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, well the food at least. (atmosphere is so-so) The burgers here are nothing but magnificent. With an Asian infused menu, all of the burger choices garner not so typical ingredients. I have tried 3 different burgers and haven't been disappointed. The patty is grilled to perfection and the ingredients are fresh. I would recommend trying this place. Price is a bit on the high side, but once you are finished you will not regret the price one bit."}
{"text":"Call the health department about the raw food and fire Frank the manager!!!!!!  

I went to Bachi Burger tonight on the recommendation of a friend.  I ordered a Kiki Burger medium rare.  I typically like hamburgers rare, but this was a burger in a restaurant, so I ordered it medium rare.  I was so hungry I was five bites in before I realized what I was eating....the burger was raw inside.  I asked my friend who was a chef to look too, and she confirmed that it was raw.   Not to mention, it was horribly sweet.  I would have ignored the bad taste, I was starving, but it was disgusting inside.  Raw and cold inside.  

The manager came over to check on us and I didn't want to say anything, but my husband piped up and said \"her burger is rare, and she doesn't like it so she would like to order something else.\"  Rather than take the plate away and apologize, he started to argue with my husband.  He said \"that is how we serve our burgers and if you don't like it, you should have ordered it another way.\"  My husband said \"you are out of your mind if you think that is medium rare....where do you go from here if someone wants a rare burger?  You haven't left yourself any room to be more raw.\"

So, now I am uncomfortable.  I didn't want to say anything in the first place, but the manager did ask.  He took the plate away.

He came back, with the plate in his hand, and demanded my name.  He sort of stood there and asked as if he was going to write my name on the wall in the back.  I was speechless.  My husband told him his name and demanded to know why I was being asked.  The manager then said that he had had a discussion with another manager and they \"were concerned that the burger had been half eaten.\"  I was shocked.  He started attacking me and demanding to know why I had eaten as much of the burger as I had if I \"really didn't like it\" and that under no circumstances would they refund any money!   

My husband and I are quite comfortable financially.  We have been fortunate enough to retire well and early and the last thing I would ever do is to try to scam half a hamburger from someone.  Moreover, we never asked to get anything for free.  Now, that doesn't mean I wouldn't expect a decent restaurant to offer.   I have sent food back maybe 5 times in my whole life, and each of those times I was offered free food and had to fight to pay for it anyway.  Most of the time it isn't their fault if I don't like something.  But, this was different....the food was raw.   Even still, we didn't ask for anything for free.   

My husband was so angry, as was my friend.  I just wanted to crawl under the table and die.  This manager is standing there yelling at me for something I haven't done.  We were ready to walk out, when the manager walked away.  It was only because of the waiter that we stayed.  He was so very kind.  

The manager then comes back a little while later and tries to apologize.  But, in doing so he makes the snarkiest little comment....he says he will take 25% off and he will give me the burger I sent back in a box to go.  The last thing I wanted was to ever see that burger again.  It was disgusting.  My husband said, if he wanted to take 25% off the check as an apology that might satisfy him.  But, boy was I miserable.  I have so far been fed terrible raw food, been yelled at for not liking it and then treated like a dog when I was told I should take that food home and eat it later..and why did they still have it?   

When we were ready to go, I found out the manager had taken a lousy 2.50 off!  Turns out he meant he would take 25% off the price of the ten dollar disgusting burger, not the whole check as he should have.  I was vomiting in the bathroom at this time or I would have demanded that we pay the extra $2.50, I don't need his lousy money.  Oh, yes...I was vomiting in the restroom.  It is 5 hours later and I am still doubling over from cramps.  Was it the burger?  Either that, or the potato chips I had earlier in the day.  My bet is on the burger.  
 
I should have taken that mealy burger to go so I could show it to the health department.  

My friend was so embarrassed that she had suggested the place, my husband was put in a miserable position, and I was in tears (at least on the inside, on the outside, I think I kept the tears from falling.)  Why did he ask my name?  Why did he tell me that it was my fault that I didn't know that medium rare meant raw inside to them?  Why did he assume I was trying to steal from him?  I am a size 8.  do I look like someone who tries to steal a half a hamburger?  Why did I eat that awful burger and have to have these awful cramps all night?  Oh why oh why did I ever go to Bachi burger????

 
Update:  The owner was kind and after he heard about this said that Frank had been spoken to and he apologized deeply and said this is not the kind of service they expect...and he gave my friend a gift card and even waited on us when we retur"}
{"text":"So good, i could die, It's a gourmet burger and you really get what you pay for. It's a great vibe, super nice decor, asian fusion style bugers. I come here everytime because all burgers on the strip disappoint. Ronin burger is a great great burger to start off with, come back and try everything. There is boba so that is a huge plus if you are having that asian craving inside you, I know everyone has it. Service is great and I always leave happy and full. My tongue and heart sing in harmony as a take every bite, and the heavens ring as the joy of my stomach reaches fullness and its enlightenment."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago we tried this burger, to die for, every thing we ordered was excellent very tasty. I highly recommend with tourist, and locals"}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good sandwich, so my wife and I checked this place out for dinner. We ordered the fish sandwich, crusty crab and sweet potato fries. The presentation of the food was great and everything tasted really good too. Their whole thing is to serve gourmet burgers and sandwiches with a Asian twist. All and all, it worth a visit."}
{"text":"Yes, it was a good burger. It's not your traditional ketchup , mustard  and mayo combination. They have turned a ordinary burger into a flavor experience. If you enjoy a regular burger , it might take you a bit to acquire the different flavors these burgers bring. Over all, very different but flavorful. Small Kids will not likely enjoy a place like Bachi so plan to make it a date spot"}
{"text":"Their burgers are one of a kind and definitely delicious! Must try the spicy miso burger and oxtail fries! Great service even tho they did not have enough cups to serve our drinks. The server was kind enough to apologize each time she returned to our table and admit that they do not have enough cups."}
{"text":"Get ready to lose a couple of hours and be ignore or attended.  The Manager took our menus and we don't even order.  The place was empty only three family.   The bus boy was great he refill or water like 4 times is a shame that he cant take our order he was very attentive.

 If a place not have a minimum of customer service it not worth return to this place.

we just left, before we lose our money"}
{"text":"Yelp said this place was gluten free. I expected gluten free buns, however their \"protein style\" is a burger patty on mixed greens. It was ssooooo good!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best burger! I had the black and green burger, the bun was amazing and the toppings were a great combination. Fries were perfect we had the salt and pepper fries which had jalapeños and cilantro ..   Waitress could've been friendlier but the food was so good we chose not worry about it. We will visit every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Went their for the first time and the waiter was extremely helpful with telling us what his favorites were and the popular burgers and appetizers were. Everything is a la carte so it can get a bit pricy but one of my favorite burger restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Truffle fries were amazing! I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get a burger because I'm allergic to shrimp and evidently that is their secret ingredient. However, the turkey burger was awesome! My husband got oxtail chili fries and the Miyagi Burger. He said they were awesome... rivals Tim Love's dirty love Burger."}
{"text":"Had my fair share of a few burgers here, and I will say, It's food that evokes a \"wow\" response and steady head nod of pleasant surprise and satisfaction. 

Although all their burgers are awesomely crafted and unique in their own respective category, my personal favorites to my taste would have to be both the Miyagi-Sans burger and the Black & Green burger.

The Miyagi-san is a grass fed wagyu burger with furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. The flavors aren't overdone and easily craveable. As for the Black & Green, it's a grass fed waygu as well, with mushrooms, spinach, point reyes blue cheese (Medium/full flavored), roasted garlic and bacon. Very deep and rich without being too strong and overpowering. If you are a fan of blue cheese this burger does your fandom some righteous justice. Bonus is that their buns are fresh, sweet and made local! Mmm, respect.

For fries, I go for the Truffle Parmesan and if I have a partner to share with, the oxtail chili fries is the perfect plate with plenty to go around. for dessert, I have only had the chance to try their donuts. Covered in some quality cinnamon sugar and matched with a perfectly complimenting mocha ice cream. Although, tends to be a bit doughy and undercooked as I have come to find.

Service is service, nothing really outstanding or outlandish, but prompt and knowledgeable about their food. All in all I appreciate this place because the attention to quality and detail, and in that respect they put out some amazingly delicious and unique food."}
{"text":"this place is great!

Stick with the burgers.  We tried the sausage plate and hot dog and neither were that exciting.

I love the duck and pork belly baos.  I would have liked to try the short rib one but they told me they took it off the menu.  The Banh mi burger was also very good.

I would love to give this place 5 starts bu the location is not great for people staying on the Strip--about $20 cab each way from Mandalay, which basically doubles the price of anything on the menu.  5starts is you have your own ride but not worth the cab ride.  

Please open a location on the Strip!  Please!!"}
{"text":"Came here,  waited for so long and it wasn't even busy.  Waited for over 20 minutes to be seated then waited 10+ minutes to finally have someone acknowledge us. Then we were told the Shoyu ramen place is closed.  I wish they had told us when we waited because they should in case people want to get ramen but they failed to do so.  Terrible.  Walked out and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We ordered the Oxtail Chilli Cheese Fries, Wagyu Burger (done Kiki style) and the Black Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen. The burger and ramen were amazing, and greatly savoured by us. However, the fries were a disappointment - they didn't taste very special and we wished that we had ordered something else instead. 

Service wasn't too great either; our server greeted and took the orders of the table next to us even though we had been seated before them, and we had been waiting for a little bit waiting for someone to take our orders. Their food also came out before ours, even though in the end we managed to place our orders before them as they needed more time to decide on their orders."}
{"text":"Visited this place on my last Vegas trip. Was a bit far from the strip but worth the taxi fare.  I underestimated the heat from the kalbi burger in combination with the ox tail fries (my own fault).   Going back on my next trip to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Second visit, if you worship great burgers then try it out. Some of the favors might not be for everyone but they work for me. Fresh, fast, fun and fantastic. Having tried the calamari, the sweet potato fries and several of the burgers I love their food."}
{"text":"Wow we are soo glad we made the trip!  The wait was short (30 mins) and the food was well worth it.

We had the oxtail fries, chili Wings followed by the black and green burger.

Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great service! Even better music. No complaints. Their fries are AMAZING! Will likely go back again to try more of their menu options."}
{"text":"It was good. We felt rushed, but otherwise everything was tasty. The wait was nominal. The food looked exactly as pictured in the menu...that was a welcome surprise."}
{"text":"OMG.... these burgers are awesome! Juicy, beautiful, goodness, presented picture perfect and seasoned with flare. Our party has several different burgers and all were delicious and done as requested. The fries were great and ample enough to share. Service was great... our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable when we couldn't decide which burger to order! 

Top it off with the salty caramel marshmallow shake for dessert... to die for! Really... just when you thought they couldn't do anything different with a shake. Kinda like a sundae in a glass, but with the subtle nuance of sweet and salty and an awesome homemade marshmallow.

Be prepared to wait... always a line!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant.  My friend and I have been hearing so many wonderful things about this place so two nights ago we stopped in.  We shared the sweet potato fries as an appetizer.  I for sure give that a 5 star.  He had the regular burger cooked to his liking and said it was truly the best he has had.   I tried the  veggie burger.  All I have to say it was the best veggie burger I have ever had.   And let me tell you I have had many!!!!  Mushrooms, tofu, cilantro, greens and much more.   The prices are right and the food is amazing.   Our server Tammy is one of the best I have every had and managed.  She knew the menu, she was funny, nice and attentive.  I want her to work for me."}
{"text":"Just when I thought that fusion food was nothing more than sad attempts to gimmick people into eating their food and was going to give up on the trend completely, Bachi Burger came along and completely changed my mind. This place does fusion right by taking it seriously and putting tons of detail into everything on their menu. The ingredients are fresh and diverse. All the items on the menu have a unique taste which makes you want to try everything on the menu at least once. 

If you are not a burger person that is fine, they have great non-beef options like the crusty-crab burger and the salmon burger. Both are great and possibly healthier alternatives to the normal beef burger. Also the Pork Belly Buns are freaking amazing and really make you doubt getting a burger when you could have those. All the burgers I have tried are great especially the special ones that are not included on the menu. 

If you go and it is your first time you have to order the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. They could just serve those and I would keep going back for more.

They also serve craft beers which gives them an automatic bump in the ratings. :)"}
{"text":"I really recommend the manga burger. It's delicious. They're also usually out of it. Not sure if they don't reorder or something... Sometimes the service is exceptional, while other times it falls a bit under mediocre.
The last time I went, they were out of manga burgers (of course), so I thought I'd try one of their noodles. Huge mistake. The tan tan mien was horrible. The consistency made me want to throw up. I also received my noodles cold and hard. Ew. 
The only reason I'm giving it three stars is for the good customer service I sometimes receive and for the manga burger, which they rarely have in stock... And the oxtail and the truffle fries."}
{"text":"I typically don't like burgers, and I didn't have a good experience here the first time, but my most recent visit changed my mind. The manga burger and truffle fries are on point. The atmosphere is nice, and staff checked up on us and refilled our waters whenever needed. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Food was great... Service could be way better. Waited 15 min for a beer and soda.  Another server dropped off our drinks. Didn't see our server long periods of time.  Overall I am a fan, probably ask for a different server."}
{"text":"Great fusion burger restaurant. Mr. Ho burger was fantastic. Unlike anything I'd had before. The hoisin mayo perfectly complimented the burger and bun."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town. My favorite burger is the spicy miso burger with the truffled fries! It's always really busy so it might be a good idea to check the wait before making the drive. I think they should work on moving to a larger space! The food is so delicious the wait can be worth it."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying the food is delicious. 5 star worthy! I had the oxtail chilli cheese fries as well as the banh mi burger. Unfortunately our experience there was terrible because of the hostess at the front desk. 

One member of our group recently tore his achilles and had a brace on. He was not ordering any food and wanted to sit down. The hostess stopped him from grabbing a seat, luckily another employee saw what was going on and offered to grab a seat for him. If not for the other employees and our server (who was attentive and provided great customer service), I would give this location a 1 star. Can't let one rotten egg spoil the rest. 

This past weekend was a memorable one for my best friend's bachelor party unfortunately the hostess at bachi burger left us with a not so memorable one."}
{"text":"I'vebtried just about everything and it is always delicious. Best burger's ever. Ever. The pineapple ketchup is amazing as well. Even their milkshakes are like no other. Just go; order one of everything and prepare for the best week of your life ;-D"}
{"text":"The only thing i thing about this place is that it's a bit pricey for example I got a the Spicy miso burger it was I believe 14 or 13 dollars. Don't get me wrong it's one of the best burgers I've ever had but I would have liked if it came with fries along with it instead of paying another 4-5 bucks for fries. My bf got the Mr Ho burger that one was delicious as well and his was like 17 dollars. Overall burgers were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely sensational a great atmosphere and amazing selection on the menu. Staff were great with recommendations and really know their stuff. Well worth the trip away from the strip if you are in Vegas and want fantastic food"}
{"text":"On Nov. 29, 2013, Fri, we were extremely excited to dine at Bachi Burger since it would be our first time.  And to say that we were satisfied with our meal is to say the least.  We were not disappointed with the food, the burgers were really good and the steamed buns with pork belly was awesome.  However, the appetizers were ok...nothing exciting.  I would actually give the food a 4.5 stars.

Now on to the service...this is the reason for the 1 star.  I am TRUELY upset with the service of the Summerlin location.  The wait time to be seated was decent.  After we were seated and finally ordered our food, we waited 45 mins to just be served our appetizers.  The restaurant wasn't even crowded, there was still a station that was closed and they were not seating anyone there.  We were so hungry by the time we got our food, we excitedly ate it and enjoyed it very much.  So we didn't even notice that we did not get our calamari.  Being satisfied and full, we paid our $159.99 bill, along with the automatic 18% gratuity of $26.64, totalling $186.63 and left. When we got home, I had looked at the receipt and realized that we never received our $12 calamari appetizer.  With that, I called Bachi Burger right away to let them know what had happened and the hostess that answered the call said that they were TOO BUSY to have me talk to the restaurant manager and that she would have him call me back later on that night when they slowed down.  So of course I waited and did not receive a call back.  I then called on Saturday when they opened and was able to speak to the restaurant manager, PHYROM.  I told him what had happened and explained that I had called the night before and let him know that we not receive our calamari appetizer.  He then started to interrogate me as to why I did not bring it up when we were there.  I explained that we were excited about being there, extremely hungry due to our 45 min wait, and then being satisfied at the end.  In not so many words, he basically accused me of lying about it.  REALLY?!!!! I would seriously call that night and then the next day to lie about not getting our appetizer.  If the appetizer was say $5 I could care less about calling back but this was the most expensive item on our bill.  All PHYROM kept saying was \"you have to understand my point, why did you not tell us at the time of your meal that you did not receive your appetizer?\"  I basically told him that all I want is to get the $12 refund and that's it.  I guess PHYROM got tired of my complaining so he said that he would research it and give me a call back on Monday, Dec. 2nd.  

So today is Dec 7th and I still haven't gotten a call back from PHYROM.  So I guess his answer to me is \"you're one family and your satisfaction doesn't matter us\".  So my answer back is a BIG MIDDLE FINGER TO YOU AND YOUR RESTAURANT CAUSE I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!!!!  CAUSE ONE BAD REVIEW DOESN'T COUNT when all the others are over 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love asian fusion burgers, e.g., Fukuburger.  It actually reminds me of a burger I had on my honeymoon in the Cook Islands -- hello, egg!   

These are gourmet burgers, so some burgers are slightly more pricey than the average burger at a restaurant.  But it's so worth it!  According to one waitress, the popular burgers tend to be the Ronin burger and Kiki's burger.  I can attest that the Kiki burger is delicious; the ingredients mesh together such that they complement each other (sweet and tangy) and there's no one overwhelming flavor.         

And the fries -- oh, the fries! The burgers don't come with fries, so you gotta order them separately.  The salt and pepper garlic fries are simply a must try.  The fries are shoestring, with cilantro and jalapeños.  Just a great combination of ingredients that results in french fried goodness! And without the need of excessive drenching in sauce.

As a tip, the front entrance to the restaurant is NOT the door facing Windmill.  The place is in a strip mall (surprise, surprise), and there's a walkway and door on the Windmill side.  BUT, the entrance is actually on the other side -- facing inside the strip mall.  

I'm a fan of this place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Whenever my family comes to Las Vegas I always bring them here because I normally get the best service here. But today no. We've been here for an hour & everyone got their order except my dad. & My dad didn't get bis burger till 45 minutes to almost an hour & not wanting it anymore. It's pretty sad being a certified chef & having the manager tell me that it doesn't matter on the cooking temperature that you'll still receive it. If you order a medium rare burger it should be the first one done, not 45 minutes later from a burger that we received that was medium well. So please tell me why his excuse was \"my dad ordered separate\" but he was the one who had ordered first out of the 9 of us. But the manager I believe Mike did everything he could to make my dad happy which was great. Hopefully when my dad comes back from Hawaii we will take him again. It is a really great restaurant, but today's service wasn't really great from the server."}
{"text":"We visited in March 2013.  We had the Kiki, Miyagi, & a meatless burger.  They were all very delicious!!  And thank you Calvin, for the excellent service!!  Lots of parking too!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place before, had to try it when we were in Vegas. It did not disappoint! I ordered Mr.Ho's burger. It was a good mixture, somewhat on the sweet side. The ramen is the best thing ever! Most of the ramen I have had were too salty, I was reluctant to try the ramen. It came out PERFECT!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this place before I went the first time. As a burger lover, anything that sounds foreign makes me think they're just going to screw around with my burger...not here.

Burger was awesome! Cooked well done just the way I like it with a hefty dose of fries on the side. It actually tasted like a homemade grilled burger...if you had a five- star chef manning your bbq. Great service, quiet place so I could actually hear myself think. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so I was really looking forward to eating here.  Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  While the food was good, service was absolutely horrible.  We walked in at about noon on a Tuesday, the atmosphere was nice, but we waited almost 10 minutes just to be seated.  The restaurant was about half full and there were quite a bit of open tables.  No one acknowledged us for a couple of minutes, and when the server did, she just called across the restaurant that she would \"be right with you\" as she continued to do other things.  There were three servers, one obviously was new since he didn't have a clue what was going on, and all three continued to ignore us.  So like fools we stood there waiting.  In hindsight we should have left and gone somewhere else, but we really wanted to eat here.  A party of 7 or 8 arrived after U.S. and left because it took so long just to be seated.  Finally we were seated and it took awhile to get our menus and drink order.  We waited another 15 minutes to order our food.  We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, miyagi burger and the bahn mi burger.  Took a little over half an hour to get our food, but the food was great.  That would have made up for the horrible service had the server not dropped the aioli sauce on the ground causing it to spill on my friends shoe and all over his chair and the ground.  The sauce left an oil stain on his shoe.  At least the server apologized profusely and comped one of his drinks, but I didn't think it was enough.  At that point we were irritated and just wanted to pay and leave.

Food was really good, service was really horrible.  Bachi burger - you need to hire more servers to provide better service!

Definitely not eating at this location ever again!  Hopefully another location can provide better service so we can enjoy the delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is so good!  The burgers are really juicy and the buns are soft, but not in a bad way, in a wonderful pillow-like fluffy way.  The service is nice and the decor is okay.  I had the bahn mi burger and I loved it.  Also the home-made sodas are the bomb!!  I hope we can see more places like Bachi Burger thrive in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We take ALL of our visitors from out-of-state here, no question. And every single person has liked it. This location updated their room to have a bar, too and are open into the late hours, if that's what you want. We've never been here so late before due to our toddler. Doesn't matter, though, we still LOVE it. Be warned. Lunchtime can have a long wait. 
Their  fries are great, but it's their burgers we crave. Kiki's is my husband's go-to order. Mine is the Banh Mi Burger (Vietnamese flair). There's also a Korean type, a Ronin, with a fried egg, Taro bun burger, and a heck of a lot more. You can design your own, too, if you prefer. They've added new appetizers and foreign beers, too. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"First time being here. Heard about it from a friend. Great burgers with amazing taste! Presentation was amazing! Environment was pleasant and relaxing. The prep cook with the Afro did one amazing job. He has an art of what he does!"}
{"text":"If I were to leave this Earth today, I would feel comfortable knowing that I have eaten  the Best Burger around... Awesome! I had the Spicy Miso Burger, my son the Kiki and my wife the Bhan Mi. Don't forget the Parmasean Truffle fries. They also have a great beer selection. When you're in Vegas So Cal people make it a point to come here."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Amazing drinks, great location and atmosphere but horrible service. It takes forever to get youre food or check. The wait staff has been hit or miss. They are either really nice and accomadating or rude. The only reason why we dont come more often is cause of the service."}
{"text":"Pretty Sure, if this place was on the Strip, people would be talking about it nationally.  It's pretty freaking amazing.  It's a small little place, but everything I've ever had here is good.  My favorite sandwich is the lonely bird, which is a mix of chicken and turkey, but they also have edamame seasoned with garlic and truffle oil.  Literally, everything I have had here,  AMAZING.  it's also open until two, so I can get something on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Well, when i was told where we were eating, i was kind of worried, didnt sound like my cup-o-tea.  But i figured, \"hey, its burgers, should be fun.\"  

When we walked in, there was only one table, with two guys at it and the waitress wanted to put us right next to them, at a lil table against the wall.  But as some of us know, \"you dont put RLB in the corner,\" and im a lil claustrophobic, so she moved us to a bigger table and off the wall.

The waitress seemed to be new, maybe just had the training wheels taken off, but she was very polite and was able to answer our questions.

I went with what has been dubbed \"their plain burger.\"  I thought that the meat had a great flavor to it, but what threw it off was the sweet bun that it was on.

The salt & pepper garlic fries were GREAT!!!  They even through in jalepenos(which one snuck up on me.)

All in all, it was a good experience.  3 may be a lil low to many of yall, but our taste buds and what we like, will always be different."}
{"text":"I went with a friend on a Saturday night, so it was packed! We had a 25 wait time outside in the heat standing, but even so this place is amazing! The quality of the food was well worth the wait! I had the Kiki's Burger and I have got to say it was one of the best burgers of my life, if not the best!!!"}
{"text":"The $26 shogun burger had a good presentation. But I would say it didn't worth $26. The oxtail fries was too salty. The service was good though. I would like to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Ate here again today food is always great but they are always short staffed We didn't t get our sweet potato fries til were done with our burgers This food is expensive for this kind of crappy service they need more help to be working"}
{"text":"I ordered the oxtails chili fries based on the multiple rave reviews. Was disappointed in the plate I got! Major flavors were salt and cumin seasoning in the chili gravy. There was not a shred of oxtails that I could see or taste! Could only taste the over powering cumin as if the cook thought he was using black pepper and grabbed the wrong seasoning! Reminded me of canned chili in texture except canned would taste better. Disappointing because I love both home cooked chili and oxtails! The only positive was the egg on top. That was perfectly cooked. 

I also ordered a Ronin burger. Great charred taste to go with the sweet onions and coleslaw on it! The burger buns were fresh as tasted good! Glad for the redemption of the Ronin burger because the $50 round trip taxi fare (Saturday, 3pm, light traffic) from the MGM would hurt if I didn't get at least one good plate of food for all I spent!"}
{"text":"I was expecting horrible food due the noise, fluorescent lighting and sports bar/fusion restaurant atmosphere. How can you relax while you eat with the sights and sounds of being at a sports bar? However, I tried a burger that the waitress recommended and it was great. It turned a two star into a for star. When you're not in a large \"strip\" hotel/casino, you usually get road apples in Vegas. Trust me, you better know where to eat."}
{"text":"Alright place. Had the tonkotsu ramen and the ronin burger. Both were alright. Ramen broth was good at first but kind of too sweet. Burger was too marinated."}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive. The oxtail chili cheese fries are fantastic. Really great.  They are beyond rich, so plan to share. 

That being said everything else was kind of eh. I love a good burger, but the ones we had were both just ok. The menu descriptions sounded really fantastic,  and having seen this place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives I had really high hopes.  We were totally underwhelmed.  Also our server was nice but not incredibly friendly or helpful. Also the couple next to us had some questions about the menu and she was of zero help to them. 

If we could get the fries for take out we might consider it, but otherwise we won't be back."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm? Eh. I've eaten Bachi Burger twice, both were to go orders and it does tend to lose a bit of quality on the drive home. The first time, it was evident that the quality of meat was way better than what most of us are used to. Today, it didn't seem that way. The service was good, no issue there, we got there when they opened which seems to be my thing. I like to avoid the crowd. We ordered the Kiki and Black and Green Burger, we ordered them medium rare. Like most reviews, it was basically well done, a bit dry. It didn't taste bad but there is a difference in taste. And my burger, Black and Green, said it had blue cheese and I don't think it did, it's not a subtle flavor. The app was good, spinach and artichoke dip, we ran out of chips so we used our fries. 

Overall, it wasn't bad, it was ok. The flavors are good and it won't hurt you to check this place out. I'd go again to try the Shogun burger."}
{"text":"Found hair in our crab dip and chips. Told the waiter and he took it away. Then our server said she'll take it off the bill and brought us a new one. Supposedly she said she'll take off 30%. And if we didnt want it then we should have said so. If we did THEN they would have taken it off the bill completely.  WE FOUND HAIR IN THE FOOD. Thats disgusting. As a manager thats pathetic. Our waiter was nice but sorry thats unacceptable."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries are a must. Risotto loco moco is an excellent alternative to a bunned burger."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing but one of the most disrespectful hostesses I've ever encountered. If Erika is the kind of first impression Bachi Burger wants to greet their guests with, we are happy to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the Kiki Burger.. It's okay... Service needs to improve. The servers seem to have early stages of Alzheimer's. They forgot the extra plates, knives, coffee... Lol"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the doors opened. Unfortunately the quality of food and service is going downhill. The last few times I have ordered burgers the buns have been stale and hard. The first time I overlooked it. Things happen. Tonight I ordered the Crusty Crab burgers to go. I waited for them to be prepared then took them home. I live less than five minutes away. Once again the buns were stale and hard. This time I called to complain. The manager on duty said the buns were fine. He offered to replace the buns.. Not remake the sandwiches. That was a horrible remedy for a bed situation. I will never go back again. What a shame!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to visit bachi burger after seeing it on diners, drivers and dives, and we were not disappointed. We started off with some adult milkshakes, which were strong but delicious.

For burgers, we had the bbq burger, the kikis burger, and the miyagi burger. My friend said the bbq was good but nothing spectacular. My husband had the miyagi which was savory with lots of flavors. I had the kiki which was suggested by the waitress, and it lived up to its reputation. It was huge, but I finished every last bite because the burger and dipping sauce were amazing.  In addition to our burgers, we also had the truffle fries which were cut thin and came with a spicy dipping sauce. If we are ever in the area, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The greatest burger I have ever had in my life! Hands down, some of the most creative, delicious food I've ever experienced. Only gripe was the long wait but the food was completely worth it."}
{"text":"Now i see why everytime i come theres new staff, should be a hint to management if u cant maintain staff, If your looking for a family place stay away from here!! I've been here numerous times and this restaurant is very small and you can hear everything that goes on in the kitchen, the language is horrible and the way someone back there talks to there employees is crazy, 'dumbass's, 'f-ing idiots' and slamming stuff around and other customers jump, its nuts in there! These guys need to get there crap together its such a shame cuz the food is ok"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, if a bit expensive for burgers.  But the cocktails are served in glasses that are barely bigger than a shot glass.  I had eaten at the West Sahara location but didn't remember much about the food, but as soon as the waiter set down my drink here I flashed back to the equally small drink I was served at the other location.  For me, the cocktails are as important as the food so I won't be coming back here because of the chintzy drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Christmas Eve, a decent 15-20 min wait. Kiki's burger was delicious. Soft buns and perfect for mushroom lovers. 

However, the pork belly in the pork belly buns were tragically overcooked. To the point that I had trouble cutting it with a knife. The very polite waitress offered to get the manager, who never showed up. We asked again and they took it off the bill. Oxtail chili cheese fries were good.  

All in all, wonderful burgers, okay appetizers. Not the most consistent place."}
{"text":"Delicious! My burger was nicely seated yet very juicy and the duck buns were also very amazing! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So happy our out of town guests recommended this place! All I can say is you need to experience this place for yourself to enjoy the diverse palate of flavors and fusion! Your taste buds will dance with delight. Whether it's their amazing burgers, oxtail chili, or all day breakfast, you cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"On a trip to Vegas a few friends told me about Bachi Burger, I guess they were on DDD. It was a ways out from the strip but worth the drive. I ordered the Wagyu burger , great clean flavors and very soft buns. Ordered it with a beer and side of fries, how can you go wrong. LOL I will go back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent burger place all Angus or Wagyu beef, they have great truffle, and Oxtail chili fries. They also have great daily specials today I had a roasted baby beet salad with watercress, avacado,  topped with a great balsamic  vinegrett dressing. We fished with a fantastic sesonal bread pudding with pecan ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"In a town like Las Vegas where it's very difficult to sift through all of the countless restaurants it's refreshing to find one that has quality, and value. The Miyagison burger is a \"bucket list\" burger. The best in the world."}
{"text":"So we ordered way to much food so we could try everything... And ended up eating all of it. The ronin burger and Oxtail fries were really filling... The duck was the best though :)))))) Order it with the sweet potato fry sauce (idk what it's called but it's orange.) I am so mad it took me so long to find this place! Glad I finally tried it though!"}
{"text":"As always the food was good and creative.  I would have given 5 stars but it is a little slow for me, especially at lunch...  Great food friendly service."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you are ever in Vegas try Bachi Burger!  We had their Mr. Ho's Burger!  Amazing!  Never though I would be eating a taro bun in Vegas.  The restaurant isn't very big; it was a bit on the dirty side, especially the bathroom, and we had to wait a long time.  But the food was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times but idk if I will be coming back mainly because of the oscars...so this is what happened:

My bf and I ask our waiter if he can turn one of the tv to abc so we can watch the Oscars while we eat. The waiter goes n the back and says yes they will change it. So we get our appetizer of oxtail fries and the channel still hasn't changed. 

We basically finish the platter and still haven't seen our waiter 2 remind him about the channel so we flag down another waiter. This waiter says something like we don't change the channel and y would u want 2 watch it with out volume but I will see what we can do.

By this time our burgers come out. I am semi enjoying my Kiki burger when our first waiter approaches. He remembers that he was going 2 change the channel and ask us y the channel hasn't changed. OMG @ this point we just ask for our check and leave.

Idk what the big deal was it was 530 on a Sunday with 3 other people in the restaurant and they were not even facing the tv.

I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"First time here , but the first impression is always the lasting one.  I ordered the Kalbi burger and some salt & pepper fries.  The burger was perfect.  The fries were amazing. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The Mr. Miyagi was a great combination of flavors and textures...plus Karate Kid was just on TV a few days ago!"}
{"text":"Might be best burgers in Vegas. Very good beer selection. Interesting other items on menu as well. Haven't had any service problems yet. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Today I waited a good 10 minutes at the host stand without being acknowledged. Once I was seated the experience got better. If the food wasn't so good I would have left and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was great, but our service was terrible from start to finish. First, our server was inattentive. She didn't give us an attitude but she seemed like her mind was elsewhere. We were just a party of five, but ran out of tea and water regularly. We each ordered fries, but some came as appetizers and some during the meal with no explanation. The extra sauces we ordered with the meal weren't brought to us. We had to ask for them again. To top it off they screwed up the meal ticket. As our party was seated we had asked our server if she could create two tickets. She said, \"yea, no problem.\" At the end of our meal she brought us one ticket, not two. We tried to talk to her, but after five minutes of waiting we couldn't find her. At this point we were fed up with the service and just wanted to leave. Three party members pooled cash for their meals and tip. Our server still nowhere in sight, I walked the check up to the manager and explained that he should put $33 on the card, the rest of our ticket was paid in cash. He delegated it to a man who clearly didn't understand how to operate their payment system. My card was promptly charged the entire $97. A simple apology was offered, no more. I signed the receipt, got the cash back, and left. The next day I had to rush to the bank and deposit the cash so that my insurance bill would clear.

Sure the burgers and fries were great, but the service us five received was terrible. In Vegas if you really want a good burger there are plenty of other places with better food AND service."}
{"text":"Went to Bachi Burger for lunch on Monday, and it was so good, I felt I needed to update my review for them

From when we ordered to getting the food, it was 15 minutes EXACT. Not too bad. It wasen't busy, so I still wonder why a -burger place- has that kinda of slowness in cooking the food. Service is still great, very attentive.

Kiki's Burger is  pure perfection, and it was cooked to a pefect MEDIUM for a change. I was so happy with it! Juicy and very beefy. Gor the truffle parmesian fries, and OMG, they were so wonderful! Hot, frsh and wow..I love truffles I guess now! Got the calamansi lime soda which was very tart and refreshing.

I wish all my trips here were so perfect!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has delicious burgers and the taro milk tea is amazing."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend.  I eat very few burgers, it seems burger-joints are everywhere and many all look and taste the same.   Not so at Baci Burger.  We were seated quickly for a Saturday night.  The wait staff were all friendly and helpful.  My wife and I ordered Angus burgers with various toppings and some sweet potato fries.   I also ordered a draft hard cider.   The food was hot and delicious.  The burgers were not greasy and were done to our liking.  The toppings were fresh, the bacon added just a hint of sweetness.  
The premises was clean and well lit.  We will be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bachi Burger since they first opened on Windmill. My wife and I have always enjoyed perfectly prepared meals and excellent customer service and we absolutely loved the food. Yesterday we took a group of friends from out of town to lunch at Bachi Burger and it was not a good experience. 

We were a group of 12 and had made a reservation for 1 pm. We were seated and had our drink and meal orders in by about 1:20 pm. We were seated on the Ramen side and it appears we were out of sight out, out of mind. We sat for 45 minutes without being even checked on by our waitress. Our fries were brought out at that time. In an hour we were checked on once and had our water filled once. It was at least another 45 minutes before our burgers were brought out. One of the men in our group left without eating because he had been away from work for two hours and had to return. Over two hours passed before we were finally served our food. The food was not up to its usual high standard. The egg on the burgers had hard cooked yolk. It has always been cooked medium with runny yolk which adds to the deliciousness of the burger. I had told everyone in our party how great the food was and it wasn't up to the normal high standards. The service was the worst. When the waitress was asked about the two hour wait for food, she said they can't control the time and gave other excuses. When asked why we were never informed of the extended time to get food she had no answer and was defensive. She did apologize but it was not genuine and I truly believe she didn't care. This is not the standard I have come to expect from Bachi Burger and I am extremely disappointed. Bachi Burger has always been my favorite restaurant and that is how I characterized it to my friends. I feel let down. Our bill was over $200 and there was no consideration given on the bill in spite of the serious issues we experienced. This experience has tarnished my formerly high opinion of Bach Burger and I will seriously question whether I will ever return. Disappointed doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"My bf swears that Bachi Burger was his favorite restaurant on our most recent trip to LV.  Everything we ordered was delicious, the service was great, location not too off the beaten path (easy to find) and decor clean and modern.  Bachi Burger has been added to our \"must eat\" places for LV!

LOCATION
I can't remember correctly, but if you have a smart phone you can just Maps it from the strip and it was only about 10-15 mins away.  Bachi Burger is in a shopping complex with several other businesses, and lots of parking.

FOOD
I was interested in the ramen since I've never seen a burger place sell ramen, and the two tables around us had ordered ramen.  Like literally, the table of 2 next to us both people had ordered ramen, and the table on the other side of us with 4 people they all ordered ramen.  There must be something up with the ramen and I will definitely try it next time.

-Truffle Parmesan Fries: My bf and I are suckers for any kind of truffle fries, and it was sooo good at Bachi.  I ordered it and it came with some kind of brown sauce (was that the truffle??) on top.  I also had mine Sweet potato - so good!

-Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries: My bf had this with his burger, I liked mine better but his was good too.

-Miyagi San burger: I had this, and requested it on salad since I have wheat allergies.  They gave me no problem and put it on a nice bed of veggies.  Yum!  I really liked the teri sauce, the furikake, bacon and fried egg on top of a juicy wagyu patty.  The onion rings I just ate on the side haha.

-Kalbi burger: Bf had this, said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  And he's a burger guy so I take his word on it lol."}
{"text":"Like a lot of reviewers, I saw this place on Triple D and went to check it out. Perhaps I am not the person that should review a gourmet burger place, considering I am quite content with a basic burger, but this place was pretty good. I did not know what half of the ingredients were (hence my statement earlier), but that is not a bad thing. I got a speciatly burger (featured on Triple D), which had pork on it. It was good, but I would have preferred to eat the burger my GF got (a basic bacon cheeseburger). Fries were very good."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a mean burger. Their ingredients are paired so well and everything is delicious! 

They're a bit pricey but it's worth it every once in a while. I ordered the Kiki burger, and will definitely be getting it again."}
{"text":"I love the unique twists this restaurant brings to burgers. I've tried almost 5 different choices now, and am thinking my favorite is the Spicy Miso burger. They are all so different, its hard to even describe to someone what they might like. I recommend you come here with a bunch of people and everyone takes a small slice of each burger :)

The french fries are awesome as well, nice and crispy with a few different flavor selections, all are good. 

Nice staff as well, always have had a pleasant experience here."}
{"text":"We were at the Windmill barchi a month ago. Oxtail chile fries were much better than  here. There was no oxtail at all, it was just chili.  Service was not good either. The service was slow being nobody is there. But at lease the burger was good."}
{"text":"Say this place on Triple D, everything looked great, so I knew I would have to try it the next time I was in Vegas. Was passing through over Spring Break and talked my wife into stopping in. Bad mistake. 
Arrived around 5:30pm and about half the tables were seated. Had to wait 20 minutes to get a table anyway. The waiter was new and couldn't answer any questions about the menu. When we tried to ask another server, they refused to help, then went and sent our guy back to the table. It kind of became our joke for the night. We ordered beers from a so-so beer list, and they were out of that beer, ordered a different beer, out of it too. And then again. Finally asked the waiter to tell us what beers they did have, and it was only about half of the list. All of the interesting Japanese beers were not available. The rest was generic micro brews like Sam Adams, Stone Brewery, and Rouge, which they didn't have.
Then we ordered dinner, a Kiki Burger MR, the Chili Chicken and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The burger was barely cooked, maybe blood rare, but I ate it anyway. It was actually pretty good. I tried the Wagu beef to see if it really was better. It was tasty, but probably not worth the extra money. 
The fries were bland and tasteless at best. Wouldn't order them again. Parmesan and Black Truffle are such great flavors, it seemed like it would be a can't miss. Oh well, should have gone for the Oxtail Chili Fires.
The waiter showed up about 10 minutes after putting our order in to tell us they were out of the Chili Chicken. Seems like pretty bad management to be out of half the beers on the list and multiple products on the menu. We ordered some Ramen after 10 minutes of trying to get the waiter to explain some of the ingredients. He was no help so we chose one on a whim. Turned out to be alright, but like the fries, not something I would come back for. The under cooked burger turned out to be the high light of the meal. 
I was so hoping for an amazing burger and all round good meal, but it wasn't to be this time. I might try the place in Pasadena, but there are so many better burger places in the LA area that I can't see wasting a trip to relive this experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday for dinner at around 6:30...it took half an hour to 40 minutes just to receive the Salt and Pepper fries...it took another Half to get our burger.  I got the Kiki Burger and my other half got the Kalibi Burger.  

There wasn't too many people at the restaurant but I think they were understaffed?  We had our waiter stop by and apologize for the service and that it will take a few minutes for our food.  Good thing is they did comp us another set of Salt and Pepper fries for the wait...although the second batch wasn't as tasty as the first.  They had more cilantro in the second batch than they did in the first.

Kiki Burger - it was okay.  Nothing really too good about it but nothing bad either.  I tried it for the mushroom, I was in a mushroom mood.  I did like the kimchi from the Kalbi Burger (it was served on the side in a little dish).  I didn't get to try that burger.

Overall the food was okay, was told the one on Windmill is better.  Wouldn't come back only because the service took forever...an hour to wait for food is a little much, they did apologize, and I'm sure it's an \"off\" day...

OH also tried their Lychee Milk Tea.  Not the greatest...more like Milk Tea than Lychee."}
{"text":"During my recent business trip to Vegas, Bachi Burger was BY FAR the best meal that I enjoyed!  Arriving during the prime dinner period, my friend and I immediately noticed the good amount of people waiting to be seated.  Note: they do not take reservations.  Our party of 2 put our name in and sat down, fully expecting to wait the 30 minutes that we were told by the hostess.  Shockingly, within 5 minutes we were called up and seated; sometimes being just a party of 2 helps a lot!  I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, which came topped with chili mayo, a fried egg, furikake, 
caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings, as well as their salt & pepper garlic French fries, with a side of pineapple ketchup.  From the first delectable bite to the last, this meal was fantastic.  The burger was prepared perfectly and every bite was FULL (FULL!) of flavor.  The fries were great and the pineapple ketchup was sublime.  I enjoyed three burgers during this recent Vegas trip (Bachi, Fukuburger, and BurGR) and this meal was by far the best!  The two locations are off of the Strip, but do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was full when we arrived. There was a 20-minute wait, which did not seem long as the turnover was fast. 

Service was fast and on-point. The food came out surprisingly fast.

Both the Apple Lychee* and Crispin are crisp and refreshing.

Bachi Pickles* - Absolutely delightful and opens up your appetite. The garlic and daikon are my favorites, but honestly it was all delicious. This was one of the best kimchi I have ever had. This appetizer pairs well with Cherry Yuzu Soda*.

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries* - The table next to us all turned around to look at this appetizer and asked us if it was good. The answer is YES. Very flavorful. Fries are done right. The portion is huge. The jalapeno and beans go hand in hand  with the fries. The fried egg is visually appealing and a wonderful idea. 

Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausages* - Another great appetizer. Love the bite and snap of the sausage. It was a shame that the sausages came out warm as it would have tasted even better if the temperature was hotter. The whole grain honey mustard was a genius match. I would suggest trying one of the Bachi Pickles with a sausage dipped with a little bit of the whole grain honey mustard.

Before going into the burgers, I must note that the buns are Taiwanese-style sweet bread that is baked daily (as so the menu says). I love these buns and they are baked to a beautiful golden brown. 

Kiki's Burger - The garlic chili aioli brought out the mushrooms, it was a wonderful pair. You can see a lot of thought put into creating this burger.

Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - I love all of the elements of this burger, however, the burger was not as amazing as I thought it would be with everything together. It was hyped up too much by the name. All in all, this is still a great burger.

On a different occasion, I had:

Iced Vietnamese Coffee - Was not impressive, have had better before.

Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries - Bland, not anything new or special. The sauce  on the side was only okay.

\"Banh-Mi\" Burger* - This is truly a scrumptious burger. The nuoc mam sauce on the side tasted heavenly with the burger. 

* = You must order this"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place. I mean what more could you do with a burger?! Was not disappointed at all!!! Wide selection of burgers and ramen as well. 

Had the miyagi burger. YUM. 
Oxtail fries. YUM. 
Tan Tan. YUM. 

You won't be disappointed! There's something for everyone! Wish I had ate here more! And I wish there was one in hawaii!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time there the fries were recooked with a bottle of salt and the veggie burger fell apart....35 dollars later for two no thank you my last time"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. This place puts a completely different outlook on how a burger is made. I believe the Origin is Japanese. However, they are amazing at making burgers. Must go!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and it was a great visit! I had the Kiki Burger and my boyfriend had the classic burger with cheddar, and we both split the hot crab dip. Everything was delicious and the service was timed perfectly. Hats off to our server Taylor for also going above and beyond to adjust the temperature of the dining room for us. Greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"Tried three times, each time worse. This staff is bizarre and remain completely unaffected by their clientele. When only five tables occupied it took me over 50 minutes to get a burger and then it was wrong. Each time I have gone it has been to see it improve but instead it just diminishes. Their menu is limited, some items not even available. They seem insulted when you don't want their magic aioli curry concoction or ask to change what is on their menu as they overdue everything on it. Overpriced, sorry staff, and marginal food. Better bet Wendy's or even the burgers at Black Bear Diner a few blocks away, at half the price and they don't mind making it the way you want.
Sorry but three times a charm and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Teresa was freaking amazing made excellent selections for us to try sonce my friend had never been here before. She explained the menu amazingly! I have been to the other location but will only come here new just because if her. Thx Teresa"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this for a while and glad we did. Let me just start by saying that this is quality at an affordable price. We started by ordering the oxtail chili cheese fries...amaaaazing! Best fries I've ever had...a little sweet with a nice kick of spice. We then shared the black and green burger and the Miyagi San burger. The quality of the beef was amazing and the burgers were cooked to perfection. Service was very helpful in recommending things to us. This will become a regular spot for us when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Only been here a couple of times due to a busy life but I would recommend this place first when it comes to an INCREDIBLE burger! Moist and succulent Wagyu beef with a fried egg and crispy onion rings on the Miyagi-San burger is just an intro to the palate. The Japanese BBQ sauce and aioli kick it out if this world! On top of all of that I got the truffle fries and now I think my burger life is ruined cause I don't want any old burger from any where else! These Truffle Fries are the BOMB! Served with a sun dried tomato aioli and drizzled with a truffle sauce and Parmesan cheese-really?! Holy freaking shazbot!! Service here is excellent(attentive, friendly, courteous)! Summer time at this restaurant is going to be busy so get here now and enjoy before the crowds invade!! I'll try the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've only had the Kiki's burger and the truffle parmesan fries but it was absolutely delicious. The service is professional, the waiters were friendly, and the decor was clean and simple. The price is very affordable as well -- you will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"I was so beyond excited to try this place for the first time. When we got there we were served water but after 25 minutes no one had come to get our drink order let alone greet us. And when we asked for a waiter an employee seemed annoyed with us. The service was just all around horrible"}
{"text":"This place is highly overated. I ordered their famous kiki burger and was very dissapointed it was a undercooked patty smothered with sauce and other condiments.  I ordered the truffle frys and was further dissapointed. I would not come again based on low quality and that they are heavily over priced. I appreciate qulaity and good flavor reflecting such, therefore I would suggest going anywhere else for a burger....."}
{"text":"One thing for sure is, their burgers are big and juicy! I got an egg with mine which was so good! At first I was skeptical about this place because it was something different, but you know what they say...don't knock it till you try it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a regular american burger and bun your not going to find it here. If you like American/Asian fusion and you`re not afraid to put out a little $$$, this is the place for you. The wait can be a little long if you go on a weekend night but the food is excellent and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. The portions are not very big but that is typical for Asian cuisine. I will be eating here again and again!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. Every time I visit I get a different burger and they have all been excellent."}
{"text":"I no longer understand why my friends and I bothered to stand and wait 40 minutes for these overpriced burgers, but I do know that I will never do it again.  The burgers may be good but no amount of good food can make up for the stupid long waits and terrible service.  Today after waiting 40 minutes we watched as our table was given away to a group that had just arrived.  The hostess was indifferent to the fact that we had been waiting and this was the last straw.

Don't waste your time waiting to pay $15+ for a burger only marginally better than the DairyQueen across the parking lot (my friends and I now call DQ \"Bachi Burger East\")."}
{"text":"For years, every time I have read any kind of poll for burgers in Las Vegas, Bachi Burger is at or near the top. We finally tried it and were not particularly impressed. Don't get me wrong, the burger was quite good and tasty but not $16 tasty. This place is what I call a \"hipster foo-foo\" restaurant...they cater to those who want their kind of atmosphere. That's fine but we look for good taste and quality food. My wife had a $9 appetizer which consisted of two meatballs so our total bill for a hamburger, fries, and two meatballs (no drinks), was $34. 

My wife's meatballs were tasty but without all the kale and other unknown, inedible stuff they used for garnish artistically placed on the plate, they would have looked quite plain. I asked if they made their own fries and the waiter said they do but that was not true. I was given a frozen product which was pretty good for what it was but I do not like it when a restaurant brags about it's homemade food then give me French fries they bought frozen in a bag. 

It was also VERY loud...there were people yelling and whooping it up the entire time we were there so we couldn't speak to each other. 

In short, we found Bachi Burger to be quite overrated. If  atmosphere is more important than the food and you are a \"hipster dude\", this may be the place for you. Otherwise, you're better off spending $10 at Five Guys or even $5 at In-N-Out and just having a good hamburger."}
{"text":"Some the most creative burgers I've ever seen. Probably the best burger I've ever had. 

They also had great deserts and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best burger I have ever had. Highly suggest the burger with an egg, coleslaw and kalbi Bbq sauce! The buns are crazy soft and delicious, meat is always cooked perfectly. No complaints here, this place is legit."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. I always see this place and though not a burger fan, I got curious. So we decided to come here and the 20 minute wait on a Friday night is definitely worth it. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries for our appetizer and it's gone in less than a minute. Oh so yummy. Everyone ordered a different burger and they said it is absolutely good. I ordered the most expensive burger which is still priced reasonably for $25. It is called shogun burger. With foie gras (goose liver)  unagi (eel) and some pears. It is the best burger ever! I ordered it well done since I can't risk taking any raw meat, I'm 6 months pregnant. It still came out sumptuous and juicy. We all shared a red velvet milkshake for dessert since all of us are full already. It was definitely worth the wait and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My little brother and I went here randomly the other day for lunch, I had been meaning to do so for a few months now. We walked in to a quaint restaurant with an adorable vibe. We were seated and instantly greeted with water and started off our meal with \"Bachi pickles\" which, at the time, I wasn't sure what they were. I also had a nuclear green, green tea and my brother had strawberry lemonade. The \"Bachi pickles\" was an assortment of pickled things, like garlic, beet, and peppers. So delicious!
   For my entree I ordered the special spare rib sandwich, it was delicious! It was super tender considering spare ribs can be tough and weren't as fatty as I had expected, which is fine by me! My brother enjoyed a Ronin burger which was massive, he only ate half, that never happens! We shared a side of sweet potato fries, fried to perfection and sprinkled with salt. They were served with a sauce I can't remember the name of but it was super lemony, if you will, that I devoured.

  Ericka was our server and she was super attentive and sweet. She never left our water glasses unattended and always made sure we were perfectly content. We will be back!"}
{"text":"did to go order this evening and they repeated the entire order back to me over the phone which was nice. something odd was they took cc # but i suppose they might have a lot of ppl order togo and not pick it up. windmill location doesnt do that which is quite funny. different clientele perhaps. order was ready when they said it was since i arrived 25 mins after phone call and they quoted 30 mins. food was amazing as always got the kalbi burger and ronin both amazing. dont like kim chee so i substituted japanese coleslaw for it and it turned out good. caesar salad had amazing flavors and i love avocados so nice touch with that in the salad. only downfall was i ordered the parmesean truffle fries and they made salt and pepper fries with ginger on them. i called the restaurant to notify them that someone elses order might be mixed up and they apologized and could tell it was sincere the gentleman asked if they could do anything to make it up. but not a big deal in my eyes. fries were still good just took ginger off. no truffle or parmesan so looking forward to them next time. always a good choice when looking for a burger. side note they label everything when you do a to go order such as caesar dressing, for fries, for ronin, etc. great touch. deserved a little extra tip, being as i did to go orders back in the day i always tip on to go orders. even a $1 or $2 for a cheap meal makes the service staff smile. at least it made me smile."}
{"text":"I am always coming back here! I crave it and it's by far my favorite place to eat! Fried egg on your burger is a MUST! Doesn't taste the same without it! Great atmosphere and it feels good to be back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The shogun burger is freakin incredible!  Wagyu beef mixed with unagi then topped off with foie gras, marinated pears and spinach. Chili cheese fries with the egg are great too.  Food takes a little long to come out but worth the wait.  Good service."}
{"text":"So yummy. The quality of the food is great. The place is cute. Not to big. They wouldn't let me change the cheese on the pre fixed burger but you could always get a make your own."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place,  I really did, ive seen lots of reviews so I came and was excited to try. Im a big fan of burgers but this place disappointed me in every aspect. 

We order three burgers so we could try, the pork belly bun, and the fries with gravy I forget its  name. We tried three different burgers all medium rare and they all came well. It was a total disappointment, I would have asked to have for it to me remade if the waiter did not look so pre occupied (ill get more to that later). I forget the names now but all the burger were dry dry dry and some of the flavors we surprising not in a good way. I love pork belly buns but these buns were sub par. The flavors didnt stand out anf not memorable at all.

Now let me get to the service. 

They seated us really quickly which was great since they had only six tables occupied, one large table which was already eating when we were sat. It took them a while to take our order, get our drinks.  When the food came, the waiter disappeared, from our table I mean. The food came and it looked epic which made the disapoointment greater. I had to ask him for ketchup and share plates.  But then he left for awhile and I wanted to ask for utensil but he didnt come back until we were ready to leave. I didnt understand why the service was so poor when they looked like they had more than ample staff walking around, just not near our table. They didnt refill our waters and while we were eating, some lady in the kitchen was yelling or talking quite loud. Really unprofessional.  

Will not be back"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants!  The burger quality is perfect.  I usually go for well done because I don't like ANY pink but when I come to Bachi I make sure I order it medium rare because the flavor is SO much better.  The service here is quite slow and often times they have forgotten an item we ordered but to me its absolutely worth the wait.  We always get the garlic chili edamame, truffle fries and salt and vinegar fries.   We also love the Oxtail fries but really recommend to buy it when you're with a bigger group since it is  A LOT of food.   ENJOY!  :D"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice with my wife, after hearing from my friend how great it was.   The first time we were there, we ordered as main course the Veggie burger, Ronin burger, and Sweet potato fries.  The veggie burger was ok.  The Ronin burger on the other hand was delicious. It has so many flavors.  It contains a cross between american and asian ingridients. Also, the sweet potato fries are as good as they get. Lightly salted and crispy. So the second time around we stuck to  Ronin Burgers and sweet potato fries.  

As far as service, service was great.  We were seated immediately. A glass of Iced water is served right away and our food was ready in 10-15 mins.  I have been there during the week either on a Tuesday or Wednesday and there are always many empty tables. I have read other reviews where they mention how crowded it gets.  So I would recommend to go there during the week in the evening preferably.  

All in all, I will be going back soon to try some of their other fries which I hear are amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my top 3 burger places ever. I haven't had anything here I haven't liked. The service is always fast and excellent. You definitely get your money's worth. The burgers are fantastic and range from mild to spicy. The beef is juicy and never over cooked. Their sweet potato fries are heavenly and so are the truffle fries. Thankfully, there is a jogging trail close to my home cause running that trail is a must after eating here, but it's soooo worth it. =)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have heard a lot of people talk about Bachi Burger. We are always looking for a new place to try out. I guess you can say that finding new places to eat is our common interest. Bachi Burger is a burger restaurant with an Asian fusion taste. They offer all the milk shakes burgers (of course) sandwiches and also salads all with an Asian spin to it. Once I found out about this place I had to find out a little more. 
I went onto their website and I must say that it was horrible. I don't know if their web designer decided to stop working on it or maybe they don't know about this issue. The web page does nothing but play music. You are unable to enter anything on their web page. I wasn't able to look at their menu, but we still decided to try it out.  Once we got to the restaurant (Sahara location) there hostess was a young lady who seemed to enjoy her job. She sat us down right away; a man gave us a glass of water but didn't say much, which made it a little weird. Finally after waiting, which wasn't very long by the way, our waiter came to get our drink order. She was very friendly but never introduced herself, which to me I like to know who I'm speaking too. Everything was great food was amazing and the meat was cooked just who we order it, a lot of places don't cook the burger just right. Our waiter came around and checked on us, and always kept our drinks full. When we got our check, we were never told that the lemonade that my boyfriend orders was not free refills, or else when she came around to refill we would have thought twice about or intake on the beverages.  We got charged for 2 lemonades at $4.50 each almost $10 for lemonade that's a little crazy if you ask me. Over all everything was great. 
I would recommend this place to all my friends and family, they have a great staff that is friendly and honestly one of the best burgers I have had. Just make sure that you see if your drinks are free refills or not, most other places let you know if there is a charge for another drink."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Miso burger and DAMN, its good. Seriously, its good. Lorin, the chef/owner, is cooking food with fine dining technique at casual dining prices. You can't go wrong with anything you order there. And the beer and sake selection is really well thought out. The desserts are pretty killer too!"}
{"text":"Didn't know how I felt about oxtail til I came here! Everything I've had is GREAT. Would have given the 5 stars if the staff were a little more friendly with my gazillion questions!"}
{"text":"My favorite new burger place in Vegas.  I had the Miyagi and my wife had the Ronin, both were fantastic.  The onion rings and parmesan fries were wonderful as well.  Service was good and our drinks were refilled promptly.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim because it was open and I was hungry, and so glad I did! Super refreshing kale salad, great tasting lamb burger (it's sweet, so be aware!) and the BEST fries I've ever had, anywhere, hands down. When I visit Vegas again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok after a lot of ranting and raving from other people, we decided to try Bachi Burger. I understand that they are trying to be creative with their Asian fused food. Great concept, however, some times a little too much can be a bad thing. Overall the place was ok but not what I was expecting. I suggest this place if you want a nice atmosphere and finger foods, not if you're terribly hungry or if you have several mouths to feed since everything is a la carte. If on a budget, stick to Fukuburger.

First comment- nice interior and atmosphere. Steady flow of people. Employees were nice. Even though there were other patrons, we seemed to wait a long time for our food. I believe we waited at least 20 mins to get our food and another 15 mins for the check. I mean for a burger this seems like a long time plus there seemed to be a quite a few employees in the back that it shouldn't have taken this long. 

Second - the food. We ordered the parm fries, Ronin burger and Short rib steam buns. Parm fries were good however I didn't feel that the sun-dried tomato aioli really fit in with the fries. If anything I would suggest that the truffle sauce replace the aioli because the sauces didn't go well in my opinion. Also I didn't think the aioli had much flavor considering it was sun-dried tomato. 

The Ronin was just ok. First I'm surprised they didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked. It came out medium well and honestly I would have preferred it a little more pink. First off, the burger in my opinion is quite small and tries to compensate with a thick patty but still looked delicious that I couldn't wait to take a bite. First bite, bread is soft and great quality of meat but the sauce tends to overpower the flavor of the rest of the ingredients. If you asked me I wouldn't have been able to tell you that there was Japanese Cole Slaw, an egg, caramelized onions or a miso dressing, all I could taste was the katsu sauce. There were 2 sauces on the burger and a citrus aioli on the side. Personally I don't think the aioli or the miso dressing are needed since the katsu sauce is powerful enough by itself.

Short rib steam buns - great presentation making it look like pitas. However, first impression was that's alot of dough for the little bit of ingredients within it. First bite is exactly what happened. I thought that the short rib and the egg didn't have enough flavor to overshadow the thickness of the dough. I could taste the cliantro but other than that, I thought the flavor was very bland. I tried the dipping sauce which was suppose to be a horseradish aioli. Personally I wasn't a fan of it, I would have preferred something with a little more zing like a wasabi ranch dressing or a japanese style salsa. It's a great concept but I think it should be revamped to bring out the flavors of the ingredients they try to fuse together or else again everything gets lost in what is trying to be accomplished.

Finally we ordered the Portguese doughnuts. Eh it was just an oversprinkled cinnamon mini-doughnut with a mini vanilla ice cream scoop. It tasted a little burnt and seems to be covered with alot of cinnamon and brown sugar to hide the burnt taste. 

Overall Bachi was just ok, it didn't meet the expectations that I had or maybe I had too high expectations. For two people we spent over $40 and still left hungry so I wouldn't recommend this place if you are starving. Again I like the concept and what they are trying to achieve but for the price I can get the same thing at Fukuburger."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets!

If you want to treat yourself to some amazing handcrafted original burgers, please check out this place.

The decor is excellent, and the food will just blow your mind.

My favorite burger is the Ronin burger, it has an asian slaw, fried egg and other toppings that just meld into one delicious experience.  They use egg buns that they toast just a little to get that delicious crunch, then you can pair that with the softness of the burger.  If I remember correctly, they cook their burgers medium, I usually get mine med-well, but I trusted the chefs to know how to cook their meat, and I wasn't disappointed.  This is not your run of the mill burger, its a taste all of its own.

You can get orders of different types of fries, each come with their own dipping sauce.  They even have a few different types of edimame (sorry sp)."}
{"text":"Little gem away from the strip. 
Very creative and mouth watering burgers. Ok, the fries are amazing too.  We got the truffle fries and the chili fries.  Both are super tasty. The black and green burger,  the Kiki burger and the regular bacon cheese burger were out of this world!  The blending of the flavors and the quality of the craftsmanship elevated these burgers to a new high. I'm not even done with lunch that I'm completing this review. Amazing experience and absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"I really like their food, but service quality is getting worse. I and my friend visited on Wednesday at 8pm. We were standing more than 10 minutes to put our name on the waitlist. Once we seated, we also need to wait more than 15 minutes to order our drinks. They were not like this before, but I don't know why their service is getting worse."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday Night with a group of 12, the staff was over whelmed and uninviting.   Service staff was slow and not personable, waiter seemed as though he was bothered we came in.  Food was good but experience overall was bad due to the wait staff.  Unwilling to remove food from bill when items were not as ordered.  No manager available, and condensation leaking from A/C on to tables and guests.   Will not revisit this location but will try others for the food and a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service. Unbelievable oxtail fries.  Banh Mi burger is fab.  If your here in Vegas get off the strip and come to a locals favorite.   

Locally family owned and service was great"}
{"text":"this place is delicious and the staff is great! the ox tail chili cheese fries were delicious. i didn't think i would like it that much but i couldn't stop eating it! i also tried a kiki burger which was juicy and flavorful. i had a bite of my friends pork belly buns and they were great also. it was full of flavor. 

so far, everything i've tried has been delicious and i will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"So we ordered the pork belly buns & they were amazing. We also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries & those were good I expected them to be a little bit better though especially the way people were talking about it.  My friend & I both ordered the Kiki burger & that was okay nothing spectacular about it. What I likes least about it was the service it sucked ass. They weren't attentive at all & every time we had a question or needed something it felt like we were asking for too much by the way our server responded/looked at us.  Overall it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best hopefully next time it will be better."}
{"text":"We have made another fan of Bachi Burger. One bite and they are sold. Service has been really great. This place can't be missed."}
{"text":"When the burgers are this good, nothing else really matters. Not the ambience, not the service -- which, to be fair, were both perfectly fine in my book though I've read some criticisms. The dining area is small and crowded so there may be a wait during peak hours. And this isn't your run-of-the-mill burger joint so the prices are higher. That being said, whoever came up with these delicious burgers infused with Asian ingredients certainly knows what they're doing. 

This was my first time so I went big. Really big. Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13) is a tower of burger perfection, much as the other options I saw pass our table appeared to be. The toppings on this one are chili mayo, fried egg, furikake (a Japanese condiment that includes sesame seeds), caramelized bacon, and onion rings that are lightly breaded and crisp. All in all, one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Saw it on food network and had to try this place. Had the banh mi burger a couple of weeks ago. Everything was good but the bun was really soggy."}
{"text":"Excellent ! Always a joy.. I wouldn't give it the 5th star due to the long wait and odd seating"}
{"text":"Love love love. I always want to try everything and so it can add up but it's great when you know you want a burger with some Asian plates and flava!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for the very first time. My husband had been talking about this place for about a year now and we finally got a chance to go. When we arrived we were told that the wait was about 25-30 minutes for a party of 5. The hostess said we could go to their new location where the place is bigger and no wait time. However, the new location is 15 miles away. We opted to stay and wait. We sat at the bar and placed our drink order. So glad we did because before we even got our drinks, our table was ready!  

The food is out of control with the perfect portions. Our server was awesome. He was very friendly and answered all of our questions. We ordered the sweet potato and Truffle Parmesan fries as appetizers. We were starving.

I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns -- so flipping tasty. I found them to be better without the sauce. My sister-in-law had the same thing. She seemed to like the sandwich with the sauce.

My husband had the Ronin burger -- delicious is an under statement. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Out of control....

My niece and cousin had the Spicy Miso Burger -- they each  devoured their burger and couldn't stop making comments about how delicious it was.

We all shared the oxtail chili cheese fries...wowwww....explosive flavor in your mouth. You must try these chili fries!!!

The over all experience was fantastic. We're definitely going back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"[No Bachi for coming here]

T-Shirt wearing tenders are all you need to understand what the scene is in here. It's burgers - and no need to explain the \"Bachi\" part - only that my thought is its in mixing the 2 cultures ingredients that someone may receive negative results - well by the attendance, and the amount of conversation in the air, it seems like its the reverse psychological side.

As a burger lover, you wont find cheddar, definitely not American, and hardley a sign there is a simple beef and cheese combo to be had (although you have the option of constructing your own), but you didnt come here for that anyway. I ordered the Black and Green - this is about the closest youll find to anything not too fusion-i. Their take on Wagyu Kobe Beef, naturally grass fed - open range assumed, but not Wagyu American or Japanese as stated on the front, grilled to your temp, Blue cheese crumbles, spinach, and bacon. There were some other things in there but it wasnt noticeable to note.

Burger is substantial, and to remind you this is Vegas casual, but still upscale, they give you a knife that will not only split your burger, but would probably cut through that ceramic dish they serve it on. I opted for the hands on approach, as I do. Burger is very well done (not the cooking temp, by the way of the flag atop my bun) smooth meat to cut, the quarter pound of weight measure, and was preformed, likely in a cylindrical press as I felt the tight packing, but the slightly flakey outter edge - not to be confused with a frozen pre form that is like eating a freshly sliced sausage.

All the other ingredients really melted into the background. What you actually find is that you can smell this beef, an aromatic experience I've found is reserved for the CAB versions - this is probably a hint you maybe in Kansas of experiences, where the beef is free, and the taste is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and presentation, great service, great atmosphere always clean. my third visit there every one is positive. I love latest rammen addition to the menu and sapporo on tap. One of my favs in town. Must try."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, fries & Asian food, you should eat at Bachi Burger the next time you visit LV.

No, these aren't your your typical crappy patties with some kim chee slapped on. These are some seriously tasty, gourmet quality burgers prepared with an Asian twist.

Their menu is simple & highlighted by specialty Japanese, Korean & Vietnamese style burgers, as well as American style signature Kobe & Wagyu beef burgers. There are some Chinese inspired steamed bun sandwiches too.

Truffle Parmesan Fries $4 - Ohhh-MG! These fries were epic! Parmesan Cheese on hot crispy fries, drizzled with a Black Truffle Porcini Cream & served with a Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce. The orders are enough for two, but at only $4, I suggest ordering everyone their own. We were going to try the Sweet Potato Fries, but unanimously decided on more of the same. Needless to say, we ordered more (& more).

Kiki's Burger $8.50 - Shitake, Enoki & Eryngi Mushrooms, sweet onion spread, caramelized bacon, melted Gruyere Cheese & garlic chili aioli dressing. The flavors of the bacon, onion & dressing, combine to make this a tasty & unique mushroom burger.

Kalbi Burger $8 - garlic, Ginger & chili paste, green onions, Korean seasoned mayo & house-made Kim chee on a burger of beef & pork. The kim chee on this burger gave it a major \"wow\" factor. Out of all the tasty burgers here, call me simple, but this was my favorite.

Ronin Burger $8.50 - Japanese cole slaw, caramelized onions, miso dressing, fried egg, Katsu & Yuzu citrus aioli sauce top this mega-sized & flavored, satisfying burger. A close second-favorite for me.

BBQ Bachi Burger 7 oz. Angus Beef $7 - served with lettuce, tomato & onion, but ordered plain for my 9 year old. This thing was huge! But it must've been good 'cause he ate the whole thing & some fries too!

\"Ban-Mi\" Burger $8.50 - Pork, shrimp, lemongrass, curry aioli dressing, slivers of carrot & radish, pickled veggies, Chinese parsley & Nuoc Mam sauce top this wondrously flavored, Vietnamese inspired burger. This burger, with fresh herbs & flavors of pork & shrimp, really kicks Ba-Le Sandwich's butt!

Aside from water, we ordered the Jasmine Strawberry Lemonade, after a server mentioned that they had just made a fresh batch. The strawberry & lemon tasted really fresh & so good.

The service here was good. The servers were attentive & helpful. It took a little while (maybe not-so attentive) for someone to seat us (at an empty table that we were standing next to), but that was soon forgotten, once the fries were served. 

Now one of our favorite LV restaurants, we'll surely be back to try the rest of the menu (& maybe the other fries too)."}
{"text":"Let me just start this review out by saying I love burgers.  Although I enjoy eating salads and tons of veggies I can usually create a reason to go grab a burger at least once a week.  That being said when the opportunity to grab a burger people rave about pops up, I jump on it.  Now I don't want you to get the impression that I'm a burger snob, or a connoisseur of fine burgers.  I just love a great tasting burger that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
Bachi Burger is that and a little more.  What sets this burger apart from other burger joints is its japaneezy flair. Each burger has a good amount of japanese zing that really differentiates itself from its all American counterparts.  One thing I would like to say is that usually when a restaurant decides to do a fusion/mashup theme there is a tendency to lose the first element in favor of the second.  For example it would be easy for a japanese fusion burger place to lose what makes a burger special so that they can cram in the japanese element.  A lot of times I've tried these fusion places only to find that they are only blending things together to be hip and cool not for flavor reasons.  I'm glad to say that when you bite into a Bachi Burger the japanese element is not overdone and you still get what makes a good burger a good burger.  
I usually get the Ronin or the Kiki burger, as the first one has an egg (yes yes yes) and the second has my favorite ingredient (a ton of mushrooms).  Both burgers are great and are examples of fusion food done right.  All the elements of the Ronin blend together nicely and taste like a perfect balance of america and japanese cuisine, kind of like if the Fat Burger and Hamada's had a food baby.  The Kiki burger I feel was made for me  it has three kinds of japanese mushrooms Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki, and Eryngii Mushrooms (what! yes please).  Enoki mushrooms are a really under utilized mushroom and they are great!  I've been waiting for somebody to put them on a burger for a long time.  In fact if you put anything with Enoki mushrooms in front of me I will plow through it like a mad animal.  
Bottom line if you're looking for a fusion restaurant that is about taste and not about gimmicks this is a great place.  The only reason I'm going to give them a four star rating is because when they used to be the only japanese fusion burger on the block they were the the top.  Now, however, I think that they have lost their crown to Fuku Burger both in terms of price and taste.  This might seem harsh, but I don't think you can ignore the fact that Fuku Burger came out swinging, and took the title of best japanese fusion burger away from Bachi.  Does this mean that you should go to Bachi Burger for your burger needs.... NO!! it's a damn fine burger, but it's like that 80's movie highlander taught us \"there can be only one\"."}
{"text":"Things have not changed!  Yay!  Popped in for dinner after about a year from my last visit."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading all the reviews, boy was i wrong!!

I live in Orange County, was in town decided go out the way to this place instead of eating the overpriced food in the hotel.  Low and behold it's definitely overpriced for not so great food.  I'm not a food snob, but I'd like to think I know what great food tastes like. 

Oxtail chili fries (what oxtail??) - can't taste the Oxtail and the chili itself is somewhat odd tasting left like a sour after taste. 2 stars 

Duck Steamed buns - nice presentation, but duck was cooked a bit rare and so tough that you can't even take a bite without pulling all the meats off.  I've had better...I told the server and he was nice enough to it take off the bill. 1 star

Miso Burger - I thought it tasted pretty good, flavors all work together. 3.5 stars

Shogun Burger - Of course the server recommended this burger, it's the most expensive burger on the menu $25.  First off all if you don't know what Unagi is it's (eel) not everyone is familiar with the term.  My son who I think is a food snob wanted to try it, I only noticed it had Foie Gras.  Since it's illegal to eat Foie Gras in California, I thought we're in for a treat.  Let me tell you this burger combination is terrible...It has eel, Foie Gras, Pear, and beef, how does all this come together???!! Fish, beef, duck and pear in a bite is so weird and it left a fishy after taste, totally not what we expected.  

At the end the meal for 3 people cost $70 that's we 3 drinks and with the steamed duck buns taken off the bill.  

I'll take the all you can eat buffet at the hotels anytime...sorry Bachi Burger you're overrated!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and sometimes just completely unresponsive (had to ask multiple times for condiments and to-go boxes).  Saw a waitress drop a set of silverware and napkin on the ground and then pick them up and take them into the dining room as if nothing happened.  Hostess never smiled once.  The ambiance inside is a little weird.  The kitchen is awkwardly exposed and cluttered and there was a loop of techno music going the entire time.  Burger was good, but not much better than average and does not come with a side."}
{"text":"OMG!!!

Thank you Yelpers for this AWESOME Discovery!!! The food is EXCELLENT!!!
I enjoyed this place so much that I came twice in 3 days. Great food, Great service and pay attention to the photography/paintings on the wall. The artist is great!
By the time you get a burger +frieds ( please share the fries - it's wayyyy too much for one person) & a drink - your looking at around $20 - Completely worth it! 

Please come to Los Angeles!!! We could use a place like yours here!"}
{"text":"Good lord was the 45 min wait worth it! I ordered the Miyagi burger and our table shared the oxtail chili cheese fries. Both were out of this world yummy! Servers were nice and helpful with the menu, too. Can't wait to go back to Vegas and try the Shogun burger, which has foie gras. *drools"}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday night around 8:30PM with 3 others and the wait was about 20-25 min.  I was staying at Mandalay Bay and from there it was about a 10 min taxi ride which was about 10 miles but there was very little traffic and its way off the strip in a tiny strip mall.  We saw this place on Food Networks- Diners Driveins and Dives and had to try- btw all the TVs in the joint were tuned to Food Network- wonder why?  :)

The wait was well worth it. When we were sat down we ordered a drink, I just got an iced green tea which was perfect and refreshing. Bummed they had very little selction of sweeteners but whatever.  They had a TON of drink items to choose from such as thai tea, passionfruit, boba etc.  Love the Asian drinks!
We started with appetizers of:

Pork Belly Steamed Buns- yummy but only came with 3 small buns and a hoisin based dip sauce, the pork belly melted in your mouth, but for our party of 4- not a lot to go around
Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries- delicious. your basic skinny fry with a pop. had jalapenos so they were spicy as well as a mayonaise dip sauce. I woudl have preferred the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- saw other ppl order they looked good!
Chili Fried Chicken- My favorite- well seasoned crispy and a mayonaise based spicy dipping sauce- perfect accompaniment

I also got the Spicy Miso Burger.  I love miso but I barely tasted it in this burger. This burger was the reason I deducted a star. (If I could give 3.5 stars I would have but I rounded up) It was well-cooked and beautiful looking but nothing special. The egg was cooked over hard and I barely tasted garlic or the Shisito peppers (which I am nuts for).   My friend got a Banh Mi burger that was waaaay more flavorful.

Overall a very positive experience. I am from LA where trendy burger places are rampant- so it takes a lot to impress me- this was good and the asian fusion was a nice twist from the regular ole- 5 guys, The Counter and Umami."}
{"text":"hands down one of the best burger spots around.  burgers run about $10 but they r damn good.  I really liked the ox tail fries but one knock on it for me is the beans. not a fan of beans in my chili. other than that, all the workers in their were nice and attentive.  If ur not fond of sweet burgers the ronin and Kiki burgers were on the sweeter side."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place.  One of the best east meets west fusion places I've been to.  First of all the burger buns are great.  The patty was cooked perfectly, just slightly pink in the center, and soo very juicy.  Me and hubby split the kalbi and the banh mi burger.  The kalbi tasted exactly like what kalbi beef should taste like, with just a tad of kimchi, but in burger form.  The banh mi tasted exactly like what I would expect from a vietnamese sandwich except again, in burger form.  Who knew that asian inspired burgers can taste soo good.  Then there's the truffle parmesan fries.  I actually got a little upset at my DH over this.  We had ordered only one order, and he kept eating them all while I was still eating my burgers.  Towards the end,  I just stared at him stuffing his face and told him that I will no longer fight with him for the fries. Next time we would just order our own."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners Drive Ins and Dive a while back.   It looked amazing during the show so naturally once in Vegas, this was the first restaurant we hit up.  
Its way off the strip which is the first plus.  
The service here is a below par.  The first trip was just slow, and the second, there was one guy doing all the serving while two lazy ass girls stood in the back drying silverware and a guy in a suit stood and watched.
Now to the food.  The oxtail chili fries are the best chili fries I have ever had in my life.  The mixture with the garlic aoli and jalapeno's are sooooo good.  They put a fried egg on top which was ok the first time.  The next time we went I got it without the egg and found it to be much more appetizing.  The egg just didnt go well with everything else IMO.  The pork belly sliders were ok.  The pork belly seemed to have been cooked a while before we arrived and it was really dry.  The flavor was good though.  
Food gets a 4.5, but subtract half a star for the slow service.
Pros:  Really good food, positive and upbeat atmosphere, location, staff is friendly.
Cons: Service is slow."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place.  Just up the street from me as well.  Burgers with an Asian twist.  Prices are very reasonable.  The staff is very attentive to the customers.  If you really are tired of the same burger joints this place is a must to try.  No more Red Robin for me."}
{"text":"Newer location. Service was prompt and courteous -- I was also the only person on a Monday about an hour before close. 
Most importantly, ordered Banh Mi burger and sweet potato fries. Both were amazing. Burger came with Nuoc Mam sauce good enough to drink."}
{"text":"So good even my picky daughter loves it. All the burgers are wonderful. The servers are always smiling and friendly. And if you love sauces they have a variety that will suit anyone."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! .. my new reason to come to Vegas .. oh and the Fries are Bomb too!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.. the only problem is it's way overpriced and the service is horrible.  

The burgers don't even come with fries, or any sides for that matter (all separate).  We sat for 10 minutes before the waitress came by at all."}
{"text":"Best burger in Las Vegas.   From the bun to the gourmet burger.  Flavors are so creative and the micro beers are unique."}
{"text":"The food quality and taste is 5 stars, but service is slow and everything comes out at different times which makes eating together very challenging. Half the party ordered burgers, they both came out separately and well before the two bowls of ramen.  The gyoza appetizers came out last!!  Gyoza is also covered in chili oil with dabs of chili paste which doesn't go well with kids.  We were afraid to send it back, fearing how long it would take to get plain gyoza so we tried to wipe it all off with napkins. 

We also ordered the oxtail covered fries, which were delicious.  The oxtail is more like chili so don't conjure images of the oxtail soup you get at the Cal.  

We tried to order a shake, but their machine was broken.  The waitress said they could try to see if \"the other side\" had ice cream to make it with.  At the end of the meal, the waitress asked us if we still wanted the shake as she obviously forgot she never game back to tell us if they found the ice cream.   

They really should think about remodeling and making one kitchen so they can time the meals better and probably get more seating to cut down the wait time!  

Employees don't seem very happy to be serving you as they're stressed and overworked with the types of crowds you see every day of the week."}
{"text":"Went to a second location in 2 days since family needed our Bachi fix before we head home.  We got there right when it opened and the employee apologized that it was a rough morning since someone didn't show. I said, \"well I hope the cook showed up!\" His reply was \"I am the cook!\"  Well he was a one man show...waiting the tables, cooking, seating the guests, refilling drinks, and bussing tables.  He was hustling!  The check said his name was Jesus.  He deserves to be recognized by management for his galant efforts!"}
{"text":"This joint puts a twist on your regular burger! They're open late. The service is good. Most of all, the price is right! My favorite is the banh mi burger. I've already recommended this place to a couple of friends and they loved it."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo...its a burger joint priced like a sit down joint.  Not bad, but not awesome as the reviews state.  Its burgers with stuff burgers don't need.  Why not go to 5 Guys for lunch and Lee's Sandwiches for dinner?  Banh Mi Burger, EW, to combine the 2 is a prostitution of food!!!  ( Reminds me of bacon ice cream) Really weird burgers and really not worth the price..."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food. Three stars for the service. Very slow. One burger came out very underdone. Was sent back (which we hate to do) and came out about equally underdone."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and decided to try it out. Little apprehensive at first on the idea of Japanese infused burgers w/ fries.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is your typical Japanese feeling, the dark flooring and walls, sushi bar seating, and asian décor on the walls.  I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger. This burger was not on their website menu, but I must say, if you know Asian Food it is all about presentation and it did not disappoint. Not only did the burger look good, but taste remarkable.  If you are into Burgers with a twist, I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome..! it never fails when i always come here. very helpful employees, they no what there talking about.. The last burger i had it was called MR.HO's burger consist of angus beef, cilantro, lup cheong, sauteed mushrooms on a taro bun..yuummmyy..!!"}
{"text":"If some people haven't noticed, I've been on something of a reviewing spree.  If you are indeed keeping track, this will be the final review for tonight.

The road to Bachi Burger was an interesting one, as we were heading to Monta Ramen, then to Carnegie Deli at the Mirage, and somehow Bachi came up and none of us in the car had ever eaten there before.  So it was decided, to Bachi we go.  We walk in, and are promptly seated.  the place was smaller than I had imagined, but on a Wednesday night, it wasn't busy, so there was plenty of space.

We sit down look at the menu, and are pretty much floored.  The three of us had no idea what to get.  The entire menu sounded amazing, from the Ronin burger to the Kalbi burger to their special of the night, the Spicy Miso burger.  After hearing the description of the special, we decided at least one of us has to order it.  And the other 2 ordered the other aforementioned burgers.  To round out the meal, we each ordered some sort of side.  We had the sweet potato fries, the garlic salt and pepper fries, and the parmesan truffle fries.  Thoroughly satisfied that we had ordered almost half the menu, we waited anxiously for our food.

The wait was a tad bit long, but the music there really helped the time go by.  They had played really nice throwback, old school music along with some hits from earlier this decade.  Lauren Hill, Ice Cube, John Mayer, Talib Kweli were some of the artists I remembered (It Was A Good Day was the song by Ice Cube, such a chill song, and a very fitting considering the meal we were about to just demolish.)  They also had ESPN on the 2 tv's in the restaurant, but it was just sportcenter at the time, so nothing too exciting.

Finally the food had arrived, and we were ready to pounce like tigers.  The burgers were without a doubt amazing, all of us taking a bite, then rotating the plates, so we could taste all the burgers and their deliciousness.  I had to give the burger of the night award to the Spicy Miso special.  The waitress highly recommended it, and she definitely wasn't lying to sell product.  The fries were amazing, with the parmesan truffle fries stealing the side order show.  They tempted us with dessert, and boy, did we fall for it.  They had hyped up their dessert special of the day, and they once again did not disappoint.  I dont remember what it was called, but it was only 5 bucks, and between 3 people, barely 2 bucks added per person.  Granted the serving was for more like 1 person, we were all so full, that it filled up all the left over spots we could have left.

After it was all said and done, we definitely agreed we have to come back.  I can't wait to see what special they'll have next."}
{"text":"There service alone was worth 4 stars. Food was great! Try this place!! It's a must if you come to Vegas"}
{"text":"We went there for Valentines Day and we ordered the Cesar salad to start. It was the worst Cesar salad I have ever eaten.Soggy with no taste,we politely complained about the salad and we were still charged for it, next. the burgers were terrible, undercooked and no flavor. we will never go back again. The place is over rated. 1 star because there is not a zero star option. Our check was $50.00 with TIP. ARE YOU SERIOUS THIS PLACE IS A JOKE."}
{"text":"O-m-g, this place is just crazy good! I can't even begin to explain how good these burgers are. The unique flavors sound odd but are so tasty. The fries were to die for too! Love love love this place!!h"}
{"text":"Hade the Ronin Burger...Awesome. Cooked perfectly. The Parmesan Truffle Fries were outstanding, The Beer selection was very good as well."}
{"text":"Got off our plane, got the rental car, and we were STARVING. My hubby and son just wanted \"a good burger\". Yelp led us here, and we are so thankful. There was a 15 minute wait because the place is quite small, but it was worth the wait. Burgers were very big and delicious! Cooked exactly as ordered. My \"no meat\" burger was an odd sounding combo of flavors- barley, tofu, eggplant, walnuts, etc, but it was the best vegetarian burger I've ever had. Onion rings were great but salty. Fries were decent. Our only negative was the overly loud club music they were playing at 2 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. My son has been asking to return all week, and he might get his wish!"}
{"text":"Good food...fast and friendly. We got all the appetizers and had a sample of them all was so delicious. Love the Ox Tail chili cheese fries!!"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas from Feb 3 to Feb 6, 2011.  Via yelp reviews, I wanted to give Bachi a try and I am glad I did, and actually ate at Bachie twice during my Vegas getaway.  Arrived las vegas on Thursday Feb 3, grabbed a rental car and first stop was Bachi as it is somewhat near the rental car facility.  Ordered the Banh Mi burger, salt n pepper fries and ice tea.  Burger 9/10 - nicely compose burger, great flavor!  Salt n pepper fries, 9/10 spot on, perfect, blends nice with the burger.  Ice Tea - The barley tea is usually good, had a least 3 glasses, a heavy ice tea with full flavor ~ I only drink ice tea (no coffee or soda) so this really hit the spot 10/10.  Service - helpful and attentive.  Total price $17 plus tip.  So good I went back on Saturday Feb 5 - wife and I ordered the steam short ribs - three tasty, tasty \"asian sliders\" as the waitress called them - 10/10.  Sampled both the sweet potato and Truffle Parmesan Fries ~ Sweet potato ok 7/10, T Parmesan 8/10 too much truffle drowns out the rest of the flavors.  (Hey how about a fries sampler - great margins in fries) Shared a Ronin Burger, nice flavor, great presentation, 6.5/10, but undercooked for my liking ~ consulted with waitress, she explained that medium is the way their are cooked, hmm, hmm ~ a medium cooked burger has quite a degree of variance, from a sliver of pink to gushy pink as this was.... Bachi, I would recommend noting on your menu that the burgers are cooked \"medium\" and describe it as such and empower/train your staff to recognize and solve customer problems.  Saturday 2/3, the staff was ill equipped and had problems meeting the needs of a 3/4 full restaurant.  While we ate, it took Bachi over 15 mins to seat four parties (one group actually left) with many tables empty - gotta work that bug out cause I want you guys around the next time I am in Las Vegas.  I dropped off a menu a the hotel concierge (joe/doug at the mandarin oriental) and told them this is a great place.  
Summary: Superior Food (noting the burger cooking issue), Service - needs improvement!  The food is too good to compromise with spotty sub par service."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! I went here when everyone was going to white castle for a 2hrs wait!? I lol'd  and ate the ronin."}
{"text":"Overcooked (very well done not medium), over-hyped and bad, bad management.  Given a 20 minuted wait time in an empty restaurant is absurd but we waited anyway.  In hindsight we should have walked a bit further in the center and eaten at Archi's Thai.  Two hours for two ill-prepared burgers and bad service.  Run, don't walk, to any of the other options in Village Square."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a low rating on the basis the food is expensive and the wait times are horrendous. This is a travesty to this place as it used to be so great. But I can see why Triple D can ruin a business. They are just not equipped or ready for high volume. They won't even take a reservation for locals who supported them before they were what they are today. 

But on a brighter note atleast they are thriving and living the American Dream!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. I ordered the Kiki burger and the beef was super tasty. I had asked for it to be cooked medium, but came out well done and a bit too crispy, but would still order again (but emphasize to my waitress my preference for how I want my burger cooked). Also had the truffle parmesan fries which are a must if you go! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had a burger with shrimp etc. the burger had a mix of items and was overall pretty great, but the taste was basically random because of a \"mixed patty with beef pork shrimp\", also milkshake was da bomb!"}
{"text":"The food was everything I've heard about.. and more.  WOW.  Those burgers were amazing.  I couldn't decide so ended up splitting the Ronin and Myagi-san with a friend.  Both were great.  The pork belly steamed buns were wonderful.  Reminded me of the ones I had at Momofuku milk bar in NY.  The duck steamed buns were just OK, not as good.  My only knock on this place, and reason for not giving it 5 stars, is due to the service.  There were empty tables but our party of five waited about half an hour before we were seated."}
{"text":"3 stars: A-OK

People who know me know that I enjoy eating off the strip.

Any burger joint with oxtail and foie gras on the menu instantly piques my interest.

So we went to Bachi Burger. 

The burgers were excellent. In fact, I went so far as to say the shogun burger here blew Hubert Keller's Rossini out of the water.

And the absolute piece de resistance was the oxtail chili cheese fries. 

I recommended the spot to everyone who would listen. I texted pics of the oxtail chili to encourage folks to go and check it out. Anyone who saw that fried egg sitting on that mound of chili and fries would certainly be compelled to go and order a plate for themselves.

Skip forward a year and change, and a visit from that Ferry guy with the frosted tips and that DDD show.

Inevitably, there's more patrons, the food quality suffers, and the portion sizes decrease. Getting on TV is both the best and worst thing that can happen to a restaurant. 

People who went there in the past have reported back, telling me how it's just not the same anymore. 

So now what? 

I guess it's time to look for another place before DDD ruins it."}
{"text":"The place smells like sewage, they should probably do something about that soon! Yuck I'll go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Would have given a negative star rating if possible.   Was asked to wait till everyone in our party arrived to be seated but the restaurant was only 1/2 full.    We asked if we could get a drink while we waited and was told again we need to wait till the rest of our party arrived.   We had a party of 4 and 2 of us were there.   Ggggrrrrr..... don't you want to make money?    We heard good things about this place as far as food goes but if this is the service. ....I say the food is not worth it.   We left and went to 808 tapa 2 doors down.   Great service from when we walked in the door.   Sorry Bachi.....bachi on you for bad service.   I'll be sure to tell everyone back home (Hawaii) to skip this place.  Too bad the owner is from Hawaii."}
{"text":"We were a party of 10 on Tuesday night originally going to the Windmill location, but with a broken AC, went to the one on Sahara instead.  There was no wait, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full.  The service was great - waters were never empty and plates were cleared accordingly.  Our server made sure everyone's burger was cooked at the right temp (asked us to cut it open to see).  Also, with such a large party, I was impressed that the food runners knew exactly which burger was whose (I think it's so tacky to bring food to the table and \"auction\" it off). 

On to the food.  We shared the oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, and truffle parm fries.  A member of our party commented that the oxtail fries tasted \"like fries with canned chili on top\".  I thought they were over salted and were nothing special.  The sweet potato fries were good (but Boiling Crab still has the best in town) - thick cut, seasoned perfectly.  The yuzu aioli, however, didn't quite compliment the savory-sweetness of the fries.  The truffle parm fries were a huge letdown.  I love truffle and was expecting to taste a little truffle flavor in each bite.  I got zero truffle flavor.  The mushroom cream drizzled on top was reminiscent of stove top mushroom gravy made in the microwave.  The tomato aioli, while good on its own, added nothing to the fries.  If the fries were truffle and cheesey enough, I don't think it would need any kind of sauce to accompany it. 

I got the Kalbi burger and my bf got the Kiki burger.  The meat was of great quality and cooked perfectly.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttered.  I really wish I loved the burgers (everyone else in the party did), but I really did not think they were anything special.  The Kalbi burger tasted like a burger slathered with kalbi sauce with some kim chee on top.  The Kiki burger tasted like a lot of bland.  All the ingredients sounded like it should have come together to make a great flavor combo, but it just didn't work.  I didn't even know there was caramelized onion, bacon, and guyere chesse on it until I looked back on the menu!  I thought it was just meat, lettuce, and some mushrooms. 

The price isn't considered cheap either.  $5 for frozen fries drizzled with stove top mushroom gravy does not a happy girl make. 

All in all, kudos for trying to come up with a fusion burger place, but at the end of the day, the flavors (or lack thereof) just didn't work."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a unique bite to eat! Try their oxtail fries! They are worth the trip and experience!!!"}
{"text":"A must stop when in Las Vegas. About 10 min. off the main strip. We had the Shogun burger($26, heavy, BUT it was the best burger I've had), The Tiki burger (nothing really special, it's good), the Oxtail chilly(lite cheese) fries (hot green slice peppers favored it wells). And Fried rice(don't remember the dish name, but a bit oily, still good).
Before heading home the next day, we had to stop for to go. lol Oxtail chilly cheese fries again! and with rice with pork belly (pretty good). Over all, it was GOOD!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning. Orders the burger with the egg and was throwing up non stop all night, and crapping like crazy. I called the next day and they completely denied it. It was the only thing I ate all night and the only thing I threw up. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"Not even impressed with this place,  Total rip off place  however the service was good  but the burgers are definitely wayyyy over priced.  Inside and out burgers had similar burgers for much less price and better tasting too! 

If you want to spend $ 22 dollars for a burger and fries, your better off going to BURGER BAR - LAS VEGAS @ Mandalay Place  100 times better than Bachi's"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in Las Vegas. I love their Bachi Fish, cod is always cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth. Fries are great too as well as their (papaya)boba drinks. A bit on the pricey$ side, but still worth trying."}
{"text":"It was past midnight as my homegirl and I were driving back to my place as conversation about grabbing dessert arose. After some driving, she suggested a place she actually used to work at that had boba and other snacks and before I knew it, we were pulling into Bachi Burger's parking lot.

My first impression of this place was obviously the interior. The place looked modern and so comfy. What made my experience here so dope was not only the food but the friendliness of each of the staff members. The manager made our visit very pleasant, as he joked around with my friend and I. The service was definitely top-notch and a lot better than even high end restaurants I've dined at in the past. It was easy to see that the servers were genuinely nice and enjoyed engaging in conversations with you. I even noticed how personable our server was as he made an effort to stop at every table every so often. I feel bad for forgetting his name so hopefully he sees this and pats himself on the back 'coz he is awesome.

Now.. onto the food. It took me a while to decide what I wanted since I wasn't hungry enough for a burger but had the appetite for something larger than just a dessert, which was what I wanted originally, haha. After scanning Yelp for a few suggestions, I went with the truffle parmesean fries and the mandarin orange tangerine soda (which I learned they make themselves). As cliche as this sounds.. it was definitely LOVE AT FIRST BITE. The truffle oil on the fries was the perfect touch with fries that weren't too crispy or too soft. The sun-dried tomato sauce paired with the fries was the cherry atop the sundae. The mandarin orange tangerine soda was simply amazing for something that sounds so simple. My friend told me this place is owned by two brothers, one being a former executive chef for Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. No wonder this place is so damn good!  As we sat and enjoyed our better than dessert midnight snack, I watched as the table next to us received their burger orders. The burgers looked mouthwatering. I was this close to ordering one but I'll save that for my next trip.This place is perfect for late night cravings, as they are open until 2AM. We left at around 130 and there was even still another table present but the dope staff didn't even rush them to leave. I definitely will be returning soon and by then, I'm sure Bachi Burger will be a household name. This is a restaurant that deserves to be part of the hype 'coz it sure as hell lives up to it."}
{"text":"Awesome place Kjosh did an outstanding job introducing us to the restaurant and making suggestions. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!! However the service sucked. We waited over ten minutes for a waiter and really weren't sure who our waitress was. She forgot drinks and never checked on is after dropping food off. The bus boys were fantastic and took great care of us. Again the food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"It helps when you come into a restaurant starving, but I also left very satisfied.   The spicy edamame was good for a start.  It had a little kick but nice flavor.  My burger was delicious...I cant remember the name, but I do remember the bun....so fresh and soft.  I must say the sweet potato fries and the Polynesian donuts were the highlights.  And our server. ..she was great....sorry, cant remember her name either...I guess im in a bit of a food coma...ate way more than I should have, but so worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first stop during our vegas trip.  I was really excited to try this place after seeing it on triple D.

The burgers were pretty good, cooked to our specification. 
The oxtail chili cheese fries was a disappointment.  This was the main reason i wanted to come here.  The chili was just not good.  Too many beans and barely any oxtail.

Worth a try for the burgers."}
{"text":"Why does the most amazing burger place have to open right before swimsuit season? The Kiki burger knocked it out of the park and for only $8, this place could be really dangerous!  I am going to have to go back just to try the deserts!

The staff were nice and very polite about our questions regarding the lack of a veggie burger - chef should have one ready in a couple of weeks.  My only suggestions would be to encourage the waitresses to be more attentive. The lunchtime rush has not kicked in yet, but they still seemed to be a bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries are a must, 15 thumbs up!! Can't really go wrong with any of the burger either. We've never had anything bad here."}
{"text":"Took a large party of adults and kids to visit and we had a great time.  Service was top notch and the food was phenomenal.  Everyone was raving about the burgers and the Oxtail fries were excellent.  The manager Marcos and the rest of the staff made sure we had everything we needed and took care of my entire party from start to finish.

Don't hesitate to try this place out!  We will return for sure next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Truffle fries are off the hook. Kalbi burger is awesome and an advice is add an egg and its phenomenal. Ive tried the oxtail fries it taste so good. i always tell my friends and clients to try this place. a must eat in las vegas"}
{"text":"Loved this casual, independently owned neighborhood burger spot near I-215 and Windmill. The shopping center is across the street from a large Von's shopping center at Windmill and Bermuda. Delicious burgers -- meat was cooked perflectly and service was outstanding -- served with tasty toppings and perfectly paired  condiments. I had a half of my Kiki burger, served with sweet onion marmalade and mushrooms (I skipped the cheese and asked for the Garlic chili aoili on the side)  wrapped in a lettuce leaf along with a salad and garlic edamame. Two of the guys in our group tried the Ronin Burger, served with Japenese cole slaw. Another had the \"Lonely Bird,\" a terrific ground chicken and turkey \"Tsukune\" burger.  We all loved the innovative menu and reasonable prices. French fry lovers, rejoice: Bachi serves several varieties of French fries -- Sweet potato (w/citrus aoili) Truffle Parmesan (w/Black truffle porcini cream sun dried tomato aoili) , Garlic salt and pepper and \"Just Fries,\" served with pineapple ketchup. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I was somewhat worried about coming to this place because some of the \"bad customer service \" reviews I sow. But for my first experience, their customer service was EXCELLENT! The food was just Awesome, super D-Lish. Great food, great ambiance, great service. 

A most check out place!!!

I'll definitely come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is on our black list!!! During our last and final visit months ago we walked out when a roach crawled up our table and into our beer glass. We trapped it and gave to the manager. They said sorry but didn't want to cause panic to other guests since this place is always full. They did divulge that the exterminator had come recently which admits they knew about the roach problem."}
{"text":"Go with 3 or more ppl. Order burgers n divide so you can get the real totally different tastes. Had Kiki ronin and spicy miso. Spicy miso and ronin were dope!  Oxtail fries not bad. Service at this place was a lil slow but food made up for it. Was worth the cab ride from strip. 

Went at lunchtime. 3 big guys. Could barely finish 3 burgers and oxtail fries. Delicious"}
{"text":"I had the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger.  The , the decor is as expected modern, and the restaurant is clean.  The staff are helpful and very attentive.  The food has so many flavors, man it taste great."}
{"text":"Yes my friends and I might've came in on their last call for everything but, as a paying customer wise?  You still have to cater to your guest! Period! I have been in the business for 18 years now, from front of the house to being a chef. 
To be honest, I do not like to be rushed when I just barely sat down and have not seen the menu! 
Anyways, enough with the bitching!  Food so far is not bad , came out fairly quick though?  Hmmmm? 
 Pork belly bao,  great flavor on point but came out cold! Like it's been sitting in the kitchen for a minute.  Portions on the onion rings? Too little for the portion...

Like I said, food is good. But service could be better!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a great experience and instead got the complete opposite! The hostess is by far the worst hostess to ever exist! She doesn't understand English and doesn't understand the priorities and importance of customer service! There was a large group of us who got here at 630! And following was another group of about 10 who got seated before us and her answer to us was \"they got seated first because they aren't as loud!\" ARE YOU FUCKING kidding me?! We sat there and waited to be seated and still with a horrible attitude she dares to say such a thing!?!???? I would NOT recommend this place to anyone with a large group! 10+ horrible and by far the worst experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently interesting, and the milkshakes are great. However, be prepared for a wait, subsequent to its Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives appearance. My son and I last tried to visit yesterday afternoon, at about 12:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and were told that it would be about a 35 minute wait."}
{"text":"Here you have a burger joimt. With ego's out of joint. Its ok but out priced for what you end up with. if your board and need to WASTE your money on a couple of burgers go for it. Just a side note my girl had the crab burger and had some problems later."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant during my latest stay in Vegas.  Originally, we had planned to eat at Miko's Izakaya, but it wasn't open for lunch.  Bachi Burger was in the same general area, so we ate there.  

It offers a very nice change from your usual burgers.  We shared the Ronin Burger, \"Ban Mi\" Burger,  Short Rib Buns,  Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries, and Truffle Parmesan Fries, which was recommended by our waitress.  I can be rather picky and wasn't quite sure of an egg on the Ronin Burger. The food tasted great!  The buns on the burgers were excellent. The fries and sauce were wonderful!    

Unfortunately, I forgot about the Portugese Donuts, so I'll have to try them during my next visit.  

I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried other \"premium\" burger places but found Bachi Burger the best:  burger most well prepared, presented, and most tasty of all so far, bit pricy but  well worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried the following: 

Ronin burger -- Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli.  Not bad but not spectacular either.  We ordered the meat medium done but it came closer to medium well done.  Personally I think there's too much going on with this burger.  Too many condiments for my liking.  When mixed together, the flavors become confusing and messy.  

Miyagi san burger -- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  Delicious!  The meat was juicy and tender.  The burger was huge because of the layer of crispy onion rings.  Couldn't fit it in my mouth so ate some of the onion rings first.  I'm a fan of onion rings so this was my type of burger.  

Oxtail chili cheese fries -- good but nothing special about it.  To me taste pretty much the same as any chili cheese fries, but just with some minced oxtail meat. You could taste a hint of oxtail but for the most part the chili flavor overshadow the oxtail flavor.  

Overall, good burgers.  I I would come again to try other items on their menu.  Next time I'll try the steam bao sandwiches."}
{"text":"The burgers make me sick after everytime. There must be something  that they put in the food. It doesn't  matter  which location  either. My boyfriend has the same problem."}
{"text":"I think I may have found my new favorite burger spot.   I typically try and hit up different spots on each trip out here to Vegas, but I may have to make an exception and make Bachi Burger a staple.   The restaurant is very clean and inviting, and the service was excellent from when we arrived, all the way through.   Haha, it's always funny when we see transplanted locals who recognize locals (From Hawaii) whether it me our \"look\", the way we talk, or in this case my clothes.   Anyways, on to the food.   We were a still a little full from breakfast, but I had to try a few different things.   Pork Belly Bao Buns.....excellent.   The pork belly was still very juicy, and super flavorful, yet with just the right amount of fat.  Oxtail Chili Cheese fries.....OMG .   At first sight it came out and was a mountain of fried, chili and cheese goodness!   I thought it was just a little chili, and a ton of fries.....nope.   It almost seemed like the chili was layered in there and was actually just the right amount. For our burger, we split a Kiki Burger which also didn't disappoint.   The mushrooms were sautéed nicely and not overdone, and the chesse and bacon were very nice compliments.   Oh yah, and the plantation iced tea was some of the best I've ever had!   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated so rudely and unprofessionally. I changed my drink order  twice and you would have thought I killed some one. Alexis--the server told me after I told her that I didn't want the Iced Matcha Green Tea, that the item would not be removed from my bill. I told her the drink tasted horrible like matcha mix and tap water and I did not want to drink it, because it did not taste good. She was extremely rude and I asked to talk to a manager. As a former food server, I know that removing an item from the bill is no biggie. I saw the manager coming over to our table and  I thought the problem would be rectified. The manager was rude and confrontational, instead of fixing the problem he actually made things worse; but eventually decided to take the $4.00 item off of our bill. The excitement my husband, son and I initially felt walking into the place subsided after all of this hoopla over a drink. We felt unwanted, negative vibes the entire time we were there. Despite all of this we decided to stay, like dummies and try the food. While we were eating, Alexis threw the check on the table. She did not bother to ask us what we thought about the food or whether or not we wanted refills on drinks, or dessert. I know as a server you never bring the bill over until you see that your patrons are done eating. She obviously did not get this memo. I seriously would not recommend this establishment and not because the food isn't good. A place of business should treat anyone who walks through the doors like family. The service provided by the server Alexis and the douche manager was absolutely horrendous. I will not be returning and I will tell everyone I know not to go also. SERVICE SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I live in Henderson, so this review is from a local.

I looked up what time they opened so I could be first in line for a take out for our lunch order. Looked up the distance and time so as to arrive around 15 minutes early. So I'm standing there and a bmw pulls up and sits right there in front of the entrance and of course leaves their engine on to run the a/c as it's around 100F out. The fumes started to bug me so when I saw one of the employees I knocked on the glass door and asked to sit inside (even though they weren't open yet) and he immediately let me in around 10 minutes early! One star.

I sat and people started coming in before anyone was seated, and I didn't feel like standing just to be first. When they started seating, the guy said ok, who's first (second star) and I stood, walked past the other people and said I'd like to make a take out order.

I just got two cheeseburgers and an order of fries. He asked me if I wanted L / T / O (lettuce, tomatoes, onions) and I said yes, how would you like them cooked? One well done, one medium. I forgot to tell them to burn my fries - I like them really crunchy. Oh well, next time.

The order took around 15 minutes or so (third star). The fourth and fifth star was for the first bite of my bachi burger. The bun is thin, so you don't have to unhinge your jaw to get a full bite. The burger is just tasty and juicy and I got l / t / o with every bite. Fries were good (crunchy next time!). For the fries, I'm in love with their pineapple ketchup. And they marked one well done!

Location: right off the 215, a couple cross streets down Windmill.

Total was $24 with change."}
{"text":"Went with two other friends tonight, everything we got was absolutely spot on.  The fries were fresh and crisp and well seasoned, the burgers were delicious, and we tried the homemade pickle appetizer, which was very good for the most part.  Prices were fair, service was prompt, and knowledgeable, and they had an interesting selection of beers as well.  I will be driving the 20 minutes to get a burger there sometime soon I get the feeling."}
{"text":"I came to this place on a Saturday and it was packed full of people, yet they managed to take my order and serve my food  within  seconds of me getting to the table, if you want a good burger that won't cost an arm and a leg, Bachi burger is your place."}
{"text":"Awesome, service was great and the food was outstanding.  My friends and I shared appetizers, fries, burgers and steam bun sandwiches.   It was a great way to taste a little of everything we ordered.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Didn't make it to the food.  I've been in vegas for 14 years and this is without question the worst service I've experienced.  I (and 4 others with me) work in the area, eat well, tip well, and don't worry about the cost.  Won't go back there again.  If there's any kind of wait, I'd suggest you find another option."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  Staff is super friendly and the food is WOW!!! The oxtail chili fries are the bomb"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Bachi Burger for the first time tonight, a Saturday evening.  We were given a gift card and went to use it.  The place is small and was very busy and lots of people waiting for tables in a small waiting area; very noisy.  We were told 15-20 minutes, we ended up having to wait over half an hour.  Then when we were taken to be seated, the hostess takes us to a back room with no other customers in it; I asked what about the main room?  It would take longer, so we decided to be seated since we were hungry.  A very unappealing room.  I was starting at the kitchen and back room area.  It's actually a whole other restaurant attached to the main Bachi Burger restaurant.  I guess they own it too.  Other people started to be seated in that back room.  We each ordered the angus burger and picked our toppings.  The food did come out in a timely fashion and our burger was very good.  Overall it was not a pleasant dining experience.  If we still did not have remaining money left on our gift card, we would not go back again.  Maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Next time we will try a week night and see how it is."}
{"text":"This review is a month late...been a little busy but wanted to make sure to plug this little burger joint in vegas as it was the best burger I could have imagined!  I admit, I saw them featured on the food network which was how I discovered them, and I proclaimed the next time I was in Vegas I would try them out.

I did have to wait for an hour to get a seat, but oh man was it worth it!  I also ordered the truffle fries which were a delicious compliment...asian fusion is hard to understand, but if you like the flavors you will love this burger!  Anyone local who has tried The Counter in Irvine, I gotta say this burger trumps that and the prices are better as well!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"I made my pilgrimage twice in one weekend while visiting Las Vegas. Friday night, 10pm, there was still a 25 minute wait-- a testament to how good this place is! I scored a single spot at the bar right away- the advantage of traveling solo. 

I had the steamed bun with pork belly and truffled fries, both excellent. If I had to nit pick, I'd say the truffle gravy is a bit strange, and the pink dipping sauce along side is a distraction. Possibly consider moving the truffle gravy to the dipping sauce location and just toss those crispy thin fries with truffle oil.

Sunday, on my way out of Vegas, they were not serving at the bar, so I waited 35 minutes for my one-top table. Service was fast and efficient. I had my old favorite, the banh mi burger and their onion rings- which are amazing. Thinly sliced and tempura battered- perfectly crisp. 

This is a don't miss spot- although you need to plan for a wait, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the employees of an establishment set the tone for the entire experience. The hostess with a tattoo of lips on one side of her neck and a diamond on the other side was so rude! I couldn't believe how disrespectful she was towards us customers. Maybe she should be working in the kitchen doing dishes instead of welcoming customers. It's a good thing the food was good. Otherwise, I'd definitely not recommend this place. 

The food was good; a bit overly rated in my opinion. The oxtail chili cheese fries was weird. The chili was sweet. The calamari was bomb. I had the spicy miso burger which was really good. My friends had the miyagi sans and said it was ok. My other friend had the Kiki burger and she said it tasted like any other burger, nothing special. 

Overall, glad we tried it out. Don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"We (party of 4) just had a fantastic lunch! We got the banh mi, miso, shogun, kiki burgers- all amazingly sizable and delicious. There was a special going on today, too, so we got a free small (felt pretty large to us) plate of the ox tail chili fries- definitely get it with the runny sunny side up egg on top. 

Also wanted to give a quick shoutout to our server Bianca who was beyond super sweet. Keep on keeping it real! 

If you have room for dessert, try the banana bread pudding!!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly  so good. Ya'll need to give this a try  happy hour has top shelf wine for $5 per glass the truffle fries were incredible not to mention the bain mi' burger was the best ground meat and well thought out ingredients don't miss this diamond guys and FYI 2 ppl with dinks under 50"}
{"text":"Only our 2nd time here, BUT once again, food is DEE -freakin-licious !!!  \"Kiki Burger was GREAT !"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure I would like this place but I LOVED it.  The Parmesan truffle fries were amazing. The plan was to order two burgers and share but neither of us wanted to give up more than a bite of our burger.  The staff was very helpful with our order and kept our drinks full and our bellies fuller.  We ordered the Kiki burger and the Miagi-sun. AMAZING.  So worth the drive off the strip."}
{"text":"The kiki burger is awesome. The Japanese style sauce is quite different from the burger we had before. This is the must try if you visit Vegas"}
{"text":"The miyagi-san burger was delicious and the truffle fries were the icing to my meal. The ambience of the restaurant was very nice and I felt welcome when the server came by to serve us. The service was really quick and checked up on us enough. Our waters were refilled when empty and everything we requested was given. Our dining wasn't very long but for the time being there when we were, quite the packaged experience. Friendly faces when you walk in. Will come back again to try other items on the menu. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 10+ times and food and service is always a 10. Staff is incredibly friendly and food is always amazing. Highly recommend the ronin or miyagi-San burgers. Alvin is one of the best servers we have had in town!! Must try and keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is super slow...we had to wait for drinks because \"they were washing the dishes.\" What?! My burger arrived well-done when I wanted it medium rare. Go on an off day when it's not too crowded and you'll have a good experience. We were there when it was busy."}
{"text":"Worst place to get a burger. Waited over a  half an hour for my simple burger and the place wasn't busy.  The sandwich was so so."}
{"text":"No vegetarian options available. It used to be the only burger place with good vegetarian burgers. Don't know what happened."}
{"text":"These are the best burgers I've ever had. The service is always great also. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I haven't ordered a bad thing off the menu, everything is always wonderful."}
{"text":"Grabbed a apple-lychee soda and pork belly buns......died and went to heaven!!!!! I'll be back! Thus place was wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Bachi Burger after reading many positive accounts of their food. Maybe it was all the hype and build up, but the experience was underwhelming (think I once had a lover say the same thing about me, but that's neither here nor there. what?).

The Miyagi-san burger came out perfectly cooked, but it wasn't anything to jump for Jesus over. The truffle fries...man I do not know what to make of those. They seemed soggy and the truffle sauce tasted like gravy. Expensive gravy.

Making matters worse wss that the service was bad, and I really hate saying that because any service industry position can be a real pain when dealing with the public. That being said, the server seemed rather disinterested and only stopped by to take the order and bring the bill (no refills or checking in to see how average the food was); it wasn't halfway full, either, and they appeared quite well staffed. Could've gotten her on a bad day, I suppose.

Overrall, if you're looking for an overhyped burger delivered with unenthusiastic bristle, this is the place!"}
{"text":"YUMM! most amazing burger ever! I work late and they are open late. Amazing food and excellent prices. Staff has definitely improved in the past year so despite previous complaints regarding staff. Fret no more. try the Manga Burger! YUMMY! Don't ask what's on it. Chances are you can't pronounce it anyway. Just eat it and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on 2011-04-20 for lunch after reading the reviews on Yelp.  Ordered the \"Ronin\" and the \"Kiki\" along with \"Just Fries\".  The burgers were very good - nicely cooked, soft brioche buns, good flavors.  The fries are average, but the pineapple ketchup picks it up.  Service is very good - but the place wasn't busy at the time.  Pricing is a little on the high side.  Overall, it felt like an upscale asian version of Red Robin burgers.  The combinations are intriguing... each element is strong on its own, but the combinations may not always work.  I gave it 4 stars because I was satisfied but not overwhelmed, and it was good.  It is a place that is worth visiting at least once for the experience if you're into trying out a new upscale burger.  Not sure I'd go out of my way to eat here again - I'd really have to be in the mood for this type of fare."}
{"text":"I only gave two stars because I nearly froze to death.  I asked the girl who seated us if she could ask to have it made warmer and she said she would try, but probably would not do any good.  So, it's ok for your customers to be cold while eating so that the cooks or whoever can feel better?!?  Or is the owner too cheap to turn on the heat? Whatever happened to having a nice cozy, want to go back environment for the customers, who without their patronage you would be out of business.  Listen to the customers input and your business will thrive. The food is good, but unfortunately I will not be returning. By the way, I saw many people who did not take their jackets off and who looked just as cold as I was through my meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend would be the biggest fan of burgers ever. So we decided to order a pick up from here because I wanted him to try out a different style of burgers. Called in and placed an order and they said it'll be ready in the next 20-40 mins. So we arrived there after 20 mins waiting at home. On our way there we received a call from them that it's already is ready which is great & was a pretty quick for a service. The food was pretty pricey not going to lie but it worths it. The patty has been seasoned so well tasted like a different way of kbbq. I got the Kalbi and his was a Kiki. We got oxtail fries but it wasn't as great maybe I'm just not a fan but it's ok. The burgers made up for it. Will be back"}
{"text":"Service sucked first of all. They served the kids meals last! ... After both parents and glasses were refilled. Glasses were only refilled when we asked. Food staggered out of kitchen. All food was not hot and 'fresh' ... probably sat by expediter longer than it took us to eat it. Honestly one of the worst experiences. They even asked if it was our first time, which it was. You would think they would go the extra mile to make us like them. Instead, they slouch walked the restaurant floor barely smiling. 

For the prices, I was expecting more, especially since it's competitive with Las Vegas strip prices. Instead, the flavors were that of a poser. Very unsatisfied with all we ordered. 

When the bill came, they put at the bottom of the receipt how much gratuity to give. Tip should be estimated before taxes, not after. Needless to say, but they got less than what they 'asked' for.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Great menu. Fresh burgers. Build your own or select ones they suggest organic burger if u want.  Truffle fries. Brussels sprouts the best!  Nice selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"This places doesn't serve the typical boring American burger. Bachi Burger provides so many different types of culturally influenced burgers. I recently moved out here from California, and immediately fell in love with this place. The Ronin Burger is one of the best burgers...and the fries are a must try!"}
{"text":"I always stop here when I am visiting Las Vegas.  The Kiki's burger and Bahn-mi are to die for!  Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Oxtail fries: The white on the egg was undercooked.  Pretty much lost my appetite there. 
Burger: bacon also undercooked and chewy
:(
It's been great in the past but consistency is a must for us to return. Goodbye bachi burger"}
{"text":"Like the burgers. I have tried several different types. Worth every penny!

The shakes and fries are a disappointment."}
{"text":"Really good food, and great service! Love the interior decor too. Tried the oxtail fries, the miyagi-san burger (its got an egg on it yum!), and the portuguese donuts with coffee gelato! Really Delicious! Definitely make a pit-stop here!"}
{"text":"First of all, the 4 stars are for food.  Service is one and half stars.  Very slow service, I think it was the waitress maybe forgetting to put in our order?  Several other tables that arrived after the two of us, got their burgers before we did.  Tried flagging the waitress down but she seemed to be avoiding eye contact.  
Ronin burger was good, sauce was a bit sweet but creative combination.
BF had the Black and green burger, he thought the blue cheese dominated the burger but I liked it.  Loved the buns, soft and light.  Ordered the truffle parmesan fries and garlic salt and pepper fries, loved them both.  Great menu, will be back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"Our waitress was extremely nice and accommodating since I'm vegetarian. We had a big group and she was still very attentive. On top of that the food was amazing. Best burgers and ramen I've had."}
{"text":"Burgers were good and cooked to our liking. It was interesting to try new flavors on a burger. The BBQ burger happens to be the traditional burger (no bbq sauce added). 

Customer service was OK. I had coffee to drink but it tasted as if it were sitting in the pot for hours."}
{"text":"Best burger I've EVER had!!! And I know what I'm talking about, I've had a lot of burgers!! Everyplace I've ever been to, I've always searched for the perfect burger. Well, I finally found it at this quaint las Vegas establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Totally new & unique spin on a burgers & fries. The duck steamed buns are a must, and worth every penny. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We have been eating off the strip lately, and have found some exceptional restaurants.  We had one of the best hamburgers we have ever had at Bachi Burger.  The hamburger patty was marinated, with a subtle but tasty flavor.  The bao buns were great.  There is a lot on the menu to try. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hawaiian fusion restaurant, very ono. This establishment is known for their burgers but I had the wings and the brussel sprouts which were amazing. I've had the burgers before and they are always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is awesome.. Kiki burger is the best burger I've ever had!!

This location never answers their phone though, so when I try to do a phone order to pick up.. I have to go there and order and wait 20 min.. That's not good customer service.. (Tonight was a prime example.. I really was craving a Kiki burger.., I tried to call 4 times.. It kept going to an answering machine...Its a Monday.. Not even a weekend.. So sadly I didn't get my burger.. I didn't want to wait 20+ min at the restaurant..and I didn't want to eat there.. I wanted to eat at home.. Relaxed on my day off) Also.. I hate that when I actually can get them to answer and place my order.. They make me give my card number.. I didn't have a problem with doing that until the last time I ordered.. When I got there.. My credit card number was stapled to my bag and it was out in the open for all to see!! I cancelled that credit card because anyone could have gotten my card number!! Made me very uncomfortable"}
{"text":"This place kills it! Staff was on point. Polite, quick, and efficient! Spicy miso was amazing and pork steam buns are always a favorite. Bachi never disappoints!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is PORK BELLY!!!! Absolutely amazing!!!!! 
Excellent service!
Awesome food!
New local area favorite!! 
We will back!"}
{"text":"Truffle fries were very good. I got the peking duck bun and I've had better. The duck was very good but the bun could be better. The chili oxtail fries were very sweet..not getting it again. server didn't refill our drinks. Service could be better."}
{"text":"Burger was not bad grass feed I think not.  We  spend $50.00 for 2 people for that price i could better service somewhere else.  Grass feed have a distinct flavor and a hint of grass.  This one have no taste but the buns were very soft.  The  waiter came about 10 min after bring steated and gave our table to another staff, I guess we are not the type of customer he wanted to serve. The other waiter must be new cause he did not know the menu. I asked for a rare but got a medium and the wife wanted medium got medium well.   Service was the worst since they have 6 employees and about 6 tables during lunch.   The server took our order and disappear only to reappear to give us the check.  He never ask how the food or burgers were.   We had to flag down another server for refill and extra napkins. But guess what the servers were hovering around the white tables.  It took 10 min to get a to go box but the check go to the table before I  took my last bit of burger.  Guess they did not want us there i guess we are the wrong demographic for the restaurant.  as a  chef I would be ashamed of my staff and I am a chef for the past 15 years in Vegas. Left the place disappointed and felt like we were not  welcome there.  I could got a better service at a Mcdonald.

{"text":"Just had to try this most talked about eatery.  This one is located in south Las Vegas...pretty easy to find.
Our party of three got there at 9:30pm on a Sunday night.  It was busy, but there was only one couple ahead of us, so the wait was less than 10 mins.

The service was prompt and friendly.  Just viewing the menu was interesting.  This place has some really, REALLY exotic burgers (understatement of the day)!  However, it's a huge plus that they have the ingredients listed for each of the items on the menu.

For appetizers, we got the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, the Pickled Vegetables, and two dinner salads.  These were all fresh and very tasty.  The Oxtail Fries were huge.  We were quite impressed with these starters which only added to the anticipation of our burgers.

I got the Spicy Miso Burger, the wifey got the Ronin Burger, and the daughter had the Kiki Burger.  They were all pretty huuuge.  My Spicy Miso was not spicy at all, which didn't bother me a bit, but I suppose some you who order spicy, may expect spicy.  Well, the burger tasted just out of this world.  I loved it, and mopped it up.  It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  No strong miso taste at all.  The other two with me also enjoyed their burgers.  They're both smaller eaters and had to doggy-bag half of their burgers each.  The bun they use for the burgers is more like a sweet bread, which certainly adds to the exoticness.

All-in-all, this was a great experience.  Great staff, great service, awesome food.  This is a new must go spot for us.  I must say that this blows away the Shake Shack, which I reviewed last week.

I couldn't give it 5 stars as it was a bit pricey.  But then, I'm a bit cheap. Lol"}
{"text":"Did not even get sat, before walking out.  One family sitting at a table, and the rest of restaurant completely empty.  Stood at front for 5 minutes and when I asked if we could sit at a table (had 2 elderly people 80+ years with me who can't stand for too long) we were basically yelled at to wait!  That the server is not ready for you yet!  After waiting another few minutes, we just left.  Never experienced such rudeness in my life! Who knows how good the food is....doesn't matter when you're treated like we were bothering them by entering the establishment. Maybe that is why there was only one table filled in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Bachi Burger because I saw it on Food Network's Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. It was pretty far from the strip where I was staying but the drive was well worth it. The food was amazing.

The ox tail chilli cheese fries were delicious. All five people in my group has one of their signature burgers. The black and green burger that I had was excellent. Very tender with great flavor. 

The service was very good. They were well trained and could explain their dishes well.

This place was fantastic for anyone who loves good interesting food in a relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Came in the other night to enjoy some Oxtail fries with my homies. Paul was super chill and made us feel at home! Bout to grub there again next week!"}
{"text":"If you want hi quality burgers then Bachi Burger is the place to go. Angus beef or Wagyu burgers, pork belly buns for appetizers and oxtail Chili cheeses fries!"}
{"text":"we were not impressed. Average wait time. Average tasting food. We should have stayed closer to the strip."}
{"text":"Thiswas byfar the greatestburger thative ever eatenin my life. Thereare really no wordsto describe how wonderful it is. Went there after a Cirque details Solei show whilei was in Vegas. The oxtail chili fries were to die for. Iwas slightly under the influence during my visit, so I'm having difficulty remembering the name of my Burger I do recall that I ordered it medium rare and it literally melted in my mouth with each bite .Wow, wow, wow!!! That is all"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and an amazing combination of flavors. You won't regret picking this place!"}
{"text":"We always leave with full satisfied bellies. Today we tried spicy miso and mr. Ho's burgers with a side of truffle parmesan fries. This place never fails us. We also love their oxtail chili cheese fries, Thai tea, and green tea."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to dine. Unfortunately, the service level, quality of food and general attitude of staff and chefs has really gone downhill. As an example, I arrived last night with six others in my party, and we were told we would need to wait at least 45 minutes. The dining room was about 2/3 full with nobody waiting. The host explained that the chef \"wouldn't allow anyone to be seated as they were having trouble getting the orders out fast enough\". I find it hard to understand why the management of this restaurant would promote this type of info to be given to its customers, or how, on a Friday night, they would not have enough staff to handle any expected or unexpected increase in volume. My guess is that the management has changed, or the management is overwhelmed, or the management is asleep, or the management is stupid or the management doesn't care. Either way, I would avoid this place until they get their act together or don't go there ever because they will soon be out of business!
We went to Kona Grill and were seated within 5 minutes of walking in."}
{"text":"First time at Bachi Burger and i loved it....my wife kept raving about it and thought I had the best burgers already!  So I decided to give it a try and ordered the Kiki Burger (shiitake mushrooms...yummy!  A bit pricey for a burger but the price matched the quality...nice juicy, tender, angus beef!  Customer service was good..."}
{"text":"Always great everything....don't miss the ox tail fries!!  Asahi beer on draft!!! This restaurant is always very clean and the staff is always very professional and helpful. Go...you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"I did not dine here but tried to order take out. Called once and was placed on hold for more 5 mins. I then called back 5 times over 15 mins and got a voicemail each time."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the lack of service doesnt warrant a return visit. I was really looking forward to trying this place based on all reviews. Being in the service industry myself,  I was wildly disappointed.  After my food was served, not one person of the 9 front of the house people I counted bothered to ask how my dinner was. Not one offered more water. Not one cared that I needed another napkin.   I finally had one girl notice me and was eager to get my check and leave. I work at Bellagio, I guess my standards are high, but this was just terrible service."}
{"text":"Stopped here this past Friday night for dinner.  Based on the previous reviews, I was expecting a crowd.  We showed up around 6:30 and there were only about 4 tables seated in the restaurant.  Not that I'm complaining about being immediately sat on a Friday night.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries based off of the many Yelp recommendations.  They were ok, but both my wife and I thought the chili was oddly sweet.  

The sweet trend continued with the burgers.  I had the Miyagi-San burger and my wife had the Black & Green burger.   I ordered mine medium and she order hers well done (I know it's a sin, I'm working on her).  However, mine came out well done and hers came out medium.  If we had ordered the same burger we could have just switched but it would have been a difficult task because of the different sauces on the burgers.  Mine had that same oddly sweet flavor from the chili cheese fries, while hers did not.  The buns were solid and held up to the sauces well, but I just couldn't get past that sweetness.  It was a decent enough burger, but when you're paying $15+ for a burger it better be extraordinary.  This one was just ok, but with a side of sweetness.  I would go back to try one of their other concoctions, but I would shy away from the Miyagi-San."}
{"text":"A couple of good friends suggested that I try this place. I went in yesterday expecting a nice relaxing lunch and some great food. Instead I was absolutely mortified about the absolute unprofessional and crude behavior I witnessed. 
The food WAS good, I must say that. BUT... who ever was in the back SCREAMING and CURSING at the top of their lungs RUINED everything. I was shocked and appalled that someone would behave like that knowing full and well that children and guests could hear that. The look on my wife's face as well as a few other people around me was that of shock and disbelief. 
I'll never go back and I hope you think twice before you do too. I don't want to support that type of business. 
I don't care what they were upset about, NOTHING warrants that type of temper tantrum. 
So sad too because my server and food was good. Maybe all that anger makes the food good. HAHA. 
Too bad I left sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"I had the Ronin Burger, an order of garlic fries, and a drink

The restaurant is a nice enough dine in establishment with a good selection of drinks.

I was with a group of friends, we had ordered and ended up waiting a while for our food to arrive (roughly 10 minutes for the fries and 20 minutes for the burgers). It was a long time, but I was with company and it only made me hungrier.
I think part of this was due to a large 10+ person party arriving just before us, so it was probably just bad timing, but still, it was a long time to wait after ordering our food.

The burgers are expensive, but the size and amount of toppings compensate for it.
I found the Ronin burger to be extremely tasty, but unfortunately due to the sauces, the bun got soggy really quickly, so after half of it I didn't want any more and just picked at the rest of it.

My friends didn't seem to have the same problem though and they got different ones (my apologies as I don't remember what they ordered).

Overall 4/5 stars, I'm interested in coming back and trying something different.
If the wait is just as bad without a huge group and a different burger ends up soggy, then I may adjust to 3/5, and if it's not the case, I'll adjust to 5/5 (as those first bites were very tasty)."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I was not expecting to love this place so much. I love burgers, but had not heard much before trying the restaurant. On the same trip to Las Vegas, of course this was another one on the list for me to try. And I am so happy I did! I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :)

The three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.

The first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!

Kiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.

Would highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well. Want to go again soon!"}
{"text":"One of, if not THE best burger I've ever had. The waiter was really nice and recommended options based on my input. I also had a Nitro beer that was OUT OF THIS WORLD! A bit pricey, but worth it for a good meal."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and get a burger from here. All burgers here are made from wagyu beef. For those who dont know, Wagyu refers to several breeds of cattle bred for intense marbling and producing a high percentage of rich unsaturated fat. Basically this beef is high quality AF.

First of all, the restaurant is usually busy. So you may need to wait 10-30 minutes. BUT it's worth the wait. The staff is friendly, cleanliness is spot on, and the ambiance is casual. Enough with the basics, let's talk about the food.

I got the Banh mi burger. Under the bun is a patty made of Angus beef, pork and shrimp, topped with a thin slice of grilled pork pâté, crisp lettuce and hints of lemongrass, herbs and curry aioli. On the side is are pickled slivers of carrot and daikon radish, with jalapeno slices and a shallow bowl of nuoc mam, a sweet sauce with a marmalade tang and a hint of garlic. The burger was very juicy, and \"fluffy\" if that's even a right term to describe it's texture. Basically the burger is cooked right, not too tough, and very meaty. It tasted really good, perfect for your inner carnivore. The burger is delicious and filling,  enough said. The fries are meh. Their tough and barely salted. It's the sauces you get with them that makes them good.

A great place to go too. Will be back again."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse and worse want a good burger grill them yourself at home can't beat that"}
{"text":"After watching diners, drive ins and dives, we had to check this place out while in Vegas. My family ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, the spicy miso burger, the Ronin burger, and the pork buns. The food was really good. The spicy miso burger was the best. The friendly service and the unique combination of Asian inspired flavors with traditional fast food American, makes this a place we will be sure to visit again next time we're in town. I'm knocking off 1 star because the boba would've been way better blended, rather than poured over ice, and the oxtail fries didn't have much of a unique 'oxtail' flavor to it."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries were great but the burgers are the bomb!  Kalbi, Kiki, and Miyagi burgers were made perfectly. Miyagi burger was the best!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. The burger was drenched in teriyaki sauce and was way too salty. It was way over priced too. I was expecting the best burger ever but it didn't taste as good as it looked. I rather eat In n Out. Oh yeah the Ox tail chili fries were good but they were cold like it was sitting around for 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We came here based off other yelp reviews and we are so glad we did! Tried a ronin burger, a spicy miso burger, and a regular angus burger and they were all fantastic! Best burgers we have ever had. They had such nice combinations of flavors with the burgers. For example the spicy miso burger came with Apple vinaigrette, and normally I cannot stand vinaigrette so I got it on the side in case I didn't like it- it complimented the burger so nicely I can see why they had it in on there!
Staff was also extremely friendly and helpful as to what to pick and what influenced the different burgers.  
Absolutely wonderful and we would definitely come back. We fully agree with the assessment that these are the best burgers in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Came in to see what all the hype was about. Will never come back. First off, our waitress was irritatingly fake. The food came out quickly, and considering it was a simple order (plain burger with just cheese and bacon) you would think they would get it right the first time. The burger was undercooked and when we sent it back politely the manager brought out a new plate 10 minutes later and informed us they put on new toppings but the burger was the same. I'm in the food industry and this is against health code and severely frowned upon. Not to mention the fact my girlfriend is pregnant and even though we were polite about the request, our waitress kept staring at us strangely and gave her fake \"how is it now?\" question several minutes after the manager brought out the new plate...made me paranoid that something was altered to the food. I will be calling in to the health dept also known as my friend \"\" \"\" and report them as well as tell everyone I know not to eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"Great food! I opted for a quick ramen bowl as I had visited for lunch. The atmosphere was great and I even went for a Lychee Boba which had tons of flavor, not crazy sweet, and was icy cold. The ramen bowl had tons of veggies, bean sprouts, fresh noodles, and a flavorful broth (not greasy) as I went with the seafood (Tantanaki??) option. 
Those who I dined with opted for pork and chicken stating these options were quite salty. Whatever you choose, the bowls come packed with plenty to spare. You will definitely leave stuffed. Wouldn't advise wearing white for splash purposes. I also saw some crazy oxtail chili fries and a stacked burger before I left. If youre on a diet ABORT MISSION. Overall, chill experience."}
{"text":"I can not review the food as we were never served.  I can't even tell you if the water was decent, because no one ever came to the table.  We sat there for 15 minutes, while wait staff walked around us, never looking at us.  Unfortunately, we hadn't eaten all day and decided to finally try Bachi spurred on by seeing it Triple D of the Food Network.  It was only 4:30 in the afternoon and the tables weren't even full.  We saw others sitting around in the various stages of not being served, some had empty glasses of water and some had drinks, but they all still had their menus and had the same look my table did...what the heck?

The menu looked good, but to us, service is so important.  There are just too many choices in Las Vegas to be ignored like we were."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Sometimes the wait is long but well worth it. I had recently visited the location after quite sometime and they expanded the restaurant space. Try the spicy miso burger!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give 3.5 stars. When is Yelp going to start allowing half points?

Bachi Burger is good food. Not overwhelmingly superb. However, there is a combination of different flavors that are nice on the palate.

I've tried a sampling of their menu - from loaded fries, to ramen soup, to burgers - the overall review is... Everything is a bit heavy on the salty side. Bacon jam is going to be salty, I get it. Use of cumin would be better than salt though. Their oxtail meat is super tender, however, I think they cook it with too much salt.

Let's point out the vegetarians. They're not really going to like Bachi Burger, as their aren't a lot of vegetarian options... Especially if you don't want soup. More variety would help bring in more clientele.

I'll go back. I do really like the oxtail fries."}
{"text":"This place is so good it hurts. Due to the greatness of this place, I've relegated it to special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries and days that end in Y). I go for the Shogun almost every time (seared pear, unagi and foie gras... ahhhhh). But then add the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries and forget about it... food coma time. If I could eat here everyday, I would. In fact, my bday is next month... see ya there!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the service was a joke.  When you pay $15 for a burger, you shouldn't have to pay extra to change the kind of cheese on it.  And...when you have to order your fries a la carte for $4...you shouldn't have to pay for extra ketchup.  As we were leaving I had to ask whether I would be charged extra for a box to take the rest of my burger to go..."}
{"text":"The service at Bachi was ATROCIOUS, but the food was unbelievable and made up for it.  We waited forever to be seated, even though there were loads of open, clean tables.  The server took ages to take our order, and then the only other time we saw her was when she dropped off the check (someone else dropped off the food).

My boyfriend had the banh-mi burger and I had the Wagyu beef burger with foie gras (I forget what it's named), and the burgers were absolutely unbelievable - juicy, tender, and full of amazing flavors.  My boyfriend got the garlic chili fries, which were fantastic.  I got the truffle parmesan fries because everyone on yelp raved about them, but the fries didn't taste like truffle OR parmesan.  They tasted like regular, mediocre french fries, so I'm not sure if I got screwed on the fries or if everyone else doesn't love truffle like I do...

I worked as a hostess and server for years and I know how a restaurant operates.  Bachi clearly doesn't.  It looks like someone with an amazing palate decided to open a restaurant but has no idea how to run it, and now that they're busy, they're swamped and don't know what to do.  Having said that, those burgers are probably the best I've ever had, and totally worth the crap service.  I'm definitely going back (which says a lot because I'll usually NEVER return to a place with awful service!)."}
{"text":"We've heard good things about this place, so we were really excited to try it. Sadly, we didn't get the chance due to crappy service when we walked in the door. There were several empty tables, but we were told there was a short wait. That wasn't a biggie, so we sat in the waiting area & perused the menu. Lots of parties finished their meals & left. About 20 mins went by & we noticed that no tables had been cleared & no one waiting had been seated. Another customer asked the hostess if they were saving tables for a large party or something & she said \"no, we're just backed up\". 20 more mins went by & more tables became available- still they were not cleared & no one was seated. The hostess was rolling silverware & doing other side work instead of trying her best to get people seated. After 45 mins of waiting, we counted 12 empty tables & only one other party had been seated. 

Having worked in restaurants in the past, it is unacceptable to me to have a hostess doing side work when there are seating issues. It should not take more than 10 mins to get empty tables cleared & people seated, especially a party of 2 like us. If you are short staffed, the hostess can help bus tables to get your wait times down. 

I can't review the food or waitstaff service because we decided to leave after waiting for nearly an hour & still not being seated. I'm loathe to give this place another shot after this experience."}
{"text":"All I can say is I wish we had a Bachi Burger where we live.  The food is fabulous!  Very creative and tasty.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger restaurants ever! I couldn't finish the burger but it was soooo good! The truffle fries and oxtail fries were sooooo good! Our server Dan was the best!!! A must try!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER return to Bachi Burger ever again. And unfortunately, it's because of the service. I asked if the Banh Mi sandwich was a choice between beef, pork, shrimp and our server said yes. I said, I'll take the \"shrimp banh mi burger\" and then followed by \"no pork pate on that\". It arrived and it was ground meat and I thought, \"okay that's weird. Is that ground shrimp?\". I took a few bites and realized it tasted like a mixture that included pork. So I grabbed the server and asked her and she said that it was all mixed together. At the time I ordered my food, shouldn't she have corrected me when I asked for that \"shrimp\" banh mi sandwich? I tried to get something else but the server said, \"well, we'll have to charge you for the new item\". Excuse me? I grew up in the restaurant and hospitality industry and that is NEVER the answer. It wasn't the cost but the fact that she didn't seem to care. A few minutes later she came by and said, \"oh, we are offering a complimentary dessert to moms for mother's day. Would you care for the dessert?\". Um no, I would love some lunch before my dessert please. I am appalled that they allowed me to walk out their restaurant knowing that I was very unhappy and still hungry.  Really bad move on their part and perhaps a restaurant manager should have stepped in. They should have just eaten the cost of the new burger to make a customer happy. It would have resulted in repeat business that would have more than made up for that $8 burger."}
{"text":"*drools*

Absolutely loved this place! Came here once while in Vegas and I'm so glad we came here. We were staying on the strip, but we had a rental car, so we drove here.

I ordered the black and green burger with salt and pepper garlic fries and momotaro soda.

The burger: Absolutely delicious and very very filing. The patty was pretty thick and had a lot of flavor in it. What made it really filling were the mushroom, bacon, and blue cheese. When you throw all of this, it makes for a really great burger, but do make sure to try it while on an empty stomach!

Fries: The fries was very good. Crispy and had the right amount of flavourings. However, do make sure to share it because the portion is meant to be shared.

Momotaro soda: First time I've tried peach and strawberry soda. I tasted a lot of peach, but not a lot of strawberry, but I'm not complaining.

Price and value: For burgers, they're pretty expensive at first glance, but once you factor in the stuff they put in, it makes sense and the quality of the ingredients are high, so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"sub par service, above average food.  
no sweeteners offered with iced tea. 
had to ask for napkins.
server more interested in sidework, taking a smoke break in plan sight than to attend to table. 
food timing off; salad not delivered before burgers. 
next time, will order to-go."}
{"text":"Love love love!! Worth the wait, the oxtail fries were superb i nearly inhaled them. I thought I couldn't eat anymore but then the Kim burger came and it was irresistible. Beyond expectation :)"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The food is always amazing and the service is good. From the burgers to the raman, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Hit or miss here. Burgers are pretty fantastic but the service is sub par. They are just order takers and don't guide you through the menu so you will have to figure it out on your own. Kikis burger is my go to but it was undercooked this time around. Waited at the bar for 15 minutes before the server came by. If the food wasn't so good I would have walked out. (Again!)"}
{"text":"Came here from LA to visit friends and we went to Bachi Burger for lunch. I gotta say, their burgers are juicy and so delicious! I highly recommend this place to anyone that's craving for an awesome burger. I had the Miyagi-San burger. If you'd like an egg on your burger then gotta give this one a try. And the oxtail chili cheese fries go great with the burger as well. The service was great too, great staff.  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Place was awesome!  Ox tail fries, sliders and the burgers were off the hook.  Worth the drive before a round of golf."}
{"text":"ATTENTION!.... Bachi Burger is one of Vegas's best kept secrets

I bring all of my visiting friends here, they leave super jealous that they don't have one in their city. We love that they do something different, each item is very unique and creative. You wouldn't think that the flavors would mesh so well but man do they!

Here is my MUST try list:

Oxtail Chilli Cheese Fries
Spicy Miso Burger
Truffle Parmesan Fries
Chili Fried Chicken
Black & Green Burger
Ginger Chili Edamame
Strawberry Jasmine Lemonade

Even if you aren't a big fan of Asian fusion, its hard to deny a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"Underwhelming dinner at Bachi Burger on Windmill.

Pickles were ok, but the guy who brought them to the table couldn't even identify one of the vegetables. He shrugged and was like \"I asked them before and they mumbled something I couldn't understand.\" lolwat? Half the pickles (3 of the 6 types) were pretty sour (eggplant, radish, and some kind of gingery onion -- the others were cucumber, spicy seaweed, and garlic). The pickled garlic was pretty solid, very nutty.

Pork belly bao were good. Wife's comment \"eh, Momofuku's were a lot better, but maybe that's not fair.\" lol

Burgers: Split the Miyagi-san and the Banh-Mi. First bite of Miyagi-san was great with the sesame and the onion rings. But honestly subsequent bites were good-not-great. Banh-mi was overwhelming imo due to the curry. We got through half the burger and just decided to pass on the other half.

Took a PB & Chocolate milkshake to go, and the waitress brought it in a to go cup and then disappeared for like 15 minutes, never bringing the check. There's a reason we ordered that to go! Anyway, milkshake was too thin for my liking (I like thick shakes) but tasted good.

Wife's comment leaving was \"that was fine, but I don't really need to go back.\" I feel the same way."}
{"text":"My absolute fav burger place in the valley. All the burgers are great!! Love the fries as well!! I also love they are open late. My only thing is is wish burgers CAME with fries. The place can get a tad pricy but totally worth it in my opinion! :)"}
{"text":"What do you get when you ground together beef, pork, and shrimp an put it into a burger? You get cr-p! I had the ban mi burger. They put too many different ingredients together that didn't pair well and it made me sick. I dont know what all the hype is about. The food is expensive and bad."}
{"text":"This place used to be a must go to when we are visiting Vegas, but this last trip has left a bad taste in my mouth. Their burger didn't have that great flavor it used to have in the past and the service was HORRENDOUS! Our server kept dropping things, didn't routinely check up on us, and seemed more interested in chatting with his coworkers. Also we were there when there were only about 4 tables so I'm scared to visit on a busy day. The reason it doesn't get a lower score is because of the past performance."}
{"text":"Yelpsters and the locals raved about this place so I stopped by for lunch and was not to be disappointed.  Ordered the Truffle parmesan fries which is enough for 2 people and the Spicy Miso Burger.  The picture does not do these items justice as this Asian fusion burger was over the top in my book and the truffle parmesan fries was one of the best that I have had. Service standards were top notch as I noticed the servers and bussers worked as a team and it was apparent that cleanliness in the \"front of the house\" was spot on!"}
{"text":"The burgers are overrated. Red Robin burgers are way better and tastier and cheaper! Service lacked. Server was a little sassy. We won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yelp has pull down may bad review of the restaurant because it involved Management swearing at it's employees. I thought we had a little thing in this country called the Constitution which guarantees freedom of press. It makes me wonder if business owners are paying off your help to take off bad reviews. Shame I never want involved in this type of practice. If they don't like customers telling the truth about the restaurant they need to change their practices. I have noticed that quite a few reviews of this nature in regards to this particular restaurant. To be clear. This is a repost. I haven't returned to this place and never will but I will keep reposting if yelp removes it. I believe in free speech and people should know how bad this place is."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is where it's at. Red Sangria for me, and delicious. This was my first visit and I was very impressed. The waiter wasn't spectacular but he did take care of us so they don't lose any stars for that. The food was delicious, veggie burger definitely a must try. I don't eat meat so this was such a treat for me! The fries were pretty damn awesome too.

I will definitely be back. And most likely during happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Oh.  My. Goodness.  We heard about Bachi Burger on the show Triple D, and noted it, as we were about to head to Las Vegas.  We arrived a bit early and wondered if they were open for lunch as early as 11:30??  When we opened the door, we were pleased and surprised to find it PACKED!!  We were shown to a table, and studied the full, varied menu!  And we only had one opportunity to eat here on our trip! Shoot!

Our waiter Blade was extremely helpful, and at his suggestion, we ordered two burgers and split them, so we could each try several.  We had the Ronin and the Miyagi-san, along with the terrific sweet potato fries.  

OMG.  Seriously.  These were THE BEST BURGERS WE HAD EVER EATEN.  I was so sorry I could only eat one.  They both had the most amazing taste, they were moist, flavorful, and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!  I cannot explain how amazing they were.  The fries were very good, too.  No doubt about it - whenever I will be back in Vegas, I WILL find a way to have a meal at Bachi Burger.  Have I mentioned they were AMAZING????
If you're in the area, you will NOT regret a visit to Bachi Burger.  Now if only they would put one in San Francisco!!"}
{"text":"When you think Vegas strip you think good food. Now when you think of a Vegas Strip Mall you can think of Bachi Burger. Located in a strip mall off the beaten path this burger joint does something unique and special with the gourmet burger craze. The beef is Japanese as well as the interesting toppings. It's not cheap but it's also not going to leave you disappointed and still starving. The have different styles of flavored edamame that far exceed the typical steamed and salted you get everywhere else. They also have some great beers to accompany the amazing burgers and a few are from Hitachino Brewery, like the White Nest  Ale and Red Rice Ale. Check out the menu online and I bet, no Vegas pun intended, it will make you want to go."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Come hungry because you will want to order everything..... and you should. Well you should definitely order an appetizer like their steamed buns or french fries. I really admire their sweet potato fries for some reason. Maybe because they come out hot with their own dipping sauce. Actually all of their fries are paired with their own dipping sauce. I've been here twice and I can't help myself from continuing to order the Kalbi burger. I love Korean food and this burger is the perfect combination a Korean themed burger needs. The Kalbi is also served with a small side of pickled cucumbers. MMMMMMMMMM.
Watch out because this patty is juicy and it drips all over the place but it will not stop you from enjoying your meal and experience at Bachi. The bun does it's job by holding everything intact. Amazing burger.
 They play some pretty banging music too, just wish they had a speaker in the bathroom. 
Definitely a must stop if you are in Las Vegas. Hell, Bachi was a huge reason I decided to go back to Vegas last month."}
{"text":"Ate here on friday 10/4, after seeing it on diners drive in and dives. We had the oxtail chili cheese fries, the ronin and the kalbi burger. It was honestly one of the best meals ive ever had in my life! Growing up in hawaii, it really had a lot of local flavors that I missed! The service was great too!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was also my last.  The hostess was extremely rude.  I mean I get that it's busy but as the hostess you're supposed to take care of the customer's concerns not antagonize them.  Anyways, after repeated, by what I can only describe as sheer bitchy-ness from the hostess, I left and went to the Bachi on Sahara where the service was much better.  The restaurant itself was less crowded and roomier and the hostess was much nicer (and hotter) might I add.  Giving this one star rating is still too much.
That hostess can go f*ck herself with a sharp stick."}
{"text":"I had the Miyagi which was potentially the best burger I've ever had.  I put some extra truffle sauce on it because I like a lot of condiments but without the sauce the burger was still great.  The service was spectacular, waiter came by every 5 mins or so and asked if we needed anything.  The price was about as much as Gordon Ramsey's Brgr but Bachi tasted much better. Overall, this was a very satisfying experience.  I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"The ultimate gourmet burger. This spot is cute, and the menu is well thought out. I always want to try something new, but I'm so addicted to the Crusty Crab, it's what I've ordered each of the five times I've been there; and it's been incredible every single time. Their fries and aoli sauces are equally incredible. 
My friends usually order something from the turf- and everyone who has ever been with me has raved about their selection. This place is a local gem."}
{"text":"Best burger place ever, even for the not-burger-fan! their burger rocks BIGTIME! my 3 faves.....fish bachi, miyagi, and mr.HO. Just a quite a bit of wait for your food but totally worth it. So don't go there when you're hungry-hungry, maybe just a little hungry :)"}
{"text":"Service was great as well as the food presentation and taste. Fish sandwich is delicious!"}
{"text":"Onolicious!  We indulged!  All the reviews mentioned are absolutely correct.  Now if they'd open up in Southern California. :-)

Your mouth sinks into the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries and a Kiki Burger and as my husband described it was \"mouth watering orgasmic\".

Great food altogether and look forward to trying other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is different. I still like it though. The burgers are expensive and you have to pay for eat item separately. A burger might be $20, fries $5, drink $4, and a beer $5. This is just a nice place for a quick lunch or something for 2. If the prices were better I'm sure I would go there more often."}
{"text":"Saw some girl there i think her name was Erika or Angela, but she was digging in her nose before she served our food it was DISGUSTING. Never coming back here. Not only that but whoever made the burgers the night I went obviously does not know what medium well means. Don't come to this location, go to the one in henderson. Or you might end up with boogers or a uncooked burger."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Juicy & flavorful. Try the chicken wings- addictive! We also enjoyed the marrow jam. Relaxing atmosphere. Seated right away, the service could have been a bit faster but our waitress was really nice. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Need to work on their customer service.  Waited 15 minutes to be seated in a half empty restaurant.  Burgers were a disappointment after after high hopes of this place.  The appetizers were actually better.  Oxtail chili cheese fries are a must.  Pork belly steamed buns were also delicious and the wings were good as well.  The burger meat were not juicy nor flavorful.  The shogun burger did not go well together and the I tried another burger with the Taro bun and it was too sweet for the burger.  I would come back if I rented a car in Vegas."}
{"text":"Horribly overcooked burgers - what a waste of good meat. Ridiculously slow service - otherwise we would have sent the burgers back. This is my third time here - it's close to the movie theater. I won't be back."}
{"text":"There is nothing more to say than if you are looking for some fresh new flavors in a very cool vibe place you must go here! One of my favorites is the Ox Tail fries! Don't forget to add extra sauce and share with a friend as these are almost a meal in themselves."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is not . 
I love their Bahn Mi burger . My son likes the  pork belly in a bun."}
{"text":"I've had four different burgers here and they've all been delicious.

As for appetizers, I definitely recommend the oxtail chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Service was good. Reasonably priced. It's a cute, clean place. We were able to split our check between three people without any hassel or trouble, so I don't know what that other review saying they weren't able to is about."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it is consistently one of the best burgers around!

Positive - Fun atmosphere. Amazing burgers. Try any of them! The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are the best! They always have some new menu items and appetizers that are worth trying as well. 

Negative - None so far!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries with an Asian influence. Very busy spot so expect to wait. The parking is also difficult. Make sure to order fries with the burger and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you want slow, mediocre, inconsistency, but used to be an amazing restaurant Bachi burger is for you. 

This was an amazing place to explore with your culinary taste buds, but the last two times have been riddled with poor service and poor taste. Three burgers ordered medium and three different versions of medium came out.  Our oxtail chili cheese fries had an overcooked egg and undercooked French fries. We asked for a redone egg and one only ever so slightly came back. 

We had an order of fries that came out after I was two bites from done and my sister was half way through her burger. Another reason why all the acclaims and rewards are from years past on the wall. 

The flavors for the most part were all very good though. The Kiki, the bahn mi burger and the miyagi san all are excellent takes on burgers, even with the meat not cooked well. 

I want to love bachi again, I hope to love bachi again but until I hear something has changed I won't be back"}
{"text":"Delicious and unique Asian spin on burgers. Try the pork belly buns and oxtail chili cheese fries. Just found out one was just opened 30 min from our home. We will be eating there too."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life. Bahn Mi burger-- totally unique -- if you like Vietnamese flavors this burger is for you. Comes with jalapeño toppings and an amazing dipping sauce with fish sauce flavors. 

Also the oxtail fries are totally unique and rich. 

All in all -- I wish this joint existed in my home town. I usually don't even eat burgers, but I'll back. New reason to visit Vegas!  

Great beers on tap too."}
{"text":"Excellent first couple of dinning experiences at Bachi burger.  I especially liked the sweet potato fries, kalbi burger, pork buns and portuguese doughnuts with coffee gelato.  Menu selections included innovative burgers, drink, and desert selections.  Service was great by a waiter that reminded me of Jimmy Fallon.  Additionally, the bathrooms were squeaky clean."}
{"text":"We were disappointed in this place. I have no idea why they are so highly rated here! The waitress was fine, but everything else was a fail. You couldn't pay me to come back.

The menu: at least at the time I am writing this they didn't have their menu online so we had no way to gauge it or see the prices. When we showed up we were shocked to find an overpriced a'lacarte menu. I'm talking $16 for a burger, $5 for fries, $4 for a drink. They sure are proud of these things, so I am expecting the best tasting food of my life. NOPE! 

The food was underwhelming. It was not bad per se, but not even in the top 50 burgers of my life. Not to mention, the portions are actually small. $16 for a plate with a McDonald's sized burger and nothing else. No fries.

I was in a party of 5 and each person's food came out at different times, like 10 minutes apart.. So we basically got to watch each other eat. FAIL! Can't cook more than one plate at a time? WTF!?

The environment was nothing at all. Tvs on the wall that were OFF. I regret wasting our weekly restaurant visit at this place."}
{"text":"I was here in November 2010, and really liked the food.  We had take out because when we walked in we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table then another 35 minute wait for the food.  Bad enough my brother in-law refused to try the food here because it's owned by the Watada brothers.  One being Ehren the military officer that refused to go to Iraq. 

We returned in March with our grandchildren (4 y/o).  We could hear some guy in the back just screaming and cursing.  It made our gkids very uncomfortable.  We got out of there as fast as we could.  On our way out I joked that I hope it's the owner throwing his tantrums back there and doesn't tolerate that behavior from an employee.  The person I asked laughed and said yes it is...

Like I said, I liked the food, the the atomsphere they provide sucks ass!"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Vegas. 

I have eaten here for about 2-3 years. I love it and I recommend it to all of my friends.

It has not always been perfect, but they fix it when there is a mistake, they treat there customers well. And overall it's the best burgers I have had in Las Vegas. Much better than Holstein's where I recently got food poisoning. 

Their fries are some of the best I have ever had. Just ask for the Salt & Pepper Fries that have jalapeno peppers, cilantro and ginger and come with Garlic Aioli. 

Their normal burger is really good and I also like their Ronin Burger. 

If you like a burger that's not quite well done but more than medium ask for \"medium +\" It took me a while to learn that.

I'm not big on raw meat in my burgers but I don't like then cooked until dry so Medium + is the ticket!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. I have had great meals here time after time. I am from San Francisco and this reminds of a place I might frequent back home -- they're just with it on many levels. The Bahn Mi burger is amazing, and they're burger with the Kimchi is amazing too. The only criticism I have is that sometimes the sauces are a little too sweet, but it's a small complaint. My taste buds are still thanking me and my meal was hours ago."}
{"text":"This is one of the places that I've been dying to try on my trip to Vegas. I first heard about this place when I was watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Like usual, Guy was on point in his decision to visit this restaurant. Bachi Burger has so many burger and other food options available. I got Kiki's burger and I have to say I eat a lot of burgers and this is a top 3 burger of all time for me. It was cooked perfectly (mushrooms galore and beautiful carmelized onions) and assembled so well that nothing fell off the burger or out of the bun. I also had the oxtail fries, which melted in my mouth. Oxtail needs to be cooked for a very long time or in a pressure cooker and Bachi does it right. I love how the fuse together food genres like Hawaiian and American, Jamaican and Asian. I cannot wait to try another burger. They will not disappoint. Overall, service is fast with a Nice wait staff. Prices are a little above average but these burgers are gourmet. I only have one issue with the restaurant. While there is a kids menu, it won't satisfy all kids. Burgers with fried eggs are more upscale and may be too eclectic for some kids and adults. In total, 4.5/5 stars. (Wish there was a half star button.) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bachi is always great, the Black and green burger with a sunny side up egg, Oxtail chili fries awesome... Allan was also great..."}
{"text":"I only order the Bahn Mi burger and kalbi burger, just because they are both so good enough to make my mouth water thinking about them. For the size, quality, and flavor of the burgers you definitely get your money's worth.

I can't comment on the dining experience here since I always call in my order and get it to go, but have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"My crusty crab burger tasted extremely fishy.  My husband thought that maybe they hadn't changed the oil, or it was rancid.  When our guest how is a professional chef mentioned that he thought the crab might be spoiled, Kelly the waitress ignored us after that. Nobody acknowledged our complaint in any form, then we saw Kelly drop a utensil on the floor, pick it up, and proceed to deliver it with the order to table.  She also had the hostess deliver the check to the table--I guess she didn't have the nerve to face us again, after the complaint.  It wasn't her fault the food was rotten, but it was her responsibility to deliver the complaint."}
{"text":"This place was great until we tried to pay. The server became very rude and tried to make us order extra while we were waiting for our bill, she then gave us multiple dirty looks until we left. Also, my friend got food poisoning here from the onion rings. The burgers are expensive and average. Not the best place to eat."}
{"text":"Arrived to an almost empty restaurant and waited 10+ minutes for someone to finally greet the crowd of 15+ people at the door. Then to be told we are super busy and we can make a waiting list. Absolute disappointment. Very I under staffed and unprofessional."}
{"text":"2nd visit.   It is okay.  Got a burnt waygu beef Burger... They tried cover it up with loads of sauce which made the soggy.  Service is average, I went on weekday evening time so there was no line.  I wouldn't go again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. We had pork belly buns, oxtail chile fries, shogun and spicy miso burgers. All are must have!"}
{"text":"Going here is always a hit and miss. The food is pretty good, some of it is over-rated though in my opinion (like the oxtail fries or the pork belly buns.  Try the muscovy duck buns instead. Totally under-rated in comparison and super delish). I've had every burger on the menu and my favorite is the kalbi burger with a slice of Swiss cheese cooked mid-rare.  The best fries in the house are the garlic salt n pepper fries with a substituion on the sauce to be the sun-dried tomato aioli. If you are able to request for a server, ask for Ana. She'll take great care of you and make sure to answer any questions you have with patience!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. waitress would come once every 30 mins making our experience 1.5 hrs long. Only thing redeemable about this place is the burger. They were also out of their special lobster roll which was advertised in the front."}
{"text":"This place is dope-- diverse selection on the menu of quality fusion food, pop electronic dance music, and really nice and attentive staff. Our waitress was Kaitlyn whom was genuine and nice and we had the Mr. Ho burger and the Ronin burger which were super flavorful. I'm a foodie from LA, so this was up to par! Try it."}
{"text":"The food here is awsome! I ordered a kalbi burger with homemade kimchi and my boyfriend ordered the ronin which he loved. We also order an assortment of pickles veggies, ff with pineapple ketchup and sausages with mustard. I would def come back to bachi burger. So why not more stars? I don't think I saw our server smile once the whole time we were there. She acted like the last thing she wanted to do was be there. But other then that everything was amazing :)"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have Bachi Burger finally on this side of town!!  Great service, great drinks that you don't see other places and the burgers and fries?  Wow okay the best!   The Truffle Parmesan Fries with the Sun Dried Tomato dipping sauce was so good. I can't wait to try their other fries that sounded great too.  Had the burger and the meat is so good. The tastes that all come together really create an amazing burger.  Must try!  Heard they are going be on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives on Food Network and I can see why!"}
{"text":"We went here for a late Sunday afternoon lunch - no wait.  Waitress was very nice.  I had the Ronin Burger and it was delicious.  My husband had the Korean BBQ Steam bum which was good too.  My kids enjoyed sweet potatoes fries and chicken karage.  My favorite was definitely the Ronin Burger, so tasty!  We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I had to go 5 Stars BUT barely. Been here 4 times in the last 2 weeks. Yes, It's that good. The burgers are simply fantastic, and are in the conversation for best burgers in all of the valley. Highlighted by the KiKi burger and Parmeasan truffle fries. In addition try the Jasmine Strawberry Lemonade!! It really doesn't taste like lemonade, more like tea. But very unique and refreshing!"}
{"text":"When we went there, there was no wait line... I think it was on Wed around 3pm? There were only 4 groups of people and the atmosphere was quite chill. I see some people complaining about the customer services, but I thought they were pretty pleasant. It did take quite some times before our food arrived, but they say good things happen to those who wait. 

I ordered short rib seamed bun, and my bf ordered spicy miso. We were both happy with the food we've got; just, I thought my steamed bun tasted much better with miso sauce instead of yuzu horse radish aioli. We also ordered Truffle Parmesan Fries which was interesting and creative. It was our first time, and this place has a big menu, so I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Bomb ass burgers!! Always get the miyagi burger!! Fresh off the grill!! nom nom nom!!"}
{"text":"Love the concept! Great atmosphere. Wasn't impressed with the food :(
Had an app of pickled veggies  -  small and had a strange flavor other then vinegar. My fish sandwich was greasy. Loved all the names and flavors described in the sauce it came with but they didn't deliver. Maybe too much yuzu and not enough of the traditional Asian flavors I love... ginger etc. Even the truffle fries (how can that be bad?) Were not quite right. Will try again but may take some experimentation to find something great."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite burger place ever.  such  an awesome mix between asian and american culture.  Some of these burgers are to die for, and don't get me started on the parmesian fries!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  I always get the Kiki burger.  So freaking good. I honestly haven't tried any other burger! I get the truffle fries with that too and it's always a winner for me.  The meat itself is perfect and grade a. Very creative dishes there and it's a fun casual environment for everyone including kids."}
{"text":"Preface: I wlll give the food 5 stars. This was our 2nd time at this restaurant. Excellent food. Especially the Miyagi-San. Wow! The Wagyu beef is excellent. So as far as the food, some of the best burgers I've had.
This recent visit was kind of strange. I believe our waitress was trying to be sneaky by casually getting my kids to order extra toppings on the burger. My kids didn't realize that each addtl topping cost $1.50-2.00. She asked my son if he wanted \"everything\" on the burger. He said yes. But I immediately stopped that transaction and politely said that he will only add the cheese. I can only imagine that my bill would've been $20/burger. I don't know if she was annoyed that we only ordered water; thus lowering our bill and her potential tip. I don't know. Only speculating.
Well, I will give the service 3 stars, but since the food was excellent I decided to give a 4 star rating. I really do like this place. I was just a little perplexed by her motives."}
{"text":"They listened! How awesome!!!!!! That is so admirable! I really respect a place that knows good advice when they see it and change what isn't working. They put the lobster roll on a bun and now it's a \"lobster bun\" and it is so delicious!!!! Good job Bachi Burger! Now if you would just bring back the delicious homemade pop-tarts we can talk."}
{"text":"The Asian take on burgers is really unique. But this place actually delivers on the taste too. It's not just a trendy spin on a burger joint. I hope they open lots more of these locations in CA because I happened upon it during a trip to Vegas. As others say, the chili fries are amazing- super crispy fries and a good ratio of chili, cheese and sauce. I had the Bachi fish sandwich and it was perfectly cooked fish...the Hawaiian buns are fluffy and light, but still hold up to the burger and sauce that ooze out."}
{"text":"Saw this on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives. Had to go. Nice ambience and service was excellent. Our server was patient and she knew the menu very well. We ordered the Ronin, Turkey/Chicken burger and the Fish sandwich. Meh. Each of the main ingredient was dipped in a teriyaki-soy mixture prior to cooking. It was too sweet for all of us. The Bread/Bun was excellent, more of a sweet hawaiian bread. I wish I could rate it higher but the price verse quality/quantity doesn't work out (IMHO). 
While in Vegas, its worth a try though."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong ordering any kind burger. Hehe. .. although I always seem to order the same thing,  Bahn Mi burger. You gotta order the oxtail fries, which is great for sharing! Mr. Ho burger is also awesome & so is Ronin."}
{"text":"I am not really  burger guy, but this place makes the most delicious burgers! Go early or late (open till midnight) cause it does get busy and as per every American restaurant they will take your empty plate away asap (Europeans hate that, wait untill everyone is finished cause we wont leave quicker anyway). I ordered the Ronin burger, honey had the Kiki burger, we also ordered pepper-salt-garlic fries (very good) and a fois grass appetizer (nice presentation). 
The buns were soft, caramelized onions were sweet, Angus beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce on it was special. They have a lot of great soda drinks too. 
Felix the waiter knew his menu and was very helpful in helping us to select. We'll be back but not too soon cause my calorie intake yesterday was a bit too high!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, burger was so yummy.. Parmesan truffle fries- two thumbs up! Waiter was so nice & helpful, being our first time here... Atmosphere wasn't anything special but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"If you're into exotic burgers, this is definitely worth trying. I first tried their Bahn Mi burger and went back for the Black and Green. Both excellent -- but the Bahn Mi has a slight edge. I should have taken a second mortgage on my house and tried the Shogun burger at $26, but I'll leave that for my next visit to Vegas. Decor is trendy, there's a sister Ramen noodle shop next door, service is friendly. They also make to-go."}
{"text":"The stars are solely for the food.  The Grass fed burgers were great and the sweet potato fries were some of the best I've ever had.  That is where the positives end.  The server while apologizing for bad service when he passed our table continued to provide bad service.  The French fries came 5 minutes before the burgers.  After the burgers were delivered we were never checked in again.   Another server refilled our ice tea.   I would understand if they were super busy but this is what it looked like in my servers area...."}
{"text":"Bachi=botchy! 

We were excited to try their burgers, but in the end everything was really messed up.  I think because we were confused who was our server and they were confused whose table it was yadi yada.  It could have been a quick lunch but in the end it was quite exhausting flagging one waitress down, then another, then another.  Botchy!

Food wise here's the review! 

*Oxtail chili fries - everyone else likes it, but I say 6/10.  Are you suuuuure it's oxtail? We didn't have much meat on ours plus I like oxtail because of the gelatinous-y texture and it didn't have any of that.  Also, our egg was well done...we needed a runny yolk to make this mission successful.  Fries tasted alright, kinda like McDonalds.  

*Fish burger - really salty!  I think 6/10.  By the time I was hitting my last few bites, i just couldn't do it.  My tongue was numb.  But the bun was uber soft, uber pillowy.  Nice.  

*Mr Ho burger - hubby rates it 8/10.  The lup cheong and mushrooms tasted really rich and complemented the patty well.  As for me, I thought my first bite of his burger was far too sweet.  

*Strawberry lemonade 10/10!  Fresh, tart, not too sweet.  I could drink gallons of this.  

*Cherry Yuzu soda 10/10!  Same as above! 

So wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but from the airport it was a 5 minute drive and close to Tarjay so it's useful that way."}
{"text":"Miyagi-San burger was just incredible."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I ordered Miyagi-san's Wagyu burger and it was the bomb. My bf ordered Pork Belly bun and he said it was delicious. I luv this place and the people that works here are friendly. Best burger ever!!!"}
{"text":"The most creative burgers with flavor to match! Asian-american fusion at its finest."}
{"text":"BEST burger I've EVER had, and I've had my share of gourmet burgers. I've been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it on TV, and I finally had the chance to do so recently.

Food: I got the BANH MI burger, and it was seriously the best burger I've ever had. My mouth is literally watering as I think about it right now. It was so flavorful, and I liked how it tasted with and without the dipping sauce on the side. 

Service: Was quoted a 30-45min wait time for a Sunday around 1pm, ended up waiting about 65min. Sadly, we just got there at the wrong/peak time. A family that came in about 50min after us was seated only 10min after us. The waiter wasn't very attentive. 

Overall, the food was so good that it overshadowed the mediocre service. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"highly recommended to eat a burger. i bet everything is good... this was my first time but for sure will go back and try the rest in their menu. ronin burger was extraordinary... fries was great and the dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable local spot!! If you haven't been, you must go. Oxtail Chili Cheese fries are amazing. Any of the burgers of course. Pork Belly buns. Mmmmmm I day dream about Bachi on a pretty regular basis. Lucky to have you in my hood."}
{"text":"3.5 overall.

My boyfriend and I came shortly after they opened, so we definitely beat the rush and were seated upon entering!  That was a plus, as we were in and out within an hour.  

I noticed quite the price increase compared to the previous yelp menu photos and their provided online menu from June 2012, so I'll list the prices for the items we ordered:

1. Truffle Parmesan fries ($5.50)- I love skinny fries! These were cooked to a slight crisp, which I definitely enjoyed.  The black truffle porcini cream provided a nice savory saltiness to the fries, but the sun-dried tomato aioli really sealed the deal.  I'm not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes, but this aioli rocked my socks.. I found myself spreading it on my burger throughout the meal!

2. Kiki's burger ($11.00)- I do love me some mushrooms! I found the burger to be rather bland, even with the 3 types of sautéed mushrooms, bacon, and sweet onion marmalade.  I liked that the bacon had a slight smoky flavor, which paired well with the sweet onions and mushrooms, but I didn't care much for the garlic chili aioli.  The aioli definitely just tasted like garlic chili and mayo, and I preferred spreading the sun-dried tomato aioli on this burger to amp up the flavor.  The bun totally reminded me of cha siu bao (bbq pork buns), and upon first bite, the onions and bacon really made me think it tasted just like one..Must've been my mind playing tricks on me!

3. Mr. Ho's burger ($10.00)- The taro bun was what intrigued me!  The bun was like a taro bun from a bakery- purple and sweet! Overall, I thought this burger was really sweet and saucy.  It was a bit too sweet for me and my boyfriend, though.. It might have been due to the sweet taro bun and the sweetness of the  lup cheong (Chinese sausage).  We ended up only finishing half of this burger, but oh man! The cold leftover half (which we snacked on a couple of hours later) was so good!  I assume that the flavors settled and had absorbed into the bread while the burger cooled and dried out.. That must've also helped to mellow out the overall sweetness.  

The interior was nice.. An unfinished, modern, cool, and relaxed feel.. Service was good, music was loud, and they allowed guests to sit and have a drink at the bar while waiting for a table. I'm glad to have tried this place out, but based on the items I ordered this time, I think it's just ok.. I'll have to come back and try some other items."}
{"text":"The hamburger meat is good, although expensive since you have to order the fries separately and the service is a bit slow.  This place is for you if you have time to wait, an adventurous pallet and extra cash in your wallet."}
{"text":"I love goin to Bachi Burger. I always get the Ronin burger or kiki burger. My friends and I always go there for lunch or for a gathering. The taste of the burger is juicy and to die for. I mean c'mon, who wouldn't want to try a fried egg on their burger? yum!! :) I also tried their lychee apple soda, it is sweet, refreshing, and delish!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at both locations and food is always very good! I had lunch at the Summerlin location on Friday and food/service was excellent. I had the create your own burger and sweet potato fries--yummy. I really love the sangria. It is very light and refreshing. 

This location is very modern and is more spacious than the original. Overall, a great place to eat with a unique menu. I will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"Miyagi san burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I will be honest, I never thought an egg on a burger would be good. AMAZING! I've since tried the miso one and enjoyed it as much. We've split the oxtail fries between four adults and it was delicious and definitely something to share. Truffle fries are savory and can be shared with another person. We have brought visitors to eat here multiple times now. They have all enjoyed it and ranked the burgers on the top of their lists also."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place after hearing my friends rave nonstop about it.  And to do it right -- it was the last stop during my most recent Vegas trip!

The restaurant is super easy to find.  The decor is nice; you don't feel like you have to be fancy.  Great place for the family and seems accommodating for big groups.  Our server was great -- he gave excellent recommendations.  There was no wait, but I could only imagine.  

We ordered the truffle parmesan fries, miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger, no meat here burger, and a red velvet shake.  So juicy, lots of flavor.  I loved everything, except the red velvet shake could have been sweeter in my opinion.  But I have many sweet teeth, not just a sweet tooth =) 

I wanted the burger as rare as I could get it --- and that is what I got.  I left happy and definitely tummmy stuffed! 

I can't wait to try everything on the menu.....especially dessert.  I'll make sure to save room next time!"}
{"text":"Very upset right now. Made a 25 minute walk to bachi burger because I was craving it just to have the server tell me they closing at 9:20. Clearly said on the door they were open until 10. Don't know if he had plans for the night but that wasn't cool. Either they are false advertising or he was lying."}
{"text":"These burgers are nothing I've ever had before! We got the banh mi burger and it was ahhh-mazing. Words can't describe how good it was. Unfortunately I don't live in Las Vegas and been craving it ever since."}
{"text":"Boooo.  This place was totally overrated and not worth the money or time.  

We got to the restaurant around 1:00pm on a Sunday and they told us it was going to be about a 20 minute wait.  We put our time down with the host and went to sit down.  30 minutes later, our name still wasn't called and people who had arrived after us were getting seated before us.  I asked the host how much longer the wait was and he told me he never put our name down on the list.  He said he didn't have the correct name.  This is also after he repeated our name to us TWICE when we first got there.  There was no apology for not having our name down, and when I was asking if they put it under another name by accident, another server or host decides to butt into the conversation and tell me that she called the name of \"Alex\" about 4 times outside an no one responded.  First of all, I wasn't even talking to you, and second, my name is NOT Alex!  This was already extremely frustrating.  After being seated, the host still never managed to utter an apology for his mistake.

We sat down, drinks came pretty quickly and was greeted by the server in a pretty timely manner, which was good.  The server took our order and she had said she would bring out the food as it came out, which was totally okay with us.  35 minutes later, we still had no food.  The table next to us, a party of 6, who was sat about 15 minutes after us, who also had ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, got their order about 10 minutes after placing it.  I asked the server how much longer our food was going to be because we had already been waiting 35 minutes for the food, she said we were 2 more tickets behind and that they were really busy, so the food came out slower.  We finally got our food after 40 minutes of waiting, only for everything to come out on the table at once.  Half of the things we ordered were cold too.  So after waiting 40 minutes to get our food, we just got cold food?  Seriously?  Yeah, I didn't know that I had to pay this much money for cold food.

Here's what we ordered:

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:  meh, totally overrated.  The pictures people were posting on Yelp looked fantastic.  However, the egg was overcooked, and the oxtail chili cheese was full of beans and not really much oxtail.  

Shogun Burger:  Since the ban for foie in CA is arriving soon (which is going to be the absolutely saddest day ever), I got excited when I saw foie in this burger and had to have it.  The foie was extremely overcooked to a point where it was just grainy.  Way to ruin a great tasting food item!  The burger was cooked to a medium well, which I had asked for a medium.  

Miyagi-San Burger: This burger was definitely better than the crap the Shogun Burger.  It was tasty, but the meat was still overcooked.  Ordered medium, came out medium well.  

Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns:  This dish was definitely mediocre.  You say Peking Style Duck, and I expect Peking Style Duck.  Some crunchy duck skin, some nice meat.  Instead, the meat seemed to be stir fried in some sauce.  Not exactly what I would expect and had I known it was going to be like this, I would not have ordered it.  The taste was alright, but I definitely would not order it again.

Salt & Pepper Fries:  Fries?  How could you go wrong?  They put jalapenos inside too, which definitely made it taste better.  It came with a tomato aioli, which was tasty.  But of course, something had to ruin it.  It was cold when we got it.  I don't know about you, but after waiting 40 minutes for food, cold fries aren't going to cut it.

Overall, this place claims to have the best burgers in Las Vegas.  I'm sure there are plenty of other places you could go to to get better burgers.  This was very mediocre.  While everything sounds amazing, it really isn't.  The taste is alright, but not worth the price and definitely NOT worth the wait.  Plus, the service is absolutely horrible.


UPDATE!
There is an owner response to this review that I wrote.  However, the comment back is completely false.  I was pretty much being accused of not having tried the items that I wrote about because it wasn't on my receipt?  I've only been to this location once and I know exactly what I ordered since I went to the restaurant yesterday.  For me to be told that there are things that are inconsistent is ridiculous, given the fact that the receipt that the owner is claiming is my order, was not.  The items that is stated that I ordered wasn't even what I ordered.  It was also said the manager took our order himself.  That was also not the case, given the fact that we never even spoke to the manager once.  We had a server who took our order, just like every other table.  It is also claimed that our ticket was pushed ahead of 3 other tickets.  I think that's funny, since the table next to us, that was sat 30 minutes after us, got their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries 20 min before us.  This should again show what kind of service this restaurant provides."}
{"text":"After dozens of wonderful visits with amazing food and normally good service, I had to write about last night.  I am only rating this a 3 because of past great visits,  last night would be a 1 star visit if that.  We were seated at 5:55, waitress arrived at 5:58, I asked about the drink specials and she replied \"none\".  I knew happy hour ended at 6 so we pointed that out, her response was \"It is only a dollar off\" with an attitude.  If I had been alone I would have walked out but my daughter and her boyfriend were visiting and wanted Bachi.  At the very least I should have asked for a different server.  They ordered drinks anyway after showing the time to the waitress but I declined due to not feeling in the mood anymore plus I did not want to tip her more than I needed to.  I don't know if it was her attitude or if something was done on purpose, but our burgers were mediocre for the first time ever, and there were black hairs in our fries which we sent back.  Very disappointed and I'm not sure if we would ever go back, which is a shame because it was a favorite for sure.  I should have insisted that we just leave and go up the block to Steiners, they are always fantastic there and no attitudes.  Yes we still left a 20 percent tip because my daughter is a waitress and we know how hard the work is, but I sure did not want to."}
{"text":"\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . . . . but let me tell you about the best burger ever!\" This statement was touted among my San Diego foodie friends after a weekend of debauchery in Nevada's finest city.  Despite the meal not fitting within the parameters of fine dining and there was no full bar; we still decided to venture to Las Vegas to investigate these alleged Angus masterpieces.

J2 and I flew out to be met by Erik, Greg and Mike.  All part of the carnivorous maximus species, we have an affinity towards our bovine benefactors.  Upon our arrival at 10:00 pm we were completely famished and ready to dine.  Chef Dave and Chef Lauren, formerly Roy's culinary masters, are the brilliance behind the scenes.  The establishment was reminiscent of a Japanese sushi restaurant without the sushi.  Japanese beer, my personal favorite when I drink beer, was on the menu as well as a myriad of others for those who enjoy an ethnic variety.  Table top, Bachi Burger provides a Bamboo Sea Salt, which seems to be a basic fleur de sel with a green tint.  Leaning next to salt was a high octane spice; sliced garlic and chili marinating in water.  The aroma warned your olfactory senses of the possible impending pain that would ensue with over exposure.  Even a generous portion provided a garlic & chili taste that was so bold, the anticipated pain would have been worth it, however, somehow the spicy bite never reared itself to distract from the pureness as designed.    

Today's appetizers were two flavors of fries.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries had minimal truffle taste, however we did enjoy the texture and very light taste of the Black Truffle Porcini Cream that was drizzled across the top.  With dirty fingers and hands, more napkins had to be ordered.  (It is advised to get extra napkins ahead of time; this meal should become messy and not to be eaten in your Armani Suit.)  Salt & Pepper Garlic fries found their way to the scene, and were more traditional, with the exception of the sauce.  Garlic Chili Aioli?  Nice!  Too much of this Red Matter would definitely melt the planet Vulcan.  Although the creaminess of the aioli was soft and relaxing as silk, the Chili taste soon followed to wake your taste buds and start the party.  Add a few drops of that Garlic Chili water  . . .  now that's a tasty fry.  In retrospect, I happily noted that there was no ketchup, nor did we need it.  I would venture to guess that a ketchup request would not only be bad form but also admitting to a poor palate, so don't embarrass yourself.  

Perusing the menu, it was obvious why these burgers are so tasty; Wagyu and Angus beef are the chief ingredients.  Although grinding up a perfect Wagyu steak to make a burger struck me as a foodie faux pas, the end result was a mouthful of amazing.  My favorite was the Miyagi San Burger.  Despite it being grass fed, this bovine creation was tender and juicy.  Caramelized bacon and a fried egg provided a palate party platform that held everything together, then a juicy first bite impression of a burger unlike any other that.  A similar taste was found in the Kiki's Burger, as it also had caramelized bacon.  But in this case a thin layer of sweet onion marmalade gave an almost dessert like finish.  A few dips in the provided aioli sauce were the perfect lubricant to pair with this patty.  Combining the thoughts behind those two burgers, I believe they came up with the Ronin burger.  Again the associated unique sauces with the unique ingredients were perfectly paired, in this case Japanese Cole Slaw and Miso Goma with a Yuzu Ailoi.  Very clever, very clever indeed!  

Going towards the surf/turf part of the menu, shrimp was introduced into The Bahn-Mi Burger among other spices that offered the full flavor of curry and chili spice, again without the bite that one would anticipate after tasting such a powerful piece.  The creativity award goes to the Crusty Crab, pan roasted crab cake with Mango Chutney.  The preparation of the crab cake in itself was impressive.  The propensity to overcook and over bread the crab cake is so cliché.  In this case, minimal breading yet still firm, this crustacean cake was a divine pairing with the mango chutney.  Bravo!

I extend my compliments to Chef Dave and Chef Lauren with their creativity behind the meaty masterpieces that we devoured.  It would be unfair to juxtapose this establishment against my normal Naomi Wise trained star grading parameters, as those parameters were designed for fine dining establishments.  Suffice it to say, however, in the casual dining arena I have to write 4.5 stars all the way.  

Date Night Factor:  Messy food advisory!  Great for a casual date, don't plan on impressing your date with the culinary mess that will result.    

Bang for the Buck Barometer:  Pricey for a burger joint, but well worth it.  Two orders of fries, four beers, five burgers and coke set us back $110 with tip. 

Return to Eat Probability:  Very High"}
{"text":"I know Bachi is short for Hibachi and all, but does no one know that bachi means idiot in Cantonese?  Seriously?  My girl busted out laughing as we past this place after eating at the Japanese restaurant next door, figure we'd give it a try next time.

We ordered the ronin burger, the steamed buns with pork belly, sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries, matcha green tea, and the toffee cake for dessert.  

The ronin burger was delicious with the egg yolk over the med-rare kalbi, but the steamed buns were a bit pricey for two small pieces even though it was good.  Both fries were pretty good eats.  I'll stick with my matcha green tea smoothie from Jamba next time, the tea was too grassy for my taste.  And unfortunately the toffee cake tasted like something pre-packaged, just ok.

We'll definitely come back to try some of the other burgers."}
{"text":"Kalbi burger was bangin....

Anna the waitress....cool as the other side of the pillow....

Check...a little high for what you get but whatever

Peanut Butter/Choc shake....i dont know if its worth $6 bucks but its a damn good milkshake"}
{"text":"Who knew this place was going to be so yummy? I went once with a friend, and it was clearly okay. This may have been because of my food choice, but then I went back a second time. The second time I went back it was scrumptious! Lately I've been lessening my animal consumption and trying to be more vegan and vegetarian based. I had the No Meat Here Burger, and now I'm addicted. A must have is the SWEET POTATO FRENCH FRIES with the dressing. It's OH So Sweet! So I was thinking I would go back a third time, and maybe it would be different, just maybe my experience was not going to be the same, and I was wrong. I had the same thing the No Meat Here Burger, and again my palette was refreshed. It must have been the mushroom or something because it tasted a little out of this world. I'll be going back for the same thing. Just not a weekly thing. This is most certainly a good place to take a friend who is new to the town or never been before."}
{"text":"I am not a hamburger person, so I usually get something other than beef burger. This is alwsys delicious.  I haven't gotten anything bad yet. I am so picky with fries, and they are quality. 

The burgers are on the pricey side, but totally worth it. And they don't come with fries, but order some to share. Again, pricey when it doesn't come with the fries, but worth it. And I don't say that often....I'm cheap!! And when I say pricey....it really is reasonably priced for the average sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and can highly recommend the burgers, ramen and karabuto sausage. My new favorite is the Bachi fish.  Luscious cod fillet, grilled with a sweet glaze, served on their signature Brioche buns with a house made tartar sauce. Best fish sandwich around."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Absolutely great gourmet burgers at a decent price. Even better I don't have to go to the Strip to get here."}
{"text":"Food was good, server was great, very friendly. So was the host, but after being sat next to the ladies room I had nothing else to stare at other than bathroom traffic. Well the Saporro was going down well and I head to the ladies. A lady walking out kindly told me there was no paper towel and I thanked her for the heads up. 

I also told our server. Again noticing all the bathroom traffic I hadn't seen an employee bring in anything until about 1 later. In all fairness it was Friday rush hour, but after our meal had come and gone I had noticed a young man filling the ladies room with paper towel. Well I needed to go so I came prepped with a extra paper napkin from the table just in case. Upon entering the ladies room the very first thing I noticed was the paper towel... You could t miss it. There, lying in the trash bin was an industrial size roll of paper towel. Ewwww. Am I supposed to dry my clean washed hand with paper towel already sitting in dirty trash? That doesn't sound sanitary... So I looked to see why the man had cut this corner on a Friday night in the ladies room.  Oh that's why. There's no paper towel holder in the ladies so I guess the trash bin is were you get you clean paper towel and then also dispose of it. Yikes! What else are they cutting corners on? Sux this was my first time. This was a super bummer. To top it off. There's a print out direct from the Southern  Nevada health district, posted right above the trash bin, stating employees must wash hands after using the restroom....ugh. I'm not ok with this."}
{"text":"Went to Bachi Burger the other night in a group of 4. I have frequented this restaurant before and would give it 3 to 4 stars on those visit. This visit was different for the following reasons:

1. We were put on a waiting list with our phone number so the hostess could call us. We returned to check on our spot and the hostess said she had just called our party. The hostess before did not communicate that they were using phone numbers. (must have been a shift change). Not a big deal by itself. We had good timing and did not lose our spot.

2. Server did not introduce himself and was very cold and lacked any personality or genuine concern. While the service was not terrible it was definitely lacking. 

3. We were going to split 4 burgers. we requested that our burgers be cut in quarters so we could do this easily. The server told us her could bring us steak knives but they wont serve it cut. I asked another server and she said the same thing.

4. We decided to do one less burger since we were not able to have the burgers cut to share. We decided it would be too much of a project to try to do at our table with steak knives. Two of the people in our party were going to split a burger and the other two would have there own.

5. We asked if it was possible to get the burger that was being shared cut in half. It was a plain Jane burger and I was sure the kitchen could handle this. This resulted in a female staff member who I assume was a manager visiting my table to explain that they did not want to cut the burger because it would change the presentation(the cook wants the presentation his way) and the kitchen is really busy, \"so in order to expedite the cooking process they would prefer not to cut the burger\". This was a bit of an insult to anyone who has worked in the culinary world not to mention a paying guest.

6. The manager took a uncompromising position as I did let her know this. The server hawked over our table the remainder of the visit, most likely to try to regain any lost tip (we still tipped 20%). 

In summary, the food was good, but there are plenty of burger joints in the Las Vegas area, many of which I will visit more frequently in place of Bachi Burger. They are pricey as well in comparison to more established burger joints.

The customer service aspect and the arrogant manner in which the manager handled a simple request was what drove down this experience the most. My sister reminded me on this visit that she had previously come here and the chef refused to add lettuce to a burger because \"it would change the taste profile of the food\".

Advice to the chef: despite your enthusiasm for what YOU want, what YOU want comes second to what the GUEST wants. The guest is paying for a product as well as an experience. Without us, the GUESTS, YOU are out of a job.

Advice to the manager/supervisor: If you want to help the business grow as well as add to your professional success you will have a much easier road granting a special request rather than insulting your patrons intelligence by discussing logistics of a burger kitchen. In the time it took to give your enthusiastic lecture on expediting product from the kitchen, you might have been able to cut 20 or 30 burgers or maybe even grant a simple request to go above and beyond your current set of service standards. Instead we ordered one less burger on this visit, skipped desert and probably wont be back. YOUR JOB IS TO ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST/BRAND LOYALTY. THE GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT. WITHOUT THEM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE A JOB."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. The utensils were dirty, the glass smelled, the ox fries were tasteless. Waiting to be seated for 15 minutes with several empty tables available."}
{"text":"Had to find my old yelp account just to write this review, because we felt discriminated.

My friends from out of town wanted to try this place, so we diced to meet up for dinner.  Me and my wife arrived early,  as usual for dinner there was plenty people in line.  My wife asked for a table for 4 people.  She was told if we didn't have the full party, they can't seat us.  So me and my wife decide to wait in the car for our friends to arrive, because it was crowded at the door.  

Before I move on just to clarify (me and my wife are both ASIAN, the host for restaurant that night was a WHITE guy)

So 15minutes later my WHITE friend arrived and he went in asked for a table for 4 and got it immediately with out any questions or confirmation if he had the full party with him.  While me and my wife are still in the car.

I complained to the server and all she did was trying to make excuses for what happened and never said sorry in any sincere manner.

I was extremely upset and said i was going to post a yelp review and she said go ahead.

Normally I would of asked for a manager, but my friends were there and I didn't want to ruin the night for everyone since it was his first time at Bachi Burger. We already spend 20 minutes complaining to the server.

Me and my wife will never eat at this place ever again."}
{"text":"The only reason this got 2 stars is because I gave them a star due to the look of the place.  They spent some time decorating it and trying to have good Feng Shui and I can appreciate that. 

Ah, but the food.  It was AWFUL.  I can't remember the last time the food was SO bad.  

Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the burger I got but it was purple.  Yes, purple.  I actually thought it was pretty cool until I took a bite.  The flavor, the texture, everything about it, was just awful.  I literally couldn't force myself to take another bite.  

Some of you out there may like it but I will never, I repeat, NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"I love all things oxtail,so I was excited to try their oxtail chilly fries. It was ok but the strong and salty flavor of the chilly overcome the delicate taste of the ox tail. That was a small let down for me. One order of the fries was enough to feed both us. We also got the Kiki burger which is excellent and banh mi burger which is ok. I eat tons of Vietnamese sandwiches everywhere. I will save my money and get a real banh mi else instead. I will come back and try more burgers and the truffle fries along with dessert since they look very good. Bottom line: good quality food and hip place."}
{"text":"I had the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger and my boyfriend ordered the Kiki's Burger + truffle fires.
I loved this interpretation of the banh-mi sandwich - it makes what could be a heavy burger into something fresh. Size of the burger was perfect. We were considering sharing but were glad that we each ordered our own burger."}
{"text":"We were only a party of six, waited  over 15 minutes only to be sat in the other half of the empty restaurant where servers were taking a break. There was ample room in the main dinning room. The food was delicious and the price is right if I was also included as part of the ambiance instead of in the back to be forgotten. As we exited we were not even acknowledge by the group of employees standing at the bar."}
{"text":"best gourmet burger in town.. Crews are awesome..  nice place and always clean.. food always delicious. I am totally recommended this place to anyone.. they always have good service to us everytime we go there."}
{"text":"Very amazing place!! Asian twist on the burgers!! You have to try the poutine!!! Service is always great even though they are always packed!! Fun modern place to go."}
{"text":"I loved the bachi hlk that was here before but having it be a bachi burger is no let down. The food is on point and it's generally pretty slow so you get your food quickly. One of the best burgers in town for sure."}
{"text":"Trying the rohin and Kiki burgers, sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and starting with the tuna and chip.  The food made me sick with a stomach ache cause it was so GREAT I couldnt stop eating.  Will go back for more"}
{"text":"Definitely did not live up to the hype.  The burger was overcooked (asked for medium, got well done), fries were dry, soda was extremely watered down.  The Shishito Peppers appetizer was pretty awesome, though.

I had the Mr. Hoe's Burger.  It was tasty enough but not something to write home about.  After hearing so many excellent reviews I was let down in a big way.  There are much better burger joints in town."}
{"text":"I dine here frequently, mostly when visitors are in town.  Their burgers are consistently delicious, for lunch and dinner.  Now, here's the critique that you need to pay attention to.  I have twice dined here after 8pm.  In comparison with the lunch crew, here are the differences:

1)  Service is still good, but it's not as quick as the fully staffed lunch crew.
2)  The food tends to be more salty during the evenings.  I'm not sure if this is their intention for you to purchase more beer or a matter of preference by the kitchen.  Compare the ramen and definitely the oxtail fries."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 6 and omg we ordered so much food. An asian infusion burger place, we had to try this place out. 

Appetizers
Edamame with garlic butter and truffle oil - yummy, my fingers were so oily from it but soo good ahha
Edamame with garlic ginger and chili - I don't like spicy things and it wasn't that spicy but I didn't like but my friends did
Out of the sea salt fries with pineapple ketchup, garlic salt & pepper fries with garlic chili aioli, and truffle parmesan fries with sun dried tomato aioli, the truffle parmesan was my favorite, something about truffle that just makes it soooo flavorful and tasty mmmmm

Burgers 
Most of my friends got the ronin burger which I cant speak for first hand but they loved it
My bf got the bachi american wagyu burger - which was freaking one of the most expensive but he seemed to enjoy it a lot saying the quality of the meat was really good. He was actually savoring it and eating it slowly instead of scarfing it down like usual... or maybe he was getting full from the appetizers?
I wanted to try the crusty crab but unfortunately they took it off the menu :[[ so I got the grilled bachi fish which was yummy! The only bad thing about it was that since its cod and the fish was flaky (in a good way) the burger didn't hold, it pretty much fell apart, so I had to eat my burger with a fork ahah

The server was nice and pretty attentive, constantly filling our waters and taking away plates pretty quickly. 

We left happy, definitely will be one of our stops when we come to vegas"}
{"text":"Wow first time I came here tonight for dinner. I ordered the kalbi burger and it was everything I thought that marinade would do to add that kalbi flavor. If you ever had korean bbq short ribs then you know how this food taste when it's grilled. Sweet potato fries and sometype of aioli was very good. Also had the shrimp chips, haven't had these since I was young. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised about this new location.  The restaurant space and menu options were both larger than I had thought they'd be.  I ordered a sake sangria drink (3.5 stars) and a lobster sandwich.  My husband got one of the specialty burgers.  Each came with homemade chips.  The only thing I'd change is to note that the lobster sandwich is a cold sandwich on the menu (I was expecting it to be a hot sandwich, but it was still very good).  The staff were all very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"If you have food allergies this is not the place for you. They cook EVERYTHING on their menu in peanut oil, and this is not posted anywhere in the restaurant or on the menu. The food was under or overcooked, they cannot handle groups larger than 8 or 9. The server and all the other members of the staff were rude and uninformed when I inquired about food allergies. I would not go here again, even if I did not have allergies."}
{"text":"I live just a few blocks from this little gem. As a result of both the proximity and the deliciousness of their food, I end up here waaay too often. 
I have tried almost every burger on the menu, as well as the duck buns. I haven't had anything here I didn't like! Flavor combinations are unique and tasty. They use quality beef, so I always order burgers cooked medium and I've never had a problem. 
I suggest this restaurant to friends all the time. I have been here with my most adventurous friends, my Asian friends, my friends that don't like to try new things, friends who have lots of money, friends who have hardly any, and friends who climb on rocks. I kid you not, every person I've taken here has loved it too! 
My favorite burger is the Bahn-mi burger, but like I said, I haven't had one I didn't like!
So why only 4 stars? There has been more than once that our food took forever to come out. Also, sometimes they have a big wait at the door, but open seats. They say they won't seat because the kitchen is backed up. Lame. Hire another person. 
Only other thing I'd change is their Boba tea just has a regular plastic lid, rather than that Saran Wrap type lid that most tea places have. Sad. 
Overall, hit this place up, and if you do, I'll probably be there... Haha."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Bachi Burger the other day, and I simply couldn't be more pleased. This was my second time at this location, though my family had never been. We thoroughly enjoyed both our food and service, as well as the ambience of the location.

Shortly after we entered, we were greeted by the seating host, who kindly showed us to our table. We were seated near the kitchen, which was a real treat because we got to see where the magic happened as we waited for our food. They have a wide array of beverages, both alcoholic and not, to cater to people with all kinds of tastes. I ordered the Thai iced tea, which was simply heavenly.

We skipped out on appetizers, which--after seeing how delicious they looked--rang through as a clear mistake. The burgers offered at this restaurant are unlike any I've ever seen in my years of burger-devouring: fresh, unique, and packed full of extraordinary flavor combinations. I ordered the Black & Green burger, which was cooked and prepared to perfection; it included spinach, bacon, blue cheese, and some of the best sautéed mushrooms I've ever tasted. The bun itself perfectly complemented the burger, in both taste and texture.

A majority of the burgers on the menu unfortunately don't include fries, though their selection of fries is godly. My particular favorites are the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries. Each is served in a massive cone with some highly delectable condiments, including their homemade pineapple ketchup. I didn't have any dessert because my meal was so filling, though I'll definitely be giving it a shot when I return."}
{"text":"Oh have mercy on my soul THIS was amazing!!! We were seated right away, the service was incredible and the FOOD oh man, so good wish I had another stomach! We started with the Ox tail chili fries THAT alone sold me on the place. Then we had the Bahn-mi burger and the Ronin burger holy mother of god they were SOOO delicious. Our server came and checked on us without overly checking, which was great because we were too busy stuffing our faces! LOL we then finished off the meal with Portuguese doughnuts...the coffee ice cream was to die for. I can honestly say, THIS has been such a great food orgasmic experience that we will ALWAYS come here when we're in town! Thank you for the amazing food and service! An absolute must if your in town!"}
{"text":"There were 4 of us in our party and now that they combined the Shoke Ramen restaurant  had good variety. I had a ramen bowl, don't ask what was in it since I couldn't read the ingredients.  The waiter was a great resource. The others in the group had burgers which were very excellent and the Truffle. Fries were tasty. Price was higher than Yelp let on but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great place, their strawberry soda was amazing so was the steamed pork belly buns.   We got the Bunh mi and miso burger both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, but needs improved service...slow in a fast-paced environment, food in groups isn't consistently delivered to table. I was waiting on my meal while my friends already had finished their dinner."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here tonight and had the Miyagi-San burger, the pork belly bao, the sweet potato fries, a cocktail, and a 22 oz beer for $51. The quantity and quality of the food was superb and warranted a 5-star rating. The service however was some of the worst I've experienced. No refills on our water, no offer if we wanted another beer or cocktail when we finished the first. We were left sitting with our empty plates and glasses for almost 10 minutes before I flagged down a different server to ask for my check. I would recommend this restaurant for their delicious food but manage your expectations with regard to service so you aren't disappointed. That level of service would not fly at any of the food service operations or restaurants I oversee."}
{"text":"Had one night in Vegas and not into buffets. Found this place on diners drive ins and dives listings. Food and service were awesome. Took waiters recommendations for burgers and beer and was amazed. Fresh flavor combinations and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm from LA. We went last week on Friday ( 3 of us, after we picked our friend who's local) around 2:00 pm. We were seated immediately, put in our order, got the food quickly, good burger( had better and worse ones). I paid and we left. As walking to my car, I realised I don't have my sunglasses. I immediately walked back (within 40 seconds) and told the host I'm back for my glasses and pointed out were we were sitting (2 tables behind his podium). It was all cleaned ( I'm thinking, WOW, fast service). So he goes to the back towards the kitchen( 4-5 tables away) and talks to couple of people and returns with no glasses. So I doubted myself, I went back to the car and searched with no luck. Went back to the restaurant and asked the host to look again. He went back again, asked and returned empty. He then pulled a square plastic container and pulled a woman's glasses but not mine. He said \"sorry sir, I don't have it and no one in the back has seen ANY glasses. So I gave him my cell and asked him to call if anyone turns it in,and btw, it's PRADA ... $450. But I was so confused now that even asked my friend to we go back to his house and look there. We did, but, NO glasses. We left to gas station. As pumping, I pulled out the receipt and called the number. A lady picked up the phone and after explaining, she asked me the server's name... Haha, I looked at my receipt... \"PHYRON\" I said proudly and with high hopes. \"SORRY, NO ONE has seen any glasses\" she said. By now, frustrated and deeply disappointed,  I got little angry as it was not making sense, so I spoke slightly louder. She immediately said..\"Oh wait a second, your glasses are here\".... I was \"WOW\" I'll be there in few. 
I went back. Asked the host and he directed me to the back ( this back area is not enclosed, it's visible and open to everyone). A lady/waitress??  working on the monitor pulled my glasses from \" a square plastic container\" and gave me my glasses. I asked to see the manager and me. PEREZ??, I think, young tall guy approached who so happened  to be in the back right next to her. 
I explained to him the situation and asked him why my glasses we not found shortly after my table was cleaned, since sun glasses do not end up with the utensils , and why did I have to come back twice , call , then come back the third time. Even thought from my seat to the host and to the back is oh 40 feet. He said he doesn't know and it was a miscommunication issue at the LOST AND FOUND DEPARTMENTS. REALLY??? ..... Read that again. Man, were was I , at a department  store?? Wow, I felt lost in their lost and found department. He forgot my table was 30-40 feet from his DEPARTMENT , not 30-40 floors. 
I told him that was not cool....He said HE WAS SORRY THAT I FELT THAT WAY.... With a careless posture, standing tall, hands behind his back , and looking up then down with no eye contact to me....Amazing!!!!!! He didn't even apologise for their mistake!!!! What an unprofessional manager. And btw, I mentioned my bill with 20% tip. He asked me to come back and he would give us better service . Better service???? Shouldn't the service be at best to begin with???? I didn't know what else to tell him and left. 

Everyone, I'm not a difficult customer and I tip well.  I think who ever cleaned the table was VERY AWARE of the glass and didn't bring it out till perhaps found out that I was not giving up. 
I just think managers like him who work in good restaurants MUST be more courteous to their patrons and always remember, there is YELP and other social media reviews. If they care. We are going back this weekend to Vegas again. Wish he was pleasant and professional, i  would've recommended my friends( this time 16 of us) to go back and eat there again. Well, to be even FAIR, I hope the management reads my review and replies. 
4 star for food,the chef, and the front host.  
 1 star for the manager, waiter, and the bus-boy if there was one. 
For now, I'm glad they didn't get the chance to steal and keep my glasses."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger. I don't know what it was about you, but when I saw your sign it instantly intrigued me.

My sister's recommendation solidified my decision to give this place a try. When I went, it was during their soft opening. The waitress told me they had just opened and hadn't had a grand opening yet. Despite this little detail, the place was packed! And up till now, every time I go to Bachi, it's always full. This unfortunately can be a problem. Seating is limited and I once waited 30 minutes to get a table for 2. They did offer to put in our order so the food would be ready by the time we were seated. This also relates to a second problem I have with Bachi: the wait time for food. It takes longer than average to get your food once you've ordered it. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded. Don't let impatience ruin your Bachi experience.

Despite these few issues, Bachi Burger is awesomely delicious. I've had the opportunity to sample almost every item on the menu and everything is good. I appreciate the creativity and flavor combinations in the different specialty burgers. My favorite happens to be the Bachi fish burger (fish? at a burger place? i know...). With all the specialty burgers, I have had several family and friends choose the original bachi burger as their favorite, exhibiting that this burger joint knows how to make a good, simple, but very tasty burger."}
{"text":"This review is for my third trip to Bachi as of December 16th. This place is awesome! It was a Sunday at 1pm and there was a 15 minute wait. That should tell you something. I ordered the same items as my last two visits, truffle parmesan fries and a spicy miso burger. The fries, with the black truffle oil and tomato aioli are incredible. The burger; Angus beef, onions, shishito pepper mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese
fried egg with an apple vinaigrette on a Hawaiian sweet bun; out of this world with so much flavor. If it was an hour wait I would not mind. 

Try this place if you are looking for a great burger that is a bit different than most. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I visit Las Vegas often and have eaten at this location twice and at the Windmill Ln location once.  All three experiences have been excellent not only in food but in service.  All three times I've been with Bachi virgins.  They all leave raving, some saying it's the best burger they've ever had.

This is an account of my most recent visit.  Four of us arrived around 1:00 after hiking at Red Rock and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  Our waiter asked us if we had ever been there before.  He then explained the concept, how their burgers are cooked and some of the ingredients.  Over the course of the meal he checked in with us often but not too often.

We ordered the brussels sprouts and oxtail chili cheese fries as appetizers and each got a burger, one Ronin, two Kiki and a Lonely Bird.  Everything was delightful with one exception.  One of my friends had ordered her burger well done, and when it came it was very pink in the center.  We convinced her to send it back (she's always hesitant).  A new, perfectly cooked burger was produced in minutes, and she pronounced it delicious.  About ten minutes later, the waiter set a Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow shake on the table in front of her and said \"from the chef\".  We each in turn tried it and orgasmed right at the table.  My friend said she would like to dry hump the chef.  That is all."}
{"text":"ALWAYS HORRIBLE SERVICE. Tried to order again from this place. Smart ass answering the phone can't wait for me to finish a sentence.  Took me 8 months to try this place again and boom back to never. You guys used to be good. Your costumer service has to be the worst quickie burger has better service hands down than you. And FYI if some Asian person is trying to give them 5 stars it's because it's there friend. The owner knows there's service is shit."}
{"text":"I heard bachi burger was really good so I made my husband go with me. We were greeted and seated and it wasnt busy, water was serve immediately then waiter disappear for 10minutes, finally came to take our drink order. I got a red wine and husband got nectar beer and the waiter waited over 10minutes, came back with my wine and said they were out of that beer, so husband order a different beer. We order our food, it took them 30 minutes and waiter finally brought out the fries. The Fries were very good, but who brings out fries first without burgers? After we finish the fries then finally The Kiki burger and spicy miso burger came, they were good too, but service is horrible! The guy who came in after us got his food and finished his food before we even started on our food. Even though food was good, Husband won't go back because of really bad Service!"}
{"text":"Meh. If I could back in time I would take back the decision we made to leave the hotel we were staying at on the strip to visit here. $30 can ride each way and the food was just ok. Had the truffle fries with my burger. They were nice and crispy. Made my own burger. It was overbooked and the waiter missed half of the toppings I asked for. Ice tea was from a mix and had a weird taste. Really wanted to like this place but would go back to Holsteins or Burgr next time."}
{"text":"Been here many time, never disappointed! Great food friendly staffs, black garlic tonkasu Ramen is my favorite."}
{"text":"Best lonely bird burger!  ... It's a lot to say if a non beef or pork eater loves this place.  Great beer selection.  Good service."}
{"text":"Foie gras burger for me please  They also have yummy Korean soups here...great service from the bartender. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Just had the truffle fries and the Loco Moco. Incredible meal. Loved it! Just do not want to know the calories in that dish!"}
{"text":"The Kalbi Burger was very tasty. The fries were some of the best I ever had, but I didn't care for the pineapple ketchup. It became too sweet after a few fries. I also ordered a watermelon boba. It was awful, but since I'm not a boba expert I decided not to deduct a star like I might otherwise."}
{"text":"The food here is good, I always seem to have service issues every time I go.
I went on Friday night with some friends from out of town and the service was slow and they never brought us french fries. Just really weird to keep telling us they were coming, then they never come. The weird kicker was a manager came over to apologize and say \"oh, we will certainly remove your french fries from your bill\". Like no kidding sherlock, you refused to serve us any french fries so that is correct that I won't pay for them. Didn't make much sense to try and \"save\" our experience by not charging us for a product you wouldn't serve us.

Food great! Service is meh. There are a lot of great burger joints in Vegas so weigh your expectations carefully before choosing here."}
{"text":"Barely warm warm food, below average service, truffle fries bland, steamed pork belly rolls bland, sausage appetizer barely warm by the time it was served, did I mention below average service...that is being gracious.  Based on the menu and prices, I expected great food, above average service. Between each course I ordered, the waitress took the dirty fork and knife and placed it on the table...nice mustard stains...I cleaned the mess for her as she was oblivious.   

The people next to my table sent a burger back two times before it was medium well as requested by the lady.  They asked for a manager...while apologetic, she said the staff should do this, that, whatever, apologized again, said the staff really should have done better, but it seems to happen,  Sorry.  Come back again.

 I had to ask three times for the waitress to bring a glass for a beer.  The bill was dropped off before the dessert arrived, three people hovered six times to see if the bill was signed while eating dessert.  I spent $45 + tip for one person and did not receive anything beyond Denny's level of service.  

The Portuguese donuts were very good...the only thing I tried that was up to par.  Great concept, lousy staff training and execution.  A seriously poor execution...and the place was at about 20% capacity, plenty of staff awaiting a dinner rush....they should be in a training refresher meeting  before the rush hit.  I wanted to like it.  Three stars is really 2.5."}
{"text":"Great place great food.  Stopped by here after watching a movie at the Regal theater right next door.  Lots of burgers to try out!  I wish I had enough room in my stomach to try them all.  They also have great apps, such as fried calamari which came with 2 different but delicious sauces."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after a few recommendations from some friends, As soon as we walked in, we noticed that it wasn't too busy and assumed that we would be able to get more attentive service. When the host asked if it was just us two, he seemed to have an attitude and looked bothered. When we were seated we were given water right away and asked if we wanted anything else to drink and that's when everything went bad. 
We decided right away what we wanted from looking at the menu on line and closed our menus to show that we were ready. After about four minutes we timed to see how long it was actually take someone to notice that we were ready to order. Again, it was not very busy and a lot of the servers were just walking about aimlessly and didn't give us a second look. After 8 minutes we were just amazed that no one even attempted to ask us what we wanted. After 11 minutes of waiting my girlfriend finally asked one of the girls clearing the table if someone could please take our order. Now, I understand when a place is busy and you might have to wait a few minutes or even remind your waiter you're ready, but when you have a bunch of people in the back who give the appearance of not doing anything but chatting and just walking around is not acceptable. 
Once we finally ordered our food from our server who apologized for the wait, we thought that everything would be OK from there. Again we were wrong. We decided to try the oxtail fries, spicy miso burger, and the miyagi. The oxtail fries were alright and landed up being the only appetizing part of our meal. The miyagi burger was just OK. It was pretty greasy and I could barely taste any of the bacon. The spicy miso burger was not good at all. It was not remotely spicy and after eating less than half the burger, it started to taste really soggy. We opened the burger up and the meat was just falling apart and looked like mush. It was more rare than medium. At this point, it was about an hour that we had been there. We didn't want to send the burger back for fear of having to wait longer when we just wanted to leave. 
Finally the check came and again we waited another ten minutes before my girlfriend had to hail the waitress to ring us out. She apologized again but at this point, apologies didn't mean anything. 
We might've just come here on an \"off\" night but even off nights have some redeeming quality. I will not be coming back to this place ever and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries, friendly staff. Their sauses are great, everything was good. Keep up Bachi Burger"}
{"text":"Overall, this place was decent. The staff was very nice and attentive and even apologetic when the food didn't come out very fast.

I wish I were able to have stayed longer to enjoy it more, however I was on a very short lunch break and had to rush.

The Bison burger I had was definitely good; however I don't believe it was worth $26 for a burger, fries, a drink, tax and tip, for lunch for 1.

It seemed like an upscale, trendy kind of place that I didn't feel like it was worth the experience."}
{"text":"Food was great! Ox tail chili cheese fries is a must try! Food got to us a bit slow & it wasn't so busy."}
{"text":"This is my new burger joint!!! HAVE to try the miyagi san grass fed burger!! wil not disappoint :) yummy! my server mike was really cool about recommendations on the food and he knew his beers! definitely coming back guys!! keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Heard lots of good raves about this place, so we just had to try it before heading back to SD. We saw a line out the door when we were looking for a parking, so we had our doubts that we might have to eat somewhere else.  Upon checking in to be seated, we got a \"not\" so warm & friendly greeting from the hostess. I would describe her as one of those people who are not happy with their job...quick tip Erika, look for another profession, or at least force yourself to smile! All the other staff was smiling and just gave a great vibe, most especially Dan!..the guy behind the bar, thanks again for giving us super awesome service! While I ate, I just saw how nice of a person he is to the other customers! As for the food, it was really good! Juicy burgers and my husband just killed the plate of oxtail chili fries! The reviews from our friends were definitely spot on!"}
{"text":"\"Bachi Burger\" is a term you hear a lot around Vegas, but until you taste it for yourself, you cannot begin to imagine what \"Bachi Burger\" really means. They have a delicious Japanese fusion with their burgers and pairings. The atmosphere is modern and their presentation is minimal, which I liked.  I really enjoyed the Ronin Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. I would recommend either.

We visited on a Monday evening so we didn't have to wait to be seated. However, 
I did notice that as we ate our meal, the servers would come and clear the table as we finished. I opened my straw, they came and got the wrapper, I finished my fries, they came and took the empty stand...At first, I thought, \"man, they are on it!\", but then I noticed the wait line forming outside and realized that they were trying to hurry us out the door. I mean, I hadn't even put my napkin down before the server came and took my plate.

I understand that time is money, but when I visit a sit-down restaurant with a friend I haven't seen in a while, I expect to be able to enjoy both a good meal and conversation without feeling rushed.

I highly recommend them, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good burgers with almost great service. Will definitely be coming back again and again"}
{"text":"Oxtail Chili cheese fries with garlic aioli, need I say more? This dish was featured on Guy Fieri's DDD, which is probably why it's always crowded. I usually like my burgers to be classic burgers....none of that fancy fusion stuff, but Bachi burgers have grown on me over time. I think my love for the oxtail fries has helped sway my opinion on fusion burgers. Ooh, the truffle garlic Parmesan fries are wonderful, too!"}
{"text":"Although the food is awesome.. Customer service is horrible. We ordered take out so we don't have to wait. 5 minutes on hold to order, then you wait 20 minutes (time frame they give you) you get there and wait 25 more minutes for take out.. Unbelievable. Staff wasn't very engaging on trying to satisfy customers !"}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok. 
     
     Just felt like it was a little over priced for what they gave me. I ordered the \"Ronin\" Burger and a side of Parmesan fries. Everything is Ala Carte here so you pay for it separate. I've always felt that was a crappy thing to do for an up-charge. 
      
     My burger tasted good, but for 10 bucks you think you would of had more beef in it. I was still hungry when I left. None of the flavors really made me any kind of impression on me. Instead of ketchup they gave me what looked like tomato paste for the dipping sauce of the fries. It wasn't good.
    
     I'm a huge burger fan and I felt like this place just takes gourmet burgers a little too far. Is a burger even really Gourmet in the first place?
     
     I can see why other people like it, but for me and my simple tastes I will most likely go elsewhere,
     
     Not bad, Not good."}
{"text":"We stopped here after seeing the on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives. The atmosphere was fun, way trendy & the music was really loud! We started with the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries, they were good, but the chili was very average, kind of like you'd get out if a can. 
I had the Miagi Burger. Let me preface this by saying we are from the Midwest, we are cattle people and always have a beef in the freezer, so I KNOW good quality beef. The burger smelled. I don't think the meat was bad, it tasted fine, but the smell was so overpowering, I could hardly gag it down. I'm not sure if there was an oil on the burger or what it was, but the smell of it was too much. For what it is, I thought it was overpriced, but that seems to be the norm in LV."}
{"text":"Heard all the great thing about this place.  My first time try with a group of friends.  Waitress is is rude, we wait 40min for our food .. my burger is over cook, the buns super hard, the fries undercook.  Worst burger in Vegas"}
{"text":"I don't know how the food is because the service was so poor from the front desk girl, we decided to leave instead. She was extremely rude from the start and even took 2 calls while we waited to ask her about the takeout wait time. She did not acknowledge us, and by the time she did she already had an attitude. They need to learn a thing or two about customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef hash with fried rice. They messed up and gave steamed rice instead, so had to wait longer for my meal, so that held up my friends from eating. The corned beef was disgusting, it was all fried pieces of fat it seemed. Hardly any good meat from the corned beef hash. I feel gross and kind of nauseous from that meal. Girlfriend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, she says it was mediocre. Never had a good experience at any of the Bachi places. Won't return anymore, since I am always sickly after eating there. Fries are delicious, but those are easy to pull off on your owns"}
{"text":"We had the duck buns to start. It was ok wish the duck was cooked a little better. When it says Peking style I am thinking the skin will be crispy and fat rendered off. But it was chewy. Next I had the Mr Ho burger. Ordered it cause of the lup chong sausage. It was good wish the sausage wasn't diced as small as it was.  My hubby had the Mr Miyagi and he liked his. All I all place was nice and our waiter was awesome. One problem I had was one hostess didn't like the reviews got and was gossiping about the customer in front of customers. Really."}
{"text":"I would give more stars, but the person that answered the phone for my order (8/19/2014 7:00pm he said his name was Marquee, I believe) HUNG UP THE PHONE after I answered his question.  

He answered with the typical greeting and followed with \"can you hold please?\" Where I answered \"no.\"   

He should have just said \"please hold\" and not have asked me a rhetorical yes or no question."}
{"text":"I come to Bachi Burger everytime I'm in Las Vegas. The food A+, service A++. What more could you ask for. I've tried most of the burgers and none of them disappoint. The waitstaff here is top notch and truly make the experience wonderful."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for about a month, I finally had the chance to try the burgers. The kalbi burger was solid. The marinade was good and the burger was flavorful. I wish the kimchi were spicier, but it was great nonetheless. I also had the pepper and salt fries. These were also seasoned well. 

Bachi burger makes some great fusion burgers for a reasonable price. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem. Very casual décor and atmosphere. Ordered the Lonely Bird for my boyfriend and the Black and Blue or Black and Green for me-cant remember what it was! It had blue cheese and spinach anyway. Was very tasty. The bun was very soft and the meat melted in your mouth. Apparently my boyfriends burger was tasty too. We also had a side of Salt and Pepper Garlic fries. Very nice. Will try the oxtail ones next time - didn't want to order too much as on here, the burgers look HUGE, but in reality, they are just right, we both walked away feeling content-not too full and not still hungry, just comfortable. They also give military 10% off the bill. Will come here again to try some other options of food. Recommended."}
{"text":"Miyagi-San


    This has got to be one of my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas! A friend of mine invited me out to the Bachi Burger on Windmill a while back and was just blown away by the tasty dishes. Sadly (for me that is) the windmill location has certainly gotten a lot more popular and therefore a little crowded when I go, but not to fear! Bachi Kitchen is just as good if not better!

    As you walk into the Bachi Kitchen you're greeted by the excellent staff right away. There's never a crowd when I go so my party and I were seated right away. As you look around you'll notice a more colorful and modern decor (at least compared to the Windmill location). Our server was very generous (and I apologize greatly for not remembering your name good sir) and always made sure we were never short on drinks while answering any questions we had. Any staff member I've ever had wait for me at this location has been very patient and well-spoken. Now to the food!

    I'll only be reviewing the food that I ate of course, but first and foremost.. Ox Tail Chili Fries. A heaping helping of fries covered with Ox tail chili, cheese, jalapeños, and topped with a fried egg, this is a must for anyone that goes to Bachi. More than enough to share with a party of 4, I appreciate that they lay down additional plates to take from the pile(probably to avoid the carnage of 4 people fighting over this wonderful creation). Along with the Ox tail fries we ordered a bowl of garlic butter edamame which is incredibly addictive! We had it prepared via \"sautéed\" but either way (the other being stir-fried) is sure to please your taste buds.

   For the main course I always order the soon-to-be-famous Miyagi-San burger, made of a grass fed Wagyu burger patty, chili mayo, a fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. This heavenly creature is sure to leave you feeling full and satisfied. Seeing as I am a health nut, I like to add avocado on there as well because why not?! Probably one of the best burgers I've had, and continues to be whenever I order one.

   To conclude my first ever yelp review I have to say, if you are ever in the vegas area and want to enjoy an awesomely prepared meal with some \"not your everyday ingredients\", then Bachi Kitchen is a must! I love coming to this place for lunch, and thanks to the great staff and chefs, will continue to make the trip out here while recommending it to others.

   One last note, if you don't order the Oxtail Chili Fries, did you even go to Bachi Kitchen?"}
{"text":"This seems like a ripoff of Umami burger.  But you know what?  It's better.  And definitely more laid-back.  (And I'm risking the wrath of crazed throngs of Umami burger fans by saying that!)  I had the  Miyagi burger which was excellent.  I ate the fried onion rings off the top, so when I got to the burger it was largely pristine and it was just great: really fresh, really good quality.  I may be the only person in the world who doesn't like fries, but the others told me they were really good and tasted almost grease-less.

My only issue was it took them a long time to bring the beer I ordered.  The appetizers arrived.  No beer.  We almost finish the appetizers.  Still no beer.  Finally someone (not our waiter) notices us looking around and gets it straightened out but I mean, how long does it take to pour a draft beer?"}
{"text":"On Saturday July 25, 2015, three of us; all being first timers, came here for dinner at 6:15pm. We were seated and told our server would be w/us shortly. After watching the 2nd table, who came in after us get served drinks, and having 15 mins pass we got up to leave. Our waiter came over at that point & asked for our drink water, apparently not understanding the words w/a smile, \"no thank you. we are going elsewhere\". This place is not only off our list but our experience has been shared w/others. Pity because although a bit pricey, food being served looked good but we'll never know. Fortunately, Claim Jumper never disappoints."}

P.S Plantation sweet tea was the bomb"}
{"text":"First and last time going there. The food wasn't anything special, prices were alittle expensive for a burger joint. I mean I don't mind paying for a good burger but it wasn't good. I ordered the bachi pickles, they were okay but very little and the just fries. The just fries was good and plenty but they gave only a tiny bit of ketchup and when requesting more it cost .50 for more ketchup. The burger came about 15 minutes after we finish the fries. They were very big but didn't taste that great. I don't recomend going there. I must say I did love the decor though, very trendy, wish I could say that about the food and service."}
{"text":"After leaving Coronado Beach, I was so upset to come back to Vegas and have crap access to good restaurants. So I tried Bachi. 

The food was pretty good. I felt like I'd gained 30 pounds and blocked a few arteries after my meal, but... it's a burger joint.. I love the grass-fed option. I won't give it 5 stars, because it was a bit greasy for my liking, but nothing near 5 Guys' status. It was $39 for 2 meals. Pricey but nothing insane. Great option to have in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Again, this place did not disappoint. I highly recommend the waygui beef... It is worth the extra expense as it is grass feed beef and so tender"}
{"text":"Good food but the service was slow..I would go back for the food but not in the near future. The place was really crowded which is a good sign and was also the reason why it took 15 minutes for us to get our check after we asked for it. The food is kind of expensive for what you get and my hubby's beer was 10 bucks so do not expect that you will be walking out with under 20 dollar tab as that is what you will pay for one person"}
{"text":"After an incredible Vegas trip spending way too much money on food and partying we finally found this place on our last day which ended up being the best by far of them all. Where to start - if you like fries its just unbelievable. Sweet potato fries are usually kinda soggy but not here - crispy like regular fries. Garlic/asian fries awesome. Everything served with superb asian sauces.

Steamed buns with duck - five stars, best I've ever had, the several filipino friends at the table said the same thing. We all had burgers, again just five stars plus. If you need or want the typical bacon-n-chedder burger with mayo and ketchup (which obviously is great itself) this might not be your place. But if you're looking for what I consider the best burger ever had in Vegas or Phoenix where I,m from this is your place. Six stars!!"}
{"text":"If you go, you must try the oxtail chili cheese fries. The appetizer is more than enough to substitute for an entree and it is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"An Asian burger shop that offers fantastic flavors for their burgers and offers awesome sides. The staff is friendly.  I have been here a few times and enjoyed every burger I have tried. I have been at two different locations one on the west side and one in Henderson both were awesome."}
{"text":"Everything is so good.  Everyone at our table ordered a different burger.  My favorite was the Kiki burger.  But don't miss the appetizers--the duck and pork steamed buns were amazing!"}
{"text":"Best burger I ever ate, and the athmosphere is great as well. The special donuts they have are just an amazing way to end a super delicous cheatmeal  Coming here pretty often, great service and  great food! What can you ask more?"}
{"text":"Excellent, very creative burger and fry menu. Slow service was the only con. Ordered the crusty crab burger but was too salty for my taste. The kimchee burger and parmesan fries were excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm looking for a negative star, but they did not have it. 
Anyways I could've to given any of the star. I came in the late night before they are closed. I ordered Salted Caramel Milk Shake for (6$) and Oxtail Fries for (11$ich). I came to pick it up, yes I okay I understand it takes sometime and I am patient enough to wait for good foods. The lady ( blonde hair who looks old than the other two girls) she gave me my shake ( half of the plastic cup )  and told me that they ran out of whip cream and caramel and it does not even look like in the picture than I expect it from other reviews. I told her that this is not what I saw in the picture of yelp, but then she said mayb it was the different place, I checked on my phone and yes it said it was on windmill branch ( they have two branches) I told her its okay, its just half of the cup and I am not taking it. I would like my money back if she can so refund. The other girls said that I can put more caramel and whip cream if you want ( the blonde hair girl just said that they ran out of whip cream oh! Incredibly, now you guys have whip cream when I want to refund my money ) I was giving an attitude by two girls even tho they are trying to fix my drink, but I don't want half of cup when I actually paid for the full amount of ($6) the drink she gave me worth around 2$ I could've gotten that from fast food place and it would taste better than this. Was so disappointed and will not be returned. I gave one star thanks to the girl that do refund for me and yes I did take my food and it does not taste good at all. I would avoid at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea I what I was getting myself into when I walked in! Simply amazing, life changing burgers for real!"}
{"text":"When I want a quick burger fix, I go to In-N-Out. But because I was in Vegas, I was told that Bachi Burger was the place to check out. My friend and I dropped by and sat at the bar and looked at the list of burgers and was ready.

Because the two of us could eat, we ordered:

1 Miyagi san Wagyu burger (you really can't go wrong with any of the burgers)
1 Kiki burger
1 Parmesan truffle fries
1 Oxtail chili fries
1 Steamed pork buns (it came with three and I seriously could've had six)

And because it was my birthday, the server brought me deep fried donuts with coffee flavored ice cream.

With bellies full, my friend and I made our way out feeling good despite the $40 taxi ride from the Paris hotel to the restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in town.  Cutting edge flavors and high quality ingredients.  My favorite is he kimchi burger....never thought a burger could be that good!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best Vietnamese ice coffee!!! I love the Hawaiian omelette and the pork belly!!!"}
{"text":"Brace yourself if you come here on the weekend during lunch/dinner time. Wait could be long but moves pretty fast. Bbq pork belly steam bun is the biz. Each order comes w/ 3 sliders of steam bun with delicious soft mouth melting pork belly...it's garnished with a slice of egg, cilantro, radish and a Chinese style bbq sauce. I could eat these all day long...

Also Peking style duck steam bun. Thinly sliced duck meat in between a steam bun, veggie garnish and their bbq sauce. The bbq sauce is a bit strong, go light with it or it could overpower the meat.

Chili cheese oxtail fries. Thinly cut french fries topped with a mound of oxtail chili, cheese, peppers and cilantro. Super tasty, no ketchup needed. 

Staff is really friendly and place is clean, overall I would definitely recommend and come back next time."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I love the truffle fries and the Kiki burger. Service was a little slow, I don't blame them though, they have to do everything as I was watching. I am also in the f&b business so I like to watch how everything is done. It was kinda disturbing that I could actually hear the head chef in the expo window in the background yelling at the servers. But as I said food was amazing, next time I'll just ask for a table in the back."}
{"text":"Asian burgers.  I hear a mad scientist laughing in a kitchen somewhere.  Maybe a ninja wearing a lab coat.  I didn't think there'd be another successful fusion-ized dish after the Kogi Korean tacos, but alas they did it.  Dag gum it, they did it.

They somehow are able to capture that magical flavor of charred cow burgers, but still gently *remind* you that this is something with a twist.  And it's not just \"Oh, here's a burger with some bean sprouts in it.\"  They season and sauce so that each bite takes you somewhere.  I had the Banh Mi burger and it reminded me of Vietnamese vermicelli bowls.  I tried the Miyagi, and I felt like I was eating Dim Dum in Chinatown.  I had to look down at the plate to remember this was somehow just ground meat in a bun.

Only negative is the wait (just prepare for it), and it's pretty loud with the music, crowdedness, and everyone yelling to fight the music and the crowdedness.

A definite must-try at least once."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! It's always my first stop when I come to Vegas. There's normally a wait and the staff is not great but the food truly makes up for it. OOOh if only they will come to Houston, I would weigh a few hundred pounds!!!"}
{"text":"This pescatarian had to try the oxtail fries and they were worth it! So flavorful, tender and I want some more! The fish sandwich was perfect. It was grilled and a little on the sweet side. Tasted like sea bass. The lamb burger looked amazing even though I didn't eat it. Giant bowl of Ramen was good. Topped it off with a cherry shake with vodka! My 5 year old wasn't a fan on his chicken fingers and ended up eating the apples and carrots.  A little disappointed they charged me for extra apples and carrots but it's a business. Would go back for the fries!"}
{"text":"Get here early, or phone in your order, this location gets busy! I came here for lunch on the way out of town and we were quoted a 45 minute wait. Because I was in a rush, I placed an order to go. I wasn't really all that excited about the experience of dining in, just wanted to see how tasty the food was.

After placing the to-go order, I waited around 25-30 minutes, reasonable. 

After getting my food, I was beyond surprised. These are truly gourmet burgers. I ordered the Kiki Burger and it was delish. Also got a side of Oxtail Chili Fries. Everything was tasty, pretty expensive though. 

All in all, if I wasn't trying to save every penny, I would have loved it even more. I wouldn't say its worth it, but I wouldn't say its a rip-off, its a treat. 

Best gourmet burger i've had."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as a long time customer who will never return.  I've been eating here a couple of times a month since they opened. At first I used to go in with my family and friends, but eventually the service sucked so bad I started taking my food to go.  No big deal, as I live two blocks away, and I still loved the food. 

Recently they instituted a policy that you had to give a credit card number to place a to go order. That's right folks, you have to give your personal financial information to a nameless stranger over the phone for...a cheeseburger.  Ridiculous. 

I often pick up burgers on my way home from work, so I just told them I couldn't give a cc number since I was driving.   They were often cautiously polite, asking for reassurance that I would actually show up...for a cheeseburger.  Tonight I called as usual, and the young lady on the phone refused to take my order.  \"If you're already on your way here, then why don't you just order when you get here?\" Oh, really?

Look, I'm not going to knock the food. Despite all of the poor service and B.S., I've still been eating here for three years. It's that good. But I'm going to miss it. It's not worth it anymore.  

 I've been in the restaurant biz for twenty years, fifteen of them in Las Vegas. I know how these things work, and I can tell you that the flaws of this business are the fault of the ownership. I'm guessing it's owned by a chef, because the food, concept, and consistency of product are great. But they are clueless about how to run the front of the house. Lack of training, no supervision, (I've eaten here dozens of times and never seen anyone resembling a real manager) and ridiculous policies that no one with a clue about customer service would implement. 

It's too bad. I'll miss it. But I won't return."}
{"text":"Just left. This was our second time here. The food was still very tasty. We were disappointed with a couple of things. We looked at the menu on their website before we got seated and decided what we wanted. When we saw our bill it was six dollars more expensive. Each of our burgers were two dollars more than what the website stated as well as the fries we ordered. I guess the prices have gone up but they never fixed their prices. We also did not receive good service. The hostess was the only good service we had. She was very sweet. Our waiter seemed very confused and unorganized. He seemed to be rushing us the whole time. The service does not match the quality of food. I would still go back for the great burgers but hopefully we will get a different server next time."}
{"text":"Awesome splurge of exotic taste and flavor. Combinations used by the chef provide an explosion of taste and flavor your mouth. It awakens senses and vocabulary not commonly used while satisfying your hunger."}
{"text":"Good burger place, had some pretty good variations on burgers.  Loved the Brussel sprouts appetizer."}
{"text":"Awwwwwfuuulllllyy sloooooow service!!!

We arrived today (on a Sunday) and were greeted by a very minimal ambience. The restaurant was nearly empty and we were told there was a 15-20minute wait...hmmm. 

We decided to wait because we didn't believe it would be a 15-20 minute wait..we were wrong! We waited 20 minutes to be seated at a table that was opened the whole time we were there!!!!!! 

I ordered the custom made BBQ burger. I added Shishito peppers, avocado, and point Reyes blue cheese.  Our waitress wanted to up sale us on everything! It was soo annoying!  Fries are extra which made me upset because I love fries with my burger...i got them anyways.  

My brother ordered the onion rings. They were good I liked the Asian flare to them but the taste reminded me too much of Funyuns.  

45 minutes after ordering, our burgers finally arrived. They were not worth the 45 minute wait! Everyone at our table ordered our meat to be medium well and 3 out of the 4 burgers were rare!!!! I couldn't even eat mine because it was sooo chewy, gross. The fries were not worth the extra $3.50.  

I was disappointed how expensive everything was. And how additional toppings, fries, and so on are extra. And the slow service was insane!!! We had to give our card to another waitress because ours was off in her own world. 

 I can't say I will be back...ever.  There's too many affordable, better quality and places with way better service out there."}
{"text":"The burgers, beer and fries are very, very good. Unfortunately, the service sucks.

It's hit or miss anytime you go. This is a very popular restaurant. They've been open long enough to get their sh*t together. They just don't seem to be able to serve customers consistently. Sometimes it is fine, other visits can be a total disaster. You can experience MIA waiters, an abandoned check-in stand and delayed or confused orders. 

The poor service really puts a damper on your dining experience and will make you forget how fun the food is. You have to be strategic about your dining times so you don't get lost in the chaos."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Westside! 

Bachi delivers an amazing roster of creative and delicious gourmet burgers for your palate. Our burgers were cooked exactly as requested (not always the case in this beef town). The bold flavors and ingredients that complimented the burgers were unique and well executed. The garlic chili aoili  packs a nice punch!

Their beverage list is a nice enhancement to their food menu as well. Smart planning and thinking. The decor is pleasant, hip and relaxing."}
{"text":"Burgers are great no doubt. Staffing issues at kitchen and floor management. Orders delivered separately ranging 5 to 20 min apart. 
It's a shame. It was a great place."}
{"text":"Boba and burgers... what can be better than this!

It covers all the bases when it comes to Asian food. Finding a place like this in Vegas... money. The Wagyu Beef Burger (Miyagi) has a very nice, sweet crunchy crust on the patty. The Ronin burger on the other hand, has a softer, melt in your mouth angus patty. It also contrasts the sweetness of the sauce with something else (something i couldn't figure out because i ate it too quickly) sour.

It's not just about the burgers for me though, not like Umami burger in LA. It's about the entire experience. The fries... the fries. I believe it's the garlic fries, but it is tasty. It emanates a slight bit of heat from the peppers. The fries also seemed to be cooked with some fish oil, which makes for an interesting flavor combination with the sauce.

And finally, the boba. Chewy, and simple.

5 stars

Almost forgot... get the portuguese donuts."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week and boy, they definitely live up to the hype! I ordered the Spicy Miso burger and it was cooked to perfection, all of the sauces and ingredients worked together so perfectly! The bf ordered the Banh Mi sandwich and boy, was it satisfying! We ordered a side of Salt and Pepper Fries with Garlic Aioli and they were delicious! We are now fans! I can't wait to return and try out some of the other burgers!"}
{"text":"Just awesome. Unassuming from the outside but stellar inside. Food, service and ambiance are casually terrific. Worth every penny for this fresh, beautiful and creative food. No pretensions, just nice people serving unique food."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly tonight with a couple of friends... always drive by and noticed how good it smelled but tonight was the first time I dined in... my only regret - not coming here sooner!  I had the \"Ronin Burger\" and was blown away. We ordered garlic salt and pepper fries, sweet potato fries, shrimp chips and pickled vegetables for the table - all of which were incredible. The fries were complimented by some tasty dipping sauces and when it was all said and done I was completely satisfied and out the door for about 20 bucks (including a beer to wash it down). Great food and affordably priced... bachi burger is on my list to return in the very near future!"}
{"text":"First heard of this place from DDD and decided to give it a try since we had a rental car for this trip. It was so amazing that we came back for lunch again the very next day to try more new items! During both trips we ordered:

Pork Belly Steamed Buns: 5/5
Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger: 5/5
Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: 3/5 (I thought it tasted like plain old soggy chili cheese fries, my hubby loved them. To each his own...)
Bone Marrow Jam: 5/5
Tonkotsu Shio: 5/5
Some kind of spicy jalapeno sriracha burger that only hubby ate: he gave it 5/5"}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference & had heard of Bachi burger. Well worth the wait! Delicious food and service. A big thank you for the ride also when told a taxi back to the strip & would be 1+ hours. Can't wait to go to their upcoming locations in Southern California!"}
{"text":"We had the Kiki burger, the sausage appetizer, and a well-paired Hitachino ale.  Friendly, upbeat service."}
{"text":"Recommended kiki burger and oxtail chilli fries. Ronan and miayagi burger is also oaky to try"}
{"text":"Another spot we went to that's not off the strip. A friend of our told us about this place. We waited about 45 minutes for our seat. The place was busy so it was understandable. Once we say down, the service was great. The Oxtail fries were as amazing as super fries (California thing :) ). Definitely the food made the wait worth it. The burgers were great as well. The bun was nice and soft. The meat was full of flavored and made the way I prefer. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok, ok.. i had 3 friends raving about this place and wtf!!  Ok, the med/well burger was for sure med/raw but because the waiter never came back after we got our food. Also, they were out of 3 menu items. That is crazy to me. The fries were greasy, and the the beer temp was for sure a little warm (bottles). I am not sure about the other location but as for this one i just couldnt do more than a 2. Would have been a 1 but the host was friendy, and when the server went missing for 30 min she helped us out."}
{"text":"This place has a nice concept and it's well executed 
Trendy Asian Burger Spot 
Sit down restaurant 
It's not cheap but it's not unreasonable 

Got all the great Asian style drinks boba etc
Salt and Fries are good 
Any burger will do

Have the Malasadas it's on point"}
{"text":"Went here because of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Burgers are exotic and non-traditional. If your a traditional burger kind of person, don't bother. Burgers are juicy and very meaty. Noodles are delicious as well, next time I personally would prefer noodles over the burger. Service was so-so, hence no 5 star rating. Will go back and try something different."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place after seeing Bachi featured on television.  Service was great, people were great, but I just couldn't appreciate the fusion of Asian and American when it comes to burgers.  If I were to go back, I'd go with a typical American style burger.  Not that the food was not good, it just didn't appeal to my palate"}
{"text":"Excellent, original, and very fresh tasting. Everyone in our four person party enjoyed their meal and we each had something different. Probably the most original tasting hamburgers I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Not your standard fare by any means, but a wnderful fusion of asian flavors and the good old fashioned hamburger."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is the business, so good that i dropped in twice in one weekend. I went straight at the kalbi burger and ronin burger which are both magnificent creations that contain dope sauce like gochujang mayo and citrus yuzu aioli. The buns were reminiscent of the golden shiny bbq pork buns you get at dim sum. We also ordered up salt and pepper fries topped with garlic and jalapenos and truffle fries covered with black truffle porcini cream, both solid accompaniments. To wash it all down i opted for the hitachino ipa and the hitachino ginger brew which may be one of the greatest beverages ive ever put in my body. My mission in life from this day forth will be to destroy the remaining burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"Onolicious! Worth driving out to and waiting for!!  Love the concept, too! The freshness and made-to-order dishes were definitely noticeable!  Woke up my palate!"}
{"text":"Ono burgers! Our server Ricky was da bestest! Definitely looking forward to eating here again!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour, from 3-6 on weekdays is fantastic. $3 beers and wine, and apps on the cheap. I had a craving for a burger so we picked Bachi Burger because it's close to home. 
We ordered off the regular menu. I got the burger with kimchee and it was fantastic! The patty is HUGE, kimchee was good (although I could have used some more spice), and the bun was fluffy and filled with air pockets ready to absorb all the yummy flavors of the burger. I ordered medium rare and the patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare. This seriously hit the spot for me. The BF got a make-your-own burger with lettuce, tomato and an egg. He really enjoyed his burger as well. 

This is a great spot (one I often overlook because it's tucked away in the corner) and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I make sure I go here every time I'm in Las Vegas. The food is delicious and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I figured someone should do a write up on this small, unknown local burger joint. They have been flying under the radar for  a number of years and I just wish more people knew about them.....I kid. This place is very popular for a very simple reason. It's putting out delicious food. I finally made it there last week and I was moved. I don't need to be blown away by a meal to appreciate it, but I love it when I have an experience. And Bachi Burger is serving up a unique burger experience.

I'd seen a number of of the over 1,000 photos posted on Yelp, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order before we stepped in the door. 

FOOD:Between three of us, we ordered Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Kiki's Burger, and a Black and Green burger. All three were excellent. The high quality meat was cooked properly and was sandwiched in a a slightly greasy bun.  The star here is the flavor combinations they create with their burgers. Wow. You will pay for it (our bill came to around $65), but these were thoughtful, creative, and flavorful burgers. I see now that I should have gone for the more adventurous burgers. I can get blue cheese on a burger anywhere. Where else can I get Lup Cheong Sausage or Japanese eggplant on a burger?  Other places might have some of the same ingredients on their burgers, but I cannot imagine them doing it with as much style and creativity as the folks at BB are. I had a well crafted burger. If I'm going to pay more than $7 for a burger, I need something beyond what a Bobby flay recipe can offer me. I need an experience!

They prepare their onion rings they way I like them: sliced thin with a light batter. I didn't dare ask for ranch and betray my lack of sophistication whilst eating my $14 burger. But that is the only thing that would have made the onion rings better.

We also had fries, a house made soda (the Lychee was entirely too sweet), and the red velvet shake. Hubby fell in love with the creamy shake. 

SERVICE: Our server was a professional. This was a busy night and he (like all of the wait staff) was taking orders, serving, and busing. With all of that, he never let our drinks get too low and he checked on us a number of times during the meal. There was a gentlemen there who seemed to be a manager who was keeping an eye on the speed of service and the table turnover. I like seeing that level of care given to providing efficient service. 

AMBIANCE: Meh. The decor was nice, but there was a large party hanging out a the bar area and they created  tremendous amount of noise. But it's a burger joint. A little noise isn't the end of the world. 

OVERALL: The food was outstanding. I feel like I am ruined for other burgers. I cannot wait to return. 

Service: 5

REVIEW #50!"}
{"text":"The burgers are totally awesome! Love the Asian fusion theme. Can't wait to go beck to Vegas, I will be visiting this restaurant again...."}
{"text":"I think it's overrated. The food was good. Presentation was great.  Customer service was horrible. When we left, I asked for extra sauce to take home. The serve then gave me a container to put the sauce that I had already eaten out of with my half eaten burger. I told her there's barely anything in it. Then she said it extra charge, which I didn't mind paying for.  All she had to say was we charge extra. I told her I have no problem paying. So then she gave me a half filled sauce. I was then really upset. I felt like she acted like we couldn't afford the food. Bill was $95+$25 tips, as I walked out she didn't even say thank you. I wouldn't go back even if they offered a free meal."}
{"text":"We used to head down to Henderson from the west side just to hit this original spot. Asian inspired burgers and a complement of great sides (e.g. salt and pepper garlic fries, pork belly stand buns) make this place unique. Sometimes the time from food to table can be a bit long, but it takes time to make great gourmet food from scratch. A must try if you've never been."}
{"text":"I usually give this place a 4 or 5, but today's service was way below par. Food was still great as always."}
{"text":"Les quantités sont là, c'est généreux, MAIS... Les frites de patates douces sont pas mal mais manques de sel et de croustillant. Le burger était bon, la viande cuite correctement mais manquait cruellement de goût. Je suis surpris de manger de bien meilleurs burgers à Paris au \"frog burger\" !


Good quantities, but we're in the US so it's perfectly normal... The sweet potatoes fries were correct but salt and crispness were missing. The burger was ok, I mean the meat was well cooked but was not tasty at all. I am very surprised to eat better burgers in Paris at the \"frog burger\" !"}
{"text":"only reason i give it 2 stars is cause the food is outstanding. the SERVICE on the other hand. almost intollerable. we sat down, took almost 10 mins for someone to come to table. then we order drinks, app , meal ect. app comes. ask waiter 3 times for our drinks, app is done. still no drink. we ask another waitress for our drinks, she rolls her eyes at us lol. i have never walked out of a place with out tipping. this was the first"}
{"text":"It was mine and my husband first time eating at Bachi Burger.  We're visiting from Philly.  My youngest brother  took us out there for a late lunch.  We had 2 order of fries, jalapeño and truffle and burger for each of us.  Halfway during lunch, my husband spit out something while he was chewing on the fries, it was a TOOTH with decayed fillings.  I turned on the flashlight on my phone and started examining my husband's mouth thinking that he might broke a tooth.  It wasn't his.  We called the waitress and showed her the tooth and she said \"ewwwww\".  She took the tooth with her and asked the people who is missing a tooth.  While she was gone, the 3 of us was grossed out and don't want to finish our food.  She came back and told us that she will replace the Fries with no charge  and then later told us that she will take out 10% of our bill.  She explained to us that they order the fries from a place, I'm guessing the fries are not really fresh.  We were just all going to forget what happened. But I think people need to know.  It happened on 10/30 between 1:30 to 2:30. I didn't get the server's name but she was Asian."}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. 
Yes, i was hungry, but the burger's taste is quite special.

Me and my friend both Got the Miso Burger  - ok so it's like 11 bucks. 
Cut it in half and literally in 3-4 minutes, we were done.  It was an amazing taste for a burger.  Somewhat spicy, yet full flavor its hard to explain.  The egg was nice but the taste of the burger didn't really made the egg stand out.

We were done so fast that the truffle fries made it AFTER we finished our burger.  Truffle fries was something to try - good but the burger was the star.

Will try the ronin burger next time.  A winner!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place but I wasn't impressed. I got the Wagyu burger with regular fries. I was looking for a burger that wasn't fast food, but this was just a little too weird for me. 

I could tell the beef was of good quality (grass fed) but it had a slightly sweet sauce on it that I didn't like. It also wasn't cooked enough, but that was probably just a communication error. The fries were ok, nothing special. I asked for a drink but they were out of coke...my bill was $30. I left disappointed."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place and everything I heard was positive so I wanted to try it.  I've gone twice and enjoyed it both times.  

The main attraction here are the Asian-inspired hamburgers which fall under \"Specialty Burgers\" on their menu.  They are a little different and you will not like these if you're expecting a normal, American-style hamburger.  They do a good job of blending asian ingredients into a hamburger and the buns are a very good sweet bun.  If you want a normal, American-style burger, they do serve these as well although I have never partaken of one.  If I want a normal American burger, I will go to In N Out. You don't come to Bachi Burger seeking out something you can have anywhere which is a regular American-style burger.  You come here for something different, the Asian-inspired burgers.

The different varieties of fries they have are all very good.  I tried the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Sweet Potato fries which were both very good.  They serve them both with a special aioli.

The service I experienced on both of my visits was a mixed bag.  The main server, an asian female that I don't remember the name of, who took our order, was very good and efficient.  She was very helpful with explaining the different things on the menu while being very bright and cheerful.  The male server, who could have been the busboy, was a little slow and absent-minded refilling drinks and collecting dirty plates.  Overall, the service was good though.

I did enjoy my two meals here and the people I was with both times also enjoyed their meals.  The prices are a little high when you think you're just getting burgers but you have to remember this is a sit-down restaurant, not fast food, and they are using high-quality ingredients.  In my opinion, the prices are fair.

I would recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I would recommend the kiki burger with truffle fries and  extra dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Tired of your average burger? Check this place out...especially if you like Asian flavors. Not just for the carnivore either. Fish & veggie burgers/dishes available."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when the last time I reviewed anything, but this place is worth mentioning and telling our story.  We had a total of 4 adults and 2 kids under 3.  We ordered 3 burgers and some shakes.  Our bill was $75.00......   So if your bill is kind of high like this I wouldn't really care if the food was good (which I had last year  and it was great), and service is also great.  Service was HORRIBLE.  I understand people get busy and they need to help other tables, but this lady was rude and non helpful through our whole experience.   First off this place doesn't have anyone working the hostess stand.  This lady came out of know where and yelled at my mom and was very rude to her about how long we had to wait and that was that.  I was pissed and wanted to go somewhere else, but my mom insist we stayed.  Unfortunately we got this chick that yelled at my mom for a server!!!!

She took over 15 minutes to order our food.  People sat down after us and ordered and got their food before we even ordered.  It took forever to get our food, our drinks including a soda (from the time we ordered our drinks, she said the shakes will take a while but the fountain coke also took 10 minutes too).  Overall the food was good, but I was so pissed I ended up hating it and couldn't enjoy it at all.  I'm so mad that we went there when I already got a bad taste from the wait time and that lady barking at us.  I suggest if you want to go here, go to fuku burger.  If your going to spend $75 on 2 burgers, 1 kids burger and a salad, at least at fuku you will get better service.  Or you might not get that disgruntle employee from bachi.  Bottom line is they don't care about customer service or making their patrons happy.

{"text":"First heard about this place on Triple DDD and added Bachi Burger to my personal list of places to visit when we're in town.  Last year we visited the other location and it was wonderful.  We just visited this location and again it was wonderful.  We purposely went in the late afternoon on Thursday knowing how busy it can get and there were three parties ahead of us waiting.  Luckily there were spaces available at the bar so we chose to eat at the bar vs waiting for a table.

My husband and I shared the oxtail chili cheese fries, green and black burger and the pork belly bao.  Everything cooked to perfection and so delish...will definitely be coming back each time when we're in town."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in years.  Try the Ronin...cooked to perfect with through the roof flavoring.  Absolutely love the soft bun.  Would have given 5 stars but the service crew are slow and unorganized."}
{"text":"Asian infused restaurant, serving the best burgers in Vegas. Must try the oxtail chili cheese fries which compliments the burgers. Not only do they serve burgers but they serve boba!!! Great for satisfying the carving before 2am ;)"}
{"text":"I went to this joint back in feb 2014 and was the first of several highly-anticipated-first-timers.  Rumor has it the place was feature on \"diners, drive-in, n dives\" (I'm sure I got the name of the show with Guy F. wrong)... I will only review what my hubby and I had and experienced.
Service - 5/5. since we were one of the early arrivers: ordered, ate, and paid the tab all within 45 min
Fries with truffle and aioli sauce - 5/5. damn, it's good and fresh off the fryer.
Sweet bun with roast duck and sauce - 4/5. it was only good.  I had better at authentic Chinese restaurants.
Shogun burger (my other half's breakfast of the day) - 10/5. YES, 10/5!!! IT WAS THAT DAMN GOOD.  I was only lucky to stole a bite out of the shogun while my hubby was bz with his phone researching our next destination of the day. The $25 shogun is worth every penny! It is worth a trip back to this place just for the burger. 
Vietnamese ice coffee - 4/5. Usually when I'm hungry, everything should be better, but this didn't do it.

Overall, because of the shogun burger and the estimated mean, I gave it all the stars it deserve.  If the joint opens one up in northern Cali with the same or higher standard, I would never dine there, instead I will quit my job so I can work there as many days as I can to eat the mouth watering burger daily;"}
{"text":"Great over and over.  I've eaten in and today took out. Great burger.  Good service,  clean atmosphere with cool young staff. I ordered well done because I'm pregnant and it was correct!  Had to sub out guyere cheese for swiss and they didn't miss that either.  I can never complain about Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Great hand crafted burgers at a good price and really close to my house... Love this place will come back"}
{"text":"We have always gone and enjoyed the Windmill location, so we were a bit hesitant to try this location for the first time. The poor reviews were mostly for the long wait and short of staff, not the quality of food, so we decided to give it a try since it's close to our house. I must say that we were not disappointed at all. The staff greeted us upon walking in and seated our party of 6 within less than 5 minutes. Our server, Alex, was great and very attentive. They constantly apologized for any wait, although there was hardly any. The food was just as excellent as the other location and the atmosphere was open and inviting. We will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Grabbed a Kiki burger here last night and it was delicious. Only downside was the service.  After placing my order the wait was almost 30 minutes. The wait was almost as long to get my check.  Multiple servers looked me in the eye while I was waiting for a check but then walked on to go and talk with each other.  Don't plan on eating here quickly if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"My mom loves to come here! She raves about it on a daily bases and whenever we want to go eat somewhere she always wants to come to Bachi Burger. The service is great and the burgers and fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"The food was good the first time I tried it, but now it seems to be going downhill a bit.."}
{"text":"I am so glad to find out that the quality is maintained with their new location.  The flavor and texture of the beef used in the burger is excellent.  I also love the spicy fries with aioli.  
I have tried three different fusion burgers and still haven't hit on one that works perfectly.  My latest was the Myagi-San, complete with bacon, egg, fried onions and furikake.  The onions were a little soggy, but the bacon and egg were tasty accompaniments.  My two dining companions both received burgers that were under-cooked.  One only slightly, but the other that was to be medium-well looked far closer to medium-rare.
However, there is enough here that is being done right, to keep me going back."}
{"text":"I would go here every week if I could. Maybe every day. I love their beer selection and their burgers. There are endless combinations. I have my go-tos, like the chili edamame and the truffle fries. They're all so yummy.  I have to say, the Ronin burger is also so yummy. Decently priced always helps too!"}
{"text":"first time there  really good food and service    This location is smaller than the summerlin location, but service fast and friendly.   I would definetly recommend it to others.   Matter of fact, might go there for my birthday celebration this month."}
{"text":"Went here not knowing what to expect. The menu was a bit confusing but after our food came out, I don't think there could have been a bad choice on the menu. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere, we stopped there on the way to the airport from the Vegas strip for lunch and it wasn't crowded at that time. Good for families or large parties. It has a great variety of game changing burgers on the menu. Such creativity and really good tasting. They also have ramen and other yummy dishes. The oxtail chili fries with fried egg on top was to die for. I had the Miyaki-san burger, sooo good, I highly recommend it. Please open one in Seattle!!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but takes forever. Who ever owns this place needs to really put some work into it. It definitely needs it."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at the other bachi burger but our server, Jared, renewed my love for this place! He was very attentive, friendly, and offered some great suggestions on burgers. I'm so glad I gave it a second chance!"}
{"text":"So the last time I was in Vegas I went to the location on Windmill street. We had the best service and the best food. However this time we thought we would try this location which was closer to where we were staying. The food was great no complaints there. It was the service that lacked. My party of 10 and I were running late and I called to them know and they were fine with it. When we arrived, we still had to wait 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Mind you, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Our waiter was Marcos and he did a mediocre job at best to help my party of 10. He forgot to ask if we needed beverages, didn't clear the table off because we had dirty plates everywhere. When we were seated for a bit and he came back to the table, he asked if we were ready to order. I said yes we are, I'll go first. He dismissed me and stated we are doing appetizers first then we will order the entrees in a very dismissive rude way. I had to correct him and let him know I'm trying to order an appetizer but he rudely cut me off. From there, it was down hill. I just wish we had better service and not a server who would cut me off. It was my bday and the place wasn't busy but we waited forever for our food. I just hope this location models after the windmill location and pics up their customer service and learns how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"Have been trying to eat there every time I come to LV but the lines are so long I give up. Today was the day awesome food great service nice atmosphere and price very reasonable. Sangria was great, fusion  burgers were incredible chili garlic wings were super."}
{"text":"Duck steamed buns were incredible. Gross fatty and tough. I can't believe they were served and we had two orders of them. Pork steamed buns were decent and wings were ok. Everything was overly greasy and lacked flavor. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best burger I have had yet. Not too gourmet, but definitely a step above anything else I've had. And the truffle fries are so tasty! But you have to try the oxtail fries. They have a sweet & savory flavor to them. Just amazing food all around. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ive only been to this location a few times. It's always bad service whenever we come. We were entertaining some people from out of town. We were seated after 20 something minutes (they said 15 minutes). We saw our waitress like... 2x the entire 2 hours that we were there. Told them we had a baby with us and they didnt give us a highchair (hubby had to get it himself). The guys ordered a beer and hubby requested some beer glasses, which never came so the hubby had to get them himself. Our oxtail chilli cheese fries came and we had no utensils or napkins. We requested them but didn't get them til later. 

Gave this location 2 stars because the food was good. But I'd rather much go to the fort apache location or russell location. Better service."}
{"text":"Had the Ronin Burger.  Great beef.  Great asian flavor topped with a fried egg.  Was soooo delicious.  Had a garlic aioli on the side that was unbelievable.  They have great burgers.  Kicks everyone's burger butt!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal burgers! Had the bahn mi and the ronin! Truffle fries but have had heaps better at other locales. But again, amazing burgers... Would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"The food was great as always.  The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must.  The drinks were awesome.  Every time we visit Las Vegas we will be coming here."}
{"text":"Best burgers in VEGAS hands down!!! Miyagi is the best! Ox tail chili fries are BOMBASTIC FANTASTIC with fried egg of course...and they have a great selection of Japanese beers. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bachi Burger 5 times now and here is my take on it. This is definitely a nice place to go to for a unique tasting burger & appetizers. I mean that in a good way of course, however, the reason I am not giving this place 5 stars has nothing to do with menu items or cuisine, but rather the inconsistency of quality. It is quite obvious that they have one or two really good chefs that are phenomenal cooks, and all the others are pretty much bench players.

Now, I don't know how many chefs they have but I came to this conclusion through logical reasoning, for I couldn't imagine their star chef having such an off day that they would produce \"BBQ in the park with friends\" quality food. So, the first 2 visits were great and then one bad, one good, and the last bad. It seems that on the busy days, like on a weekend, are the best times to go which were my first to visits. The other three visits were done through the weekdays, so if you go through the week my experience has been hit or miss (but as the record stands more miss during the week). Although, if you are interested in a boba tea just shy away, especially, if you ever been to any boba place on Spring Mountain (China Town) for you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"HOLY COW. 

I have no idea where the bad reviews are coming from because bachi burger is the best burger I've ever had. It was Sunday afternoon and I was starting to regret waiting this long for a burger. My family and I waited for 45 minutes, but the moment I took a bite out of the miyagi-san burger, the pain my feet endured was history. The burger had several layers of textures to it. From the soft bun to the crispy onion rings, to the juicy burger, to the tart yet sweet sauce and finally down to the oozing goodness of the over easy egg--I am drooling as I describe this. 

Other than the burger, you must get the onion rings! In general, onion rings are tasty in almost any restaurant, but these are even tastier. The rings are battered lightly, and they're really crispy! 

As for customer service, Kelly the waitress was extremely helpful and kind to us. Our glasses were always full and she made sure we had everything we need. MAYBE the hostess had a little attitude, but it is totally understandable when people kept checking if their table was ready when she specifically said the wait would be 45 minutes. People need to either wait patiently or go to the Subways down the street."}
{"text":"Extremely good burgers and fries!!  The spicy miso burger is soooooo tasty! They also have some specialty beer that's hard to find at other restaurants."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty! The portions are good for the price. We didn't have to ask for refills on our drinks, the Hispanic lady that works there kept refilling our waters. My favorite is the Kalibi burger."}
{"text":"I always wanted to go to Bachi Burger ever since I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on TV.  

On April 7, 2015, I took my girlfriend and visited the Summerlin, Nevada location and was not very impressed with anything.  It is safe to say I was very disappointed.  

Let me first state that when I selected the lunch special (a three course meal), I was told that we were prohibited from sharing the meal.  We never eat much anyway and usually share one lunch every where we go and have never been told at any other place we could not do this.  I was instructed to add another Entry or pick another selection.  As if this was bad enough but I was hungry so I complied not wanting to embarrass my girlfriend by leaving.  Second, the assistant waiter did not know hot tea was not an option and delayed getting me a drink and eventually brought me a cold tea.  The meals came out and were burnt on one side.  I mean the crab cake appetizer and the burger.  I did not send them back since my lunch hour was almost over by this point.  We got the desert to go and it was some form of parfait that they just dumped into a to go box without any other container.  How sanitary was that.  I filled out the satisfaction survey at the restaurant and got attitude from the main waiter since I not only gave the wait staff low scores but the presentation of the food as well.  They rushed me out as quickly as possibly because they were upset.  

Do not go here unless you have no where else to go:-("}
{"text":"Theres something to be said about a good burger place.  Memories of the perfect bite and good 'ol American BBQ's.  The Nostalgia remains but there is a fresh and creative twist to these burgers.  You must go and see for yourself, but I urge you to be adventurous when you order and try to be open minded about the Ala Carte menu (hence the 3 stars), it will definitely make your bill climb but lets remember it's gourmet."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they opened a 3rd location & it's just around the corner from where I live.  I don't know what else to say but love love love BACHI. If I am going to eat a hamburger I make it a treat to go here. Mindy is the best server, she was friendly and always smiling & pleasant when she came to check on us."}
{"text":"There is nothing that compares to this place!  As a local, this is the #1 place I bring my out of town guests to and the consensus is the same every time: \"Best burger in my life!\"  I've had a chance to eat through at least 75% of the menu because everything is SO good I can't bring myself to repeat until I've tried them all.  You will never find a place that does burgers of this quality at this kind of price.  Shame on you if you're local and haven't been here...change that tonight!!  Go now!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we stopped in Vegas after we left the airport! Hands down the best burger I ever had in my life! Sorry I forget what the name of it was. But it had an egg on it! The flavor that this burger had was insane! And the perfect squishy fresh roll that housed it was awesome! We also got the Bah mi burger. The flavors in this burger were so intense! It was full of flavor and both were cooked a perfect medium. We also got the fries with pineapple ketchup which were hot and crisp! Also got the belly buns which were fresh and delicious!  The chicken strips were to die for for as well! When I'm in the area again ill def be coming back here!"}
{"text":"False advertising on the check in offer. It says 1 free beer with the purchase of a beer. After checking in, the offer says only valid between the hours of 11 PM and 2 AM. WTF! Minus 1 star for the bait and switch tactic. :( 

Anywho... burgers here are Asian fusion burgers and they taste pretty decent, albeit pretty greasy. The sauces are creamy so if you don't like thick creamy sauces then the fries \"dipping sauces\" aren't gonna be for you. Other than that, it's what you would expect a $10 burger should be."}
{"text":"Japanese flair on a bun!

The dark bamboo decor  is very reminiscent of many sushi spots in the valley, but that's where things get remixed (reee-mixmixmixmixmix)  I just remixed the remix in case your mind was blown.  

A diverse selection of beers and sakes go very well with the Asian influences on this well-executed burger joint.  They have offerings from Rogue, Dogfish Head, Sapporo, and a few other Japanese breweries I wasn't familiar with.  

A very nice waitress informed me of her favorites, and I chose to take her (and many other yelper's) advice.  My order:

Fried Chicken Appetizer - Similar to orange chicken at many Americanized Chinese restaurants, these little morsels were lightly breaded and flavored with ginger, garlic, and shoyu.  I thought these were good but I wouldn't rush to order them again.

Kiki Buger - Shitake, Enoki, and Enigii mushrooms with caramelized onions, a delicious bacon marmalade, and an aged gruyere.  A very delicious burger for sure, I got mine medium and it was cooked exactly to my request.  

**Bachi uses a soy/ponzu base with all it's burgers, so expect a \"Japanese\" flavor more than what you would get at any other Hamburger place. I thought it was very tasty, and welcomed it as a refreshing change from the typical flavors of the beef elsewhere. 


Fries w/ sea salt - Average and forgettable.  However, the fries were served with a pineapple ketchup that was delicious.  I've heard of flavored ketchups, but this was my first experience, and I'm convinced.  If you see pineapple or banana ketchup on a menu, don't listen to your friends, they're jealous, and not as cool as you are, just get it and you'll be happy.  


I see where all the hype is coming from regarding Bachi Burger.  They offer a unique approach to an American staple, and execute with the mastery of a Karate Black Belt.......HIYYAAAAA!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and friendly staff.  Peanutbutter shake is awesome.  Wasnt tha thrilled about the P donuts which seemed like they could have been more moist"}
{"text":"I tried the Extra Spicy Miso Ramen. It was really good but had an unexpected sweet flavor. We also tried the pork buns and ox tail fries. The pineapple/mint tea was AMAZING so I even got one to go. Overall everything we good. The 3 stars is for the fact that every dish we ordered was sweet. The ramen would have been a solid 5 stars if not for the sweetness."}
{"text":"Saw this on my favorite show of \"Drivers, Dive-ins,&Drives\" and had to check this place out before going into the strip. 

We started off w/ the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries based on all the awesome pics on Yelp, & these were soo delicious! The tender oxtail, chili & cheese oozing over the crispy thin fries w/chopped green onions,cilantro & spicy little kick of jalapeños on top was yummy. The chili wasn't overpowering so that was a plus for me. Definitely recommend trying!

For my main entrée, I decided to order the kalbi burger. I love korean food, so this was the perfect burger for me w/ the kalbi marinade&kimchee. Boy oh boy, I'm drooling thinking abt it! The bun was soft, the meat was cooked medium rare like I had asked, the kalbi marinade was absolutely flavorful&sweet, & the kimchee altogether added a nice crunch.

Overall, awesome first experience as the food did not disappoint. Really cool concept w/ the Asian-fusion food. Def recommend checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so looking forward to trying a burger at Bachi.  The menu looked fantastic.  Took a while for a server to arrive.  We have gluten allergies so I immediately informed the server that I would like to order my burger protein style, which was not a problem.  However, we were EXTREMELY disappointed to hear that they use breadcrumbs as filler on all their burgers except the Wagyu beef.  There is no allergen disclaimer on the menu.  The servers were not very knowledgable on allergy issues.  

Anyone who is celiac beware when you order a burger at Bachi that it is not just meat!  SO DISAPPOINTED.  We left and went to another location that offers gluten free burgers. :("}
{"text":"Kinda hidden on far end of strip mall, but sign on side of the building helps.  Excellent burgers and truffle parm fries.  Service staff is fast and friendly.  My wife really liked the lychee boba drink.  Lots of TVs -- good to watch some sports while enjoying fantastic food.  Enjoyed the Spicy Miso and Banh-Mi burgers.  Taro bun on the Mr. Ho's burger was a little different for my taste.  Excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever had!  Love the truffle fries, the pork belly bun, And the drinks are yummy, Katsushiro is my favorite drink!  We eat there about 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here! 
First off we got the edamame which we preferred the spicy over the regular, which was very delicious! 
For my entree I got the custom made burger which was fantastic! 
I also have to talk about the waitress. She was wonderful and made sure all of our drinks were refilled and the right time. She wasn't annoying also!! Made me feel very comfortable. 
I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Omg! All I can say is I hate sweet potoato frys....I COULDNT STOP EATING THEM! Everything was so delicious here. Even the cocktails!. The bread on one of the burgers actuallt tastes like blueberry bread I am definitely going back here awesome awesome!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is my hometown and I am there a few times a year to visit family. Bachi Burger was built during my last year in Vegas before I moved to Boston literally two minutes away from my house.

Bachi has the best burgers I have ever tasted in my life. Hands down. I cannot find the words to describe them. I could search the volumes of Poe and Emerson and Twain and even their brilliance combined could not do poetic justice to this burger.

I have since adopted a vegetarian lifestyle and this burger is one of the few meats I miss eating. I still insist on going to Bachi Burger every time I am home for a visit. Their salt and pepper fries (with huge chunks of garlic and jalapeno) and garlic aioli are delicious and I love to snack on them.

If you like burgers, go have a bachi burger. If you don't like burgers, go anyway. It'll make you like burgers. 

Oh, and my favorite Bachi memory? I took my boyfriend there for the first time for lunch. He and I were still hanging out at 7 pm and I asked where he wanted to go for dinner. At his request we went back to Bachi Burger. 

While waiting to be seated a man walked in and asked us if we'd ever eaten there before. My boyfriend's response was, \"Yeah, for lunch.\" The guy told us he had initially been at a restaurant down the street and asked the hostess there if Bachi was any good. She told him it was ok, but he decided to take our word for it."}
{"text":"fyi just got shut down for roaches ya'll. stay away! $15 for a burger and they aren't paying for pest control!"}
{"text":"Disappointed seeing grown men argue and the mistreatment of employees!

I was initially excited to watch the 3D episode talking about this spot and the same feeling followed me as I was on my way to the spot too but after I parked the car and was seated within 4 minutes flat it all came to a screeching halt! - I visited the spot with 2 others in which they also saw what I saw and felt awkward for being our first visit and after viewing the same episode on TV. together and venturing from Los Angeles.

Here is the stressed out drama that we encountered.
We arrived, greeted, seated, handed the menu, offered choices all going smooth with a smile from our server. Our server was \"Lisa\" she was very nice, very intoned with us and very affected by the experience we and many others were forced to watch while sitting in front of the kitchen/podium area, after placing our order for the same dishes that Guy Fieri featured on 3D we had our beer served up and then boom! \"The Stressed Out Drama\" - While sipping on our beer we encountered a tall Caucasian cook yelling at another gentlemen on the opposite side about doing their job right but what struck us as weird was watching one of them being handled to a back room because it started to get loud and some cuss words. We later found out that the people involved were the actual owners/partners of the spot, very disappointing to experience for being our first time.

After the experience we all decided to leave but your waitress, Lisa talked us down and asked us to stay and apologized for the experience and in seconds brought over our order, and although she seemed bothered about what had happened with them she still gave a wonderful smile.

I gave your location a two stars and these are the reasons why:
Yes, you have a wonderful The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger, wonderful Truffle Parmesan Fries w/ Sundried Tomato Aioli & Drizzled Porcini Cream Sauce and a knock out Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Hoisin BBQ Sauce, would've been better with a Blue Moon beer but you were out that day but all in all, the food was phenomenal, hands down!

I gave you the second star because of your server Lisa, she shined like a star 100% when you couldn't.

NOTE: to the Owners/Managers
my tiny group and I agree that although you have problems no matter how big, never! bring them to the spot and especially never! demonstrate to your patrons how negative, ignorant and disrespectful you can be towards one another and your employees not to mention the children present. You guys have wonderful food, don't taint it by your actions.

I hate doing reviews like this because I know you work hard to be top restaurant in your genre - I attempted to speak with you face to face but that went unanswered. Good Luck in your future ventures."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. I love fresh, creative toppings on my burger (and pizzas) and this burger hit the spot. Had the Ronin burger. Also the salt and pepper garlic fries were excellent, fresh, large portion. Salted Carmel toasted marshmallow shake was tasty but small for $6 and didn't have enough marshmallow flavor. Service was painfully slow (went mid afternoon so not even peak time) though all servers were friendly and we had no issues with our order. Everything was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Stop by when in Vegas and you won't be disappointed. Had the Bison burger today and it rocked !
Service on point...,
Great spot"}
{"text":"Nice concept that I never seen before, not for the ones on budget, high priced burgers but totally worthy.
I have been here 2 times and both of the times had good experience."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was delicious. We ad the Ronin burgers and oxtail chili cheese fries. I had the Miyagi burger its  delicious and has this dressing on it."}
{"text":"Disappointed.

For father's day, I was really stoked to finally get to check out Bachi Burger from all the rave reviews and being '#1 Hot on Yelp' for the past last weeks now. My expectations were high from reading 4+ 5 star reviews. 

Upon arrival, we parked near subway. There's apparently two different entrances? I don't know if the way we entered was the back or the front (near bathroom)? There was no sign that said anything. When we walked in, we waited for a \"host/hostess\" to seat us. What we didn't expect was for this guy who was sitting with his family at a table to get up and greet us! Was caught off guard at first. Thought that guy was a customer?? 

[[ Food ]] 
Appetizers - the \"Chili fried chicken\" was thebomb .com! The taste of the fried chicken with the chili, ginger, and soy sauce gave it so much flavor and kick. And! the sweet potato fries was addicting. 
Entrees, we had to try there famous Bachi specialty burgers, not no steamed sandwiches. I picked \"KIKI's BURGER\" because I thought the name was funny hahaha :x  it had sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and gruyere cheese. The bff ordered the \"KALBI BURGER\" - ground beef, green onions, kim chee, with Ko Chu Jang Mayo. We both shared half of each other's burger so that we can say who ordered the better burger haha! Well... both tasted okay. It was good, but was it OMG that's frickin good!? NO. That is where the disappointment came in. The bff didn't expect the Kalbi burger to be what it was, which is like any other burger, but a different bun. We expected an actual Kalbi in there or something?! In my opinion, I thought the burgers tasted the exact same, only with different condiments. To wash it down, we drank a CHERRY YUZU SODA - made with pure sugar cane. Not like the cherry pepsi or coke. More on the sweeter side with less carbonation. FYI - not part of the free refills.

[[ Restaurant ]]
I'm a bit confused with the whole restaurant ambiance. Too many things going on. I think for business, it would be better if they added table booths for seating rather than just regular tables and chairs. OH! and can I say that I HATE there place mats!! Those darn things kept giving me small checkered imprints on my elbows. wth. 

Overall, customer service was fair. Food was average. Food presentation needs work. Prices is not too expensive, but $8 for the \"quality\" of the burger's is pushing it. Is it worth coming back? yeah sure, everyone should go to Bachi Burger at least once. i'd probably come back later and try the others."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I've ever eaten...I stop here every time I'm in Vegas. Food is fantastic, the Wagyu burger melts in your mouth and I cannot get enough of the pineapple ketchup. Our server, Bobby, was attentive, personable, and gave excellent recommendations....he completed our Bachi experience!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting. The burger was so salty that I ate it because of the price. The only friendly server was a bus boy named Andrew. I like the menu and maybe it was just bad luck this time or maybe I was in a sour mood."}
{"text":"One of our favorite joints in Vegas...and we only ever eat a few things on the menu because we like them so much.  We always start with the oxtail poutine...because I love poutine.  The gravy/braised oxtail is rich and decadent.  The fries are crispy and well-seasoned...and the fried egg just makes it unctuous...the cilantro helps freshen it up a bit.  The banh mi burger is my husband's favorite non-traditional burger of all time because it does remind him of a banh mi sandwich...flavors balanced well, well-cooked burger patty...really good pickled vegetables and lots of fresh cilantro.  I used to love their pork belly baos, until I tried Momofuko in NYC...but they are still pretty tasty.
Service is pretty good here.  They try to push the food out in an efficient manner and the service team does take care of you.  
With all the notoriety from Diners, Drive-ins & Dives, this place has gotten much busier over the years.  Waits can be tedious during peak dining times.  We usually roll on in on our way in and out of Vegas because my husband enjoys it so much.  Thank goodness it's been during off-peak hours because our waits have never been terribly long...30 mins at the most."}
{"text":"Thanks Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for putting these guys on the map.  My husband is a burger connoisseur, and he was very excited to check this place out.

My advice to anyone coming here for the first time is to save your appetite because their portions are HUGE. They definitely have a lot to offer, and you need multiple visits to try all the stuff that looks good on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food and great service. There was a line waiting when they opened at 11am and filled up quickly! I definitely be back."}
{"text":"hoping this was the best , but the customer service was so bad ! i ordered ice tea then in 3min. ready to order . now there was only 8 people inside and notice the waiter kept going back and forth to them and just for got about me sat there for 20 min. finally came up to me and got the nerve to say \" are you ready to order !!!\" this place is the worst customer service never going back !!!"}
{"text":"2nd visit to Bachi - people, this is some damn good food ! But again, can't go 5 star cuz they need to work out the service kinks.

had a very long talk with the owner again - good guy and even with the service problems i'll keep hitting this place.  this time:

garlic/chili edamame - nice hint of lime, good flavor ( under $4) 

crab cake burger - my date had this so i only took one bite - great flavor probably better if open faced.

grilled cheese - nice grilled bread but the cheese had an inconsistent melt - 1/2 the sammie melted perfectly, the other 1/2 didn't...strange.

french fries - cheese and i believe truffle oil - excellent ! 

pork belly buns - nice flavor - buns a little too big .

portugese donuts 
cherry pop tart

The donuts = devine ; pop tart ...ok



pics added"}
{"text":"Really there should be two ratings - the vegetarian (two stars) and the carnivore (five stars).

The vegetarian burger is mushy.  Although it has decent flavor, the tofu and breaded eggplant on the bun added nothing but volume.  If I said I ate half, that would be stretching it.

The Kiki burger with wagu was killer, according to our meat eater.

The fries were delicious, sundried tomato dip and pineapple ketchup added flavor.

Waiter attentive, but rang up my check $25 over - and admitted he had done the same thing before!  SO WATCH THE CHECK."}
{"text":"In general, I'm usually not a big fan of burgers, but I have to admit this is by far one of the best burgers I have tasted for awhile. Excellent service and amazing food. A place that I will for sure come back again!"}
{"text":"Seriously! Came here during middle of the week at 1pm.  Took 10 minutes to even get acknowledged!  Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Great burger 
A bit expensive 
And a short service 
Order takes 50 min to get to you 
When you complain they come listen and then ignore what you were saying 
I give them the benefit of the doubt"}
{"text":"Made a purposeful lunch stop here as part of a long drive after seeing it on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and it was absolutely worth it!  Got the Bahn-Mi Burger and Kiki's Burger and they were both delicious.  The beef/pork/shrimp patty oh the Bahn-Mi burger was awesome and house-made fish sauce - so good!!!  Perfect balance of tangy and sweet.  I couldn't get enough of it.  Kiki's Burger was really good as well and the caramelized bacon and onion compote added a whole other degree of flavor to the burger.  May be too sweet for some people, but I loved it.  Both burgers were cooked perfectly medium and I'm sure would have been delicious on their own, but the different toppings on each made them out of this world.  I haven't attempted to get a burger since eating here because I know it won't compare.  Didn't get the oxtail chili fries or the BBQ pork buns from other reviews because we were so focused on the burgers but saw other people getting them and  they looked delicious - will have to try next time.  Definitely check out if you're in the Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time with my girlfriend here. The service was good but the food, that was amazing! We had some appetizers and I tried the Ronin Burger which was on point! The salt, pepper, and garlic fries where really good! They had this mild spice to it which left a tingly feeling on your lips. I'm for sure coming back to try more of their stuff!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Saw this on Triple D and made it a point to go and try it on our trip to Vegas. 
Since it takes a plane ride to eat here, we made sure to order and share so we could try as many different things as possible.
The burgers come on a light and fluffy bun...almost like a sweet bread and are piled high.  I was worried that these would be one of those impossible to bite burgers but once you push the top bun down, it's totally manageable.  Spicy Miso, Miyagi-san's Grass fed Wagyu, Banh-Mi, Kalbi, and Kiki's burger were all sampled.  I loved them all except the Kiki.  I don't know what it was but something just didn't agree with my taste buds.  The burgers mentioned above were so different in flavor that it's impossible to individually review them all.  Just know that they're all good and you'll just need to try them all to find your favorite.  We also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries...delicious!  The shakes are really good too.  I tried the salted caramel marshmallow.  So, SO good. 
Everything here is a little on the salty side but I like salty foods.  The wait staff was upbeat and friendly and the wait wasn't that bad.  Maybe 15 minutes. The one and only draw back is I have to get on a plane to eat here again."}
{"text":"**VEGAS MUST!** don't waste time & empty tummies on buffets/hotels. Get yourself in here! I'm a big burger person, & this has to be the best burger in Nevada (& maybe even best burger out of Cali!) 

Burgers are juicy & absolutely mouthwatering. They don't come w/ fries or a side but make sure you order the GARLIX PARM FRIES! Some complain about the bun being too \"oily,\" but trust me, take a bite first. Service can be a hit or miss here, but the food is well worth it! I ALWAYS make a trip here when I'm in town. Actually, I just recently went twice in a row because my party loved it so much! 

Faves: Miyagi, spicy miso, Kiki, Ronin, Kalbi,.. Ugh just all of them. Don't forget the garlic parm fries, oxtail chili cheese fries, & garlic edamame. Yuuum!

Gourmet burger deliciousness, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries is, as everyone mentioned, delicious.  2 of us split the fries as an appetizer and could barely finish our burgers when they arrived.

I ordered the black & green burger and it was delicious, lots of blue cheese and lots of mushrooms, so if youre a fan of those, youd love this burger.  My friend ordered the Ronin burger and she liked mine better.

Our server was great, so I'll definition return!"}
{"text":"My first visit, but not last. Excellent food. Great burgers, just don't try to order a custom burger. They'll tell you to order one of their burgers and to substitute ingredients instead. A major flaw in service and a pain in the butt.  They are slow to seat you as well. Even in an almost empty restaurant.  I'm still rating them 4 stars because that's how good the food is here.  Just pretend your in New York and you won't notice the bad service so much."}
{"text":"The black and green burger was awesome and the Parmesan fries were great , too!  On the down side, the no meat burger did not work.  It was kind of dry and pasty, and the flavor combination was unsuccessful.  All told, it was a great first visit to a place that's a bit out of the Vegas ordinary and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Came here after already having a burger for lunch at Fork and Burger.  Different expectations, so they get the same number of stars.  Bachi is the better burger.
I had the spicy miso - came out hot, flavor was great, but I think I prefer the Miyagi San.  My wife had the regular burger.  Between the 2, mine was a lot better.  Side of truffle fries were very good too.
For some reason our server wasn't on top of her game.  Tables that sat after us had food before we did.  Our burgers came out first and our server said she'd bring our fries out right away, but then she started clearing the plates from her other table first.  I had found an old gift card that I had received from this location and the server said that they didn't have the equipment to honor it.  It didn't look like this was typical of the other tables, and I've always had excellent service in the past.
I'd go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Best burgers in vegas so have to give it 5 stars, though the service can bring it down to 2 or 3 at times. They are lucky their burgers are so good since the service on several occasions would normally keep us from coming back to a place. 

Sangria used to be amazing and now it's awful, tastes like red wine , Oj and soda water. 

All the burgers are bomb. Ronin and spicy miso are our favs"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER JOINT IN TOWN HANDS DOWN!! 

Kalbi Burger with a egg on top and call it GAME OVER! 
Top it off with Salt N Pepper fries and wash it all down with a Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda. 

HURRY UP and get some GREAT FOOD @ Bachi Burger before theres a  ZOMBIE outbreak and they come and eat it all!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something outside the typical buffet or fast food. Found this place not to far from the hotel. Sweet patato fries were best I have had. Crisp and seasoned well. Burger was a little over cooked that's why not 5 starts but seasoned incredibly well."}
{"text":"It's pretty good not as much as other burger joints . Try it not by favorite . I like other burger joints better like in china town ."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries and they were very good.  My low score is because as previously reported on yelp the service was not as attentive as it should be.  I got refills of my green tea but the glass was empty for 5-10 min each time before I got a refill.  Also I ordered my burger with bacon and it did not have any bacon.  Aside from that, the burger was tasty and delicious.  I would go back even though it has limitations as noted.  If not for the items noted above, It was at least 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique. This love establishment has different types of burgers that are worth the try. The ox tail fries taste great and the service was flawless. If you are away from the strip you definitely want to stop by Bachi burger."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is the best place to eat!  From Burger to Ramen.  I always get the Bah-mi burger and garlic pepper fries.  The wait staff is Always on point!  The food is always excellent no matter how busy or slow business is.   Puts Bobby Flays burger palace to shame."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here today for lunch. Very crowded, busy day waited 20 minutes for a table and 35 minutes to get our food. My husband ordered a burger with grilled onions, cheese. Burger came with raw onions not grilled, he was told by server that he needed to order caramelized onions. Plus the staff disagreed with him about grilled vs caramelized onions. I guess they've never heard the customers always right??? I ordered mixed seasonal salad with free range chicken. The salad came and it was arugula, radicchio, sliced carrots and 4 cubes of chicken with skin on it. When I questioned the server I was told can I get you anything else. The kitchens been slammed today. I said no just charge me for the side salad. Not worth the wait!!!!!!
If you have to wait then the food/kitchen service suffers......"}
{"text":"Ok I love this place, but Damn!!! This was my fifth, yes 5TH time coming here and by far the worst. It was late night....around midnight on Sat. I was shocked and excited to see the place not maxed out for a change. Every other time I'd visited, there was a 20+ min wait. I came in was greeted and seated promptly. Then promptly ignored by the waitress. Ordered right away, but it took awhile. Then the waitress came back and asked how I was enjoying everything lmao. Took the advice of the hostess and ordered Mr Ho burger....AWFUL. Have really liked all other items I'd ordered (which is a lot!) Bahn Mi, Spicy Miso, Kiki, oxtail fries. Ordered the burger medium and when I got it (w/o my iced tea, which I had to ask for) it was completely pink ALL the way through. They called the manager, Frank over. I explained I've been there several times and always satisfied. I asked for a Bahn Mi instead. He made me feel like I was trying to pull a fast one....saying we'll just go back to what you like best. He said the burger was pink bc it contained pork. OMG all the worse. Salmonella anyone? He finally relented and I received a delicious Pork containing Bahn Mi ordered medium (WITHOUT) being completely pink."}
{"text":"WAIT TIME SUCKS. They take forever, at most, 1/4-1/3 of the restaurant was filled with customers. They took our orders quickly, but we waited about 30-35min. I understand good food take a while..but..I'll tell you more about my 'cooked' food a bit later. There were only two people in our party. 
Parmesan truffle fries are delicious. And ronin burger. My burger was a little TOO pink for medium-well. Sadly this was not the first time that happened to me at this same location. And they forgot my husbands tea completely. Service could definitely be much better. Such a shame. The only thing they do have going for them is the deliciousness of their food and ambience."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Diners Drive-In and Dives, and decided that it was something that I had to try.  Let me tell you these Burgers are worth it...awesome flavors and oh sooooooooo nom nommy!!!  Even tried the oxtail chilli fries, it was pretty good...but would rather get a second burger instead."}
{"text":"Started with drinks, all of which were good.   Moved straight to entrée Pork Steamed Buns.  Buns were amazing.  Topped it off with Parm Fries which were fantastic.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Ox tail fries definitely good. Wait can be very long at times. Tried the Miyagi and Ronin cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, long long ago, Bachi Burger used to be my favorite restaurant. How can you beat great food, great service, and a great atmosphere? I didn't think it would ever come to this, but here I go. 

The last two times I went to Bachi Burger, something was different. They changed my favorite item on the menu. I used to love their Spicy Miso Ramen. It was loaded with flavor and super authentic with \"strange\" ingredients. They changed it and quite frankly this thing is horrible. Either way, that wasn't what stopped me from going there. 

The last time I was there our waitress Theresa was so belligerently rude. We waited at the door for over 50 minutes. When we looked inside 80% of the seats were empty, but we decided to wait anyway. I asked to see if everything was okay and the really nice hostess let us know that the kitchen was running behind. We understood and just waited patiently. 

When we were finally seated we were approached by our waitress who looked at us and said \"Might as well get you some water so you can be more patient.\" Keep in mind this whole time we did not say anything. When she came back to fill out water again we told her we were ready to order. Now get this. She looked at us (no exaggeration), tilted her head to the left, rolled her eyes at us, and said \"Its going to be a minute\" and walked away. I am surprised we didn't get up and leave right there. We sat patiently waiting. 10 minutes goes by and she comes back and starts taking our order. 

My dad has a thicker Brazilian accent and had a question about the food because of health issues. She wouldn't even look at any of us when we were talking. When he tried to ask her a question she rolls her eyes again and responds with \"yep.\"

Our experience was so horrible. I don't know what is happening with this place. Im not sure if there is new management or new ownership, but someone please keep an eye and try to fix this before it continues to get worse. 

I believe I will give this place one more try. It definitely is no longer my favorite place, but I still think the food here is amazing. I hope that the last two time were just outliers and not actually the reality of what this place is turning into."}
{"text":"Came Saturday at 1:00pm. There was a 20 minute wait but there were at least 20 OPEN tables. Hostesses said they were short staffed and we couldn't even sit down. How can you be short staffed on a Saturday afternoon?!

Sat down after a 20 minute wait. Ordered chili fries (came after 10 minutes, tasty) and 3 burgers. The burgers didn't come until an hour later. I'm not exaggerating, we literally marked the time we sat down until we had a burger. 

It wasn't just us, we commiserated with people around us to determine who would get their burgers next.  One kid next to us was almost in tears and screaming \"I'm hungry!\"

This is obviously a problem w/ the management, not the wait staff. Being short staffed on a Sat afternoon and taking an hour to make a burger is a huge problem."}
{"text":"This place has the most exotic burgers.  I ordered the bahn mi burger and my husband ordered the spicy miso.  Both were cooked perfectly and the flavor combinations were amazing.  I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pork buns, oxtail chili fries and wagyu burger. The pork appetizer is three small steamed buns but it was good quality and tasty. The oxtail chili was delicious but I didn't taste furikaki. Maybe I'm mistaken but I thought it was supposed to have that. Ordered the jalapeños on the side of the fries to keep the heat down. The burgers were amazing!!!! Wish I had the stomach to have tried their soups."}
{"text":"Oh, Bachi Burger... where have you been all my years in Las Vegas? Oh, that's right, you just opened. I just wish you had done it sooner.

Let's get one thing out of the way: I hate all things Guy Fieri but a lot of people have said a lot of good things about this place so we wanted to give it a shot.

We started with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I'm not an oxtail person but I am not lying when I tell you they were delicious. Seriously rich flavor, absolutely heaven. We also had the Crispy Fried Onion Rings, which were addictive. There is no other word.

My husband ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger while I had a Bachi Burger with Swiss and bacon. The meat itself had a wonderful taste and the burgers were done perfectly. To drink we had the Thai Iced tea and a Plantation-Style Sweet Tea. My mouth is watering again thinking about the Sweet Tea.

Our waiter was awesomely attentive and it was a great experience. My only complaint would be the not-great-sounding sound system. Aside from that, I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"What can I say. The famous Bachi Burger. I love this place. Made famous by Dinners Drive ins and Dives. You will not be disappointed with the food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Simple short review. You can't go wrong here.  You get what you pay for. Order different burgers and fries and share with friends.  
It's a popular place.  Be prepare to wait a bit."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas visiting a friend and we decided to try Bachi Burger.  When we first walked in the restaurant was far from full and we were greeted immediately and asked to wait for seating. At first it seemed there was only one server for the whole restaurant and she looked overwhelmed. After a couple minutes we were seated and another server arrived and took our drink/appetizer order. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks. Our server was making drinks at the bar as well as taking orders over the phone for takeout, it was clear they were understaffed for a Saturday night.  That being said the servers were kind and highly attentive while at the table.  At this point in the experience you're probably wondering why they received 4/5. 
 The food was absolutely amazing, so good that even a decent speed of service would have received 5/5. The Salt and Pepper French Fries were outstanding. Layers of jalapeños and cilantro were complemented by a spicy but flavorful Garlic Chili Aioli. The choice of burger was the Spicy Miso Burger, honestly the best burger I've ever had. The meat was ordered medium and cooked to perfection, stuffed with flavorful onions and a hand full of shredded lettuce that provided freshness and crunch. The combination of sauces were creamy and spicy with the perfect hint of miso in the backgrounds. As if that wasn't enough there was also a fried egg, not one flavor overpowering the burger.  I finished the meal off with the Chocolate Hazelnut Malt, a must after any burger. 
Being someone who holds costumer service in high regard giving this 4 stars was difficult, but the food was just that good. All in all I will revisit Bachi Burger next time I'm in Vegas and hopefully the service has improved. Don't let that deter you from giving it a try, the food is that good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few more times, so it's time to update my review.  They have such interesting combinations that we always order one of those instead of trying to make our own.  I haven't seen these combinations anywhere else.  I've tried the Miyagi-san and the crab cake burger.  Both were delicious!  My husband always gets the mushroom burger.  I really like the fries with cilantro and jalapeno; it really adds flavor to the fries.  The burgers are really big, so I can never order a shake with burger and fries because that's way too much food for me, but I tried my friend's peanut butter shake and it was really good!  The new Summerlin location is very convenient too!"}
{"text":"Took my parents here for dinner. We've all been there multiple times. Started with the Oxtail Chili Fries, always good to share. But our drinks came out after we got the appetizer... Banh Mi, Ronin & Kiki Burgers were awesome! But service kinda sucked. It was about 6:30pm on a Thurs night and we waited 10min for a table (understandable) but they needed more servers. Minus one star for the service."}
{"text":"Vanilla shake tastes so good... by the way if the owner is watching this you need to do something about your table they're sticky"}
{"text":"I've been to bachi burger quite a few times at different locations here in Vegas and California and this was unacceptable service. There was a family ahead of us who obviously had been waiting to even be greeted. After 5 minutes a server greeted them and told them it would be another 10 minutes and told my family it would be another 15 minutes but the restaurant was half empty with enough servers to serve the customers there. Needless to say both my family and the family ahead of us left. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"My Family from Cali wanted to try this place, we definitely enjoyed it. Our waiter was friendly, food was great!"}
{"text":"Lots of different options, love that they also have the Ramen place connected as well"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here a year ago...i was septic... i ordered the nlack and green burger was sad it dint come with fries so we ordered truffle fries to share. And steemed pork buns.  THAT BURGER WAS SO DELICIOUS! !!!!! i was so fulll i barely ate my fries witch were just as good. I csnt remeber much about the steamed buns but every thing was very flavorful.  It was a bit for our bill but totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great ambience. We ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries, Miyagi-San burger, and Peking duck bao. The food came out so quickly, once we ordered, it was out in less than 10 minutes. Everything was so delicious. My mom ordered the Miyagi-San burger and it was a little too red and asked if they could cook it a little more and they reconstructed the whole burger for her with a better temperature to her liking. Will be coming back every time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Bauchi burger is really good, for me however the burger was too sweet. But overall the burgers were good and juicy. I really enjoyed the fries and the oxtail with egg and jalapeño. :) amazing place to eat and I would recommend this to people passing Las Vegas to eat here :D"}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place for months and, when I'd driven by at lunch time, there always seemed to be a line out front. Finally went to lunch there. It did not live up to the hype. A burger that was mediocre and pricey. Fries were ok, but not astounding. The staff wasn't attentive as I'd expect. They messed up not one, but two of my party's orders."}
{"text":"Ronin burger, medium rare= full of deliciousness and so juicy
Ox  tail fries, which was okay tasted just like regular chili cheese fries. But the service was TOP NOTCH, our waiter made sure all our needs were met in a quick and friendly manner. Our water cups were never empty! Excited that BachiBurger has decided to expand into Los Angeles, cant wait to try their other burgers!"}
{"text":"My burger was one of the best I have had in a long time. Delicious savory flavors and a good portion size. The prices are a bit steep, but that doesn't keep people away. The place was packed and a few people had to wait. The bar had plenty of seating. Service was decent, although they messed up my bill, but quickly corrected it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic value for quality food!  Had just about everything on the menu and loved every savory minute of it.  Is worth the 10 min. drive from the strip especially for me being from the OC where we can't get anything close to this!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. This business deserves a detailed breakdown so I will do so.

Service: 5/5.

On both occasions that I've come here, I was assisted by Bobby, a young fellow who is well educated of the food and drinks provided as well as helpful in recommendations of other burgers. He seemed dedicated to keeping your drinks filled up and letting all of the newcomers know what they're eating (it's fusion, you might find it to be a little weird). Only catch is that he did take awhile on the check, but he was the only person working the tables and you can't really blame him.

Atmosphere: 5/5

On both occasions, the place was not loud like most places seemed to be, no screaming kids, no loud conversations, no tinking and crashes of the silverware, just  unique music and a mellow atmosphere feeling. The place is clean and organized and original art is hung up on the walls throughout the restaurant. It is never overcrowded and there is never a wait on a table. 

Food: 7/5

The food is PERFECT. The bun, soft like a warm donut, the unique flavors within the buns, things like fried egg, onion, peppers and sauces. You will be caught off guard by the flavors of your food. I had the Spicy Miso burger on both occasions and was impressed both times, not to mention it looked appetizing. The garlic fries, skinny,  with jalapeno slices in it, and a hint of lime, with a side of a sauce that you don't know what it is but you can't get enough of it. It's all there. It's perfect. I can't necessarily say much, you just have to try for yourself. Just a heads up, the way they cook it is a bit weird so if you typically eat a medium cooked burger, get a medium well."}
{"text":"Interesting place to eat. Sorta the Baskin and Robbins of burger flavor spins. I had the Banh Mi burger. It was actually very delicious. The oxtail fries were different. Never thought of using oxtails for the meat in chili, but why not? However, all in all, I will likely not return because the service was very, very slow. I couldn't understand why we had to wait 20 minutes (or longer) to be served the beer we ordered. The food started coming before we got our beer. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"If I am asked what I'm in the mood for, I can't say a burger is ever in my top 10 answers. I just can't say I'm fanatical about burgers or adore the ritual of eating one per se... but when the words, \"BACHI BURGER?\" come up during the erratic game of where-should-we-eat, I'll never say no! This place just dresses up the American classic with unconventional ingredients with the Asian fusion twist -- like ox-tail meat chili, pickled vegetables, or a runny sunny-side-up egg. Everything is just so full of creative flavor that always leaves you satisfied!

FOR HER:
- The seasonal MANGA BURGER (grilled wagyu burger topped with crab & scallop dynamite, sunny side up egg, enoki mushrooms & kaiware sprouts). I also order an iced matcha green tea, which comes with unlimited refills (costs 4$). 
FOR HIM: 
- The specialty bbq burger, KIKI'S BURGER (angus beef, sauteed enoki/shitake/eryngli mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmelade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli). We also both got an order of the TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES (fries topped with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream, with a side of sun dried tomato aioli).

They have happy hour Monday thru Friday from 3pm-6pm, which includes 4$ draft beers, 5$ milkshakes (non-alcoholic), 6$ sangria, & 7$ wine/cocktails/alcohoilc milkshakes. 

They also offer ramen now as well, which I believe is connected to the restaurant just next door!"}
{"text":"Definitely an awesome burger place. I can't explain how good and flavorful the food is. Order the oxtail chill cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Service and delicious food ! I don't know the name of the burger the server recommended  but Ill tell you what whatever it was  it was scrumptious!  This place is a must try - yes it's a bit pricey but it's totally worth every penny !"}
{"text":"Latest visit made me think Yelp!  outside the front door smelled like manure.  when the front door was held open the smell filled the entire dining area.  not sure if it's a one off fertilizing thing by the neighbor or what.  the burgers are a great value and taste amazing.  the sweet potato truffle fries even better.  had a moment with the thai iced tea though... girlfriend and i both ordered thai iced tea.  they came in a glass about the size of a coke can.  after about 5 sips the glass is empty of tea but about 75 percent filled with cubes of ice.  girlfriend is not normally fussy but comments it would be nice to have a bit more tea and less ice for 4 dollars each.  i suggest we split the difference, order two more without ice and pour the new ones into our original glasses with ice.  i felt so smart until the waitress returns with two more thai iced teas hold the ice... i pour the tea into the old glass and am surprised that all the tea fits.  then i notice that the second round of teas came out in different glasses that were about 25 percent smaller.  that's the sort of thing people truly notice and wlll make someone decide not to return.  i feel like my 16 bucks for four teas was pretty poor value.  was going to order dessert but decided against it and now probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Heard this place was good from the locals so we decided to check it out on a Saturday night just before 10 pm. However, our excitement and hunger quickly turned into frustration and WTF? when the host told us the chef just closed his kitchen not too long ago. We were like wtf? You're supposed to close at 11 and it was a Saturday night with a semi full restaurant. We voiced our displeasure and left. Probably will give this place a try during lunch hours when they're actually open."}
{"text":"Waiting time is 30 minutes but wat i dont understand is there were 5 tables empty and yet they cant sit 3 people? 

It was our 1st time here, waitress is aware yet failed to introduce the menu to us. 

Burgers are great!! There were delicious and tasty. The servings were enough and price is right. 

We will definitely come back but i hope waiting time doesn't take forever"}
{"text":"the miyagi burger is the most DELICIOUS burger i've had in my life...don't be discouraged about the fried egg, (even though i like fried eggs) you can't even taste it when combined with the bacon, onion rings and whatever sauce/spices they put on it...uuhhh i want another! 

also, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent customer service. If you're looking for a great unique burger then come to this place. Although it's small it's worth the wait. And worth every penny"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place for years and finally decided to have lunch today!  The four of us all had something different and everyone loved their food. We each had a burger, I had the regular Angus burger and it was great! We shared an order of sweet potato fries and truffle fries as the portions we large....they were delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Most unique burgers I have ever eaten however extremely delish!!!! The staff was very very friendly and the service was great. The restaurant itself is clean and modern. Price is a little steep for a hamburger but the quality definitely out weighs the price."}
{"text":"Love this place, when you have no intentions to fire up your own grill, but desire a common taste with a wonderful twist: Bachi Burger is the answer! The burgers are tasty with nice ingredients and the ox tail fries make your mouth water. Highly recommend this place for the taste = price. Make sure the weather is nice if you are going on a weekend night because you will wait and it maybe outside. Keep in mind, the food is worth it and you will hopefully not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The short version: spectacular food, reasonable prices, average (at best) service that just isn't the fault of the servers. The managers and/or owners are waaaaaaaaay understaffing their floor at peak times and it hurts the experience, which would be perfect if not for the service issues.

We started with the pickled vegetables -- revelation. A nice mix of Japanese veggies that calmed the appetite but didn't fill us up. I've had both the Ronin with beef and with the chicken patty (for reduced guilt.) I loved it with both, awesome flavor combo. The fries are special. Truffle parmesan is spectacular, sweet potato not far behind.

Beware the hard sell on the drink menu, both alcoholic and non. Looks like that's where they make up for the reasonable prices on the food menu. If you want a drink, there's a great selection of sodas, beers, wines, etc., but it'll run up your bill in a hurry.

Servers are friendly and helpful, but just stressed out by being stretched too thin. There were two for the entire floor at dinner a few weeks ago and they were running for their lives. For the sake of the experience, please staff up, Bachi!"}
{"text":"I guess Triple D can be a blessing and a curse.  It's really too bad, the Windmill location is around the corner from me, and I have been a fan since I discovered Bachi last year.

Long story, short, FRONT OF HOUSE has gone straight down-hill.  Waited 15 mins before I went to the guy behind the cash register and asked him if there was a list to be seated.  I noted the dining room was 75% full, four tables were waiting to be bused, three were ready to be seated.  I brought this up to him, and he stated that the kitchen was backed up.  HUH?!  What the hell does that have to do with my party being recognized, and we would like to be seated?....or get on a list?....or SOMETHING other than the woes in the BACK OF HOUSE?

Only reason we waited another 15 mins to be seated, and not walk out, was because my brother was visiting, and I had been bragging about Bachi since he arrived.

Food was ok....definitely had better in previous experiences.

I reviewed the other 'Yelps', and agreed with most, if not all, of the complaints and compliments.  

I wish them well, especially now that the other location has been opened.  I hope they get-it-together sooner rather than later.

NOTE TO MANAGEMENT/OWNERS: If your FRONT OF HOUSE AND BACK OF HOUSE fail, individually or collectively, Bachi will go the way of the Dodo...."}
{"text":"This place is so good. You can't go wrong getting oxtail fries and Kiki burger. THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN."}
{"text":"The best burger in in town. Never had a bad hamburger form here. You must get the ox tail chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"My cousins & I were visiting Vegas over the weekend & we decided to try this place because that episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives was just haunting us. That goofy, blond guy made all the food seem so good, like best shit you will ever put in your mouth good. So I had high expectations.

We got two orders of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to share among the 7 of us & also an order of the Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns as appetizers. We then ordered our burgers and I am glad that I got to taste not just one burger, but three.

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50) - I have an obsession with fries that is pretty unhealthy. But I would not mind clogging my arteries with these fries all day, every day. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about them. The oxtail meat was tender as can be and the chili had a little kick to it which I loved. My cousins and I devoured both orders in seconds. THEY WERE THAT GOOD. Shut up and take my money good.

Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns ($12.50) - It comes with only 3 steamed buns, so my cousins & I just cut them in half. I kinda shoved my half in my mouth so fast that I didn't savor it to the point where I remembered it. I pretty much inhaled it. I remember that it was good though & that I forgot to dip it in the sauce.

ANYWAYS. Onto the good part...

Miyagi Burger ($13) - Ooooh, this burger was good. I only got it because when am I ever going to eat a waygu burger again? Probably never! The patty was medium rare and tender and oh so juicy. The fried egg dripping onto my plate & all over my burger adding an element of flavor and richness to it was the best thing ever. The onion rings were crispy and good. Is your mouth watering yet? Because mine is.

Kiki's Burger ($10) - My cousin ordered this & blessed me with a bite of it. It came with a garlic chili aioli that when spread on the burger before you bit into it tied everything together. The meat was cooked perfectly & was absolutely delicious.

Mr. Ho's Burger ($9.50) - This burger got passed my way so I took a bite. I don't know what the fuck was in it. But it was soooo good. I remember the burger being juicy and sweet.

Overall, the food met my expectations & the service was great. I will be back soon, Vegas, for those Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I wants them in my belly. Ugh so good."}
{"text":"Myagi-san burger, Truffle-Parmesan fries, and the duck steamed bun sandwich were amazing.  Apparently unlike other reviewers, we had superb service!"}
{"text":"The wait was about 35 min on a Friday night, which isn't terrible but we got it to go either way (keep in mind that we didn't have the full experience). 

In my opinion it is a little over priced since it doesn't come with fries or anything ( $15 for the Miyagi). 

We had the Miyagi-San and the Kiki's. The burger came  cooked more medium rare than medium but it was not a big deal. The sauce on the Miyagi was definitely the best part. It was perfectly sweet while still allowing you to taste the burger. 

If you are worried about the egg in your burger, don't you worry; it is amazing. The egg provides another great dimension of taste and texture. 


The to go service was mediocre but I understand on a busy night it is hard to provide excellent service to take-out customers. 

I would eat it again. Top 10 burgers I have ever had. Oh yeah the fries are really good (they are like pomme frites)."}
{"text":"We started out with the oxtail chili cheese fries. These were quite good. For those that are weary of oxtail meat, you wouldn't tell much of a difference from standard beef. The plate was enough for a few to share. As for the main course, I had a regular hamburger, added avocado and fried egg. It was a tasty treat and I was not disappointed. 

The atmosphere seemed to cater more towards a younger crowd. They play pop music, have decent staff and not much to complain about. The prices are mid level but food quality is in line with prices. Would definitely try again"}
{"text":"These burgers are so good they should be illegal... No, I'm serious. 

And if you ever tried anything at In-N-Out et al and actually liked it, I advise you to please get your taste buds aligned before making a stop at Bachi."}
{"text":"The raw food wasn't the worst part (the \"in your face\" manager was)

There was water on our table when we were seated (a little creepy, since we couldn't see that it hadn't been previously been given to someone else.  Also, it was unfiltered and had a bad taste.)

We had heard about Bachi Burger on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and checked out the reviews before going.  The menu was very creative, and my husband and I looked forward to our Truffle Parmesan Fries (which we ordered as an appetizer), Ronin Burger and Kiki's Burger.

The fries took a while to come out, and while they weren't what we expected, they were delicious.  We were disappointed that we weren't given plates and that they all didn't have truffle flavor, but they were very good overall and the dipping sauce was great.

The burgers arrived while we were eating our appetizer.

We both ordered our burgers \"rare,\" and our burgers both came \"black and blue.\"  The toppings on the burgers were tasty (except the egg on my Ronin burger was overdone)  My husband managed to eat half of his burger but really didn't enjoy it.

Our server never once checked in on us, so my husband wasn't able to send his burger back to be cooked.  When the server finally came back and finally asked us how everything was, my husband told him that his burger was undercooked and said how disappointed he was that the server never checked in with us.  The server offered to have another burger made or to \"do something,\" but my husband didn't want anything other than the check and asked that the server just clear the table.  

A few minutes later, the \"in your face\" manager came to the table, shoved the plate under my husband's nose and belligerently told him that the burger was rare.  The manager was really nasty and defensive.  We were shocked by this -- especially since we didn't ask the server to send over the manager.

The manager came out ready for a fight and refused to try to understand that all my husband wanted was recognition that the server should be trained to check in on tables shortly after food is served so that issues can be dealt with on a timely basis.

After the manager left, one of the owners overheard that something was wrong and came over to the table.  My husband asked for an apology from the manager.  The manager was brought out and continued to be snarky and defensive. (His apology to my husband was akin to that of a eighth grader whose mother makes him apologize for something that he didn't  think was wrong.)

The table of five next to us also had undercooked burgers and didn't eat most of their food either.  My husband pointed that out to both the owner and the manager while they were at our table.  As you would expect, the manager was defensive, and the owner seemed to listen.  That said, we won't be going back -- not because the burgers were undercooked but because of the shoddy service and the bad attitude of management.

As I sat there and watched this unfold, all I kept thinking is that this place is probably a few months away from being a candidate for \"Restaurant Impossible.\"  Robert Irvine would NEVER allow staff to berate a customer because the customer complained about being served raw food.

I understand that restaurants can have an off night but the manager's attitude is simply unforgivable."}
{"text":"They make some of their burgers with wagyu beef and its soooooooo delicious! we also got an order of the oxtail fries which were also worth the hype."}
{"text":"The burgers were pretty good. Although when I order medium, I expect not so much of a char on the outside of the patty. I ordered the Kiki Burger with a Wagyu patty, and I feel the style bun doesn't match with that burgers ingredients. The garlic and salt fries were so over washed with the taste of ginger that it numbed my tongue and overplayed tasting anything else. Service was bad considering I was paying 16 for a burger, the busser was rude and the server did not seem interested in being here. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I expect a burger place to be efficient and customer friendly. They are not. First the parking area is cluttered and small. Second and most importantly....we were made to wait 45 minutes even if we were the only people in line. We are just buying burgers!!! Not prime rib steaks. No wonder while were approaching the entrance a couple in front of us turned around and left. For us about a minute into the wait, we decided to go to another place."}
{"text":"INSANE!! Great burger joint....err.... Culinary adventure! Bachi Burger is not your ordinary burger joint, it is definitely kicked up - not just a notch - but a whole hell-of-a-lot! They have all kinds of combinations to choose from. The burgers at Bachi are influenced by familiar and not so familiar, Asian and Hawaiian flavors. Burger like: \"Mr. Hos Burger\" (Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sautéed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, on a Taro Bun), \"Shogun Burger\" (Wagyu Beef, UNAGI!!! Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach) I mean c'mon!!

AND - I had a rare \"Spicy Miso Burger\" (Angus Beef, Onions, Shishito Pepper, Mayo, Lettuce, Roasted Garlic, Swiss Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette) - and to say it was delicious is an understatement! To accompany my burger I order the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries - equally as awesome as the burger! The only problem is that its way too much for one person to eat!

I could really write on forever but I will spare you. The choices here are endless. creative burgers, Boba drinks, milkshakes, sodas (made in house), milk teas, coffees, micro-brews, and even SAKE.

Enough reading now go try it!"}
{"text":"I was a little bit Leary about taking my husband here sine he is extremely picky about his burger and will not eat it if it's not very well done. They catered to his order and he actually gave it a 10.  Kudos to this place. Excellent food."}
{"text":"This Bachi Burger Restaurant is very good!  I love how they give extra truffle sauce for the fries, and the burger is on point.  Definitely worth going  back for more."}
{"text":"I just ate a burger here that had wagyu beef (perfect medium rare), foie gras, grilled pears and unagi on it, sided by a delicious Yamamomo peach. I would order all of those things on their own - so it have them all show up in one burger? Definitely a strong contender for the best burger I've had in my life.

Also they have a milkshake containing Kahlua, amaretto, cherry vodka and actual cherries. 

Thank god this restaurant is far away from home - it'd be dangerous to have closer than a flight plus 20 min car ride away."}
{"text":"What can I say! Bachi Burger is the best.....

When I have out of town friends,  I always bring them to Bachi Burger for the Ox tail fried and the burgers. One time I had to pick up friends from the airport. The first thing the say to me I want to eat at the burgers place. No hello etc., That Burger place. Lol!

Food and service is the best. Also the donuts is amazing. No matter how full we are, there is always room for donuts. Just need to share."}

Not bad.
Burgers are so-so & a bit gimmicky, but the rest of menu deserves recognition.

***Short Review

Came here for lunch on a weekend on Jul '11.

Cooking here has an obvious Asian influence.
I feel knowing what to order may be key here, as some ideas work better than others.

Wagyu smokey-mountain burger (around $18) was so-so.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=H5rikXxhih1j-arkh9vnqA
The patty was a bit too lean and lacked flavor.
The condiments were overpoweringly sweet and overwhelmed the beef patty.
I don't think this was a very well thought out burger.

Oxtail chili-cheese fries here were orgasmic.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=CuZzpQ4AZSIOQ-mQYsPf-w
It's a large mound of thin fries topped with heaps of minced delicious  ox-tail, and topped with a fried egg.
Portions are enough for 2-4 ppl to make a meal out of.
Come here for this if nothing else.

Ambiance is so-so.
The place is comfortable enough, but the interior is very generic suburban.
Wait times are a tad lengthy, it took me around 30 mins to get my burger. 

Service is about average.
Value is very reasonable, although some items present a better value than others.

Far from my favorite burger, but overall not a bad place at all.
Definitely worth the drive from the strip if you want to try something a little different.  Avoid if more typical Asian inspired fusion cooking isn't your thing.  

***Detailed Review

Wagyu smokey-mountain burger (approx $18)
(Dish Rating, 30%)

Beef cuts used were chuck and rib-eye.  Cows were fed, if i recall correctly, a combination of hay, potatoes, corn, & wheat.  I was hoping this would provide a more robust and distinct flavor profile, but it turned out quite bland.  I ordered my burger rare, and it did come out that way.  However, the meat was fairly lean and didn't have too many juices.  Typically when I cut into a 'rare' burger, the meat is red.  Here its strangely more brown.  It might as well be 'mystery meat'.  Perhaps medium rare or medium might yield more satisfying results.  

I've noticed a lack of flavor and fat content (but added tenderness in texture) with any burgers from Snake Rivers Wagyu, and this has been the case in my experience for other restaurant that offer the same beef.  It is important to note that some of the burger characteristics might come from the meat supplier, rather than the chef's preparation.  Skip the next paragraph if you're not interested in the details.

I've noticed that some of the patties are made by Snake Rivers are pre-prepared & frozen on site, as opposed to being made from scratch by the restaurant itself.  I'm not certain that this is the case, but it may be a possibility.  It's also important to note that I'm not implying the beef from Snake Rivers isn't to my liking, as I don't recall trying their steaks yet and therefore can't say.  I have provided a few links on Snake Rivers.

You may get a much better burger experience here if you keep it simple with the condiments offered.  Because the flavor of the patty isn't particularly robust, I feel more subtly flavored condiments would work best. 

The condiments used on my smokie mountain burger sounded interesting on paper, but turned out to be a mess.  Condiments used (heirloom tomatoes, truffle butter, what resembled caramelized onions, and some other ingredients I didn't find memorable) weren't balanced and gave the burger an overwhelmingly undistinguished mush of sweet flavors and mismatched textures.  Flavor of the otherwise bland patty was overwhelmed entirely.

The bun is more brioche-like.  It's nice and holds the burger well, but I felt was a tad hard in texture.  There was also more bread than I would have liked, so I opted to eat it open faced instead.

Overall this wasn't the worst burger I've had, but certainly not my favorite by quite a bit.

'Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries' were to die for.  This is where I felt Bach did a great job, using  their succulent minced oxtail, covered with jalapeno peppers, beans, (cheddar?) cheese, fried egg, mixed over a mound of fries.  Flavors here are very robust and well paired together.  The oxtail offers the most prominent flavor, but it's complemented well by the beans, peppers, and fries.  The flavors felt very Vietnamese to me.  

Fries used are similar to a McDonald's cut.  They are quite crispy and light.  Seasoning used is minimal and they're good by themselves, 

The absurdly large portion size was another wonderful bonus.  I felt it resembled more like a super decadent poutine dish.  Highly recommended.  82%

Looking back, I feel Bachi is capable of delivering some very solid ideas and cooking, but it isn't always consistent.  I doubt I could ever enjoy their burgers if no changes are made, but that's not to say they don't offer some other great choices.

Not bad"}
{"text":"Bachi takes burgers to a whole new level! Oxtail chili cheese fries are tasty! Although Johnny prefers the truffle parm fries -which are also amazing!  The shogun burger is my go to burger, but today I decided to try the miyagi-San burger and it's was yummy! The chili mayo paired with the grass fed wagyu beef with furikaki and onion rings were a tasty treat.  Definitely try this burger :) 

Honestly for me, nothing beats the shogun burger. Foie gras and wagyu pair together so wonderfully! The presentation alone is executed exceptionally.  The first bite is heavenly. Juicy. Flavorful. Surprising. Yes I am still talking about the shogun! If you got the extra cash to fork up $26 for a burger do so! It sounds like a lot for meat slapped between 2 buns, but it's well worth it! 

Overall a nice modern style restaurant with attentive staff! Clean. Cohesive. Prompt. Great service and always smiling faces!!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I didn't write a review of this place! My husband and I brought our son here with us on our Spring Break trip this year. I had read that they had a foie gras burger and since we are Californians and denied the joy of foie anymore, we had to come. 
Our picky eater son had the fries which he loved. My husband and I started with the chili fries with the oxtail. OMG. Like OMG. We both had the Shogun Burger. It was like angels sang and wept. THE BEST! The manager came by later and we told her how much we loved the burger. She said a lot of Californians come in and are enraptured by it. 
It's a hipster kinda place with Japanese influence but don't let that scare you off."}
{"text":"Came here last week for dinner.  Overall the experience was just \"ok\".  We arrived and had to wait about 5-10mins, which was no big deal since there were a few people in front of us and the restaurant looked busy.  When it was our turn to be seated we went around the partition and half the tables were empty, so I'm not sure what the wait was for. Our waiter was prompt and our drink/food order taken in no time.  ( Quick Side note: We were seated toward the back and across from us a table filled with folded dish towels and aprons were sitting out...not sure why it was on a table for customers to see.  I will give them credit and the items were moved half way through our meal.) The food however took a while to come out.  I know this isn't a fast-food place but it took about 25-30 mins  for our 2 burgers and fries to hit the table. (No we didn't do appetizers).  The food was good, but I don't really see what the hype is all about.  Will we eat here again? Maybe, but this won't be on my top 5."}
{"text":"I like Bachi Burger - and was a pretty big fan at one time. But I'm just not as impressed these days.

Most recently, I tried the \"No Meat Here\" vegetarian burger. It was a good attempt to make an interesting sandwich. Sadly, the burger itself was just not that good. Too dense and bean-y for my taste. All of the other additions to the burger - no matter how creative - won't save it if the main 'burger' is not great.

My date had the steamed pork buns, which he didn't finish. \"Just not that interesting\" was his take.

We shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries - and these were actually disappointing. Almost no Parmesan that we could see or taste. The Truffle Porcini Cream had a generally mushroomy taste, but only the slightest whiff of truffle - and there was only a drizzle of the sauce on the whole order of fries. Basically, it was just 'fries' with a garnish of sauce. I'd like to see a good deal more cheese, and wouldn't mind the sauce being served on the side - if messy finger food is a problem. But please use more truffle if you are going to advertise it as such. I will go out of my way for good truffle fries.

I have had excellent food here. 
Just not recently."}
{"text":"Hostess played games with seating and then lied about it when confronted( her name was laayken)Manager resolved it immediately. Wait staff was initially very polite( yes I m writing the review realtime).   When the silverware came no fork.   Only knife ....  Corrected fast.  GREAT service.  Had the Bhan Mi burger and Black and Green. Absolutely second to none, flawless idea and execution.  Just amazing food.   Only downer is the hostess is the face of your company and it starts the experience of bad when it is wrong. Love this food?"}
{"text":"The salt and pepper garlic fries are very good. They do offer unique burgers. Tried the Ronin Burger and was good now trying the Miyagi burger for a change. But all the items on the menu do have a promising look so I'm excited to keep coming back here."}
{"text":"After hearing about Bachi Burger for oh-so-long, we decided to make a stop over on our way back home. Luckily, there wasn't a long line and a group of 8 of us were able to sit fairly quickly. We were placed right in front of the TV so we were also able to watch the last game of the World Cup. Score! Service was really good. Food... amazeballs. They have different kinds of burgers, but honorable mention goes to: Kiki Burger and MIyagi-san. The oxtail fries and the truffle fries were also really good. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's an upscale burger joint with \"fusion\" alternatives.

Burger, Fries and a \"coke\" for $20

*Bachi Burger -   It's a fine line between caramelized and charred. My burger came charred. I ordered med-well and was advise it would be pink in the middle. I said,\"perfect\"....well, that wasn't the case when it showed up.
The Bun and Veggies were up to par. I ordered an egg with it and it was cooked perfectly. It was the patty that ruined the meal- the flakes of charred matter killed the burger. I couldn't even taste the red onion

*Just Fries -  Over priced ($3.50) for plain skinny fries. 

*Root Beer -  Soda machine needs calibration. $2.50 for a flat soda. I asked for another and they cranked up the carbonation mix and it tasted too carbonated.

The only reason why the place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the atmosphere and its employees.The manager was very apologetic and asked what she could do to make it up.

Sorry Bachi, I can get a decent burger, fries and \"coke\" for $10 at fuddruckers or fatburger. And for a little over $5 I can get an In-n-out burger.

For $20 - go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant inside Paris Hotel and Casino and order a Lamb Burger (5 stars). There's a dress code; so no flip-flops and shorts"}
{"text":"Finally. That word describes how I felt upon arriving to bachi. My good friend Dmagic had raved about this place for awhile and made me excited to give it a whirl.

It took some effort to finally get out there, but we finally made it and oh am I glad we did. 

A few friends of mine wanted to make sure we tried a few items, so they ordered the truffle fries as well as the Peking duck buns. Man these buns were solid. I have had similar buns at other locations and these are just as good as other competitors and a must try. 

With so many burger options it was sort of overwhelming because all of them sounded so good! But I ended up settling on the Miyagi-son burger. With the onion rings, marinade, and egg with furrikakke, I was blown away. Burger was packed with flavors from all angles. 

Oddly enough my favorite part of this burger that I think sets it apart though is the bun. The bun is so soft, but yet has a crispness to it just right on the outer layer. One of the best buns I have had. 

One of the cool things about this place too was the fact that even though they are a craft burgers paradise, they were not snobs as other places I have been to are. My brother does not consume bread and wanted a protein style burger and they totally accommodated him with out hesitation. And he loved his burger. 

If you are ever in the Vegas area, this is a must stop. I will be back multiple times! I would say this burger is definitely in my top 5 that I have tried, possibly top 3. Awesome."}
{"text":"burgerrrr,, OMG. their burgers are perfect. Taste amazing, nice seasoned, and  the oxtail chili cheese fries are killin it. will go again for sure."}
{"text":"We eat here alot. Food is always good, would love to give four stars, however, service is always hit or miss. More often than not, service leaves much to be desired, and occasionally even bad, occasionally it is also good, but it is never great.

If we didn't have some favorites on the menu we probably would not come back, but the food is usually pretty consistently yummy.

A word to management, you guys need a diaper changer in the bathroom, its such a pain when I need to change a diaper and literally have no place to go."}
{"text":"Very very interesting flavors. Innovative and unique. I enjoyed this spot quite a bit.   Definitely going to be a go-to spot on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was going to ding them a star cuz I felt like we waited a while but I enjoyed the food so much that I don't care anymore! We got the oxtail fries and the miyagi burger. Both excellent choices with unique flavors! Want to go back to try the other burgers! They have one with foie gras & unagi!"}
{"text":"09/06/17 - Just moved to Vegas recently and the talk around town is that burgers are pretty big out here. I decided to call up my cousin and we headed out to bachi burger and all I can say is that I was more than satisfied with this joint. Our waiter, Hector, was a pretty chill dude he was attentive to our needs. We got to ordering and we decided to stsrt off with an appetizer, Oxtail chili cheese fries, and they were DELICIOUS!! They had great flavor and everything it had complemented each other nicely. For our main courses we got the Kikis burger and Miyagi san burger with a side of Truffle parmesian fries and all of that did not disappoint. Went in with an empty stomach came out feeling 50 pounds heavier, in a good way, great first experience here and definetely not the last. I wouls totally recomend going to try this place if you haven't before."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Had half of the Bahn Mi Burger and half of the Spicy Miso Burger!!  (husband and I split our burgers) So yummy! I didn't get a picture of the Bahn Mi before I scarfed it down... But I did get a picture of the tasty Salted Caramel & Toasted Marshmallow Milk Shake! Sooo good! I want more (except I'm way too full!)"}

{"text":"I have read many reviews and have seen the episode of Triple D of Bachi Burger.

Knowing that I would be in LV I made it a point to stop and try out this place that is reviewed so highly! 

I ordered :
* Miyagi-San Burger which is a Grass Fed Wagyu Beef Burger. Topped off with a Fried Egg,Bacon,Crispy Onion Rings,Chili Mayo and Furikake..OMG! Holy Cow! This burger cooked perfectly medium as ordered, I must say  that this is the best burger I have ever eaten to date. The fried egg and ingredients work harmoniously to make it taste (In Hawaiian terms \"SO Fricken ONO!!) . One more thing I judge my burger on is the drip test and yes it passed!. I could not put the burger back down on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g#egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g

*Caesar Salad: Good size portion, Baby Romaine,Slices of Avacado,Tomato and Chicken Breast was good and refreshing. The dressing not overpowering.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g#pq1AGozTZIOeOKMIIIcWrQ

*Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries: These fries spicy good! It came with slices of green pepper in it and the Garlic Chili Aioli sauce was really really good. (Note to self: ORDER YOUR OWN FRIES AND DON'T SHARE)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=egDohkCNmDuiszwmvtmd1g#4-OT6yvqRkjOWerrRzxTMQ

{"text":"Oh my gosh! - yummy! Bahn-Mi Burger is a must try. All of the food was fresh, full of flavor, and delicious. I am so bummed there is not a Bachi Burger near me!!! If there is one near you, you do not want to miss out. It is a little pricey for a burger, but it is def. worth trying."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, all fresh, well cared for food. The Bon Mi burger was awesome, the bread oh so soft and fluffy. The caesar salad- believe it or not, was fantastic! The service is great! Really a star in the Restaurant off the strip scene of las vegas!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I would give more stars if the service wasn't lacking so much. We first arrived, the front area was packed. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. There was nowhere to stand or sit inside, so waited outside. The man told us he would come and get us when our table was ready. No one came for us so my husband went in to check to see how much longer the wait was and they just happened to be calling his name (they said they were going to come and get us, so I don't know why they were calling his name). The front area definitely needs to be managed better and set up differently. It seems way too small.

The server was nice but she seemed like she was overly busy. She wasn't very attentive at all. Her mind seemed to be elsewhere. We ordered our drinks and it took her a while to get them back to us. My husband was annoyed because his beer wasn't cold and the glasses weren't frosted (when she told us they were). The glasses were like shot glasses. I've never seen a beer glass so small. Is that the new thing? Maybe I'm out of the loop, lol. 

The food was good but nothing I was amazed by. We ordered a side of fries for our son and we loved the pineapple ketchup it came with. That was yummy. We also started off with the oxtail chili fries. My husband really enjoyed them, me not so much. They were too spicy for me because of the jalapeños and I was also wondering where the oxtail meat was? There was also barely any beans. The fries were a bit overcooked too for my liking. Some of them were way too crunchy. Also, when the fries first arrived at our table, the egg was already broken. That's no fun! 

For our entrees, we split the Peking Duck Steamed buns and the Ronin burger. The duck buns were very good with the hoisin sauce. The buns were steamed perfectly and the fried egg mimicked cheese. They were definitely delicious. I'd like to try the pork belly buns. The biggest disappointment of the night was the Ronin burger. We would have been extremely satisfied if they cooked it medium like we requested. The burger came out well done. They cooked the angus beef way too much. We don't like sending food back so we just ate it as is. However, we did let the waitress know that they overcooked it. The flavors of the burger were delicious though. If they cooked it medium then it would have been great. The cole slaw, fried egg, onions, and aioli had a great taste. The bun was also grilled a bit too much. 

The decor was cool but there was a big eyesore out on the front deck of the restaurant. There is a pile of old cooking equipment outside which makes it look really unprofessional. At the end of our meal, we felt like we were being rushed out by the waitress. My husband wasn't even finished his beer and the waitress came over asking if we needed the credit card settled. We hadn't even gave her a credit card so I don't know why she thought that. Her mind was definitely lost. Overall, the place is good but has potential to be better than it is if they fix a few things."}
{"text":"Meh, not worth the hype. 
It made me sick last time but I gave it another try and they didn't win me over."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. At first we weren't sure which door to open as there was no sign on it.  No worries though because the host (nice, young man) opened their door and welcomed us in. We heard so much about this place and we are so glad we tried the food here. I had the \"kiki's burger\" which was a burger with caramelized bacon, guyere cheese and enoki and eryngii mushrooms (I've never heard of eryngii mushrooms but they were delicious).  Even before the burgers came out, the sweet potatoe fries and the truffle, Parmesan fries with sun dried tomato aioli and porcini cream sauce were awesome!  You HAVE to try that. My parents joined us and are in their 80's and will usually not eat lunch while in Vegas but my dad cleaned his plate!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I've been disenchanted with burger joints lately but one hit it out of the park. It had great prices for the amount of food you get. The flavors were amazing. 

The waitress that served us was awesome. Sometimes she was too fast and would just drop something off even though we were trying to get her attention. 

It's a great place to go"}
{"text":"This is \"Our Place\" for casual dining. It's usually always packed 'cause its THAT GOOD, even on a Tuesday night. Everything about it is awesome; food, service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger I have ever had!!  I had the Kalbi Burger and truffle fries and the fries were bomb too!!!  Only eaten here a couple of times since I dont live in Vegas but will def eat at again!!  The oxtail chili cheese fries were to die for as well."}
{"text":"So my review may not be appropriate because I sinfully ordered a salad instead of a burger.  The Full Salad to be exact.  I needed a protein so I went with the waiters recommendation of adding cod.  While the salad was good individually, the fish was overpowered by a sweet teriyaki marinade.  In turn, overpowering the entire salad.  I also ordered a passion fruit boba tea being a fan of boba teas.  I wasn't expecting it to be milk-based so unfortunately this missed the spot too.

Our table did have some fries that we shared and those were good.  The service and atmosphere are good too.  Take this review for what it is... I look forward to coming back again in future for another try.  However, ordering a burger next time.  (I'll update my review again then)"}
{"text":"Ordered: bison burger medium to share. Received: bison burger scorched beyond recognition. No extra plate.
Ordered: oxtail chili cheese fries
Received: overly salty soggy mass atop fries, which didn't allow me to appreciate the deliciousness that is oxtail. 
I had heard this place is good, but I left thirsty and feeling rather disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this Bachi Burger several times since it has opened and I love it. The Asian inspired burgers, fries and ramen are fantastic. We bring guests here a lot or come by for lunch/ dinner.

My favorite is the Shogun burger with seared froie gras. If a plain burger is what you want, you can customize it to just that. One out of town guest, was not familiar with the menu options and opted for a plain burger with lettuce, onions, ketchup and mustard. The staff was more than ok to do it and our guest loved his burger.

The environment is clean and sleek. It is a popular place, so you may need to wait for a table but it's worth the wait. The staff are super friendly and upbeat. Awesome package all the way around."}
{"text":"Bad experience from start to finish. First off, they made me pleasantly wait half hour to seat us in a half empty restaurant with no line. It helped me ponder on the meaning of life. So time wasn't completely wasted. We were sat down and drink orders were taken. After 10 wonderful minutes the waitress informs me with great news that they have ran out of my beer (bluemoon) then she suggested the horchata bluemoon (wtf), needless to say I just ordered an Arrogant Bastard. Later on that night we were served our burgers which actually weren't that bad until I noticed my burger was slightly undercooked. After delightful banter with my friends and great stories from the good ol days we parted ways. As soon as I got home I knew there was a problem. My intestines felt like there were twisted in ways only a toddler scribble on a chalk board could begin to describe. All I could think about was that evil burger and the pain it has caused me. Turns out my friend also got sick. I think a visit from the health department would be a nice treat for them. So if you really don't like somebody just recommend they eat there. You will thank me later. Good night."}
{"text":"Ok so the burgers here are amazing. And different from the average burger you'd get somewhere else. My faves are the black and blue and the miyagi-San. The buns are so light and fluffy and the patties are nice and thick. Service is hit or miss depending on the server- however I have to say the last time we went we had a really great staff looking out for us. The salt and pepper fries are amazing too. Overall I would recommend this place for a delicious and unique burger."}
{"text":"Great service from the moment we walked into the door! The staff was very friendly and the quality of the food was extremely high considering the pricing on their menu. In would highly recommend this place for breakfast and brunch. Only tried breakfast menu bit it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever including very rude hostess. We were told we could sit at the bar & we were looking at a 25-30 minute wait. Then at the bar several people were eating but we were told we couldn't because there was 2 of us!!! Only parties of 1. Not even an appetizer for the long wait which ended up being an hour wait. Then upon finally being seated we were told there's an hour backup on food. After placing order & waiting on empty glasses of water, the server let us know he couldn't run my card because machines were down. We had to sit there an extra 25 minutes after eating for them to finally run my card. It's clear they don't care about their customers. I used to go here all the time but after the last few times of very poor & unfriendly service, I'll be going to Skinnyfats or Burger Bar at Mandalay for a much better burger & service."}
{"text":"I came here during the day and ordered the oxtail fries nd miyagi fries. The oxtail fries was so much that I did not get a chance to finish it. Its good but it did not gave me a wow factor. The miyagi burger however was one of the most unique tasing burger I have tasted. Throughly a unique creation! Love the patty so much!!!

Wish i could return here again the next time i visit vegas. Dying to try their ramen!"}
{"text":"My family and I are from Cali and saw this place on Triple D.  We had, a 45 minute wait to be seated but it was worth the wait!  
We started our meal with the oxtail chili fries which are a must try.  The flavors explode in your mouth and you just can't have enough, the fries are cut thin and stay crisp even under the chili, the fried egg on top adds a nice creaminess in contrast with the spice of the jalapeno slices, just perfect!
The pork belly steamed buns are delicious, thick slice of marinated pork belly, greens, radish, hard boiled egg, in a soft semi-sweet light bun,and a hoisin type dipping sauce.  We also had the Miyagi San's burger, the perfect combination of meat, crunch, creamy, savory, salty, and garlic.  Kiki's burger was another great one, the different textures achieved with the addition of mushrooms, and the creamy spicy aioli is just perfect.
It is a first come first served restaurant so be prepared to wait but the old adage \"Good things come to those who wait\" really applies here.  Service was a bit slow but we came during their busy dinner time.  Their manager Alan Torres was just nice and came by to check on customers at their tables to ensure everything was going well with their meal.  If you are in Vegas you must try Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhmaaazzziiing!! Ordered the oxtail chilly cheese fries.  mind blown. Y'all must try!"}
{"text":"It has been exactly 40 weeks since I had the Miyagi-San burger with oxtail chili cheese fries (my instagram told me so) and I have probably consumed 60 burgers since then and 6000 burgers prior to that and let me just say this... NOT ONE of those burgers can even be considered in the same class as Bachi Burger.... I was in Vegas on a business trip and one of my coworkers was ranting and raving about the good things he heard about this place so we decided to go. When we first pulled up we were all busting his balls because it's behind a subway and doesn't look like anything special. Boy was I wrong.... I wish I was kidding when I say that the Bachi burger comes up EVERY TIME we talk! This is hands down the best burger I have ever had in my entire life, no questions asked. I would have walked there from my hotel backwards and barefoot just to eat Bachi Burger again, it's that good...! 
6 stars, 3 thumbs standing ovation for this place, seriously!!! Bring one of these to Pittsburgh and I will manage it, you can pay me in Miyagi-Sans!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a nice composition of asian influence with all american hamburgers.  Pretty much everything on the menu looks amazing, but I didn't have a large enough stomach to try everything.  Just pick out one from the special burgers if you are adventurous and want to try something different.  If you are more traditional, you can get the standard burgers but go for the wagyu beef or kobe.  Be sure to also grab an order of the truffle fries.

One of the most impressive parts of my visit was the Black Milk Tea.  Maybe it was because I was hungover, but I must say it was some of the best milk tea I've ever had.

Service was excellent and it wasn't too crowded on a saturday afternoon for lunch.

Pretty much come here and try new stuff if you can.  Its a bit off the strip but its worth it.  Bachi Burger and Burger Bar in Mandalay will now have to compete to get my visit whenever I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"It has been a couple of months ago so excuse the late review but I have eaten at this location four or five times even though I'm from California. So now that the disclaimer is out of the way, onto the review. 

Bachi burger are for those who like their taste buds to rome wild.  Bachi is connected via a door way to their sister restaurant Shoku Ramen. Which closes earlier even though they share the same space. 

I started with Salt and Pepper Garlic fries. It's served with Jalapeños and a garlic chili aioli sauce.  This is great way to start off a meal. It's an explosion of tastes and it lights up your tastes buds begging for more. 

Then the Miyagi-San burger arrives and I instinctively bow my head in a gesture of respect to this masterful burger.  After practicing my wax on wax off techniques (if you understood that reference you just dated yourself) I begin to indulge myself by bitting into the burger.  I enjoy a fried egg in my burgers and if you have never had an egg in your burger, Bachi is definitely the place to venture out of the norm.

Your mouth is challenged by the opposing textures. The hamburger bun is soft as a cloud and paired with the crispiness of the onion straws, all you can do is close your eyes and enjoy the sensory overload. At that point the flavors of the caramelized bacon and sauces kick in, and when you least expect it you are in a blissful comatose. 

I recently tried the chili fries and it's an out of body experience. Don't be afraid of the ox tail and you will pleasantly surprise your taste buds. Bachi is not where you come to be conservative or play it safe. Be adventurous and you will walk away a happy camper. 

If you want an amazing burger and avoid the strip, this is the place the come.  Since I work so often in Vegas, this is definitely one of my safe havens."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else said get the of tail fries! Mmmm. I got the ronin burger that was quite good as well. At the table we had sweet potato fries that came with a really good spicy ranch sauce and this fries went real quick."}
{"text":"I never would have come here on my own, so I'm glad I was brought along. I was told that there was amazing boba here, but when we arrived, they didn't serve any. Water was good, however. 

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and shared two burgers - the spicy miso burger and the ronin burger. Both burgers were great, but there was something about the miso burger that stood out a little more. The fries were amazing, and I would have finished them had I not been wearing a crop top and out with a cute boy I was crushing on. Hahaha."}
{"text":"Today I am giving 5 stars. Why, you are asking... 
Today was the 5th time within the last six months that I ate there, and it is consistently excellent. Never ever have I been disappointed. The oxtail chili fries are always a must! Try them, the mix of the different flavors! Delicious! Even my husband, who usually doesn't like 'exotic' food, was thrilled. When it comes to the burgers. I always crave the Miso Burger! It's the best of the best! 
And now, go enjoy! 
Very friendly and professional staff too!"}
{"text":"Saw this place featured on the Food Network and had to try it! 

BAHN MI BURGER!!! Who knew that a pork-shrimp burger patty would be everything I ever wanted in life?? 

Pair that with the truffle fries (drizzled with their insane mushroom gravy) and you've got it made. So glad they opened up locations in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"the Kiki burger is fantastic. 

shitake mushrooms, greens, nice and squishy bun.. sweetness. i didnt even need ketchup! and i put ketchup on almost everything!!!

the salt and pepper fries tastes like crab. you know.. the asian crab thats boiled and is seasoned with salt and pepper? exactly that. it was the weirdest thing ever. but delicious. 

this is a gem thats off the strip and is definitely worth the drive.  its not even that far.. but i would highly recommend coming here on your way home from vegas.  

I wasn't even hungry.. but after the first bite, i couldn't stop.. and then the fries!? jeez... so much for trying to get fit and lose weight!!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited this place from California, at around 11:30am on Easter Sunday. We heard many good things about this place, so we had to try it during our mini-vacation to Las Vegas. 
---
Parking: Plenty: spacious parking lot.

Service: We were seated right away because we had called in a couple of minutes before (reservations only for parties of 8 or more.) Our server, Asian girl w/ sock bun hair, was just alright. I've definitely had better service elsewhere. I felt as if she was annoyed the whole time because it was mine and my family's first time and we were indecisive. Throughout our whole meal though, she did check up on us and asked us how we were doing, but I didn't like that it felt as if it was such a hassle to ask her for sauces, which they do charge for, by the way. One of the reasons why I dropped this place down to two stars was because of the action of our server: not to us, but to her fellow employee. During our meal, the restaurant did get a little busy & our server was becoming extremely frustrated. She was frustrated at her coworker & walked away & out loud said, \"Fuck you, then.\" I thought I was the only one who heard it, until my mom asked me if what she heard was right & my brothers admitted to hearing it as well. She was also making comments about her worker being a \"dumbass.\" That was such a turn off. Saying those things is already a bad thing, but to say those things in front of your customers is horrible and totally unprofessional. 

Food: 
What we ordered: 
Truffle Fries: Not too good. Only the top of (some) fries had truffle sauce on them, therefore, only some of the fries had flavor.

Salt & Pepper Fries: A little spicy! Comes with jalapeño slices, served with pineapple ketchup: Best thing on the menu, lol.

Oxtail Fries: Disgusting! I was really excited to try this item since majority of the Yelpers raved about this, but it was horrible. 

Pork Buns: My brother didn't like it. The pork was hard and mostly fat.

Miyagi San burger- Both of my brothers enjoyed this item. They substituted the patty w/ Wagyu beef. However, my stepdad, a burger connoisseur, didn't like it at all.

Kimchi Burger- I'm not too sure what this one was called, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it.

I didn't like the choices of burgers they had offered, so I ordered a plain Wagyu beef burger w/ lettuce, onion rings & grilled mushrooms. Our server charged me for extra spicy garlic aioli on the side, which makes me question, shouldn't the sauce be included IN the burger? I'm not going to lie, I had high hopes for this item, for I had heard many good things about grass-fed Wagyu beef, but it was just okay. I do have to admit that it's a better quality burger, but it's not worth the trip and time. I had asked for a side of mayo & a side of mushroom sauce ($1) which was pretty flavorful, since my burger was a bit bland. 

Tip: Be careful and check your receipt before you pay. Our server doubled up on the sauces. When I confronted a nicely dressed man, possibly the manager, he walked up to our server, asked how many we had ordered & told her that she overcharged us, she rolled her eyes and said \"whatever, just change it.\" We were seated in the long table, right next to the kitchen. That's how I heard her. 

I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Its soooo good! Had the kiki's burger, it was delicious, unlike anything I've ever had. The salt and pepper garlic fries were so flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars and only because the food was good. The waitress, Crystal, on the other hand was terribly aloof and snobbish and clearly did not want to be there. She was slow and we had to constantly get up to flag her or someone down. Please keep in mind there were only 2-3 other tables and they had their own servers. I can understand when someone is having a bad day but this girl was ridiculous. If you get annoyed when even taking orders then maybe you need to get a new job."}
{"text":"Really great burgers with a pan-Asian flavor profile.  That's what most people come here for and won't be disappointed.  The Kiki and the Ronin are my favorites.  For me, the egg on the Ronin is unnecessary and I go without it.  One great feature of their burgers is the crust they develop on one side - really nicely browned and delicious beefiness. 

Lots of people get fries with their burger.  The fries themselves are well-cooked (previously frozen) spuds with some interesting flavorings and dipping sauces.  The only one to avoid is the \"salt and peppers garlic...\" which, to me, tasted like it had way too much lemongrass in it.  Stick with the standard fries or the truffle ones and you'll be happy. 

Don't forget the appetizers!  The pickles are unusual (good unusual) if you are wanting an adventure, the edamame is excellent, and the fried calamari are among the best you can find anywhere (and you can eat the fried lemons that come with it).

The ramen here is really good too.  Amazingly, perhaps more filling than their burgers.

Lastly, the service.  It is friendly and a bit on the leisurely side.  But, they tend to leave you alone to have a good time."}
{"text":"This restaurant, in an unassuming strip mall in an unassuming neighborhood of Las Vegas, served one of the best meals I've ever had in this city.  We vacation often in Hawaii, and one of the wonderful things about the islands is the way that they manage to take local, organic ingredients and elevate casual food like burgers and noodles in a way that makes them amazing.  Almost from the moment I walked in the door, I was transported back to Hawaii, and was not surprised to learn that the owners came from there.  This is the best of foodie casual food, and everything we had was delicious, creative, and well-prepared.  Flavor is everywhere.  Skip the high-priced, over-hyped Strip restaurants, and head straight over here.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Omg is amazing. The wait is well worth it. The oxtail fries so delicious. The burgers are big and greasy. This is a place to take your friends and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. I do not hunk that I've had anything bad here. 
The burgers are great, my favs are the spicy miso, and the kalbi. The pork belly and duck buns are great. People really like the oxtail chili fries, but they are not my favorite becaus the chili is too sweet and I can't really taste the oxtail a which I love.
Service is always decent, never have a complaint"}
{"text":"We took a taxi out to come visit this place and it was well worth it. 
We had three burgers

Oxtail chili fries 
Spicy miso
Miyagi San grass fed Waygu 
Kiki 

Of the 4, by far, oxtail fries was amazingly good. I love oxtail and this was a great take on it! 

As for the burgers, I really enjoyed the Kiki the best. The mushrooms and the sauce had a lot of flavor. 

The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well. 

Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor. 

The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full. 

I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this out of the way gem using the Yelp mobile app, and I feel really lucky. It's good to feel lucky in Vegas.

I can't give five stars for only one visit, but it was close to a five-star experience. Someone there knows what they're doing, especially with the burgers. These aren't your typical teriyaki cheeseburgers passing off as Asian fast food. 

First, the salt & pepper fries were first rate: thin, crispy, a little spicy (topped with some jalepenos). The fried chicken \"kara-age\" appetizer was also very good. They know how to fry food and season it to go with your beer. 

The pork belly steamed buns, sort of like sliders with bao-style buns and excellent hoisin dipping sauce, were very tasty. My 7-year-old son gobbled them up. 

I was skeptical about the Banh-mi Burger, but it blew me away. They go to great lengths to capture the essence of the classic Vietnamese sandwich, right down to the pate, herbs, and fantastic nam plah dipping sauce. Dip, bite, chew, smile. Repeat.

I also tried the Lonely Bird, a blended poultry burger (turkey/chicken) that somehow captures the flavors of \"tsukune\", the chicken meatballs doused in sweet sauce that you order at Japanese yakitori houses. Again, someone here knows their Asian flavors and makes sure these creations are not just burgers with different special sauces. 

I can't wait to return to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"My Mom's cousin had seen this restaurant on the Cooking Channel so many times she was thrilled to finally try it!  This review is based on the impression of all four of us.  

I uploaded a photo of some of the decor.  They have cool Asian themed backlit panels on the wall with large screen TVs.  Black tables with a line of black booths dividing the dining room in two.  The black painted ventilation shafts against the ceiling lined with halogen track lighting and hidden speakers give it a slightly industrial feel.  The rest of it feels like pre-club trendy.  I dug it but others in the party thought the alt rock was out of place and the spotlight effect due to the angle of the lighting was distracting.  

The waiters and servers were all very nice and knew their product.  We ordered the Kiki, Ronin, Banh Mi and Lonely Bird sandwiches... and the oxtail chili cheese fries.  The $11.50 price tag on this immense appetizer should have given away the size of it.  Rich piquant chili, sweet beans with a creamy cheese sauce and jalapenos on a mound of tasty fries perfectly cooked and crisp crowned by a sizzling sunny side up fried egg (see uploaded photo).  Loved these!  But then I had no room for anything else!  

My party each loved their burgers!  Two managed to finish theirs but the rest of us barely managed half.  I had mixed feelings about my sandwich.  The bread was awesome.  Reminded me of Hawaiian King sweet bread with a beautiful egg white finish.  I don't care for mayonnaise and the sauce they served on the side had a great flavor but I couldn't get past the texture due to aforementioned mayonnaise Fear.  The marinade on the turkey-chicken patty was wayyyyy too sweet for me.  I ended up boxing most of it for my sweet-loving family.  I'm a savory gal all the way! 

Good experience, great fries and overall good sandwiches depending on which side of the sweet-savory fence you sit."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little hang out. Food is above average and service was great. Will likely return"}
{"text":"A very tasty burger with excellent meat and a great bun.  Service was professional.  Went to the outlet by the Fort Apache theatre.  Service was quick and the restaurant was clean.  Fries were good but not great and were a la carts."}
{"text":"BUZZ
- Bahn Mi Burger
- Kiki Burger
- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries
- Ronin Burger (5/10)
- Shogun Burger (6/10)


I ALSO TRIED
- Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns (6/10)

Ok, I'll admit, I was a little tipsy before coming here (it's Vegas!) but that only affects decisions, and not taste buds. Alright?! Case in point, I ordered the Ronin burger instead of the Kiki burger. Should've been a no-brainer because Kiki had garlic and Ronin didn't. ARGH! oh well....

So, someone said that this was on Diners Drive Ins & Dives and I didn't believe them, because this is neither a dive, nor is it tiny as hell. It's like an average sized burger joint -- not quite Red Robin, but like a smaller Smashburger or Five Guys. And well, the prices...they're average with a gourmet burger place $9-$10, unless you get the Shogun. 

DUCK STEAMED BUNS
So, these were pretty decent. They're served on steamed buns, but folded into like a small taco (steamed bun is about the size of a drink coaster). Flavor was sort of a sweet, soy, teriyaki kind of flavor, but the seasoning was pretty good. 

RONIN BURGER
It's got Miso dressing, Katsu BBQ, and a fried egg, amongst some others. You know why I know I was drunk? I would never order a burger with Miso anything! I like miso, but not outside Japanese food, and especially not on a burger.

Luckily for me, the miso is hard to taste, and as for the fried egg, I don't understand what the novelty is. Among the very light and almost hard to find flavors the patty was not seasoned enough, giving to a very lackluster performance. The flavors were enough that you can taste that they're not absent, but it's not enough to really notice. It did have a small sweet and salty persuasion, but again, nothing worth mentioning.

SHOGUN BURGER
Whenever I try a new joint (especially if it's hyped), I assume that I'll never come back. I make sure to order as much on the menu as possible. This guy was eyeing me the whole time. $25 burger! So, feeling very generous, and drunk (it's Vegas!), I ordered one for the table. I split it into 8ths and gave a piece to everyone. Most thought it wasn't much better, but I thought it was definitely better than the Ronin.

It's not just beef, it's Wagyu Beef! And on top of that, there's Unagi and Foie Gras! It's also got peach and miso butter (can't escape miso tonight I guess (Vegas?)). The beef is noticeably more tender, and the flavors and seasoning are better. Now, I don't think I actually got any unagi in my bite, so I'm a little disappointed, yet the thought of fishy eel next to beef is a little worrisome. The sweetness this times comes from a little unagi sauce, which worked ok. There were certainly improvements in this burger over the Ronin, but not $15's worth!

BADCHI BURGER
Ok, my friends all picked on me because I was the only one that thought Bachi was less than orgasmic. I don't know, maybe I'm not all about the \"gourmet\" burger, but I feel like lately everyone's so worried about their toppings, they keep forgetting about the beef. Sure it's Angus, sure it's Waygyu, but that doesn't mean you don't have to season it or cook it properly! The patty isn't just filler protein, it's the main event! 

So, if you've never had it, fine, quell your curiosity. Otherwise, just go to In-n-Out.

Everyone's tastes are different, so here're some of my references (not in any order):
NOT A FAN: Fatburger, Five Guys, Tom & Eddies, Kuma's Corner
FAN: In-n-Out, Paradise Pup, Smashburger"}
{"text":"This place blew my freakin' mind. I'm from Los Angeles, where niche burger spots are literally on every street corner, but this place is absolutely incredible. The spicy miso burger is a revelation, and the pepper garlic fries are unlike anything I've ever tasted! I will definitely make a stop here on every Vegas trip from here on out."}
{"text":"I ordered a lychee boba, and was so excited.. It came out without a boba straw. I asked for a boba straw. They ran out. What the hell?

Aside from the 8 million year wait, the food was not too bad... but it didn't sit well (or stay in) my stomach and I got a severe case of indigestion and threw up a bit after lunch.  Maybe it was the pickled garlic from the pickles we ordered? Not sure but I feel very weary of coming back to this place. I ordered a banh mi burger. Could it have been undercooked pork? I'll never really know."}
{"text":"Ehhh this place is good but I prefer the Sahara and Fort Apache location. It's such a small place."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading so many good reviews of this place, I had to give it a try. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. 

I'll start with the good:
-They have a good variety of burgers and they are big enough to split if you are planning on having sides as well. (note: you have to order the sides separately) 
-I split the meatless burger which was pretty good. I could have done without the huge piece of fried tofu that was layered on top.
-The onion rings are SO good. Definitely order a side. They are sliced thin and have a nice crisp.

Here's the bad:
-The truffle fries were soggy...would not recommend 
-The kids menu is limited to 2 things: a $9 kids burger and an $8 \"grilled cheese\" which was basically a hamburger bun with melted cheese. My kid took one bite and put it down. The kid's burger was burned on the outside and pink on the inside but my other kid liked it anyway. 
-They don't have any pickles! They do offer a funky mix of pickled vegetables but it just didn't taste quite right.
-It's a bit on the pricey side for a not so classy joint.

The ugly:
The service was pretty bad. The waitstaff was very awkward and so was the manager. Not personable AT ALL. Absolutely no personalities. I paid attention and not one person on the staff that interacted with our table smiled...not once. I was with a group of 4 other women and 2 very well behaved kids. They looked depressed and annoyed half the time. When I told the manager that they should make it more clear that the kid's grilled cheese is not traditional and is on a thick bun he just looked at me with a straight face and said \"okay\". He wasn't necessarily rude...just so bland. The hostess that sat us needed to brush her hair...she looked like she just rolled out of bed. She wouldn't even make eye contact.

I could go on and on but the bottom line is that your food can be amazing but, if the service stinks, you won't want to go back for seconds.

(This may have been an off day for this place. The other reviews seem to be very good. Whatever the case, it wasn't an experience I'd want to pay for again. There are plenty of other burger joints in the sea!)"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is amazing. This is where I ate the BEST burger of my life. I wish it was a franchise cause I would totally invest every penny into it to bring it to NY. The Myagi-san burger changed my life, I will never look at a burger the same way again. This is not the burger that all other burgers will be judged against.

I went to Bachi Burger twice during my stay in Vegas. The first time the food was EXCELLENT. We ordered: Myagi-san burger, truffle parm fries and the kiki burger with a red velvet milkshake to go. Everything was amazing. 5  star food and experience.

The second time we went we got the Ronin burger, pork belly buns, oxtail fries and portuguese donuts. Everything was decent this time around but not outstanding like our first time there. Ronin burger was good but I felt it lacked a bit in flavor. The pork belly buns were different, but I thought they were only yummy when smothered in the sauce they came with. The Oxtail fries reminded me of just regular chilli cheese fries....the oxtail part did not really shine through flavor wise (Yelpers hyped this up so much I was kind of disappointed when I tasted it....go in with an uninfluenced mind and maybe you will enjoy them more than I did). I thought that the Portuguese donuts were a bit too dense and I would have preferred to have them served on a plate instead of in a paper cone.....sugar was everywhere. But these are very minor details. Over all the second time around I would still rate the food and experience 4 stars."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars because the food here is actually pretty good, there were just some other problems with our dining experiences here.

The good: Kiki's burgers all around for the 3 of us, and they were very flavorful. I loved how the burgers had a nice charred crisp on the outside but still fairly juicy on the inside. The toppings all worked together very well, the mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, bacon. It was nice that they left the garlic chili aioli on the side for you to spread on your burger as you please. Also, we had the salt and pepper fries along with the sweet potato fries to share. The favorite was the salt and pepper that is mixed with some ginger, cilantro, and chili peppers. The sauce also complemented it very nicely. The sweet potato fries were cooked nicely but the sauce was not good. The Yuzu citrus aioli had a strange herb taste that we couldn't place. But the best part was probably the drinks. We had the strawberry jasmine lemonade and it was so tasty! It has a fresh strawberry puree with real strawberry bits. We also had the Momotaro, which was good but I can see it being too sweet to finish the entire glass. Oh and it comes in a really large glass so it's worth the $4.

The bad: The two times my bf has come here, they have mixed his burger up with another person's in the party. He likes his burgers cooked medium-well but both times, they have been under cooked and we realized it was because the servers don't have an indicator for each burger's doneness. So while the servers remembered what each person ordered, they didn't know which burger was which.

The ugly: After eating a few bites, my bf noticed it was way underdone. So he brought it to the waiter's attention. They took away his burger and when the waiter returned, it was literally the exact same burger he originally had, only cooked again. This means they put the patty that he had taken bites out of back on their grill rather than cooking a brand new one, like they should have. COMPLETELY unsanitary! 

I'm sorry, but a restaurant that will return already eaten food onto their grill is not acceptable. So although their food is good, who knows what else they do that's not exactly kosher."}
{"text":"Wow, JUST WOW, who knew heaven was just a few files from the strip of LV...A stop I will always make in Vegas...it's just that good. I just had it 2 days from this post and I wanted it again and tried to hit it up before I left the sweet town of LV, but damned it all they are closed on Sundays, DRAT . 

Let's take this as a walkthrough, I'd like to be how very detailed in the whole experience. 

1. Walk - in, little worried b/c even with good reviews I've seen from yelp that it wasn't that busy, also the few customers we did see didn't order burgers but sandwiches. 
2. The Sit Down. It was a nice looking decor, just arriving to LV and was starving anything seemed good, but I didn't know what I was about to get into. We order some waters, get them fast because it wasn't that busy considering it was around 3 PM, We order the fries, sweet potato, the truffle oil, and garlic fries. They come out first. 
3. The fries. The Garlic fries were the first I tasted, each basket of fries come out in nice decor and although it's 4 $ each approximately for a little more than a handful you'd expect to get more, but it's really the perfect amount you need. Again well the garlic fries were great, they had good taste, and had a little kick of spice I would think from jalapeno. It was really awesome! Second I tried the Sweet Potato fries, which were cooked to the greatest form...the texture and crispness to the fries was really good. Then I tried the truffle oil fries, by themselves I thought were alright, but when you add them with the sauce / chutney that is arranged with each basket, it definitely does not disappoint.
4. The Burger, Oh goodness....the burger...it was just amazing...I ordered the Kalbi burger, and was actually reluctant b/c the waitress didn't really acknowledge it as a good choice...or even ask how I liked my burger cooked (I ususally get medium-rare, or medium), but it didn't matter...it just didn't...it was just that good. My burger had a perfect bun, wasn't soggy or anything, it held true form as I devoured my burger from first bite to last. The patty! Man if you've had Korean BBQ / Kalbi, then you know that's already money, but on this marinade on the patty! SOOOO GOOD!!!! It also had a thin layer of Kim-Chee and served with a side of pickled cucumber (ouee kimchi, is what I think it's spelled), I wish I could describe it better, there was more to the burger...but I just totally just hypnotized by it's taste. 
5. Service, I know it wasn't crowded but service was amazing, it seemed everytime I sipped water, someone would fill it to full right after I put it down. The staff was nice, give you a warm greeting and a happy good bye b/c I think they're glad to see satisfied customers, and I was most definitely one of them. 

This was the longest post I've ever written, and even posting this on my FB just to spread the word on this place..."}

We ordered 2 Ronin Burgers, 2 Miyagi-sans, 1 Bahn Mi Burger, an order of the infamous oxtail chili cheese fries, and the salt and pepper garlic fries.

And might I say, we pretty much enjoyed everything and ordered some to-go. Our service was excellent. Will be coming back here for sure!"}

{"text":"Being in a strip mall didn't make this place easy to find. Google has it facing the street but the entrance is on the opposite side. The lunch crowd was in full force when I get there. I was seated in a table for four. They don't allow eating at the bar! I felt guilty of taking up all this space when people were waiting to be seated. So I sat not facing them. Screw 'um. At any rate, I ordered a Japanese beer I've never heard of. I forgot the name but it came in a 17oz bottle. Very good beer, sorta hoppy between an ale and an IPA. Then I had the Spicy Miso burger. Wasn't spicy at all. Maybe they missed something. But was cooked perfectly (med) and had the miso taste just right. It comes with an egg so prepare for some messy eating. I didn't have any frys and stuff but I'm sure it'll be just as good as the burger. Next, I'm going to try the Hotdog. The guy next to me had one and he said it was great.
There's a Ramen place next door. You can actually order Ramen too! The Ramen place wasn't nearly as crowded as Bachi so I wonder if I can order the burger from the Ramen place. This place beats BurgR and B&B in my opinion."}
{"text":"The experience of eating at Bachi Burger is evidently experienced when actually *eating* the food, which is a wonderful fusion of Asian and American influences with no small amount of creativity on the part of the chefs. Admittedly, with some dishes the fusion can seem a tad hamfisted, you can trust that almost any dish you get can promise a reasonably satisfying novelty taste experience.

However, the severe downside to Bachi Burger is the physical establishment itself. God awful, repulsive, marketing focus group chosen music played at ear-splittingly abhorrent volumes, sure to prevent you from speaking to any fellow patron more than one and a half feet away. Sitting down and eating at Bacchi Burger is a contest between your impulse to enjoy your admittedly excellent tasting meal slowly and your other impulse to escape ASAP. The gruff and oftentimes unhelpful waiters and waitresses greatest ease is to inform you that a seating area is closed (for no apparent reason) and  greatest displeasure is to give you the time of day or, god forbid, return a polite smile.

The best way to enjoy Bachi Burger is to mercifully spare yourself the trip and order via UberEats, which, all things considered, is the godsend in all of this."}
{"text":"I'm torn on Bachi. Maybe a 3.5?
Their idea is cool and they got some neat combinations but execution is lacking some areas. 

The wait wasn't really an issue as we had a large party (8) and they just needed to setup a bit. While waiting, i scoped out the menu a bit to see what they offered.

The baos looked interesting, but it would have been too much. The party shared the ox tail chili cheese fries and they were pretty tasty. I would like there to be more ox tail, but it was good.

I got the Miyagi-san burger, medium rare, which was grass-fed wagyu, fried egg, bacon, furikake and onion strings. The sauce was a chili mayo. Also got a side of the sea salt fries.
Presentation - awesome. The burger looked great and toppings stacked nicely. Good char on the beef. 
Taste: Was just okay. Good flavors from the ingredients, but I think the flavor of the meat was kind of lacking. Maybe it was too sweet or something, but I was expecting a more savory taste from the beef. Beef was a letdown and a bit on the flavorless side. I might stick with Angus next time as I had a taste of another burger and it seemed to be more flavorful.

I think what kind of made everything a let down was the service. When going to like a pho restaurant, I expect there to be no service. But when you're serving gourmet burgers with foie gras I would hope there would be something better than what I see at a pho joint. 
The servers just seemed a tad surly. No smiles and seems to have a bit of an attitude. Kinda just going through the motions and they ask you for help. Not even in a nice way. Was just \"can you pass this down?\" no please? no thanks?

I can understand if it was a booth and the server can't get to some people. She was just lazy and started giving us appetizer plates and asked us to send them down. Same with the water. Plopped them down at one end of the table and again asked us to pass them down. I was surprised I wasn't asked to pass the food down as well. So they're able to give the food to everyone individually, but water and plates are too much trouble. Towards the end of our meal, some people are still eating, they start clearing the table right as people finish their plates. You get that rushed feeling like they want to kick you out. The fries we shared were still half full and she started to take them away. She only asked if we wanted to continue to eat them after we kinda looked at her taking the fries away. Why so quick to get everything away? It wasn't like there was a line waiting. We were eating lunch at like 2PM. No wait and restaurant was half empty. Oh, and in true fashion, she also asked us to pass the plates up and over to her so she wouldn't have to walk around to each setting and pick up the plates.

Like I said, I'm a bit torn. I think it has potential, but had a pretty eh first experience. They gotta step up their game."}
{"text":"I've gone here many times and every time I go here my experience is always great. When it comes down to being greeted, seated, and ever served. I always have a pleasant time. 

The environment vibe is classy and also modern. When it comes to the food they have a great presentation when served and plus it's delicious. I ordered a medium rare Ronin Burger and it was made just right.

I would recommend this Restuarant if you want a well, unique and one of a kind type of burger here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to stop at when you're in Vegas! Great service and great food. The banh mi burger was amazing! The oxtail chili fries are also really good!"}
{"text":"A burger joint with something different to offer, layers of flavors & textures to take it to the next level.  We had the Banh-Mi, Miyagi & Shogun.  Ranked in that order of Good, Better, Best. Also had the pork belly bao & the ox tail chili cheese fries.  Both were good though the ox tail meat was lost in that dish, meaning, they could have used other types of meat & it wouldn't change the dish.  We enjoyed our meal & it was worth the drive away from our hotel on the strip."}
{"text":"Their burgers are very good and not imitable. The Waygu beef and different toppings make this place one of a kind and blows the competition out of the water."}
{"text":"Wow!! Bachi burger proved to me that you don't always have to be a restaurant on the strip to be AWESOME! 

We decided to try something new rather than the same old restaurants on the Las Vegas strip the first night we got in. We've been always been going to the same places every time we come so we decided to change it up. Since I've heard such good things about Bachi, we decided to make the trek out the strip to some random plaza I would say 5-10 off the strip.

Upon walking in, Bachi is a fusion between Asian and modern cuisine. I decided to try their oxtail chili cheese fries and shogun burger and the bf ordered the black and green burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries were the highlight of the night!!! The oxtail was tender and flavorful and the mixture of chili was a little sweet and egg to top it off was the perfect amount of salty you needed! Ugh I just want to go back for those chili cheese fries!! My shogun burger was amazing!! Huge piece of foie gras within the burger perfectly seared and nice and fatty!! So good! 

I definitely would love to come back and try their other burgers! Their bun is so soft and they pair the best ingredients inside of it!! Such unique and great flavors!!"}
{"text":"Tried Bachi Burger for the first time and was so impressed!! I ordered the black and green burger. The patty fit the bun perfectly and the bun was soft and held together. The service was phenomenal as well. Great atmosphere! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.... Rushed over to try the oxtail chili cheese fries!!! So disappointed the fries came out cold the chili was cold!! I sent the fries back they came out warm... It's almost like the fries are   made in advance warmed and then put on the plate.... Def won't be back... The server really didn't want to be there... Horrible..."}
{"text":"So unusual to find a place like this there food is great the burgers are awesome great atmosphere highly recommended"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. All I remember is that I had a business lunch here with a colleague and the burger was amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Bachi burger a few weeks ago after hearing about how great it is.. Bachi did not disappoint! I wish the restaurant was more spacious but the service was totally on point -as was the food! It has such a unique and delicious taste. I can't remember off hand the burger I had- a mushroom burger of some sort. And the ox tail fries are a must have!! Thank you to all the staff for a fantastic meal and experience."}
{"text":"This place is well worth it. 
We had three burgers

Oxtail chili fries 
Spicy miso
Miyagi San grass fed Waygu 
Kiki 

Of the 4, by far, oxtail fries was amazingly good. I love oxtail and this was a great take on it! 

As for the burgers, I really enjoyed the Kiki the best. The mushrooms and the sauce had a lot of flavor. 

The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well. 

Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor. 

The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full. 

I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay."}
{"text":"So this place amuses me. Why? Because the burgers here, are outstanding. I mean outstanding. There's a good chance you'll come, eat a burger and decide that it's one of the best burgers you've ever had. Among your top 10 even top 5. This is how I feel about the burgers. Everything else on the menu? Craptastic. I mean, just garbage. The coffee taste like water, their cocktail barely had liquor in it, the dessert like some supermarket bought concoction, it just goes on. So just don't order anything else but the burger."}
{"text":"Had the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - very tasty (Nothing beats egg and onion rings on a burger!) & truffle fries - also tried Garlic Aoil - red velvet shake was really good. Lots of other great burger options!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp on a trip to Vegas.  The reviews had my mouth watering!  I couldn't wait to get there!  Unfortunately, when I got there for lunch on a Tuesday, they were closed!  I was unbelievably sad!  That is why, later in my trip, I made a second trip to Bachi Burger.  Boy, was I glad that I did!

I had the Ronin Burger and my wife had the Lonely Bird.  Both were AMAZING with amazing sauces!!!! Hers was better.  It had crunchy onion straws on it which just added something!  We also had sweet potato fries and Parmesan truffle fries, both of which come with heavenly sauces.  Heaven.  I was even able to get bubble tea!  They make their own homemade sodas too... My wife had a strawberry jasmine lemonade.  Very refreshing!  Prices were reasonable- about $10 a person.

Other than the wonderful food, the most memorable part of this experience was an angry woman behind me.  She apparently ordered her burger rare but when she got it, she thought it was too rare.  She proceeded to be VERY rude to every employee in the restaurant.  Even using the line \"I have worked in the service industry before.\" She said that she comes here 3 times a week and it is her husband's favorite restaurant, but now she isn't coming anymore.  Poor husband! The staff were all very nice and understanding to her even though she was acting like a crazy person. 

 All I can say, is that if I lived in Vegas, I would be there 3 times a week too!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Waiting area is pretty small but we did not have to wait long to get our food.  The oxtail fries were great and the burgers were flavorful and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"You won the east! Go west!  Village.....Square is now the new home of The new Bachi burger, and even though I've been at this location to eat many times before, this is my first time at Bachi burger. Yes this is one of those cursed locations where restaurants open and close, raising sun Turned to sunset, route 66 was too slow and others that I can't even remember faded into oblivion.
 Is time for something new, learn from the past, classic Hamburgers didn't work, Japanese didn't work, put them together and you get... Bachi burger......... Is that translates to karma burger? If it does, then that's what's coming to me, a nice and delicious juicy burger, cuz I deserve it.
 We ordered the fried calamari for appetizer, nothing different from other places, except the dipping sauces and the price, I'll skip them next time. We also had the Bahn Mi burger and the Ronin burger with The truffle Parmesan fries. Both burgers were excellent and the fries delicious. We also had the sangria special by our waitress recommendation, which it wasn't that good, a nice cold beer would've done the job.
 Yes! Bachi Burger is good, yes Bachi service is good, yes Bachi place is nice. Is Bachi here to stay? Only time will tell, and if you don't try this place  karma is gonna get you!  A new Roberto's will take over and you would only be able to eat here after  a long night of partying and heavy drinking and your taste buds are gone for the night."}
{"text":"Was ok my truffle fries sauce tasted like it was in the refrigerator for a day or two uncover."}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about this place so I finally had to try it.  I don't live in Vegas anymore but this is right by my pop's place so it was easy to get to.  They got a wide variety of different types of burgers you can order from.  So depending if you like your burgers plain, to having lots of sauce or additional toppings, you can choose how you like them.  The first time I went there I got their Bachi Burger and it was too sweet for me.  The second time I went I got the Banh Mi Burger and that was actually decent.  I got Truffle Parmesan Fries on the side that was good too.  Overall, maybe it's because I like a good ol' fashioned burger, I think this place is just okay."}
{"text":"Hibachi traditionally means fire bowl in Japanese, but the word \"Bachi,\" is associated with Karma or punishment attributed to someone, who does wrong doing.  But the \"Bachi\" in Bachi Burger is just Hibachi abbreviated, because if you've been to Bachi Burger, the Asian gourmet style burgers are the best.  Got there early, enough to beat the crowd, like 5:30pm.  The atmosphere was retro, with a mixed crowd--and I was surprised at an extensive menu to suit everyone, from children to the old--Appetizers galore, and desserts too.  For those meat lovers, Angus beef and Wagyu (similar to that Kobe steak) and the Lonely Bird (turkey chix mix) and fish too.  Love the design of this place.  As it got busy the hostess, was busy running around, should have one stationary, and one seating guests  The change in waiters and waitresses kept us busy wondering who was actually waiting on us.  But overall, it was a good experience and the burgers, were the best.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Saw this place from DDD and decided it had to be included for my diet cheats in Vegas. 
Ordered the oxtail fries $11.5 Pretty good. All the guys loved it. It was something different to try. 

I ordered the Mr. Ho's burger $9.5 and the rest of my group ordered the Kikki burger $10 and 2 Manga burgers $11. Mr. Ho's burger was good, I assume intended to have a sweet and savory balance however I think mine was more too sweet. 

The bf got the Kikki burger which I really liked. He interpreted it to be like a mushroom swiss burger. If the gruyere cheese throws you then don't worry because I didn't taste it. It was yummy to me. 

My friend who ordered the Manga burger Loved it. He described it as melting in your mouth flavors. I had a bite but guess I didn't take a big enough one bc I didn't have the same reaction. The bf said the bite he had was good and tasted like a big chunk of crab mixed in. Overall I think a good choice but it was the special for the day when we went. 

One of our friends who wanted to try and maintain his diet ordered the Ahi tuna burger. He said it wasn't anything special. He had a better one in Austin. 
I also ordered a side of the Parmesan truffle fries $4 but with the gravy on the side. Nothing spectacular. Just regular fries if you need a side with your burger. 

Overall, I will be going back to try the other burgers when I'm back in Vegas. Worth the trip to go off the strip for lunch. Also we went at about 11:30 and it wasn't packed but when we left about an hour later there was a long wait so we were glad we missed the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas over the weekend for EDC. Decided to come here after seeing it on the Food Network. 

It was HOT HOT HOT in Vegas! 105-108 degrees all weekend!

Once we arrived, there was a line. Signed up on the waiting list and found a seat in the waiting area. Unfortunately, some people were waiting outside in the heat. Some dude fainted outside...

We waited for 45 minutes. It felt like an eternity. Our waiter was super slow. Looks like he just got back from EDC....

I had the Miyagi burger (medium rare) and it was pretty damn good! too bad I didn't have an appetite..

I am knocking down 2 stars for 3 things:

1.) Turn up the A/C. I shouldn't be sweating while sitting down for 45 minutes
2.) Serve water to the people that are waiting! 
3.) The fries...SUPER HYPE...taste like chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"The ramen was pretty legit but sad to say their burger, although \"pretty\" came out dry dry dry. MED RARE BURGER was almost well and flaky meat, toasted buns no sauce, over well done egg, parched onion rings = fail.  Manager discounted bill but no offer to remake, prolly shouldn't have charged at all.  Needs focus on the flavor execution not the looks."}
{"text":"Was in town on Biz and found Bachi on Yelp.  Great food but the service was pretty slow and the food took a long time.  The waiters were friendly but spent too much time looking at their phones.  Looking at other reviews this is consistent."}
{"text":"Oxtail-chili-cheese-fries was OK, not as much ox tail as I anticipated,  sweet potato fries good, Burgers good and juicy.  aribiki sausage a bit salty."}
{"text":"This place is so addictive!  I am constantly thinking about Bachi Burger and how I want more.  The sweet potato fries are delicious, the burgers are inventive (but not so much that they taste weird).  The service is friendly.  They are always happy to explain what a menu item is if you have questions!"}
{"text":"I came in with high expectations for this place, especially with all the positive reviews already listed.  

I had the shogun burger, which I picked mainly for the foie gras.  It was good, but not $30 dollar good.  The burger itself was on the sweeter side (good or bad depending on your preference), a bit sloppy due to the sheer size of it and its layers, but I did not enjoy the soggy buns.  

Unfortunately, the poor service I received here overshadowed the food experience.  I understand restaurants get busy, but there really isn't an excuse for excessive waits and horribly bad service.

1)excessive wait to order drinks after we're sat(who is our server?)
2)wait an absurd amount of time for drinks 
3)wait more to order food because drinks were brought by someone else (where is our server?)
4)appetizers finally come out after a long wait, but more annoyingly, having some appetizers come after the main dish because it was forgotten(really?)

To top it off, receiving the wrong bill after the poor service was completely aggravating.  Of course we had to wait for our lost server to come back and tell us :)"}
{"text":"The burgers were like home made burgers. The waitress was nice. Very casual. We went when it was slow. Just thinking it was slightly overpriced. We did live the food but I feel it would be the same at home.  In other words. A home cooked burger away from home."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!! Too bad, it's all the way in Vegas...I get the miyagi burger, comes with crispy onion and an egg! I love that the buns are hawaiian buns, it adds the perfect amount fi sweetness. The oxtail chili cheese fries are to die for!! It is a MUST if you're going to eat here!"}
{"text":"Although the wait was longer this time... 45 mins... It was worth the wait!!  Will be returning each month to try ALL the burgers!   Sweet potato fries and garlic salt fries were yummmm....... See you next month!"}
{"text":"Holy burgers!!! I'm not one for burgers or to be impressed by burgers by any means but bachi had my jaw to floor. The extensive menu and range of different types of burgers and creativity is what got me. I looooove the bahn mi burger. It comes with the most outstanding fish sauce for dipping your burger, HOW COOL (not to mention creative)!!! I recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas or those who live here."}
{"text":"We've gone to Bachi Burger twice now with each visit we've made to Las Vegas.  It's an interesting menu, as the burgers are asian inspired and if memory serves, share a combination of savory and sweet in some form or another.

The first time I ate here last year, I tried a burger off the menu.  The beef was very tasty and the quality and freshness was undeniable.  Would I have made a burger like this at my place?  No.

The second time I ate here, which was last week, I requested a \"regular\" burger which wasn't on the menu because I wasn't feeling like having savory and sweet, and they obliged.  Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The food does take awhile to come out, especially if you're in a large party, so don't expect anything \"express\" style.

It's an enjoyable enough place if you don't mind the wait.  They're usually very busy.  If you're hankering for a more traditional burger, they'll hook you up with a smile. 

No complaints about this establishment.  It's in the \"take it or leave it\" category for me."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay, it was a little over-rated.  We had the Miyagi burger and the oxtail fries.  the oxtail fries tasted like the chili came out of a can.  The burger was a little too big to eat nicely.  I appreciate all the fillings, but when you cannot eat it with one bite, it's almost not a burger.

Price was a little high, service was good, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time trying Bachi Burger. Family and friends been telling us every time we come to vegas to try it out. Even when we moved here we never did get here. 

but finally one of our friends came to town and we went to go check it out. 

Area seems pretty new. very clean establishment. glad we went when it wasn't busy. 

we had the parmesan truffle fries, kalbi burger and kiki burger. i must say, taste was pretty good. kiki burger was definitely something different. our friends got the oxtail fries and miyagi burger. 

to be honest, we prefer other burger places but i wouldn't mind trying out some of these other burgers."}
{"text":"I had the kalbi burger and truffle fries. Wow. What a great meal. I came here because I saw that other yelpers seemed to like it and they were not wrong. The service was very friendly. I will return when back in LV."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and milkshakes, friendly staff, AWESOME music selection (EDM lol). This place is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Once again this place did not disappoint. I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and my best friend had the Ronin burger. Both were BOMB. Shout out to Steve for being a great server. I'll definitely be back here. Always a good locals spot"}
{"text":"There burgers are amazing! I've tried three so far! My favorite one is the one with a fried egg and onion rings on it! And there ox tail fries are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!! Saki sangria is delicious! Taste just like a fresh wine and fruit sangria! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Friday night 730 surprised there is a 30 minute wait? YES when half the tables are empty..... Why does this place have such crapy service?"}
{"text":"I am editing my post.  Our 1st visit here was a huge bust. After being seated right away, we never got menus or any kind of service.  After flagging down a waiter for menus, he just handed them to us and walked away.  No one ever spoke to us after being seated for 20 minutes!  Boom...one star review.

Fast forward 3 months.  Decided to give the place another shot.  Took my Mom here for her birthday dinner (ironic, since my 1st visit was supposed to be MY birthday dinner).  We went on a Wed. night at about 7pm.  The place was pretty busy, but we were seated right away.  Our server was AMAZING!!!!  He immediately brought us drinks, (I got the house made strawberry peach soda-excellent!!) explained the menu and made some great suggestions.  After much contemplation, we got the Parmesan Truffle Fries, the Pork Belly Sliders and I got the Kiki Burger while my mom got the Kalbi burger.   It was all sooo good!  There wasn't any food to wrap up.  We ate every last crumb!

The sliders came with this great house made hoisin sauce that made something good even better.  The Kalbi burger was spicy, but in the best way possible. My Kiki burger was sweet like carmelized BBQ.  I cannot wait to go back to this place. I am so happy I gave it another chance.  Hooray!!



Original Review:  Worst service EVER! Upon entering at 4:45 pm, there was no host for several minutes. The entire staff seemed very confused and  uncoordinated.  When a host finally showed up, we were told it would be a few minutes despite there being several open tables in sight. After being seated, we sat for 10 minutes with no one even making eye contact with us. I finally physically flagged a waiter down & asked for menus. He replied with \"yeah\"? and when I asked for the menu he gave them to us & walked away. No apology, no anything. After another 15 minutes of being completely ignored, we got up & left. When we left, their waiting area was packed with very unhappy looking people waiting to be seated,  There were still lots of tables available, but no one getting served.  We went 10 minutes down the road & had a fantastic dinner with excellent service at a tapas restaurant. By the way, this was my birthday dinner. I had chosen Bachi burger b/c I had heard such great things. What a disappointment. We will not be returning. Thanks for nothing Bachi burger.  Get it together!"}
{"text":"So, this use to be one of my favorite burger spots, but I am so disappointed in my experience tonight! First of all the energy level of the servers is very low. MANAGEMENT take care of your people and they'll take care of your patrons. Everyone looked overworked and under cared for. Speaking of not being taken care of, the restaurant looks ran down. All the tables are chipped and kept stable by placing napkins under the feet. There's a huge hole at the bottom of the booth seats. But what really got me is the cooks in the kitchen playing music that was louder than the intercom music. Not only was the music loud but it was inappropriate rap music with cursing and a lot of use of the \"N\" word. There were children in the business and I know if I was offended, I'm pretty sure their parents were too. I'm a person who enjoys rap music as much as the next person but I was utterly appalled by what I was hearing while dining at your establishment. To top it off my burger lacked flavor. You all need some serious customer service training! :("}
{"text":"Pretentious.
Kinda sums up my experience there. We just happened upon Bachi burgers driving down Windmill Lane.  The staff was friendly, but gave off this arrogant vibe \"your lucky to be here\".  Beer, btw, is $7 per small glass. So 2 beers, for 2 people, will set you back $28 !!! They feel special and don't mind raping customer wallets. The burgers were good - but not $30 good for two burgers. 
 Next time, we will just hit Smash Burgers."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Love it. And the plus side, this location has ramen! But the service at the end was slower bc it was busy"}
{"text":"These Asian fusion burgers are amazing and so unique! I've tried the banh-mi burger, ronin burger, and the turkey/chicken burger. All delicious! The only downside is the burger buns tend to get soggy quick because the meat is so juicy. The food also takes awhile to come out...I understand it's not fast food, but it seems to take a lot longer than it should. The parmesan truffle fries are so good, I can't get away from ordering them even though I keep telling myself I need to try some of their other fries (salt/pepper or sweet potato). If none of their specialty burgers are to your liking, you can make your own custom burger with a variety of options and toppings. They have kobe beef too!

They also have an extensive drink menu with home-made sodas and even Thai iced tea :D I'd recommend trying the apple lychee soda...so refreshing! For the alkies out there, they also have a wine & sake menu!"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed this place yet, but I think it's high time I stop procrastinating on it. 
This place is just amazing. Great burgers, great ramen, great dessert. On my first try I had the spicy miso burger and it was wonderful. I've been going through and trying a bit of everything since. I wish I could eat here every day it's so good. 
The atmosphere is very modern and dark with tons of tables close together. It can get pretty loud and crowded but it's worth it. The desserts are sinfully good and bad. Get the donuts on a cheat day! Those are ridiculously good!!!"}
{"text":"Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.

Wait time: Always a wait

Ambiance: Not laid out well. You are sitting in a row of 50 other people eating 2 feet next to you. It feels like a school cafeteria. Last time we came they were going through a remodel. Maybe they added a few barstools.

Food:Fries brought out 15 min before the burger. They were soggy when they brought them out. Ordered the burgers medium/well because my girlfriend just recently had food poisoning so we didnt want to take any chances. Both of our burgers came out COMPLETElY RARE on the inside. Its was seriously cold uncooked meat in both of our burgers. 

Staff: This is the absolute most horrible part about our experience. I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We first sat at a table and after no one saying a word to us for 5 minutes, we decided to move to the bar in hopes of getting some service. Sat at the bar for another 5 minutes until a gentlemen named John who I later found out was the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything.  I answered \"yes we have not been helped yet, we're ready to order\". This guy gives me the most blank stare like he was stoned out of his mind and says \"ok one second\". He proceeds to go behind behind the bar and walks over to this kid with  mo-hawk like hair who's busy making drinks and points at us while telling him something. The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away. A few moments later a girl with blonde hair comes over an takes our order. Fries come out first. Soggy and not good. We look around for the waitress or manager who are both nowhere to be found to send the fries back. Here comes the most crazy thing I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The manager walks behind the bar, grabs a bottle of Fireball Whisky, and pours 2 shots in to shot glasses. He taps the mo-hawk guy on the shoulder, hands him a shot very sneaky like and starts walking towards my girlfriend and I. Right when I was about to open my mouth to say something about the fries he bends down right in front of us pretending to tie his shoe or something and takes the shot. He literally stands up with the most disgusted look on his face (as all people have when doing fireball). My girlfriend and I both sat there with our mouths dropped open. He knew instantly that he was busted. (stealing alcohol and drinking while \"managing\") He disappeared in the back room and the mo-hawk guy went back to making drinks. Our burgers came out a few minutes later. We both checked to make sure the burgers were plenty cooked. Cold rare meat. They were slightly seared on the outside. I figured The girl didnt hear me right and rang them up as medium/rare on accident. When she came by the bar I flagged her down showing her the burger and the uncooked meat. She asks us if we want the burgers remade. I said politely to her \"no thank you, we've actually been having a really bad experience. Nothing to do with you.\" Her only answer to that statement was \"OK\" then she walked away as if she was upset for some reason? I didnt know what that meant so I sat there for another minute when she came back to the bar and says to me \"Well I checked the order and I put it in medium/well how you asked. Sorry you didnt like it\". She then drops the check on the counter and walks away. I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her \"John\" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job. They told me that he was the only manager there but the nice male server agreed with me that I shouldnt have to talk to a drunk manager about my issues. He gave me the name of the owner \"Aaron\" and let them know I was not paying for food I didnt eat and I wanted to talk to the owner tomorrow to let him know about my experience. I could show him all the problems with his restaurant starting with his so called \"manager\" who stands around doing shots instead of trying to help the business flow better. This place needs to go on bar rescue. I hope the owner sees this and does something about it. He needs to get some real staff in there with rules and that know a thing or two about customer service."}
{"text":"Tried ist once again & still Not happy. 
Tiny tiny boba Drink. 
Burger is ok. Nothing Special. Better then Mc d but Too expensive. 
Still Prefer BLT @ Mirage & Burger Place @ mandalay Place."}
{"text":"What's up with the positive reviews?  Nasty food that left me with a stomach ache and my crew hungry and unsatisfied!  Lame service too.

The No Meat Here Burger was a salty, crumbling, dried-out, disgusting, unpalatable mess.  

The chicken fingers were burnt and disgusting.  Took them home and even my dog didn't want them!  

My friend ordered an organic (no hormones) meat cheeseburger - nothing exceptional, in fact, a burger from Chili's would have been more satisfying than this place!

Tried to order a Sapporo, but turns out the keg was still frozen. My friend ordered a different rice beer, which was gross as well.  This place is a large diet NOPE!"}
{"text":"Got lost and ended up pulling over to try this spot. What a pleasant surprise!  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"It's a cozy interior with a good setup. Music selection was excellent. Had the wagyu beef burger and it was delicious. Good Rogue and Stone beer selection. Reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food with a spin focused on asian influences.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I don't know why people said the prices are high. For the quality of food the prices are actually fantastic. 

We tried the fried calamari which was amazing and one of the sauces that came with it was soooo addicting. 

I tried the Shogun burger and it was one of the best I've had in my life.

We got dessert which was the caramel marshmallow shake. They didn't skimp on the caramel and it was a perfect way to top off the meal. 

Looking forward to coming back and trying everything eventually on the menu."}
{"text":"I have to say I was flat out disappointed. I figured with the stellar reviews and amazing pictures of giant burgers and such that this was going to be a great meal. Well, seems I was wrong..  My girl and I decided that we were not that hungry, so we ordered a burger and a Dao (I think this is what they called it) sandwich to split. The Angus burger, the duck sandwich, calamari, and sangria. Only thing that I was actually impressed with was the Sangria. It rocked! It is a little pricey, a craft was $26, but was really good. So that was the highlight. Calamari was over cooked so it was like having gunny bears. The Angus burger was basted with a sweet sauce that wast my style at all. Almost like a white people BBQ sauce, you could taste the brown sugar. Now the mini duck sandwiches have potential. However, again it was so white it just wasn't right. Some spice would be nice! Flavor was okay but it was pretty blah and I would need $100 worth of them for a real meal. So, I guess I am headed back to Chinatown to savor some flavors."}
{"text":"This place is located leaving vegas pass Mandalay and pass the north las vegas outlets on las vegas blvd. Then turn left on windmill and its about three blocks in.

We got here about 10pm on a friday and the wait was 5 minutes. The waitress was friendly and ask us where we were from and then ask what type of burgers we liked and then gave us suggestions which was really helpful.

We ordered the Miyagi burger, Bahn MI burger, and truffle fries it was all so yummy!!!!. The Miyagi burger is made with waygu beef which is the best beef. The char on it was perfect. The truffles fries were yummy but I would like more sauce on it but still yummy. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened...we used to love this place and now the service is horrible. At first we thought it was just a one off, but now we gave it 2 chances and are extremely disappointed. The last time we went the woman chef in the back was yelling and scolding her staff and wait staff so loud it became uncomfortable for the entire restaurant. 
This time, I took my co-workers on a lunch break and it took us 15 minutes after being seated just to get greeted, get a drink order and put in our food order. Then it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and 40 minutes for 2 burgers! Not once did our server Rachel acknowledge us or sincerely apologize for the wait. Working in the service industry, we tried to be understanding in the beginning, knowing she had multiple tables. But after we ordered, we were her only table! How does a water and a Coke take more than 15 minutes? Rachel avoided eye contact when we tried to get her attention. We had to ask the woman cleaning about the status of our food. We loved their burgers but it's definitely not worth waiting over an hour for a consistently crappy experience."}
{"text":"BACHI BURGER
Saw this place featured on Triple D, and when I heard it was burgers with an Asian twist, I was sold, and I made it my mission to try this place if I was ever in Sin City!!! It didn't disappoint, as the burgers were absolutely delicious! The oxtail chili fries are a must-have and all the burgers were yummy, exotic, and had a nice Asian Fusion twist to them to make them stand out from your average American hamburger. Come with your appetite, as the fries alone will fill your stomach!"}
{"text":"Venue:  Bachi Burger

Decor: Cafe style....not a lot of lighting, bar area

Service: Seemed well from what I saw

Environment: Busy, Busy, Busy...very popular

Food: A little of variety but mainly Asian style Burgers
 
Prices:  You pay for what you get
 
Debbie Downers:  Long wait if you go during busy hours but that's the downer of good food
 
Conclusion: I had the black & blue burger.  That was absolutely delicious.  Very fresh.  Grass fed.  Flavorful.  The bun was tremendous.  Received a lot of recommendations from different people to try this place out.  Made my way there.  Called ahead of time and boy I was not disappointed.  Also the appetizer with the Chili Fried Chicken is something off the chain.  That sauce was amazing on that sucka........Next time I go there, i will have to try this oxtail chili cheese fries.  If you reside in the Vegas area and have not tried this place out, you really are doing yourself a disservice!  If it was located in my city (ATL),  it would be top 5....easily!
 
Overall: B+ / A-"}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of having a friend living in Henderson bring me to this place when I visited Vegas this past weekend. I would never have known about Bachi Burger otherwise because this place isn't on the strip or anything, but it's still wildly popular. We waited an hour to get seats, but that might have just been a particularly busy day, still it was worth the wait. 

I highly recommend the Oxtail chili cheese fries. It's the best chili cheese fries I tried to date, albeit their take on it is a little different from the traditional (less cheese and beans) but that's what makes it so great. 

Next, I got the Ronin burger ordered to medium well and oh man.... I always considered myself a fan of good burgers and after trying this, I'm going to have to place them in my top 5 list. 

My friend tried the Spicy Miso burger. After swapping samples we both agreed the Ronin was better. I'm definitely looking forward to trying some of the others on the menu when i come back to Vegas next time or when they open in LA. 

Definitely recommend people come out to try this place if you have the time to travel a bit off the strip."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down and eat. They have unique innovative burgers. If you are looking for your boring basic cheeseburger and fries you've come to the wrong place. During my first visit, I ordered the Shogun burger and it was the best 20 bucks I ever spent on a burger (yes 20 bucks). The beef was so tender that it just melts in your mouth!! If you're the type that likes try something different this is the place to be. If you don't you can always go to In and Out.LOL"}
{"text":"My fave burger spot. Ronin and Fois Gras are amazing. The bao and oxtail chiili fries are good. Gotta go back for more later on. Fried egg on everything fyi."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this place on Diners, drive ins and dives and so on our trip to Vegas we stopped by and tried their burger.  We tried two different ones and they were both great.  Very different as they claim it to have an Asian fusion.  We also tried the Oxtail chili cheese fries and it was awsome.  We were there on a sunday and we had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is excellent. The burgers are perfectly cooked. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. Very attentive staff, efficient but not friendly, very few smiles. Everything we had was sweet, not overly sweet, but by the end of the meal I wanted something salty. Looking forward to going back and trying something else. I know I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"bomb.com their ronin burger and oxtail cheese fries are on point. dining area is limited so get there early and make sure your party is with you to be seated. Also, their truffle fires are fire!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were good here, but what really stood out for me were the Parmesan truffle fries.  Never have I had such tasty fries before...I could've just had that for lunch!

Also the service was really good.  While waiting for our food, the manager on duty noticed my husband's water was half full & immediately told our server to fill it up.  Wow, that's rare these days - we were impressed."}
{"text":"One of the BEST burger joints I've been to! Shoutout to Guy Fieri and Triple D for the recommendation! Service was really good and our waiter was really helpful. I already knew what to order coming to this restaurant after seeing their episode on the Food Network, but our waiter told us his recommendations. Ordered the bahn mi burger, truffle fries, and red velvet milkshake. 

It didn't take that long for the food to come
out and once it did everything looked absolutely delicious. The presentation of each dish was on point and very creative. The burger was super good! It had the whole bahn mi aspect to it with the flavors/ingredients and the burger was really juicy.  The truffle fries were piping hot, crispy, and the truffle sauce took the fries to another level. Lastly, the red velvet milkshake was the BOMB and it was literally a red velvet cake in a milkshake form.

I highly recommend this place whenever you're in Vegas and a heads up, they have two locations out there. They're opening one in the West Los Angeles area and I certainly can't wait for that!"}
{"text":"Baci burger is a must! Their food is always freshly cooked, the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is cozy but trendy. I always order the Kobe burger with an egg on it but without the furikaki while my boyfriend leans towards their sensational ramen bowls. They're a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it! Find your way to Baci burger as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Ok so to start the food is actually really good and consistent. The reason i rated them lower is because of the customer service. I have been several times and usually have good service, however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian, prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion, there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait, so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian, both saw us and continued working, one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is \"How are you planning to pay?\" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money, we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded, \"i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments.\" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu) . After we go that worked out, she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders, requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order, unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier, i placed my order over the phone as a to go order, that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there, i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective. Overall I think they could improve their customer service, especially for seating. I typically wait about 5 minutes and every time i have gone it has always been between 2% and 25% full."}
{"text":"Was visiting Las Vegas and tried this place on a recommendation. Awesome burger, had the Kikis Burger, cooked perfectly. Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries are super addictive. Only drawback is the service was a bit slow even though there were many waiters. Perhaps because I was alone at the bar but still. Chef shouting out orders up was amusing, booming Asian voice. Definitely worth a shot, going to try the Ramen next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come to Bachi at least 4 times when we came to Las Vegas. We remembered the food was descent until today. I ordered Spicy Miso Ramen that was way too salty so I asked the waiter to ask  the chef to add some broth to make it less salty. We eat Ramen in Las Vegas and San Diego all the time and never had such salty broth. The waiter apologized and brought it back after 10 minutes. Nothing got changed. I didn't want to complain anymore. Just ate the very salty noodle and couldn't eat the broth. Plus, my father-in-law's Wagyu burger's meat was cold. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some friends. We looked at the online menu and weren't too enthusiastic about going. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant was quite small. The service was wonderful. The waitress was able to help is fins the right things to order. The burgers were wonderful!  My husband and I built our own which forums was the best way to order. Our friends ordered some signature burgers and loved them as well. The fries were great with some great dipping sauce. My husband liked the chipolte sauce. I liked the pineapple ketchup. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place. Very good.  The atmosphere, food, and service are great. Would recommend to everyone!! Very busy. More upscale burger, Asian style."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, fries are amazing....but service is always slow! Wait time for food is always more than 30mins and the waiters/waitresses hardly ever come back to your table unless you flag them down!"}
{"text":"This should have been an update from a previous review that I did, like 4 years ago. I don't know where that review went, for some unknown reason, it was deleted. I think it was about the chicken wings, and that I only gave them 3 stars or something. I've been back here many times since then, and this place is steadily a very good place to munch on a burger. Or anything else that comes to mind.

I recently came back here, after a couple of years, on a whim. I don't know why but for some reason, I feel like I should come back here once in a while. They say that Bachi was inspired by Umami Burger in LA. That could be true or not. But, Bachi is one of those few follow-ups which is better than the original.

I've tried pretty much the entire menu here. Burger-wise, I am one of the few that believe that their Angus is better than their Wagyu. If both meats are temp'd at medium rare, I think their Angus is much more juicier and tender then the Wagyu. Call me crazy. Or call me, maybe.

Still, to this day, I haven't tried their oxtail fries. Or maybe I did. If I did, then I think it tasted pretty good. If I haven't, then I couldn't tell you. Also, they are now connected to Shoku Ramen, so you can get ramen if you don't want a burger. Which is fine, I guess.

I'll probably be back. For some reason, I still get a little irked when I see that I've paid $25 (including tax and tip) for a burger, fries, and Coke. But, i'll get over it. Maybe."}
{"text":"The best burger i have ever tried. Be sure u try truffle fried and ox-tail french fries. Their pork bun is delicious too, my friend after ate, she kept saying about pork bun when cb hotel. Lol.
Donot forget to give a try burger with wagu beef. My husband love it so much. Reasonable price too. If u have a chance, go here to eat."}
{"text":"Very SLOW service and they won't seat you until your whole party has arrived due to the limited amount of tables. It's very pricey and when I asked if I could substitute for fries instead of onion rings that came with my burger they said no. Burger was delicious but not worth $10 especially with no enjoyable side. Might try the Sahara location  but I don't plan on coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated.  Ordered the oxtail fries which was shared throughout the table. I got the Miyagi Burger which is a wagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, onion rings, and bacon. I ordered it medium rare with cheddar cheese. This was on point and everything complimented each other. Service was good and food came out quickly.  I will definitely come here again when I come to visit."}
{"text":"Placed a phone order as I know that I don't have much time to wait on a lunch break and their food sometimes takes a bit to prepare. They required a credit card number over the phone to process the order. Against my better judgement, I gave it to them and express some serious concern over the phone and in person about being asked to provide this info. I was assured both times that nothing was charged until I came in with the card. Found out after the fact that they DID charge me twice. When I complained, they finally managed to figure out how to get me a refund and a weak apology. Other than rightfully getting back what was taken by them, there was no real attempt to right my negative impression or earn my future business. Food was good but I will never eat here again and it seems as though the staff here couldn't care less. Some shady stuff going on here. AVOID."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite burger bars in Las Vegas.  My goal is to go down the menu list and try each one of their burgers. So far, I have accomplished 4. 

Ronin burger: This was my very first burger at Bachi. It is made up of angus beef, caramelized onions, fried egg, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, katsu BBQ, and yuzu citrus aioli. So simple, but so good.

Shogun burger: The burger consisted of waygu beef & unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter, and yamamomo peach. There were so many flavors going on in my mouth, it's hard to describe the taste. Is it worth $25? Probably not. Is it worth a try? Definitely yes.

Miyagi-san burger: Another waygu beef burger. Also comes with fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, onion rings, and chili mayo. Great tasting burger. I liked how it was not messy, even though it had so much going on in it.

Kiki's burger: The most recent burger I tried. This is Bachi's version of a mushroom burger. It's made of angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrroms. There's also caramelized bacon and gruyere cheese. Sauce: garlic chili aioli and sweet onion marmalade. I like it. 

If you're feeling extra fatty, get the oxtail chili cheese fries. Pretty heavy. But SO good and savory. Get it to share!

They also serve ramen here at Bachi. I've tried one of their bowls before but it was not memorable. I don't even remember the name of it. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Just stick with the burgers.

p.s. Bachi is better than Umami"}
{"text":"Fantastic, eclectic burgers. Will definitely leave full. Great sauces for the fries. Loved the unique sodas too (apple lychee). Nice, off the strip, go-to place if you want a tasty burger for half of what you would pay on the strip!"}
{"text":"It's a rare occasion when horrible service completely outweighs good food. This is that occasion. I can no longer eat here due to the garbage fire that goes on in their front of house. Glacial service, lack of regard for the guests and just an overall feeling of contempt for the customer. After many second chances I must file this away in my \"used to be good\" folder."}
{"text":"Shogun burger, it's a sin! Surprise BBQ eel that go with Wagyu beef. Best burger I've ever had in a long time"}
{"text":"Their Shogun burger is so good that my boxer friend call it \"Committing a Foul\". It contains unagi-bbq eel, foie gras, wagyu beef and . This special fries is made with truffles and parmesan. Yes, now I can say I am ready for Las Vegas Marathon(or that is just a excuse to eat this Foul burger(^^)"}
{"text":"BadAss burger!!! Dined in with the fambam and everyone left full and happy tummy!!! Serious burger to splurge with the appetite for fusion taste...BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to this area of town and every time we drove by this place, we got more and more curious. I decided to read the reviews here on Yelp and since they're mostly all good, we finally stopped by a few days ago to try the food.

The people there are really nice. You can tell they're still getting used to the place since it's only been open less than a month and some aren't too sure how to describe some items on the menu but overall they're helpful, attentive and very friendly. The restaurant is very clean and the servers do a great job at keeping it clean. The wait for the food is a little long but haven't you ever heard: \"Patience is a virtue.\"? It just made the food taste even better.

We started with the Sautéed Edamame w/ Truffle Oil & Garlic - so soo addicting! I tried the Crusty Crab which was fantastic!! The crab cake patty was tender and flavorful and the mango-chutney sauce in it was perfect. I also had the Truffle-Parmesan Fries which were yummy!

My husband had the Garlic and Pepper Fries and the Kalbi Burger but with the Kimchee on the side. He absolutely loved it!! We were completely satisfied with the food and it is now one of our favorite spots to eat.

The GM came over to our table and introduced himself. His name's Guy and he is very nice! He told us a little about the place and made us feel welcome.

I also had; a Taro Boba Milk drink which is always good almost anywhere you go, and a Lychee Apple Soda which was yummy too even though I couldn't finish it cuz I was too full. I want to try all the other mixed Sodas that they make.

That was the other day. 
Tonight we had: The Kiki Burger and The Banh-Mi Burger - both delicious. Can't wait to try every other item on the menu, and believe me, my husband and I will!!!"}
{"text":"What a great recommendation from my fellow Yelper friend, Hope C!

I rented a car in Vegas and decided to dine off the strip. Burger joints in Vegas are a dime a dozen, so I was a little skeptical at first about driving off strip to grab a burger. It turns out that Bachi Burger served up one of the best burgers i've EVER had.

The restaurant has two locations in Las Vegas, both of which are off the strip. This means you need to access to a car (be it rental or taxi) in order to get here. This Bachi Burger is located in a random plaza 10 minutes away from the main Las Vegas Strip.

My buddies and I each ordered a burger. We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($5) and Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($10). To be honest, the tastiness of my burger overshadowed the appetizers. 

The truffle fries were good, but not great. Maybe i'm just not accustomed to the taste of truffle, especially when paired with fries. I thought the combination was a little too salty. Even with the truffle sauce, I was still craving ketchup. The fries are barely big enough to share between two people. I would opt for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries next time. 

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were good. Three buns come in one order. The pork was soft and juicy. I appreciate the use of radish to add crunch and texture to an otherwise \"soft\" dish. However, I still prefer cucumber over radish in this dish. For this reason, I favor Momofuku's version. I also believe they used excessive Hoisin sauce, which masked the intrinsic flavor of the pork belly. 

The Spicy Miso Burger was the real shining star of the meal. I never guessed that miso would go so well with a burger, but it does! The subtle sweetness and saltiness pairs well with the Angus Beef. The additional flavors from the runny fried egg and mild heat from the shishito peppers make this burger exceptional. 

If you love burgers and happen to have access to a car, by all means, check Bachi Burger out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Bachi Burger, and have had great experience at their other locations, and I decided to visit this location since it was the closest location when commuting from the north side of strip.  We got sat down rather quickly even during peak hours.  They seem to have a larger space compared to their other locations, and the majority of the crowds seem to be the local residents.

We started with the usual Ox Tail Fries.  The portion did seem a bit skimpy when compared to their other locations, usually it takes about two to three people to finish one, and the ox tail was a bit chewy in comparison as well.  

We got the Kalbi Burger and some Peking Duck Sliders for entrées.  The kalbi patty in the burger felt a bit lacking on seasoning, but the flavor was ok overall.  The duck meat on the sliders were a bit dried, it really could use more sauces.

There were three of us, but the waitress was a bit rude to one of our companion (maybe he was the only white person?), and he did not end up ordering anything in the end.  It was probably a onetime thing, I guess the bad service had made this visit rather unpleasant, usually I love Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"This is one of Bachi's latest locations, and if you are a traveler staying on the south side of the strip, this is probably the closest location for you.  This dining area seems a bit smaller their older locations, but layout theme was similar.

We started strong with their Ox Tail Fries topped with Egg, seems to be the only way to do it.  If you do want to wasteful, try to have at least 2-3 people going after this.  The ox tail was slowly braised down to perfection with texture similar to chill and topped onto the fries, and the egg just help brought out the Asianess and enhanced the flavor for the dish.

I got the Ronin burger for main course, the meat was juicy and cooked nicely, and the sauce was not really needed.  I was a fan of the coleslaw though.  We ended our meal with their Seasonal Warm Bread Pudding.  The ice cream on the side was a nice addition, and the bread was not flavored enough though, still decent, but not amazing.

Bachi Burger is one of those places where you just have to visit at least once during your Vegas trip.  Service was decent, and they were not very busy here yet.  If you dislike the food from this place, then I am not sure we can be friends... unless you are a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Shared a Miyagi burger and oxtail chili fries with my hubby for lunch. Talk about flavor-packed!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in awhile, despite the over use of floral flavors. Waitress was short, but I blame being understaffed. I honestly would eat here anytime, any day, it's amazing."}
{"text":"My husbands friend kept bugging us to eat here on our next trip to Vegas. I'm glad he did, because we loved it! The burgers are as good as they are varied. The beef was first rate. They have Angus and Wagayu, cooked perfectly. The house pickles are tasty and different. The garlic was my favorite. I had the Kiki burger, with 3 kinds of mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese and ailoi sauce,  and other half had the miso burger with fried egg. Both were 5 star delicious and juicy. The house made buns were fluffy and light. I also had the Kumai cocktail of sake, vodka, pineapple, cherry and mint. Delicious...not strong, but good. The atmosphere was hip, casual and fun. The server was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. We will be coming back!

Secondly, to 'Johnny U', if you are in fact, sadly, a real person, or an imposter, which is even sadder: Your review bemoaning the supposed asian takeover of the food universe, and the pains of being a white couple 'weird'ed out among 'oriental folk',  stupidly demanding your ketchup and mustard to put on gourmet fusion burgers, the solution to your problem is simple... like you...just put on your big girl panties, tug on those Daisy Dukes you should have quit wearing in high school and drive on over to Burger King, because let me tell you, even In and Out is too good for you."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy the night I dined. So the wait was about 30 mins. But after having dinner there is was worth the wait. 
For appetizer we had the oxtail chili cheese fries. It had an sunny side egg with it, nice touch. We also had the pork bellied steamed buns. The pork was nicely cooked.
I had the miyagi-sans wagyu burger. The onion rings and egg taste great with the burger. The others in my party had the spicy miso burger and bachi fish sandwich. They were very happy with their selection. 
I'm definitely going back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"This place seems crowded at all times, so make sure to schedule extra wait time! We were there around 11:20  for party of 6 and waited about 20 minutes to be seated.

The burgers were unique and interesting. I had wagyu burger, and I did not think the beef was better than Angus burger ( but it costs more).  My husband had spicy miso burger (angus) and that was tasty! 

I will go back there when we have out of town guests because this place is unique. I do not think we will be regulars there though. It is pricey for burgers."}
{"text":"I have had just about everything on Bachi Burger's menu.

I have been here more times than I have been to any other food establishment in Las Vegas.

This is hands down my favorite place in Las Vegas to grab a burger. I will write a new extensive review for the westside location because now that it exists I don't have to travel so far for a damn good meal.

BACHI BURGER IS HEAVEN.
EAT AND REJOICE."}
{"text":"Their burgers are delicious. My personal fave is the spicy miso because they use this delicious sauce. The angus beef patty is cooked perfectly and is well-seasoned. I tried some of my boyfriend's lamb burger. He liked it but I'm not a huge fan of lamb so it was okay. Their fries are awesomeeeeee!! So delicious. Just regular fries for me. I've had the oxtail fries but personally didn't enjoy them that much. I find most of their condiments/sauces a little too sweet (chili on the oxtail fries, pineapple ketchup). Otherwise I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Another solid burger joint!

My cousin Alex wrote of Bachi Burger as one of the best burger's voted by his mother.

The best burger I've had is Bradley Ogden's at Caesar's, but this place is way up there too.  I usually go with the Ronin burger and it is a hearty, sweet fusion burger that sits great every time I get it.  No need to upgrade to the wagyu patty, I did it once and couldn't taste the difference...angus was just fine.

I was lucky to get the surf and turf burger last time (monthly special) and it was to die for!  The mix of beef, crab and egg were the perfect combination of flavors.

The truffle parmesan fries are great!  It's a great mix of flavors with the gravy and sauce.

We tried the peking style duck buns and they were awesome.  It's a great homage to peking style duck, and they've again mixed the flavors wonderfully.

All in all, great food and great service.  It hits up your asian burger tastes, so try it for a unique burger experience."}
{"text":"If you're craving a delicious burger, Bachi Burger has the most intense flavored sandwiches. Meat, fish, chicken, and no meat burgers (vegan friendly.) large beer selection and great sides along with the great service, I highly recommend Bachi Burger.

I got the flavor packed Spicy Miso Burger (Angus Beef/Onions/Shishito Pepper/Mayo/Lettuce/Roasted Garlic/Cheese/Fried Egg/Apple Vinaigrette) with a side of delicious Truffle Parmesan Fries. Everything about this burger was perfect, starting with the super soft bun to the fried egg."}
{"text":"Place hands down sucks.. Got here at 5:20pm with my girl. Ordered a spicy miso burger and a kiki burger and parm truffle fries and sweet potatoe fries.. took them 45-55min To bring out the food. Dude comes in 10 minutes after us with his kid gets the exact same thing as I did And gets his before we do. Family of 5 comes in 20 minutes after us and they get their food before us. Waiter never bothered to come and check on us..at all until after we got the food. Mind you the place was not busy at all. Never again. Stay away people."}
{"text":"OMG once again the wait at the door
it must be how the staff is trained told make a line so we look good. All bar stools empty and 3 empty tables on burger side and 3 on ramen side( i looked) its been the emptiest ive ever seen bachi burger at 630 pm. It was like she was about to seat us but hen says wait how many? 2? whats yr name? 
Joey ok it will be 15 minutes! im like wtf 15 minutes for what? i put up a stink embarrassed the wife and low and behold our table is ready in 30 seconds.

We visited because we saw Bachi burgers on food network.   It was a drive from the strip, lots of lights but well was worth the drive.   Great dinning experience.   I didn't want a regular Berger and I didn't get one.   I got the spicy Miso Berger and my husband ordered the Ronni burger.   We tried both and they both tasted excellent.   I would come back and would recommend them to others."}
{"text":"Not all that good, my burger tasted burnt on the outside and was really pink on the inside. Really greasy. Fries came after my husband already at his burger. Who runs this place? Like the set up is terrible. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty busy but we were still seated right away and the food came out quickly. Pretty spacious inside too. 

I ordered the Pork Belly Buns and I really liked it! I kind of wish they would cut it up a little bit because i would basically bite into it and it was a little difficult to break it up. I loved the bun and the flavor was good!"}
{"text":"both my husband and I got sick. Yea I just can't even come back...like ever. I'm not sure which part of the meal got us like this but we were messed up."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one day after work with some friends. Last time we had came here was when this location was the \"Healthy\" Bachi or whatever it was called. Now that this location changed to the usual burger serving, we had tried this out. Originally i had wanted to try the Shogun Burger because i love unagi and wanted to try this wagyu burger with unagi and seared foie gras. But i became cheap and my friend told me it was not that good, so i opted for the Kiki's Burger..... or rather all of us did. Lol !

Kikis Burger - Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli. 

Cooked to a medium. Perfect temp for burgers. Not too rare. Not too cooked. Nice and juicy. I havent had Bachi in a long time but i feel like the burgers reduced in size. I'm not much of a fan of eating burgers but once in a while, its ok. Though its probably been a good few years since ive been to Bachi. Oops? Burger was nice and flavorful. I didn't notice the variety of mushrooms in the burger though. Garlic Chili Aioli is delicious. Love garlic anything.. AND its spicy ! yum ! Lol 

Close convenient location for those in the SW. Usually kind of quiet though because its in a kind of \"awkward\" quiet location off of Russel, near Rainbow."}
{"text":"So sad that I had to take the time to write this first of all because I loved it here. First they told us they didn't have any noodle soups  prior to us being seated which was one good thing. They were out of everything, no mixed drinks, out of every beer I asked for so I was tired of asking and said so what do you have? My kids ordered there food and they come out 10 min later and say there out of what they ordered. It was freezing while we were eating, unpleasant eating experience as I couldn't take it and informed them were done and we had to go and eat at pizza rock for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Finally getting around to this update.....
Why you ask? Cuz I Iam so sad that this visit 2 weeks ago was HORRIBLE! From the Host, to the server (who didn't want to be our server!!!) even the manager couldn't follow thru~
  A 20 min wait to be seated turned into a 40 min wait~ well that's OK CUZ these burgers are worth the wait!!!! NOT THIS NIGHT THEY WERENT!!!!
   Get seated, wait 15 min for server to approach, ONLY to find out she will ONLY be getting our drink order ~ OK, we get it the server in our station is in the weeds...(or overwhelmed for u not in the biz) We get our drinks rather timely, 10 min. She's back about 10 min later saying \" I guess I am your server after all\" WTF???? OK...we order, & her parting words \"it will be 30 min for ur order\" COME ON! 2 BURGERS??? 
    We get it, they're busy, however the restaurant wasn't full ~ about 7 empty tables and they're not near closing time yet~
   I am gonna cut 2 the chase~ our burgers had to be sent back, manager said he'd be back by, he DIDN'T! 
   The ONLY THING THAT CAME FAST WAS THE CHECK!!! And she ran my CC in record time, picked up the signed receipt before the ink was dry and was gone......
    I am not sure what all the issues where on this night, I have been here numerous times & will return again cuz everyone deserves a 2nd chance~ Hopefully this was just a blip on their radar."}
{"text":"My family and I visited today. This was our 2nd time at Bachi Burger. Our 1st visit was great, but a couple of years ago, and we decided to go again today. Let's just say it was not a pleasant experience. The service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter was SUPER slow, came back to our table multiple times telling us things we were ordering were out (mini corndogs, crab artichoke dip, bison for the bison burger, to name a few). He took at least 20 minutes to bring our drinks, recommended an appetizer, but when asked questions about it, he couldn't answer. We could see him reading the bartenders book to mix a drink that was ordered, and it left a lot to be desired. The food was decent, not as good as we remembered, but not bad, which is the only reason for the 3. The service was the worst part of our visit. I do not plan to visit again."}
{"text":"Damn, what? This place shot up the list of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.

I'll start with the burgers. First of all, there wasn't one burger OR sandwich I did not want to try. Everything sounded absolutely delicious. I wish I had a slider of each them. I ended up getting the kiki's burger and it was just what I expected. All the ingredients (garlic chili aioli, gruyere, all the Asian mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, caramelized bacon) came together really well on top of the angus beef patty. Although I gravitate to simpler burgers (i.e. Father's Office Burger in LA), this burger was just a burst of flavor. It was inventive and delicious.

Now for my favorite part of the meal: the oxtail chili cheese fries. After my first bite, I seriously exclaimed: HOLY CRAP WHAT IS THIS. It was insanely delicious to me. The fries were incredibly crispy, and the oxtail with the chili was just superb. Topped with cheese and a fried egg, damn. It just doesn't get better than this. I would never think to put oxtail on chili cheese fries, but props to the people who figured this out.

Every time I come to Vegas, this is where I'm going to want to eat."}
{"text":"Five star oxtail chili fries but rest of food was weak tonight. Horrible service tonight.  Staff seems overwhelmed.  I'd say management problem.  Ramen menu not available and food and drinks taking twice as normal.  Not what I've experienced the last 10 times.  Men's bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price. I recommend trying the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries. The restaurant is nice and our server was very friendly and gave great suggestions. It can get pretty packed during the weekends so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"If you have ample time to spare (60-90 mins minimum) then you should be fine dining here. I've eaten here twice and both times were just okay. The ramen isn't extraordinary, but it's filling. Burgers are good and cooked according to taste. I ordered pick up once and they said it'd be ready in 30 mins. One hour later I got my order (1 burger, gyoza, ramen). The broth was cold and it was unusually salty. Dine in was slow and it's hard to get the attention of staff. Definitely could use improvement in the customer service area, because food usually tastes well."}
{"text":"I never knew a burger could taste this good! I had a gourmet burger special that wasn't on the typical menu. It was stupendous! What I enjoyed most ironically was their chili cheese fries because it had egg in it. That doesn't sound great, but it really was delicious. I also had their green tea iced tea. It took a while to grow on me, but then I kinda enjoyed the idea of it! 

The atmosphere is quiet and the restaurant is clean. It is conveniently located next to the Regal Movie Theatre. Our service was good.

I think the major set-back for me is the cost. The experience was worth the cost, but I am not sure that I would frequent the establishment due to the cost."}
{"text":"This place was an interesting fusion of different asian flavors. I had a bite of the burger and chili cheese jalapeno fries.

It was really nothing special. I can't even remember how it tasted.

Service was good though, very sweet. And you can buy the artwork on the wall!"}
{"text":"Ordered the maygi burger. Have always loved Bacci, do not even mind the long wait. Not so this time. Asked for rare burger. Not only did it come well done, but the burger itself was half the size it has always been in the past, looked like a McDonald's burger size. My fried egg was over cooked, no runny yolk anymore. The only reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 2, is because manager came right over to rectify problem. My husbands burger was also very small. Will try it one more time for deciding factor on weather to return again."}
{"text":"Friends were raving about this place so I figured I'd give it a try.  It was just okay...the picked veggies to start were good but the burger had too much going on - who needs two sauces and four toppings to make a burger taste good? Also our truffle fries were soggy and the wine pour ($9 for Cab) was about 4 ounces...kinda skimpy.  I vote for LBS at Red Rock Casino"}
{"text":"The food is good. We ordered 4 burgers and the ox tail cheese chili fries. Btw they don't serve the boba anymore.

Just one little comment. The service is slow for a small restaurant with several servers."}
{"text":"I effin' love this place.  Kalbi burger?  Yes please.

You guys need to open one of these in Chicago.  I will be at your door the day you open, like a hungry, hungry stalker."}
{"text":"I would visit Bachi Burger again for sure! Try the Oxtail fries if you want some yummy Chillie cheese fries.

Service was on point and the place was neat and clean."}
{"text":"We came here, on our way out to Primm Valley to do some shopping.  A person in Houston actually reccomended stopping here. It was only later on that we found out this restaurant had been featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins.  

So glad we stopped here.  It's really a unique burger experience.  If I had to describe this place, I would illustrate it as a higher end burger joint, with a Japanese hint to it.

The burgers are freakin awesome.. Wow..  

We started with a couple of beers and the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries. My wife is not a chili person at all and she actually like the chili cheese fries. For her to like this dish says a whole lot about the wonderful flavor.  The dish was featured on Food Network and it lives up to the hype folks.  

For entrees, my wife had the 7 oz Bachi Angus Burger.  On the reccomendation of the waitrees, I tried the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger.  

Both were oh so very flavorful and had a nice aftertaste as well. You wouldn't think of a burger as having a good aftertaste...these did...

Give it a try if you are out and about in Las Vegas and have a hankering for a good burger."}
{"text":"I don't think I could ever eat burger again, thanks to Bachi Burger.  I ordered the black and green, Wagyu beef, medium rare.  It did go down good, but at 2:30 AM, it then came back up.  I couldn't keep anything down, even water, for 24 hours, and had to cancel a business trip as a result.  

I'm trying to figure out what was it that made me so sick?  The beef, the blue cheese, the spinach.Or did someone not wash their hands?   I will never know but this experience was one of those defining moments. If I ever muster the courage to eat a burger again,  no more medium rare burgers for me,"}
{"text":"Bad customer service from almost the entire crew working except the pregnant lady. She was very helpful and attentive to our needs. I had to ask for a refill. Not once did we see our waitress. Not to mention the young Caucasian male host asked a few table around us if they  needed anything not once stopping by to ask us until my husband flagged him down to ask for a refill. There were many workers around just not helping like I said the only one was the pregnant lady. That's sad! We also ordered the Black and Green burger I believe that's what it's called and it was bland also they forgot to put one of the main Ingredients \"blue cheese\". So we asked worker since we never saw our waitress and his response was what would you like me to do. Uhh? Why do we need to answer that when yiu guys messed up on our order. Anyways he brought us two sides of it and the burger just sucked having to add your own ingredients when it should come already with it. In my opinion I would stop by the other locations and hope they have better customer service and make their customers feel welcome cause we didnt at this location.  I will NOT return here!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite meals while I was in Vegas last week.  I cannot forget Bachi Burger.

I usually eat Asian food 95% of the time.  Until I went out to Vegas.  Coming from San Diego, I'm used to eating some pretty darn good Asian food which I haven't been able to find around the Strip.  I was talking to my cousin and he suggested I tried Bachi Burger.  He said that they had some pretty good Asian inspired burgers.  Hmm.  Asian fusion burgers.  Sounded interesting enough for me to drive there from center strip area.

Ok, now this place isn't close to the strip but its definitely worth it.  We came here on a week night at around 6pm.  I had the Ronin burger and my GF, the Kalbi burger.  I was impressed as soon as I saw my burger.  Wow, this thing was a mini-monster.  I loved my Ronin burger.  The Kalbi burger was pretty good too but the Ronin was definitely a winner.  Oh and the parmesan truffle fries... awesome!  I wish they came in a larger size.  4 bucks is a lot to spend on fries but the taste was bangin.

I wish they opened a Bachi Burger here in San Diego.  I'd be a regular customer, no doubt.

note.  Weekday late afternoon traffic on LV blvd past the airport is a ______ !!!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience at Fleming's where I wanted hubby to try their brioche burger, we went to plan B and hit the foodie jackpot.  3 fabulous experiences in a row (see my other 2 reviews at JW Marriott n Hash House A Go Go) We heard about Bachi Burger on Triple D.  And yes, I have to say these burgers are off the hook!  For starters, we ordered the oxtail n chili over fries.  Yum.  Then, I ordered the signature banh mi (Vietnamese fusion) burger and hubs got the spicy miso burger.  Kiddo ordered the grilled cheese.  Hubs stated he could tell the beef was really fresh, not frozen.   I tried a bite of the spicy miso burger which was very delicious.  However, one bite of the banh mi burger and I was in foodie heaven.   The crunch of the bean sprouts and mint leaves gave it a unique freshness parallel to cilantro in salsa.  If you're a fan of pho, check it out. 
The service was friendly.  Chris was super nice and our food arrived timely. 
The décor is industrial, modern and clean.  There's a certain warmth to this place.  
For sure, we'll be back or may check out the original location.   I can't wait for this place to open in L.A.!"}
{"text":"Bachi burger serves asian fusion burgers. 

One word for this place: innovative. 

That being because the different choices of burgers and sauces, etc all compliment eachother with all around goodness. No burger is the same. & they don't use the standard mustard and ketchup. 

I always order the Ronin burger. Something about that combination of flavors keeps me comin back for more. Everytime I think of bachi, I think of that flavor! I've been conditioned to it! :)

The ronin burger contains Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, Katsu BBQ, miso goma dressing, and the yuzu citrus aioli. All in between two warm and soft hawaiian sweet roll buns. The beef was cooked to perfection - medium rare, just the way I like it.  

The oxtail fries are a must try. They load up the plate with pulled oxtail meat with cheese, chili, and a fried egg. The fries were perfectly hot and crispy. 

The Parmesan truffle fries are a great side as well! They too have that same crisp and hot (fresh from the fryer) texture and man oh man I love those esp with the side of sundried tomatoe aioli sauce. They also have ketchup on request AND pineapple ketchup if you want a kick! 

I notice that they also have special seasonal items that are always changing and they are usually unique as well so keep your eyes peeled!! 

Their beverage menu- again, unique and fun. They have different sake combinations as well as different types of beers. My bf really likes their Japanese white beer Hitachino Nest White Ale. I've tried and it and it makes a great pair with any of their burgers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two months and I'm obsessed with this place! I ordered Kiki's burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries. 

Kiki's Burger- (Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli) The sauce that comes on the side is delicious and a little spicy. I like to put it on the burger and dip it as well.

Truffle Parmesan Fries-(Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini
Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli) Delicious and one order is big enough to share!

Atmosphere- They usually get busy in the evening so be prepared to wait. This is a pretty small restaurant considering their popularity. The decorations and creative and give a nice vibe to the restaurant.

The total for two burgers, one order of fries, and two drinks was about $30, not bad!"}
{"text":"If I lived around the area, I'd probably be here very often and probably very heavy but YOLO (is that still the catchphrase of the day? lol).  We ordered:

Miyagi-San burger:  This was pretty good! It has bacon, fried egg, onion rings, chili mayo and furikake (which is apparently a seasoning..thanks, Google).  After staring at pictures, this is one of the burgers you must try.

Ronin burger:  This burger has Japanese cole slaw in it which I've noticed was just added slices of that red ginger you get when you eat at Japanese restaurants.  There's also caramelized onions, fried egg, yuzu citrus aioli, katsu bbq and miso goma dressing.  I've only tried this and the previously mentioned burger but this one was my favorite.  Actually, we both liked this one the best.  If you're generally not a fan of ginger (like moi), you will hardly taste it and you'll survive.

Salt & Pepper Garlic fries:  I asked for recommendations on the fries and was told to get this one since it was the waitress's favorite.  It has jalapeno, sea salt/pepper and surprisingly more ginger than I was expecting, which didn't make it that great for me.  Get this if you are, again, a fan of ginger.  We couldn't really taste anything garlicky about the fries (and the sauce as well), but more of the jalapeno.  It comes with an amazing garlic chili aioli sauce.

Truffle Parmesan fries:  We really liked this one the best (compared to the other fries).  There's black truffle porcini cream on the fries along with a sun dried tomato aioli.  I think we liked these fries mixed with the garlic chili aioli  together.

Milk tea drinks:  These were THE most bland drinks we have ever had with its non-sweet flavors (honeydew and lychee) and too soft tapiocas.  

For drinks, I was told that they do make their own beverages and I did see this one soda that seemed appealing (apple and lychee).  Other than that, we look forward to our next Vegas trip and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new burger favorite.  And will be one of those iconic vegas eateries I HAVE to eat before heading back to LA.  

I was so impressed.  Foodwise.  Their service was lackluster as they were understaffed. And our server was seldom seen.  

I had the shogun burger. But eventually, tasted everyones burger at our table. everyone had something different and everyone couldn't stop raving about their burger.

i think my favorite was the miyagi san. Egg, Fried Onion Rings and a zesty patty. MM MM!!!

Also notable are the bao sandwiches.  They tasted amazing.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. 

I would end the review there because I refuse to spend more time on this place (and hope that no one else wastes their time either) but I guess this deserves some explanation. 

Got here a little before 1 PM and was seated with the boyfriend. We were handed menus by a girl who said, \"Uhhh I'll let you have a minute to look this over and then send someone over.\" Uh oh. Already knew that no one had any clue what they were doing and could already tell this was not going to be a good indication of what was to come. 

5-10 minutes go by and we haven't even gotten drinks yet - or have been able to order them for that matter. We push our menus to the side and gaze at the workers behind the counter to see if someone is going to wait on us. A guy finally comes by and takes our order after explaining that there was some issue with the computer. Rule #1: The customer doesn't care what is wrong. We are just hungry. Let us order and just apologize quickly for the wait. 
When I ordered my edamame I physically had to point to the item on the menu since he wasn't sure which of the three I ordered. No, I'm not kidding. 

5 minutes after ordering we finally get our drinks - water. Yes it took about 20 minutes to get water. About 5 minutes after that we get our edamame. It doesn't look like the truffle oil and garlic oil edamame I ordered and I ask him if this is the correct one. He says yes and walks off. Well guess what? It wasn't. It was the chili one. I physically pointed to the menu which one I wanted, then ask as it is set down if it is the correct one, and it's not? It's not like there are 100 different edamames on the menu - there are three. Had to get his attention to get us a new batch which came out a lot quicker this time. It was good, but had too much garlic oil that overpowered the truffle oil, and it was way too oily. Each piece was dripping - not too appetizing. 

The waiter comes by a couple minutes later to give us the sweet potato fries (which were very very good, although I didn't like the sauce too much) to tell us our food is ready but they're waiting on the pickles. WTF? Then he tells us he is going on break and someone else will be covering our table. Right. Food comes out a couple minutes later. The grilled cheese I got was okay, but totally not worth $7. Matt got a Ronin burger which he thought was alright as well but didn't like some of the mix of flavors. The same waiter who I guess didn't go on break comes by and asks us if we want dessert which we say no, and then asks us if we want the check and hands it to us. 

We walk up to the counter to pay and I hand it to the girl there and say I am going to be paying cash. SHE WALKS OFF. SHE FUCKING WALKS OFF WITH NO EXPLANATION TO GET FOOD AT THE COUNTER. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Our waiter comes by a minute later, my mouth agape and I pay and get out of there. 

I said in a previous review that Macaroni Grill was the worst service I have ever had, but this takes the cake. I would rather exclusively eat at the Macaroni Grill for the rest of my life than return to Bachi Burger. All in all it took us over an HOUR to have what at other places would be a quick 30-40 minute lunch. No one knows what the hell they are doing and they also seem like they don't care either. The food was alright, but not enough to make me ever come back with that kind of service or lack thereof. Jesus Tap-dancing Christ on a cracker, if you hold your sanity dear to your heart do not go to this place because the service is absolutely appalling and I refuse to return to this establishment because of it."}
{"text":"I'm back home in Cali and I already want to go back to Vegas just so I can eat here again!  I saw the Ox-Tail Fries on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and I craved it so bad.  It was really good.  The fried egg on top just made it even better.  The ox tail meat was savory and soft, melt in your mouth.  I tried the Ronin Burger, which is the most popular but I didn't really like it.  There was too much carmelized onions which I usually love but it made the burger too sweet.  My husband had the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger and it was so awesome!!  I ate half of his burger.  It was really savory and just good.  I wanted to try their Boba drinks but I was too full after.  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is the most amazing place on earth. This is for sure apart of every trip I take to Vegas. It's refreshing to go into a restaurant and see a variety of folx. Often places that are super good have a particular clientele but this place has all genres. The plantation sweet tea w/pineapple and mint is the most flavorful beverage and I've tried to duplicate it at home and it's not the same. The best thing here is the oxtail fries. It's Spicey and sweet and yummy in my tummy fries w/egg and oxtail so who doesn't want that. In terms of a meal I get the non ground beef items bcus I feel some sort of way abt it but the first time I came I got the pork belly buns and they were a nice surprise. The pork is crispy and I actually like the mixture of varieties of crunch and softness. However this time I got  the Lonely Bird which was perfect. This thing seriously has a nice bun and all the flavors jus taste nice in my mouth. Anyways my friends had the Banh Mi and Mr Ho's which of course are delissshhhh. My advice go of the strip and eat and explore but clearly you are if your reading this review."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the Boy to try something different after partaking in an afternoon filled with civic action.

Upon walking into BB we were greeted and seated. After checking out the menu we settled on the \"Miyagi-san Grass Feed Waygu Burger which consisted of the following...

Chili Mao
Fried Egg
Furikake Caramelized Bacon
Crispy Onion Rings

This was to be accompanied by an appetizer that would substitute the side fries we would have to order. That consisted of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  That was made with...

Fries
Cheese
Chili
Garlic Aioli
and a Fried Egg.

After having ordered...I noticed that there was a board posting the daily specials...I was sad that this was not brought to my attention prior to ordering.

The Boy drank one Root Beer and I had a very delicious Plantation Sweet Tea.

After consuming the above items, I found them to be OK and not worth hating or truly loving.

The service was awesome as I think I must have seen at least five different faces that checked in to see how things were going.  

The real ball buster was the check. Granted this is not some trendy joke joint up on the strip it on Windmill and Bermuda for Christ sake's..but the total was why was basically two burgers, one fries w/ toppings and two drinks was $51.89 without tip...I digress we also got a Peanut Butter and Chocolate shack too. $51.89!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Even better that they are now serving ramen! How do I choose after a night of drinking??? Ramen or burger??? Both?! Yup, I did both."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bachi Burger and I will definitely be back. I work in the evenings and by the time I'm off, most places are closed so I'm extremely happy to have found another late night place I can enjoy dinner at.

The Miyagi San burger was amazing. Hands down the best burger I've ever had. We also ordered a side of fries with the pineapple ketchup which were good as well. The portions were great and filling.

On top of that the service and management were wonderful.

Can't wait for my next experience here."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service totally sucked.  I'd rather have Holsteins at the Cosmopolitan, but that's just my preference.  Oh well, you can't win'em all!"}
{"text":"Ok so when I heard of this place from my buddy Jon D, i had to go at least check it out.  And I would agree with him 100%, perfectly 4 stars.  Not quite 5 stars, needs better desserts.  Our table of 11 people had tried all the desserts and I would say that the custom pop tarts were by far the best.  The Portuguese Doughnuts were quite overdone and very hard and worst yet oily/greasy.  

But lets concentrate on the positive shall we?  Well the service once you get past the long wait.  And in our case our table of 11 people, we were told that it would 1:20 minutes wait.  Any by reckoning, they had drastically underestimated the time, since it was Black Friday and there were so many people there.  But we got very lucky and a party of 6 people had decided to just bail and take off, so were pleasantly surprised at the short wait time of only 1:10 minutes. 

As for the food, it was as I like to say \"pretty ok\".  Nothing stuck out as awesome and nothing was completely a Fail either.  We had ordered most things on the menu.  Kalbi burger, Mr. Ho's, Peking duck bao, pork belly bao.  All in all a good list of choices available for you to eat.  Fries were pretty good.  Drinks were also good. 

Now for the one sour point.  Well i have to take a star away, as the service here was a bit on the leisurely side.  It could take them about 20 minutes before they would come back to get you something that you asked for.  This happened several times, no napkins, and also quite some time to refill drinks.  Now I will say that perhaps it was more the short sighted manager on duty, who probably didn't expect that Black Friday would be so busy?  But I think they were understaffed this night.  

Otherwise I can't wait for the LA branch to open up in a bit.  I was just in the Sawtelle area of LA over President's weekend, and saw the sign that they were coming soon.  It was rather bitter sweet, as they took over from a small Mom N Pop grocery store.  But alas progress marching on."}
{"text":"The crab burger is a must ahh it's so good and filling. Also the chili wings are to die for!! Oh and the chili fries oh man oh man so good with a nice kick to them. The milkshakes are all so good too. Nice atmosphere good serves and over all a good place to dine in."}
{"text":"I've never before had a burger and fries that I've had to excuse myself from the table and go to the bathroom to clean myself off after the foodgasm."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've ever had in my entire life. Steam pork buns are excellent. Truffle fries are legit."}
{"text":"It good. I like a lot. Just ate a ronin burger with parm truffle fries on side. Soothes your deep inner yearnings. Stomach is smiling."}
{"text":"I would love to give bachi 5 stars.... However they lack a good manager. There's constantly issues that could be a simple fix yet it never happens. Over the last year there has been three different managers that I've seen and unfortunately they all lack being able run a restaurant. If I owned bachi, I'd be very disturbed with how it's ran. So, now newly remodeled, and has a bar that took up at least 30% of seating room... And doesn't serve food... There are some things with this place that may never make sense. But hey, they have a decent burger!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is one of my favorite burger spots in Vegas due to the fact that it is completely different than most places. I have been here several times and I still haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had never hear of this place, but it was close to our hotel in LV, and had a good Yelp rating. Apparently it was featured on a cable food show. My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday evening around 6. When we arrived, seating was available, but shortly after being seated, the place filled up and there was a line at the door. We ordered the Bachi Pickles, and found them delightful. My wife had the BBQ Bachi Angus burger, and I ordered the Ronin Burger. We split an order of Sweet Potato fries fixed in the Parmesan Truffle style.The food was served in an appropriate amount of time, and it was hot and delicious. The portions are quite large, but the food was so good we stuffed ourselves. 

Our server was friendly, competent and knowledgeable. Although the restaurant was full, and there were families and kids, the noise level was not overly loud. We were able to carry on a conversation without straining to hear each other. It was a very happy and fun experience, and we do plan to return when we are in Vegas again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great fusion burgers service is ok. I didnt expect burgers which is completely american with  some asian flavors like MIso, Umami Sauce, cheese, Kimchi make it into burgers would be so good, french fries also has some twist garlic parmesan and  ox tail chili fries was a good twist."}
{"text":"When we first discovered this place several years back, it was new, unknown, typically empty, and completely wonderful. Now, due to that darn mystery of social media, everyone knows about it, you have to wait even if you arrive during off hours, but... it is still wonderful! 

They've really kept the quality and fun! We're regulars when we can spend some time in Vegas. Perhaps we'll move to Vegas just so we can eat here more often :-)"}
{"text":"7:00am Friday, December 20th. I woke up hungrier than usual. I had frosted wheat for breakfast, not exactly what I had in mind. I fueled up on coffee and was feeling jolly enough to even pick up my co-workers orders. I knew we had food coming in for lunch at work so I wasn't too concerned with that. My main concern was dinner. What to eat for dinner?

 

Bachi Burger.

 

For those of you who are unaware of what this is don't worry; I'm about to drop some knowledge on you like you've never heard before. Actually, it's pretty simple. It Asian fusion brought to the all American favorites. It's as if a cheeseburger has relations with a geisha and they had a child. It's an amazing combo that I need more of in my life.

 

I text my buddy Dave and it was on. Dave and I have a love for food that can only be examined on a neurological level. When I text him, he was already preparing the same text o be sent to me. It's like we have ESPN or something, a 5th sense if you will (that's a Mean Girls reference, I'm well aware ESP is considered the \"6th sense\"). We made plans to meet at 8 and as I backed into my spot I discovered I had even parked directly next to him without even knowing. It's a food friendship made in heaven.

 

Anyways, we made our way in and did everything in our power to make it non-look like a Grinder meet up (that's the gay Tinder). In his words, it was a \"gentlemen's gathering over fine foods.\" Right off the bat he knew what he was getting as he had spent time on Yelp prior to the meet up. It took me a little more time.

 

When the waiter arrived, we ordered like two kids recently kicked out of fat camp. I ordered the Ronin Burger with a side of Parmesan Truffle Fries. He ordered the Banh Mi Burger with a pickle plate on the side.

 

Now, the Ronin burger was the tits. In fact, it probably will be one of those burger I look back and tell my grand kids about. Dave's First bite of the Banh Mi was also love at first bite. After the first bite he concluded it was the best he's ad n his time in Las Vegas. The Ronin was made with Angus Beef (miso glazed), Asian slaw, caramelized onion, miso goma dressing, Katsu BBQ sauce, a fried egg and a Yuzo Citrus Aioli. Fuck me right? And Fuck me it did, right in the mouth. It was amazeballs right down to the bun it was served on. The best part, it stayed in tact the whole time. This is one of the most over looked concepts of a good cheeseburger. If it falls apart, it could be the best burger in the world but it would get points taken off because it was over topped. The Banh Mi was something only a mad genius could dream up. It also had the Miso glazed Angus but came with Pork-Shrimp Lemon grass Pate, curry aioli, pickled veggies and nuoc nam sauce. It was similar to the scene in Step Brother where Rob Riggle can't stop saying \"POW! Right in the Kisser!\"

 

The truffle fries were on point. I had the pleasure of having these once before and the second time was no let down at all. Shoestring fried with white truffle oil, porcini cream, Parmesan reggiano and a side of sundried tomato aioli. The pickle plate was also right up my alley. Pickled, beets, cauliflower, garlic, daikon and shallots. The beets took the cake. Dave's a bit of a connoisseur of the pickled arts so I took his word for it and gave my thanks.

 

All in all, it was an awesome meal as per usual. Definitely a good place too eat at a slightly above blue collar pricing. In the words on Nike, if someone asks you to go, \"Just Do It.\"

{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all very Poor service and the management is very rude.. I waiting for a table for over 30 min as they kept seating people before myself and my family after talking to the person that was at the counter he was rude and very like I was with my family.. there service is terrible as there was tables free but they could not organize what needed to be done to seat more people.I would never eat there after this experience and I would not recommend people to eat there!! If I was the owner of this business I would certainly be looking at the service and the stuff they employ."}
{"text":"The food here is great, wonderful american-asian infusion."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger anywhere. I frankly don't understand how you can not like their burgers. Compared to the competition of gourmet burgers out there this place is very very reasonably priced. Everything is always cooked perfectly with a nice crust on the patties and perfectly medium on the inside. I highly recommend the miyagi San, it is out of this world. I come here at least 2 times a month and never get sick of it, every one of my out of town friends have said its the best burger they've ever had. Can't recommend or enough"}
{"text":"I used to rave to people how great this place is. Don't get me wrong, the food is still delicious; however, last weekend I came by and have decided that I will not go to this location again. We got into the restaurant the same time as a large party of 7. We stood behind them as they were getting greeted by the employees. Looked like it was a server that was setting up their table. He cleaned off the table for them and put together tables to form a big one. At this point, we were still standing behind the large party. About 6 minutes later, the server sat the party. We then were able to move up closer to the \"host stand\" and waited for our turn to get seated. Nobody greeted us, nobody looked at us. The server that sat the large party kept walking pass us back and forth as he was getting the large party water and asking if they had questions on the menu (keep in mind that the large party was seated right next to the host stand, so we were for sure within sight). I kept trying to make eye contact with someone, but nobody seemed like they were paying attention to the host stand. After about another 7 minutes, someone finally saw us and said \"someone will be right with you,\" which still took another minute for a server to come greet us and seat us down.  I told the server in a polite way that we were standing there waiting for awhile, not only did he not apologize, he just said okay and walked us to a table. It seemed to me that the workers didn't really carry any customer service whatsoever. As we were eating, we also noticed the several parties that were coming in had to wait quite awhile to get someone's attention. Even though the food was really good, I will not be returning to this specific location due to the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Slightly overhyped, but still a good burger. But we had to wait a long time to get seated, and the host wasn't very good about appeasing his waiting customers. He also kept calling me by another name even after I corrected him a few times. I asked for my Miyagi-san burger to be cooked medium, but it was medium rare. Since we were in a hurry, I just ate it anyway, but too red for my liking. I liked the fried egg and furikake that came with it, and normally I love fried onions on my burger too, but for some reason, it felt like too much. I have to say though, the truffle oil fries were pretty delicious. And the sweet potato ones were not bad either. Our waitress was good, but not outstanding. I'm sure if I came back at a less busy time, it would have been more enjoyable, but 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"My friend and went, it was delicious  The service was quick and kept our drinks filled.  The burgers were cooled how we ask for. We tried the Parmesan fries. They were hot and well seasoned.   Overall  a good meal. The price for two burgers and one fry was 47 with tip. That was a little high. Retreats thought."}
{"text":"Came here during our New Year's Eve trip to Vegas.  Found it the same way all other out-of-towners find it -- because it was showcased on Triple D.  Burgers were great -- my girlfriend said it's the best she's ever had (although it's also the first time she'd ever tried wagyu beef).  I got the banh-mi burger, which has beef, pork and shrimp in it.  It was good; not amazing.  Couldn't taste the shrimp and that Asian pork flavor got old about halfway through, but no complaints about it otherwise.  The only downside was that service was slow.  We went there right when they opened and were the only ones there at first.  Our server was on-point until she got ONE more table, and then we never saw her (her tip reflected that fact).  On that basis, 3 stars instead of 4.  Still, on the basis of the food, would recommend visiting here if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"My overall experience at bachi burger was excellent! The food was delicious, high quality meats with fresh ingredients that didn't leave you feeling bloated. My wife and I enjoyed this place very much and appreciate how welcoming and hospitable the staff was. The organic ice coffee was superb! (Thanks Kevin) We highly recommend this place! We will definitely will come back when we're in town."}
{"text":"I have been in Vegas for a very long time and have never tried this place until today. Everyone tells me how amazing it is, so my boyfriend and I decided to go in and check it out. The menu was very different, but unique. We ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu burger and regular fries that came w/ pineapple ketchup. The ketchup was very good, we thought it tasted even better inside the burger. The burger was different yet unique like I said before, but it definitely was not worth what we had paid for. Our bill came out to be almost $40 with just the order of two burgers and fries & all we drank was water.. Probably won't ever go back to another Bachi Burger to spend that much on just two burgers."}
{"text":"My first Bachi burger was an eye opening experience! 
We are all used to great American hamburgers.  This one is a burger in a category of its own! 
They have other unique stuff but their classic burger is like no burger I ever had! 
Don't get me wrong, there's nothing like the classic old American burger.  But if you want a little change i strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Bachi's got burgers! I've enjoyed the burgers at a couple other valley locations and recently hit this one up a couple times for lunch over the summer. The design here is similar to the other locations, with a dark modern interior that still feels casual.

The menu features, you guessed it, a decision-impairing selection of Asian fusion burgers. The Kiki is my go-to, with a trio of onions, bacon, and gruyere with a sweet marmalade and spicy aioli. I had a minimal amount of mushrooms, which was disappointing considering they're the main reason I get this burger. It was served perfectly med-rare, though.

A friend chose the Bison Burger, with fig jam, onions, bacon, and bleu. This was a touch dry, not just because of the meat but it could have used a sauce. That said, the meat was so good that the leftovers were devoured in record time. A major plus to this burger is that it includes a side of fries, which you can upgrade to the truffle fries- do it, and ask for extra sun dried tomato sauce!

The service has been appropriately attentive but didn't rush us out when I lingered catching up with a friend. Prices are a bit high to make this a regular burger stop, but Bachi isn't putting out \"regular\" burgers anyway."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is owned by someone from Hawaii.  Anyway, ate here for dinner last night.  I ordered the Ronin Burger. Awesome! Only thing is I ordered it well done and it came medium well. :-/. Also shared some sweet potato fries with friends.  It was good!  Everyone liked what they ordered.  It is kind of expensive, but it does taste good.  Definitely check it out when you're in Vegas, or even if you live here!"}
{"text":"Best hamburger in town, they use quality meat, and the restaurant has a nice fusion flavor. Definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"The burgers here are great tasting and have great flavor combinations, but all of that is overshadowed by the ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS service.

When we first got there, there were only 3 tables that had been filled. So the place was still mostly empty. We walked up to the host/hostess station which was empty. When someone finally came over, he said that we needed to wait 5 minutes for the service to kitchen to catch up? This was well after the lunch hour and the kitchen did not look busy at all. So I asked if we could at least look at the menu and get an order ready, to which he replied no because we would still have to wait anyway. This made no sense at all since the kitchen was clearly NOT busy. When we were finally seated, the waitress took over 20 minutes to come greet us and when we got our order in, it took over 40 minutes for us to get our meal. Keep in mind that the restaurant is still very much empty at this point. When we got the bill at the end (which also took forever), we had been overcharged and then had to wait another half hour for the waitress to adjust it. So a meal that should have taken maybe just over an hour ended up taking over 2.5 hours due to their incompetence and general neglect. 

I'll probably try out their other location, but honestly the only thing saving this review for them is the fact that the food was actually good. It was just horribly tainted by their incomparably bad service."}
{"text":"My friend Andrew N. heard I was going to Vegas and asked if I've been to Bachi Burger. What burger, I asked? 
Bachi burger! 
Never heard of it, I said. 
Well, it's a fusion burger place off the Strip, and it's supposed to be pretty good.
Maybe I'll try it, I said, but thinking I probably won't because we might be too lazy to leave the Strip. 

But right after we checked in, my addicted-to-burgers bestie readily agreed to go even though she was sick and didn't have an appetite. Excited that she showed some interest in food, we passed on eating Earl's with our other friends and went to Bachi instead.

When we got there, we didn't have much of a wait since it was kind of late. The interior was pretty open-spaced, simple and clean. We were seated quickly, and my friend wasted no time in ordering her burger AND fries despite having the flu! We ended up with the miyagi-san's grass fed wagyu burger, black and green burger, and truffle parmesan fries.

Behold the burgers: miyagi sans (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=8YjaanPy1nCGW0crojJDkw#8YjaanPy1nCGW0crojJDkw) and black and green (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=8YjaanPy1nCGW0crojJDkw#FKU28v4IVPeZhS-fTYmpnw).

Wasn't sure how I was supposed to eat the miyagi-sans burger because it was stacked pretty high, but it sure was tasty. Grass-fed wagyu with fried egg, chili mayo, carmelized bacon, and onion crisps. The flavors were prominent, and the oozing egg yolk on top of a juicy patty was delicious.

The black and green burger was pretty good, but not as good in my opinion. It was slightly more bland with an earthly, sweet taste. 

The fries were drizzled with black truffle porcini cream that was pretty good. Not amazing though. It also came with a sun-dried tomato aoili, which was unnecessary because it didn't pair well with the fries. 

It was a good meal overall though. If you're looking to get off the Strip for a while, I would say give Bachi Burger a try if you like fusion burgers!"}
{"text":"I guess you would call these Asian-inspired burgers. I enjoyed my burger very much. I don't recall the one I ordered, but the waiter said it was the most re-ordered one on the menu. The fries were excellent. Had an order of the Bachi pickle appetizer, but it wasn't my thing. If you have the taste for it, you'll probably love it. Friendly staff. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My husband will be the first to admit that he is not a foodie. He doesn't get as enthusiastic about planning, cooking, or eating meals as I do. For him to say that the burger we shared here was the best he's ever had is a testament to this place. Outstanding burger, appetizers, even the condiments were phenomenal. And their beer list is GREAT! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place after trying this place over the weekend. I was debating in my head if this place should be a 4 or a 5. It's prob a 4.5 but I give it to you bachi burger...you get the 5! 

I think this place has got it all and it's definitely damn unique. That oxtail chili cheese fries were seriously out of this world hearty goodness. You topped that off with that beautiful sunny side up egg was simply perfection. I can't even find a flaw in this dish because it has everything I love in the dish. Just enough jalopeno to have a little kick to the fries and those beautiful cilantro to further enhance the flavor. The oxtail were seasoned well and it was almost melt in your mouth. If you really want to complain about it, it is simply because it is one of those dishes that will give you an instant heart attack. I totally recommend sharing it between 2-3 people and then ordering a burger. 

I also got the Miyagi-San burger which totally reminds me of Karate Kid. ANYWAY...I was reading the descriptions and it had Onions rings and kobe beef patty and i was like bring it on baby. I totally recommend patting it a bit before you take a bite so it will stay together when you eat. When I took my first bite, I simply went OOOOOOO. That patty was simply juicy as hell and those onions rings were the real eye opener. They weren't your typical onion rings because they fried those onion rings with tempura battered which made it extremely delicious. I totally recommend it!

IF I WAS GONNA CHOOSE BETWEEN THE BURGER OR THE FRIES, I SAY IT BE A TOUGH CHOICE BUT GO WITH THE FREAKING FRIES. WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GONNA GET OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES THAT SENDS PEOPLE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN WORLD. 

Vegas must bound place."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas this weekend. My brother seen this place featured on dives, diners and drive-in's. So we decided to try this place on our way in..... GLAD WE DID!!! The BEST burger we've ever had!! We also had fries, and onion rings.. VERY TASTY!! I'm super happy there will be a LA location opening soon!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. A little hard to find in 5 he shopping center. Our server was nice and checked on us every time he passed by. We mainly came for the Oxtail Fries. They didn't disappoint! I wish there was more oxtail though. The burgers were stacked high, which is always appealing. The burgers don't come with fries or chips which I find a bit weird. I recommend Kiki's Burger! It's was good, cooked to my specifications, and the cheese was just great. I have a soft spot for fancy cheese. Overall, it was a good experience. I'll definitely go back or check out their other location as well."}
{"text":"We ate here a few years ago when they first opened, before it was featured on Diners Dives and Drive-ins. So we were glad to see they made it on tv:)) We purposely went so that we could order the Vietnamese style steam buns with duck and pork folded inside like a little taco. But once we got there and started seeing everyone else's burgers coming to their tables, we were like, forget it, we're ordering hamburgers!! They're beautiful and delicious! The buns are different than most. I don't have any photos to share but just look at the gallery!! We had fried eggs on ours:)) Umm...Cloud 9! And we also ordered the truffle fries. Wow. What a great thing?! We were instant fans. Nice modern place. Not a fast food joint as there is a wait staff. I think they opened a second location? We haven't been back in a while, but will definitely make it a purpose again!!"}
{"text":"1. Server ordered wrong cheese for burger
2. Fly buzzing around us entire meal
3. Soup and burger did not arrive at the same time
3. Long wait for food.  Restaurant wasn't busy
4. Soup comes but it is wrong soup
5. Waiter/Manager tells me (with attitude) they come out of different kitchens so hamburger takes longer (ever heard of sychronized expediting?)
6. Finally got hamburger but fries still missing (another kitchen?)
7. Waiter finally brings fries when I say fries are missing. 
8. Fries are cold and hard 
9. The fly is still buzzing around bothering patrons when we left

For a $20 burger, we were disappointed in the food, service and snappy attitude of the fake eyelash server. 

Probably wont go back. There are too many other great restaurants out there"}
{"text":"Simply said, best burger in town, if not most towns.

Sure, you have a wide assortment of different toppings you can choose from, and a bunch of different fries to pick from, which will make the adventurous among us very excited, but at the core, the marinated Wagyu patties are the best burger patty around.

If that wasn't enough, great opening plates (try the bao, their steamed pork and duck buns) and some great desserts (the Portuguese donuts) to make it close to the perfect meal.

If I could take away half a star I would.  The service is sometimes inattentive or 100% best service possible, but that is true of most places."}
{"text":"so update, I was actually planning on going to the Summerlin location, but due to timing, my friend and I went to windmill again, that's because they close at 2am. Had the Ronin burger. Wow. that citrus aioli, is out of this world, japanese coleslaw was what made this burger in my opinion. My friend decided on the \"no-meat-here\" burger. I was kind of hesistant on trying it. Eggplant, tofu, red bean and a shitake mushroom patty. Ehhh. but it was surprisingly good, those ingredients went well together, I would have never ordered it for myself, but I am glad I tried it."}
{"text":"I heard the customer service was bad at this location and so was the wait for the food.

Both were false, on a sunday afternoon as I came here with one of my favorite people, looking to devour one of my favorite burgers. 

I had Mr. Ho's burger, we shared the truffle parmesean fries and \"she\" had the Black n Green burger. really we just shared everything. Mr. Ho's was served on a taro bun, as in the root! very good bun, with lup cheong sausage, which is a Chinese dried cured sausage,  great on stir fry noodles btw. I have to say the black n green burger edged out mr. Ho's. american wagyu grass fed beef, with point reyes blue cheese, and bacon, salty, stinky, and juicy. What more can you ask for? the truffle parmesean fries was just as good as i remember them, when i went to the Windmill location. Great experience all around"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.. great service & food, even my meat & potatoes hubby was thrilled.

We had the sauteed edamame, very good, but the fire from the chilis was starting to get overwhelming when the food arrived - great timing.

I had the special, a Loch Duarte Salmon sandwich and Just Fries.  First, the fries.. sheer perfection, and the pineapple ketchup was surprisingly delicious and perfect for such a hot day.  The salmon sandwich was nicely balanced, with the bacon being beautifully caramelized and giving a nice smoky crunch that kept the salmon from being overpowering.  I was expecting good, I got great instead.  

I was stuffed when I left, and I had half a sandwich and over half the fries left.. made me want to cry to leave it behind, but couldn't squeeze in another bite and didn't want to deal with leftovers.

Hubby ordered the Ronin Burger and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries.  First his fries.. he couldn't leave them alone.  As for the burger, he had ordered it medium and it arrived well done, but that didn't stop him from eating every single bite and practically moaning with ecstasy with each bite.  He didn't even care that there was no ketchup or mustard on his burger, he just knew he was in heaven.

We'll definitely be back.. and soon :D"}
{"text":"Right portion. Delicious. Great place for friends and family. Not too noisy and has good vibes. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Great Burgers. They've got a lot of good items on their menu. Whenever I'm in Vegas I always stop here. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"This really could be a 5 star burger joint and I wish there was something like this in the 'hood I live in, \"Tarzana in the house!\"

But it broke a major commandment for burger joints \"Thou Shall Not Cook A Burger Past Medium\". We ordered our burgers Medium but got them almost well, so sad. 

Guess what... that shows how good the quality and flavors are! We overcame and you shall too.

The truffle Parmesan fries are really amazing.

LA Peeps, Hit this up on the way back or on the way to your Vegas (Mis)Adventures, its only 5 min. off the 15.

{"text":"I love a good burger. We started out having Oxtail fries. Which were fries with melted cheese and a sweet chili on them. They were exceptional and a serving was enough for 4 skinny people. 
I had a bacon and Blue Cheese burger. I asked for it no bun but everyone else's by looked amazing and were soft to the touch and had a glossy type of glaze on them that just screamed eat me. The Bacon was caramelized and was literally unbelievably amazing. I asked for my burger cooked as rare as they could give it to me. And it came as I ordered but not so rare that it was a mockery. My burger came nicely presented in a bed of lettuce and had sautéed mushrooms galore. I asked for a chili mayo off of one of the other burgers that staff was more then willing to provide. 4 adults had an appetizer, 4 burgers, and 6 drinks and bill was $94. I was pleased. My wife and I can honestly say it was the best burger we have ever had. It is an Asian Infused restaurant. Spicy but not over the top."}
{"text":"What a unique take on burgers!! Asian fusion burgers!  When i came here I got the ronin burger and garlic chili edamame with sweet potatoe fries.  Everything was absolutely delicious. Definitely going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"Asian Fusion Burgers...sounds interesting.  So my last day in vegas  I thought I would check this spot out since it was very close to the Cancun where my friends were staying at.  We decided to call in our order a head of time since it was a pretty large order to go.  We decided to order the Ronin, Kiki, Kalbi, and Banh Mi. Im a big fan of peking duck so we also ordered the steamed sandwiches in beef short rib and pork belly.  Hahaha the order keeps goin we also ordered the sweet potato fries parm truffle fries, and porteguese donuts.

Burgers: All burgers were cooked medium $ 9.00 each
Ronin-  Im not a big fan of coleslaw  so this wasnt my favorite
Banh Mi- With the all the fixings(jalapeno, cilantro, and special sauce) I actually was surprisingly good...it worries me when they call it banh mi and its not actually viet banh mi...but a good twist to their version.
Kiki- I like all the mushrooms on this burger and the aioli i think is what made it good.
Kalbi- This one my friend like and she isnt found of spicy.  

Its the sauces and special dressings on the burger that really make them work.

Steamed Sandwiches: 3 pieces each
Peking duck - love peking duck.. Their version comes with eggs which was different for me. $ 12.50
Beef Short rib- my friend john really liked this version. The meat was very tender. $ 14.00
Pork Belly- This one I really like the best.. Marinate pork belly that is grilled.....hmmm pork!!! $ 12.00

Fries: $ 4.00 each
Sweet Potato fries- I have had better they were a bit dry.
Parm Truffle fries- interesting and different. For 4 bucks each I was expecting a bigger serving or fries.  My friends asked what is the brown sauce stuff on it...hahah I guess the truffle oil sauce!

Portugese donuts: $5.00 for 4 pieces w/ vanilla ice cream
they were basicly cake donut holes rolled in cinnamon and sugar. I never tried them before but my friend loves portugese donuts. He actually like them a lot...to me they were a lil dense but I assume they are supposed to be like that.

Service:
The guy at the registar and who helped me with my order was very nice.  He even asked me where the party is at since i ordered a lot of food. I laughed to myself and told him um no where we are just having dinner at the Cacun resort.  \"Oh can I come too!\" LOL! He was a reallly nice guy and he helped me carry out my order to my car.  He even offered me water or soda while I was waiting for my order to be ready.  Nice change from the strip where all the wait staff are very superficial and too good to be working where they are working at.  

The restaurant itself was nice.  I thought I was at the wrong place cuz it is actually set up very nice not like no regular fast food chain. Its an actually set down place.  

Would I go back to eat here again when I visit vegas..most likely.  I really like the Pork belly steamed sandwich a lot.  But they are a bit pricey. For peking duck 14 bucks for 3 pieces is alot...i can order a freaking whole duck for that and the steam buns."}
{"text":"If you want a perfect burger go to BACHI BURGER! The meat, the bun, the fries, the sauces OH EM GEE! Make sure to order the oxtail fries! They are a party on a plate! Service is great and food is phenomenal! My favorite is the spicy miso burger add avocado! So bomb!"}
{"text":"Several friends told me to go here, so while I was in Vegas last week several of us hit this place up.  As we pulled-up, we could see the line that was already waiting which was a good sign.  As we waited, we surveyed the menu so we could speed-up our ordering process.  We agreed to order several burgers so we could cut them up and share them with each other.  Started-off and ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and Oxtail Chili Fries which were awesome.  We ordered the Ronin, Miyagi-San, Spicy Miso, Kalbi and Black and Green burgers.  Needless to say they were all very good.  A bit pricey, but not like I'm going to order these every week.  A definite must try if you're in the area.  Service was also very good."}
{"text":"Happened upon the location thanks to some great Yelp reviews.  My girlfriends & I split up a bunch of burgers to taste test.  A couple were too sweet, but the special topped with a quail egg was awesome.  We all agreed.  The fry variations were good.  All very flavorful with fun variety.  We will likely be back for our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Yuck. Salty low grade beef with under cooked bacon wet bun and terrible onion rings. 
The place smelt like the sewer backed up and the waitress had 3 tables and took way longer than she should have. 
Never again."}
{"text":"My ex told me about this place right before I left  and said I have to try it for him lol! It was on the food network and it's off the strip so no one really wanted to take a cab just to eat a burger with me. Luckily on my last day here I found someone who was willing to try it with me. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. We shared the oxtail chili fries and split the Ronin and Banh Mi Burger. Both of them were delicious! I liked how mine came with fish sauce and the patty had beef, pork, shrimp mixed in the patty. Definitely worth the trip so make sure you come here and try it!"}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible, but I was in Vegas and NOT in the mood for another buffet.  I wanted something... different!  Bachi Burger caught my eye the minute I read \"Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries\" and the fries did not disappoint.  We got the fries first and before our burgers even came out, the plate was half gone, which probably explains why I couldn't finish my burger.  The Husband opted for their famous Ronin burger while I got the Spicy Miso Burger. Comparing the two, we both favored the Spicy Miso a tad more.  The burgers were good, but took a little getting used to... for some reason asian fusion burgers tend to be on the sweet side, definitely reminded me of MOS burger in Taiwan or Bun Bun.  Would we come back?  Probably, there's still plenty of other burgers and sides to try... oh and let's not forget the fries!"}
{"text":"We came here to fufill our quest to try DDD joints wherever we travel.  We tried the steam buns and the oxtail fries for appetizer just like in the show.  That came out quick and delicious.  We ordered burgers and Ramen.  The miso Ramen was quick to come out and my son loved it.  The aroma was impressive. The burgers took another 15 minutes to come out.  We all like to eat together. So we told him to go ahead and eat.  The Burgers were good but I don't think 5 star worthy.  Anyway, it was a good night out.  We enjoyed this place.  Not sure if we would do it again."}
{"text":"This is a must do everytime we visit Vegas and usually we are extremely satisfied with the food and service...except for today. Ordered my drink a few minutes before happy hour ended.  Waited a little while before it came to us, which was fine. Ordered salt and pepper garlic fries, the miyagi San burger, and some ramen. Burger came cooked to perfection. Absolutely delicious. Ramen came a little while after, perfect as well. We had to flag down our server because we were waiting for the fries and we needed a refill on our water. He forgot to put it in. So he got it in and waited about 15 mins for it. It was really bad. We usually order it and haven't had issues before but there was just so much ginger in it.  We tried to get at least halfway through but the ginger was so overpowering that we couldn't even get halfway!! So we get the bill and I wasn't charged the happy hour price for my drink. To our waiter's defense, he tried to fix it after I already paid, but I was so ready to leave. We usually have nothing but good things to say about this place and always refer friends and family here as a must have before they leave Vegas. Hopefully this is just an isolated incident because this is the first time we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Really accommodating, especially with a baby. They moved us around to another table when asked, just because of our baby. They redesigned their menu. Orange soda was not on the menu anymore, but they still made it for us. As always, burger was delicious and on point. Best burger ever!! I will miss this place when I leave."}
{"text":"I've been a bahn-mi burger junkie for some time, but the miyagi burger blew my mind! My wife always goes for the bachi fish, and it's delicious, but go miyagi!"}
{"text":"So we actually wanted to try Shoku which is the Ramen side of Bachi burger. When we got there we found out they are connected. They didn't seem too busy and they said it shouldn't be too long to get seated. We waited about 20 min. When we sat, server didn't come right away. She seemed nice but when asked \"what do you have to drink?\" She named a few then said \"I can't really think right now\". We ordered two bowls of their Ramen. Flavor profile was great but man! They were salty as hell! I've never been to a Ramen Noodle place so I'm not sure if that's normal but we pretty much didn't finish our bowls. my husband ordered a Bachi burger and it was very good so that gave them 3 stars. You can't go wrong with any of their burgers. Also c'mon $12 burger and fries don't come with it???? A little over priced. Sorry but we won't be regulars here."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple-D and had to check it out while in Vegas. Pretty damn good. The oxtail fries might be a little over rated, but are still pretty good, and there's a ton of them. I had the Banh Mi burger and loved it. The staff was excellent. Everyone was really attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. To start off, they have a great beer selection and plenty of sake. Check whatever seasonal beers they have. Nice appetizers, especially the oxtail chili cheese fries and the sausages. The pork belly steamed buns are like sliders so they're also a good appetizer for three.

Amazing burgers. You can get a standard burger on bun with lettuce and tomato if that's all you want, and I'm sure it'd be great. But this is a place to have fun pushing your culinary boundaries. The specialty burgers here are amazing so be adventurous! At least try the Black & Green Burger. I love the Ronin Burger and the Miyagi-san's Burger."}
{"text":"Service is atrocious.  Been here for an hour and we still haven't gotten our drinks.  How long will we have to wait for our burgers???"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Bachi Burger for the longest time - and I'm glad that I finally got to.

I think we'd arrived at the time of their usual dinner rush because there were six other couples waiting to be seated along with us. But, it didn't take too long before we were brought to our table and attended to. The server we had was very attentive, and was always there to get things to our table and reassured us throughout the night that our order would be out.

At first glance when looking at the menu, the boyfriend and I were honestly pretty suspicious about burgers in the $7-10 range, considering we're very stingy people who aim for what we feel is a fair price. All he could say was, \"This better be worth it.\" And that it was. That it was.

I've always heard that Bachi is great for the Asian fusion. That's why I've wanted to come here for a while. I love burgers, but something different for a change has been on my mind for a while. And they really did it right.

Boyfriend got the Peanut Butter Milkshake to start, and it was heavenly. Do try it if you're craving for something sweet, especially if you're willing to spend the extra $5. It's worth it. He also got the Banh Mi Burger, which he says had lemongrass, pickled veggies, shrimp, pate, pork, etc. There was also a sauce that came with it that he enjoyed.

We both shared Truffle Fries and I LOVED it. I was curious enough to try the Ronin Burger, which has onions, japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, katsu bbq, among other things I missed, plus some interesting sauce on the side. Personally, I liked it the way it was without it.

Overall reaction? Dinner was a-ma-zing. I'm giving it five stars for outstanding quality, plus the fact that the burgers were great and were at a pretty good size for $9.50 (Banh-Mi) and $10 (Ronin). I'm very much able to overlook the fact that the kitchen was backed up when we were there and that we spent about 20-30 minutes of our time waiting. Those are things I can hardly blame anyway. Plus, the burgers really lived it up for me, and I'm itching to come back soon. $30 total for both of us for was not bad at all.

Next time, I'd love to try the Kiki and the Kalbi. :) And, I'm not a spicy food person but plenty of my friends have raved over the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, so I'll suck it up one of these days and give it a shot. Apparently, it's to die for, and I'm curious enough to try it.

Oh man, now I'm hungry for some Bachi."}
{"text":"we went to the russell and rainbow location and it was pretty good. would definitely come back again to try other items. wish we could see menu prices on the items on yelp or website."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bahn Mi Burger, Kiki burger, Green and Blue burger, sweet potato fries & Parmesan truffle fries between 3 of us to split & all were excellent. Fries were crispy & done perfectly. I attempted to order the Bahn Mi burger medium rare which in most restaurants means medium. I has hesitant when the waitress said that the chef recommended it medium. I thought great I am going to get a dried out cardboard burger. But when it arrived it was so juicy, flavorful & was deep pink in the middle. We all cut our burgers into quarters so each of us could have a try of each one & I was so sad to have to let others try mine because it was soooo good. The other burgers were great as well but I loved the Bahn Mi Burger the most. It was my 1st time ever having one. I definitely will be going back to this place & rave about it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger in Las Vegas... or quite possibly in the US?

Most of my experience comes from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've tried dozens of places, if not hundreds, from cheap burger joints to upscale restaurants. Like Umami Burger, Roam Artisan Burgers, 4505 Meats, Mission Beach Cafe, SuperDuper, Chow, Marlowe, or even Spruce... Some of them were fantastic, but Bachi goes even further. My wife agrees.

I don't know what makes us addicted to their burgers, but I'm pretty sure they put some kind of cocaine in the ingredients. We need to blow a whistle to invite DEA to stop this madness. But before doing that, please allow me to have one last bite of the Miyagi-san burger... or the Kiki burger... or the Ronin burger... or the Just Fries... oh please help me!"}
{"text":"My friends are have their B'day party here on December 7th, I thought I would go try their Happy Hour menu. First no one was there at the front to greet me when I walked in, after few minutes I was seated. It took another 5 minutes before a waiter came by. I ordered the Furikake  Teriyaki steak-cut fries for $3. The fries was okay, I think they just fried the fries & put Mr. Yoshida's sauce with some sesame seed. Then I ordered the Crispy Calamari, I told the waiter, Bobby that it was okay. Bobby said he didn't believe me. I ordered Calamari every where I go, Fleming's is a great place to get Calamari, If you ever want to have good calamari, this place isn't it. The good news is that at least Bobby didn't call me a liar!! I must say that their Kiki's Burger is really good. Believe me, I want this restaurant to be successful. My parents owned a Chinese/Japanese restaurant for 18 years. It's so hard to please customers. I was not happy to be charged $8 for the Crispy Calamari. That's on their Happy Hour menu.  In this town their are many restaurants that offer better Happy Hour foods. I hope by December 7th, for my friends party, they will have better Happy Hour appetizers. I really hope this restaurant will have better service on December 7th. You will be impressed with their Kiki's Burger."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend who raved about it. To be fair, the food that I ordered (oxtail chili cheese fries and a Miyagi burger) was delicious.  But that's all that was good about this place.  Highly over-priced! The kids meal was $11 for the most bland mac & cheese and overcooked chicken.  My kids didn't eat it and I wouldn't either.  It was supposed to come with a mini sundae, which would've redeemed this place from the kids' standpoint...but they never got it. The waitresses were very sweet, but the service was horrible.  The kids meal came out long after the rest of the meal.  We had to ask for things about 3x each.  Drinks were not refilled.  Overall not a place I'd return to or recommend."}
{"text":"Burgers were melt in your mouth delicious!! I got the Ronin burger and bf ordered black & green. Of course I had a bite.. or 2 of my bf's burger.. What's his is mine right?? haha. Both were SOOOO good!!! Yum! Wish I had the stomach to eat every single burger in one sitting. Ox-trail chili cheese fries were too sweet for me so they were just okay. I'd just go back for the burgers."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, and found myself here when on a business trip. I shared the Kiki's burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries with a friend. It was big enough to get us both full.

I think it's a great place to stop by if you're looking for quality food. Everything was affordable, especially compared to things on the Strip."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to
This place but the food was mediocre for the price and the service is absolutely the worst. The server brings out water and there was a piece of gum in the wrapper in my water. So when I let the waitress know there was gum
In my water she just looked at me and rolled her eyes - no sorry no nothing. She then came back and I asked for chopsticks to find out there were none. 

The quality has really gone down a steep
Hill because they are so busy they are missing the whole reason why you'd open a restaurant.

We won't be back here at which too bad but oh well."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place. So when i came to visit a friend out in vegas i tild him that we should try it.  We go there @730 on sat and its not that busy, the hostess tells us @30 min wait could be sooner.  We are waiting for @45mins, watching about 15-20 people finish there meal and leave.  We try to find the hostess to ask whats up and she says the kitchen cant handle the orders and have asked that noone be seated at this time and that it would be @another 20-30 mins, and that even the people that are seated have been waiting over an hour for their food-unreal.  The place is very small, holds @40 people, and the tables were only @ 60%full and they could not handle that capacity??????   I could understand if they just opened, but they have been around for a while.   What sh!tty management.   Food might be great (would know cuz i didnt want to wait who know how long) but they need to find a person who knows how to manage the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners, Drive In & Dives.
The Mi-Yagi burger was to die for and the truffle fries were out of this world. A must go to place."}
{"text":"If the special is still offered. ORDER THE MOCO LOCO. This is a LV gem for sure. Definitely worth the drive of the strip."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my meal every time I come here and always leave stuffed!

Tonight we ordered the Ronin burger (..we enjoyed this from our last visit), spicy miso burger (..took a risk with this order and paid off!), and shared salt & pepper fries.

Not that we didn't like the ronin burger this time around, but we were extremely surprised & very much enjoyed the spicy miso burger much more!

We were expecting a wait tonight, as this was the case last time around, but we got seated right away. (Maybe cuz it's nascar weekend..?) Servers were friendly & attentive - always refilled our drinks before asking. 

We are looking forward to our next visit and ordering the spicy miso again & trying a new burger next time around :)"}
{"text":"First time trying this Bachi burger location. Came here for lunch with coworkers today (their first time ever at Bachi).

I ordered my usual Ronin burger. We all shared an order of fries. 

Is it me or did they increase their prices? I could've sworn last time I ordered a Ronin burger it was about $9.00. Knocked off one star because of this.

No complaints on the wait staff. And the restaurant itself is clean and roomy. 

I love Bachi so I will definitely come back. I just hope I don't see another price increase when I do =("}
{"text":"The burger with blue cheese was yummy but the garlic pepper fres were delicious"}
{"text":"Decided to try the Sahara location & was disappointed! The original location on Windmill is much better in my opinion. (I've been to the original location 8+ times.) Ordered my norm of the Banh Mi burger. I had asked for it Medium Rare & it showed up medium to medium well. Three others were dining with me that day & their burgers did not come out as ordered either. Fries were just ok. Between the 4 of us we ordered Oxtail Fries, Salt & Pepper & Truffle fries. Didn't seem as crispy as they should have & as they do @ Windmill location. Ambiance - place was too loud. We were there for a Tuesday lunch around 12:30pm. There wasn't that many people in the place but the walls just made all the sounds carry & even louder. They need some soft deco on the walls to help the noise. Overall I wouldn't go back to the Sahara location. I'd much rather go to the Windmill location."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas and decided to get some Ramen. Apparently, the Ramen restaurant next to Bachi Burger had merged into Bachi Burger. I wanted Ramen, but the menu was very limited (no non-pork base). So, I decided to try their burgers. Wow!  What a find! Best burger place! Cooked perfectly, fresh and delicious. Service was excellent. I definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Three words: Orgasmic food coma.

We came to Bachi Burger for our cheat meal...and boy, was it a cheat meal for the gods!

Our order: (I will upload a pic too)

-Sangria (just ok...no pieces of fruit in it, none)
-Banh mi burger
-Miyagi-san wagyu burger (requested carmelized onions to replace the carmelized bacon)
-Sweet potato fries (the dipping sauce is heaven, a little dill in there maybe?)
-House salad

I literally ate the entire Miyagi burger...the whole thing. The carmelized onions along with the fried onion rings inside the burger was just heaven. Sweet, salty, meaty, my tummy is rumbling just typing about it! What I also really liked was the bun. It wasn't overly thick and bready like other hamburger buns can be. It had good texture and consistency to it.

I'm usually a dessert kind of girl, especially with cheat meals...but I absolutely could not fathom eating dessert after downing the entire burger. All I wanted to do was curl up and take a nap :)

Until next time my sweet Miyagi-san (with carmelized onions instead of carmelized bacon) xo"}
{"text":"Food is great here but sadly the oxtail fries that everyone raves about sent me home with a rash all over my body! Giving 3 stars anyway because the kobe burger I also ordered was delish. I'd come back but sadly I fear another rash."}
{"text":"Amazingly amazing burger,  I honestly would have to put Bachi at the best burger in Vegas.  Creative menu, full of flavor, and the best part...CONSISTENT."}
{"text":"A buddy had seen Bachi featured on some Food Network tv show. Since I'm an easy sell and pretty much a sucker for advertising, that was endorsement enough for me to search out this place.

As soon as I saw the Shogun burger on the chalkboard outside, I knew I had to be an idiot and go for it. (I'm particularly susceptible to chalkboard marketing, I should add.)  The shogun is one of their specialty wagyu beef burgers with a layer of unagi, pan-seared foie gras (this is what sold me), thin slices of asian pear and miso butter spread. On the side they throw in a yamamomo peach. Not sure why but maybe it helps theoretically justify the $25 price tag.  

Before we get to the burgers, I gotta say that the milkshakes (all of them) were awesome. Creamy, thick and diabetes-inducing. I liked my strawberry-guava, but everyone else thought the peanut butter one was tops. 

The much-talked-about ox-tail fries were a surprise. The ox-tail \"stew\" covering the french fries is actually a little sweet and tasted great. I thought it would just be chili-cheese fries using ox-tail but it had a different flavor than I anticipated.  We had to stop ourselves from ordering seconds so we wouldn't ruin our appetites. 

Okay, main event. So I bought the biggest, baddest burger off the regular menu. Did I love it? Honestly for the price I found it okay. The beef they use for their burger tasted good, and when I bite into a burger I don't watch sauces or ketchup to take away from the lovely flavor of cow carcass. The unagi was my least favorite part because its flavor really overpowered everything else (except for sweetness of the pear) and made every bite just taste like unagi. So minus the unagi, I'm left with a good beef patty, pear and foie gras. It all tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend it for $25.

I also tried the Ronin burger which has a little sweetness too from a layer of coleslaw and I really enjoyed it overall. Next time I have to try the pork steamed buns and some of the other burgers as well. Maybe the Shogun didn't live up to my expectations, but I still had a great meal and will be back next time I'm in Vegas.

Oh, and that yamamomo peach? Popped it in my mouth (it's about the size of a marble) and looked back at everyone else watching for my reaction. I shrugged, \"Tastes like candy.\""}
{"text":"Came here due to recommendations from my cousins who raved about it being the best place for a burger in Vegas. So on my way back home we drove by this place to give it a try.  We got here right as it opened, so there was no line to deal with.

A friendly and enthusiastic staff member greeted us and sat us down. He asked if we had ever been to Bachi Burger and when we said no, he did a quick introduction of some of the more popular items on the menu.

There were three of us and we got the following:

Truffle Parmesan Fries: ($5.50) which included  Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side.  
 
- I thought it was decent. I didn't really taste the truffle flavor as much as I hoped for, and I preferred my fries to be a bit crispier.  I would probably pass on getting this the next time.

BBQ Bachi Burger: ($13.00)  8 oz Grass Fed Wagyu, lettuce, tomato and onion. 

- This is the burger to get if you want a simple, juicy and flavorful burger where you let the bun and the meat shine. My friend enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't see the need for extra toppings or sauces. 

Black & Green Burger: ($14:00) American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, sautéed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese,roasted garlic 

- No doubt this is a flavorful burger, just reading the ingredients makes you salivate.  My friend liked the burger and the combination of flavors. He said he would get it again.

Shogun burger:  ($26.00): Wagyu Beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo Peach palette cleanser.

- I got the ultimate flavorful and tasty burger I have ever tasted. Over indulgent, perhaps.  However, the flavors surprisingly work well together.

Granted I was in search of foie gras coming from California which has now banned the delectable item so it was a no brainer that I chose this burger when I saw it on the menu.

It is a very rich tasty burger and slightly oily, but that is a given. The foie gras was pan seared so it was soft and melted slightly over the beef so there was a lot of texture going on with the poached pear. 

Our waiter came to check on us after our food was delivered and told me that I should have the \"Yamamomo Peach\" before I eat the burger as it is a palette cleanser to prepare your tastebuds from all the flavors before you bit into the burger. Just remember that there is a small pit in the marinated peach.

I can see that the Shogun burger is not for everyone, but I enjoyed every bite of this burger.  The menu if fairly extensive and has a little bit of something for everyone. 

Our server mentioned they plan to open a Bachi Burger near UCLA soon and another place called Healthy Life Kitchen.

Why 4 out of 5 stars? Well, I was a bit disappointed with the truffle fries. 

Service was fine. Parking is plentiful. Prices are higher but I suppose you get what you pay for. 

I would definitely come here again if I was ever in Vegas.
  
p.s. I was tempted to get the oxtail chili fries, but my companions were less adventurous. Darn!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!  I love this place!  It was recommended by several friends, so I came here with my family, and it is possibly one of the best local burger joints in town.  Not to mention the homemade sodas.  Mmmmm!

We pigged out and order the kiki, fish, and kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries, truffle fries, Peking duck rolls, and finished off with Portuguese doughnuts.

The short review:
Get the fish burger, sweet potato fries, and a Cherry Yuzu soda.  The fish is rich and just as good as a beef burger.  The sweetness in the fries pair off really well with the bitterness of the Cherry Yuzu.

The longer review: 
The kalbi burger is really good, but also really sweet.  The first bites are tasty, but then my tongue got a little sick of the sweet meat.  Surprisingly, the kimchi on the burger wasn't overpowering.

The truffle fries are cooked just as well as the sweet potato fries: crispy yet fluffy.  The truffle gave it a richness that contrasted with the Parmesan shavings.  But, the truffle is only at the top, so everything under the first layer are regular fries.

I wasn't too big on the doughnuts only because I am not a fan of cinnamon, and the accompanying ice cream for the doughnuts were loaded with cinnamon flecks.  Loaded!  

The atmosphere is really hipster.  The servers are young and relaxed.  The decoration is modern with an Asian theme, but still reminds me of a local coffee shop in Seattle.    

Overall, the food focuses on contrasting flavors that complement which was done really well.  The quality is very high, and the atmosphere is awesome."}

{"text":"I wanna say first I'm a burger and beer kinda guy. I've been here twice so far and each location I've been to has had fantastic service. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Seriously!!! I've tried a lot of it
Try the Cherry Yuzo soda it'll keep you coming back for more. 
I truly love places like this. They've honestly put an amazing new twist on something so classic."}
{"text":"Wowzers.  I am so happy we tried this spot while in Vegas.  I initially had my heart set on the bao buns, but I just couldn't resist.  I had the The Banh Mi Burger.......and it is indescribable.  Flavorful, juicy, generous portion.  I couldn't stop taking bites.  I literally inhaled it.  I had the edamame with garlic with a touch of spice, it was a perfect pairing with my burger.  

It was a busy Tuesday night...yes on a Tuesday...that says something about this place.  However, we were seated and checked on so many times, I didn't notice how busy they were. They were super friendly and quick.  

I am going to be sad that a bachi burger crave is going to have to wait until I am back in the area.  I really hope they decide to come up to Northern Ca.  I highly recommend for everyone to try this place at least once.  You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was starving so I toke him to Bachi Burger and he ordered a hamburger medium well to go. He waits about 10mins and comes out with a to go bag and we hit the gas station then home. He opens the bag to find a sack of fries inside, no burger. Mind you fries don't come with their over priced burgers. So he calls them and requests a fresh burger to be cooked for him and we drove all the way back. Did they cook him a new burger? No! They tried to give him the same one that was now about 35 minutes old. So we waited again and refer to the pic to see that they gave him... the bun and the burger and that's it! No lettuce, tomato, no mayo, no nothing! Unfortunately they locked the door behind him because by this time it was 10pm so no way to get the rest of what he paid for. For sure going to contact the General Manager tomorrow for a refund because this experience was a complete joke! Not sure if we will ever trust them again."}
{"text":"Update: went back with the husband this time. Still such a great place. We pretty much ordered the same burgers I reviewed. This time I tried the oxtail chili fries app. AWESOME! Fried egg yet again. Their oxtail chili was really good. Wish they put more on. Definitely a place I hit up everytime I'm in town. :)"}
{"text":"Unique. Fantastic! Loved it!  We had a great lunch here after trying it for the first time.  It was around 2pm when we walked in and there was about a 10 minute wait.  I thought it would be an off time coming in but they were busy!  It must be a winner!

We decided to try a few different burgers and split them so we could taste a couple different things on the menu.  Our choices were the Kiki Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. 

~ the Kiki Burger had a fabulous blend of sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon and garlic chili aioli.  The flavorful bacon really stood out.  The buttery soft bun complimented this so perfect. The angus beef was absolutely cooked to perfection.  This burger is an A+!

~the Spicy Miso burger was also such a delectable, mouth watering treat for my taste buds!  The unique combination of pepper mayo, onion, cheese and apple vinaigrette sent my world spinning!  Not to mention that they inserted a fried egg in between all of the other yummy ingredients.  WOW!! 

On the side we went with the Truffle Parmesan and Sweet Potato Fries.  OH YEAH! They were crispy, full of flavor and served with a delicious dipping sauce.  This was great to change it up from the usual ketchup.   The truffle sauce gave the fries a different yet fabulous flavor with a hint of garlic taste.  Score!  The Sweet potato fries were just as delicious.  They were crispy and perfect with their chosen dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what this was but I was in heaven! 

I can't write this review without mentioning the phenomenal service they provided!  Our waitress was attentive, so friendly and courteous! She even asked us if we had any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of.  This was the first time anyone ever asked me this!  That's amazing to me!  Plus they had others walking around with water pitchers to refill our glasses even when they weren't even half gone!  All restaurants should do this! 

Why did I wait to long to try Bachi Burger? Now that I know how delicious their food is, I hope not to wait so long for my second visit.  If you want a different flare of a burger flavor...  this is definitely the place to go!   Can you tell I loved it?"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers! Service was quick and friendly. Must try the banh mi or the kiki both are super delicious! The boba drinks are alright but a little grainy. All and all it was delicious and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Good asian fusion burgers and other sides. I got the kalbi burger and shared the oxtail chili fries, truffle fries, and pork belly bao. All were good but highly recommend the baos. Food is pretty expensive but if you're willing to splurge for a unique burger it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This is one our favorite places to eat. The stir fry edamame with chili is always amazing. The Bachi fish is to die for. The fish is always cooked to perfection. The Miyagi-San burger is also a favorite. Not only is the food full of flavors the milk shakes are amazing as well. The serving sizes are generous. I usually have to finish my wife's fish burger. The fries are great too. if you love a mouthful of flavors then Bachi Burger is for you!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers but priced as much as a prime rib dinner at Lawerys.  Top burgers are $16 and fries $12.  Strawberry Lemon aide (which was very good) is $4.50.  Have a beer plus tip and you are looking at $38 person.  Its very good, and if you have the means, then this is a unique hamburger experience."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Bachi Burger. And now there's a location close to my work...this could spell trouble. I've tried other burgers but I always come back to the Bahn Mi. Waiter seemed stiff & not used to being a waiter. Maybe he was new? Asked for bill to be split but it wasn't when we received it. Hopefully they can get that correct in the future."}
{"text":"We are frequents to the Las Vegas and Henderson area. Every time my family and I are down, we think of the plethora of great eats in these cities. A couple of weeks ago we found out about bachi burger and their food has opened my eyes. In California, the closest burger to compare (which doesn't match up IMO) is umami burger. At bachi, I tried their miyagi burger, and each bite was full of flavor. The bun was toasted to perfection and for some reason, the juicy richness of the meat never left the buns soggy (twss). If you're ever in town for a 5-star burger that puts all other burgers to shame, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Fourth time here and I love it every time. Friendly service and great food. Excellent ramen and the loco moco risotto never disappoints. I get it every time."}
{"text":"I never visited the original location due to pure laziness but loved it when they opened one up by my favorite Indie movie theater.  This place is great for after a movie, lunch, dinner, or just to grab take out as I've done before.

What I really enjoyed here was the variety of types of burgers whether you enjoy beef, fish, turkey, or chicken.  I've only had \"The Lonely Bird\" and \"Bachi Fish\" but everyone I've eaten who's joined me here has enjoyed what they've ordered.  The key to making this place different is their delicious buns and variety of sauces both really add to the flavor experience.  I do recommend going with a few people and ordering sweet potato or garlic fries with a variety of sauces."}
{"text":"So time finally came when was in the area and me and the fiance were hungry. We sat there for awhile to de ide where to go...Mac house, kona grill, CPK, then it hit me! Its time to give bachi burger a try! We get there around 10pm and Its. Wasn't that busy being they close at 11pm. We were seated immediately and the hostess and servers were great! Very friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was clean and I liked the decor, pretty cool spot to hit up if you want a burger! So we ordered, we started with the butter truffle edamame and while it was good, it was oily and had lots of butter taste which was a nice change from the usual steamed veriety, but it didn't really have any truffle flavor. While we still enjoyed it, it would have made it a hit to have a stronger truffle flavor present. I orderedsalt and opera garlic fries with a side of pineapple ketchup (side of pineapple ketchup is $.50 extra) the fried were cooked well and were not greasy, the fresh jalapenos were a nice touch and added some kick, both the aioli and ketchup were perfect and the balance of those two being spicy and savory to sweet and salt was awesome and I will def get that combo of chili garlic aioli and pineapple ketchup again. I looked over the menu and while the burger to get with what I've gathered is the miyagi san, the ronin really appealed to me. So for this time I got the ronin. We didn't get the wagyu patties and stuck with the Angus and it was cooked to perfection! Med cooked with pink center was done to my liking! The flavors that stood out to me on this burger was the caramelized onions, Katsu sauce, and the miso gonna dressing. The bun was soft, chewy, and just a perfect way to round out this burger. The fried egg was a nice tough and everything worked in harmony. Nothing to over powering or lacking, the burger itself was seasoned well, juicy, and a very easy eating burger.  My overall first impression got better and better as I continued to eat the burger, the best burger in Vegas?? I don't know yet. I will have to try the miyagi San next time around but from what I've had this time, it is very close. I don't mind spending some decent money on a good burger and this was no expection. We will be back as the flavors of our first visit was the hook!"}
{"text":"Went for Lunch today, Sun, @ 1:30pm. Place was about 1/2 full and there were 3 wait staff working. This is the 2nd time I am here. The first time, I had the Ronin burger. OK, but a bit over the top for me with a bunch of stuff on it. In my past review, I gave it a 3 star. Today, I am going simple. BBQ Bachi Burger, medium, sweet potato fries, and chicken kara-age.

Like the last time, despite the fact that there were 3 wait staff, the service was somewhat slower than at many other restaurants. 3 times, I had to flag the wait staff down to ask for things. -1 star for slow service.

The Chicken Kara-age came first, average portion for $6. The visual was not what I expected, the kara-age very dark in color and not the golden brown I'm used to seeing, so immediately, I was a bit skeptical. However, it turned out to be pretty good. The color is dark because they seem to marinade the chicken some type of Teriyaki type sauce which is giving it not only the dark color, but a sweet, salty taste as you bite in. It comes with some sort of chili mayo dip which has some kick to it. Not Bad.

The sweet potato fries and the burger came together. The swee potato fries is one of the best I have had so far. Very tasty. It is sprinkled with what they say is a Kaffir Lime Hawaiian Salt (OK, I never would have known if it was not on the menu) and ground peppers. The sweetness of the potato, the salt, and the pepper gives a nice balance of taste. The yuzu citrus aioli gives you an option of adding a bit of citrus taste to the combo.

The BBQ Bachi burger was awesome. Done perfectly to medium, with tons of juices flowing. The slight sweetness of the bun goes well with the BBQ burger. By the way BBQ is not the tangy type of BBQ sauce, but rather more the soy type like a Teriyaki BBQ. I prefer this burger over the Ronin that they have.

4 stars this time around for what I had. I wish they would improve on their service."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this Bachi Burger location. I usually go to the Windmill location, but I just recently discovered that this somewhat new location is five minutes away from my house. First impression: I walked in and it seemed like chaos. The hostess seemed overwhelmed with the amount of people waiting to be seated although there were probably only 3-4 parties ahead of me. Then, I proceeded to tell him I wanted to order to-go. He then politely asked me to sit at the bar & he would be with me momentarily. However, he must've forgotten about me because I found myself sitting there for over 15 minutes. Luckily the person behind the bar asked me if I needed anything. She took my order for me. I ordered a Kiki burger and salt and pepper fries. -- Also as a side note, I tried to call in advance to order my food, but no one answered the phone! I called twice. Before I even get my food, I'm already annoyed with their service. As I'm waiting for my food, I'm observing others. By the looks of it, some look annoyed too. Just want my food!!"}
{"text":"Far and away the worse service I've ever had. I went with my sister on a lunch break. An hour and a half later, no food. This wouldn't normally be the worse thing in the world but after I left and went back to work without eating my wife informed me that they forced my sister to pay for the burger I wasn't there I eat. Apparently it showed up just shy of two hours later. I couldn't believe the gall."}
{"text":"Came here and the first thing the waiter tells us is about all the missing items from the menu! I do not understand how a place in that size and reviews not managing to control inventory, i do not eat meat and the one veggie option was out so i stayed hungry and watched all my friends eat but me!
When you only have 1 veggie option you need to make sure it is available!!!!
I am so dissatisfied with this place 
Giving them 3 starts is only for not running their business correctly.
Now i will go eat some Thai food."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed by Bachi Burger. 

My girlfriend wanted to come here for her birthday so we came on a Saturday at about 6pm or so, we waited roughly 20min but we got seated relatively prompt seeing as we had a group of 7. 

We ordered drinks and ordered food, we got the oxtail chili cheese fries first and man that was good. Really good flavor, the fries were good and the chili was extremely flavorful. 

Next the burgers! 

I had the Ronin Burger, the meat was cooked a perfect medium rare, caramelized onions, a Japanese slaw and an aoli.

Overall really impressed with this place and the rest of our group was as well. Very accommodating (minus the forced gratuity added) to our group."}
{"text":"This place is tied for first with my other favorite, Burger Bar at Mandalay Place.  It's one or two notches above a place like Smashburger, LBS at the Red Rock, Island's, and the old Create (now a Five Guys).

I had a Kiki's burger, my wife had a Spicy Miso burger.  Both were delicious.  I'll give the edge to hers, as it had a fried egg on top. 

There was nothing to comment about regarding service, meaning it was fine.  We'll be going back whenever our waistlines and blood lipid levels permit."}
{"text":"Try my trio pick... Miyagi San Burger, Pork Belly Bao and The Oxtail Chili Fries. Bomb! Great Food and Great Service. Love it!!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"This review is about the service & not the food...
Had dinner with my two friends & my 10 month old daughter last night. We were seated promptly & waters were given right away. I thought \"how nice, they brought my daughter a plastic cup with straw for water!\".  My third friend came a few minutes later. I didn't notice until our server mentioned it, but there were only 2 menus. I had told her there were 3 adults & the baby. Ok, no biggie. My guy friend had never been there before. He asked our server what kind of cheese is gruyere? She states \"white cheese\". Awkward silence. I explained to him it's more of a pungent cheese with a sharp flavor. So, the fries came out before the burgers which was great because we were starving. The burgers came out quickly as well. The food is usually really yummy & it was last night too!
So, the aforementioned plastic cup for my daughter was a big hit with her. All she wanted to do was drink from this cup. Well, my daughter dropped the cup and water went everywhere on the floor. Thankfully, there wasn't anyone next to us on either side. The server came by to check on us & I asked her if she had any rags for me to clean up the water. She came by with a few napkins & then saw the mess. She tried to to sop the water up with the few napkins, then realized a mop would be better. Well the mop never came. Mind you when the water dropped, another server was walking by & saw the whole thing. He ignored us. Our server came by twice to tell us \"we will clean when you leave, you probably don't wanna exit over here since it's wet\". Ok thanks for pointing that out. So, the plates were not even cleared for dinner when out came our check. I gotta tell you, my last review I raved about the dessert I had! I may have even dreamed about it for a week! I wasn't planning on having any last night but to not even be asked was a major insult. Sorry, my daughter spilled the water. Sh*t happens. My friend asked while we were leaving, \"how come our server asked that other table if they wanted dessert?\". That was the last blow. I ended up tipping 22% since we had the water mess. I should have written a note \"if it wasn't for my daughter spilling the water, you wouldn't even have received 15%.\" Looking back, I shouldn't have left the 22%. Will I be back? Probably. But not for a while. The food is good but when you receive bad service, the food can't always save it."}

{"text":"Generally, I'm not a fan of the gourmet burger.  I think they're overpriced and the flavors mixed and muddied with too many ingredients, especially the burger itself.  Give me a good In-N-Out instead.  Bachi finally met the challenge of a worthy gourmet burger.  I had grave doubts as I shoved the enormous burger into my mouth, but the burger won me over.

We indulged, ordering three different types of fries (the pineapple ketchup the nicest surprise).  We got milk shakes (excellent).  Edamame were wonderful -- both flavors, though a bit oily.  The burgers excellent.  Good service.  Nice interior.  A nice happy hour.  We'll be back.

There's a reason why this is rated as the best burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for ages, waiting for the day I finally get to Vegas! Finally finally I got the opportunity last week! We took a cab from the strip which was maybe a 20 minute cab ride. When we arrived there was people lined outside the door but only a 25 minute wait. The restaurant is small and not set up for waiting, we had to stand against the wall or wait outside. Wall please, it's 110 outside! To speed up the process we agreed to a seat at the bar. The bar has a wall up so you have to order with the waitress behind you, during this busy time I was not impressed by this set up. 

I already knew what I wanted to order but hubby kept changing his mind. Even after getting advice from our bar neighbor lol and taking pictures of his burger, Hubby decided on the Kiki burger?! Ugh I really wished he got another one but his choice right?! Kiki Burger, Oxtail Fries, and Duck Buns, let's do this!

Kiki Burger: Kobe patty, onion jam, mushrooms, cheese and an added egg. Very disappointing! The onion jam was overpowering and super duper sweet! It completely ruined the burger. I can say the burger was cooked to perfection but the jam made it inedible. Hubby ate half.

Oxtail Fries: This was my favorite dish out of the three! The meat was shredded and tender! Loved the egg but wish it was bit less cooked. This dish saved this review.

Duck Buns: I should have ordered the pork belly buns! The duck was plain and bland. The sauce was sweet....I took jalapeños from fries and added it to the buns. Boo!

Service was great! Young gal was sweet and excited to serve.

If I ever get the opportunity to go again, I would. Overall glad I tried, next time we are picking other options."}
{"text":"Have been to two of the locations. The Sahara location three times and the Windmill location for the first time last week. Every time the food has been great. If you like chili cheese fries prepare to be amazed. Their version is the Gold Standard of chili cheese fries. Have had a variety of their burgers and all have been very good. Had the sweet chili wings at the Windmill location which were great too. This is my go to burger spot!!"}
{"text":"This is a place that I love to take tourist since it is a Vegas thing.  I love to watch other people eat things that make them stop talking so they can enjoy their food.  Bachi Burger does this over and over.  The Bahn Mi is incredible, along with the pickles and the oxtail chili cheese fries and really any of the other burgers.  The shakes are ridiculous but filling.  The one thing that I can say about eating here is when I leave I am always satisfied,"}
{"text":"I could barely fit it all in my mouth but I tried real hard. Excellent ingredients and the service is decent. It took a little longer than I would have liked but that's cause they want to position themselves as a restaurant not a burger joint - somewhat of an identity crisis."}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog this place is on point when it comes to a saucy burger. The flavorful juicy burgers will take you to funky town and back. The service can be a bit slow, especially when it comes to seating you but it's certainly worth the wait. The ramen is worth passing on... I mean, who needs ramen when you have a burger that tastes like it fell off of Aphrodite's plate!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, we finally made it.  Yea!  Arrived just after 8 PM on a Friday, and there were groups of people waiting both outside & inside.  The wait was worth it!  I had the pork belly on a steamed bun and ho-ly crap it was good!  Pork belly had great texture and rich flavors that were complimented by the warm, sweet steamed bun.  Our group shared an appetizer of the chili oxtail fries - huge order definitely for sharing.  My brother-in-law loved the Bachi fish!

Couple of bummers:  problem with the air conditioning - it was quite warm and uncomfortable - and when my wine was presented it was warm.  Others in my group ordered beer, and although it was cold it wasn't as cold as it should've been.  When I requested the wine be taken back and removed from the bill (I only had one small sip), I was told it wasn't possible to remove something from the bill once it's been added.  Huh?  Our waitress, Christy, was attentive and pleasant and offered a free ice tea while the wine was chilling in the refrigerator.  I appreciated the attempt to rectify, but am not pleased with the policy.

In the end, this was not a deal breaker and the quality of the food is great!  Hopefully the issue with the air conditioning will be fixed soon, and the beverages will be served at proper temp.  If that happens...  definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!

After hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.

Upon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...haha

Most of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.

I think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:

I got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...

KIKI'S BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ

My BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!

MIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtg

We also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.

SWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQ

PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUg

Service was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...

Bottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!"}
{"text":"While seated, the song ordinary girl by rebolution was playing in the background, a sweet island melody that put me in such a good mood. Our maitre d' Alina is most pleasant and entertaining to our needs. She is well educated on the full menu and provided insights on what to order. 

On the table:

Plantation iced tea!!!! Home brewed tea infused with mint mixed with pineapple juice. It was the right amount of sweet and mint flavor tea! Thanks for handmaking our drinks Alina...best service ever!

Spicy miso on wagyu patty. 

First time biting into a wagyu patty and I must say there is a marked difference. 

Food for thought: the meaning of wagyu translates to japanese cow. The patty originates from any of four Japanese breeds of beef cattle. The cattle undergo a process called marbeling in where they are fed a high energy diet which contains corn and barley thereby producing a marble pattern carcus yielding intramuscular fat that provides a good amount of fat to lean ratio. 

The result...the meat tasted juicy and lean. Every bite had a filling sensation and a creamy texture. The spicy miso sauce is spicy indeed. The sweet bread balanced the spice and the egg gave the burger that wet texture to mix in with the balance of sweet and spicy flavor. The size was a good bread:patty ratio both more than a mouth full. I would have licked my plate clean but my mouth was on fire. The burger holds true to its given name: \"Spicy\". 

Pair this entree with oxtail fries which is a blend of beans, jalapenos, oxtail meat, bacon, and a cocktail of spices. 

The overall meal gave me a belly boner! Hats off to the chef! It would be a crime to not join the culinary experience that only Bachi burgers can deliver."}
{"text":"Oxtail fries. Just shut up and order them. Don't question it, just get them. Your meal and your overall quality of life will be better once you eat them.

Anyway, I love this place. It's right down the street from my house and definitely holds a special place in all of our hearts. 

My first time going there I got the Ronin burger, which I definitely recommend. It's delicious. It's salty, sweet, crunchy, soft, juicy, tangy, refreshing, gooey, and messy. It's everything you want in a burger. 

Seriously, Bachi burger is great. It's got a cool vibe inside, they have a good beer selection and a great menu of delicious, un-pretentious food. 

Just go there."}
{"text":"Burgers are 4 stars, definitely solid (not outstanding, but solid), but their ramen was garbage, 2 stars.

Burgers were well prepared, and the flavor combinations were interesting and tasty. Plus their truffle fries were delicious. 

Their ramen sucks. They got the appearance right, but their broth was just awful, and the pork belly was reminiscent of dried bacon. I actually ended sending back a tonkotsu black garlic (which I rarely do), and requested the more forgiving spicy miso...which also disappointed.

Manager was nice, other servers were somewhat subpar."}
{"text":"The 3 stars was for the food. Other than that service was rather aweful. We did not feel welcome at all! Server Nancy was a real defensive one too. She spoke too fast as if she was rushing us out and getting annoyed when we ask her questions. She had no sense of humor what so ever!  I will come back.... maybe."}
{"text":"Chili cheese fries flames wagyu burger flames
I ordered the most bland burger n it was still fire

Need I say more ? Lol
Only thing was that my Uber was late n arrived a little cold but it was still a little cold but fire regardless"}
{"text":"Excellent choice, we had several burgers and ramen for 9 ppls. Also must try the bacon fried rice, was so good. Will come back here but avoid the long wait and come before 11:30 or peak hours."}
{"text":"I finally returned and I am glad that I did. The off putting smell of eggs upon entering is no longer there. The service was extremely attentive and efficient. We were seated immediately and our drinks came out quickly. The server was pleasant and professional. I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger and we shared the oxtail chili cheese fries appetizer. We cleaned our plates! The burger was so much better than I remember, and it appears that some positive changes were implemented since my last visit over six months ago. Another great local business to add back to my list of neighborhood favorites!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  Bursting with flavor and texture. The staff was prompt and very helpful. The restaurant was very clean and we'll organized. The spicy edemame were mouth watering delicious. Lots of Chile oil. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I'm with those reviews that describe this place as pricey, where the product doesn't live up to the hype. We had the oxtail fries, which are plentiful, but essentially mild chile on just-okay fries. The Kiki's burger was good, and then I had one with onion rings whose name I can't remember, but it was pretty dry without much sauce or flavor. The burgers were nice, but modest in size. The draft beer selection was very limited (four?), and I spent, for me and my son, with tip, $60!! yikes"}
{"text":"Ronin burger and Parmesan truffle fries.  Freakin ridiculously good. Quality of food and fusion of Asian to burgers is unique and executed perfectly. Great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Khalbi you're the best!! It's a kimchi burger- I thought it would taste funny- kimchi on a burger but I gave it a try- and hola! This is now my fav here! Kiki's good too! And their garlic fries and their.. Oh well! Everything's good! Fine. Period."}
{"text":"Two things are guaranteed in life when entering Bachi Burger 1) Ordering Oxtail Fries 2) Ordering an amazing burger. My friend recently moved down to Vegas and started creating all these foodie spots that she really liked. When I came down to visit her, bachi burger was the first place we ate at. I went during lunch hour so there was no wait for us. It was a party of three. I looked at the menu and my friend right away ordered the oxtail fries while we were looking at the whole menu. Oxtail fries are a MUST. The hype is real and you'll see as you try it out yourself. The egg on top of the fries was perfection alongside the oxtail. Amazing combination. For my burger, I got the miyagi-San burger which is the BEST burger I've ever tasted in my life. I've eaten at a lot of burger spots and nothing beats this. It was Cooked to perfection and there was so much flavor to it. I savored every bite before it was all gone. If you love burgers or just want a great spot to eat at then try this place out. You're not going to lose. Thanks Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"We had been so excited to try bachi for the longest. It have to say we were a little let down by the food and especially the service. Our waitress started off fine but then disappeared after our food came out our water stayed empty for forever and had to ask another waitress for water. The bahnmi was a little bit of a let down especially since I love bahnmi sandwiches and the meat was over cooked. The shogun was cooked well and was tasted yum. Oxtail chili cheese fries were good, not mind blowing like I had hoped. Pork belly bao were a let down as well, very little meat and the steamed buns were almost cold and stiff. Our waitress finally came back and apologized for the long absence due to a large order and took our dessert order. Dessert and our to go order took forever. Overall I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me about this spot n it was the first place I wanted to try when we arrived in vegas. I loved it. So many things to pick from.. we couldnt decide cuz everything sounded so tasty! We ordered the oxtail fries n they were perfect. Crispy salty sweet rich.. also the spicy miso burger which was also cooked perfectly. Tender juicy patty fluffy buttery bun. All the flavors n textures blended well together. Also, we had amazing service. Thank u! I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My shogun burger with the foie gras was so yummy! I ate every bit of it.
My hubs did not like his bahn mi burger, he felt that the texture and flavors did not go well together. He tried mine and said it was good.
The truffle fries were a tad soggy.
My friend had the pork belly buns and she said it was good.
Next time hubs will have to try the other burgers to see if it's better."}

Burger: Kiki Burger w/ extra bacon
Fries: Parmesan Truffle Fries well done!

THE BEST BURGER SPOT EVER, been a loyal fan of this place since it has opened!"}
{"text":"We went back yesterday close to the brink of starvation ordered the Ronin burger, Kalbi burger and some truffle parm friezz.  Okay, maybe not to the brink of starvation, but boy were we hungry and gobbled everything down in probably 5 minutes flat!  My original fav was the Kalbi burger, but this time Ronin wins.  Who can turn down the fried egg in it and zippy horseradish based sauce on the side.  Delish!  And, as usual, the parm friezzzz were bomb diggity and service was sketchy.  

Conclusion:  Still a happy camper over the food."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had! The burger I had left me sick for 3 days the first time I came here. The 2nd time I came I waited for 40 minutes just to get a glass of water and greeted. The worst!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Bachi Burger. I've been here a few times, hoping that the visit before was just a fluke, but nope, Bachi is not for me. The service is fine, the waiters attentive, and I really enjoyed the fries, but there was just something off to me about the flavor of the burgers. Maybe it's just me because the people I go with enjoy the burgers, but it is what it is.

The latest visit was with a friend of mine from out of town and I wanted to take him to a burger joint off the Strip. We ordered edamame as our appetizer and truffle parmesan fries. I ordered a Kiki's Burger (angus beef, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli) and while I finished the burger, I tried really hard to not show on my face that I thought it tasted off. My friend enjoyed his burger just fine which makes me happy, but I did not enjoy mine. I had hoped it would because I love mushrooms! Everything about the burger on paper sounds great. It's just something about the sauce or something that makes me not want to order it again."}
{"text":"The Kiki burger is the ultimate burger. I always order it cooked medium, unfortunately, it was medium well. This has happened in the past. Medium well really hurts the flavor, moisture and texture. Next time, I will send it back. I look forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Bachi burger. We were seated right away and was served our drinks promptly. The food is just very good, I ordered the Kalbi Burger and my friend ordered the kiki burger with a fried egg added. There's something about the buns that make each and every bite so savory. We got the parm fries and the salt and pepper fries, both were very tasty. I finished my burger within minutes, and one of the owners came out to check on us to make sure everything was good. 

I like how they're open nice and late as well. Even picked up a few gingerbread man cookies on the way out the door as gifts."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here, it's awesome. We have nothing like it in Jacksonville and the dishes are so unique and flavored so well that you ask yourself \"why didn't I think of that?!?\" 

This go around, me and my buddy had the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork buns, Kiki burger, ronin burger and the Parmesan truffle fries. 

The oxtail chili cheese fries were really good. The oxtail was so tender like pulled beef and made the chili so much better than just regular ground beef chili. 

The pork buns were great! The pork belly was braised really well and the pickle and eggs together in the bun made the perfect combo. The side sauce (homemade hoisin?) was the kicker that sent it over the top. 

The burgers are sooooo good here and so original. It's hard to describe the intense Asian flavors and the combinations that each burger has. All I can say is that you must try for yourself. Every burger I've had here has that perfect balance to create a tsunami of umami. Sweet, salty and savory mixed with sour pickled... And that potato bun... two perfect pillows holding everything together. 

The Parmesan truffle fries are everything you expect. Shoestring fries topped with Parmesan cheese with a hint of truffle and topped with a porcini sauce. Really good side dish for the burgers. 

Service was impeccable and the cleanliness was comforting. Always a great experience and will always come back!"}
{"text":"They got rid of the Happy Hour menu and the result seems to be the place is empty.  We were all alone.  Food was good, though the burgers were not cooked as ordered.  The outstanding part: the caramel shake, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place was a find I watch triple DDD and I was NOT disappointed!!! Great service and I love love love their burgers, my daughter love the grilled cheese and veggies. I go back every chance I get do not have enough   Great things to say about it except TRY IT AND U will never find another burger like it"}
{"text":"Definitely recommended! It is a family friendly place with a twist. This place is not only trendy, but also very tasty.

The portions are a bit large. I had the black garlic ramen. It was not my favorite, but I took a bite of the Black and Green burger. I enjoyed the burger more. 

We also ended up ordering the fried calamari, oxtail fries, and the truffle fries. These are an absolute must. They compliment the burger very well.

Overall, this place is a great place to visit if you are in town. It is definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Just don't know quite where to begin. When Bachi Burger first opened it was a culinary experience worth the prices of the food. Another couple, wife and I went on Sunday and what a change had happen since last visit, the wait staff was not the same for knowledge of the food on the menu and was confused easily. The appetizer of pork bellies on steamed bun turned out to be the best part of our meals. The burgers which are the star item on the menu seemed to have been downgrade in patty size by at least 30% and were over drenched with sauces, making the taste of the actual burger indiscernible. 1 appetizer, 2 orders of fries, 4 burgers and a couple soft drinks came to about  $120.00 with tip. I am only guessing but this sort of thing happens when business's are sold and to make more of a profit food quality is downgraded or the business has gotten so big that quality of food becomes over looked. As for me we could of had just as good of conversations, had we went to Wendy's for doubles and fries and way much cheaper. Sorry but iBachi was so good when it first opened here in the valley. Bachi Burger has gotten my last dollar and I will surely tell my friends to steer clear.."}
{"text":"so sad... oxtail fries.. was just like reg chili cheese fries.. oxtail where? had to try the foei gras even though i was really feeling the spicy miso burger.. 26$! for the showgun or shot gun burger whatever! it was a long wait and i was hungry and dissapointed .. walked out of there with the same facial expression as this other group now we know why they were not smiling"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my visit to Bach Burger for the first time. We took out of town guests here telling them how great it is. We waited 45 minutes for a table. I m so confused what happened to the Spicy Miso burger. I have had it a couple of times at the Summerlin location and loved it! This time the burger was smothered in a red sauce that tasted very similar to the sauce on the Kalbi burger. My friend got the Kalbi burger and although I love spicy, kimchi, and kalbi, that burger just did not have a good flavor. The sauce was something like a Sriracha sauce but overpowered the entire burger. 

Also, I have tried the Truffle fries here and don't like the taste. The salt and pepper fries have a strong pepper taste and among 4 people we did not even finish 1/3 of the fries. The sweet potato fries are the best among the fries choices but the dipping sauce it comes with is gross. Way too sweet and strong of a taste, not complimenting it at all. 

I don't know if it was an off night or the chefs are just not as good or ingredients used were different. I really don't know why the experience was so different from the Summerlin one. We are big Bachi Burger fans and tell people we meet everywhere to try it and it's too bad this was a bad experience for the high price."}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever had.   I will definitely be coming back.    Truffle Parmesan fries and mocha almond fudge shake are the Bomb.  4 thumbs up
Miagi burger is my fav."}
{"text":"Came out to Vegas to attend my good friend's bachelorette and us girls made a stop at Bachi Burger (we took a cab to get here)! Best decision ever! We ordered so much food, I tried a bit of everything from fries, a variety of appetizers, and different wagyu burgers, and they all tasted soo good! The wagyu beef patties are incredible! I could definitely taste the difference from other beef patties that I had ever had - definitely the best beef patties I have ever had! Nothing will ever be the same.. and in the words of a good friend of mine (who is also an absolute foodie) -these will \"change ya life!\"

Thank you to the beautiful bride, my beautiful friend, for suggesting this place - I am forever in your debt. The foodie in me is so happy."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is the bomb!! I love a great burger and fries and this is the place to come if that's what you're looking for! You will pay a little more than your standard burger joint but you will really get a quality product."}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere. Ate at the bar because there was a line but fun to watch the kitchen and see all the tables! Great food! Large portions! We had the lamb burger and the fish sandwich! So good as in over the top! The dessert of Portuguese donuts and ice cream was sooooooo good! A must stop when near Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"A lot of creative options on the menu especially for a burger place. If you haven't had it the bone jam it is worth every penny. I also had the Kiki burger which was good but could have done without the sweet onion marmalade. Great lunch choice."}
{"text":"Arrived at Bachi Burger and waited 15 minutes for Saturday afternoon lunch.

Sat down and declared that I saw their episode on DDD and was fasinated with their menu. 

Started with
*Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.5 (With Garlic Aioli ,Fried Egg) [5 of 5] - Wasn't expecting much from putting stewed oxtail over fries. I was so surprised how delicious the oxtail was. I under-estimated how different and tasty this dish was. The oxtail actually had really nice heat flavor and by far, one of the best chili fries dishes ever.

Finished with
*The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger $9 (Angus Beef ,Pork ,Shrimp ,Lemongrass,Pork Pate ,Fresh Herbs ,Curry Aioli,Pickled Vegetables ,Nuoc Mam Sauce) [5 of 5] - Wasn't expecting this to taste so good, but blown away at how well all the meat flavors blended so well. And dipping the burger into their housemade fish sauce, took it to another level.

This place can brag about their burgers all they want, because it is all that. I think this is probably the best and most creative tasting burger places by far."}
{"text":"I love bachi burger, I've been coming here since the original location years ago. The Russell location is not as good as the one on the strip. Russell location messes my order up every single time we come here and one time they had blamed me that there was no onion in my burger and CLEARLY there was onions and eventually the manager had to come and apologize for his server being a complete asshole. Everytime I come here the girls are always bitches and I don't understand because we come here once and over tip every single time. Love this place hate this location. Always terrible service."}
{"text":"Hooray!  Bachi Burger, the famous fusion burger joint in town has expanded and landed in the west side of town.  Hearty burgers and delicious sides were calling my name!

Walking in, looks like they've done a swell job of decorating.  It looks modern, clean, hip and still features photography from artists posted on their walls.  Service was snappy, responsive and done with a genuine smile.

On to the food!
1.  Calamari - Bachi Burger has taken this appetizer to a new level.  The bits of squid are fried delicately and they stay crunchy.  Tossed in are bits of mint, grilled cherry tomatoes and slices of grilled lemon, turning the dish into something light and flavor blasted.  The sauces paired were the traditional tartare sauce and a green chili sauce.  What I found was the best flavor combo?  Double dipping the tarter and the chili sauce!
2. Ronin Burger - My Angus Beef was juicy and tender.  The caramelized onions and miso goma dressing enhanced the beef flavor.  The Japanese Cole Slaw added the perfect refreshing crunch and the runny yolk from the fried egg always add a extra bonus factor - GOOEY!.  If the sauces inside weren't enough, I also chose to dunk the burger in the citrus aioli for an extra flavor blast.
3.  Miyagi Burger - Is this a new one?  I'm not sure that I've seen it at the other location, but this tasty as well.  Where the Ronin provided a \"refreshing\" burger (if burgers could be refreshing), the Miyagi provided a \"extra savory\" experience.  It too had a juicy meat patty and a fried egg, but what makes this one stand out is the sea aroma from the furikake.  Mmmm mmmm seaweed bonus.
4.  Truffle Parmesan fries - Of course we need some spuds to go with our burgers!  This is a seriously addicting side dish.  Shoestring fries drizzled with their special concoction of truffle oil and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Conclusion:  These past few years have grown in the fusion food world, and Bachi brings it to the next level with the excellent quality of food and service.  They have this new location dialed in!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the last two times the service was horrible! Today it was slow and I was waiting by the host stand just got completely ignored and ended up walking out. Just because of that I will never go back! Great job on acknowledging your customers"}
{"text":"I have to hand it to Bachi Burger, they exceeded my expectations. I had the Kiki Burger, my hubby & friends the Banh Mi Burger featured on DDD. Fantastic! In fact I dare say it was one of the best burgers I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The bun divine. Medium is very red. It could have been hotter. Yet, It left me craving for another the next day. The Parmesan fries were luke warm too but good in flavor. The service was almost unforgivably slow but friendly. The atmosphere was casual but nice. 4 stars for those two reasons, but I will def give it another try."}
{"text":"I soooo wanted to love this place.  I still haven't found a place I'd like to regular in Summerlin;(

We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Thursday, there was a lively crowd...maybe about 20 people.  It only took a moment to be acknowledged and then seated by the hostess.  For some odd reason, the hostess seated us  at the least desirable table (nearest to the restrooms) although there were plenty of open tables.  The restrooms were not separated by a door or curtain from the dining hall.  So my husband (the polite gentlemen he is) sat in the seat that looked into the restroom hallway. Anyway, we did ask to move, which our waitress happily obliged.  

We ordered our drinks.  Plenty of beers and signature Saki cocktails, but only a few wines by the glass, but in their defense that had atleast one of each of the most popular varietals (e.g one chard, one pinot grigio, one cab, one merlot, one zin, and one pinot noir).  The waitress took our order as soon as we came back with our drinks, because we were ready.  While I didn't see it on the menu, but saw it on their website, I asked her if they had the Shogun burger (which was my main draw to this restaurant), she said they don't serve it at the Summerlin location.  Bummer.  I had to pick an alternative...more on that later.

Between ordering our drinks and our meal, we had a chance to look around and observe the atmosphere. The scene is young, hip, kind of alternative, yet still had a bit of that \"Chinese restaurant\" look due to the chairs.  Not tacky by any means, but did take it down a notch.  I appreciated that the restaurant attempts to support its local roots by hanging art by local artist that can be purchased and also being mindful of the environment by sending their compostable waste to Cowboy Trail Farms for reuse.   I did think it was a little too much to be showing Food Network on one TV and The Cooking Channel on the other TV...I suppose it could be a good plug for them if DDD comes on, but then again the dinners already know about this place;)

Our order came in a timely manner. We shared an order of the salt and pepper garlic fries, my husband got the Miso burger and I got a bunless Kiki burger.   We expected the fries to be thicker cut, but they were shoe strings garnished with salt, pepper, jalapenos and cilantro with a side of garlic aioli. They were tasty, especially with the sauce.  The first thing we noticed that the burgers were appetizingly big, which justified the price, even making it seem like a value.   We took our first bites, we both thought they were overly sweet.  While I understand the presence of all flavors, we thought there was an imbalance towards sweetness coming from the burgers being overly dressed with sauce.  In addition the burger meat was not seasoned but maybe that was intentional as to not compete with the sauces and condiments that are on top of it. Either way...both burgers were too saucy to eat neatly..my Kiki had too much onion marmalade and his Miso burger had  too much apple vinaigrette.  Besides the bun of the Miso burger was too flimsy to hold up to the saucy mess.  As we continued to eat, we really felt the need for salt to counteract the overly sweet toppings and to season the beef.  Adding salt did enhance the meat, but didn't really blunt the sweetness.  Sad since, the beautiful meat that has been so consciously sourced and carefully selected should be highlight, and possibly a light sprinkle of salt would have enhanced its greatness. 

As we continued to finish our burgers, we became more and more bummed it was not what we thought it would be and definitely didn't live up to the hype.  Still I like Bachi Burger's expression of its passions and consciousness of the environment and its local community, I just hope it can improve on its uniqueness!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice (can;t really be a regular from the Los Angeles area), but both experiences were impressive.

First time around, I had the Kiki.  The first bite was unexpectedly sweet, but after allowing the flavors to merge I was able to see how the sweetness fit with the profile.  I wanted a good burger, and this satisfied.  I left with a smile on my face.

I had it with a side of truffle fries.  Every visit from that point until the end of time will consist of an order of truffle fries.  While most of the truffle fries I've had are constructed with thin-cut fried and a generous coating of white truffle oil, these are not.  The fries ARE thin-cut, but the truffle flavor comes from an emulsion that is squeezed on top like it were some cheap ketchup.  Cheap ketchup this is not.  This is what every truffle wants to become when it grows up.

The second time around, I had the miyagi-san.  I was hesitant.  Some places will take something ordinary, throw some furikake on it, then call it fusion.  My hesitation was unwarranted.  The miyagi-san has become my standard at bachi.  

The CFC (chili fried chicken) is a treat.  Little nuggets of sweet, spicy, crispy chicken.  Easy to enjoy up front, but enough flavor depth for a foodie to love.

Cherry Yuzu Soda...order it.  You'll want to down it.  Go ahead and down the first one.  Take the second one more slowly.  You'll enjoy it more, i promise."}
{"text":"Normally come here for the awesome burgers (highly recommend the KALBI burger) but have been getting the ramen as of late. Ordered the black garlic tonkatsu ramen and it hits the spot!  Creamy broth with two types of meat, hard boiled egg but they keep the yolk nice and \"runny\" (cooked but not all the way thru). Ordered a side of gyoza (had to ask for the sauce as they did not present it) and a side of fries with the truffle parm option. The food was good but the service as of late has been hit or miss, seems like new faces everytime I go. Not bad, just not consistent. All in all a great experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Took my dad to Bachi Kitchen as he loves his burgers. He ordered the wagyu and I had the kalbi burger. Both were excellent and packed with flavor. We ordered \"just fries\", nothing special but not bad. We started with one server and another caught the tail end of our meal, second was Elise, she was awesome. Kudos guys keep doin what you're doin!

Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was it was friggin cold in there brrrrr"}
{"text":"There was this guy named mark who worked there he was just dreamy so handsome and he described the Wagu beef in a way that almost made me orgasm! Mark is a pure treasure and I bet he is as delicious as the burgers."}
{"text":"This place is good. I had the Kalbi burger, my friend had the Kiki burger and we shared the oxtail chili fries. The burgers are huge with lots of unique flavors. Personally it was a bit too much for me, I like thinks pretty simple. But it's nice to try new things."}
{"text":"My group of 3 and 20 other people sat and stared waiting for a half hour at 6 open and set 4 top tables. The hostess is completely clueless and should fired immediately. Food was good but their incompetence ruined it for me. Plus, I didnt like getting charged $1.50 for parma cheese when it was supposed to be on the fries that I ordered..."}
{"text":"A Lil on the expensive side but by far the best had oxtail fries as the appetizer and my burger was amazing might attempt to recreate the lonely bird burger"}
{"text":"We went here in a whim for a date night, the wait was around thirty minutes but it was worth the wait. My boyfriend ordered the original nacho burger and was very pleased with it. We shared the just fries and I highly recommend them: they were amazing!! I had the ramen and it was delicious and very filling. It was a great date night"}
{"text":"Seriously summerlin bachi burger you are killing me. I just want to order for pick up and your gd phone never works. Will just start going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a must have when in Las Vegas! We used to live in California and their Pasadena location is not as good as this location..umm maybe because this is the original. Wish they open up a location in North Dallas then we will be a happy camper...lol

We had the wagyu burger which was so moist and had lots of flavor. Their fries are oily and to die for then everything else is awesome. Just try it, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Ooooh Bachi, I keep coming back for you. You are the reason why we go to Las Vegas...lol

The best burger place ever! Will not say anymore, you just need to try it for yourself. Always packed:)"}
{"text":"This place never fails to disappoint . The Kalbi burger is yummy always add an egg . And the oxtail fries are a must try . The service is not bad . The drinks are pretty good ."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars

- 2 stars for greedy manager(/shift leader). 
That Mexican manager tried to cheat me of my change. The bill came out at $28, I gave him $40, he asked \"do you need change man?\" I told YES. He went away for like 10 minutes talking to his co-workers (at the time, there was no one else in the restaurant except me: 12:10am 8/15/13)
Finally I had to ASKED for my change back. What the .... was that kind of service?
I was very tired but I was not a fool ok.

Good food but bad experience.

Beware people"}
{"text":"Man this is my favorite place to eat in town period. The best burgers in town on or off the strip. Its like a Japanese Hawaiin infused burger place with a fun menu that is just oozing with creative takes on burger restaurant staples. The service is amazing (thanks Lantz) as well. They are very attentive and know their menu inside and out. If you go make sure to try the Wagyu burger, get an extra patty, some bacon,  throw a fried egg on it and add some shishito peppers wash it down with Morimoto Soba ale then get the pop tart with plum ice cream for dessert. You will cry."}
{"text":"I had there oxtail fries and I was not a fan you need to like it in order to enjoy it. I also had the pork belly and I was not sure if I did or didn't like them. But everyone tastes bugs are different we also had the kiki burger n that I loved so good. I would come here again when am in town but not get the fries nor the pork belly."}
{"text":"Delicious food however it came out as if it has been sitting waiting until it was served and , the staff seems to be unorganized walking around everywhere with tables needing to be cleaned and about five tables waiting for their food. I'm not sure what's going on in the kitchen, but they need to start pushing food out quick and cooking them in a timely manner. Not sure if I would come back.."}
{"text":"I would have liked to write a great review, but when I took a cab ride ($60 with tip round trip) to your place you were closed, your website said the hours may vary on 4th of July, but DIDN'T say closed all day. So That Sucks a big one!! You owe my cab fare Bro!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food ! Love the truffle fries and keli burger! Waiters seem stoned  lol"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot, stopped by randomly and enjoyed every last bite. The quality of the food is amazing, the service was beyond good and we only waited about 2 minutes to be sat."}
{"text":"So many great reviews I had to try.  First try I didn't check and went on a monday and they were closed boo....

I had their regular burger with bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo....and....drum roll....the Bacon was really tasty.  That was the only thing that really stood out.  The presentation was good too...But the burger itself was pretty bland.  Maybe ive been spoiled with so many gourmet burger joints in california and vegas....but the bachi version was ok.   I didnt try any of their other specialty version as im not too fond of some of the items.

The seating arrangement was nice, i liked the decor, and service was good as well.  Looked liked they may be able to some outdoor seating?  shrugs...perhaps it is too hot in vegas....

I would come again if i was hosting an out of towner who wanted an away from the strip experience...

we ordered 2 versions of the fries...and both were just a ok.  the truffle fries and some other ones with cilantro in it.  

I think they tried to get a bit too creative ... at least for my taste."}
{"text":"This IS the place for amazing food and sevice. Cody was the best server, he helped us order, told us about the sauces on the table, was fast and friendly.  The food as always was superb! The Ronin burger is our favorite,  with oxtail fies of course!  Delicious! !"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning there! My friend and I went for lunch and by the weekend, we were both sick from the food. The worst part is, when I called to inform them, no one carried and no one followed up it. So eat here at your own risk, I am sure the same lack of care for making me sick is the same lack of care in which they treat all food safety. Since this review, the restaurant was closed for health reasons. I am not surprised."}
{"text":"I have never had Bachi Burger and was very excited to try as I have heard great reviews about the food. When we arrived it was an hour + wait and we still put our name down. We came back 45 minutes later and found out a different lady was working and had skipped us. When asked she made it aware to us she skipped us even though we were there earlier than our spoken time. The hostess that was working 2/17 between the time of 2:30-3:00pm with black glasses and nose ring was extremely rude and condescending and we then told her that we would not be eating there due to her rude energy. If you cannot serve do not be in the service industry. Sorry Bachi Burger but one rude employee can tarnish a lot. On to the one at Sahara!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about Bachi from friends so we decided to give it a try while here on a recent vacay. 

Food: 
Ronin burger, pork belly buns, oxtail chili fries. Everything was good by itself but it was a little too overwhelming flavor-wise when eaten together. I'd suggest getting a simpler order of fries if ordering a more elaborate burger or vice versa. 

Something that bothered us though at this place was the abundance of flies. We kept getting harassed by a few flies during our meal and the other table next to us kept having to swat them away too. When we left, we noticed a whole swarm of them just outside the restaurant. Not sure if this is indicative of a sanitation issue but it definitely took away from our experience so taking a star off for that."}
{"text":"Late night dinner with the hubby after a 4hr drive from L.A. It was 12 midnight and were craving for burgers, I'm glad they're open until 2:00am on a Friday night.

Mr Ho - I love the burger patty that is a mixture of  pork and beef, sweet sauce and chinese sausage on a taro bun. Amazing flavor in just one bite, but if you're not a fan of sweet food this burger is not for you.

Mr Miyagi - Husband loved this burger. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and not sweet. I love the crispy onions on it.

Truffle fries - the bomb! I've had truffle fries before but this is the best truffle fries I've ever had.

I'm glad they're opening a branch in Los Angeles in 2013. Yey!"}
{"text":"Best burger in my life hands down. Not talking about a specific one either.. All of them are ridiculously good, even the fish. A tad pricier then your average spot; however, ingredients are several notches above, service is fantastic, and you get a ton of food. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"Travel a few off the beaten path or strip if you will, and you will find burger greatness. I ate many a heart attacks especially when they note grass fed or Kobe and for some reason they just don't measure up. Bachi on the other hand has created magic. The flavors just meld together wonderfully. Most notable were the Kiki burger and the pork belly thingy in the bun, oh wait, and the oxtail fries. The Kiki burger blew away the kalbi burger in terms of transcending flavors bursting in your mouth. People love in n out, fat burgers, smash burgers, but they're just burgers. If you are looking for burger perfection you need to go to bachi."}
{"text":"Wow, that's what I kept saying as my palate was having an orgasm over the Miyagi burger. I wandered in here with some friends after a day club party, with a deep desire for something hot and juicy. Ericka our waitress was easily the coolest ever, the best service 3 dumb drunkards could ever wish for. Combined the burger with the sweet potato fries, I was shaking. Burger purist go stand in the corner, nobody cares what you think. Open minded burger enthusiast you're welcome. This is bucket list shit. DO IT."}
{"text":"Far out! Burger lovers unit at this place. Had to come after hearing so much about it. Had the blue and green burger...omg...my tongue died and went to heaven. You will not be disappointed by the food or service!"}
{"text":"A very very different take on burgers and bar food!

I heard a lot about this place, but being from the bay area back in CA, I don't visit Vegas often to check out most of these places. Asking my local friends about where to eat, they all recommended this one. Theres another location in LV, but this was closer to our destination. I think it was a weekend, so we had to wait about 45~ minutes. I wished there was a bigger waiting area, its only a little nook near the entrance.

Once seated, we were assisted right away, which is a plus in my book. We decided to check out some of the fries as appetizers. Specifically, we got an order of Ox Tail Fries and Truffle Parmesan. The Truffle Parm fries were good, but if you needed to try something, you gotta go for the Ox Tail ones. Imagine chili cheese fries, but super duper upscaled. The meat is super tender. I'd probably get an order to myself when I go again!

For the main course, I ordered the Miyagi Sans Burger. Its like an upscaled version of a western cheeseburger. Grassfed Beef, onion rings, and an egg! It was sooooooo good. They have a lengthy menu, that I would love to try more and more.

Definitely check them out! Theres a burger for anyone!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is hands down has the best tasting burgers I've ever eaten at a restaurant. What is it that I love about Bachi Burger? The fact that I can have Wagyu patty burgers with any of their superb combination of toppings. So why am I giving it 4 stars? Its simply because the food is very pricy for what you get. Don't get me wrong, the portions are reasonably sized; however, the amount you pay for what you're getting and the amount you're getting is a bit unbalanced. You pay roughly $14 for a single burger with no sides included and you pay roughly $5 for fries with a truffle sauce. So your meal of burger + fries already comes out to be $19 not including tip+tax or drinks/dessert.

But enough of the bad, this restaurant lives up to its reputation in terms of food + service. I've always been professionally served by my waiters and waitresses. They are kind and always attentive the few times I've been here. The food has always been consistently good too. I usually ask for medium-rare to medium depending on my mood and my burgers have always come out perfectly every time. I also love the blends of flavor that they created in their menu. I usually have a hard time deciding what my palate wants when I read their menu. The ambiance is also nice here. The atmosphere is not too loud, although I was seated by one noisy table once. The seats are comfortable and they usually have ESPN/Food Network playing on their televisions.

All in all, if your wallet can afford Bachi Burger, I highly recommend it. Its a great treat to take yourself and a date to every once in a while."}
{"text":"When I come to Vegas I don't like to leave the strip but I was sure glad I left this time around. This place is RIDICULOUSLY BOMB! 

I didn't even have enough time to take pictures of my food because I was too busy shoveling it into my face..LOL 

This place is a MUST if you're willing to leave the strip."}
{"text":"Burgers here are the amazing. Yes it is pricey but they're such a good quality.  They offer different styles of burgers, with different sauces and add-ons, some may have kimchi, some others may have an egg, or shishito peppers . They're different, kinda like with an Asian twist. However, you can still just order a regular burger . The wauyu burger is delicious. Their sides are awesome too. Try the oxtail fries or just truffle fried. So yum!!! - excellent service too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding.  We shared a whole lot of burger and an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries, that are just as ridiculous and ridiculously good as they sound.  I have not a single complaint about anything we had.  Can't wait for a return engagement."}
{"text":"The word bachi means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.                                                                                            
That's sweet...but that's not why I came to Bachi! This is why I came:

\"Grilled to your desired temperature, our burgers are glazed and caramelized over an open flame using a proprietary soy, sake, and mirin-based marinade. The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye\"...GOOD GOD!

Bachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe. 

The menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.

Since I don't make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:

Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg

Watermelon Milk Tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkA

We started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had. 

Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. 

Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It's worth leaving the strip for. TRUST"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my boyfriend visiting from LA. We've had many different burger places and decided to give Bachi a try. 

Service: 
Gary served us and he was very attentive. He was the only one at the front of the house and greeted us as soon as we walked it. He gave us the freedom to choose our seats but that's because we were the first ones in restaurant. :) Once we got our food he came to check on us but wasn't overbearing. 

Presentation: 
The presentation was above par of most burger restaurants. The plates were clean, the garnishes were bright, and the food looked very appetizing and came out in a timely manner. 

Food: 
We ordered the pork belly steamed buns, bone marrow, the Bachi fish sandwich, wings, fries and a Thai tea. 

Pork Belly buns - came with 3, the pork belly was tender and cut thick, comparable to thickness of your index finger. The hard boiled egg added a nice to it. 

Bone marrow - came with 7 pieces of bread (a little less would've been okay). The marrow was slightly sweet because of the jam and not too oily. 

Bachi fish sandwich - served with raw tomato and raw unions giving the sandwich a fresh taste. The tartar sauce was light. None of the ingredients overpowered the fish and it was a nicely balanced fish sandwich. 

Crispy tebasaki wings - fairly large and crispy. It was garnished with pickled radish, which went perfect with the wings. The flavor tasted like a sweet soy. 

Salt and pepper garlic  fries - the fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, it lacked the garlic flavor. The garlic chili aioli sauce paired great with the fries. This had a perfect amount of heat and acidity. 

Thai tea - Their tea is average and less sweet than most. If you are a Thai tea lover, you know the sweetness level I'm talking about! 

Overall, excellent dining experience. Compliments to the Chef and Management Team. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I guess I am the only one who hated the food at this place.

First of all the service was not good, it took quite awhile longer than one would expect to get our burgers. I got the 'Black and Green Burger' which was recommended to me by the server. This had a very strong and weird alcoholic taste to it. It was gross. And by gross I don't mean it was only \"decent\" I truly mean it was gross. 

I will never go back."}
{"text":"The burgers are the best in town!  Only thing that hurts the rep is the spotty service.  Mr. Miyagi and kimchee burger are my favs!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Bachi Burger was an amazing experience. However I've been multiple times after that and the food is good but not great. I really enjoy the oxtails fries  and the selection of ramen. The service is always good and they're always nice. I just wish the dining experience was consistent."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few months back. I had never heard of it and had no expectations other than some of my friend saying it was a really good burger place. 

Went with a group of about 15 so we had to wait about 20-25 minutes which was fine considering our group took a little while to filter in. 

Everyone on yelp and in person raved about the oxtail chili cheese fries. So we got a couple orders to share amongst the group. All I had to say was... OMG!! The chili was flavorful. The fries were my perfectly fried in my opinion: nice and crispy on the outside with the right amount of creamy potato goodness on the inside. The oxtail moist and delicious. 

Per the server's suggestion, I ordered the Miyagi-San for my burger. When it came, it looked good. It was a pretty hefty burger. But, nothing will compare to that first bite. I died. It felt like the perfect fusion of a burger and Asian flavors. Perfectly cooked to my medium-rare order. Juicy. Savory. Simply amazing. 

A lot of people compare it to Umami Burger over here in CA. In my opinion, I liked Bachi better. But I hear it's a pretty close race and all a matter of preference (much like the in-n-out / shake shack debate). 

Fast forward to this past weekend...

I took a group of friends who had never been here before. I told them it was definitely worth the price (~$10-$26 for a burger). 

We got a few appetizers because it was our only meal that day. Ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle Parmesan fries, and pork belly buns. 

While all delicious, the pork belly buns were definitely the hit! The pork belly was so moist and melted in your mouth. For some, these were the highlight of the whole meal!

For our burgers, a lot of my friends ordered the Miyagi-San per my suggestion and they loved it! The few that ordered something different (myself included; spicy miso, kalbi, and banh mi burgers) still thought they were good, but not to the same degree as the Miyagi-San. 

Would definitely recommend this to everyone whenever they're in Vegas! And I hope the one in LA is completed soon so I can treat my stomach to this amazingness more often!"}
{"text":"I was with a group of about 12 so I was able to sample a few things on the menu. 
Onion rings- melt in your mouth. 
Brussel sprouts with bacon- tasty. 
Fried rice (yes, fried rice)- was different with great flavor. 
Calamari- cooked just right. 
For the finale, the Kiki burger which was completely different than any other burger I have ever had and it was great. 
The waitresses were efficient and friendly. Just make the drive off the strip, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was good. We ordered the Kalbi burger, edamame, Caesar salad, and beet salad. Prices were okay not too expensive. The reason I gave them 3 stars is that they don't do substitutions. My friend that ordered the beet salad did not want blue cheese but Parmesan instead. Our waiter told us okay no problem. It wasn't until we got the check that he told us they don't do substitutions and that it was $1.50 to put Parmesan instead. Super fast service probably because the place was empty."}
{"text":"This place smells amazing from the parking lot! I've been a few times & everything I try I always enjoy a lot. The burgers are large & juicy with unique twists & they serve Thai ice tea which is probably my favorite beverage ever. The service is ok, wish it was a little better. I say that because every waiter we've had has no personality. With that said the food always delivers so I would recommend it. 
The environment plays cool music & it's loud & lively which I enjoy. Casual spot & have been several times to both locations."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! The shrimp chips are awesome here!! Unique Asian-inspired burgers that are the bomb!!! The buns are so yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I lived in AZ ! Obsessed with their food! It's sooooooo good! The fries are always fresh! The burgers are amazing! Had a chance to try their wings ! It was very messy but so yummy! It's a must try! It's so good!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews on Yelp, I figured I'd give this place a try.  I love burgers and was craving something delicious.

The restaurant itself was pretty basic. The normal strip mall restaurant in Vegas. It was clean but small.

I had the Spicy Miso burger and it was good. I've had better at places like Umami or Plan Check in LA, but it was respectable.  The mix of egg, Angus and the shishito peppers with an apple vinaigrette was well done.  I'd probably go back.

Also, they were out of Blue Moon, which I read in another review here...you'd think they'd be able to stock more beer, how hard is that?"}
{"text":"This is the Alpha and Omega of all Hamburger venues. The gateway to all things good and just in the burger universe. 

I used to be obsessed with hamburgers and have tried them in many ways, shapes and forms all over the world.  Although there are many interpretations of \"The Hamburger\", typically, they all either tasted very similar, or very bad.

Bachi is the exception. 

It is my opinion that the Wagu Bachi Burger with cheese, double patty, is the greatest \"crossover-hamburger\" of all times. 

There are a lot of other great, and unique items on the menu, however, I would come just for the Burger. Furthermore, I would not diverge from the \"The Standard Burger\" on your first visit. They have all sorts of unique versions, however, trust me - just ask for the wagu with cheese and maybe a side of mayo. 

Yes, they are a little slow. So? It's worth it. 

Easy parking. Very nice staff. A fabled ramen bar in the back that may or may not ever open - but who cares? 

This review is all about THE BURGER. 

Japanese sweet yet grilled smokey heaven.

And yes, I feel awful for eating cows...But I was a vegetarian for many years and all it got me was sick, tired and longing for a burger...a Bachi burger!

Hurry , go now!!!"}
{"text":"I was DYING to get my hands on Bachi Burger! And I finally got the opportunity :)

I ordered for take-out since I was a little short on time, waitress was very nice and took my order. A little over 10 minutes later, boom! Bachi burger is in my hand.

I ordered the KiKi burger with a fried egg. Amazing. 

There were so many different tastes going on within this burger, I can't wait to go back! I want to try everything on the menu.

There was also a sign outside that mentioned they were going to be filming \"DDD\" (Food Network) on June 18th. I'm SO there.

2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing but not as amazing as David C. ! My friends and I LOVED him. Honestly the best server we ever had at a sit-down restaurant. Outstanding service , great personality , everything. Request him as your server !! Please."}
{"text":"First time there and the food was delicious!! If you love mushrooms get Kiki's burger. There was a little bit of a wait being seated, but the staff is very polite"}
{"text":"Another one of those \"why do we  keep going to bachi Burger?\" Experiences. Shift meeting at 6:00p. Stood at the hostess stand for 10 minutes before another guest went searching for someone. 

When the table next to us complained about their ramen, I knew what we were in for. 45 minutes later, the ramen comes out and it's not very good. The ni tamago wasn't seasoned. Just flabby garbage eggs. 

I think we are done."}
{"text":"Poor customer service... Parking at this location is atrocious.  Please be aware that this place is horrible for groups. I'm done with Bachi burger and the  poor customer service and food"}
{"text":"Hurray for Bachi.  Love the shogun burger here.  What kind go wrong with Foie Gras, Eel, and asian pears topping?  Nothing.  Especially enjoyable after two huge misses at Caesars Palace (Gordon Ramsey Pub and Serendipity 3).  We stopped here for lunch before heading back to Los Angeles on Saturday.  Service was fantastic (from a super cute waitress).  The only drawback was that the unagi was a bit \"chewy\".  So, I am wondering if that was undercooked.  But, I was so greatful so such yumminess, that I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars.

Food:  4.5 stars
Service:  5.0 stars"}
{"text":"Great presentation,tried the spicy Sriracha burger, truffle fries were great, service :ok, appetizers are better than the burgers to me. 


.....but G-Burger of La Habra, Ca STILL reigns supreme. Depending on your taste of course.."}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise! I was craving a burger in the Henderson area. I decided to try this spot. 

Starting off, I ordered the wings. I think they're called chili wings or something like that. They were cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the flavor! Sweet and spicy. Very good ;-)

Although they had interesting burgers with various toppings....I'm more of a traditional burger girl. I had a cheeseburger with bacon and regular fries. I was extremely pleased. The meat was cooked perfectly and the burger was topped with the most fresh condiments. The bun was steamed perfectly!!!! I didn't like the pineapple ketchup....more of a traditional regular ole ketchup girl. 

My boo ordered the spicy miso burger and was EXTREMELY SATISFIED!!!!!! Apparently that burger was popular amongst patrons. 

I'll definitely visit again. Maybe I'll try different burgers...."}
{"text":"I called in for pickup and they gave me an estimated time of twenty minutes. When I showed up twenty minutes later, the food wasn't ready and it took another half hour of waiting. The hostess did not seem to be listening when I walked in earlier- and fails to meet our needs. Slow service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! My fathers burger was burned the first time so they said \"oh your burger was overcooked so they're making you another one\" my family (there were 9 of us total) were finished eating and they still didn't bring his food out.  The waiter said oh I'll just take it off of your bill like that would solve it.  We asked for the manager and he said well the server said you ordered separately from the group so that's why your burger didn't come out.  Really!?  That's your lame excuse?  Why would anyone ever order later than everyone else their group?"}
{"text":"My brother brought me and my bf here, and we definitely loved it. The only downside is that most of the burgers are on the sweet side, which I don't prefer. But, they did have a savory burger, which hit the spot! It's called the Black & Green Burger. I always like my burger prepared this way (smoky sharp cheese such as blue and gouda with some spring mix greens and vinaigrette).

Their appetizers are also very indulgent. My personal favorite is the truffle parmesan french fries. It tastes the same as the truffle parmesan fries at Eat Chow in Newport Beach, but I think it has a stronger flavor than Eat Chow. We also got their famous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. This is good if you like meat on the sweet side combined with your traditional chili cheese fries.

Overall, good burger place in Las Vegas if you're looking for burger places like the ones in LA."}
{"text":"Food poisoning! Me and two of my coworkers are here and all got food poisoning. When I called to tell the restaurant the person I talked to didn't seem too concerned and then said the general manager would call me. It's been over a week and I haven't heard back.   It's now been 3 weeks and I still haven't heard back from management."}
{"text":"Hit the spot after traveling from the east coast. Tender burger with soft bun and delicious arugula and blue cheese...paired with great fries and pineapple ketchup. Cherry on top was the Rogue Hazelnut brown ale they had - one of our favorites!  Would love to have them outside of NV!"}
{"text":"First word that comes to mind is inconsistent. 

Brought my coworkers here a few weeks ago for lunch and everyone raved about their food, it was their first time trying this place. My Kiki burger which is my favorite was also really great. Everyone ordered burgers and their fries with pineapple ketchup which is so delicious. 

Came back last week to do it all over again and our experience was very different. The burgers weren't as juicy and barely warm. Weird because we were the only people dining at the time we arrived. The caramelized bacon wasn't cooked well so it was extra chewy and I had to get rid of nearly all of it and most of the mushrooms that come on the Kiki burger weren't cooked evenly because some of them were sliced thinly and others were very thick. Had to remove most of them as well. It was almost like a completely different burger :(

Service was off as well as our sever forgot our fries until nearly the end of our meal and wasn't around often to refill our drinks as she kept disappearing. 

I do like this restaurant and I feel like their other locations are much better but prices are high. A burger, fries and a drink will run you between $14-$18 for lunch. When the ingredients aren't cooked well it definitely doesn't make it worth it. 

Hopefully they can fix a few things and they should offer lunch specials with smaller burgers that come with fries. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Parking (3/5)
Location is in an awkward area, its behind Subway, so its easy to miss. Easy way to remember is to turn in when you see the Subway.

Atmosphere (4/5)
This place is trendy and the atmosphere suits the cool fusion food vibe. It also has home modern art when you walk into the restaurant. Ambience is on a bit noisier side but its suits the burgers and fries restaurant vibe. 

Service (5/5)
Service is excellent. When they were busy there is usually 20-30 minute wait. They will not sit you until everyone from the party is present. Waiters are excellent and they are not pushy. They will explain the menu and they will give you enough time until you have made your selection. Our waitress gave us a great service and took pic of our entire party upon my request. 

Food (4/5)
Let me be very clear here, I am reviewing the food, but I am also reviewing the value that you are getting for the food.

I went to this place for UYE that I hosted. I took pics of my friends food, but here is what I got.

Kiki Burger w/ Fried egg ($12.50)
Angus Beef patty, Sautéed Shiitake & Enoki mushrooms, Sweet Onion Marmalade, caramelized bacon, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli and Fried Egg.

The burger was very juicy and the meat was extremely tender. This burger is little bit sweet because of the marmalade. You can taste the gruyere cheese and the bacon in every bite. Getting an extra fried egg on this burger was a mistake on my part. I would not recommend it. 

Truffle Fries w/ pineapple ketchup ($6)
This was disappointing, fries were not fresh and there wasn't enough truffle sauce on the fries. I liked the pineapple ketchup, it made the stale fries worth eating. I would highly recommend it.

Overall (4/5), this is an excellent gourmet burger joint. If you want to get away from regular burger joints and try something new then this place is it, but you have to be ok with fusion food."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas & their oxtail fries are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I find people either love or hate it. I'm in the latter's camp. I guess I just don't understand why these are considered good burgers, especially when there are plenty of other gigs in town. I've been here twice just to be sure my first assessment was correct and because I have a friend who adores this place, but doesn't get to go often because his partner hates it. My second visit was like the first: lackluster, disorganized surface, and ok burger, followed by a $40 check for lunch which didn't include any alcohol. Maybe it's my indifference toward trendy that lends to this opinion."}
{"text":"Start off with oxtail chili cheese fries run move into the kiki's burger... By then no room for dessert! So amazing"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!!  Our server, Dan, was great... he went through the menu with us and had great suggestions depending on our likes.... he did not do us wrong!!!!  We started with the ox tail fries.... delicious!  I was surprised at how sweet the meat was, but the spicy from the peppers and onions was a great counter to the sweetness... I had the miyagi-san burger, and it was maybe one of the best burgers i have ever had!!!!  My boyfriend ordered the spicy miso burger, that too was pretty great!

I will def. be coming back!"}
{"text":"All you Yelpers out there, you are responsible for this.  Grin.

I have been reading so many reviews about Bachi Burger.  I got that holiday weekend craving for a burger, so I figured it was a SIGN.  Based on all the reviews, I decided to try the Kiki Burger.  I am salivating just thinking about that meal.  It was such a nice combination of flavors.  

The Kiki Burger is described on the menu as: 
Angus Beef  Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & 
Eryngii Mushrooms  Caramelized Bacon
Sweet Onion Marmalade  Aged Gruyere Cheese
Garlic Chili Aioli  =$10

I decided not to get anything else, just to focus on the burger along with the Plantation Iced Tea.  I am from the South so I know a thing or two about iced tea.  The tea was so nice and refreshing, with pineapple, mint and simple syrup to sweeten.  

I loved the very cool modern decor and the even cooler chill lounge music, if you call it that.  The whole restaurant had a very trendy, modern but casual vibe.  This is certainly a place I want to bring my friends.  Oh-yeah right, they've probably all already been here.  Still, I very much look forward to coming back soon and try the other creations.  

I loved the food, the atmosphere and the experience.  My only suggestion would be to think about cutting back the simple syrup in the tea maybe 1/3?

Let's get a group together and go back!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"First time here. Haven't seen anything like this in Southern California. Food was delicious!
Service could have been a little better, unfortunately it was understaffed. Would I go back?
Yes I would 
I highly recommend this place I loved the oxtail chili fries
and the burgers..... Yum!!
Shared the Ronin Myagi Something
Both were excellent burgers"}
{"text":"This was our first time here so maybe it was an off night. The server and all the staff seemed overwhelmed and it wasn't the busy. They were out of 3 item that we tried to order. I ordered my kids food and an appetizer then ordered food for my wife and I. Our food came out first. Just not what you would expect to pay over $100.00 for hamburgers. Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing this place profiled on one of Guy Fieri's programs on The Food Network.  This is an out of the way place for me.  The drive wasn't particularly worth it for me.  When we got there, the wait wasn't that long, considering it was a holiday.  Service was ok.  The burgers were spot on...very tasty, but I wouldn't drive here again.  Still deserves a 4-star rating, though."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5. Had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (not bad for a Friday night at 6 PM). I've eaten at the Bachi Burger in Henderson. also crowded and very busy. but in Henderson, the serving staff was friendly and welcoming. The waitress we had in Summerlin was almost hostile from the moment we sat down. The restaurant was very noisy, so it was hard to hear what was being said by the folks at the other end of the table. Our Kiki burger was very good. we also ordered the duck sliders to share. They came on a bao. While the bao was good, the duck was not. The fries were ordered to be made crispy. They were not. None the less, the sweet potato fries were outstanding as were the truffle fries.
So the 4 star rating was for the high quality burger and the excellent fries. I couldn't give a 5 star rating due to the rude server and the noise (a pity since it it next door to my favorite movie theater). I will go back to the Henderson Bachi Burger, not the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"Service is horrible especially when they get backed up. After a long wait and finally getting seated. Waiter never came to check on us, waited another 15 minutes - people that came after us got first. Didn't want to waste any more time so just left. 

I've been going here since they opened. But the service just seems to get worse and worse. This location is just not worth my time."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi Burger, where have you been all my life?! WOW!! I can't even tell you how much I enjoyed the Black and Green Burger. It has everything you could want in a burger: wagyu beef, bacon, 3 different types of mushrooms and blue cheese. Perfection! Top quality beef and thick cut bacon. Seriously? I can't wait to come back and try different burgers. Great food, great service! It's been a long time since I've said this, but this burger just made my top 3 favorite burgers of all time."}
{"text":"Amazing burger great service surprised to see it so quiet at 3:30 pm on a Wednesday.
If you want the best burger with an Asian flair in Las Vegas go to Bachi's"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the 2nd day it was open. They really have their sh#t together. For only being open 24 hrs, their staff was on par to the original location. Very attentive and the food came out just as good. The menu additions are pretty cool and I think staff is indicative of the...umm...\"environment\" *cough* Summerlin *cough* Convenient that there's one on the west side now, since I work over here."}
{"text":"Not that this place needs any more good reviews, but I was surprised at how good this place really was.  Came here with party of 4 straight from flight into Vegas.  The oxtail fries are everything the reviews say.  I had the Kiki Burger.  Burger was juicy, tasty and all the ingredients tasted fresh.  Why this chain has not yet made it out to No. CA is beyond me.  I also had the peanut butter chocolate shake ($6 and modestly sized), but really good.  I want to come back and try some of their other burger creations.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"It's been 5 years since i've been to Bachi Burger. I live in LA and have bragged to all my friends about this place after my visit 5 years ago.  
I finally made it back today.  What a disappointment. I can sum it all up in 1 sentence

They are out of business but just don't know it yet!! 

Slow Service, under staffed
Rude host / Buser / Manager 
Mediocre food at best
Dirty dusty restaurant 

What a shame!"}
{"text":"Largely regarded as one of the best places in the city for burgers- the reputation is justified! I'd rather spend $12-15 on a burger here than on the Strip- quality of beef and other ingredients is comparable (that is, top-notch) and combinations are fabulous.

KIKI'S BURGER: Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki &
Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli. Duh-licious. BF took one bite and said it's the best burger he's ever had. It will blow your mushroom-loving mind.

MIYAGI-SAN'S GRASS-FED WAGYU BURGER: Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings. An Asian take on a breakfast burger, the chili mayo kicks it up to awesome. Add more if you dare.

Service is stellar, call in your order for pick up- they require a card to place the order but you can use any form of payment when you get in to pick up."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to Bachi Burger and you'll definitely see me here again! I ordered the Miyagi burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries and they were both so tasty!! It was probably one of the best burgers I've eaten. The prices aren't too bad either; the burgers have an average price of $14. Our food came out fairly fast, but the only downfall was that our server was not knowledgable and did not take care of us that well. We asked him for his opinion on one of the seasonal burgers and he did not give us adequate information. Also, our table was so messy he did not even offer to clear up our dirty plates. Despite this, the food was superb and I'm definitely coming back to try something new!"}
{"text":"Although they brand their food as high quality ingredients, it didn't taste any better than a regular hamburger I can make myself at home with regular meat from smiths. And at 13 bucks a pop? Not nearly worth it. The \"family sized\" apps should be sued for false advertisement as they were simply a medium size plate barely full. In addition, every single thing was a la carte, resulting in a bill for four people being over 100 dollars, with only one cocktail ordered, which was quite disgusting. Moreover, the service was slow, discombobulated, and it was crystal clear there was absolutely no communication between anybody working there. I'm a very patient man, but waiting 20 minutes for a cocktail is unacceptable in a place that seats 50 people, with barely half the place full. Extremely disappointed after all the hype about this place had me all hyped up"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas and I really wanted to try this place.  So of course, being the spoiled princess I am from my friends, they came with me :'). I loveee my friends.  Anyways, one word, YUM!  My friend got the banh mi one, my other friend got the ronin? and I got the kiki's burger.  Mine was soooo good and man the burgers were freaking huge!  We also had truffle fries and the pork belly baos.  Was seriously stuffed to the max and I had such a hard time finishing my burger.  This place is so worth the try and I can see myself back here again !"}
{"text":"This place has lots of intriguing flavors. I had the Kalbi burger with house made kimchi. Without great fundamentals though, it would just be a bunch of flashy bells and whistles. Au contrêre mon  frêre. This place is awesome and the shakes and sweet potato fries are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"for yelpers from california that know about Umami burger, think about this place like that but the burgers portion are bigger. its one of those \"asian fusion\" east meets west interpretation kidda food but in this case it works! food are great and delicious tho i took out 1 star because of the service.

definitely gonna go back the next time we go back to Vegas! tho i heard their opening one here in Cali!"}
{"text":"The truffle Parmesean fries is my form of crack. I constantly crave them and I could eat 3 servings in one sitting. I've always created my own burgers so it's always been good. .. fun fusion menu. Hard to go wrong if you ask me"}
{"text":"Went to vegas during EDC weekend. Besides partying and getting hammer off free drinks from gambling I enjoy trying new places to eat. My brother had mention bachi burger for quite a while so I decided to try it out finally. When we first got there the wait wasn't too bad, it was only about 10-15 minutes or so. This was our first time here, the server asked us if we ever been here before since we said no she explained to us what the different types of burgers there were and what she recommended which was pretty helpful. We got the kiki and ronine burger and garlic fries. When the food came out we were all resisting not to eat any of the food since we wanted to snap a picture for facebook (who doesn't do that? lol) Anyways the first bite was amazing. It was so good and tasty. I'm not sure if we were just really hungry since we hadn't ate anything for about 15 hours or if it was really just that good. It was worth $12 bucks in my opinion and the fries was awesome as well. For sure next time i'll be sure to try the banh mi burger and oxtail chili fries. Makes me want to go back to vegas again already. Oh and btw, this place isn't exactly next to the vegas strip. Be prepare to drive a little. It's off blue diamond exit (silverton casino) and about 8 minutes once you exit the freeway. So if your planning to take a taxi it'll be about $20 bucks or more each way. Your better off driving there."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped.  Yes the food is more than just your regular burgers but for the price I expected better flavors and not just overwhelmed with grease."}
{"text":"Be patient...it takes a while for the burger. But worth the wait. Miyagi-san was awesome..."}
{"text":"My most favorite burger place ever! I visit this place with my girls every time we're in Vegas and I always joke around saying we're having breakfast, lunch and dinner here. I've been to a few in Cali and another location in vegas but I prefer this place because of their ramen! We always start off with the oxtail chili cheese fries. And for my burger, you can never go wrong with kalbi burger! I recommend everyone to try this place at least once. very satisfying. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here just after leaving the airport. Really tasty food, good service, nice place overall. I have no complaints especially with having a Bruery rotating tap!"}
{"text":"This is NOT the place to go if you have anywhere to head to afterwards.  Went in during the work week, it is right around the corner from my office.   Walked in at 12:10, were seated immediately (about 4 empty tables).  We had studied the menu online and ordered immediately, did not even get menus.  At 12:39 we questioned the where abouts of our burgers....  We were told they got slammed but ours were next up did we want our fries first, we said sure....  At 12:47 our burgers arrived, but no fries, we asked for to go boxes, our fries and our bill.   12:51 another laid back server stopped by asking if we needed anything we said yes, boxes, our other food and the bill....   12:53 boxes arrive....   12:56 bill arrives still no fries....  12:58 I walk over with the 33 dollar bill to the manager and ask how long it takes to make fries, he informs me it takes 6 minutes but they only have one fryer..  I suggest maybe then they only have 5 tables instead of the 20+ in the restaurant that their kitchen can't handle.  I inform him I am not paying a bill for food I haven't even received.  He asked what I wanted him to do about it.    I informed him I would not be signing the bill and I didn't want the food and I walked out.   

If it is a week day lunch hour, you INFORM your customer that you have 60 minute ticket times PRIOR to them ordering.  Give them the opportunity to walk out.  Also don't open a huge restaurant if you do not have the kitchen staff and equipment to serve your dinning room!!!!!!  This place is an absolute train wreck!!!!!  Will never go back, I don't care how great their burgers are."}
{"text":"the 'Banh Mi' burger was great ... took an old fashion Vietnamese staple and turned it into a burger. The peak hours were very busy and the kitchen was not able to keep up on a Sat afternoon. But the food and staff was worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Four stars is a bit generous considering my first experience to be maybe above average. 

Came on a Sunday night with my girlfriend. Very busy, yet we were immediately seated since the other parties consisted of high volume of guests while I was with just one other. A plus for that!

Upon seating, the waitress courteously greeted us and asked us if it was our first time. Confirming with her question, she gave her suggestion and what is considered the most popular three burgers on the menu. The Ronin, Kikis, and Banh-Mi burger is supposedly the most popular and preferable. My girlfriend ordered the Kikis and I ordered the Banh-Mi. 

I normally like my meat cooked in medium rare, however, the server suggested that we cook it to medium well because our patties are more than just beef. My patty consisted of shrimp and pork so medium rare would be overdoing these meats. So my girlfriend and I took her advice.

We waited about 20-30 minutes for our burger. Though busy, that is quite long. 
Finally after waiting, our burgers and one serving of \"just fries\" came. 

My burger was good but not great. I have definitely tried much better. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this unique style of burger. On the other hand, my girlfriend's Kiki's burger was delicious. It could use more veggies and more dressing but the meat combined with the bacon was stellar. 

Overall, an OK experience. My rating and review is definitely subject to change because my curiosity will bring me back to try the other burgers/ fries/ etc."}
{"text":"All my friends who went to Vegas seemed to have made a stop at this joint so I made it a point to check it out.  Looking at the menu, there were so many things I wanted to order and it took me a while to decide because everything sounded so appealing.  Finally went for the Miyagi-san burger and we also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries.  Definite comfort food!!!  Loved it and I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the other stuff on the menu.  This particular location was in a plaza so there's plenty of parking, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"New to the area and tried out this burger place. Upon waking in the establishment was clean and very welcoming. (Unlike the waiters) the menu was a good size and was very articulated which we loved. I ordered the Miyagi-Sans burger medium well. The burger itself was overcooked and burnt. I was a bit disappointed because I had to ask for mayo to make it less dry and lacked flavor. we also asked for our check to be separate and was met with a rude waiter. The whole night between him and his counter part it was a total turnoff. For a proxy burger I expected a bit more."}
{"text":"Omg this by FAR my favorite Burger Place in Vegas....... The bun ALONE is to DIE for.  #lifechanginglunchspot"}
{"text":"Gourmet Fukuburger!!! Need I say more?! (only applicable if you've tried it i guess) 

...ok read this: ASIAN FUSION BURGERS!!! i.e. the Ronin Burger consists of Carameled onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso Dressing, a a friggen fried egg!!! (yes its ok to drool) I love anything with a fried egg on top! Which brings me to their Oxtail chili cheese fries, yes fried egg topper! Ridiculous! I love their bao sandwiches also! Steamed buns stuffed with BBQ pork belly inside! 

I haven't had anything here that i don't like, and i hope it stays that way! I'll keep coming back till i have everything on their menu! Thats a promise! Cheeee!!!"}
{"text":"YUM.

I'm normally not a burger person- it's way too messy and greasy for me. For this place, I'd definitely make an exception.

I split oxtail chili cheese fries and a Shogun burger.
Fries: 8/10- I wish there were more oxtail meat in the fries- it was tender, soft, and super freaking delicious. But regardless, the fries are crispy and delicious! Definitely much more chili than fries needed- a good and perfect amount.
Burger: 10/10- ahmigaweeddddddddddd how can I describe it- buttery, meaty, sweet, and oh so just AH DELICIOUS. I had only half the burger but I was pretty satisfied. I really can't just simply describe it- you HAVE to try it. It's deliciously amazing.

Next time I go to Vegas, I'll definitely come back here. :D"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a few times. Each time service has been slow. I will never know why. It could be the kitchen got back up with orders, or maybe the waiters/waitresses put priority over other people for different reasons. 

I try to come here when it's not \"rush hour.\" Judging from people reviews they are slammed during rush hour which makes me believe the owners don't hire enough people. 

The food is good. I will comment the food is very good but to be honest it's easily strip prices for very simple food. I didn't know this restaurant was on diners drive ins and dives. I came here to try it because I live pretty close. Which in my opinion is overrated.

While the menu is different (Kalbi burger, truffle fries, wagyu burger, etc) I feel you can pay similar prices by actually going to an Asian restaurant and eat the actual food the burger is inspired by. 

This isn't a place I would go for burgers unless you want some fusion burgers."}
{"text":"Taking the Hamburger, but giving it an Asian twist -- I like it.

I've been here a few times, and have never left disappointed. If you're looking for a different spin on an asian burger, then Bachi is the place you want to be at.

I've eaten the Ronin and the Kiki, and they're both unique in their own right.

But what good is a burger without some fries to finish it off with? With three different types of fries to pick from, you can't make the wrong choice.

Now, if only the service while waiting to get a table wasn't so shoddy."}
{"text":"I found about about Bachi Burger watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  As I was watching, I realized this restaurant was practically in my back yard.  I read reviews and realized there might be a wait to eat, so chose a Sunday at 3:00 (in between lunch and dinner) to eat.  The wait was about 20 minutes.  I have since been back 1/2 dozen or so times.  The oxtail chili cheese fries are the BEST!!  I have ordered them every visit.  I've tasted about 4 or 5 of the burgers and they are all delish!  The buns are light and sweet.  There are different flavored aiolis if you are eating plain fries instead of chili cheese ones.  I recommend the garlic or the pesto aioli.  The service can be quite slow at times, and occasionally the wait time for a table can be 45 minutes.  For me, it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. We tried it out because the food pictures looked good and we saw it won some Las Vegas awards. 
Our credit card was charged $5000 (not an exaggeration) and we spent an hour on the phone days after our flight home contesting, we waited 20 minutes for a table when half the restaurant was empty, and we waited over an hour for our food. In the mean time, we watched a customer at a table next to us having an allergic reaction to the spices on his burger that he specifically told his server he was allergic to. To top it off, the burgers (Wagyu and Miyagi-San) were very average. 
Management needs to hire more staff or the staff themselves are inept. Either way, we will never step foot in another one of these restaurants again.

Service: 0 out of 5 
Food: 2 out of 5"}
{"text":"When we come into town we never miss going to Bachi Burger it never disappoints!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger places and burgers I've ever had. What I love most is that each burger is truly an individual. Each burger patty is seasoned according to the burger choice you order. I've so far tried the Kiki burger, the miyagisan, and the Ronin burger... And they all individually taste different and amazing. 

The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must try and the Parmesan truffle French fries are amazing. 

It's not a cheap meal, but you definitely get your bang for your buck kinda meal. If you're looking for something unique to Vegas and a memorable dining experience Bachi Burger has my vote for best burger joint in Vegas"}
{"text":"Usually come here twice a month for the good eats but my llast visit might have been my last. Day before thanksgiving we came for dinner. Everything was good until the next morning (turkey day) when my wife started throwing up, diarrhea and bed ridden the whole day. 100% sure it was the burgers"}
{"text":"We are repeat customers to this Bachi Burger and the one on Sahara. On this visit I had the Loco Moco with risotto and sweet bacon relish. Wow! That sounds good. And it did taste good, however, it was very salty."}
{"text":"About $10+ for a burger here. Add $5 for fries and $3 for a soda. Comes out a little pricey but the flavors are very unique. Kalbi burger was dripping with kalbi sauce, almost a little too much. Instead of lettuce, there was Kim chee in the burger. Calamari had a lemon grass sauce dip which was very good."}
{"text":"Not going to go to great lengths here but the burgers are okay. Beef is definitely higher quality than your average restaurant or steakhouse, and their creativity is admirable but two burgers with one order of fries should not come out to $40 with tip. Sorry guys but the high end burger joint is the answer to a question nobody is asking. Service was also just okay. Waited a few minutes for water, order was taken timely, but the food arrived about 10-15 minutes later. The restaurant was not packed. Just an okay burger with a high price tag. Not going back."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was very bad. Waitress made us wait to order and she couldn't figure out how to split the check 3 ways per group.   Oh.. and we asked for extra napkins and we only got 1..  omg! 
First time here..  but will probably go to the other location next time near the strip."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not many choices for vegetarians. Was given a veggie burger with a SOGGY patty HARD TOFU and too much Sweet sauce. Will never go back"}
{"text":"My sis was in town so we decided to come to bachi burger to have some dinner. The hostess who greeted us was very polite but our other party wasn't here yet and she had said that we needed to wait for the rest of the party before seating us! I thought omg what's the point if we could have have been seated and got our beverage order first. That was the only downfall.

I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the kiki's burger and the fries just tasted too salty. It was a good idea to have used oxtail because the meat is really tender and moist. The burger was the best thing. Nice and juicy on the inside and the flavors was all there.

My sis ordered the shoyu ramen and the taste profile is amazing perfect for a rainy day or if you have a cold. Overall, this place might need some work in customer seating but I would come back for the burgers."}
{"text":"Front of house makes you wait although get plenty tables, Mus b to make like really busy? 10 minute wait turned into 20 wit plenty open tables.  One hour after arrival we finally got out oxtail fries, was ok but look a whole lot better than tasted. Because we order appetizers we had to wait a whole lot longer for our burgers! Everyone around us who sat down after got their burgers first! Wow das how they take care us Hawaiians? Hey bro... Kanaka lives matter too! Any how got the bahmi burger, was small size patty wit big bun, neva look like the one I seen on tv. Burger was ono, but overall experience, I no goin came back, Aloha"}
{"text":"Decent food. Ronin Burger was awesome. Other things was just okay. The oxtail cheese fries was okay. Didn't meet my expectation. The lighting was good and the atmosphere was okay. Service was steady and pretty quick."}
{"text":"I might have had a better burger, but I don't remember when.  Best burger in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this after hearing good things. But nothing impressed me much, except the milkshake. 

FOOD:
Crusty Crab (3 stars): They should just offer this as a crab cake. Did not taste that great. Did not remind me of a burger at all and the ingredients just didn't mesh well together. Would have been better just as a crab cake alone. I wouldn't really recommend this. Pretty disappointed when I took my first bite )=

Salted Caramel Milkshake (4 stars): Strong yummy caramel flavor! Best thing I tried here. But it's so small!! I finished it so fast. And the marshmallow topping takes up some of the glass filling so you really don't get a whole glass worth. 

Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries (3 stars): The sauce it was with was okay. Maybe the truffle would have been better. Not very spicy at all.

SERVICE (3 stars):
Got our food and never saw the server again until we were done. He also told me the chili fries were good if you like spicy food. Um, was not even spicy at all, haha, maybe I just take spice better than he does.

Wasn't impressed by this place. My friends really liked the Oxtail Fries so maybe that's what it's all about. My milkshake was good but the Burger Bar milkshakes at Mandalay Bay were better."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE I JUST GOT FOOD POISONING!!!! 

I only had a lunch I made at home (and I just went grocery shopping so it was fresh) before I came here for dinner. I ordered the Wagyu Beef burger medium, with cheddar and avocado, my husband got the Mr.Miyagi-San burger, medium as well. When mine came out it looked really rare and I thought it might have been even raw in the center. I was going to send it back but my husband said it looked okay so I ate it. Low and behold a few hours later I'm puking my guts up. This all happened today 4/4/18. I looked up this business and they got shut down a few months ago for COCKROACHES INFESTATION AND BEING DIRTY. NEVER EVER COMING HERE AGAIN EVER."}
{"text":"An asian take on an american classic, Bachi Burger impresses.

Don't let the outside look of this place fool you, they make some pretty good food. The burgers were all cooked well and the asian twist behind everything was surprisingly amazing. Some of the burgers I tried were the Banh Mi, the Kalbi, and the Kiki. The Kalbi was by far my favorite out of the three, it has kimchi which was a great substitution to lettuce.We also ordered their oxtail chili cheese fries, the Bachi pickles, sweet potato fries and their salt and pepper garlic  french fries. The oxtail fries was the only thing that I wouldn't order again. Everything else was delicious, you have to try the salt and pepper garlic fries, I couldn't stop eating them.

Overall this place is worth the trip if you're a local. If your a tourist and want to venture into some of the local eateries this place will fulfill your need."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location for Bachi Burger.  The restaurant is usually not crowded and the food is consistently better than the other ones.  It is also more toned down and not as loud as the other ones.  My favorite burgers at Bachi are the Miyagi-San's, Banh Mi, and Kiki's.  All fries are good except for the truffle fries.  Skip the milkshakes because they are not tasty.  Service was good but could be improved upon with more staff."}
{"text":"Hey! watch out now.. cus the southwest is comin' up! Bachi Burger, MMMMM!
I would end the review there.. But Bachi deserves more than that. Seriously, forget the burger truck. Bachi can stay right where it is and I'll come to them anytime. I've only been here once. Thanks to Yelp, it has led me here. But with my stomach willing and all... I would come here every day.

I came here with three others being all Bachi virgins. So we ordered a different burger each. That way we can try eachothers. The inside is fairly spacious and simple. I ordered the Bahn-Mi burger. I'm not sure what Bahn-Mi means, but I'd assume it's a vietnamese sandwich except in burger form. I got to try the ox-tail chili fries and the parmesan truffle fries. Both are deservingly tasty, but I love the parmesan truffle more. They had taro boba but no hot taro milk tea =/. What was more important was that the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the oc tail fries and just like expected they were great. Seem to have some other good options are well but the fries are a must try."}
{"text":"Here were my observations:

* The servers acted like robots
* The servers were completely annoying and intrusive
* The food is far too rich
* The prices are completely unjustified
* The place is annoyingly loud
* The place feels cramped
* The concept is a \"joke\" 

Likelihood of returning?   2 to 3%."}
{"text":"I am a huge burger guy I love them. Asian style burger really caught my eye. This place is good the wait was a bit long but a interesting and good change."}
{"text":"Creative menu items, lots of choice on all the food and drinks... But the service is average at the absolute best. Two tables that arrived after my two top were attended to before we were. We were only served when I made a snide remark as a busser walked by and heard my irritation. Our server was very attentive until the food got to our table, then we had to ask for our check and sitting with our bare plates for a while. Good food for what will be my only visit."}
{"text":"Man... we were just looking for a cool place to relax off the strip. Get a decent burger and call it a night. 

Did we hit the jackpot! 

Oxtail chili??? Specialty Burgers?? Oxtail Chili cheese fries!!?? 

We had no idea at the time we were stumbling upon such an awesome place to eat dinner. Everything was right. The pricing, the food and the atmosphere. Highly recommended!!

Also- I think I saw this on Man vs. Food recently or Diners, Drive-ins and Dives... can't remember... these folks are doing real food and real good!"}
{"text":"I came to this location last night at approximately 6:30 pm. Approaching the host stand, a tall brown-haired host told us the wait would be about 45 minutes for a party of 2, which is fine, considering its a busy place on a Friday night. After about 10 minutes, we were trying to decide if we wanted to stay or go somewhere else so we decided to see if there would be a table sooner considering parties of 2 are the easiest to seat (I work in a busy, upscale Strip restaurant, as a host).  I told my boyfriend to go check with the host and we were treated with complete disrespect. The host said,\"Well, since you waited 10 minutes and I told you 45, that means that you have 35 minutes left. Do the math in your head.\" 


Wow, right?! 


If I said that to my guests, I would not have a job.

I also called the manager today and told him what had happened and he did not seem to care, at all. He just listened, then said \"thank you, have a nice day.\" 

Their burgers are good but not that great to be treated like that."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to burger joint for over 5 years.  I've seen a lot of change over the years.  Good thing is the food tastes the same for the most part (truffle fries have tasted different) but you never know what kind of service you're gonna get. My last 3 visits the service has been slow service will be and no one even tries to come around to apologize for the wait or fills your water as it gets low.  So I can say in the past I spent a lot more here but every time I come back another fave was taken off the menu (katstushiro an alcoholic beverage and the bread pudding with coffee ice cream, boba tea drinks as well) so I just order my faves that remain which is the miyagi San, which is delicious by the way.  I do recommend it and is why we come so often.  We also get the oxtail fries, it's a must.  Anyways back to the last visit, the host sat us before people that were there before us and they got so mad that they left before we could even tell the host.  Then once w
e got our order in the food took awhile but not only that, when it did come it was just our burgers.  By the time the fries came my husband was done with his burger and the rest of us waited for the fries so the burger was cold by then.  She was nice enough to comp the fries since they came so late which I  appreciate and I'll sure was not her fault but was not cool to have brought friends to the first time to experience this.  They may or may not ever want to go back on their own.  They did enjoy the burger though so they may try it again.  My point I'm trying to make is they need to tighten up on the service.  Not sure what's happening with management but there is new faces every time we come so we never get treated like regulars even though were always here.  Our visits are becoming less because of this."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and picking up my boss at the airport so was looking for a good lunch spot off of the strip.  I read some great reviews of Bachi Burger on Yelp so was excited to try it out.  I sat at the bar and it was easy because the wait for a table was a little bit.  My waiter was really friendly and gave a full explanation of the menu and his recommendations.  I ended up going with his favorite which was the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and the fries.  I loved the pineapple ketchup for the fries as I had never had that before.  The burger was delicious too.  It was massive and I didn't think I was going to finish it but I devoured it.

Unassuming spot in a strip mall but great burgers!"}
{"text":"Weekday for lunch, lots of empty tables and no wait whatsoever. Lots of parking as it is located, like so many other Vegas restaurants, in a strip mall.

I don't know how you can come here and not get the Shogun burger. I mean, it's a burger. With foie gras.  I don't understand the question. However, fair warning, the burger is pretty rich and I think if we hadn't gone halvsies with another burger that involved a taro bun which was interesting, I definitely wouldn't have been able to finish an entire Shogun burger by myself. We also ordered the oxtail chili fries which was huge and basically impossible to finish. After this super rich lunch, I was very happy but also just wanted to unbutton my pants and lie down for a few hours. 

Also they have a nice beer and sake menu."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the Food Network (DDD). I wanted to try the dishes that was featured on the show.
1. The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries was amazing, the best part was the fried egg on top
2. Kiki's Burger, cooked medium was so juicy
3. Pork Belly Steamed Buns, I was a lil disappointed. When I was watching the show Guy Fieri made the buns seem so yummy. There wasn't enough flavor for me.

The customer service is excellent, took about 5 minutes to seat us and about 10 minutes for the food to come out. I will definitely come back here whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thanks mucho to Careline V. an awesome friend and amazing Yelpie for recommending I try Bachi while I'm in LV. Place was packed although my friend and I were able to be seated straight away. Nice comfortable atmosphere with one TV. Place is clean and to my eyes looks pretty new. Somewhat hidden in an unassuming strip mall. Food is anything but. The flavors in the burger I had which was the Kiki smack you right in the face. So juicy and tender. Bun is very soft and warm. Although a good size did not feel stuffed or sluggish after I was done. Ordered a side of fries. Although I wanted to try the Ox tail which Jennifer C. mentioned to me. Next time ;-) To drink I got the Burton Baton by my favorite Brewery Dogfish Head. 

Service was excellent! A must stop off the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the serve and the yummy food.. We will come back here.. Thanks guys.."}
{"text":"First, as Southern California gal, I've had my share of vegas visits but I've only gone here three times and I think whenever I come to vegas, this place has to be a staple. Service is impeccable,  especially this last visit. 

There's nothing really more that needs to be said. Every visit comes with a wait but that just means that it's THAT good. Worth the wait and their cocktails are just good! Especially the katsu shiro! Can't wait for the next time I go, going to try another new burger."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bachi Burger in years, basically since it became hip and everyone wrote articles about it and the masses descended.   

The burgers I remember as being good but I make burgers at home so really don't go to burger joints in general.  I actually hadn't planned to go but the Izakaya in the same shopping center that was my plan turned out to be closed.  So I decided to go to Shoku Ramen only to discover it is now combined with Bachi.  Worked for me, there was a French fry dish I'd heard a lot about and I figured it would make an interesting combo with a bowl of Ramen.

I ordered the Tonkatsu Shio, which came out quickly and was very good. I actually prefer it to Monta's, even if the style (which is the same as Monta and everybody frikking else which is annoying) isn't the kind I prefer.  Sadly they did not have the oxtail fries on the menu or anything that looked like it so that was a miss.  Although, probably for the best because the Ramen filled me up.

I also ordered the Portuguese donuts, which do not come with a filling, but do come with ice cream. Both ice cream and donuts were good but not anything spectacular.

The place was very busy but the staff were responsive and friendly and somehow even managed to sneak in a staff photo while taking care of everything.

All in all, given how close it is for me, I might have to put it back on my radar as a place to go, especially since Shuseki closed taking with it the style of ramen I like."}
{"text":"The oxtail fries that everyone says are soooo amazing are basic ass chili cheese fries with beans. The chili isn't even that good."}
{"text":"Wagyu Burger is phenomenal.  Plantation style iced tea is the best!"}
{"text":"The Wagyu Burger is delicious and I order it every time 5/5.  The Plantation Style Iced Tea w/ pineapple juice and mint is excellent 5/5.  The service on multiple occasions has lacked so that's why 3 stars for this Bachi Burger location."}
{"text":"Love love loved it!!!!

When I found out we were going to Vegas I KNEW this was the first place I'd hit up... Yes we are DDD groupies and we were not deceived!!!!!!!

We arrived around 1pm on a Thursday - there wasn't a wait!!!!!

Our server was so hospitable - he was polite, attentive, and really seemed to enjoy his job... his cheerfulness actually made me a little happier... He gave us recommendations (even though Guy Fieri already showed me (Kalbi) what I was getting, my BF took the server up on his recommendation (Miyagi San) and wasn't disappointed)!

Like the true fat asses we are, we started with the oxtail chili cheese fries with extra chili aioli on the side - SOOOOO GOOD... The runny egg yolk dispersing over the tender meat, jalapeños, and crispy fries... #heaven!
Our burgers were cooked perfectly - medium well, as requested!
I love all Asian food - Asian anything makes me happpppppy... so my Kalbi marinated burger with kimchi, HIT THE SPOT... I could eat it weekly and not get sick of it!!!

We finished off with the Portuguese donuts - I wasn't impressed... Mainly Bcuz the donuts were raw on the inside... but I was too stuffed to complain.

Overall this was a great experience (sans donuts)..."}
{"text":"I've only been there once and it was so good and original.  I got a burger that was pretty spicy but not slap you're mom spicy.  The thing i noticed about the burger was how juicy and tender it was, the best piece of hamburger patty i've eaten. EVER!!!

The assortment of fries were delicious, try them all. I liked their special sauce with them. 

The one negative is the crowdedness and smallness of the joint.  They need to find a larger restaurant, it is so popular that you have to wait a long time and then you feel cramped sitting so close to strangers.  which could be a good thing if the strangers are attractive and don't have BO, but lets face it, most people have BO and i don't like to smell it in a restauarant, unless it's my own of course, my smell doesn't offend me. 

Get a bigger restaurant, you're business will grow faster and you'll make more money, it is too popular to have a tiny, rinky dink area."}
{"text":"I just had my Father's Day with my daughter at Bachi Burger.  Wow, that was the best burger I have ever had. My daughter had seen Bachi Burger on one of her favorite shows, \"Drive Inns, Diners, and Dives, and had eaten there before. She was right it was amazing!  We went all out getting the calamari appetizer- very nice, the Duck Bun Rolls yummy, and I had burger that has the same last name as the instructor in the Karate Kid, crazy good!  My daughter had the burger that was a ground combo of high end beef, pork, and shrimp- also a hit. 

Our waiter was great, and the only reason I did not give it five stars is it is not cheap. This definitely isn't your Carl's Jr. $6 Burger.  But for a special treat, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"If it's not broke.. Don't fix it.

I have been to Bachi multiple times.. And this last time, well it's my LAST. My server was incredibly robotic and has zero personality. Way to create an experience! 

We ordered our burgers and fries... The fries were pathetic, and that's my favorite part about this place, how sad. The burgers.. Still good but not a kick in your mouth of flavor. This place has changed and gone downhill.. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"This is what happen to me after have spicy miso soup. And my husband call them to tell the manage that something wrong with the soup so if the other people come they make sure people don't get sick..."}
{"text":"After all the rave that I've been hearing about this place, it was really good! Ordered the konin burger w/ garlic fries; not a big fan with the type of buns they used but this time it worked really well. Oh deng the sauce that went along with the burger was BOMB. Same with the garlic fries. Staffs are friendly and very prompt; they need to tone it down a bit though, we felt like we were being rushed. I wanted to enjoy my meal with my company. Overall it's a must try and I'll be back forshure..."}
{"text":"For starters, I wish I could rate my experience below 1 star .. And for anyone in shock about this, ask yourself, if this restaurant wasn't associated with the \"Bachi\" name, would you really rate your overall experience as high as you did? This was my 2nd time here and both visits were for brunch. The food is good but the service is slow and painful .. The first time, our food took 35 minutes.. This time it was 50 minutes before the orders came out .. correct. Let me explain... The restaurant was open an hour by the time we arrived and there were no customers. This should tell you service should be quick as well as cooking time since the grill should be wide open. After ordering, it was 15 minutes before our waitress told us they were out of the short ribs for my short rib loco moco. I was calm about it and asked for the wagyu patty cooked medium. My fiancé ordered an omelet with roasted tomatoes.. 20 minutes later, he was told they were out of roasted tomatoes? When we said, \"Omg ..\" The waitress said \"hey, I don't do the ordering.. Don't shoot the messenger.\" By the way, there were 3 of us and by this time, my sis already had her food which was the salmon latke (latke is a potato pancake - looks like a really flat hash brown). The omelet followed .. And it was missing the hash browns. Why this wasn't made at the same time the latke was, we'll never know. Fiancé told the waitress it was missing and she said she'll bring it right out. Before this happened, my loco came out. The patty which now was at 37 minutes in, was completely raw on the inside! We all asked waitress to have them cook it longer and also put the omelet under the heat lamp before that gets cold since STILL no sign of hash browns .. Waitress said 2 minutes more .. Salmon latke still waiting .. If it wasn't a fairly cold dish to start, it would have been. By this time, the couple who arrived 20 minutes after us, are eating their burgers and fries and another couple had arrived. In total, there were 7 diners in the entire place and we were STILL waiting.  Finally, the fiancé said he was hungry and the experience was ridiculous and suggested we leave.  I was so upset because I've always enjoyed Bachi Burger and thought my sis visiting from Hawaii would love it. Instead, we were all so disappointed by the service and nonchalant attitude of the server AND the manager!! We got up to leave and the server rushed over with our plates; 1 in each hand and said, \"but we are going to heavily discount your meal...\" At this time the manager was near the door and looked at all of us, and then walked outside??? Then, he walked back in, but NEVER came over to ask what the problem was.. He didn't even walk near us. He walked to the back of the restaurant and didn't come out again. P.S., the manager I am referring to is Joseph J., who claims to be a foodie that absolutely loves the smile he can put on people's faces after delivering exceptional food and service!  By the way, it is also his \"passion to exceed your expectations in every way.\" Well, it must be your expectations because he batted 0 for 3 with us. It was like he consciously ran from the situation and had this horrible server make the situation worse. I actually remembered her from the last time, but she wasn't my server then .. We did ask her for something .. Again, the place was pretty dead .. I would estimate 8 people at the most.. We wanted to add to our order and our waitress wasn't to be seen ... So, we asked her and she said, \"well, I'm actually on my break..\" We could not believe she told us that when the restaurant was only open for 2 hours .. Why would you even take a break during peak brunch hours? While writing this, I still can't believe the manager and how he avoided the whole situation.. In any case, we left and won't be back. I am sad about this because as mentioned, I do like Bachi's food but 2 occasions now.. Same to worse service and experience.. 3rd time would just be shame on me..."}
{"text":"We love burgers! Saw this restaurant on Triple D. 

We came here twice when we were in Vegas and ordered the following:

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (sweet flavor and good amount of chili cheese!)
Kiki Burger (filled with umami flavor!)
Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (just like the name and tasted great!)

If you love burgers, and want to eat something different, get away from the strip and drive to Bachi! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty burgers. But if you don't have a car and need to drive from the strip, I dunno if it's worth the cab ride.

All the burgers were pretty good. Had the spicy miso burger which was rich and good."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Bachi! Surprisingly enough it took a tourist to summon me to come here. He kept blabbing on about seeing Bachi on the food channel and wanted to order what was on tv. Let me just say this place doesn't disappoint. 

Oxtail chili cheese fries!!! A serious must have! There's slices of jalapeños and egg yolk in the mix too. It's messy, but a great kind of messy. 

We also had some kind of soft steamed dough pork belly slider. Hm... The dough had a weird sweetness to it. My least favorite item. 

They are know for burgers (obviously) so we ordered two and cut them in half so we could try both. We had the Miyagi-San and the Kiki burger. Both delicious in their own way, but Miyagi-San was AMAZING! We washed all this down with the plantation style sweet tea with pineapple and mint!"}
{"text":"My experience was not positive the last visit. Ordered one of my favorite burgers and had to spit it out - yuck!  Asked for the manager, Mike, who unwilling to accept the fact that I got a product that was not good. He was arrogant, unwilling to replace the burger or do anything to make the customer \"happy\".  I will not return, nor will the guests that were with me."}
{"text":"Wow, Bachi Burger does everything right. Asian fusion meets the bun and holy shit does it ever fucking work. My only gripe? Bachi Burger needs a location in LA! Seriously, this place puts all the other burger joints to shame. I mean, this is what Umami Burger should be doing. 

Bachi Burger is located 5 miles to the southeast of the Strip in a non-descript shopping center. Being the noObs that we were, the wife and I could not figure out which side the entrance was located at (it's on the north side by the way). Once we entered we were lucky enough to be seated because this place was fucking packed. 

After perusing Yelp reviews, we decided to order the famous oxtail chili cheese fries. All I have to say is thank you Yelp for recommending the oxtail chili cheese fries because they were amazing. The chef is Japanese Hawaiian and the minute you see the fries you will see the Hawaiian influence because there was a perfectly cooked fried egg on top! The portion of the fries was huge. As an appetizer, it could easily be shared with 4 people. Aside from the egg and fries, it consisted of tender oxtail meat, cheese, scallions, jalapenos, sriracha mayo, garlic aioli, chili, and beans. I mean the combination of these ingredients was simply bliss. My wife and I hardly spoke because we were devouring the mountain of fries like fucking barbarians. 

As for the burgers, my wife had the Kiki Burger and I had the Miyagi Burger. The Kiki Burger was really something. Thick and juicy Angus beef, three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese, and a sriracha-mayo sauce... oh heaven! As for my Miyagi Burger, it consisted of thick and juicy wagyu meat with furikake (nori flakes), caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, fried egg and mayo. It was good... a little on the sweet side... let' just say that I liked my wife's burger a little better. Also, if you aren't into fusion burgers, they have a regular Angus burger that you can customize. 

So, we were unable to finish our meal. Too much fucking food. I can't remember the last time I went to a gourmet burger joint and was unable to finish my burger. I think my only suggestion for Bachi Burger is that they should offer a sampler platter because they have so many unique burgers and it was a shame that I couldn't try more. 

Bachi, I fucking heart you. 

*One thing my wife and I noticed was that  a requisite to work here is that you need to be Asian with arm tattoos. But don't let the tats scare you because the servers are super sweet like ramune."}
{"text":"Good Burgers! Just wish the A/C was working!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.... We really loved this place.  The burgers were fantastic.  We ordered various burgers and all were spot on.  From the Kiki's Burger to the Chicken/Turkey burger, all were yummy.  The fries were big enough to share and were done just how I like them, crispy but not too crunchy.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they showed 5 or 6 different beers both on the menu and a chalkboard on the wall, but disappointingly only had 1 type on tap.  No reason was given to us as to why.  A variety of drinks from wine to beer were available.  Service was nice and quick.  Well worth the trip away from The Strip in Vegas.  Will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! Hands down, the tastiest and sumptuous treat for anyone who is looking for a unique and palatable concoction of an out-of-this world burger!"}
{"text":"If I'm judging purely on value, it's a zero star.  The place is just super expensive, and you're paying for faux ambiance instead of quality.  

Ask yourself - why am I going to this restaurant?

If your answer is food, try Smashburger.  If your answer is that you want sake-infused hockey pucks of beef, then sit down and enjoy your overpriced Grade D meat."}
{"text":"My brother in law took us there for the first time in November! I always wanted to try this place since I saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! I didn't get to try their famous chili cheese fries, however their burgers are huge and was heaven!  We been back once since then but I still have to go back to try their fries! One of my top burger places!"}
{"text":"Way Overrated and way Overpriced!!! I came here a month ago specifically to try the foie gras. Placed the order and after waiting about 10 minutes they came back stating they were out. This is just poor management! Then it took them 30 minutes to bring out our food. It was obvious they were more focused on their regulars because they got their food first yet we arrived at least 15 minutes before them. Finally, the food was not that great, kid's burgers were hard and overcooked. Cooking burgers is what they should know how to do correctly yet they sent it out for my kids to eat. I guess they assume since it's a kids meal the kids won't know any better. In all I spent $75 for burgers that's were not good! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Bachi has a very trendy vibe and asian fusion burgers.

Plus:
- the size of the patties on their burger.
-medium rare was really medium rare (they must have quality beef here)
-sweet potatoe fries, crispy on the outside, smooth and soft inside

Minus
-does everything need a fried egg on top?
-oxtail fries, you couldnt tell it was oxtail, cant really tell if there's meat in it at all. this too had a fried egg on top."}
{"text":"So we double dated at Bachi Burger and the first thing we notice is that smell! It smelled so good!

Like my intro?  The 4 of us were all Bachi virgins and our cherries were about to get popped like goes the weasel!  All of us agreed to get a different burger each and a different specialty drink.  I ordered the Kalbi Burger which I thought was the biggity bomb!  It had kim-chee inside! It came with a side of Kim-chee style mini zucchini/cucumber, wasn't too sure what it was but it was tasty, and went well with my burger.  The drink i had was the strawberry lemonade jasmine tea (no free refills). It was really pulpy so if you order it, make sure you get a glass of water too to wash it all down.  And I can't forget the ox-tail chili cheese fries... Mmm! I just wish they put more ox-tail.

The overall experience at Bachi was a memorable one.  Service was fast, music was good, environment was comfortable, and the food was Uh-maze-zing!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food!  Everything awesome!  My fave is Miyagi San burger and Chicken Wings!  Great service, burgers cooked perfectly. Cucumber kimchi delicious!  We always order extra!  Fri and Sat night gets crowded and you might have to wait but its worth it!  Ramen is also available and it is also excellent!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I guess I didn't learn from my last experience dealing with a place that was featured on a TV Show. Not My Choice but here we go. 
Service was Slow, Chalk it up to a Big Crowd. We ordered Calamari to Start. $12. Smallest order of Fried Calamari I have ever received at a restaurant. Not Cripsy, Dipping Sauces were OK. Garlic Truffle Fries, About the same. Expensive and Received almost a Small order from McDonalds. Meh...... Burger was a Ronin. Tasted like a Burger from Denny's with Grape Jelly. No, There wasn't grape jelly but the sautéed Onions tasted just like it. My Biggest Problem was that I was Still Hungry. After spending $78.00 at a Burger Placeyou would think you would be stuffed. I just Felt Ripped Off. Even at Normal Burger Rates I would give this place a NO. 
Thanks Man vs Food, Me Thinks Not.  knew we should have gone to Parma."}
{"text":"Great burger place off the strip. I got the Banh-mi burger and ox-tail chili cheese fries.

Both were delicious and will definately make the trip out here again.  You must make the trip out here if you go to vegas."}
{"text":"I cannot wait for them to open their West LA location!  This place was amazing!

The Strawberry Lemonade was awesome and perfect on such a hot day. We loved our Salt and Pepper French Fries.  My burger, the Kalbi was amazing - I love the kalbi marinade and kimchi on a perfectly cooked burger with a soft bun. It was awesome and was promptly devoured.  Mr R ordered the Bahn Mi burger and loved it as well.

I was a bit nervous about the service and the wait as I have seen other Yelpers who weren't so happy with the service - but we were very happy with BJ who took care of us and everyone else. There were always lots of employees (and management) around serving food, clearing plates, making sure everyone had what they needed.

Hopefully I won't have to wait for my next Vegas trip to have a Bachi Burger and the West LA one will open soon!"}
{"text":"This place really seems hit or miss on both the service and the food. On the most recent visit, we were the only ones there for breakfast. We were off to a shaky start, as we were not given the breakfast menu and had to notify the staff. Once we were given the menu, we were immediately asked if we were ready to order. Hmm, not yet because we just got the menu! Coffee was not even hot, food was not hot (almost like it had been sitting for a while before it was served), and the waiter never came to check up on us until the end. After seven visits to this location, I can honestly say that this will be the last."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of burgers but good thing they have a fish burger. The price is pretty pricey. About 15 bucks which includes fries and drink. Dam that's a lot. Not only the burger, drinks, and fries are pricey but the wait is long. It took an hour for us to get our food. If you read the reviews, the wait is pretty long. I think the owner came and asked how we were doing and we asked how long does it take to make the burger. He said 12 mins.  Hmmmmm.... Why did it take an hour?? Anyways, the fish burger I got was really good. I really liked the fried too. I would definitely come back to this place if I'm in town."}
{"text":"Made is to Bachi Burger after reading rave reviews....omg. yum.

I tried:
The Ronin-Fave! It is soo incredibly good, I wish I got more then just a bite of it, I might order it next time I go...

The Kiki- It was also really good, I would order it again.

The Lonely Bird- This one was just \"eh\" to me, compared to the other burgers. I probably wont ever order it for myself, but recommend it to those who enjoy turker/chicken burgers...

That's Cheesy- This was REALLY good, for a grilled cheese. I'm not quite sure I'd order it again though.

The bachi pickles were also really interesting, I ordered some and no one at the table really liked them. I gave them all a try and thought they were some interesting flavors and textures...it was worth the try, but wouldn't try it again.

the FRIES:
Truffle parm: YES, Yes, YES. So good, I almost ordered another order...but we really didn't need anymore food.

The garlic salt and pepper: these were also nummy! But I suggest the truffle parm over them!

When we were done eating I ordered the Pop tart, but they didn't have any...so I ordered macadamia nut toffee cake...it wasn't bad...but I wasn't impressed with it. We also ordered a strawberry smoothie, which I felt tasted a little off.

Go and Enjoy it! It was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Been there multiple times just never left a review until now. If you go there you have to try the miso burger and oxtail fries.  Staff is very friendly. Sometimes has a 15-20 minute wait but staff does their best to get you seated."}
{"text":"While in town for NYE, a local friend brought me here for my first visit.  I'm awaiting their opening here in my hometown back in Southern California.  Yes the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries are awesome.  We also shared the Miyagi-San Burger and another that I cannot recall. One had a sweet purple taro bun and chinese sausage .  Busy place but they were quick to get us seated and served.  Everything was delicious and even with our appetites going big that night I still had some leftovers that hit the spot after a late night.  Best wishes to this company, I'm sure you have much more in store."}
{"text":"Salted caramel shake
Truffle fries 
Miyagi burger 
Takoyaki
Effin amazing this place is ... I dream about their milkshakes and drool over their burgers"}
{"text":"It's f***ing awesome the buffalo chilli fries are a must, the burgers are so good and even the cocktails and homemade soda are incredible"}
{"text":"I was here the same time as Yami. Took 20 minutes for a server to come to the table, then another 40+ minutes before the cook came out to tell me the red bean burger that I ordered (and was the reason I chose Bachi tonight) wasn't available. She was very sweet and offered to make another vegetarian option not on the menu (loved it). The server said they'd had a big to-go order of 17 burgers and there were three other tables, all six to eight tops in the dining room, which was clearly too much for the inadequate number of staff. I counted one server, seemingly newer because the poor kid seemed nervous, and one bar tender. Three working in the kitchen. Eventually another server showed up, but I think by that point the damage was done. I never saw anyone acting as a manager. One table called the cook out to the dining room and chewed her out for several minutes, which resulted in a big fight in the kitchen. My husband and I have both worked years in the restaurant business, so we were patient and the food was definitely worth it. I think it was just a really crappy night for them, and I felt awful for everyone. I hope the manager gets things sorted out and adequately staffs the place in the future because the location is great for us and we love the food."}
{"text":"Great quality hamburgers,  I love the chicken/turkey burger it's really good, their fries are delicious specially the ones with porcini sauce. Only thing is if you have a group of 4 or more the wait can be"}
{"text":"my first visit to bachi was far from pleasant. I arrived just after opening on a Saturday. there were about five guest in the lobby, some eating and some awaiting service. behind the bar/line I counted six employees, one of which was the bar tender who was on the phone taking a call-in order. he made eye contact with me three times and still said nothing. shortly after, (and at the point that I was ready to leave) I was seated. I ordered the shotgun burger and a coke, which came quickly. 

during my meal I saw several employees chatting and playing on their phones in view of customers. the food is good but the customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"This is my usual pit stop while in Vegas. Found this gem about three years ago. Every time I've gone in, it has been top notch. Never one bad experience. Best burger spot in Vegas hands down, can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Las Vegas! The Miyagi Burger and Truffle Fries are a must! The customer service is always great.  There sometimes a wait... but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I wish restaurant reviews would solely be based off of the food itself.  Unfortunately,  customer service quality always overcomes the taste of the food no matter how you look at it. 

The exact same goes for this place.  Drove off the strip with the gf and her siblings hoping to have a positive experience.  Another couple entered right before us.  Then,  we were seated shortly after. The 4 of us ordered a total of 3 burgers (fries too but that's besides the point).  It must have take them literally 30 minutes for our orders to come out even after asking our server about  the status.  By this time,  there have already been other customers who have come in after us and left before we even got our food.  Is this acceptable?  Certainly not.  Their excuse was that because we requested one of our burgers to be cooked 'well'  instead of 'medium',  that it would delay it.  Really though,  what's the time frame difference between the two?  I'm no chef but I don't think it's 20 minutes.  

Anyway,  we finally got our food and honestly,  it tasted good but because of our long wait,  I feel it's fair to give them a 2 star. We almost walked out due to the long wait time.  

Although the server apologized and offered a discount,  it does not make up for the experience we had.  Will not return to this location.."}
{"text":"So good!! Me and a group of friends ordered the truffle fries (had gravy on top), ramen bowls and burgers. 

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen ($10) and the broth was so tastey I didn't even want to add any seasoning. The ramen was really soft and fresh. Loved that the yolk in the egg was still oozing showed the freshness of the egg as well. Two pieces of pork in the soul and it was good but it was all fat.

Also ordered a burger ($15) (forgot the name) but it had onion rings and a sunny side egg in it an it was delicious! The patty is so soft and full of flavor.

The waitress forgot our oxtail fries but that's okay because we were stuffed. 

Giant burgers can definitely share between two people with an appetizer. They don't skimp on the ramen bowl either!

Good portion, good price, tastey food!"}
{"text":"First of all, I was really expecting to get knocked off of my sox by the food, unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed in the flavor of my burger and my truffle French fries.  Our server was a nice young man, however, he was very inexperienced. Our food did not come out at the same time, it kind of trickled out one by one, there were 6 of us at the table. The worst part of this and I am not trying to be vulgar or grotesque, it has been 3 hours since I have eaten and I have had the runs and a stomach ache for over an hour now, something is not right. I don't think that I will return again."}
{"text":"If this review is simply about the burger then it's simply 5 stars. No question is that one of the best burgers I've ever had. I didn't know what to expect but everything about it was perfect and fantastic. I asked for medium rare- they nailed it. I wanted juicy- I got it. I wanted good- I got fantastic. 

I ordered the ronin burger: Ronin Burger, which is Angus Beef, Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli (and a sweet Hawaiian style bun). Weird? Maybe. Does it matter? No. It was awesome. Did I say that already? 

It's possible that I just nailed the perfect menu item. Seeing other reviews I would guess not really. 

We did have the parmesan fries- I could have done without. At least 7 beers listed on the menu were out of stock. That was a bit disappointing. And in terms of atmosphere, it's nothing special. It's great if you're getting a burger but not so much if you're looking for a nice night out. I would definitely come back here regardless of my intentions for the night! ;) And maybe the beer will be re-stocked by then!"}
{"text":"This is not an average place, but the food was underwhelming. Great menu, including ramen. But execution not so much. And when the food is not up to par with price I'm stilled annoyed the next morning. 

The $4 fresh squeezed lemonade nothing special, pass.

The pork belly buns, pork fat was not rendered well, left 2 behind. Bbq sauce served on the side is good but not needed. Not executed well.

The ox tail chili fries - hyped up wayyyyy too much. All the components are great individually but not balanced combined the way they were. Loved the fries and chili aioli but the oxtail chili was too all over the place. It needs some acid, smaller serving and a major price drop. $10+ bucks for that will piss people off. Also have you thought of a cilantro jalapeño aioli to go with the chili aioli OMG. That chili aioli is major. 

Miyagi burger, too much going on as well. The patty with just the bun would be an all star burger. The onion rings were all star. I wanted a side of onion rings after eating what was in the burger. The candied bacon I see the concept but it's out of place and hijacks the flavor from everything else. But this burger needs some acid, some freshness. You got bread, burger patty, egg, bacon and onion rings. A tomato perhaps? Thin slices of fresh pickled daikon, something ...

We came because of diners and dives, it's one of the places you want to give another try ... but not trying to throw more good money after wasted money."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing it on DDD. The service was very slow but friendly. We came for a late lunch. My husband and I split the Ronin burger which was pretty good, and the pork belly stemmed buns which were just ok. The truffle fries were good too.  Overall we were underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The food was really good. It was unlike anything we've ever had, but the service wasn't very good. Our appetizer took forever to come. My husbands burger came five minutes after the appetizer and my burger came ten minutes after his. As I sat there I noticed the same thing at all the other tables, parties of four or five would get their food in like ten minute intervals apart. I don't want to watch someone else eat for ten minutes or have them wait for my food and eat a cold burger."}
{"text":"Love the passion fruit boba and the sweet potato fries were crispy deliciousness! I didn't like the mustard sauce that came with it so much but they were yummy just plain. My shogun burger was disappointing because the patty was overcooked but the foie gras slab was generous and delicious. They offered to redo my burger but I didn't want them to have to redo a $25 burger so I declined. Later, since I couldn't eat the meat, I wish I had taken them up on their offer. Service is kind of spotty but the facility itself is hip and clean. Worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bahn mi burger and oxtail chili fries. Both were excellent. This restraint offers very unique flavorful menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I definitely don't get the hype that surrounds it- there are 1/2 dozen or more places on the strip that are substantially better. Many reviewers go here frequently it looks like- I have only been twice but based on those visits I won't be returning. 

Everyone raves about the Oxtail cheese fries- but the ones I ordered were essentially mush. The cheese was extremely greasy- something I would usually be all for- but they lacked any clear flavor and the fries disintegrated if you tried to pick them up. I consider myself a bit of a cheese fry connoisseur- I didn't attend 7 years of cheese fry medical school to be called Mr.- so this really hurt the rating for me. The addition of cheese to fries is a sacred act in my religion and must be treated with respect. 

Truffle fries- these were much better.


I have had two burgers there-the spicy miso and the Ronin. Both came a tad overcooked (grey throughout when ordered medium rare). The flavor wasn't that strong - I don't know a better way to put it- the burger just tasted weak. 

Service- as other reviewers have mentioned at least the Summerlin location is not very busy/it is easy to get a table. However, despite not being full the service was not very attentive. The meals probably took an extra 30-45 minutes due to slow ordering/check bringing etc."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bachi in years and was looking forward to it because I remember loving their amazing salt and pepper fries... we had a 7:30 reservation, upon arrival we noticed the table was still a mess and it took them a good 15 minutes to get it together and cleaned. It wasn't busy at all, if it had been busy I would've been more understanding. We finally sit out butts down and order our food.. our food took almost an hour to be served and everything that arrived was salty except the fries which lacked any form of seasoning.. our drinks were never refilled. I don't think I'll be coming back here. Ever. Our server was nice, but she failed to do her job correctly."}
{"text":"Great burgers and drinks. I've had four or five different burgers and they're all amazing. This is a newer location so it's not as busy as the others. 

Service is always friendly and good always fresh. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Crazy creative. Food was very unique in a good way. I can't wait to try more food."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for a table, it seems like it's always rammed.

We went between 2 and 3 pm and were told it would be about 45 mins to an hour wait. It ended up being closer to 30 minutes. The hostess was really unfriendly, but the waitress we had was great.

We tried the oxtail fries which I liked. Everything on the menu is very unique.

The burgers I saw coming out while waiting all looked really \"pretty\" and the meat patties looked tasty. I ordered the $25 shogun burger, with eel and foie gras on it. It wasn't incredible, but it was definitely interesting and new to me and I enjoyed it. My friends ordered the ronin burger and the lonely bird burger and they both loved it. 

I like how the menu has such unusual burgers and I'd like to try more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Came back again and tried chili fried chicken. It's made with a mix of chili, ginger, garlic and soy sauce, and tastes exactly like what you'd get if you mixed all those together. I think it was ok, the dipping sauce had a unique flavor.

Also had the sweet potato fries, which I think came with the same or similar sauce as the chili chicken did. The fries were cooked well, but tasted pretty much the same as sweet potato fries anywhere else.

Had the ronin burger this time, which had a very similar dark sauce flavor that the shogun burger had. I think i'd prefer the ronin over the shogun just because the shogun is a mix of such unusual flavors, and the ronin is closer to a regular burger."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this a burger place.  Even though there is a generous portion of hamburger meat placed between a nice soft bread bun, this doesn't taste anything like a burger.  Lol.  It's delicious, though!

I really liked my Miyagi-san burger.  Husband got the Ronin, but I didn't think it was as good as mine.  Oxtail chili-cheese fries with the fried egg were good.  I wouldn't NEED to eat those again, though.  Salted caramel shake tasted a bit like a caramel frap.  

5 stars for the Miyagi-san.  The rest of what we ordered would be 3 or 4 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little bit small so do expect a bit of a wait.
For our group of 5, we waited about 40mins or so.

They have a very appealing menu with lots of unique ingredients in their food, which is what I like.

Our server was on point. He always made sure we had waters and clearing our table of finished dishes.

Truffle Fries $5
These fries were good but not the best i've had. We couldn't really taste the truffle all that much, but it was cool because it was also topped with truffle sauce and extra dipping spicy garlic sauce on the side.

Oxtail Chili Fries $11
These fries were good as well. It was a very large portion and was the perfect sharing size for my group. The chili was a bit too sweet for my taste though. And I wasn't exactly sure how much oxtail was in there because it was super mixed up. Probably like tiny skinny shreds of oxtail. But I would still recommend it.

Miyagi San Burger $15
I got my burger cooked medium rare and it was perfect. Pink on the inside and brown on the outside. Overall the burger was simple but delicious.

Plantation Style Iced Tea $4
A bit pricey for tea but it was well worth it!!!! Delicious pineapple tasting tea. Must try!!


I found out after my meal that they had taro buns!!! Definitely getting that next time!

Overall it was good and i would still love to come back and try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"The food is like no other ! Throughout all my dinning experiences I can say i have never had such an amazing burger and oxtail fries ! Customer service is good and they are very attentive . Definitely worth checking out for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new burger joint. We decide to check it out bachi burger that everyone is talking about. 
 The oxtail cheese fries sounded different which they were but in a very good way. I'm sorry I forgot the name of the two burger that we tried but the ones we tried were awesome. We ordered a grill cheese for my daughter and she loved it so I tried it and it was really good too.  I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"I get it. I know, I'm a vegan going to a burger joint. But...if there's a meatless burger on the menu- it needs to be tasty. It wasn't. It was big enough, but not good enough. My friends ordered the Bachi burger, and the Kiki burger and they both liked it. But ...vegetarians beware. 
The service was fine. The place was clean. And the music was too loud."}
{"text":"Best burger in town, must try the Miyagi burger.  Delicious meat with crunchy onion rings and bacon within."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here. I've always had top notch food here every time I visit. I wish it was a little cheaper and the wait was a little shorter. Besides that, the best of the best right here."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! 
Started out with the oxtail chili fries - LOVED the egg and peppers and oxtail!! Fries were the thin cut that I prefer. Halfway through the fries I had to beg the waitress to take it away before I ate everything (had to save some stomach room for the burgers!)! 
I ordered the foie gras burger... to die for! It was SO rich, fat was dripping down the patty. I could not finish the burger (on account of the fries) but I would definitely come back and do it all over again!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about but they make good burgers. It's a bit expensive though the décor is nice."}
{"text":"Started with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries which were excellent.   Moved on to the Shogun Burger - great concept and loved the Unagi and foie gras combo.  Only problem is they overcooked the actual burger.   Maybe forgivable at $6 but you lose a star at $26."}
{"text":"Awesome burger place!!!! Had to check it out since all my friends said it was the bomb and OMG even my G/F was like its the best burger place she has eaten at. We ordered the chili fried chicken and it was surprisingly light for being fried. Sarah, ordered the ronin burger and i ordered the manga burger see pics. Also order honeydew boba which they make their boba from scratch. Can't wait to come back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I went here with my boyfriend for our first time and we just loved it here!"}
{"text":"Bachi was like other upscale burger joints. I was disappointed in the flavor of my burger because I upgraded to the wagyu and was not impressed.  All in all, presentation was on point and the fries were solid."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3-6, wish I would've known!"}
{"text":"BACHI LITERALLY MEANS BAD LUCK IN JAPANESE !!!

Thats exactly what we got when we came here! BAD STINKY LUCK! Thats the last thing you want in Vegas! Why would you name your restaurant \"BAD LUCK BURGER\" what the hell, we eating bad luck for lunch?? hell NAW!!! thats bad for your body thats bad luck i want good luck all the time!! We were greeted by a grumpy old white man at the front and he sat us down and grumbled and mumbled some words under his stinky breath, I could smell the air comin out of his mouth hole, it was like cigarettes combined with a jar of pee pee left in the sun for 3 days! oo man oo man bam it made me so hungry! I think some of his dandruff fell into my water cause i looked into my glass and it looked like a snow-globe in there! it was very cute but i dont wanna drink old white dry skin flakes! thats nasty basty! everytime he walk by he would be talking to himself, i do that too, i usually say inspirational quotes to myself to get my mind through the day cause lately i been feeling depressed and down and i dont like it. so i recorded him with my android robot 4 phone and used the CSI voice analyzer app to hear what he was saying. turns out he was just saying the lyrics to the Jug Jug song by Jimmy Crabbits. i was let down yet again by this man. I ordered the fish burger and some garlic fries, the waitress then said well we dont have anymore garlic for the fries so ill just bring it out without the garlic, i was like HMM OK maybe shell discount us cause the MAIN INGREDIENT of the dish is not there, NOPE STILL FULL PRICE, BAD LUCK AGAIN AT BAD LUCK BURGER. while i waited for the food i went to the toilet, BAD LUCK AGAIN THE MANS TOILET WAS BROKE SO I GOTTA USE THE WOMAN TOILET NOW. i went in the woman toilet and dropped off a little brown bean child into the swimming pool and flushed it down the whirlpool. when i come out 3 women in line just looked at me like i was creepy AZIZ ANSORRY! BAD LUCK AGAIN, IM A OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THE BAD LUCK BURGER CLUB. i came back to my seat and my food was there, i ate it up and the burger was tasty! and the fries was like dry twigs you could make a campfire with by rubbing em together like tom hank in castaway! damn i love castaway! remember wilson?? i hope hes ok just floating in the ocean like that. when i was leaving i stubbed my big toe against the big toe of the old white man, he dropped 3 beers he was holding, another waitress slipped on the beer, slid across the restaurant floor like tom cruise in his undies and crashed into a family holding hands and saying their prayers before the meal !!! BAD. LUCK. BURGER."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus Bachi Burger has ruined every single burger for the rest of my life. No other burger can compare to the overall yumminess of a Bachi Burger.

So far i've in one way or another have tried the:
Spicy Miso
Mr Miyagi 
Ronin 
Kalbi 

Each and every burger has it's own unique savoriness and bite. It's hard to pick a sure winner since they're all amazing. 

The oxtail chili fries...also amazing.

Look i'm not gonna go into a lot of detail seeing as so many have already beaten me to it. If you havent been here yet GO. if you need someone to go with make a UYE and they will come."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has been one of my favorites in Las Vegas since I discovered them on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I'm sad to say that the quality has gone way down since my last visit a year ago.

On my visit yesterday, I ordered my usual: Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns and a Banh Mi Burger. 

My first hint that something was off was when the waitress insisted that I order the Banh Mi Burger cooked medium, because it contains pork. In the past, I was always told by the server that medium rare was best - and safe because \"we know where our pork comes from, and it's safe.\"

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were tough and chewy. Very disappointing, as they were always soft and heavenly in the past.

Worse still was the Banh Mi Burger, which was missing the signature \"Pork Pate,\" and had a slice of Iceberg Lettuce in place of the usual fresh herbs (as I remember, usually cilantro and mint). I also couldn't find any shrimp in the burger (in the past the shrimp were plentiful). 

By the way, the burger wasn't bad, it was merely inferior to the way it used to be.

Bachi Burger is no longer a Las Vegas must experience, sorry to say."}
{"text":"Holy moly!!!
Soooooo yummy! You have to eat here! From the oxtail chili cheese fries to the black & green burger & miyagi-San burger & the krusty krab! The only problem is there was no room for dessert. Our waiter Adrian was great! Super helpful answering all of our questions about the menu & making great suggestions. I'm happy with what I ate, but there are several other things on the menu that I want to try! Everyone was happy, kids, mom, dad, grandma, grandpa!!!! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"We had the oxtail chili cheese fries with egg, Miyagi-San and the Shogun burger, along with Portuguese fried donuts. My beverage was the lychee milk tea with boba. 

I think if you advertised oxtail chili cheese fries the \"oxtail\" should be the main focus. In this case it wasn't. What we got was barely-there shredded oxtail meat in a stew of chili smothered over fries and topped with an egg. The chili was good for what it was but the oxtail meat did not shine.

The Miyagi-San burger was very flavorful. I liked it an would probably get it again. 

The Shogun burger had interesting and complex flavors. I don't think any one thing really shined. I could've have done without the poached pear. It sounded good on paper but it was just over-kill. The meat patty had a sweet teriyaki sauce and that was plenty sweet on its own. The frois gras was an interesting touch but it had the same texture of the poached pear. I'm not sure how frois gras is traditionally cooked but I would've wished mine was cooked a little more firm and salted more to counter the sweetness. I honestly think the burger was a whole lot of \"too much\". Frois gras... Unagi... Poached pear... Wagyu beef patties... All wonderful on its own and maybe it should be enjoyed that way. I wouldn't pay $26 for this burger if I can enjoy one of their $13 burgers just as much if not more.

If you're accustomed to drinking milk teas and boba. I would say the lychee milk tea was sub-par. If the idea is new to you, it's a cool thing to try but KNOW there are plenty of better places out there to get the same thing. 

Our food came out extremely late and our server was very apologetic and comped our drinks and dessert. I was appreciative but unfortunately that was my first experience."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas WEEKLY Magazine had an article on Burgers.. This place showed up, more specifically their \"Kalbi Burger\". So, I got another mission.. A burger mission!

Came here on a week night, place had a bull pen open layout and only a had a few vacant tables in a pretty decent sized space. Server was Kind and told us that everything they offered had asian inspired/influenced.

To Start:

Truffle Parmesan Fries: This was Shockingly much better than I would of ever expected. Not much going on but it was cooked just right, seasoned with the right amount of everything and the creamy/slightly tangy dip was Great!!

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Shreds of oxtail, fries, chili, cheese, garnished with slices of jalapeno with a fried egg right on top!! Too good to be true! Geez, now this is one of those \"get down and sloppy\" type of dishes!! Unfortunately, I did not like the flavor of the oxtail, nor the chli.. The fries and the Egg were Nice but, everything else was a disappointment!

I was so exctied I didn't order the magazine featured burger but  went with the first \"Specialty Burger\" on the list:

Ronin Burger: caramalized onions, japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, sweet bread bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side for dipping (taste like horseradish blue cheese). I subsituted the regular Angus with their \"Snake River Farms\" American Wagyu Patty. Overall, I did not like the many different flavors put in this burger, especially the bitterness of the red cabbage.. I think there was way too many things going on at the same time. I did love the richness of the patty and the buns were shiny, soft and super scrumptious!!

I will give this place another try. Next time, I will try the critically acclaimed burger. Plus I will try a plain custom burger just with the patty, lettuce, tomato and amercian cheese (no distractions from other supporting additions).  Service was really good, Pricing was ok I really enjoyed their Very Innovative Menu."}
{"text":"Where to start. Well here we go. Went for a nice brunch for a party if 4. Ordered appetizers and burgers, or so I thought. I watch as the appetizers arrived along with everyone else's food. I ordered a Waygu burger with bacon and cheese. I wonder everyone else's food in the restaurant arrived. My burger never came. When asked the waitress told me she had forgotten. Well too later cause everyone else was finishing up their meal. What a way to start the day. Endless to say the meal without my burger was $108. Pulled my card out to pay and was charged $208.  My missing burger cost me an extra $100?  Brought it to their attention and although there was only 10 tables seated  they got our bills mixed up. Maybe it just Vegas bad luck.  Should have gone with my gut and had a Big Mac and a smile. Never coming back. Better ways to drop a $100."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, but there's a lot going on there. Whatever you decide since they have a pretty extensive menu, remember to order the oxtail fries!!!

Order:
- Oxtail Fries - we should have gotten 2!
- Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries - good, but can't be oxtail!
- Spicy Miso Burger
- Shogun Burger - flavor explosions were insane, but you can't really tell it's a burger!
- Bachi Caesar Salad - not sure why this was ordered, but I think he was still drunk
- Sweet Tea - Soooo GOOD!!!!


TIP: If you can't come all the way out to Vegas, they just opened one up in LA!"}
{"text":"Came here by searching Yelp. Poured over the reviews and decided that this place was going to be my cheat meal. So the next day we drove over to some strip mall.

My boyfriend and I sat down. Nice big place. Lots of tables, photos of Japan, kinda dark for ambiance. 

For starters we ordered the pork belly buns and a couple of beers. I think one reserve is if a place is going to be semi-gastropub with classy burgers and some microbrews, then THE WAITER SHOULD BE ABLE TO EDUCATE US ABOUT THE BEER. I asked him how the honey wheat was and he said it was from some company and I said, \"But yeah, how does it taste\" and luckily my boyfriend had compared it to another beer. The waiter clearly stammered, but I'm a dick because he and I are brewers and we just wanted to see what his view was.

Anyway, the steamed buns came. There was pork belly, a bit of cilantro and scallion, a small slice or radish and quail egg. I loved it! If I can't go to Momofuku, I'll settle for this. Honestly, the egg was totally insignificant and I could have done without it. It's already rich from the pork belly. The belly was was tasty. Very tender and melted in my mouth!

After I ordered the Kiki's Burger with Truffle Parmesan Fries. On man, enoki mushrooms, Gruyere, onion jam, and bacon? I loved how nothing overpowered anything and I can taste all of its components.  The Truffle fries were so decadent as well and I loved how you got the whole cone. There are some places that will crumple a ball of paper up so the fries get a lift making it more plentiful. Honestly, I couldn't finish it, but damnit I tried.

Next time I go to Vegas for rock climbing or whatever, I'm so coming back. I wish this place existed in California."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Guy Fieri's Triple D and my dad tried it next time he was in Vegas. When I finally got to try it, it was worth the hype. Had the Kiki's Burger and the Truffle Fries. Amazing flavors! You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there to try their oxtail fries. Portion is good to share amongst 2-3 people. 4 stars because it doesn't have much meat and it was a lot sweeter than I expected, but still good. Would eat them again, but wouldn't crave them."}
{"text":"Top notch burgers. Visited this place with my wife when we took a vacation to Vegas. The fries with different sauces was amazing. The mushroom sauce was probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Also had the sausage as an appetizer.  Saw it on Triple D with Guy Ferrari  (sp). Would have gave 5 stars but the service was a bit slow, I think that was due to a shift change however. Would recommend for anyone looking for a different burger experience."}
{"text":"Warning: Don't come here if you're really hungry. There was a serious wait to get our food.

I really like the concept of this place. A restaurant that centers around offering quality burgers with an Asian flair.
The price is on par for the burgers although they now offer a Wagyu beef burger for $23. Yeah. Kind of steep but I heard it's somewhat worth the price by dinner companions who ordered it.

I wish I could give them a 3.5 because the wait for our food was LONG and it wasn't even busy. 

I ordered the Kiki's burger. It was as if all the right components were there but something was missing. Maybe salt? It needed something to transform it from good/really good to orgasmic.

The parmesan truffle fries were bomb though.
Also, our server was really nice."}
{"text":"Great Fries.. Garlic or Regular..Both dipping sauces were good also.

Had the duck roll and others enjoyed the burgers.
Still want to try a few others next visit.

Hidden back in the shopping center.

Saw this one on DDD.  Other location."}
{"text":"Great ramen place and great burger place! It used to be two separate restaurants with the same owners, but then they knocked out the wall and made it one big restaurant with two kitchens. Yes, as others have said it is a bit pricey. But it's always good and fresh. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait. And the waiting area is super tiny so you will likely be waiting outside. 

The Bachi pickles are really different! It is about six types of pickled items including pickled garlic, pickled radish, pickled carrots. It sounds kind of weird and when it came to our table I didn't think it looked very appetizing but each type of pickle was completely delicious!  Another great appetizer are the brussels sprouts. But they do come with a sprinkling of bacon so if youre  vegetarian beware. 

Unfortunately, my entrée came out about 10 minutes before my dates entrée. I think it's because we ordered from the two different kitchens. (One ramen one burger) But even that was OK."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and I ordered the ronin burger. The burger had an egg carmalized onions in a tonkatsu sauce and I think it was cabbage. Its a decent sized burger and it tasted really good. I just wish that the egg was runnier. We also ordered the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. Which were pretty good. We had two orders of fries and split between 4 people. Most likely youre looking at a $16. But it is well worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is ok. The service is good. Nice place to get together with friends and enjoy a beer & burger. The sweet potato fries are what keeps me coming. They are simple and amazing. I've been here several times and here's what I think of the sandwiches I got:

Wagyu Burger - Ok. Not amazing. A little too salty for my liking. If you have ever had L&L BBQ Beef... imagine that in-between 2 pieces of a sweet bun. I guess the salty-sweet thing kinda works. I won't get it again. 2 stars.

Ronin Burger - Better. There is a lot going on in this burger. The slaw and miso dressing were tasty. The Yuzu Citrus Aioli gave a little horseradish that killed some of the sweetness. That worked well. The egg got lost in everything going on in this burger, I didn't even taste it. 3-stars.

Bachi Fish - Good. I'm not a real fish person but this worked for me. It's simplicity is what was good for me. One of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had. 

Kiki's Burger - Best. I've ordered this several occasions. If you're a mushroom lover... you'll love it. The marmalade mixed with the salty cheese is a flavor explosion. I highly suggest accompanying this burger with sweet potato fries. 

The Truffle Parmesan Fries needs more of the Aioli on top of it. It's ok but not the best fries. 

I'll be back. Not the worst but not the most memorable. I'll give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is a bit far off the strip, but if you have a car, I highly recommend trying this place!

The unique thing about this place is that they serve ramen and burgers. It was so hard to decide what to get (so make sure you go with friends so you can each get something different and share). I decided to get a burger and my boyfriend got their spicy miso ramen with extra noodles and pork. I forgot which burger I have gotten but it was huge! It was delicious though. It had fried onion rings inside, bacon, and an egg! It was juicy and had the right flavoring. 

My boyfriend's ramen was also delicious. It was even more so because the weather outside was cold. They charge you $1/$2 for extra noodles, and they aren't kidding about it when they mean extra. They give you a lot. We had so much left over, even after sharing it between the two of us. Their bowls only come in one size. The soup was delicious. It wasn't too spicy, therefore we added more chili oil, chili powder, and whatever spices we could find. They had the option of making it extra spicy, but we didn't want to risk it on our trip. 

We also ordered a milk shake. I highly recommend you do. I got their strawberry guava milk shake and it was perfect with my burger. I didn't know how strawberry and guava would work out, but it does. It's rich and creamy. Each flavor was not too strong. We also ordered their oxtail fries as an appetizer. It was a good size plate filled with fries, melted cheese, beans, and other various stuff on it. It was good, I just wished it came out sooner. The fries came out like a few minutes before our food came out. By that time, we ended up not finishing the fries, barely touched it, because we were so full off of our own food. 

The overall pricing is not bad, it's about $12-$18 per burger or ramen, dep"}
{"text":"Two stars cuz the food is good. Why i give low ratings? Never make a hungry man wait to long! Walked in and got seated after 5min. What started to irritate me more is that no one came to approach us and ask for drinks or anything within the next 15min. Wtf! What pissed me off more is a bigger group got their fkn water and their burgers before us. Smh Thanks for making this hawaii boy disappointed on my very first experience of this place."}
{"text":"when I got out of the car i wanted to
punch someone in the face for the bad sewer smell that hit ME in the face.  

I'd give the location a neg 1 for being built where it probably shouldn't have been built.. that bad you ask? yes, the smell is in fact that bad.  

to my discomfort.. we walked in [through the back?] and it followed me inside.  it took a minute to get used too, but don't fear.. it subsides.

star 1: decor is very simple and clean
star 2:  they welcome you once you walk in.. and once we were seated, our very energetic waiter broke the menu down for us with short and detailed descriptions and we appreciated that a lot since it was our first time.

our order: 

kalbi burger:
bahn mi burger:
short ribs sandwich:
7oz angus burger:
sweet potato fries:
truffle fries:

star 3:  for the awesome take on asian hamburgers.  I've never had burgers that had a fusion of asian flavors... my [kalbi burger had kim chee in it!] tasty, flavorful, and the perfect size for one sitting. 

star 4: price! everything was reasonably priced and you definitely get your moneys worth... if more! 

I tried a little of everything we ordered and everything was an eye opening yum.. loved our experience here... except for that weird smell!

you sit around for awhile and it soon fades.. but bad smell and food does not mix.. not at all."}
{"text":"OMG!!! L-O-V-E the burgers, I've only been once as I am from out of town, but I must say I will visit prolly every time I'm in Vegas!!! My partner in crime had the Spicy Miso Burger and his burger was absolutely delish! I had a bbq sauce type burger and it was pretty good but I have to admit not as delish in my opinion as the Spicy Miso...only because the Spicy Miso is super duper flavorful with lots of punch.  The fries we had the parmesan truffle fries and jalapeno fries, Yum again!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family because it was close and apparently a \"Best of Vegas\" repeat-winner. What a mistake, and where to start? Order drinks and wait 15 minutes for them to arrive, with only two other tables occupied? Nice start. Ordered water without ice? What did we get? Water with ice. Ordered food and drinks at the same time, but it took 45 minutes to get our burgers. Ordered the burger medium-well, which should have a tinge of light pink. It didn't. Good thing I didn't order them well-done as I'm guessing it would amount to a self-defense weapon with otherworldly hardness!!! Add bacon for $2.50, which is one piece of bacon cut in half. Yes, we speak Russian, among other languages, but why in the world would one of the other two tables rubberneck themselves into what they apparently considered a stare to the death. That was extremely unpleasant.

In conclusion, terrible service with even worse food. The only person I would ever recommend this restaurant to would be: Mao Zedong, Stalin, Hitler or anyone with the last name Clinton."}

Wowowow. So much good food here! Between me, my sister, and our friend we got two appetizers and one burger each. We weren't disappointed and went home with a lovely food coma! We finished everything!

I recommend the Pork Belly Buns, Oxtail Fries, and the Miyagi Burger. The Pork Belly Buns were so good and it was tender! It's a great small appetizer. The Oxtail fries were huge, but beware of the jalapenos if you don't like it hot. Honestly, each dish was a 10/10! The fried egg on the Miyagi was perfection. The size of the burger was a pretty big portion and you get a really big patty which is awesome! It's definitely a true Asian fusion burger place. I read that the manager is from my hometown in Torrance too, woot woot!"}

The fries with porcini sauce, and oxtail fries were totally awesome!
I split half a Manga burger (7oz angus topped with scallop dynamite, Enoki mushrooms, sunny side up fried egg, with kalware sprouts) and a Miyagi burger with my homie and both were off the hook good!!
The staff was super friendly and fast. 
Totally must try if you are in the Vegas area, its a little fat off the strip but super worth it. 

I plan to get back here whenever I'm back in town"}
{"text":"Yet another favorite of mine. This place has some mighty tasty pupus and meals along with some good shakes for dessert! We tried so many different things that all tasted great. I dont think you can find 1 bad thing on that menu! Theres ample parking and the place is not hard to find. Not sure what there busy timers were there was no wait when i went. Def another great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Now that its so much closer to my house i will def be a regular here. 1st impressions always make or break and by far this place had me from the start. The staff super friendly and on point! Mad props Bachi crew! The food here was just as awesome as the original location. This time i went with the Mr Ho Burger and let me tell you, the mixture of that burger was amazing. Cooked medium well but still flavorful and juicy! The bun when you see it might look a little odd if your not used to that kind of thing but that taro bun blends so well with the flavors of the beef and pork burger mixture. To add there is diced Lup Cheong Sausage in there as well! This is by far my new fav burger. If your from Hawaii you would feel right at home and i felt right at home haha. The deserts are another thing to add to this place. SO GOOD! You just have to go down and try it for yourself!

The prices are decent, there is abundant parking in the lot and as for a wait, i guess we went a little late so there was none but every time i go to the original on windmill location im stuck waiting. This is a def place to hit up if your down to try fusion styled burgers, and fries!!! BACHI!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Me and my husband viewed an episode of diners, diners, and drives (triple D) through the food network featuring this joint so we decided to try it out and oh my goodness!  Heaven in your mouth,  but will be honest, you should be a burger and Asian infused cuisine.  We are never disappointed.  Dos is delish, a mouthful,  can be a bunch of messy goodness,  but taste bud heaven.  Service is always great,  friendly and prompt.  I've been to this location and the original location in Henderson.  Can't wait to try out the location in cali!"}
{"text":"The oxtail chili cheese fries and grilled chicken caesar are my go-to's when I'm not in the mood for their delicious burgers. Great atmosphere and even better service."}
{"text":"Totally not what I had expected. I was prepared for a more fast food type setting, and was pleasantly surprised (after I recovered from the sticker shock). 

The atmosphere was nice, we were seated almost immediately, water brought to the table promptly. The service was friendly and informative, the place was clean and the decor was very nice. 

I got the Kalbi burger (I'm Korean, what do you expect?!), and I can't recall what the husband got, but he liked it. 

The menu didn't say anything (as far as I could recall) about jalapenos in the order of fries we got to share (the boy is not a fan of spice), so that would have been good to know beforehand. 

Overall, we had a good experience there. I would go back again when I am ready to pay that price for an individual burger, but it might be a while. 

Oh, and it would have been nice to get a refill of water without having to wait more than 5 minutes with 2 empty glasses, especially with the surprise of the jalapenos."}
{"text":"Do NOT get the boba drinks here. All made w/ powder, nothing natural, tastes way too sweet and expensive! We tried the honeydew milk tea. Ick. 

Ok having said that, the burgers were delish!! 
Bachi is located in a strip mall. Nothing fancy. We came on a Sunday for lunch, and had to wait bout 30 minutes for a table of 4. We ordered the Ronin burger, Kalbi burger, spicy miso burger, truffle fries and onion rings. 

The burgers were all pretty sizable and the patties were juicy and very thick! Very well flavored beef. I tried the ronin and the spicy miso first and I'm glad I did because the kalbi was VERY FLAVORFUL because of the marinade and the kimichi. The taste stuck a bit more in my memory then the ronin and the miso. But I thought all the burgers were delicious in their own way. The buns were nicely toasted too. The fries and the onion rings were good, with the onion rings being thinner and a little on the oily side. I really also enjoyed the sun dried tomato dipping sauce and the garlic chilli aioli. so addicting! 

Service was pretty good. It took a little while for the burgers to come out, but it was worth the wait. The burgers were very satisfying without being heavy. Great meal off the strip!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here after seeing it on an episode of Triple D.  

Ordered the spicy miso burger and oxtail chili cheese fries. The burger was good, definitely juicy although I ordered mine medium rare and it came out medium.  Wish there would have been more heat though especially since spicy is in the name.  The egg was cooked well though and I do love fried eggs on burgers.  The oxtail fries were okay, just chili cheese fries with oxtail as the protein.  Katsuhiro was excellent though, very refreshing with their homemade strawberry puree.  

Service was good as well, will return the next time I'm in Vegas and am in the mood for an off the strip burger."}
{"text":"Can't say anything negative about this place.  It is so the wait.  The burgers are delicious!  Salt and pepper fries are perfectly seasoned and crisp.  Love their apple lychee soda.  This place is a must stop when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Bachi today for lunch and I have to say that they must be fairly new as the staff seemed not up to par. However, the burgers that we had were very good. 

I thought that the prices were a little high for an \"off strip\" burger joint as the Burger Bar at Mandalay Place had equally as good burgers at similar prices. I had a grapefruit soda that was good but cost $3.50. No refills!

The appetizers were very interesting and we ordered the Garlic stir fried edamame and it was good. The french fries were good but again due to the price of the burgers I thought that the fries should have come with the burger.

The total check for the two of us with the tip was $45 with no alcohol and I think that is a bit much for a small plain neighborhood burger joint."}
{"text":"I will never go to another location other than this one again! We come here at least once a month and that's super tough with two kids (1 & 2 1/2) but it's worth it everytime! Anytime someone comes from out of town we always take them here. Oxtail fries are a must, salads are good if you're into that sort of thing, burgers are always so perfect, shakes are great, and decent craft beer selection! My daughter loves the kids meal especially when it comes to the sundae part! We've been dissatisfied with another location and haven't tried Windmill but after the Russell experience I don't want to! Sahara for life!!! Hahaha"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we love Bachi Burger at the Ft Apache & Sahara location. Anytime someone comes in from out of town we take them. If we had the same food at that location as we did at the Rainbow & Russell we would never have had a 2nd visit. May 16th 2016 we visited the Rainbow & Russell location. Facebook just reminded me and I still had a bad taste from the experience so figured I should write. All our burgers were overcooked but one child's burger which was undercooked for how it was ordered. It took way longer for the food to arrive than the other location. It wasn't busy at all and that should have been our 1st hint. One group was wrapping up when we arrived and another showed up after we were already served...that's ALL the other customers. I will never go back to this location and I haven't been back to the other locations since then. This experience soured me for Bachi Burger..."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to eat here because the host told me five minutes for a table they were cleaning off keep in mind they were slow they cleaned off the table and she continued to go back-and-forth from other tables to the kitchen without seating me she even walked to the front and I assumed she was going to seat me after they cleaned off the table but she did not she didn't even tell me five more minutes so yes I left, there are far too many other restaurants who would love to take my money"}
{"text":"I had the spicy miso burger and it was fantastic! It was cooked perfectly and the waitress was very nice! Also, for the vegetarians out there, this place probably has one of the best and most unique meatless burgers out there!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I had the green and blue burger, cooked medium rare to perfection! The only reason I don't give it five stars was that our waiter was giving it his all but I think he was new and nervous cause he was kind of being weird and attentive when we didnt need him then ignoring when we did. But food was amazing."}
{"text":"Bachi's is a rediscovered secret. What was once a great burger joint is now a superb burger joint. Wifey and I starting to come here more frequently. Why? Flavor!!!!  Casual and friendly enough to make you wanna return...we do!"}
{"text":"Bachi!

After a long morning of sight-seeing and driving, we decided to stop for a late lunch before continuing on to nearby Red Rock Canyon.  I had Bachi Burger bookmarked for a visit on my recent trip, but decided to visit this location on a whim after we realized (thanks to the trusty Yelp app) that it was midway to our destination.

ALOHA:  Ever since Bachi Burger was featured on DDD on the Food Network with Guy Fieri, and discovering its owners/chef are originally from the 50th state, I was beyond ecstatic to finally have a chance to eat here.

LOCATION/AMBIANCE:  Ample parking available as its located in a shopping center/strip mall.  The restaurant is spacious and inviting with plentiful seating.

MEAT:  The melding of Asian flavors and ingredients is paramount as diners peruse the menu.  Asian fare combined with traditional American burger toppings are fused to create an outstanding burger.

*Kalbi Burger:  I love Korean food.  I really like kim chee.  And so, having house made kim chee as a component of this burger sold me immediately.  Other ingredients included kalbi marinade, green onions, and ko chu jang mayo.  I can't begin to describe just how much I enjoyed this burger.  It was perfectly cooked and the toppings fresh.  Easily one of the best burgers I've had.

*Shogun Burger:  My dining companion's choice.  Wagyu beef and unagi combined with pan seared foie gras , poached Asian pear, miso butter, and Yamamoto peach.  I can't speak for my friend's fondness for his choice, except to say that he ate nearly everything on his plate. 

We shared with the regular fries and onion rings as sides.  As lover of french fries, I of course loved the fries.  I also liked the batter of the onion rings, as it wasn't coated too heavily and therefore you could actually taste the onion as opposed to just a mouthful of hollow batter.  Both were excellent choices.

SERVICE:  Exceptionally good.  The restaurant wasn't crowded when we arrived and we were seated immediately.  The server was a friendly young man who gave us ample time to look over the menu.  He answered the few questions we had about the menu, took our orders, and returned with soda and waters shortly after.  He checked on us periodically throughout themeal and readily provided soda and water refills.  Good service overall.

BOTTOM LINE:  Phenomenal burgers.  Good service.  I'll be back hopefully on a future trip."}
{"text":"Love love love Bachi burger. I have been here so many times, I have tried almost everything on their menu. Love the Kalbi burger with truffle fries, Kiki, Ronin, sweet potato fries, their homemade pickles, sausages... everything I tried I liked! 

It is nice that they combined their ramen with the burger place so now you can order off of both menus, so everyone can get something instead of having to only order burgers or only ramen. 

The only thing that sucks is the wait time, if you want to eat during dinner time there is a guarantee wait time, especially on weekends. So either eat a little early or a little later...or go to their second location on Russell and avoid the wait time."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding reception. The bride is a chef so I trusted her tastebuds. I thought a burger place is odd to be a wedding reception, but I don't care because I love the food! I got the Kalbi Burger. My boyfriend got the Ronin Burger. We got Truffle Parmesan Fries. All were awesome!!!! Love them!!! Half of me hopes they get a franchise out in San Diego, but the other half wishes not because they're bad for a diet... but I don't really care!!! Will definitely be back for some when I'm in town!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I've heard so many good things about it... so I had to try it out for myself! I ordered the Kiki burger (without bacon) and boy let me tell you..... That burger is soooo tasty and juicy! And it had mushrooms, which is another plus because I love mushrooms! MUST TRY! We also got the Miyagi, and that too was so yummy. I love the taste of the furikake on the onion rings! We also ordered calamari and I loved that they weren't stingy with the calamari, it was a big serving to share (there were 3 of us). I'm coming back, for sure! 

Our server was Chris. He's very nice, helpful.. And on it! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a small-ish place in a strip mall. But it's got a menu packed with unique eats. Kalbi on a burger? Count me in! And they've got some seriously delicious french fries too. Cilantro and jalapeno on top of garlic fries? Love it! They also have some unique sodas, as well as adult milkshakes.

It can get crowded at peak times. Service is attentive and friendly. Food was piping hot and yum. Not much in terms of ambiance and decor, but the food is the star here.

It's actually two restaurants in one - when you are seated, you'll not only get the Bachi Burger menu, but also the menu for Shoku Ramen. 

I was pleasantly surprised on my latest trip here. I ate here once in 2010 and was not a fan at all - I really didn't like the burger. But my view has now shifted - I'm a total fan!"}
{"text":"I have been going to eat at Bachi Burger for about four years now and I have always been a fan, going at least once a month and their food is amazing. However, I just went to enjoy dinner with my parents and I had the worst possible customer service experience of any restaurant I have ever been too. The hostess was so rude to my parents and when I tried to communicate nicely to her she became rude to me. I work in customer service and I have never seen such an attitude be administered toward a paying customer. My parents and I ended up leaving and I honestly would not even go back because of how we were treated by the staff and I am by no means a person that complains."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is truly a unique Berger. I love the Ronin Berger. The beef has an excellent taste along with the Ronin ingredients served on the Berger. The place is very clean and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I ate here on my birthday and then I seriously dreamt about it for days on end so I had to come back within a week.  The Miyagi-san burger is amaaaazeeee and so are the oxtail chili cheese fries & truffle parmesan fries.

Service is great, but they seem really rushed.  I don't mind, because I'd rather spend more time eating my food than talking to the server."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a great place for a gourmet meal at an extremely reasonable price. 

Their oxtail chili cheese fries are out of this world. Also ordered the only kind of poultry burger on the menu which is a chicken/turkey mix and so delicious. Don't forget to
Order one of their amazing fries that comes with a palette explosion dipping sauce. 

I went for my birthday dinner and having a large group of 10 people they told us we can only have 3 separate checks with a max
Of 3 payments per check............ To break
It down if there is a group of 4 and each of which would like to use a debit card to pay ....... All hell breaks loose and staff gets very defensive. 

Great food great atmosphere, staff is a little arrogant but I can put up with bitchy girls all day for this food."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili fries ftw. The truffle fries are not very truffle-y. Had better at I Love Burger, Gordon Ramsay Burgr, and Guy Fieri's. They're covered in a mushroom sauce that's tasty, but I'd call them creamy mushroom fries, not truffle fries."}
{"text":"My first visit! Went here with 3 other friends after work one night. The restaurant was full and we waited about 20 min to be seated. The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because the service was lacking. I don't know if it was an off night but the service we received could be improved. No one came to our table to even take drink orders for a good 15-20 min. When we did get someone and started ordering, they were out of a lot of food items. Thankfully they weren't out of the burgers we wanted...how ironic would that be? It took a while for our food to arrive as well. I want to say a good 35-40 min. I don't know if that's the average wait time for food at this place but that seems quite long to me. However, I do have to say the burgers and fries were delicious. I got the miyaki-san burger and truffle fries. I tried my friend's garlic and pepper fries and those were good too. While I'm not in a huge hurry to come back to this location, if I were in a mood for their burgers, I would try the one closer to where I live and hopefully that location has better service."}
{"text":"With over 1700+ reviews what can I say that hasn't already been said?  The burgers are good and the service is sometimes hit or miss at times.  They do tend to get crazy busy on the weekends and peak hours but the quality of the food remains consistent, even on the busy nights.  

Personally, I like to build my own burger and add bacon and the Point Reyes blue cheese.  I get that this is a fusion burger spot and I might be missing the whole idea, but I have had nearly all of their burgers and I really liked the Black & Green Burger minus the spinach - which seems to just all fall out anyway.  It seems to make more sense to people that I build a burger rather than say a \"Black & Green burger - no spinach\" because that seemed to confuse people.  

Other things I would recommend at Bachi Burger:
- Salt and pepper garlic fries
- Oxtail chili cheese fries
- And both pork and duck Steamed Bao sandwiches.

Try to time your meal here outside of the normal peak periods and you should be able to enjoy a good meal without a wait."}
{"text":"I told my boyfriend I wanted a burger, straight up, no frills and he suggested this place instead. It's almost like my heart wanted this burger before I knew it existed. Wow. I had the Kiki burger and it was such a perfect combo of flavors. We did get the oxtail fries with our burgers but the portions were plenty and I'd be satisfied if I didn't have fries. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Besides the lazy servers (except the guy behind the bar bc he was actually tending to his customers- high five to you), the food is good. However, paired with the lack of customer service, this place isn't worth a repeat visit. The lack of five stars is for the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Horrible service. Stay far away. 

Walk into a restaraunt that was maybe 3/4 full and no customers waiting to be seated. Took almost 10 minutes to get seated and 15 at the table to even be acknowledged by the waiter. The pickled vegetables were decent and the pork belly bun was better. However, the waiter never brought small plates so we can actually eat and not make a mess every where; another waiter brought us some. Once finished with the appetizers we staked the plates and even though our waiter came by the table a few tomes he never took our dirty dishes away. Another waiter took them away when he brought our food. The spicy miso burger was 4 star worthy. The cocktails were about 4 stars even though our waiter tried to mess it upby only giving half an orange slice instead of  a full one; if you know anything about cocktails youll understand why thats a big deal. Once done eating we waited about 15 minutes and the waiter didnt come by with the check, instead we had to go ask another waiter for our check. The waiter was also stacking tickets; meaning hes run around to 5 tables taking orders then dropping them all off at the same time slamming the kitchen and making life more difficult for everyone in the long run. He also yelled in the restaurant \"everybody having a good time\" but in a sarcastic im stressed out way that should never happen in a restaurant. They also didnt have ingredients to make my original cocktail, after we orded and the food was about to come out (long wait) the waiter informs us they ran out of avocado for the burger, and still tried to charge us for the added avocado. They ran out of glassware for beer."}
{"text":"This place is usually not as crowed as the one on Windmill, usually no wait time at all even at dinner times actually. We tried this place when it first opened as a breakfast place, but also ate here for dinner a few times. I find the quality and taste of the food to be the same as the Bachi on Windmill. However, they are understaffed since they are not as busy as the Windmill location so the service is not the same. They usually have the wait staff act as hosts and buss tables too. We came for dinner once and waited quite awhile to get seated even though there were open tables, waited another while for our server to take our drinks and food orders.. BUT the waitress was super nice and friendly, we can see that she was busy doing a bunch of stuff at once, not like she stood around talking or was a bad waitress, she was just really busy. 

I don't mind the wait for the service at all, at least we get to sit and wait instead of standing like at the Windmill location. I love Bachi burger, my go to place for burgers. Love the Kalbi, Kiki, Ronin... the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. Love the food and can be pricy depending on what you order but I think it is worth the money."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger, you live up to the hype!

I have never been disappointed by the food or service at Bachi. Must-try items include the pickled garlic (part of the assorted Bachi pickles - I always ask for extra garlic!), the Kiki Burger, the Black & Green Burger and the often-mentioned Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. And if you're in the mood to eat a bit healthier, their protein-style burgers are just as amazing as the originals, although their hamburger buns are pretty delicious. Sure, Bachi Burger may be a bit more expensive  since you have to order fries a la carte, but it's totally worth it. Compared to other similarly priced burger joints in Vegas, Bachi Burger is hands down the best and most unique.

If you're planning a lunch visit, please get there early. The wait can be pretty lengthy if you get there at Noon."}
{"text":"I love their Truffle Fries!! Still, exploring the menu each visit. So far, everything tastes delicious. Good service."}
{"text":"The server overcharged our table for things that we didn't order. Attention to detail is important. 

The burgers are a bit too sweet. The chili fries dissapointed, looked great though. They need to put more fries and make sure the chili and cheese comes out hot and not luke warm.

I would go back and try it again. The bread is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Came here last week with my girlfriend because we haven't had bachi in awhile. It was on a Friday and surprisingly wasn't too busy! We were seated quickly. The server got us our waters and took our order immediately. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki and I got the Miyagi san burger. We also ordered the truffle fries. Food came pretty quick and the quality was good. The reason why I give this place a 4 star rating is because service is pretty slow after they take your order. They tend to forget about you after you're eating and don't bother checking up on you if you need anything else or more water. Had to ask more than 3 times for water refills. Also had to remind them for my check. I do remember other instances were service was a little better, but not amazing. Overall it isn't a bad place come eat if you enjoy burgers. Oh! Before I forget avg price per burger seems to be around $10-$16"}
{"text":"Great burgers usually but this visit, the burger wasn't as moist as I expect a wagyu burger to be. The egg on all 3 of our burgers was over cook (yolk was cooked through). My burger, Miyagi, was supposed to have caramelized bacon but it seemed like it was just bacon and only one small slice. Fries were great and sangria was really good. Server was nice but food took a long time."}
{"text":"Bachi Burgers, where have you been my entire life, and why can't I eat you in San Diego, CA.  There are so many positives about BB that Yelp should allow an extra star for just them because they're the only one worthy of that extra star.  BB was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, which that alone should warrant a visit.  But after my first visit, which arose because of many friends' recommendations, the reason BB is a must visit destination is resoundingly THE FOOD.  Let's put it this way, after my niece took her first bite of BB's renown Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, she said, \"I want to come here for my birthday.\"  We live 4.5 hours away.  Not too subtly, ORDER THE OXTAIL FRIES!!!

We were carnivorous after driving from San Diego, so when my better half posted on Facebook what our friends recommended to eat in Sin City, Bachi Burgers kept coming up.  There are multiple BBs in Vegas, so I chose the one with 1000+ reviews, which that alone should say something.  BB is located in a strip mall looking discreet and hidden towards the back, but the long line of people gives it away.  You will wait if you come during peak lunch or dinner times, but it truly is worth the wait.  Both the outside and inside is discreet, but you will see and taste food that's not discreet.  The inside decor comprised of black, complemented by the black attire of the staff, gives off a modern and chic flair.  Loved the Asian influenced artwork, specifically this panda painting.

Enough of my Yelp review format of describing the restaurant, let's get to why throngs can't get enough of BB.  The lower case letters of the name attached to the building exemplifies modesty, but BB's food is not modest in taste and deliciousness.  Here's what we ordered:  Bachi pickles, Oxtail chili cheese fries, Salt & Pepper garlic french fries, BBQ Bachi Burger 8oz Grass Fed Wagyu, Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, and a mandarin orange drink.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that all of the food above was to die for.  The Miyagi-san and the oxtail fries will be on my last meal wish list.  The pickles, an assortment of pickled vegetables, had that salt and vinegar thing going and I practically ate everything by myself.  The oxtail fries was piled high on a plate and our party of 6 cleaned the plate in minutes.  The mixture of the oxtail, chili, cheese, and the broken yolk was heavenly melodic to our stomachs.  Everyone in our party couldn't stop talking about how great the food was.  My Miyagi burger will be ordered again when I return.  This burger is my favorite burger of all time.  EVER!  This beats my previous #1 at Hodad's in San Diego.  The meat alone was juicy, succulent, and tasted like a premium cut from a very expensive cow.  The fried onions kept its crispiness and blended well with the tasty caramelized bacon.  The chili mayo was flavorful.  What put this burger over the top was the salivating broken yolk from the egg.  WOW!  Highly recommend the mandarin orange drink to wash everything down.

I'm bummed that I have to drive 4.5 hours to eat my latest additions to my last meal list.  For Las Vegas residents who can eat here all the time, I'm jealous.  For those that are visiting, a must visit despite the wait.  I like my niece's idea.  I want to come here for my birthday too."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I wanted to order everything?!

After reading the reviews and seeing Diners, Drive-ins & Dives, my husband I knew we had to try this place.

I ordered the Sangria + sake.  Delicious!

1. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, with Garlic Aioli, Fried Egg. $11.50
*Anything with a fried egg = I'm game.  The fries had a great flavor by themselves but the entire dish was yummy.  The oxtail chili & cheese was exactly what you expect (the oxtail is shredded) and the garlic aioli is a perfect compliment.  Would order again!  This is DEFINITELY enough to share (there was 4 of us!)

2. Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings; $13.00
*Three out of the four of us at the table ordered this burger.  Holy delicious onion rings!  The burger was cooked perfectly (I ordered it Medium), the bun of soft, but held it's own, the caramelized bacon was exactly that, fried egg worked well.  But seriously, the onion rings stole the whole show for me.  I am going to order just a side of these next time!

I was extremely full after eating all of this.  But the drink menu from the milkshakes to the boba, to the iced matcha green tea, to the tea latte's, I had this urge to order like 4 different things just to drink, but I knew the food had to reign supreme.

Next time I'll get some onion rings, a milkshake and some dessert since I didn't get to sample them this time.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was referred to this place by my fiancé's uncle. Pictures looked amazing and the description her uncle gave made it seem like it was worth trying out. The place was kind of hard to find for us since we weren't from the area but once we found it the restaurant looked dead. We ordered the miyagi and the oxtail chili cheese fries. The burger wasnt the best and didn't stand out to me but the oxtail fries were different."}
{"text":"The wooden table was sticky. I asked for a medium rare burger my burger was overcooked and had a slight pink center. My Father asked for a medium and was on the edge of being burnt. The flavor was ove4whelmingy and the flavor did not marry. I wont be back due to the food and crazy pricing."}
{"text":"The burgers are great, but the HH offerings need some love- currently there are just a couple of discounted drinks ($2 beer, $6 sangria, $5 listed cocktails), though I'm certain they once offered half off apps? I guess this is a thing of the past. Although I enjoyed the duck bao (great bbq sauce!), I'd stick to the burgers in the future. I was disappointed that I couldn't mix and match bao, despite there being two varieties available. 

I'm not sure if this is the only location with a liquor/beer license, or if this location just especially pushes them, but I was repeatedly offered a drink here.  I do like that this location is more open, bright, and modern compared to the South Ft. Apache location I typically frequent, which is like a cave in comparison. 

Truth bomb: the oxtail chili cheese fries are overrated."}
{"text":"I finally made my triumphant return to Bachi Burger a few weeks ago onky a girls' escape-from-LA weekend. 

After this visit, my sister and I have tried almost all of the burgers and will need to move on to the crab, chicken, and fish burgers (and baos).

During this visit we ordered the bahn mi burger and the kalbi burger, both of which were absolutely delicious and craftily done. The kalbi burger was topped with kimchee and tasted like a korean bbq meal in a bun. However, for me, the bahn mi burger really stole the show and may just be my favorite choice so far. Burgers are inherently greasy and meaty and, although this burger accomplishes that \"essence,\" it also managed to be really light and clean on the palate and brought through all of the herbal and fresh flavors of a traditional bahn mi sandwich. 

Seriously, the bahn mi is bomb-ass. 

The wait was about the same as the last time, but the timing was much better, with everything coming out at about the same time as opposed to the fries coming out first with the burgers following some time after. The service was great as it was the first time- the staff is very attentive and you can really tell they take pride in the menu. 

The only sadface from this visit is that I was really intent on trying the homemade poptart only to find that it wasn't on the menu anymore. Maybe next time! *fingers crossed*"}
{"text":"We had the Kiki burger, delicious. Truffle fries were good. Onion rings were ok. A little on the greasy side. Next time we won't order two fried sides. The burger was really good. I'd like to return to try their happy hour. All in all it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Boy, this place lives up to all the Yelp hype!

Hubby had the Manga Burger (daily special) and declared that it was the BEST burger he has ever eaten.  Crab, scallops and an egg on top of a burger???  Crazy as it seems, all the flavors just blended together like a party in the mouth - based on the one bite that I managed to sneak in.

I ordered the BBQ Bachi Burger.  I normally judge a burger place by how well they do a regular no-frills burger and this one did not disappoint.  Great quality meat!

We shared the sweet potato fries this time and it rocked!  Will probably try the truffle fries next time because they looked so good on the next table.

Would gladly drive 30 minutes through traffic to get to this place every time!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here and wouldn't turn it down if asked if I wanted to eat here. I bring a lot of friends from out of town to eat here and even the people who aren't really into burgers say that they like this place. The last time I came here I ordered kalbi burger, my husband ordered the miyagi burger, and my friend ordered the manga burger. We also ordered the oxtail fries as an appetizer. Everyone enjoyed their meal, tho the kalbi burger was just good, not my favorite. This place is pretty crowded during regular meal hours so be prepared to wait if you come during those times. Service has always been good every time I have gone."}
{"text":"Had an unfortunate experience today. Been coming to bachi, all locations, for upwards of 5 years and introduced dozens of people to your typically 5 star spot. 

Today was just bad. As a server myself I will not name names because I don't believe in hurting others' jobs. 

But I stopped in just now for a quick lunch and got one of my favorite burgers and asked for medium. 

Your normally juicy burger was way overcooked; it was well done. But I could've dealt with that. 

Here's where it gets bad. I literally had eaten 3/4 of the burger before the server even asked how I was enjoying it. I  was straight forward and said the burger was overcooked. The response \"sorry about that\" and they just walked away. 

So the follow-up on the food was way late and then no attempt was made to make it right. In fact, the next interaction was 1 minute later when the check was dropped.

I won't say I'll never be back because I can't fault Bachi for one bad experience. But talk about feeling like crap when you're only one of the three tables in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ive ever had.  I always thought it was some kind of weirdo hippy granola soy burger place but finally tried it out today anyway,  i was wrong,  ground beef perfection with spicey sauce and an egg,  calmari and a tall soporo for lunch.  spectacular."}
{"text":"BURGERS: Want a delicious, melt in your mouth burger? Get the Shogun burger, absolutely amazing! The foie gras with the wagyu beef just melts in your mouth. The wagyu beef is well seasoned and the miso butter, poached Asian pear, and unagi tops it off. If you want to be adventurous and try something different, I definitely recommend this burger. All the components of this burger put together makes for a very rich and delicious burger. 

My boyfriend got the Miyagi-san which was a little disappointing for the both of us. The patty was overcooked so it tasted a bit burnt around the edges which overtook the burger making it hard to enjoy. 

FRIES: Our table ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, the truffle Parmesan fries, and salt and pepper garlic french fries. My favorite was the oxtail and salt and paper garlic fries. The truffle Parmesan fries were just okay but could not compare to the other two. The oxtail fries were delightfully the right amount of sweet and spicy, every bite was enjoyable. The salt and pepper fries just made my taste buds ring, the garlic chili aioli sauce that was paired with these fries was also great. 

DESSERT: I got the Tahitian vanilla orange milkshake at the end and loved it! The orange aroma paired with the vanilla was fantastic. The milkshake was a satisfying end to the meal. I can't wait to go back here next time to try their other burgers!"}
{"text":"I can definitely see why people are fans of this place. However, I'm not in that boat.

Let's start with the wait. We came at a time where it should have been well after lunch time rush but there was still a 20 minute wait. If I'm driving into the middle of nowhere, the food better be damn good!

We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. 

The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: While it was interesting and enjoyable, it's not something I personally would crave. Was it tasty? Yeah I suppose... but the fries itself isn't specially made extra good. While eating it, I couldn't help but compare them to McDonald's fries. They were 11-12 dollars. 

The Mr. Ho's Burger: I definitely had better burgers! The bun was taro flavored, or so its said, and therefore it's purple. Unfortunately, you're not able to taste any subtleties because the sauce was so overpowering. We split this burger and I'm raised with the voice of my parents saying there are starving children in Africa if a grain of rice is left on my plate, even till today, but I simply couldn't finish this half of my burger because of how strong and over-applied the sauce was. And this was only half a burger. This was also about 12 dollars. 

Perhaps the rest of the menu items are sublime, that's a possibility. But there was definitely a disconnect between the food I got and the raving reviews. It's hip and trendy and could very well be a spot in the middle of West Hollywood or Downtown LA, but I'm very sorry to say it felt like this place was more hype than substance. I know I'm definitely in the minority on this.

Overall: Like the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, don't regret getting it but I wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"Amazingly complex flavors. House sodas are fantastic. Service superb."}
{"text":"DELISH!  Kiki burger, Spicy Miso burger and duck sandwiches ON THE MONEY!  And the starter of oxtail chili fries - yummy.  Nice size portions too.  GREAT service - and we were there today, Memorial Day, a holiday.  Quick service, friendly.  Nice casual place."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries
-my friends raved about the Oxtail fries so I thought I would give it a shot. The fries were not bad, needs a little kick of spiciness, chili could be better. 

Had the Mr. Miyaki. Def better than the first time I was here and got the ronin burger, but I still don't see how this place gets the reviews that it does. 

I know their concept is Asian fusion but instead of just incorporating the sweet elements from Asian cuisine they should more of the spice elements from Asian cuisine. Most their dishes here are just too sweet."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Burgers are big and juicy (although a bit overpriced.)
2. Onion rings crispy and big
3. Black Milk Tea boba ...delish!!
4. Kimchi burger is the BOMB!
5. Staff were nice

CONS:
1.  My Kiki burger tasted exactly like the Ronin burger and that means they were just ok.  Had a weird sweetness to it but both got better 1/2 way thru.

2.  Ordered Oxtail Chili fries which were forgotten and then brought out long after we had finished our burgers.  And these we just - meh.

3.  Bar counter and tables were wiped down with mildew-smelling rag.

4.  Only 2 individual bathrooms, so line is long.  

5.  Beer was overpriced.  

I'd go back to try a different burger  or maybe just stick with the kimchi burger!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers on the west coast!! We stop by every time we visit Las Vegas. lychee soda is the best and the burgers have an interesting Asian twist to them"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been to this location even though this one is the closest to where I live...
This one seems to be a joint venture with Shoku Ramen. They actually give you menus for both at the same time.
Maybe I'm a tough critic, especially when it comes to Asian-themed things, or maybe it's because I know what true Wagyu beef from Japan tastes like, but I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't really go ape-shit over this franchise. It's good but not mind-blowingly good. 
After delaying this choice for a while, I finally tried the Kalbi Burger this time. It's a Korean-esque burger that has that Kalbi marinade plus some Kimchee inside. Don't worry. It's not spicy. I didn't really like it that much. The quality is fine, it's just this particular burger definitely isn't my thing. Try the other burgers first if you haven't been to this franchise before.
Service is excellent overall. This place is always busy, but the servers did not ever forget about me and kept my drinks full. Food came out fast despite me going in during lunch hour.
This joint can run up your bill pretty quickly. If you have to have an appetizer, then your burger and fries (which are NOT included), and you have to have an alcoholic beverage to go along with your fancy burger, then top it off with some dessert, you're looking at $35+ easily per person. This is definitely a joint that you go to for the hip-ness of it."}
{"text":"Bad service waiting for more than 1 hour for 2 stater items. They even served similar food to other tables which came after us. So upset about this place. I wrote BAD SERVICE and 0.00 tip on the bill for 2 French fried and cancel 3 burger"}
{"text":"Great interesting burgers!  I walked in the door to an industrial minimalistic restaurant and was greeted immediately by a friendly staff member. My waitress was knowledgeable and personable. She really did cater to my every need with a smile to boot! I love sauces and she brought me some of the sauces I was interested in. They were all wonderful and so different! I was dipping my truffle fries in a variety of sauces which made every bite different and exciting. It was quite evident they were using high quality ingredients to create these interesting flavor combinations. Burger cooked perfectly! Finally pink in my burger!!! 
Something else unique that I really appreciated was the spin on \"salt and pepper\" at the table. For the pepper they had a very find ground red chili pepper that has a lot more luck than the basic black pepper. For salt they had some smokey black bit more course salt. As if that weren't enough, they also have a chili water to drizzle on whatever you please. It has a nice flavor and kick. 
If you like fun interesting flavors, premium ingredients, awesome sauces, friendly knowledge staff, and a full belly, do yourself a favor and check out Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!!! I would give a five start just based on the food. Customer service is at BIG FAT ZERO!!  There is no organization with the staff members basically who ever is free will wait on you. After our appetizer one waiter asked us if we were ready for our check and the other waiter was behind her with our food. After finishing our food we asked for the check not only did it take a long time but once we gave her our cc she but the bill on the counter next to their cash register  and went to clean tables then after 5 minutes she realized she needed to charge it and bring us the receipt. LOL I was watching her the whole time."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite Bachi location, although it is the one my fiancé and I frequent the most, due to its location and its far better service and food than the Windmill Bachi. We usually receive superior service here, but one day we ordered our usual spicy miso and 7 ounce angus burger with just fries and didn't receive the fries until after we finished eating, so we just removed them from our order. Despite this one incident, we will keep coming again."}
{"text":"Something new again!
But again, everything was good, but felt somewhat light. 
Is it because I had a vegiburger? 
I will go again to try other burgers! 
Awesome taste! 

Food: Good
Price: Pricy(?)
Service: Good
Parking: Good"}
{"text":"Service:
Went to this location 1/2/15 with my sister.  Line out the door.  The hostess at the front was busy flirting with two guys - had to interrupt to get my name on the list.  Waited 30 mins and watched as the hostess continued to upset other customers with her very rude behavior.  Unbelievable that the owners allow this young lady to work at their establishment! 

Service:
Waitress - wonderful server!  Very nice - apologized for the delay and was very attentive. 

Food:
Amazing - had garlic fries, Bahn Min burger, and Miyagi burger.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. Awesome place, awesome burgers. I had the Kalbi Burger just recently and I'm dying to try every burger on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a black and green burger...yummm.  Hidden spot off the strip.  You must check it out."}
{"text":"First of all, everyone's correct! Service sucks balls! Got the shogun and the foie gras made the sandwich special. Would I buy it again? Probably not.. Over all food was slightly above average and the service was sub par."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out after reading all the great reviews. 

Walked in, stood there for a few minutes. No acknowledgement, sign said \"please wait to be seated\". A few waiters walked by, still nothing. 

If I could give the place 0 stars, I would. Not even going to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger joint I've been to in Vegas. The service is always very friendly and on point. And the food..... AMAZING. So many interesting burgers to choose from and they're all tasty in their own unique ways. They also have a nice variety of delicious fries that come with their own specific dipping sauce. These people are burger geniuses."}
{"text":"There was only server during the lunch rush and I felt so badly for her because they were pretty busy. Even with all of the other tables, she kept a positive attitude and gave us great service. 

We started with the Brussel sprouts and the kale salad. Both were really great and filling. We probably could've ended our meal right then and there and been satisfied with not only the quantity but the flavor. The kale isn't bitter or overly earthy like you would expect. The dressing complements it very well and the cranberries are a sweet addition. 

We then got the oxtail fries that everyone was raving about. I expected it to be just oxtail in spices braised but it came out as a chili. The dish was too salty overall for me to truly enjoy it and I was really disappointed because it was a huge portion and we had to leave it. 

We ended with the shogun burger. This burger was so so. The first bite was really good but you can't really taste any of the components except for the eel. A bit pricy but I understand the ingredients warrant it. 

I'd come back for the kale salad."}
{"text":"Freaking A!  What a place, what a place!  I just can't get over how exotic and flavorful everything is here so far!  A friend from out of town came in and first on our list was Bachi Burger!  Like the last time, the place was pretty empty, not too busy, but the one thing my gf and I spotted was a new burger!

*The Shogun Burger* (not on the website) $23
Features the Wagyu beef, eel, poached pear, and foie gras! Packed with major flavor and super exquisite! I highly recommend getting a taste of this one.

We also ordered the Crusty Crab and Kalbi Burger. Both which were tasty as well.  I loved the authentic crab on the Crusty Crab and the sauce on the Kalbi Burger.  We went with the eggnog creme brulee with gingerbread cookie.  There were comments of the rum flavor being strong, but I hardly tasted it.  The gingerbread man cookie was cool with powdered sugar on it and tasted perfect.  They also featured a treat all the way from Hawai'i called the Tako Toffee.  It's toffee with a thin layer chocolate and almonds.

Another great experience at Bachi deserves another 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Do not let the pretentious look and vibe fool you.  This place has great food.  And unlike what I've heard from other reviewers, the staff is friendly and willing to help in whatever way necessary.  They'll cook it however you want it.  They'll add items or hold items if you want.  They will go out of their way to make your experience great.

Everything we had was amazing.  The shrimp chips and truffle fries were great.  Everyone had a different burger - all were outstanding.  Even my 5-year-old's kids plain cheeseburger was great.  

One caveat...  If you're anything like my wife and aren't an adventurist eater, stick to the \"build your own burger.\"  You'll get a great burger made how you want it and you won't be disappointed.

If you're in the area, stop by.  I'm sure you'll love it."}
{"text":"Even though it's not a brand spankin' new  burger joint it is to me because this is the first time I've ever eaten here. I'm ad I did because Bachi Burger was bomb! 

The Russell location is one of the newer ones and the interior is super clean and super cool. With very nice and friendly staff that will accommodate anything you would like. My wife order the simple build your won burger and I got the Pork Belly Baos because I am a huge sucker for pork belly anything. We also ordered the Oxtail chili fries and a side of regular fries for my daughter. 

The food came out fairly quick which is a good thing when you have a terrible 2 year old and a fussy 7 month old. We shared the oxtail fries and both my wife and I loved it. Fries reminds me of McDonald's fries as far as look goes but tasted a million times better. The oxtail chili with beans was a nice touch with a slight tangy sweet flavor. My favorite part was the runny fried egg on top and the fresh jalapenos. These fries are worth calling my new obsession. The Pork Belly Baos came out on a long plate with 3 small but decent size baos. The bun was super soft and had great texture not to mention the perfectly sweeten flavor. The Pork belly \"the star of the show\" was tender, sweet and melts in your mouth. The thin layer of fat makes my mouth water just talking about it. With a tiny bit of veggies and a slice of hard boiled egg and no extra muss or fuss. These little things are so good on their own but to push it over the top they give you this amazing dipping hoisin sauce that is mind blowing. 

The Burger OMG the burger the grilling and the seasoning is \"perfection\" and the juicy tender patty with the right amount of chard is insanely good. Topped with melted cheddar and a side of the fixing this burger was tasty but, a bit pricy I think it was $16 or something without fries or anything else. 

The restaurant was neat and the staff were awesome so this definitely won't be my last visit. I would recommend Bachi Burger to anyone!"}
{"text":"Holy Burger!! This place rocks!!! Wanted something off the strip so we didn't have to pay 25 for a burger and found this little gem...

Delicious burgers ranging from 10-18 a burger, plus 2-6 for fries... Not bad in my opinion.

Came here twice in a period of 5 days and each time was unbelievable... 

Some of the best burgers I've ever had in my life.. 
Note to owners: please open this restaurant in the La Quinta, CA area!!! We need a burger place like this!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the gourmet burgers with an Asian twist. Actually got my pal and her friend from Chicago to try the place and it passes the \"Chicago Test\"...being that everyone I know from there is picky about food...Chinese sausage, 3 kinds of mushrooms or maybe Korean BBQ and Kim chi on a burger sound weird? Maybe but it's REALLY GOOD STUFF"}
{"text":"Another stop on our Vegas food vacation!!  We first visited the location on Windmill - but it was packed with a 40 minute wait.   The hostess recommended trying this location about 10 mins away, and I'm glad we did!  At noon on Black Friday, there were only 3 other parties seated, and we had awesome service from start to finish. 

Mindy greeted us as soon as we walked in, sat us and got our beers to us right away.  She was very attentive throughout our meal, and definitely made us feel at home.  Just an awesome sense of humor, and great interaction/customer service skills.   She's a gem, and we hope her bosses know how lucky they are to have her!!  

On to the food - we ordered the oxtail fries, the black and green burger, and the Miso burger with a Waygu patty.   Literally the best burgers we've ever eaten, and we come from Burgerland San Diego, where Hodads, Slater's and other local gastropubs push the limits on delicious.   The oxtail fries remind me of poutine, but the Asian flavor profile gave it an extra something special.  Boyfriend and I swapped burgers about halfway thru - both of the burgers had really interesting, delicious flavor profiles, and the buns held up really well despite the moist burgers and sauces.  

A short drive from the strip, this is well worth the trip.   The prices are really reasonable, we had a couple of beers with our meal and it was about $50 before tip.   We'll definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"From their menu: Kiki's Burger - Angus  Beef, Sautéed  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized  Bacon, Sweet  Onion  Marmalade, Gruyere  Cheese, Garlic  Chili, Aioli. IMAGINE! Just imagine...

Sweet onion marmalade? Such a beautiful idea. Caramelized BACON? Down! Put these in between two extremely doughy, soft, wonderfully toasted buns, perfectly grilled beef patty, with a bunch of mushrooms, gruyere cheese, garlic chilli, aioli.... omg. I picked this burger because it listed all my favorite things. It's seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had. The buns were amazing FORREAL.

Ox tail fries - bomb, but the meat chunks need to be bigger. Overall, very good experience on my end. My mouth is salivating. I wanna come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had a miyagi-san, a wagyu burger w/ crispy onion strings, bacon, a fried egg, and an awesome BBQ type glaze. It was on a soft, eggy, sweet roll. Bangin burger! And cheaper than anything comparable you'd find on the strip 

The truffle parm fries were some of the best I've had. They porcini mushroom sauce on them is soooo good. And the roasted red pepper aioli is the perfect complement. 

The fried chicken appetizer was also awesome! Everything we had was so good! I'm definitely hitting this place up again when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Saw Bachi Burger on the Food Network so I really wanted to try it and overall very satisfied!! :)

Ordered:

Ronin Burger (Medium done): yummm, juicy and flavorful, the citrus aioli sauce made it very sweet

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: loved this!! Very flavorful and perfect amount of cheese, don't mix the whole thing though, gets soggy quick!

Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger (Medium Done): You can really taste the batter of the onion rings in this one! Flavors are a good mixture and do not overpower .. tasty!

Service is great, but then again I went at 11AM when they just opened :P, plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"Vegas is one of the best places in the country to eat and this place is just further evidence of that fact. We got the oxtail fries, banh mi burger, and miso burger. So incredibly well cooked, seasoned to perfection. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"I'll have to say, they do have really good truffle parmesan fries. Their burgers were tasty.....but they're pricey. This is a great spot to hang with friends, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way just to eat here."}
{"text":"(First off, I am giving this place a 4 star rating because I can't give it 3.5 stars which is what it really deserves.)

Parking: The main entrance is in the rear and there is no handicapped parking close.

WiFi: WiFi was iffy for Windows users. I suspect that this is a MAC snob establishment and not an issue for MAC users.

Noise Level: There is no noise dampening in the whole place, hence you can hear everyone and everything. The noise made it difficult to converse, even over a two-top.

No Booths: While not having booths may be convenient for employees to put together for large groups it is not comfortable for others. Personally I prefer a booth. Having only tables presented a unique situation for me; I have a hat and cane. I have a hat because it covers my balding head and the cane because I like to walk, but where do you put them at a two-top? The unfortunate answer is you put them on the floor.

Décor: The wall decor was lacking. They claim to want to showcase works from local artists, but it would seem that $2000 photos were the focus. Too few to be interesting, but the ones they did have were really big (not very good, just big). Maybe it is better at night.

Going Green: Want to be green, use cloth napkins for both dining and the moist nap after the meal. Also, offering a hot, moist napkin after the meal would be very classy. Cloth napkins also add a touch of class.

Place Mats: The place mats are \"natural\" and have a texture. They are uncomfortable to put your arms on. But when the staff was clearing the table nearby, they just wiped then off. The staff did not clean the sauce that had spilled into the mat. The mats should have been replaced. I am left to wonder what was still in my mat.

Table Setup: Each table has a salt pot instead of a shaker. I am wondering where the wooden spoon has been... There is no black pepper on the table, but a service of a \"chili water\" (WAY hot), and what I was told was \"Japanese Pepper\" that seemed to be some sort of pepper powder (again, spicy). Also a ceramic holder of toothpicks was on the table. What on the menu would I need toothpicks at the table for?

Service: We were greeted multiple times within seconds of walking in and seated promptly. All service oriented portions of the experience were done in a timely manner. However we had to remind the waitress to serve our fries and we were asked 3 times if we wanted dessert, annoying.

Ordering: You order everything a la carte. When you order a \"Bachi Burger\" for $6.00 get you the burger, nothing else. You then order your sides all separately and they all come separately. This a la carte ordering seems to be a trend around town, I have seen it before and I am not a fan. When the order comes and there are all these separate plates and serving vessels and glasses the table gets crowed really easily. In the fries all come with some sort of dipping sauce, but with everything on the table it can be hard to get to some times. When you see a burger on a large white plate with nothing else, it looks rather sad. Sure it highlights the fabulous burger, but it also point out how small it is.

The Food: My wife and I both ordered the Bachi Burger, it was lunch and that is all we wanted. The 5 oz. Angus burger was cooked correctly to medium (although I ordered medium rare) and the bun and fixings were correctly assembled. The burger tasted great and did not fall apart (believe me when I tell you this is an issue in the world of burgers). My wife also ordered the Sweet Potato Fries which we would come back for again. I ordered the Garlic Salt and Pepper Fries that came with a curiously strong Aioli that I would have loved to put on my burger. We both ordered sodas that were great (again, my wife's pick of the Mandarin Orange was the winner.)

I would have loved to have had all this on one plate; it felt so hodge podge it made for a slightly uncomfortable eating experience. Honestly, it should be: Pick you burger, add a sauce, pick your fries and other sides and give it at one price based on the burger. Put it all on one plate and dress it well. 

Other Thoughts: 5 ounces is not a 1/3 pound burger and most other places around doing good burgers are doing either 1/3 to  1/2 pound burgers, so again I felt a bit short changed. Surely adding an ounce would put you up to snuff. The potato fries are cut too thin. I am hoping you are using fresh fries and not frozen bagged fries just dressed up, but in any case the fries are nice and crunchy but there is not enough fluffy potato within. Your Sweet Potato Fries are thicker and better cut (Hmm... me thinks kicked up US Foods).

This is dining at a level that wants to be fine, but without that stodginess. I can get behind that but there needs to be a slight rethinking of the menu and very minor changes to the environment with the dining area. What is has left me with is \"Pricey Burger Place\" that I will go to again in a few months to see if they have fine tuned the experience."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time eating here with my family. The service and food was outstanding. They have improved their service and speed of getting the food out.
We ordered fried calamari, truffle fries, garlic fries, stir fried edamame and oxtail chili chees fries. We also order the Kiki burger, Bachi burger, Black and green burger and the fish burger. The kids loved the oxtail fries and their burgers. My favorite was the stir fried edamame and the Black and green burger. My wife really liked her fish burger. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Food poisoning went to emergency room! We were so excited to eat here the food was good on the way \"in\" but went to emergency room for food poisoning do not eat here!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this place, but my experience turned out great. I ordered some wings and a Lonely Bird sandwich. The wings were perfectly cooked and don't even start about the sandwich. It was so tender and juicy I had to stop and hi five my server. The staff was more than accommodating. Very engaging and friendly. Hope to see more from this place."}
{"text":"Bachi burger never disappoints. So glad we finally have one on our side of town. Decent in size and complete with a full bar. 

There's usually a long wait and crowds at the other Bachi burgers we've been to, but I don't think very many people know about this location. We were the only ones in the restaurant for our late lunch. 

Always start with the oxtail chili cheese fries. A blend of shredded meat, chili, gooey cheese, peppers, and a fried egg atop a mountain of fries. On point!

Though all of the other burgers are just as tasty and JUICY...I usually get the ronin burger. The burgers are decent in size and I'm usually unable to finish it after killing the oxtail fries. 

Service was outstanding. Being the only ones there, they were so kind in allowing us to try their radish salad (I think) and a bread pudding. Not a big fan of the salad. But the bread pudding was delicious. Melted in your mouth like buttah."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  What a delicious surprise. When my son suggested we go there I was reluctant because I was not really in the mood to try anything new and normally not a 'burger person'.  We started w/ the specialty appetizer, oxtail chili cheese fries-- great balance of flavors and there was a perfect ratio of toppings to fries, which were crispy and cooked perfectly. 
The burgers are sublime. Unique, and full of flavor on the perfect bun. We literally just got back and had to write this because we were so inspired and happy to have such a satisfying and delicious meal.  Can't wait to return to bachi burger to try something else.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, casual but modern and elegant.  Our server was knowledgable, friendly, and attentive.  Prices are extremely reasonable.  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Love, love Bachi Burger! Fast and efficient service! Food is amazingly good and affordable! Their burgers and packed with flavor! Also can't go wrong with their sweet potato and garlic fries! Will always keep coming back! Please open more locations!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to finally try this place out after friends from California begged us to eat here with them. I was honestly disappointed because I was expecting a lot from this placed based off of the hype surrounding it. It was alright.. definitely not worth the $120 bill it came out to be. 

Appetizers:
Bone marrow
Duck steam buns
Oxtail fries

Entree:
Loco Moco burger 

I enjoyed the loco moco burger a lot, the risotto was amazing and everything blended well with each other. The bone marrow was alright, I feel like the toppings overwhelmed the natural fatty taste of the bone marrow so it just ended up tasting like toppings... None of us really liked the oxtail fries because it ended up tasting like regular chili Fries without any elevations.. I was the most disappointed with the duck steam buns; the were very chewy and hard to eat, I choked on it and couldn't even get a clean bite through.. I've never had duck with that consistency before and using a knife to cut through was still VERY difficult. 

Overall, I gave this place a 3 star because it was mediocre. The server was nice and kept checking back in with us. I feel like the idea of a fusion Asian burger place is awesome but they could've done better with ththis execution of Some of the items on the menu. I did however like their apple lychee Italian style soda and the loco moco burger  I would probably explore other burgers next time I go here, but I am in no rush to eat here again."}
{"text":"My God, I have never consumed a burger more divine than the Shogun.  Melted in my mouth, the foie gras was perfection.    A truffle gravy fry side complemented my meal.   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"First of all, if people want to eat healthy, don't go to a burger joint.  With that said, I heard about this place through friends who live in Vegas.  I live in California and was in Vegas for the weekend so I decided to stop by before heading back to Cali.

First impression of the restaurant- clean and cozy.  

Now on to the most important part, the food-  most creative burgers I've ever encountered!  I decided on the Banh mi burger since I love Vietnamese sandwiches.   

The burger consisted of pork, shrimp, pate, pickled veg, basil, curry aioli and nam plah dipping sauce. The ingredients were fresh and everything was tasty and delicious.   I also ordered the truffled fries and a boba drink.  Next time I want to try the Ronin burger.

Definitely returning here whenever I'm in town.  The best part is the price!  A processed Big Mac meal is about the same.  Please open in southern California!!"}
{"text":"The best and creative burger I have ever seen. I hope it's still open. Every trip to Vegas is a must go to this place!
You are welcome! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Picking up to go and although I like their food but ever since this place got super popular, the service is terrible and the workers are rude. They don't even acknowledge you when you walk in. I would have called in and placed my order if they would had picked up the phone or made sure their phone wasn't off the hook. It's not like the Summerlin location is any better as well.  Will think twice if I ever want to come back."}
{"text":"They take peanut allergies serious here which is great for our family who has many kids with peanut allergies.
Everything we had here was made to perfection - the ox tail fries with fried egg on top,  Ronin burger (my personal fav) and the Shogun (foie gras any one?!).  The burger was cooked to perfect medium rare which made it juicy.  I ate everything on my plate and dug into my god daughter's salt/pepper fries with jalepenos.  OMG, my mouth is watering just thinking about our heavenly meal."}
{"text":"Service is poor. Twice here. Called and left take out order and hour later still waiting? $42 for 2 burgers and 1 fries. Think I'll pass next time. Better burgers with better service out there"}
{"text":"My friends have been hyping this place up for such a long time. I'm glad I finally got to try it. We came up to Vegas on a Saturday around 1PM. We had a large group of 9 and waited quite some time, at least they were nice about it. It's located off the strip on the South end in a shopping plaza.

Our server was really nice and helpful, he knew we were hungry so we jumped right into ordering.

Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - Delicious, probably my fav
Kiki's Burger - the mushrooms seems a bit misplaced, wish they weren't so soggy, but everything else was super juicy
Oxtail fries with fried egg - MUST GET THIS TO SHARE, so bomb, it's like canto restaurant indo fried rice but on fries instead.

All in all, is this the best burger place in Vegas? Probably not. Is this the best bang for the buck burger? Hell yes. These burgers are roughly $11 and they are delicious for the price you're paying compared to other burger spots on the strip."}
{"text":"This review is for: January 1, 2017. I haven't visited this location in almost two years, however after this experience I fell in love with it all over again. I walked in around 5pm and after we were seated it seemed as if the parties after us were getting bigger and bigger. I'm impressed with how fast paced the workers were that night. 

Ordered the highly recommended KiKi's Burger (Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Gruyere Cheese, Sweet Onion Marmalade and Garlic Chili Aioli) with a side of Just Fries. I was not disappointed in the quality of food at all. Everything was delicious. 

I read through other reviews of this location before I walked in and paid very close attention to the customer service I received (considering that was a main complaint). The waitress I had was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. It was friend's first experience there and my waitress was patient and kind enough to ensure he got a great experience."}
{"text":"Well... this didn't start off on quite the right foot. We arrived at 10p on a Saturday night. Upon walking in, we noticed that there was plenty of seating around, so we didn't expect to wait- and we didn't. However, the host sat us at the first table, right by the door, crammed against the wall with a view of the host stand. Um...
So, we asked if we could be moved. We were, to the back of the restaurant. Only slightly better. This wasn't going well... The whole seating situation there is a bit of a CF, though, all of the \"booth\" dining is WAY too close together, which we found out when a group of rather large individuals were crammed right next to us (and as a reminder, there were plenty of tables available).

Okay... lets move past that. The service overall was fine enough, although we ended up having two servers because one took his break while we were dining. 

The food.... Not bad. The truffle parmesean fries were delicious! I ordered the \"Kiki's\" burger and was overall pleased with it, it had a lot of flavor, was juicy, and I loved the bread, but the sweet onion marmalade overwhelmed the burger. I could barely taste the mushrooms, and couldn't taste the egg or cheese at all.

So, all in all, it was pretty close to a 2 star review, but I'm feeling a bit generous. I don't think it is worth a revisit, though."}
{"text":"Great burgers!!  Come early as the placed is packed.  Well worth the wait. Good stuff!!!!"}
{"text":"The Miyagi burger is the bomb!!  This is coming from someone that doesn't like to eat burgers!  A must try.  The ramen noodles was alright, not the best yet enough to satisfy my craving.  I like the oxtail fries over the truffle fries...but I wouldn't order it again as I've had better fries.  The service was great, will  definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"YUMazing!! Ate here late last night and wow... I knew this place would be bomb.com but it even blew away my expectations.
I had the Kiki burger & added a fried egg. The bun was sooooo tender and buttery, the cheese was melted perfectly, the egg was just right, the meat ( cooked medium) was soooooo good.
And the service was stellar. The entire staff was so nice and helpful. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted ( everything sounded tooo good) and they were so helpful and patient with my fermale indecisiveness. 
If you are craving an amazing burger w the best quality ingredients and original topping selection, this is your place! I will most certainly be back on my next cheat day to try the steamed buns and another burger =)"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend during a trip to the strip for a Vegas Bachelor party and it was as good as the homie said. I got the Ronin burger and it was a fat juicy ass
BURGER! that got my appetite satisfied. Angus Beef  Caramelized Onions  Japanese Cole Slaw  Miso Goma Dressing  Fried Egg 
Katsu BBQ  Yuzu Citrus Aioli for $12. Not your normal McD's burger that's for sure. I wish they had this in the Bay cause I would come back more often. Only weird thing is after getting the check and pitching in to pay, we came out short $50...strange...maybe the group next to us enjoyed an extra free burger on us."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm so glad I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. It is delicious! The burgers are piled high with really quality ingredients, but be prepared to wait. Ever since this place has been on tv, people flock to it. Also, if you're staying on the LV strip, taking a cab here will cost you about $20.

We started with the Chili Fried Chicken. It was perfectly fried, without too much excess batter, and the sauce was spicy, salty, and a little sweet. You could definitely taste the garlic. The cabbage that came with our appetizer also gave it some good texture to contrast the relatively soft chicken. Two thumbs up.

I ordered Kiki's burger, and my fiance ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" burger with a fried egg on top. When we saw everyone else's burgers come out, we assumed we'd be full after an appetizer and a burger. We were right. Anyway, the Kiki's burger melted in my mouth, and I really enjoyed a new take on a bacon-mushroom cheesburger. My fiance's Banh-Mi burger was so interesting! You could actually taste the shrimp in the patty, which also contained beef and pork. The herbs and pickled vegetables were tasty, but be careful, because the aioli and the sauce together can get very spicy. 

Our waitress was very friendly, as was the young man who refilled our waters. They each said, \"please, thank you, yes ma'am, yes sir, etc.,\" and they were very helpful anytime we had a question about the menu. Overall, a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger! Remember that because it's the only place you will ever need to know and go after trying one of their incredibly juicy and delicious burgers.

Here are some tips before you head out there for the first time, assuming you're staying on the strip. Be sure to grab a few (preferably three) of your hungry and adventurous food buddies with you. Then holler a cab and don't forget to get a contact number from the cab driver/company so you can call for a cab when you're done. Bachi Burger is located about twenty minutes away from the strip and there's hardly any cab around that neighborhood. If you don't want to be stranded in the middle of nowhere for hours, remember to get that number. Also, it will run you about $60 cab-fare with tips for round trip. It's not that bad when you split that among four people. Another plus side of having few more people venturing out with you is that you'll get to try few more items on the menu. Yes, it may sound like a lot of hassle and expensive just to try a burger, but that BURGER is worth it!

As for recommendation from the menu, I'd skip Ronin and Kiki Burger and go straight to the juicy and flavorful Miyaki-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger. It's a perfect combination of caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, fried eggs with chili mayo in the burger. So pull up those sleeves, loosen that belt and get ready for a chow down!"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Been a while since I've been to any Bachi Burger, but it seems they changed their menu. 

They used to have a delicious burger for vegetarians. Apparently they got rid of that for some reason, and replaced it with a veggie sandwich. Really, a veggie sandwich?!? You're a burger restaurant, why would you make that switch? Fine, okay, whatever. I decided to try it and, uh...I don't know why they'd serve this thing to people. It tastes like charcoal. I tried a couple bites from a couple different sections of the sandwich, and then asked them to take this charcoal sandwich away. Definitely not a place for any vegetarians to come with friends anymore. Sad, because it used to be with the burger they got rid of.

As for the service...seems like they're understaffed. I'm hoping that's why our waitress was so unpleasant, but who can say. She didn't seem flustered, rushed, or anything like that. It just seemed like she hated customers and hated making decent tips, I guess..."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  Not the best burger I have ever had.  The truffle fries were really good.  Hubby got the Miagi-San and his was better then mine.  I got the Kiki.  Honestly a little salt goes a long way.  Needed some salt, some umami.  It's a bit pricey but the meat was cooked well and tasted of high quality."}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected.. The set up is all wrong from the lighting to the tables as we were being seated your running into the workers and customers theres no aisle room. My 10 yr old ordered a hamburger, when she took a bite she didnt like it so I mom switched burgers, when we got the bill I was shocked to see that the burger she ordered was $26 thats right my caring waitress never warned me that my 10 yr old was ordering a $26 burger, and to add to that it had a type of fish in it. The burgers that my husband and 18 yr old and me ordered were $12, thats why we let my daughter choose a burger we had no idea there was such a pricey burger and what waitress lets that happen, obviously not a caring one. Trust me this burger joint is not worth your money. I would suggest steak n shake burgers at South Point casino wayy better."}
{"text":"First time I have ever eaten here I was mesmerized how amazing and flavorful there burgers are! One day when I get married I want to order mini bachi burgers to pass around to my guests to they can taste how amazing the burgers are!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place on DDD many times and have been wanting to try it.  I finally got to try it during my recent vegas trip and it didn't disappoint.  We ordered oxtail chili cheese fries and OMG it was sooooooooooo delicious. We got a burger and it was good too,

They also combined with the ramen place next door so you can also order ramen if you want.

Try this place!"}
{"text":"We went twice in two days, so...yeah. Somehow, my mom conned me into sharing with her both nights so that she could order wimpy non-burgers and feel cute and semi-virtuous while chomping down on half of my tasty meat creations.

Visit #1 

Miyagi-san Burger - Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Onion Rings - I love all these things, especially egg, on my burgers. Yes, I love egg even more than bacon. Everything together was...well, it's turning my mouth on just thinking about it. So good. So very, very good.

Peking Duck Buns - Ordered without cilantro - The egg was a nice touch, but  eh, give me real peking duck at a Chinese restaurant.

Truffle Parmesan Fries - Love the black truffle porcini cream. I could do without the sun dried tomato aioli, though. Just give my heathen self regular ketchup.

Going again the next night was actually not my idea, but I had no objections.

Visit #2

Kiki's Burger - Shiitake, Enoki, & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Gruyere, Garlic Chili Aioli - I love mushrooms and cheese, so I thought I might like this more than the Miyagi-san. It was fantastic, but the Miyagi-san was way better.

Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Again, ordered without cilantro - Honestly, I know it's trendy, but I am just not into ordering these Chinese bun items at restaurants. I can slap this together at home in about 30 seconds. Exactly like the duck buns but with pork (duh). If you live in a place where you can't get Chinese pork belly I guess this would be exciting.

Salted Caramel Shake - I had sort of wanted to have this the night before and decided the second visit was a sign for me to get it. It was very good but unsurprisingly very heavy. In all honesty, I shouldn't have ordered this. It was overkill.

More Truffle Parmesan Fries!

Because we went pretty late at night, there was no wait. Service was okay. In my crosshairs for future visits are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (several eaters needed) and Shogun Burger (Foie Gras my love!). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends on a Sunday afternoon. Our wait was maybe 20 minutes, impressive with the amount of people that were in the restaurant. 

Wait staff was efficient, drinks were filled promptly, and the food was incredible. 

I'm not a burger fan, so I opted for the ox tail fries. By the look on my server's face I knew I made a good decision. 

The fries were crisp, the toppings were just perfect, and the meat was nice and tender. It was a great flavor combination. 

Not being a burger fan I probably won't be coming back here often, but would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a tasty, filling meal."}
{"text":"Do not miss this stop in Vegas. The best burger I have ever eaten. The Wagyu burger is amazing."}
{"text":"Although the burgers are freest, I feel like the apps might be better! Pork belly steam buns are to die for and the calamari is fantastic!  Another high note was the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake. It is probably the best milkshake I've ever had, it's seriously that good!  If your too full after your meal at least get one to go and drink it later, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Looking forward to a different take on burgers especially after the positive reviews on Yelp and being on the best burger top 10 list. Food was ok. However, service was awful. Inattentive, disinterested wait staff, french fries came out five minutes after burgers and we had to ask servers multiple times for ketchup."}
{"text":"I must admit, one of the best burgers i've had! Also a must try, pork belly steamed bun! Everything was amazing... Truffle fries & oxtail chili fries! Added plus was the great service we had from Ashley. Definitely stop by this place!"}
{"text":"Bachi burger never fails! My favorite is the Mr. Ho's burger and a taro boba. The Bachi pickles and truffle parmesan fries are a must as well!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good.  Tried both the wagyu and Angus.  They use sweet buns made by a local baker, similar to Hawaiian rolls.  The burgers were juicy but didn't fall apart. The patty was cooked medium as asked and various toppings were interesting.   The fries were thin, crisp, and pleasantly under salted so when dipped in pineapple ketchup they were great!  Prices were reasonable.   
Where they fail is at the seating and dealing with guests at the first point of contact.   Half the restaurant was empty but had to wait close to 30 minutes.   Very inexperienced hostess and manager. I HOPE they were inexperienced because if they were.....Having run very busy restaurants in NYC, their reason that they were under staffed was somewhat true but inexcusable because it happened both times I dined there.  Note to the owner-visit your restaurant more often,  now your only under performing by 25 percent but when you get some decent competition it'll be too late.
Simply,  food is good but I'm not going back."}
{"text":"The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are amazing, so many wonderful flavors and textures on hot fries, bomb! I'm from Hawaii, so I love Teriyaki burgers... the Ronin did not disappoint, oishii! The best Asian fusion burger I've had. The Pb Chocolate Souffle is oozing with warm chocolate and peanut butter with vanilla ice cream, oh baby! I will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"I had Miyagi-San's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger..best burger ever (See the pic I added to Yelp)!! Also the Parmesan & Sweet Potato Fries were a winner at our table. The garlic fries were ok but nothing great. If I only had one minor complaint it's that they need more space overall (tables, chairs, bathroom, etc)."}
{"text":"Amazing! 

Went straight from the airport to getting our grub on. Everyone said to get the ronin (beef, sweet onion marmalade, cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, bbq and citrus aioli) which don't get me wrong was delicious but the Mr. ho's (beef, pork, sautéed mushrooms, lap cheong on taro bun) was my preferred. The flavor in both burgers had my taste buds going out of control! 

Don't forget to order the oxtail chili cheese fries... Addicting!"}
{"text":"About a 20 minute drive from Downtown Vegas. Service was excellent and the oxtail chili cheese fries were really tasty with a little kick to it. I liked these fries more than the truffle Parmesan fries. Truffle fries were a bit bland and weren't anything special. The Miyagi-San burger was really tasty and the sauce was similar to that of kalbi. Yum!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food here. The oxtail chili cheese fries are addicting. I would recommend getting that with anything you order here. The kiki (mushroom) burger I had was very good and the Mr. Ho's burger I had a few bites of was also tasty. The strawberry lemonade was delicious, though I'm not sure why they can't just hook it up with at least one refill.

The main thing that detracted from the whole dining experience here was the service. There were a billion empty tables (I am exaggerating but there were a LOT), but we still had to wait 5-10 minutes even when there was nobody in those seats. Also, I felt like we were getting pushed out the whole time. We hadn't had a chance to look over the menus for more than 10 seconds when the waitress wanted our order. The bill also came without asking for it while we still had a third of our burgers left and the food was cleared away before we could tell them to stop. The timing of the service is just really off here."}
{"text":"Food was good as expected based on the reviews. Interesting menu.  We were quite Disappointed the Sahara location does not offer happy hour as advertised so had an early dinner instead. They need more staff even in the afternoon to provide adequate service."}
{"text":"Use to be great place continual goes down never enough help
Charge 4 to 5 for lemonade  then wants to charge again for refill .
Owners forgot when they first started very involved  demand good service from staff etc. last time for me today"}
{"text":"Just okay. Garlic fries had ginger and parsley on them which gave it a weird flavor. Lamb burger was warm in the middle - not piping hot like it should be when it's fresh off the grill. Uncomfortable seats. We thought it was too pricey for what they serve"}
{"text":"Food was good and service by Jared was excellent!  Jared recommended a great beer and was very personable. Hope he gets to go visit Seattle."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy was this place great. Seems like a hole in the wall but the Wagyu burger is out of this world. So juicy and delicious. I want to come back to Vegas just to have another one. We also share a plate of chili fries and wow were those amazing as well. Fried egg on top was icing on the cake! I would rank this as on of the top 3 burgers I've ever had and I've had a lot of burgers. Definitley worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to the delicious no-meat burger I read about online and I was very disappointed to learn they got rid of it. Won't be back unless this comes back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and constantly come back every time I'm in Vegas! I always have a hard time deciding which burger to get cuz they're all good but I think my favorite is between the Kiki and Ronin. The truffle fries are DELICIOUS too!

I honestly was not too fond of the oxtail fries... It was a more heavy dish. Their version of a chili cheese fries. But they have soooo many great dishes I still think they deserve a five star! ^^"}
{"text":"I got the Pork Loco Moco, and it was delicious. It came with a side of mac salad, which was okay. My friend had gotten the Miyagi-San and it looked amazing. Our waiter was Adrian who was super attentive, filled our water and had great conversation with us. Great experience."}
{"text":"Believe the low-ranking reviews.

The good: Our hostess was a total sweetheart. She should escape this place for a better gig.

The food tasted great! The pickles were really good. 

The bad: We waited about an hour after placing our order. It wasn't even busy. They served one of our party way way earlier than the rest of us. I ordered the bahn mi burger and it didn't have any of the ingredients that  make it a bahn mi burger. They ended up comping me the burger, but given that they got so much else wrong, it didn't matter.

If our hostess reads this, escape while you can. You are so much better than this place!"}
{"text":"The place has got great burgers but they have real bad service and walk in and there can be eight people in there and they say there's a 10 minute wait they need to fix that because they really do have great burgers other than that we won't come again until they fix it you need to talk to the management about this. We have been at this place at least 10 times always great food but we walked out three times because of the service and the slowness management needs to step up"}
{"text":"Third time here.  Food great. Service is fucking awful.  Doubt I'll be back. 

Case in point. 

Tonight I arrived five minutes before my wife and son. I asked for a table as I wanted to settle down and have a beer. Hostess, even though there was over four tables (four tips) open, would not allow me to sit. She said, \"go to the bar.\"  I don't want to go to the bar, I want to order a beer at a table as my family is right behind. \"Well, we don't have enough servers.\"  Really?  Then who served the table as soon as my wife arrived. Horrible service, and even worse: attitude, from the hostess. 

Hostess is the front line and if they are not \"people persons,\" you're dead. They are dead!

As soon as we sat down, we thought there were pieces of chips, or something, on the table and tried to wipe them away. Wrong! It was chips of paint out of the table. Bad appearance, and in showbiz or restaurant biz, appearance IS EVERYTHING.  Bus boy said everyone is complaining about the appearance and we should let managment know. We didn't see management and with their issues that is quite evident. Maybe THEY are the issue. 

It gets worse. 

My son orders a burger with fries and a Coke. My wife orders a veggie burger the pickle plate with a beer. I order soba noodles and foie gras for the appetizer, and a draft beer. 

Burger comes out, soba and veggie burger.  Five minute later, the fries come out and foie gras. My son had already eaten his burger. My soup sat as I waited.

Nothing is organized or detail oriented. 

We ask for another beer. Ten minutes later it arrives. 

To their credit, they didn't bill us for the apps as they arrived after dinner.

Food quality good. But the service failures are too much and the attitude in a service business is beyond comprehension. This place is simply mismanaged and no attention to detail. 

I'll find a place with food just as good and better energy and less attitude. 

NEXT!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of great burgers on the West Coast. LA and Vegas are gourmet burger kings of the West with multicultural influences. This place has been on my bookmark list forever. I frequent Vegas but don't care to spend $50 for a cab just to try places beyond the strip. Done that a few times before. This time around, we drove in and from a long evening of driving we craved burgers. 

We were seated 10 minutes  upon arrival. This place was packed for a Friday evening with NBA playoff games being shown from the many flatscreen tvs. I scoured thru the menu hungry and found what I wanted... Miyagi-san's grass fed wagyu burger and a glass of iced matcha green tea. This burger reminds me a bit of Holstein's Rising Sun which is one of my favorites. 

This burger is delicious. The patty is delicious with a baste of teriyaki sauce. It has great flavor with the creamy slight kick of the chili mayo, sweet and slight saltiness of the furikake, textures and caramelized backon and crispy onion rings. My two other sidekicks had the Ronin Burger and Kiki's Burger which they thought were just okay. 

The ice green tea was just okay. A bit on the water down side. Expected as it was unlimited refills. Wish they has a simple syrup to sweeten it up instead of dumping 5 sugars in there not dissolving properly. 

Worth another visit for me to try other items. A must stop if you're driving in and stopping by Vegas."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype and stellar reputation. After I saw them on an episode of Triple D, a visit to Bachi was highly warranted during my recent visit last week to Vegas. They're located 7 miles west of the Las Vegas Blvd. on Sahara Ave inside a huge shopping center. Though a little ways from strip, it's not far of a drive and took us about 15 minutes to get here.

We arrived mid-afternoon on Saturday and were seated fairly quickly, waiting only 5 minutes for our table. The place presents a casual, laid-back atmosphere with a modern feel that compliments their unique Asian fusion style menu. You can choose from a variety of gourmet type burgers or simply build your own; and compared to most high end burger joints, prices are reasonable considering the quality of food you receive.

For starters, we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and pork belly steamed buns which came highly recommended by our server -

Oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) - this top selling item was awesome and delicious. The chili really makes this dish standout so flavorful, sweet and spicy. Using oxtail instead of traditional ground beef adds richness and appropriate texture to the chili, complimenting the light crisp fries. I love the way the egg yolk oozes over the chili when you break into it. It felt like I was eating luxurious French boudin fries. Very savory and exquisite.

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HzPMWDKQZw-5RjpfUICxRA&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg

Pork belly steamed buns ($10) - Thick cuts of pork belly nestled inside 3 soft pillowy buns and amped up with a boiled egg for the ultimate deliciousness was scrumptious.  The perfect foundation for any great Asian bun. You get a nice balance of sweet and tanginess from Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin which works well with pork and vegetables.

I've eaten a lot of good burgers and I'm amazed to say that these have got to be the best I have eaten anywhere, including some in LA. The buns on both of these dishes were huge, and presentation was great. We ended up ordering the Bachi and Miyagi-San Wagyu burger which were both well crafted and on point -

Miyagi-San Wagyu Burger ($15) - infused with Furikake seasoning and priced a few dollars more, this kobe beef quality patty was freaking delicious. It was cooked perfectly medium with a nice crust and pink in the middle. Of course, you can't go wrong with a fried egg which to be the norm nowadays. It offers a buttery, rich flavor that makes the basis for any tasty burgers.

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5KMqeSMu9yyz5gO8BWUR-w&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg

Bachi burger ($13) - It came with standard lettuce, tomato, and red onion. For $4.50 more it was upgraded with apple wood smoked bacon, shredded onions and cheddar cheese ($1.50 each extra for each item). The burger was juicy, tender and so good! Everything held together nicely without getting to messy. Each bite was heavenly.

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=otpbLYzI-V5l-W4fXALoag&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg

To wash it down, we ordered the salted/caramel shake ($6) with toasted marshmallows. It was smaller portion than we're used to seeing (maybe 12 oz glass), but very delicious. They have wonderful selection of craft beers and premium sake, which added to our yummy the dining experience. The 22 oz Sapporo Draft ($6) paired well with the beer and chili fries.

All in all, this restaurant did not disappoint. Service was excellent, the atmosphere was cheerful and the food was remarkable. Triple D was dead on with this one. It is a bit out of the way, but definitely worth the drive. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers...period! Just had the pork belly bun, amazing! And the oxtail  chili cheese fries are scrumdeliumtious!! The service needs some work. Our server only came to our table 3 times and our water was empty longer than I liked. But overall, awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a different flavor burger.  Love the asian flavors.  Came here with my gf, server was nice, friendly, and provide details about which burgers we should get.  Fries were very nicely decorated and tasted wonderful, but a bit overpriced.  I'm seeing that they opened a second location in Summerlin.  

Place was very clean and parking is easy."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get it? I wanted a tasty burger it was bland! 
This is the loudest restaurant I have ever been in there is no acoustic muffling, in an attempt to be cool all the surfaces are hard surfaces hard chairs hard tables concrete floor exposed ceiling --- all that stuff echoes the noise making it louder 
The service was slow the waiter kinda mumbles and because of the noise level I had to ask him to repeat every other word. I know he said something about one of the items being featured on some tv show (who cares just bring me food) 
Ordered our burgers and some chili fries. The chili was very sweet and the I fries where very salty, if you ate them at the same time it worked but either one by themselves was not good 
The burger (angus) was very bland and slightly undercooked (medium) no char to the outside no seasoning in the burger just plain beef cooked halfass add two half strips of bacon for $2.50 and it had no flavor at all didn't get the slightest hint of bacon over the bland burger the bun was very light and fluffy, might have been good but it was coated in some oily goo 
My wife ordered some lichi (spelling?) drink she said it was bland too no real flavor her burger was ordered with some spicy sauce and jalapeño slices neither had much flavor so she asked for hot sauce and was given \"chili water\" waiter said it was made with ghost peppers again no zip finally the brought some shirachi sauce but by that time she was over the place 
Good points 
Presentation was nice, food was plentiful 
Cons 
Slow service, tooo noisy, bland food, over priced and NOISY
One drink two burgers one chili fries $50 ----- ouch"}
{"text":"Big ups to my ninja, Reid.  I'd be down to donate blood to you, you iron deficient sumbitch.  I promise it'll make you smarter, faster, stronger, but won't increase the length or girth of your.....sentences?

If you're a strict cheeseburger purist, I got one thing to say to you, put an egg in your shoe and beat it.  This place puts an asian touch on burgers (I use the term 'touch' because the term 'fusion' should only be used when speaking about coitus).

Ok, so I'm only going to talk (type up) about the burgers only.  It's Friday and I don't feel like doing anything and I'm sure you don't feel like reading any more than you have to.  I'm glad we have agreed upon this arrangement.  Let's shake on it to make it official.

The Ronin Burger is aptly named.  The Ronin were samurai with no lord back in the day.  In this case, think of the patty as the Samurai.  Even with all the ingredients used in describing this burger, it stood alone.  No master, or in this case, ingredient to follow.  Not a bad thing.  The burger was still good.  Though description of it would lead you to think it was going to be layered with different flavors and whatnot.

The Kalbi burger is like eating Korean BBQ in burger form.  And much like eating the actual Korean BBQ, you'll be burping this up all the way home on that picturesque drive on the 15 southbound.  I would've never have thought about putting kimchee in a burger.  This was better executed than Sadam Hussein was.  You know, with his head all on the ground rolling around and whatnot.

I'll take a couple of those Portuguese donuts for the road. Thanks."}
{"text":"First meal of our short vegas trip.  Really good prepared asian fusion burgers.  I had the Kiki burger which was a sweet and spicy burger.  My wife had the kalbi burger.  Burgers are made perfect and very tasty and filling.  We also tried the truffle parmesan fries.  They make their own sodas as well.  Nice place south of the strip and airport and great hours open late.  Would do well in the bay area"}
{"text":"Came here because of all the great reviews. Tried the Ox Tail Fries, the Mr. Ho burger, and the Miso Burger. Everything was really good. Everyone at my table thought that the Mr. Ho burger was the best. Would and will come back."}
{"text":"Love to eat here.  Friendly service and good food.  Veggie gyoza is very tasty! Of course the burgers are awesome!  Make it a destination when you want something different!"}
{"text":"I would give Bachi Burger an overall 3.5. The food is very good, but a bit overpriced. We waited almost 30 minutes to be seated, because it was the end of the lunch rush and they had empty tables that needed to be cleaned. The servers were friendly and helpful with suggestions. I'll go back when I am craving a not so standard burger and fries."}
{"text":"Damn, what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. 

I'm genuinely surprised to see this place pop up on the little thing that suggests which reviews I should write. I've been going to this place since it's soft opening and have been in love ever since. 

From the get go, Kiki's burger has been my favorite. I mean, anything with a fried egg is going to win my heart. But, recently they have had this manga burger which is soo good. It comes with the dynamite on it, which just add soo much flavor. The fries are good. The service is good. The drinks are good. Everything is just great. 

I'll never stop going here and I'll never stop recommending it to my friends. They have since opened a second location, which I have not been to. Hopefully it's just as great as the original."}
{"text":"I'm so obsessed with Bachi Burger that I got my friends obsessed with it too. My sister visited me and she loved it so much that we went here two days in a row... Wow, that's just another level of embarrassing, dedication, love and obesity. I'm glad the staff was different!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!

I am drooling just thinking about it.

Ordered the ox-tail fries and kiki burger and both were really amazing!

Fries portion was seriously enough for 3 people and burger was well portioned too! 

The sweet perfectly baked bun and Asian fusion flavors of the burger really were really spectacular and my taste buds were going crazy, YUM YUM YUM! The sauteed mushrooms and carmelized bacon marmalade were a perfect touch!

Service could definitely use some work as the servers weren't that attentive or seemed happy at all. But the food was amazing enough to let me look pass that!

Once the LA location in California opens up I'll definitely be visiting!"}
{"text":"Wow.. Wow.. how can you not loved this place!
We're from Long Beach California.. this is our first time to this location, have me to another also.
Overall just Love Love this place!!! 
The oxtail chili fries.. Oh my goodness!! 5 stars by it self.. the burgers are off the hook too.. so different but very tasteful.. Service was great too! 
Thank You for your place.. Great infused food.. 
love it !!!"}
{"text":"New Summerlin location is close to my house and is right by the movie theatre so makes it a great spot for date night with my wife.  Every time I go, though, it never seems to be very busy?  Either way, I have yet to be disappointed with the food here, or the service for that matter.  

Banh Mi burger is fantastic, and what I get time and time again. I've been here about 5 times and the food is always consistent.  Burgers come out perfect, fries are crispy, appetizers arrive promptly, and the service is solid.  Some people will nitpick this place to death, but it's a really simple concept that's done well.

5 stars for a local restaurant with good food and service."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger CURIOUS. I've been wanting to try Bachi for the past two years and never tried it until now finally. Marking it off my list makes me want more.. The unique twist on the menu caught my eye and the flavor combinations are enlightening. I came by last night for dinner and the wait time was decent, not too long maybe about 15 minutes or so. The inside is very clean, modern and at the same time casual and trendy. They offer a wide array of burger selections and even have a menu for those who prefer ramen. The server was very attentive and the service here is excellent!

DRINK: Red Sangria 

FOOD: 
-PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS
-OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES 
-MIYAGI-SAN'S BURGER 

The Sangria was very excellent as it was very fruity, lush, and boozy. 

The fries were on the top of my bucket list to try here. It was fun to try and tasty at the same time, but pretty much like chili cheese fries.. could have had more oxtail meat with it (you know what I mean carne asada fry lovers?!) 

I recommend the pork belly steamed buns, they were savory and took the first few bites without the sauce it was fine both ways. 

As for the burger (wagyu beef ,? chili mayo,? fried egg, ?furikake, caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings).. it was very satisfying and has everything I crave thus matching my taste buds quite well. It was definitely full of so many flavors and cooked just how I wanted it (medium well). To be honest I was stuffed though from my appetizers, so I only ate a small fraction of it. The next day this burger still tasted great.. as I ate it as leftovers for lunch today.  

Come here for a wide variety of asian fusion inspired eats and find a special drink to enhance each bite!~"}
{"text":"Came back again and waited for about half an hour... But still worth the wait. This time I took my other half and she was glad I took her!"}
{"text":"I think that a big downfall for a lot of places is when there is a lot of hype and it than sets very high expectations- exactly what happened for me. We got lunch on sunday afternoon in a group of 5 and waited maybe about 45 minutes for our table so not too crazy. So glad to be sat down and given cold waters haha we all ooh'd and aah'd over the menu. Everything on there sounds darn near perfect! Such an unique play on flavors, I love Asian fusion. Sadly, I don't think it was executed as well as it could have been though.  

Truffle Parmesan Fries: the fries themselves were good, pretty skinny and crispy which is how we like them. However, you can't even taste the truffle on them and the porcini cream sauce on top wasn't too great. They serve a chili garlic aioli on the side that was tasty though.
Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: generous portion for the 5 of us to have shared. The first few bites were DELICIOUS! The more it cooled down, the sweeter it got so we weren't a fan of that. I was thinking there would be kind of chunky pieces of oxtail meat but it was in tiny shreds so im not sure I really got that flavor profile. 
Miyagi-San burger: Wagyu burger with chili mayo, fried egg, FURIKAKE, crispy onion strings, and CARAMELIZED BACON. Sounds heavenly right? All the flavors complimented each other perfectly especially since I added gruyere. I did finds myself wishing I had also added some arugula to cut through some of the richness. My complaint about the burger would have to be that I had ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty well do- burnt on the edges well done. Our server had been pretty attentive prior but hadn't come back around so I just ended up eating half my burger and getting full...

Other than that, the Taro bun that one of the burgers came on was great! My friend got the Shogun which has unagi, pan seared foie gras, etc and he felt that It didn't taste like it was worth the $26 it was. The pineapple iced tea was addicting but there aren't free refills so savor it if you don't want to pay for another round! I woulddd come back but don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers!  First bite to its last..very tasty and moist.  A very good combinations of flavors.  More of an Asian flair but I'm sure you could improvise it if Asian is not your choice.  Our friends introduced this place to us and now it's a must stop whenever we're in Las Vegas.  Must try all the other items on their menu.  Their servings are pretty big, the burger melts in your mouth that you could possibly finish all of it.  Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Great place! We were on the strip, but wanted a change of scenery. What a great find. Our waitress Mindy provided us with some great recommendations. The oxtail fries with the fried egg - AMAZING! Can't wait to come back to LV to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I am giving a 3* review despite the food tasting fantastic, because of the service.

I have eaten here before and it was the same situation; food tastes great but service is average.

This time, it was no exception; the icing on the cake was when my Lonely Bird entree arrived, j asked the waiter whether or not hey had some sort of mayo or aioli mayo. He said they have garlic aioli but he will have to charge me extra; I was like \"you cannot be serious, right?\" His reply was (read this as you can imagine the tone) \"oh yes, I am very serious. We make it in house and it is extra\". 

I asked \"how much?\" His reply was \"it is 50 cents\"!!!!!!!!!!! 50 cents when I was buying over $60 lunch!! (I had two other people with me)!!! FIFTY CENTS! He had the gull to charge me fifty cents for a tiny bit of aioli...

Terrible business praxcic"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh! I normally get a burger and will split a fry with a friend or family member. I have been here a few time and never gotten something I didn't like. I highly recommend for someone who wants an upgraded burger."}
{"text":"The Skinny: great steamed buns, great fries (4), service - better wait time for food (3), value - good on the sandwich prices (3).

We decided to brave this place for a second time. We were glad we did. After our previous review where the wait time was well over 30 minutes, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our food - a vast improvement. 

I don't know if it is the timing however we did get there around noon on a holiday Monday. Roughly the same number of tables were there. We did have the same server as the last time and she did a much better job today.

This time we tried the Lonely Bird (a tsukune sandwich), the steamed pork belly sandwiches and their garlic, salt& pepper fries.

I really love tsukune (ground chicken with shiso leaf) and this sandwich really nailed it with the flavours of the shiso aioli. The fear with most ground turkey/chicken burgers is dryness. However Bachi proves that it is not the case. The patty was juicy and delicious. Texturally, it was well balanced with the nice crunch of the onion rings.

The pork belly was a melt-in-your-mouth, succulent slice of heaven encased in a wonderfully, fluffy steamed bun. The mild acidity of the vegetables really cut through the pork's richness. Truly a well thought out dish.

Finally, the garlic, salt & pepper fries were very nice - crispy, salty with a hint of heat from jalapenos. Perfection and yes, very addicting.

I would definitely come again to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Today was the second time we ate at this place and I'm still a fan. For a Saturday mid-afternoon, it was pretty busy. The place is pretty decent, good for intimate 643-8 people. The servers were really friendly. 
I introduced my friends to this place and each one of us got the Ronin burger. Perfect serving size to not overwork the kidneys. Although, I was bummed that when I requested to cook the eggs over-easy, the chef said no. That would have been delish! The yolk oozing out....I know.. weird.  The truffle fries were ok. I know right? Chocolate + fries = hmmm..Something I still need to get used to. Also, try the hot green tea. Will definitely aid with digestion:).
The bf was the only one that ordered the Kiki's burger and he only ate half; he was definitely FULL which is rare. 
The first time we ate here, I got the Kalbi burger, which is also yummy but I prefer the Ronin burger. 
Oh, and if you crave for this place on a random Saturday night (midnight-ish) come early or ORDER ASAP! When we called last Saturday, they ran out of buns due to high volume! We were pretty disappointed last night and settled for In & Out."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. I got the Miyagi burger and the bachi fish. Come here to get food! I definitely recommend! Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I guess I'm truly in the minority on this place.  So many of my Yelp friends gave it rave reviews that I was really excited to try this place when my friend was in town in March.

(It was also one of the only places that you could get boba at 10pm.)

So we go inside and there's a strange mix of smells.  At first you're like, \"Oh, this is different\" and I try to associate different with good, but the smells change and you're like, \"Hmm, not sure if good\" with a confused look on your face.  I think the servers are trained to ignore that look, because I caught a couple of people who walked through the door doing the same thing.

It was pretty busy when we went but I could see at least a handful of tables clean.  We still waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  We almost walked out but boba was the main goal so we stuck it out and sat down.

Waiter was OK.  Definitely not exceptional.  He wasn't thrilled when we first ordered waters and boba.  The boba was slow to come out and wasn't really boba... definitely wasn't 5-star worthy in any way shape or form.

I decided to suck it up and order an appetizer - their oxtail chili cheese fries.  Sure, why not.  They were decent, but certainly nothing to go crazy over.  And the sunny-side up egg on it was just...no.  Didn't really fit anything.  That's kind of how I felt about the whole menu, though - trying to be hipster and cool with all their \"weird pairings\" that didn't make sense unless you were also hipster and cool.  I dunno.  I'll eat damn near anything, but 95% of the menu sounded weird, ridiculous, or both.

And because of that, they feel like they can charge exorbitant prices.  $12 for chili cheese fries?  Ox is NOT that expensive of a meat, so sorry, I don't buy that.

We paid our tab for half-eaten fries and sub-par boba.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Extremely good burgers, inspired sides. If you're looking for a fun and unusual gourmet burger experience, this place is it. We first ate here in 2010 and loved the experience, and had to come back - each burger or sandwich we try is even better than the last. 

One thing that impresses me about the food here is the obvious care and attention placed on the ingredients and preparation. Even something as \"simple\" as the Bachi Pickle Assortment (just $3, be sure to try it) has been house made with extreme attention to detail and flavor. When you spend 15 minutes trying to puzzle out the umami of a pickle plate, you know you're in a great restaurant.

Two stand-out out burgers are the Ronin ($8) and the KiKi ($8). 

The Ronin has carmelized onions, Japanese slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Kastu BBQ and Yuzy Citrus Aioli, all topped off with a fried egg. 

The Kiki is dressed with a garlic chili aoli and comes topped with caramelized bacon (so amazing), sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, a sweet onion marmalade and melty Gruyere cheese. 

Burgers always arrive perfectly cooked, but just BE SURE to ask for medium rare or they'll cook them past medium - and these burgers SHINE at medium rare.

It's a bit of a bummer that the burgers don't come with plain fries - you have to order those on the side ($3) but the gourmet fries, such as the Truffle Parmesan ($4) are totally worth the extra cost - smothered in Parmesan Reggiano, black truffle Porcini cream, and sun dried tomato aioli, they're a must-not-miss side item.

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns & the That's Cheesy sammies are also  outstanding. You really can't go wrong with anything you'd order here.

I also appreciate their amazing drink offerings -  lovely boba drinks & shakes, incredible sodas (love the apple lychee, calamansi lime & cherry yuzu) and really great teas, such as the Mugi-Cha Barley Tea.  If you like coffee, try the Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee, it's fantastic.

The only negative comment I have is I do have to agree with other Yelpers regarding the service; it is slow and sometimes disorganized; don't be surprised if you have to wait to be seated, then wait to have your order taken, then wait for your food .... but just order a lovely dessert special and some coffee; at least that will take your mind off the long wait for the bill."}
{"text":"Definitely a must if you're in the area. Burgers are awesome. Made to your liking. The different varieties of burgers is amazing, but decided to build my own, and I must say, it was an absolute winner! The oxtail fries is also unreal, very tasty, and the portion size is great for 3 people. The plantation iced tea is probably the best I have tasted. The blend of pineapple and mint, makes it taste perfect, very thirst quenching!"}
{"text":"My friends and I just left this place and can I just say.....SO GOOD! I had the No Meat burger and the Just fries. They were very tasty. They shared the Ox tail fries and they said that they were very delicious and the meat was very tender. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. It is a bit of a wait but for sure worth it."}
{"text":"Beware of the service here on weekends. Yes, you drove your asses all the way over here and now there's a 45-75 min wait. But you know what? The food is amazing and they know it. And they will use that to their advantage.

The hostess really knows how to make your experience a shitty one. No smiles, very stern voice, and absolutely no common sense. We had to wait next to an empty table for 4 for about 30 min while she was \"building a table\" for a bigger party. There was no, \"Sorry for the wait\" or \"Thanks for your patience\". But once you get past her incompetence, it's smooth sailing from there.

Food is great, you MUST order the oxtail chili fries. That is the only reason I will put up with the crappy hostess. I've tried most of the burgers and they have all been mouth watering. The best part is that each burger will come with their own little surprise that will have you asking, \"Excuse me, what is this, and what is it for?\" You'll understand when you see it."}
{"text":"The Burgers here are definitely different but very delicious! My husband loves burgers more than me and this is one of his favorite spots. This is a great bday feast idea and we went there this year for his 33 bday. The staff was very nice and gave him some extra sweet potato fries (his fav)."}
{"text":"I so wanted to try the oxtail chili fries, but we had too much on order already.  I got the 8 oz grassfed burger, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat at Bachi because of the good things I had heard about the food. 
Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The burgers weren't spectacular or even good. I tried the soup and that was also subpar. I would have paid double for a great meal. 
I'm always up for a culinary adventure... I went in with an empty stomach and open mind! Bachi Burger fell short of that."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Las Vegas and I've heard good things about Bachi Burger from relatives so I decided to spend my birthday dinner here. I honestly should have went somewhere else with the amount of money spent. We showed up around 8:30pm and the place was reasonably busy. We placed our order around 8:45pm (burgers and fries). The burgers came out a little over an hour later. Not only did we wait an unreasonable amount of time for our burgers, my burger was not cooked as I requested therefor I had to wait longer. Also, the fries did not come out until 20 minutes after we received our burgers and they were cold on top of that! Sadly, with my experience with Bachi Burger tonight, I will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was not for me. I had to run to the restroom to vomit after eating the pickled appetizer plate. My burger was equally as disgusting. The service was horrible. We had 4 different people waiting on us and nobody seemed to know what was going on with our food. We waited for about 50 minutes for our burgers and there was only 4 other tables in there. The lighting was so bright, it gave me a migraine- no joke. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my place for my once a week cheat meal. My mission is to try everything on the menu. So far i havent been dissapointed. I always start with a beer followed by some fries and the main event the burger! Today i had the oxstail fries.. So good and BIG, i always get the pineaple ketchup on the side. For the main dish today i did the miyagis sans burger, that wagyu beef is so tender!! I really enjoyed my time here, very good service and excellent food.. Really looking forward to my next cheat meal !!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a friday night, the wait wasn't long. As a vegetarian I was disappointed that my only option was the No Meat Here...\"Burger\" but it looked pretty good, so I gave it a go along with a side of fries. When my \"burger\" came out it was verryyy high and I felt way to overwhelmed to eat it. But I was starving so I cut it in half (which I think if you decide to order this burger just ask them to do it for you, much cleaner) and after just my first bite I was hooked! I was nervous that mushroom patty, eggplant and tofu would be too much but it was the exact opposite. Every item in the burger was a perfect compliment and I loved it! 

Also Bachi Burger has a yelp check in special of buy one beer get one free! The only thing is, its for after 11pm but the incredibly attractive manager was kind enough to give it to me since I was an out of towner. Even our waiter and the serving staff were extremely friendly and made sure we enjoyed our meal. So you have great food & service, don't think about it give it a try!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we came here and we went in and got sat down in about 4 minutes which was great. However , it took them about 15 minutes to approach our table and ask us for our drink order. I would understand if they were busy running around, but when I see the servers walking around aimlessly or texting/on their cell phones in the kitchen it makes it unacceptable. 
It was kind of embarrassing that another family of 4 complained (before I had the chance to) asking where the server was as they had been waiting for 15 minutes as well to get approached. 
Once we finally got a server to come to our table we made sure to order all at once so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. 
The actual burgers were good. But again we didn't get approached the entire time we ate, or get a refill of our waters, and when the server finally came back I asked for the check and she then asked if we wanted a refill of water...but at that point it was too late and we just wanted to leave. The service was so terrible we definitely won't be coming back. Very bad experience.."}
{"text":"Their burgers are really really good. They have malasada. Delicious desserts. Vietnamese coffee and boba!! Alcohol of course. Explore the menu because there are a lot of goodies. A LOT."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was great and atmosphere was inviting.  That being said, it wasn't my cup of tea when it came to the burger I ordered.  They get 4 stars because I will go back and try other things but I'm more of a plain ol good beef and cheese type burger guy.  These are a bit too gourmet for my taste but I can see why they are popular and I'd recommend for anyone to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Don't order the manga burger. The scallops inside are completely uncooked. It is stinky. Maybe ppl who prefer raw scallops would like it. It mad me wanna throw up"}
{"text":"This burger joint was decent. Saw some reviews on yelp and discovered it was a food network favorite-pulled over to check it out on the fly. 
The Asian fusion burgers definitely have a uniqueness to them.  My burger was fresh & moderately decent, not excellent in taste. The garlic fries were basic.  
Nice vibe in the restaurant with modern seating."}
{"text":"Love this place. The menu is a well thought out fusion of flavors. With this place, fusion is not just a gimmick, it's delicious. Everything I've tried has been great but I'm willing to keep at it and try more menu items until I've exhausted all possibilities.

You gotta appreciate that they started here in Las Vegas. Usually we import culinary talent and restaurants, but here's a good example of us exporting it.

Side note: the steamed bao sandwiches are yummy but are best as an appetizer and not an entree. They are more like 3 mini bao tacks than a sandwich. Luckily we over ordered so I wasn't expecting that to fill me up."}
{"text":"1. Get everything with wagyu beef if you can. You can taste the difference.
2. Focus on the burger and tackle the sides after
3. In a group? Split the burgers so you could taste everything
4. Don't come in with large group and expect for immediate seating
5. Ask the server any question. They don't bite."}
{"text":"I Recommend: Pork buns! Kimchi burger! Their beers and wine! 

I Con: I wasn't very fond of the Duck buns and the Bahn mi burger because the flavors didn't work for me. I feel that duck needs to be cooked perfectly or else it has a strong flavor that lingers in an unwelcoming way. The Bahn mi burger didn't taste anything like bahn mi and didn't represent the Vietnamese cuisine as well.

Overall, this burger joint is a must eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the iced tea , don't recommend it, it taste like water . Ordered 2 burgers, and a side of sweet potato fries since they don't come with you meal . .. No tomatoe on both burgers and they both came with it. My burger fell apart and was a mess,,, wouldn't even stay together and the bread for so soggy ... Granted there was a fried egg on it. For 2 burgers for fifty bucks it just wasn't worth it for the service/taste of the food. Would not recommend this place and will not be returning"}
{"text":"Best burger joint ever! Customer service was fantastic!!! Can't get over how great the food was. If you go I recommend getting the Oxtail Chilli Cheese Fries! I could eat those for the rest of my life.."}
{"text":"They do take their sweet ass time making these burgers.  I would at least block out an hour if your going here even for a party of three.  Yes...they are friendly.  

The menu is creative but when it gets busy....it gets real busy and their service level goes out the window.  Look forward to checking out their other location next time."}
{"text":"This place consistently lied to me about wait times and never mentioned how long ordering to serving would take until we had already committed more than an hour of waiting time. 

The fact that they had tables available in their side room and patio that they didn't have enough servers for was astonishing. Bad business practices. And being told it would take 40 minutes for food to be served after we had already waited an hour was very upsetting.

Go to this place at your own risk, I will warn you in case they don't."}
{"text":"So disappointed! We've gone to all Bachi locations many times. This is the first time food was lacking and service was slow, when there was hardly anyone inside. 

Ordered Bone marrow; there was no freakin marrow! Couldn't even fill one piece of toast. It more like a jam that they mix with marrow then place into a bone. Complained about having nothing to put on our toast, so they gave us a small dish of marrow jam, which made up for it. But I won't order it again. I want Bone marrow, not the mix they made out of it.

I usually order Kiki Burger and this was not it. Totally left out gruyere cheese, garlic aioli, & caramelized jam. It was so dry! I was wondering why it was lacking. Looked at menu and noticed they left ingredients out! I didn't bother to complain about this because we complained about our other dishes.

Bachi Loco moco with Risotto. This is usually our fave. But the Risotto wasn't cooked! Who wants to eat hard ass rice! They forgot to give us the Sriracha jam which was needed because the flavor was lacking and rice was undercooked. Had to ask for that too. We did complain about the under cooked Risotto. So they took it off out bill since we didn't eat it.

We've never had everything we ordered be crap before. We just won't go to this location again. We'll stick to the Summerlin location. So so disappointed"}
{"text":"After eating here for the 5th time (this month) I'm ready to write my review. Had I written this before today I would have given 4 stars. Today's experience: 1 star.

*General opinion*
Bachi Burger has a creative menu with a few GREAT items, and some items that have great potential but don't quite cut it.

What I love:
Ronin Burger
Miyagi-San Burger 

I definitely prefer the angus over the wagyu. Strangely, the wagyu is very lean while the angus is much juicer and more flavorful.

What I don't love:
-Oxtail Chili Fries. Sounds incredible, right? It had so much chili powder, that's all I could taste. Much too overpowering.
-Bone Marrow. They scrape the marrow out of the bone, mix it with the onion jam (?) and then put it back onto the bone. The jam has a nice flavor but that's really all I could taste. So in essence, it's just oily jam. Why go through the extra work when you can just serve the marrow in the bone with the jam on the side? 
I've tried several other dishes that were pretty good but not worth mentioning.

*Long rant*
While they have less great items than not-so-great items, the burgers I enjoy are what I keep coming back for. However, today might have been the LAST time. I'm am so thoroughly disappointed with the kitchen manager who was cooking today. The very sweet server brought my daughter's mini corn dogs out and I could see from across the room that they were overlooked. They were grayish brown with some black spots. I took a bite of one and sure enough, they were burnt to a crisp. It was so bitter with burnt taste with a charcoal-like texture. We sent it back but we couldn't have it replaced because that was the last of the mini corn dogs (btw we were the first customers of the day). Then my mother, husband, and I all started eating our burgers that we ordered medium. All 3 of us had hard, dry, beyond well-done patties. As in, the edges were burnt to a crisp and tough to chew. We kindly let our server know so she could inform her manager. Turns out, the kitchen manager was the one who was cooking. They did offer to replace them but we couldn't accept the offer because we had already been there a long time and our two toddlers wouldn't have made it another 20+ minutes. So we just ate what we could of the burnt burgers. I could only stomach 1/4 of it. My mom, half. Another sweet server came by and apologized and offered 10% off our bill. I appreciate the gesture, but 10%? Made me feel like my business doesn't matter to them. They recognized us as regulars, not some random people looking to complain and get discounts. Today, I'm ranked #1 for yelp check-ins at Bachi Burger. 10% was enough to comp one of our sodas. A much kinder gesture would have been an apology from the manager. Or maybe offer 25% off, or even just 25% off our next visit. Or a complimentary dessert. Or comp our 2 fountain sodas. Anything to make us feel like they still want us to come back. We were willing to put aside the fact that the cook HAD to know the food was burnt. It was very obvious, and a professional would definitely know. A professional would never have sent the food out that way, hoping the customer wouldn't notice. When I walked by the kitchen to the restroom there was an undeniable smell of burning food. But they didn't seem to care. So, we will likely never return."}
{"text":"Great Asian fusion burger joint for Las Vegas locals. We had the Miyagi Sans Burger (flavorful and juicy), pork belly bao (if you love Vietnamese comfort food, it hits home), and salt/pepper garlic fries...all quite delicious. I will come back to try more. It was really cold in there and only one server at the time so service was a bit slower. Also they have craft beers and boba!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on The Food Network on Guy's Diners Drive In's and Dives about a year ago and decided that whenI went back to Vegas I would give it a try. I ordered the Ronin Burger,  and it was Dee-lish! I enjoyed everything that was on that bad a## burger! The Oxtail Chili fries were the bomb.com, and the Truffle Parmesean fries were good, but not as good as the Oxtail in my opinion. I would recommend going if you want to try a burger done differently, exploding with different flavors inside your mouth :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints around! I had the Kiki Burger which was delicious and flavorful. Great ambience as well. They even offer an assortment Boba Teas and coffee. I will definitely be back to try one of them or both."}
{"text":"Here right now and there are 10 plus tables available but me and about 20 other guests have been standing here waiting at the checkin desk to be seated. There is only 1 person in the whole joint that is making an effort to work and that is the chef, a blonde girl with thick glasses. The rest are just lasting around and also arguing with, fighting and bitching this blonde chef. She seems to be the only person filling the orders. They have about 5 other people in the kitchen with her that ain't doing jack shit, moving slow, just bitching and plain old lazy.

I've been here about 30 minutes and still waiting to be seated at an empty restaurant. They purposely are not seating us because the chef is overworked right now and can't handle the existing orders from people already seated. This place is a serious unorganized shithole and the only person working looks as if she is ready to quit.

The servers are running around like chickens with the head cut off.... in an empty restaurant. I've never seen anything like it. No leadership, no moral, no team work. Just terrible. 

There is no quality of food that will bring them back from the one star that I will be leaving them."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday.   I got the burger with bacon, fried egg, cheese, onion rings, and I think a chili mayo.   Really really tasty burger.   I kinda wanted the yolk of the egg to be a little runny but it wasn't.   The flavors all together was spot on.  Burger was flavorful and tender.   Bun was a winner.   I wish it came with some fries but that's how things go.   We got the truffle garlic fries and it was enough to share with 4 people.  They were a little slow refilling sodas but other than that, the service was very good.  If I wanted a delicious burger and was feeling okay with spending $15 for it, I would definitely go to Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice now, once for his birthday party, and it's the best!!!!! Kimchi burger is money!"}
{"text":"food was really good it's a little pricy but definitely worth it. very unique menu. Great Beer selection and really good service."}
{"text":"Takes all the goodness of America, Japan, Taiwan and that other country that the US invaded and blends it into a burger form factor.   The buns on the hamburger (my waiter was a dude) are great.  they use the Taiwanese sticky buns or the peking duck Chinesey thingeys..   Best to ask them what to order vs telling them what you want.  If you're picky and like your own iterations of things.. just go to Burger King instead.."}
{"text":"Great mixture of Grill, Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese.   It's really easier to ask them what's good at let them deal with it vs selecting off the menu.  the combination of tastes is so hard to predict.  They have Wagyu and Kobe.  I love it rare or blue

A little slow.. my only issue"}
{"text":"A coworker recommended this place & I had to try it. I had the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, which were interesting. It's not too salty, it had a sweetness to it which was different but not bad at all. It can get pretty packed fast, so keep that in mind. Service was friendly, I would def recommend it to people!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers with an Asian twist. Sometimes the place gets pretty crowded, but I think it is worth the wait.  So it is better not to be under any time constraint. The food however is awesome!  High quality products and great combination of flavors. So far I enjoyed everything I tried! And for sure I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Creative Asian twist on the burger.  Amazing flavors.  I've been here several times as I live close to the location on Windmill Ave.  Warning: this place is always packed full of people.  I suggest going right when it opens or at 3pm on a weekday."}
{"text":"Great burger place! Exvellent choices if a variety of burgers, salads, fries, n shakes. Onolicious!"}
{"text":"Bachi is short for Hibachi - Japanese type of grill. Bachi itself means karma.

Ordered:
- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11
- Kalbi Burger $11
- Miyagi-San's Burger $15

Tina's Treasures and Tribulations
- We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened and the place was pretty packed with people waiting and tables full - Only waited a good 6-7 minutes to be seated
- This place is definitely an Asian fusion of foods and burgers
- So of course my friend and I yelped this place before we ordered to see what was the MUST order items
- The oxtail chili cheese fries were good, but a con would be that it has to be eaten right away or the fries get super soggy. It was really good and I'm not even into beans as much as a normal person would love it. Garlic aioli sauce was on point!
- The Kalbi burger was taste and different with the kimchi and ko chu jang mayo that was in it. The angus beef was on point so freaking good. For the price, I would say it's worth it. 
- We went to Shake Shack the day before and I don't think they compare at all. This place definitely takes the lead for creativity
- The Miyagi-San's wagyu burger wasn't as great as the kalbi. I think the wagyu beef seemed a little undercooked, but we did ask for it to be medium rare - it fell apart as soon as we cut it in half. It wasn't melt in your mouth good. It was flavorful and juicy & the onion rings gave it a crunch that I loved. That egg though!
- Friend and I decided to order two burgers and share that. Obviously, we are like two little girls who cannot eat as much as a guy can so there were left overs. If you're hungry, I suggest get your own, but I think if you get fries and one burger - you can become full or content
- We ended up putting the bread/burger buns aside and ate the meat :)
- Will have to come back to try the other options!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. a different take on burgers if you are OK going out of your comfort-zone. the service was slow, but in there defense. It was a weird time to be eating and it was super slow. Everything was presented Hot and at the same time. it was a highlight of my trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I am not a huge burger fan-- but I love Bachi Burger! Prior to our Vegas trip, I made the suggestion to my boyfriend. And after extensive research (not really-- we just looked at Yelp photos), we opted for Bachi Burger over Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. We went right before they opened, so no wait! 

We were seated immediately and ordered some beers. My boyfriend ordered a Guinness on draft and I ordered a White Ale. The White Ale was very light and tasted similar to that of a Blue Moon. 

Now onto the food! We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries since it seemed like a popular choice-- and it was amazing! The oxtail chili, jalapeños, garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of a bed of French fries made for a delicious starter. My boyfriend ordered the famous shogun burger and I, the Miyagi grass fed burger. My boyfriend loved his savory burger which included unagi (eel) and foie gras. My burger was nice and juicy-- both burgers made with beef wagyu and cooked medium rare. Perfection!

In addition to the amazing food, we had a wonderful server. Great value for the food. Unfortunately, Bachi Burger is quite a drive off of the strip. Totally worth it but not feasible if your only mode of transportation is a taxi. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I waited a while to get served but, I was solo and put in the corner so I get it. I thought about putting a timer on my phone to see how long it would take to be greeted. Ok, I did do that. ( Once a server, always a server). The prices are a little high, but I think it was worth it. The music playing reminded me of my visit to the W hotel lounge in NY, but the lighting was like track lighting disaster. They should soften it up in there and put some plants around or something. I wanted to eat an amazing burger, thumble through Las Vegas Weekly drink a couple, make it one beer due to the cost and start my weekend early. I did love the Kiki Burger..perfect medium rare as I requested and yummy sweet caramelized onion jam with a mix of mushrooms and cheese. My $4.00 fries I could have done without. I wanted to take them out of the silly cone display. I ordered the salt and pepper fries which were decorated lightly with fried jalapeños, fresh cilantro, and grated ginger. They were shoestring thin and were luke warm upon delivery before my burger so were kind of cold after a few in. I like thicker fries though.The burger and the BUN was off the hook. If I hadn't spent $5 on a pint I would have spent another $5 on a special milkshake like the one with bacon in it. But, they ran out. Do look at the chalk board as they had a special milkshake of the day: white chocolate cranberry was the one when I came in Valentine's Day week."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING. WHY ARENT YOU LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA?!?

i simply do not have the money to travel back and forth from Cali to Vegas for every time i'm craving this. The first time i've had it was 5 days ago (and i've had a million cravings since.) 

KALBI BURGER -- you did me good.THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER FINISHED A BURGER AT A RESTAURANT. if you like korean BBQ, and you like KIMCHI cucumbers, this burger is definitely for you. the bun was soft and fluffy which was enough to compliment the korean sesame seasoned beef patty. the side of kimchi cucumbers boosted the flavorful burger. it added a zesty smell which wasn't spicy, but very stimulating with E-V-E-R-Y singleeeeee bite. 

JUST FRIES WITH PINEAPPLE KETCHUP-  Y U TASTE SO GOOD? yet so simple. definitely worth trying. but they charge 50 cents for extra. the pineapple definitely enhanced the distinctive aroma of regular plan ol' ketchup. 

k. i can't type anymore, the more i think about how good this place was, the sooner i'll die from separation anxiety and depression."}
{"text":"Grabbed take out one day and I got the Waygu burger....it was a very good burger! I Also got the truffle fires....they were pretty good. I wish I had time to sit and eat but if the take out was good I'm sure dining in would be better!"}
{"text":"Love the mix of ameri-asian fusion of burgers,  definitely recommend this place if you want to try something out of the norm. Excellent"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Bachi Burger.  I highly recommend giving them a try, even if you aren't a carnivore.  I don't like burgers but they make the best veggie burger I've ever had.  Make sure to get the pickles appetizer, it's really good.  And all of the edemame are fantastic! Oh, and go for the regular fries with the pineapple ketchup--so good!  

I downgraded one star because I've been here 6 times over the course of the past two years and never once has my order been 100% correct.  It's never anything major, but it's always enough of an annoyance that it needs a mention.  And I think it's kinda weird that they charge an extra $1 for additional ketchup for the already pricey fries."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had! A little more on the adventurous side I had the shogun burger, besides the amazing patty it has unagi and foie gras."}
{"text":"I was told that this place had good burgers and we must try them out one of these days. Unfortunately I feel that I had a bad first impression of this place. First, it probably took maybe 10 to 15 mins for us to even make an order. It was not busy at all so I expect for the server to serve us. This is our first time there so we wanted to ask the server some questions. She looked as though she was annoyed of the question. Plus, I asked for her to speak louder because I could not understand her soft spoken words. She repeated the same way she was speaking before. Basically she didn't care. Then as we ordered, she's basically suggesting we order this because it's higher quality. I'm like what? Did u throw an opinion on how we should order? I'm like no. I want to try this other thing. 

I believe we finally got our food after a half an hour. I'm Like oh gosh. How tough is it to make burgers??? Food was bland. I kept adding the sauces that were on the table to add some flavor. Throw in a whole bunch of chili powder so it could be spicy. I ordered the spicy miso burger. Didn't taste spicy at all. The burger tasted high quality and that's fine. 

But I don't think it's like amazing. 

I would rate this place a little higher if it weren't for the horrible service."}
{"text":"How can you not like made-to-order burgers with Asian flair?  My Kalbi burger -- Angus beef marinated in kalbi sauce with kimchi -- was delicious.  Hubby's Ronin burger -- Angus Beef, caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, and a fried egg -- was colourful and juicy.  We thoroughly enjoyed our selections, despite an unusually long wait for our fries (20 min?).  No explanation as to why the fries were missing.....

Check out Bachi for a fun fusion experience."}
{"text":"Expect what you've expected before from the other two locations (SE and Summerlin locations).

The menu is the same and so is the pricing. This used to be Healthy Bachi Life or something like that. Like everything healthy. I bet hipsters would've loved it. LOL.

So, service is the same, food taste is the same. Sometimes there are long waits but service is still exceptional like their food. 

Bottom line: closer another location, service and food did not disappoint. Would come back."}
{"text":"Interesting place, with an Asian take on a burger joint. The space is minimalistic.  Waitstaff was nice.  We started off with a perfectly prepared order of chicken wings.  The sauce tasted like a somewhat less sweet General Tso's.  The burgers were unique and very tasty.  I had the Banh Mi burger.  It was very good, with a complex flavor and a dipping sauce.  If I hadn't known that it was a burger, I wouldn't have recognized it as such.  My brother had the Miyagi-san burger.   This was more recognizably a burger, but a bit different too.  The parmesan fries were very good.  

Overall an interesting meal.  Don't go here if you're in the mood for a burger.  Go here for a change of pace from a burger."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has always had a place in my food palette heart. Love their Asian Fusion burgers. Their burgers are second to none in terms of the overall texture and flavor. Those buns. Damn. Those buns. Light and fluffy, then biting down into the meat and other ingredients just is heavenly. The rest of our food was good, but the burgers are what I come back here for. 

For our meal, we were taken care of by Paul. Accommodating and pleasant, he was able to answer our questions as well as making sure we were good for the duration of our meal. The food had a slight wait, but Paul made sure to keep checking up on us to reassure us the food was well on its way and into our bellies. Love this place, will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time - A burger place that is not located inside a glamorous casino and one that does not bear the name of a celebrity chef.  But an off-strip location that is a gem hidden from most tourists and also a local's favorite.

So we went to the original location on Windmill Lane and there was a long wait even on a late Sunday afternoon.  The hostess told us that they had a new location on Russell Road, about 10 minutes away, and there was no wait.  So off we went!

When we arrived there was indeed no wait - in fact the place was less than half full.  We were greeted by our server and was seated promptly.

The Kiki's burger was topped with a nice blend of sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, some exotic greens, bacon and cheese.  I opted for the \"no onion\" version, otherwise it would also have come with sweet caramelized onions.  A really yummy garlic chili aioli sauce was served on the side.

The sauce at first looked like some ordinary burger sauce.  But one taste and you'll discover that it's da bomb that complemented the burger perfectly.

The regular Bachi Burger was served with a generous portion of fresh lettuce and thick slices of tomatoes.  Again, we opted for no onions.

The beef patties for both burgers were cooked perfectly - charred on the outside and medium on the inside.  The quality of the beef was good.  The charred burger retained its juiciness, and it also gave the patty a slightly burnt \"crust\" which I really liked.

Overall, the burgers were great and I would love to try their other varieties soon.  A solid 4-star experience."}
{"text":"Fairly expensive yet quite tasty. I will say that the service was a 1 star while the food was great in flavor I cannot justify coming back anytime soon. I had to stand up 3 times to ask for refills, for my fries that almost never came and for utensils. Seems like basic stuff a restaurant staff should do."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from California and my friend suggested this place since it's across the street from where he lives. 
Serves was a little slow (Monday around 1pm) but the waiter was friendly and once we ordered the food came pretty quick. 
I ordered a BBQ Burger of some kind with the parmesan truffle fries. The prices are high but the food was amazing. I took a picture but never saved it otherwise I'd make your mouth water. We will definitely be back when we visit Vegas aging and I've told all my friends about it. So good."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi - it hurts me to write this review, but I do it out of love!

I love Bachi's food, burgers, and drinks, but they are seriously losing their edge. I had heard disappointed reviews from my friends and checked it out for myself.

There was a wait, but that is to be expected at Bachi. My date and I didn't mind eating at the bar like we normally do, but the host told us we couldn't. When we asked why, he said that different managers had different policies, so because we did it last time didn't mean we could do it this time, but maybe we could next time. Seriously? That's weird. We grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited.

When we were seated, I asked for a cider cocktail, as advertised on their chalk board, but they were out of their draft cider. Ok. Waiter suggested a different drink which I ordered. We waited...waited...waited...our food finally came - but my drink still had not come! My date ordered a beer when our food arrived and called attention to the fact that I still didn't have my drink. The waiter said it would be just a minute.

We were checked on by another employee and mentioned the missing drinks. She said it would be just a minute. 

I did finally get my drink, which was yummy, halfway through my burger.

-Long wait
-Inconsistent policies about where people can eat
-Keg out
-Bad service
-Getting a drink after getting my food
-No apology or acknowledgment

Bachi - I would have ordered another drink and dessert, but I didn't even get to finish my drink - what gives? Please return to your former 5 star glory!"}
{"text":"What??  I haven't written a review for Bachi yet either?

Their bread makes the burger. Of course, their meats are top notch, and the toppings are creative.  But the bread.  Oh, it's perfect!

The oxtail chili fries... Must get.  

And, their green ice tea has free refills.  And it's tasty.  Writing this makes me want to go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Kiki Burger is one of my favorite burgers of all. sweet and very tasty, with added caramelize bacon and mushrooms. when I want to eat something healthier I go for the Bachi fish, which is so delicious as well. Orgasm in my mouth every time I order it & one of my go to spots when I have friends from out of town visiting. 

My boyfriend and I believe their truffle fries to be one of the best we've had in Vegas so far. thin sliced, crispy and comes with a delicious sauce.

Boyfriends favorite is the Banh Mi Burger. I am not so much a fan, but he really enjoys this one due to the pickle carrots and dipping sauce that comes with it. I actually prefer the original Banh Mi hoagy because that's what I'm use to eating, not burger version.

However, Customer service has its ups and downs. One day their super nice and friendly, the next day they're the complete opposite. For example, one time they walked away from our table when we didn't finish ordering our food, and on another occasion they completely forgot about us for over an hour. One time we even had a waiter who carried a face expression as if he hated his life. 

Nonetheless, that never stops me from coming here cause their food is good."}
{"text":"I loved every minute of my first visit to Bachi Burger!  We started with an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (which came with chop sticks).  It was a delicious mountain of fries, an egg, chili and a lot of other goodness.  To drink, I had the Mandarin Orange Tangerine soda.  Delicious.  For my actual burger, I ordered the \"Kiki's Burger\".  Same as everything else- it was perfect.  We were so stuffed at this point, but decided to give dessert a shot.  The Portuguese donuts were not my favorite (a bit too sweet), but the trio of ice cream sandwiches was incredible.  I loved the sesame seed one.  
In the end, I was very happy with the atmosphere, customer service and food.  I cannot wait to go back soon and try out the pork belly steamed buns and more!"}
{"text":"I and friend shared
Oxtail Chili Burger (chill and chocolate)
Miyagi San Burger (wagyu and onion ring)
Bach Burger (Angus meat,pork, shrimp with Vietnamese garnish)  
Everything was tasty.
I will wright more latter."}
{"text":"Food is great, service was awful. Some of the food was cool when we finally got it. Each member of the dinner party was served at different times. They stopped serving many vegetarian options and made mistakes on the last person served ( 10 minutes after the previous person). Too bad, used to be one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Delicious burger that you can eat the meat alone.  But, the other stuff on it enhances the flavor of the meat.  I had the miyagi burger - love onion rings on it.  My mom had the banh- mi burger which she said was also delicious.  Our friends had regular burgers which they also said were excellent.  For appetizers we had oxtail chili fries - spicy and hearty.  Pineapple ketchup was a delicious surprise on a regular fries."}
{"text":"Bachi WAS my favorite restaurant but I'm sad to say it's off my list for good. I've been an avid diner since their opening. It's literally a block from my house and has very unique eats. The service has always been hit or miss, but I've always returned because the food proved to be on point. With that said, my last dining experience was terrible - service and food.
 
1. Our beer glasses were delivered hot and dirty.
2. Our fries were delivered cold.
3. Their burgers are served medium, so I always ask for medium well. My boyfriend asked for medium. Mine was served bloody and his was served well done. He ate his unhappily but I could not stomach mine and after we had to literally flagged down the waiter, I sent mine back. He brought back the same burger (which I had cut into) with the meat cooked to well. Again, not medium well. I found it to be odd that they would just reheat the patty, but oh well, I ate it. Mind you, this was delivered well after my boyfriend had finished his burger (I told him to go ahead because I did not want his to get as cold as our fries). 
4. Nothing was done to make this right. I posted on Facebook, tagged them, and sent a comment to their fan page ... and nothing. 

I realize dining experiences aren't always perfect; however, they should have comped my burger or offered a free dessert. This is why I turned to their fan page on Facebook and still nothing was done to rectify the situation. I'm saddened to say, we will not return to our once fav spot to eat."}
{"text":"Went here for take-out tonight. I almost drove past it and had to make a u-turn on Windmill so be sure you're on the lookout when going. As others have mentioned, parking is behind the restaurant. If you're in a wheelchair you'd have to enter by the subway and go around to the entrance facing Windmill. There's a waiting area with a leather couch and a table near the bathrooms so that was where I waited after placing my order. The server was very polite and quick to assist me, including a cup of hot green tea while I waited. The tea seemed like matcha or a powdered green tea and was pleasant. The food seems a bit expensive but it is indeed tasty-  would be more reasonable at 3/4ths the price. The mango milkshake was very tasty and made my boyfriend happy. I had the jasmine green tea boba and it was just alright. The boba were smaller than at volcano tea and some were a little too soft. An order of the peking duck dumplings has 3 decent sized little buns filled with several slices of duck, radish, herbs and garnish. They're really tasty, with the soft bun complimenting the savory meat. We ordered the Kiki and Banh mi  burgers as well. Both were tasty, with interesting combinations of textures and flavors to deviate from the standard lettuce, tomato and onion combos. Soy flavors had a strong presence in both, as well as a sweetness from either mirin or sugar. My kiki was a well executed medium rare. Unfortunately by the time I got home some of the fries had gotten soft. I personally like them on the softer side, so I didn't mind too much but something crispy lovers might want to consider before doing take-out.  I'd like to go again  to try the other things they have on the menu, perhaps focusing more on appetizers and sides. The japanese pickles and the sausages both sound promising. It's a little out of the way and a little overpriced for me to be a frequent customer, but it's a pleasant change of pace from the routine and an enjoyable restaurant. The interior isn't the most lavishly seated, but I really like the chalk board menu and use of warm-toned, richly glossed woods and marble throughout. The aioli for the fries is very tasty! An outdoor area would also be a nice addition as they have a covered area, but I don't know if their lease or the infernal Vegas heat would permit it. I'll go back in a month or two and update :} I'm curious to see how things evolve here as it has a lot of potential to be an awesome spot. Hopefully once business picks up they can lower their prices a little bit and expand their menu or interior."}
{"text":"So I recently went to this place to satisfy my cravings as it had been over 6 months ago, or even longer since my last fixin here. I can't remember bc it's been way too long. If you had asked me to rate this place a year ago, it would've been a solid 4.5 stars! Now, it has fallen down quite a bit as with their new renovations of adding an extended bar, (limiting their space to seat customers) and the huge lack of customer service...I for sure thought that didn't really matter to me as the food is the only reason why I even came. That got shot down quickly as my bahnmi burger was just not the same as before. It was too salty and the patty was way too dry. What happened to the yummy pickled veggies?? Maybe it was just an off night for the chef, but I will say I'm willing to try again. My lychee martini was tasty, but bartender left chunks of ice in it. Let's just hope this was an off night!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by a work colleague and it was so good! the burger, the fries - the service - and - it was quick. good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"The hostess stand is never manned well, service is hit or miss, I think the may be short staffed often (?)... It's never been bad enough to deter us from going. The burgers and flavor a are consistent and delicious! Love love love the salt and pepper fresh! The ginger, garlic and jalapeños combined with the crispy fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had the Miyagi and it was truly one of the best burgers I have ever had! The fries are nothing special. Steamed pork buns are delicious (kind of reminds me of the taste of Vietnamese pho). I have come back several times now and each time is consistently good."}
{"text":"First time at this location. They are understaffed it was a busy Friday evening we showed up at 630 and there were only 2 servers, a bus boy and 1 bartender. We were sat promptly. Compared to the windmill location that has an overabundance of workers this location needs HELP! Other than that our server was great, food was great !! Love that there's a happy hour !"}
{"text":"I have to stop here on my Vegas trips.
I seriously cannot turn down a burger from Bachi.
I'm never disappointed with what I order from here!

It's definitely a great place to get a fusion gourmet burger that tastes and looks so good.

The Kiki's is my favorite and their garlic fries with jalapeno slices are great for sharing!

The burgers start at around $9, but they're SO worth it if you're in town."}
{"text":"His place is epic!!! I like to think of myself as a burger connoisseur. This place has some of the most unique burger combinations I've seen in quite some time. Everything has an Asian undertones. The flavor pallet of the Ronin Burger is my favorite. Be sure to get he garlic truffle fries. They are to die for. 
The staff are all very accommodating and professional. Service with a smile. Very chill vibe. Dim lighting. Good for a casual dinner or lunch. Just be sure to bring your appetite. The portions are very generous. 
Ample parking and right next to the Regal theater for the dinner and a movie kinda of night out.
Btw, Katherine is on of the nicest and sweetest servers I have ever met. Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever you hear about \"high end\" burger joints you always have to wonder what and how they are going to be. Usually I think of In-n-Out or maybe Five Guys for a good burger, but now you can go and get a restaurant style burger for like $10-15. Bachi Burger is a joint like that where they throw the asian flair onto their burger in a fusion manner. I was a bit skeptical when I saw some of the items on the menu but when you try them out the flavor combinations turn out to be very good.

First we started with the oxtail chili fries - now for me oxtail is one of the best things ever, and when you combine it into a chili and then top it on top of fries with a sunny side up egg, you got a winner. It is definitely enough to share as an appetizer - we did for 4 people - and everyone got a taste of the flavor explosion.

Now there are way too many burgers to choose from, so our group of 4 decided to pick 4 different burgers so that we could all taste a little of each one.  We sampled the Ronin, Kalbi Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and the Crab burger. We got all of the burgers medium rare (which is much better than the recommended medium) as the quality of the meat was actually very good. Overall, every burger had its own unique flavor combination and each of them I would have been happy with getting, but I was glad to share and try each one of them out. The Ronin had a japanese flavor to it, the kalbi as its name implies, had kimchi in the burger and actually went very well with the meat. The spicy miso was also very good and as I am a fan of shishito peppers chose this burger - it definitely was not \"spicy\" as the name implies and could have used something to give it more of a kick. The special burger of the night was the crab burger that added a crabcake on top of the burger which in itself was quite delicious.

Overall, a very good \"high-end\" burger restaurant and I would like to go back and try some of their other flavors of burgers."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place on Friday after spending an evening at the Auto Mall and this appeared to be the only thing open that was on the way home besides fast food. I was excited to try it but mehhh - way overhyped and not worth the steep amounts they're charging for fusion burgers and fries.

Rachel and I had a kalbi burger ($11), oxtail fries ($11.50) and a side salad ($5). The food was decent and had very nice presentation but still this isn't a fancy restaurant and just because you make it look like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, I suddenly have to pay prices upwards of 20 bucks? I got the kalbi burger because it was one of the more affordable options and sounded good. It is basically a regular beef burger with Korean BBQ style sauce drizzled on the patty and some kimchi that didn't have much taste. Nothing special. If I had some Korean BBQ sauce, I too could make this exact burger at home. The oxtail fries were good but nothing more than some chopped beef and a sunny side egg on top of some cheese fries. It was good but not worth the $11.50 price point which cost more than my burger WTF.

Service was decent and we kept getting water refills without having to ask. There are certainly some characters working here and Rachel and I both had some good laughs at the staff's expense. Inside jokes so y'all needn't worry about it haha"}
{"text":"The host was friendly and sweet. The burgers had good flavor. The bottom of the top bun on both of our burgers were very toasted and hard.  The bun was so hard I had problems biting into it, but after 5 or so minutes the juices from the burger softened them up. My complaint was the lack of service. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time because it took awhile for the server to come over.  The server dropped off my water and had the host bring my boyfriend's tea. Then we didn't see him until 5 minutes after we got our food. We had to ask the host for refills. It was also upsetting to see a server sweeping the floors and cleaning, not wash their hands, and then grab plates to bring to our table and another table.  Also as we were done and looking for the server we got to hear someone that works there tell a different server to ask her table if they were going to get dessert and that everyone needed to cash out NOW.  No worries we hurried out as soon as we could find our server, and the burgers were not good enough to overcome the poor service so we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers. Wow. My taste buds are still thanking me. This place has some of the most creative and tasty burgers we have ever tried. It's like a sushi bar for hamburgers. Tons of fun and good atmosphere. Service was good. Kind of pricey but if you are looking for something memorable I would definitely go here."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Saw this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives a few years ago, and recognized the chef, Lauren Watada.  I actually met him in college when i used to live in Hawaii and i used to be a waiter at one of the places that he was a cook under one of Hawaii's most famous chefs.  So i've been wanting to try Bachi Burger for some time and i made it a point to go this time i was in vegas.

The burgers are masterfully crafted with quality ingredients, angus or wagyu beef, and definitely has the Asian flair of Hawaii Regional Cuisine.  Ingredients like furikake, spicy miso, Kalbi, and ox tails scream of Asian or modern Hawaiian food.  His time spent with Alan Wong and Roy Yamaguchi are very evident in the entire menu.

I had a difficult time deciding what to get, since i was only here for 1 meal.  My server was very helpful in pointing out what was most popular as well as what was his favorite.  I went with his suggestion (favorite) the Spicy Miso burger.  It seemed the most out of the box and unique so i went with it.  It was great!  Meat done to a perfect medium (as requested) still juicy but nothing raw.  Shishito peppers, roasted garlic, a spicy miso sauce, a fried egg, green onions, onions, a fresh artisan bun, OMG, so good!  All the flavors of a spicy miso ramen but in burger form!  I could have done with out the red onions though, the server said to try it with fried onions next time to add a crunchy texture to it.

I asked another server about fries, and if he preferred the parmesan truffle fries or the salt n pepper fries.  He said that he liked the truffle fries.. I had in mind the salt and pepper fries because it comes topped with sliced jalapeños so its inspired by salt and pepper chicken wings or pork chops that you get in Chinese restaurants (at least that's my take on it.)  But the other sever said that he liked the truffle fries, so i went with that recommendation.

The truffle fries were too strong a favor for me.  I know most people would probably prefer this stronger truffle taste but it was too earthy for me.  it also came with a tomato aioli which i wasn't too crazy about, not bad by any means but i think i'd prefer ranch or something.  Should have stuck to my guns on this one and gotten the salt and pepper fries.

I also wanted to try their short rib loco moco, braised short ribs on top of risotto topped with an egg, Ox tail fries, and the Miyagi San Burger, but that will have to wait till next time I'm in Vegas.

Service was very friendly, helpful, and easy to talk to, the place was not busy (off hours) the food did take a bit longer to come out of the kitchen but, i understand that everything is made to order and there are a lot of little things that go into making each burger what it is.  Definitely worth the wait!  I think Bachi burger could easily be featured in one of the major casinos on the strip and compete with other upscale burgers.

As for the name, Bachi it's short for Hibachi (Japanese for an open flame grill) or a warning of bad karma (a reminder to treat people with respect and kindness) quite clever."}
{"text":"I'm becoming a bit of a regular here, the service and the food are top notch! Try the Ronin or the Spicy Miso Burger."}
{"text":"The taste was really good but both myself and my significant other were sick for days afterwards from the burgers. The calamari is amazing though and has really tasty sauce, and the almond boba was really the best."}
{"text":"The burger and fries were outstanding! You can taste the difference in the Wagyu beef. The Fukusturu beer from Rogue brewery was clean and a perfect complement to the Black n Green and Banh Mi burgers. 
Service was great although a little rough around the edges in some respects. 

Why not 5 stars? I don't know, I reserve that for flawless evenings where everything is perfect and the ones I love are truly happy."}
{"text":"ive been here once(so far) on a double date. the moment i took i bite of my Ronin burger... *high pitched voice* shutup!  food tasted as good as its presentation. parmesan truffle fries. oxtail fries*deeper voice* shutup. shaking my head for such impressiveness. the four of us shared a bite of our burgers. the food gave me 'cited goosebumps('cited: short for excited). straight to my endorphines. i love that they're open late. i love what their menu offers. chill vibe.  the servers have deep customer connection. i admire the art hanging on the walls.  quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"Nothing stood out for me to go back. The burger was ok, I  felt it was a bit bland thou. We also got the oxtail chili cheese fries, which we ok as well; however, for the price point  that everything is set at, I wasn't impressed. Also felt the staff also rushed us a bit to order."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this new location.  The decor is nice and there seems to be more seating than the original location.  There is a nice size bar area with seating and you can also see the chefs in the kitchen preparing your food through a glass window.

There seemed to only be one server for the entire restaurant.  Although there were many tables seated, she was very patient and kept her cool.

We ordered the following:
*  Oxtail chili cheese fries ($11) :  A must try!  I order this every time I come here.
*  Bone Marrow Jam ($10):  Sooo good!  This plate came with one bone and 4 small pieces of toasted bread.  I honestly wish the portion was twice as much.  
*  Da North Shore Shrimp Truck ($11):  I think there were 5-6 shrimps.  It was good, but I wouldn't order it again for that price.  
*  Miyagi-san burger:  I've ordered this a few times before.  It's one of my favs!
*  Thai iced tea:  I've had thai tea many times before at many different places.  This was okay.  It was way too watered down to me.

My only negative:  The restroom was dirty and trash needed to be emptied.  


Overall, my experience at this location was great and I would return!"}
{"text":"This is the best food I have ever tasted... I look up this place on the food network channel from diners, drive-in's, & dives. And I cannot believe how good it was I ordered the spicy Meso burger and my husband ordered the Mr Ho burger along with the of tails chili cheese French fries...all I can say is everything from the staff to the food was more than exceptional .... Spectacular!!!!!!!! Is all I can say....I'm a forever customer........"}
{"text":"Yeah man!  This place is special in a town full of processed food (if you are trying to keep the bill low-ish)!  We are a burger family and this place exceeded our expectations!  If Austin, TX had one we would be there weekly!  Hopdoddy whaaaa?  The Ronin Burger?  Well...take yourself in and try that ish!  If you are within 200 miles its worth the drive!

The rocks margaritas fresh and tasty!  Can't remember the salty rim they use with hints of Hawaiian flavors (PM me if you have the answer).  Fabulousness!

Expect a slight wait but ya know...that's what we do in Austin.  Wait to eat!

Great show Bachi!!!"}
{"text":"This place is all the way in the back to the left. I came at about 4:30pm, only 2 other tables full at the time. Happy hour is from 3-6pm. 

I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries. They were good. The texture of the oxtail was like pulled pork. It wasn't the best chili I've ever had, but it was tasty. It overpowered the flavor of the oxtail, but was still good. There are some jalapeños jn there and a fried egg on top. French fries are skinny fries, and during happy hour fries are $5 off.

I also ordered the Miyagi-San wagyu burger which was $15 and includes the wagyu patty. It comes stacked pretty high at first because of the onion crisps which are really good. There is caramelized bacon which is good, along with chili mayo. The bun is also really good, it's soft, but not chewy. Overall the burger went together really well, the only regret was having it made medium. The server suggested it, but I think the flavor of this meat would have been much better if I had ordered it medium rare.


I also ordered dessert to go, the salted caramel shake with toasted marshmallows on top. I'm normally just a chocolate lover, but this shake was great."}
{"text":"So I dunno if you've ever been in a situation where you're really hungry and you're thinkin, 'Do I want a Burger, or do I feel like a hot bowl of Noodles?'  So typical..... I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa!
Well, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas.  Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!


Hachi Machi, give me a Bachi!!!
 
Bachi Burger is a Japanese Hybrid Burger joint serving the American classic  with Japanese twists.  It's become the culinary zeitgeist to throw a bunch of 'Asian' ingredients on anything and see what whacked flavor comes out (yack) yielding moderate to disastrous results.  Innovation is great but sometimes you just have to go simple.  

But when I feel like having something other than you standard Burger fare, I look to Bachi - the flavor combinations are nostalgic and the burger quality is pretty good.  Also, there's a proximity and it's open all the time (unlike the Foodtrucks that are sooo good, but just a scheduling/coordinating pain).  There's a previous review of Bachi - go ahead and read and you'll get what I'm talking about below...

Did you read it? Ok, good. Just as a summary, they serve a lot of Asian style dishes as appetizers, Chinese Bao's, Chicken Karage and Edamame, so you get a harmonic blend of Asian bites with All American Burgers. And for a guy like me who has trouble deciding on one cuisine, I get a bit of everything like an international buffet..but with good food.


Truffle Parmesan Fries:

Parmesan Reggiano + Black Truffle Porcini Cream + Sun Dried Tomato Aioli.  In my previous posts, I complained that I enjoyed what little gravy they provided for this cone heap of Fries that they stingily provide.
It seems that someone was listening; upon my recent visit, the Fries came with a generous portion of the creamy gravy that made those Fries uber luxurious and thoroughly fulfilling.  The Sun Dried Tomato Aioli does not work at all with the Truffle cream, however, since there is a portion of fries near the bottom of the cone that is not coated with decadent sauce, the Aoli serves a good condiment for those untouched by the earthy goddess...


Kiki Burger 

I've had the Ronin Burger which was pretty good, and the Black and Green Burger was amazing.  But my favorite is the Kiki Burger: an Angus Beef Patty with sautéed Shitake, Eryngii and Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and a Garlic Aioli.  When I first reviewed this Burger, my biggest complaint was that overabundant smattering of the Aioli drowning out the flavor of all the other ingredients, including the Burger.

Well, much to my pleasure, they had listened; the Plate was served with the Aioli on the side, which could be knifed on to one's liking.  This made a world of difference, you could taste all the awesome flavors that this burger has to offer: The charcoal permeated through the Beef, which alone was satisfying, the Gruyere + Caramelized Bacon elevated the unctuous bass level notes, while the Sweet Onion Marmalade was savory and sweet. I added my own level of Garlic Aioli, just enough kick to spice it up before each bite....Super delish!


So, now it come down to the Battle: who won?

For Appetizers:  I don't know, they both so different!!
For Main:          I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!!
For Dessert:      Bleah.....

There really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi.  If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya.  I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!

Always start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets.  It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines.  As for t"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Guy Fieri's Triple D, and promised the wife next time we go to Vegas we would stop by. First and foremost, it was good as advertised. We started off with the Ox tail chili cheese fries. Words can not begin to describe the deliciousness of this dish. I almost ended up eating the whole thing myself. This dish is a must have when going to Bachi Burger. I ordered the Myagi and the wife ordered the Spicy Miso with grilled onions. I ordered my burger med rare and the wife ordered her's med, but I ended up with a med burger and she ended up with med rare. I am not one to return food, so I ate it, and it was phenomenal! Didn't get to try my wife's burger but she raved about it, but only had one knock, and that was it wasn't spicy enough...But still awesome!! Next time I'm in Vegas we will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I wanted everything on the menu.  I only visit Vegas once a year and this was my first time there.  Will be back next year and will definitely get me something else."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their burgers and fries. One of my least favorite burger places in town. Disappointing menu options."}
{"text":"Woah! Lets start of with the fries, the garlic jalapeño fries were too good and the plain fries too! They came with pineapple ketchup, at first i was skeptical but the pineapple really compliments the tanginess of the tomato and really tones down the acidity of the ketchup, and did i mention it was delicious? The burgers were fantastic as well, i loved how they incorporated asian fusion into their food, however, i do wish they had more chicken or turkey options rather than \"the lonely bird\" it was good but just a bit to sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a low key family meal.Great service and wonderful with kids."}
{"text":"Where should I start?  We went to Bachi at around 11:30 and already there were people waiting.  However we got seated pretty fast.  We ordered the kimchi burger, Caesar salad, oxtail cheese fries, and peking duck sliders.  Let me say the oxtail cheese fries were probably the best fries I ever tasted.  I am not a huge fan of fries but with the added chili sauce and cheese, it was heavenly.  The portion was generous too.  Then the kimchi burger came afterwards.  Super juicy and tender.  The marinade in the patty made all the difference.  The sliders were okay and the Caesar salad was a unique blend topped with a slice of anchovy.  Overall will recommend to anyone who happens to be in Vegas."}
{"text":"The burger is ok. But I think it's a little over pricy. The Raman is very sweet and salty. Chasu is not good at all and they gave me too many eggs in Raman. The service is very very very slow. Took the waiter 20 mins to take our order."}
{"text":"OK so we're in Vegas for Thanksgiving & while watching TV on the Top Ten best Burgers in the US #7 is in Vegas. So I'm Like \"Let's go\" :D of course because its on TV it has to be good... Right??? OMG Bachi Burger became our #1 burger spot every time we're in Vegas..."}
{"text":"It first time going too Bachi Burger. It was family night with my brother and his family. My brother guys been too the other location so had good head up on food and menu. I was excited about checking it out! Plus brother had only positive things too say about it. 

The menu love because simple not reading novel and they stick too their strength and whole concept of the restaurant. It all about speciality burgers (still have basic burgers for the kids; two nieces got they enjoyed their burger). They have lot too choose from too. I had the Ronin burger, brother had the Miyagi burger, and sister-in-law not remember. Both my burger and brother burger had the fried egg. FRIED EGG and burger are peas in pod or heaven on earth. It done right on from the burger being perfectly cook medium (nice juicy), fried egg another perfection (the yolk ruining just right. fingers get messy), and my burger RONIN combine fried egg too japanese cole slaw, too kalbi sauce.The bun fresh, right size too the patty not over or under, and toasted just right. It reasonable price for high end type of burger. We got sides of sweet fries and skinny fries came with pineapple ketchup (the ketchup only thing not like about the meal; felt like it was way too sweet more like dipping fries in jelly then ketchup). The fries and burgers good eats.

We started with the oxtail chile cheese fries. Talk about prefect appetizers for four or five people. It great! The chili was so good could have order just chili with rice be happy in life. You add the cheese plus fried egg some jalapenos. Layers upon layers of tasty stuff. Get too the bottom still something on top of the fries!!

The atmosphere is great. It brand new location one that never knew about thankfully my brother finds these great local spots! The service our server was great she was very attentive, asked if ever been too Bachi burger, explained the menu throughly, great suggestion with appetizers, checking up on us constant basis, and management walking around asked us about our meal. 

If you ever have need for different burger not norm tBachi Burger is DA BOMB! Sure after having Ronin burger makes me want too check out the rest of the burgers on the menu. Sure be seeing me back."}
{"text":"The chili fries ... freaking awesome place. I am craving this place ... might have to sneak over here for dinner again. This place is hip, trendy great service but most important ... the dam food is good! Not had a bad meal here yet.
If your craving for something different  ... try this place out."}
{"text":"The food is usually great, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. Today I ordered a Kiki burger.  It was okay but seemed a little off. That didn't bother me. What bothers me is this is a great restraunt that seems to not understand that their service will stand out in the mind of the patrons more than the food.

It was 15 minutes from when I finished my food to when I was offered the check. After I had been served,  no one followed up, and my drink wasn't refilled. 

The food can be awesome,  but if the customer doesn't feel the service is descent they won't come back."}
{"text":"Had the Banh Mi Burger and Truffle Oil fries. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Oxtail Chilli Cheese Fries are outstanding."}
{"text":"Excited I finally got to try this place. It is a mix of Asian infused with american classics, burgers and fries! I have to admit I was a bit reluctant but was surprised every bite of the way. 

I started with a pomegranite ginger soda. Awesome and refreshing! It was killer hot out that day so it was a perfect drink. 

Then we moved on the the oxtail fries. Now I had read o. Yelp that they were a definite must. The pictures looked amazing so we couldn't go and not try it. Glad we did! 

I had the roast duck bao sandwhiches. Another dish I ordered from a picture lol. It was definitely different but one of those pleasant surprises. The duck mixed with the sauce they serve on the side was delicious!!!

Also tried the poke and bone marrow jam. Poke was good, nice chunky portions of fish. The bone marrow is a unique dish, not really seen in many restaurants so my curiosity got the best of me. It had a strong flavor, one that you might need to get used to. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this place already. I mean, why wouldn't I jump to write the review on this awsome burger joint right after my experience? Must have been the food coma from this yummy food.. or perhaps the beers that followed the food... oh well.

So I stopped by Bachi Burger with some friends (party of 5) sometime in the middle of August. I was worried about the previous reviews about the service. But we had no problems. Our server was awesome! It was about 9:30p and the place was half full. I wish I remembered the name of our server, he seemed so happy and passionate about his job! And gave us recommendations and whatnot.

So we started off with the truffle fries and I got the Kiki Burger, the BF got the Ronin, and our friends got a ronin, kiki, and a traditional burger. And the bf got some kind of lemonade thing, can't remember what it was, but it was good!

Fries came out pretty quick and they were gone in less than a minute! yummy stuff. The burgers did take quite a while. But the server did come by to check on us, so at least we weren't ignored. What sucked was that our burgers didn't all come out together. So some started grubbing before others cause we were starving and didn't want the food to go cold!

LOVED the kiki burger. Something about the sweet bun, it makes the burger. The flavors lived in happy harmony. Oh and the dipping sauce, interesting flavor. They gave me the wrong sauce by accident so I got to try 2 different sauces with my burger.

Haven't been back there since but I sure hope I get the chance again soon! LOVING Bachi Burger! Though this review may seem kinda not so helpful since I can't remember the details of my visit.. but I had to say something. I need to try their whole menu..! And I am sure I won't be dissappointed. Only thing is, it's kinda pricey for just the burger with no sides... oh well!"}
{"text":"So glad they have this location now. More items on the menu than the original location. Plus Sake Sangria. Yum. Got the oxtail chili fries. Filling and eat with a fork kinda thing, but awesome. Which barely made room for my burger, which my choice this time around was the myagi-san wagyu burger.

Dessert options kinda disappoints me, as I am a big dessert person. But I have yet to try their shakes. 

As their was nothing wrong with my visit, but this isn't a 5star joint. But a place worth returning to. Try their kiki to be safe, then you can get adventurous with the various options of deliciousnesses. Oh yeah, and truffle fries ;)"}
{"text":"Had the oxtail chili cheese fries, and spicy burger and it was so so delicious! Best fries and burger ever!! Will come back when I'm in town. :)"}
{"text":"Visited on 9/3/2014

Food: I ordered the Black and Green burger, medium rare. Cooked very nicely, and tasted fantastic. I also tried the beloved Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. They were ok; I honestly don't see what the big deal with them is. The only complaint I have for the food was the white \"Sanga-Ria\" I had on happy hour. It simply wasn't that good.

Service: Service was just ok. Our host enthusiastically sat us at our table. He seemed very excited to have us. This enthusiasm was not shared with our actual server. He did not seem very knowledgeable of the menu and almost seemed to be a bit hurried with us.

Decor: Establishment was clean and organized. This was expected, as the place had just began happy hour."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time last week and the SPECIALTY BURGERS were great! I tried the KIKI BURGER and it had sauteed shitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and topped off with garlic chili aioli! The burger was fabulous! And as I looked around at my friends, they had the same \"mmmmm\" feeling.  Funny enough -- of the six people there, 4 had the KIKI burger, 1 had the Kalbi Burger (w/ Kim Chee), and another was adventurous and made her own burger with Wagyu Beef, fried egg and bacon!  Unless I am mistaken, most burgers are made with Angus beef or  Wagyu ... and there is a bit of sweet flavor to it! 

Watch out Carl's Jr because if this is in your town, I will definitely pay up for Bachi's Specialty burgers at $8.50  than your Angus burger at $6!

If you're going to have a burger, you have to order fries with that, right? Right! So, add the sweet potato and/or truffle parmesean fries to your order!

So if you can find your way here, definitely go - hope you enjoy your meal as much as I did!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it didn't live up to the hype for me. Sorry this was a miss. The food seemed over priced and missing flavor. The spot was very busy but the staff seemed rushed and not focused."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant with two of our friends. They have given this restaurant such very big rave that they say it should be a must try when you visit Las Vegas. My husband had the Spicy Miso ramen and I had the Kiki burger. We had the takoyaki octopus cake. The takoyaki is okay. There is one small octopus in it so I guess that is a plus point for them but I tasted better than that. I have to admit that the Kiki burger is good. It is good but not that extraordinarily spectacular."}
{"text":"We always go here for their burgers, loved it, but went in for breakfast today, which we were very excited for! Got Egg short rib Benedict, very good, a must try! And we also got wild mushroom hash, if you like brussels and a lighter taste, then you will like it.

Bachi is our favorite burger place, and never disappointed at their food, would recommend everybody to try it!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that the stars are strictly for the amazing food.  I've ordered every possible burger and appetizer on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The service is really hit or miss though. By the look of the staff there's consistently new faces so there's an obvious turnover problem.  At times we thought we'd get around that by just ordering takeout but that's only if they decide to pick up the phone.  Don't get me wrong though we've had some very positive dining experiences too. Unfortunately we've had one too many dining disappointments that we'll only go here at very off peak times or if we're really craving that Miyagi burger and oxtail chili fries."}
{"text":"I had the Shogun burger. It's one of the priciest on the menu, but it's definitely worth the splurge! Treat yo self. The oxtail chili fries were awesome! If you're looking for some unique burgers with an Asian twist, this is the place."}
{"text":"This was amazingggggggggggg!!! I can't even remember what type of hamburger I had but I remember that it was amazing and I would go there alot of there was one near me. They have some weird combos that make you look sideways but once you have them you won't think twice about going back. They had us in and out very quickly with great service."}
{"text":"Well, I have had a lot of hamburgers in my day. This place serves one of the best I've ever had. Perhaps the best. The menu is creative and inspired. The thing holding this location back is the staff. We were seated promptly among the other FOUR guests in the restaurant. Six total customers. There were about a dozen staff members there, at least 10 on the clock. At least 5 minutes after we were seated someone finally came to our table and brought us water. Then a few minutes later the server arrived. Slow. Very SLOW! After the server finally made contact with us, things got better. She was a nice gal and paid good attention to us. The Parmesan fries were nice, but whatever sauce the put on them made those fries it touched, cold. Hmmm. The burgers were OUT OF THIS WORLD! 5 star burgers, 2 star staff so I'm gonna say 4 overall. That's probably generous, but I will go to Bachi again, maybe on the east side next time. The food is worth going back. We'll just expect poor service going in and not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through triple D and since I was in the area, I thought I'd give it a try! Wow, am I glad I came here! The food was absolutely amazing and the worker staff was super friendly from the moment you walk in. 

The pork belly buns are a must if you get the chance to visit! They blew my mind and everyone else's who had the chance to try one! If you're looking for a savory burger, try the spicy miso burger, but if you're looking for something unique, try the Banh mi burger."}
{"text":"SO happy we stumbled upon this gem! The amazing infusion of excellently asian flavors into these exquisite burgers make this place our favorite burger place we have ever been to, and we travel A LOT!
As you can see by my photos, they were incredibly appetizing, the sweetness of the brioche and other magnificent ingredients made the Blue & Green burger spectacular! The husband and I are both not fans of bleu cheese, so we subbed it out for the deliciously amazing gruyere cheese. The one bummer is the expensively lavish pricing when it does not even come with any fries or sides of any kind...
They have a M-F happy hour from 3p-6p I believe, and it says they have milkshakes (& adult milkshakes too) on their, but it's listed as the exact same price as they are regularly on their menu.. odd..
He go the unlimited iced Matcha green tea, which was very diluted, and around $4, my pomegranate & Ginger soda was only 1 fill for about $4.5 & very strong and delish. I took.it in a to-go cup, added water & ice and finished it all the way thru Whole Foods after.
As you can see in the pictures, we also ordered the Kale salad, which was about $9 for my meal I believe, and since these burgers do not come with any sides at all included (that price you see next to the burger is legit JUST the price of that individual burger), we ordered sweet potato fries on the side additionally, for around $4 or $5 for that small portion that you can see in the pictures I uploaded. It came with some sort of Wasabi aioli ( it tasted like Wasabi, but was not sure of exactly what it was), and when I asked for ketchup I was brought a little dish of very odd tasting ketchup, not sure what it was, but somewhere else on the menu I remember glancing over they are option for pineapple Ketchup, so it could have been that, but it's hard to put a finger on exactly what that funky taste was. 
There were some tasty looking items, and fun milkshake creations, including adult milkshakes, but we were so full that we will have to come back again and try that next time.
Our bill for just those items was close to $60.. a bit pricier than we expected for that meal, despite it being very tasty.

They had so many delicious options, we seriously cannot wait to go back for more... Maybe if we win some moola on the strip."}
{"text":"I have to warn you that this review doesn't talk about their main staple because we don't eat meat.  We wanted to go to Miko's Sushi but didn't know they didn't serve lunch.  We had to think what restaurant is close enough and had some meatless options.  Since we have been hearing good things about Bachi Burger, we decided to see what the hype is about.  I have to say that they're vegetarian options are slim pickings for sure.  I ordered the Bachi Fish Burger, my partner got the That's Cheesy, and we shared the Garlic Salt and Pepper Fries.  I liked the Fish Burger but my partner wasn't a fan of the Grilled Cheese sandwich.  He didn't like the combo of the cheeses in it.   We traded because I saw his face and he wasn't liking the dish.  I liked it enough.  I thought the fish was overcooked and that made it somewhat dry.  They were pretty stingy with the tartar sauce.  The fries we're pretty good.  I just wish they were a bit more crispy, or at least let the oil come off a little longer.  
The biggest thing that was disappointing was the service.  With a very generous staff, I was surprised how slow the service was.  Granted, they were full to capacity with people waiting to be seated, the service left a lot to be desired.  Took them about 10 minutes after I have my card ready for payment to be picked up.  Good thing we weren't in a hurry.
I have to say again, this isn't a reflection of their staple, the burgers.  They might be a good place for burgers but I have to say that the service needs to be more attentive.  If you like burgers, I'm sure you would like it more.  Also, they need to update their menu on the wall because they don't have some of their items available.  Also, they need to have spell check.  Instead of Chocolate Hazelnut Ice Cream Sandwich, they had \"Cocolate Hazlenut.\"  I just think they should have more vegetarian options.  Then again, it is a burger joint."}
{"text":"In my opinion the food was phenomenal, the service was great, and I probably had the best burger in my life here."}
{"text":"I'm not easily impressed but the restaurant served us fantastic meals! The burgers were juicy and tender, yet have their colors expressed perfectly. The combinations were unique, and a bit \"adventurous\" but they worked out great! Would definitely come back here and try different burgers. 

The only issue is too much veggie between the buns. Those veggies made cutting a challenging process.

Overall, I think my money was well spent.
Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I was largely disappointed with Bachi Burger. We went for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was not crowded, and we were the only customers waiting, but it took a very long time to get seated. The service to the table was also quite slow. The food was good, but drowned in extra sauces and overpriced for the portions."}
{"text":"Love Bachi Burger!

Every time I come to Vegas I have to stop at least once. 

It pretty much doesn't matter which burger you get, they all taste amazing. 
Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly bao's, and the OXTAIL CHILLI CHEESE FRIES! Do not get regular fries when you have all these options."}
{"text":"First, food tasted great!! We started off with Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Bone Marrow Jam. Ordered fries coz I love oxtail and was curious. It was good but way more than we can finish. It's not a knock, just a warning that this is more of a large group app or for a meal unto itself. The marrow was absolutely divine! It was cooked to perfection served on the bone and you eat with little triangle toasts. I wanted more! 

For my main course I had Kiki's Burger which featured specialty mushrooms. This is where I had to knock off a star. They ran out of the featured ingredient (mushrooms)! Really?! We came in at their opening time on a Saturday. How is that possible? I still went ahead with the order inspite of this and have to admit the burger tasted great. And that aioli - yum!! 

Hubby had Banh-mi Burger. That was good too, tho a bit overdone for a medium. 

The wait staff was wonderfully attentive. Our waitress was friendly and expertly answered all our questions. She gave suggestions right off the bat. I like that. So yes, will definitely return when we're back in town."}
{"text":"I took a friend to Bachi Burger, I've only been there one other time and I just had the oxtail fries (which is highly recommended). This time I ordered their truffle fries and their Kiki's burger. Their burgers are hand crafted just for you! Let's just say it was the best burger I've ever had! Also, Nick, our food server was The BEST! Very friendly! This is the spot! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Hawaii & moved to LA, visit Vegas occasionally and this place makes me feel like I'm back at home. From the minute you step in to this place, there's a good vibe. The music is very local and the people are very welcoming. We came during lunch & looked like there were many tables available but the wait was 15 minutes.
I didn't realize this place was also a ramen joint so my boyfriend ordered a burger & I got the spicy miso ramen. We also ordered the oxtail fries. The wait wasn't too bad either. They let you know that the burgers & ramen come out of separate kitchens so it will come out in variations. 
My ramen was tasty & had a flavorful tamago in it! The burger & the fries were huge! We could not finish even half of it but all the food was great. Service was superb, Our waters were constantly refilled.
Next time I'm in town, I will definitely get a burger for myself!"}
{"text":"Bachi burger and the ramen joint next door was disappointing.  We ordered a variety of appetizers which included fried calamari, sweet potato fries, octopus fried balls which were all mediocre.  Nothing wow.  Then comes the entrees which included the tiki burger which tasted somewhat like the western bacon cheese burger from Carl's jr.  The garlic ramen was flavorful, but again nothing to get excited about.  Also took home an ordered to go, the banh mi burger, a Vietnamese inspired baguette that that now turned into a burger was nothing to really praise about after having the first bite.  For desert, we went with the donut and ice cream, again very average.  

In terms of service, our server was nice; however, the attention to details was not there.   We were not given proper utensils such as knifes for our burgers and spoons for our ice cream.  Also our appetizers that was brought out were placed on our napkins."}
{"text":"Came here on a weds night.  We ordered two bowl of ramen.  I had the garlic ramen and it was way too salty.  I don't think I'll be returning here for ramen again.  As for the service, very good and attentive."}
{"text":"Ok I admit their burgers are very good. But is it really really worth waiting 45 mins for a table for a $11.00 burger not including fries or drinks? oh I forgot the tips too. I think I'll stick to In-and-Out."}
{"text":"Ronin burger, you get 5 stars on your own. Sooooo good. It's an explosion of flavor in your pie hole! Wow!!!! 

5 stars for selection, fast and friendly service, value, location, and TASTE!

MUST HAVE: oxtail chili cheese fries and Ronin burger. 

I will definitely come back to try their other food items."}
{"text":"Food definitely gets 5 stars!!! Going to a restaurant begins with the experience of the ambiance, service, and food quality. You walk in the front door and there's a tiny hostess stand with a \"waiting\" area of about 4ft by 8ft. They're very busy so after putting our name down & qoated an hour we were told to wait on the patio, or if we wanted a drink to go to the counter/bar, which was 2 ft from the hostess stand. It was a claustrophobics nightmare. The layout needs to be adjusted badly. Having one guy serve drinks to everyone, & I mean EVERYONE, servers, guests waiting, takeout orders, is crazy!! We waited 20 min in this long line stretching around peoples tables, which was awkward for them and us. Who wants to be surrounded by extrememly hungry guests while you're trying to eat at your table?! Then when we finally got up to the top, one of the servers told the hostess to start telling people to go to their other location. She turns to us and says, \"If you want to go to our other location, we can be seated faster.\" HAHA, that's in Summerlin, and we've already waited 30 minutes. That's the most rediculous thing i've heard. We sat on the patio which was 100 degrees outside and wasn't even like an actual patio, more like my un-occupied neighbors backyard patio with metal chairs and uneven tables. The restaurant wasn't much better then outside. For a well known restaurant, you'd think they could afford better a/c. They had floor fans in corners of the restaurant, which just blew hot air since it was soo hot in there already. I have never gone through such agony to try a burger in my life. Only getting take-out from now on. When we finally got a table, thank goodness we already had bought drinks because it took forever to get one from our server, granted they were busy yes, but when we're dieing of heat stroke, I wan't WATER!!! The staff you could tell were all over the place. No organization, or leadership it seemed. I grew up in this industry and just as fast as you go up, you can go down, and it's hard to go back up from there. The water had no ice in it, the food took forever, we're overheating from having to wait outside in the middle of summer, because inside waiting area was built for toddlers. But, the food was great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to give it a try.. the atmosphere was pretty cool. It's a small place but looks like they keep it fast pace. I was surprised they sell ramen too. I had one of their burgers and their meat was fresh and cooked to the way I liked it. I tried their fries and they were good too. I love thin fries. Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because $15 for just only a burger is pretty expensive."}
{"text":"The coffee mint spiked shake is delicious. Had some of the usual favorites, oxtail chili fries and onion rings. Also tried the Bachi house salad for the first time and the vinaigrette dressing is so good and light."}
{"text":"I love asian fusion anything so when I found out about this place I had to go! Restaurant is very clean and service is great! I ordered:

Banh Mi Burger- This is a burger replicating a vietnamese sandwich. It came with fish sauce on the side. The burger had slices of pork, shrimp, pate and a pork patty along with a side of pickled radish, carrots and cilantro. Overall, taste was very unique but not something I would eat again. I much prefer the real Banh Mi over this burger.

Kiki's Burger- This had bacon, mushrooms and caramelized onions with a garlic chili aioli. This burger was amazing. Everything complemented each other and the beef was definitely moist and juicy.

Truffle Parmesan Fries- very good and it was nice and crispy. 

Just Fries with Pineapple Ketchup- this was also very tasty and the ketchup was a great touch to it."}
{"text":"It would be 3.5 stars.  Very, very good burger (not as good as mine at home, but good)...but stupidly priced.  I am not frugal or cheap, I piss away money on food and beer/wine all the time have no problem doing it.  But as good as these burgers are (and they are good) stupid price.  Alright beer selection, but it could be better..."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop by to buy some groceries during our vegas trip and Bachi was right across the street so we just had to stop by. We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which was okay. However, the chili was pretty amazing. Meaty with a bit of spice. MMMM Everyone ordered an item off the burger list but since I'm not a huge burger fan, I opted for a specialty sandwich which I feel that they don't advertise much of. I ordered the Lonely Bird which was large enough that I was able to save a bit for dinner. I was also able to try a bite of the ronin burger which I would recommend if you love eggs and fried things lol."}
{"text":"Really. Good. Burgers.

Best burger I've ever had in Vegas... the burgers are very flavorful but not greasy. Quality ground beef, fried egg, and other random ingredients make for a really, really good burger."}
{"text":"Burgers refined & redefined! 

Amazing selection of gourmet burgers, which makes it hard to decide, but no matter the choice is sure to please. Our group of 4 (3 adults and 1 child) ordered the Bahn Mi, Miyagi-san, Spicy Miso and a children's cheeseburger. All three gourmet burgers were standouts and the children's burger was a hit too.

The Bahn Mi was our favorite. The depth and range of flavors are indescribably delectable deliciousness.

Only critique, the Parmesan truffle fries are quite unappetizing to look at. Taste is, okay. The appearance of runny brown sauce on top was unexpected. If it were described as a gravy sauce on the menu it would have been less of a shock. Not what we imagined Parmesan cheese fries to look like. A positive, the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is 100% tasty. Scrape off the brown slime and dip away.

The servers are on their mark. Great knowledge of the products, good descriptions and attentive. Waiter forgot my iced coffee, but was easily forgiven since after the very satisfying meal it was time for a bit of eat and sleep.

Aloha!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a burger place with an asian fusion theme. I've been here once and the Summerlin location once. Ive tried 2 of their burgers: Miyagi-san Burger and the Banh Mi Burger. The Miyagi-san Burger was pretty good..wagyu beef, chili mayo, caramelized bacon, fried onion rings, fried egg, and furikake seasoning if i remember correctly. The crispy onion rings, gooey egg, and saltiness of the bacon matched really well. When I finished the burger, I thought I had like a \"loco moco\" version of a burger with onion rings (minus the gravy). The Banh Mi burger knocked it out of the park..shrimp and pork patty with nuoc mam (i think thats how its spelled?) sauce and pickled veges. This was probably the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. It got better with every bite. As I was eating it, I was intrigued that i was eating a burger but the flavors REALLY DID remind me of the banh mi sandwich (which makes u think of the french bread cut lengthwise and eating it hot dog style). The resto is also know for their oxtail fries which i will try on my next visit. 

The resto has a nice, cozy feel with some tvs. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The only thing I would have to say negative is the boba drinks are a little too pricey.

Overall, Bachi Burger is the best burger place I've been to since moving to Vegas."}
{"text":"The Ho, Miyagi-san, and pork buns...all amazing! We loved the asian twist. 3 picky people, all loved it!"}
{"text":"My only update from before is that the Kiki has toppled the Ronin as my favorite burger!"}
{"text":"Hubby heard about this place on Diners Drive-ins and Dives so we thought we'd give it a try. We were seated within 5 minutes and just beat the crowd. Our server gave us some suggestions since this was our first time. We were tempted to order ramen but figured we could get that at home so we opted to get burgers.

We liked the salt n pepper fries and calamari, not so much the takoyaki balls. All of our burgers were delicious! We had the Ronin, Black and Green, Miyagi-san, and Spicy Miso. Mine was too much for me after eating the appetizers and fries, so I took half back to the hotel and had it for a snack later that night.

Service was really good, too. If we're back in area, we'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went here last week. This place has been on our food bucket list for a while now. We had the oxtail fries, miso burger and the pork bun appetizers. 
I was disappointed in the fries. The sauce had a weird sweet taste. It would have been good had they omitted whatever they put to make it sweet. I split the burger with the hubby, and while it was good it wasn't anything special. 
The pork buns were yummy, but this seems like one of those \"trend\" foods that everyone is trying to do. You really can't go wrong with these and they were good. 
Service was good, I would probably go back and order other things to try."}
{"text":"Haven't had enough to give this place a true review. My burger was good, but cooked a little more that I would like (and asked) caramelized onions was a bit bitter and salty. But overall the service was on point, and the flavor of the burger was good, plus there are plenty of burgers I will come back for. Thanks Brian P. for the recommendation....and for lunch!"}
{"text":"this place is pretty decent. will need to come back for a clear review.

came here with my boyfriend before we headed out clubbing. we both ordered the spicy miso burger and a side of truffle parmesan fries to share. very tasty, juicy, and definitely very flavorful. i love the fact that you can ask for it rare, medium rare, and etc. only problem my boyfriend and i had with the burger is the fact that we actually didn't get filled from it. maybe we just have super blackholes instead of actual tummies, but it kinda put us off a bit.

fries were interesting. we didn't really like the truffle sauce on top. but i guess that's just our taste in food. (should've gotten the garlic fries! darnit!) it came with a side of spicy sriracha-mayo sauce, i believe. the sauce was delicious!

overall, i think i'd have to come back again to give it a decent review.

there is A LOT of parking, so don't be afraid. service is 5/5 as well."}
{"text":"Waiting for a table is not uncommon, but it's definitely worth it. There was an old couple who had gotten out of there car and were walking to the restaurant. I ended up jumping over a bush and racing towards the front door just so that I could beat them. I haven't ran that fast since I chased an ice cream van and that was at least 2 months ago. 

The miyagi san burger is to die for. Literally speaking you would probly die over time if you ate it everyday considering the mouth water sauce, soft bread, onion rings, bacon, and an egg cooked to perfection. As if that isn't enough, be sure to stuff the truffle fries down your throat as well. This place is must!"}
{"text":"Food is really different which I liked. Burger meat is good quality. Some of the add ons or burgers just over kill. I have the blu burger and they just over kill it with too much blu cheese. I love blu cheese but there is a line. I have had another burger that I added garlic to it. If a vampire was within 200 feet of me he would have died after one bite. Once you scrape off the excess it's pretty bomb. The actual restaurant the tables are pretty uncomfortable. They are all just flat wood. No cushion or anything. At first it's like ok I can dig it because it's different but once you have been sitting a few mins you are like this isn't comfortable at all. Add some cushions or something. Jeesh. For amount you are paying it should be 100% on point."}
{"text":"A new instant favorite! The Miyagi-san burger and pork belly buns were excellent first impressions..will hafta return to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The burgers here definitely are good. I've tried the Kiki and the Ronin. Both hit the spot.  

I recommend the Oxtail chili fries. They are very good. The service was pretty good when I had gone. I went with a group 10+. Waitress was friendly and was usually there when needed. Also when the check came we asked her to split certain things on certain checks and she had no problem with it.

 Good service and good food. The only thing is that its a litte pricy for a burger drink and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The burgers are juicy, crispy, and full of flavor. The brioche bun is warm, fluffy, but holds up to the burger. I went because they were on diners, drive ins, and dives and they lived up to the hype. The variations on fries are amazing and generous helpings. They even have a decent sized beer list with great prices."}
{"text":"OMG i freaking love this place and I am so glad that it is in VEGAS. 

If you havent seen this place on the Food Network channel with Guy Fieri Diners, Drive Ins & Dives then you are missing out.

It is located off the strip so its not too busy, but when it does the wait is a little long and their waiting area is not equipped with a lot of chairs.

I love their pork belly sliders, the best ever. Its not on a regular bun its on a steamed bun omg the pork belly just melts on your toungue its soo good. Also try the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. Heaven literally an orgasm in your mouth and they top it off with a over easy egg. HEAVEN! 

I ordered the Kalbi Burger Medium. OMG! Best burger they have and if you like Kimchee you're in LUCK! I usually add a overmedium egg on the burger and it tops it off. Babe usually gets something different or gets the Kalbi but this time she chose to get the Spicy Miso Burger which was really good. I think all their burgers are all good. They have really good flavors and what they pair them with its just perfect lol.

Their service sometimes suck when they're busy, takes them a while to come back to you. But the food really makes up for it."}
{"text":"Ok, so I love a good burger...so the fact that his place has an EXCELLENT burger? Wow. Drooling. Every special burger is mouth watering. They don't skimp on toppings and the quality of the meat? Winning.

I added a sunny side up egg and avocado to my burger and it was amazing...I am currently drooling and itching to go back at this very moment. All you need is the burger, although I do want to try to the pork belly!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers and fries! Went here twice and this is what I've tried:
Truffle parmesan fries: ordered it both times :) the fries are your good standard size fries and was the perfect crispness but the aioli dipping sauce is what makes it! I keep the sauce and spread it on my burger too :p it'll make any burger amazing 

Burgers I tried:
Kiki burger
Blue and green burger
Kimchi burger (forgot the menu name but it had kimchi on it)

I would come again for the Kiki burger but the other two were solid as well. ( my fiancé got the blue burger, and then the kimchi the other time). He enjoyed them both but I'm just not a big fan of kimchi in my burger nor blue cheese but they are solid. The best thing about this place is there meat to bun ratio... Sooo much meat... =)

I also had the iced jasmine tea with boba. I was lightly sweet with a hint of boba. I like jasmine tea so jasmine tea + boba = good stuff.  I have can sensitive sweet tooth from time to time so I actually had to add a little bit of water to make it less sweet, but it was still good!"}
{"text":"I am only giving BB 2 stars bc the food is AWESOME! like 4+ stars awesome! The service at this location, especially is HORRIBLE. Everyone I know says they never have any service issues at the Windmill location, and I usually go to the Sahara one, but this one is the closest to me. I admit I keep going back to the Sahara location in hopes that one day they will improve their service, because their food is so darn good. But no. Every time the staff seems to not care at all about the customers. They will leave you standing at the door for 5+ minutes when they see you there. I am in the service industry myself, so I know all it takes is a smile and, \"Ill be right with you\" to make a guest know they are seen and acknowledged. EVEN just eye contact is enough most of the time. Tonite I was greeted by the ???, a male. He got me water and told me my server would be right with me. I then proceeded to sit there while the server did other things, totally ignoring me. Never once saying a word to me or even giving me eye contact. They were busy getting drinks for one of the two tables in the restaurant. In total there was 7 people there. Even one server should be able to give decent service to 7 people. I ended up leaving without getting anything but a initial greeting and water from the first person. And no one even noticed me leave. This was my second attempt at this location. I give places and people the benefit of the doubt, but Im done here. With this city being saturated with good restaurants all over the place, there are other places to give my money to. Sorry BB, your (lack of) management and your servers ruins your amazing food."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday at lunch - no problem finding parking or getting a table for two. Waitresses were really nice, but kind of absent when you actually needed them around. 

I got the Ronin Burger - angus beef, caramelized onions, cold slaw, miso dressing, yuzu aioli and a fried egg. It was messy, but it was really a melt in your mouth burger. The bun is really soft, slightly sticky like a baked porked bun. 

Truffle Parmesan fries - nothing special about these - you're better off trying a different side, especially for the price they charge for these truffle fries.

Oh my goodness, that burger was amazing. You have to come back and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"What do I do when I first land in Vegas? I start looking at my Yelp bookmarks!

My cousin and I wanted to start things off with a great meal. To the days leading to our Vegas trip, he kept talking about Bachi Burger until my ears had a constant ringing! I finally gave into his pleas and agreed to go. After picking up our rental car we headed to Bachi Burger.

When we arrived, around lunch time, it was semi-busy. The hostess quoted us a seating time of ten minutes. It seemed the wait was shorter than that. We ended up getting a table within five minutes. Once we were seat, our menus were handed to us and was told our server will be right with us. Our waitress came to us within a couple minutes and took our drink orders. After being dry from the airport, I decided to get an alcoholic beverage. I went for the Sake Sanga-Ria.

The Sake Sanga-Ria was a light and refreshing drink. The combination of sake and sangria had an inviting taste, but then knocks you with a light buzz. Who am I to complain about that! The bits of apple in the drink were also laced with the concoction of alcoholic goodness.

For our appetizers we ordered the following, which include these ingredients:
  
- Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black, Vinaigrette,  Hoisin, BBQ Sauce

- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries With Garlic Aioli and Fried Egg

The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. The steamed bun was soft to bite. The veggies, boiled egg, and sauces made the steamed bun very enjoyable. Next, the oxtail chili cheese fries. I have never tasted anything like this! I'm only fond of the chili and cheese on fries, but the oxtail takes this appetizer to another level! The oxtail was tender, fries crispy, and the chili thick. Adding the fried egg on top of this dish my sound weird, but it just made it much better.

For my main course, I ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger. This burger was composed of chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. When I received my burger, it was piled high with the listed ingredients. I had to split the burger in two to handle this burger. Biting into the burger brought memories of another favorite burger spot of mine in San Jose, CA. Konjoe Burger. The summation of this burger was juicy, tender, and crispy.


The nagging of my cousin about this place was well worth it! This was just our first stop, but I felt like we overdid ourselves. Oh boy!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum=spicy angus burger, iced coffee, salt and pepper fries, truffle garlic fries and chili cheese oxtail fries (we like fries) 
Service=good, everyone was really nice, waitress was very intuitive
Presentation=great

We will be back to try more burgers!"}
{"text":"I saw an episode of Diner Drives and Dives and waited for the moment until I would visit Vegas! Today was that day ....and the food was amazing! I paid an uber driver money just to take me there...and then told them both to make sure they come back and visit themselves."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST! BURGERS are absolutely delicious! 

Kalbi burger- never knew Kimchi would taste so good inside a burger! ordered this with a fried egg. the patty was thick and the sauce was amazing!

I will definitely come back to try other things from their menu!"}
{"text":"Just came back from Las Vegas. Made a stop at Baci Burger and had the Kiki burger. Amazing. After my 2nd visit to Baci Burger, I announce that Baci Burger has the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love Bachi Burger. My wife and I have been there two or three times.

The Bachi pickles are awesome! It comes with approximately 8 different types of pickles (radishes, garlic, etc.), all of which are deliciously different.

The edamame with garlic, ginger and chili are positively addictive. This was the first place I'd ever had edamame stir-fried with seasonings. I thought it was a great idea and have been experimenting with different flavor combinations at home.

We've tried the garlic salt and pepper fries and the truffle Parmesan fries. Both were delish!

The Peking duck steamed buns are very good and have a nice, sweet sauce.

We've tried the Kiki's, Bahn-Mi, and Kalbi burgers. All were perfect fusion burgers. Very unique but made perfect sense when you ate them.

The only bad thing is Bachi Burger is on the other side of town from me. Love the place!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are so flavourful, juicy, and delicious! We had the miyagi burger? I think? Anyways, the buns were cooked to perfection and the toppings worked very well to enhance the burgers' taste!! The regular fries were thin and crispy, just how I personally like them. We also tried their shoyu ramen which was also amazing. The broth was perfect (not too salty, not bland), and the noodles and egg(s) were cooked nicely as well."}
{"text":"*see photo of nasty discolored foie gras*

Keith tried to pass this off as normal (pukes) first Keith explained it as the eel causing the discoloration when the eel is BELOW the foie gras once telling him that he said it was foie gras oxidation which is a fancy word for old. A lot of excuses but no answers! I've had a lot of foie gras and never has it had a mineral taste and hopefully it doesn't make me sick because they assured me its 100% safe to eat. This burger is $26 because of the foie gras and it is moldy discolored and nasty. They did nothing to rectify the situation. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Let's begin with look at my damn pictures! This place is on point with presentation. I feel its casual up scale dining. But getting back to the beginning..

Walking in this place is large and gorgeous. Lots of space, modern decor and a type of kitchen view in which you can almost watch the cooks prepare your food. I am impressed with this because then I feel as if they are not hiding anything. I decided to sit at the bar.

My server was Naomi who serving me at the bar. They had sports on and also another criminal investigative show which was really interesting. There was another server Carla who would drop by to ask how my meal was and if I needed anything. It was nice to have such prompt servers who cared how my meal was and if I was content. Naomi recommended their homemade pomegranate soda. Very refreshing, not too sweet.

Let's start with my favorite dish to compare to the many I've had from other restaurants.. Calamari. Light fry coating. Perfect. I can't stand when the calamari is greasy, it's seafood and supposed to be light. Calamari wasn't fishy, and it was paired perfectly with mint, tomato julienne, lemon to garnish and their tangy sauce. You had to really get all three in one bite to capture the flavor. 

Ultimately I decided to go with something outside of my comfort zone. Be different. Be unique. My choice? Brussel sprouts. YUCK! But your not going to believe it.... these brussel sprouts were to dye for. BEST BRUSSEL SPROUTS EVER. did I really just say that? YES. They had this delicious sweet sauce, bacon and pears. What a combination. my mind was blown, sweet and salty. Please go try those. I will come back just to get my brussel sprout fix. 

Next I choose the mushroom fries.. I cant remember their exact name but it was just as delicious as the sprouts. I'm not a mushroom fan but the waitress recommended them, so why not. I asked for ti on the side as a safety precaution. It was very rich mushroom but not the type of mushroom flavor I was expecting. I found myself constantly dipping them. I saw on the menu they had a homemade pineapple ketchup so I asked for a side of that as well. Sssh, don't rat me out but I ended up taking that home because it was the best ketchup ever. I'm going to have to find a way to recreate it.

Lastly I went with another third item out of my comfort zone... fish sandwich. Side note, I'm not a fan of lots of onions so when it came to my bar spot I almost dyed. I kept thinking of my breath and the fact I wouldn't be able to kiss my boyfriend for days. Carla reassured me that the onions had a mild taste because they soak them. Well, they hadn't done me wrong yet so in I dived in the fish. Whoa! She was right, the onions were mild, yet crunchy.. gave it an amazing texture. The fish had a sweet but tangy sauce on it and really pulled it together. I've had fish at other restaurants in which once you bite into it, the fish falls to pieces. Not this one. This fish was a champ and determined to not disappoint. 

Lastly, the portions are ginormous, I couldn't finish everything. I almost felt like letting the waitresses know I felt they were too big. Like, I the customer was ripping off the restaurant for the size of food I was receiving. Great prices for what you get. I walked out like a bloated whale and almost had to unzip my pants. I probably would have but my shirt was too short so I had to suck it up. Next time I shall order less and get dessert. The bread pudding Naomi said was to dye for."}
{"text":"The hostess was extremely rude and told us that if we didn't want to wait, we can just leave. We were quotes a wait time of 45 mins but waited for 1.5 hr. Very rude service!!!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I ever crave or want to go get a burger (blasphemous to some of you I know) 

However, whenever in Vegas this is definitely a MUST stop place on the way home. My go to burger is the Miyagi San which is a grass fed \"Wagyu\" burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake ,Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings. DELISH! Always cooked just right with just the right amount of everything. Get that burger alongside some regular or sweet potati fries and a shake... BAM! in food heaven.

Definitely worth the hype"}
{"text":"Diana is the best server around! Coming from Hawaii we wanted to try the famous Bachi Burger! We were not disappointed. This place lived up to all the hype! On top of the amazing food, was our amazing waitress Diana! She was friendly, accommodating, and she made our first meal at Batchi Burger one to remember! Thank you so much Diana. She should definitely get a raise, she's the bomb! 

I would recommend the Kiki Burger, Bachi Fish Burger, Spicy Miso Burger and the Ronin Burger and the Miyagi San Burger. Out of the 5 burgers we had we all rated our burgers a 5/5! We would recommend you opening a location in Hawaii! We are so amazed by the quality of the burgers here! Thank you Bachi, keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"Burger was okay but not worth $16 and took too long to come out. Fries were overpowered with truffle oil. Ramen broth was extremely salty. Service was very bad. A few times I looked for a waiter he or she looked away."}
{"text":"So, this is Bachi Burger's newer location and one of the first things I like about it is the elbow room.  It seems a lot spacious and less crammed versus the original location plus there's options of things I could do before or after going here. There's bars, a theater, and restaurants just walking distance. Yea and it's located next to the movie theater.

The must have are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. It's not amazing but just something they are known for, just get and get it out of your system. It's a pile of your usual French fries, kind of wished they were thicker maybe use tater tots or steak fries, topped with a oxtail chili cheese mixture, cilantro, jalapeño, and a fried egg. Order it with your burger and divide it among a group of friends.

I almost alway get the same burger, the Spicy Miso Burger. Don't let the name fool you it isn't even spicy. It's an angus beef patty with shishito pepper, swiss cheese, onion, mayo, lettuce, some sauces, and a fried egg in a bun. Not bad, tasty but the only way I'm satisfied with it is adding lots of sriracha or other other hot sauces on it.

I like what they're doing with their menu, creative and would impress many. The service here has almost always been good except when you want to divide checks, I think the max was up to 4 split checks no matter how large the party but they'll let you charge as many cards if you want on one check so it usually works out."}
{"text":"Ok it's about time I update my 2 star rating I gave them years ago. Being that I've been here and to the other locations a bunch of times.

Bachi Burger oh yeah I'm a fan of their burgers, not all of them, but enjoy most of them. Their kalbi burger is right now my #1 favorite at Bachi Burger. It's a little messy to eat, the sauce can go running down your arms while eating it if you're not paying attention but I can never turn it down. Kalbi in a burger how awesome tasting does that sound. Well it's more like a burger with kalbi sauce and kim chi but if it was kalbi short ribs it would be really awesome. Hope someone makes that somewhere soon. Always the kalbi is delicious. Sometimes I'll eat it so fast, cause it's messy, that I'm done before everyone else and I'm like do I order another one.

As always they have their oxtail chilli cheese fries which are excellent to share in a group. Their various burgers, spicy miso not spicy but tasty you should ask for some hot sauce. Not a fan of their truffle fries. You can also order their ramens, was gonna try it but again can never turn down an opportunity to eat the kalbi burger. 

Customers service at most times are good but sometimes when they're too busy it seems like their overwhelmed, you no the usual. 

I'll definitely be back. I'll try not to order the kalbi or spicy miso burger cause I need to try something else but no guarantees."}
{"text":"Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and my second experience is better than the first. I had the oxtail chili fries which I love. This time I had the Kiki burger recommended by most reviewers and YUM! The night ended with a salted caramel shake which was so good! Customer service is  also. 
   The only thing I don't like is the lighting in there. The bright little lights are a little oppressive. Maybe it's just on at night??"}
{"text":"Food tasted great. The servers are super friendly. The prices aren't too bad either. This one had a ramen house merged with it so we were able to order off their menus too. The Ramen broth was a little on the sweet side for me but it was still tastey and I finished my bowl. The bachi burger was delicious I would recommend that. The oxtail fries had beans with it too but not too much that it was overwhelming  I would've liked it with no beans at all though."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this location and I loved it just as much as I did the first time. There was no wait for a table at around 1:30pm on a Monday and service was fast and attentive. We ordered some nice cold brews that they have on tap as the waiter made menu recommendations to us. We decided on the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer which was very good however it did have more chili then I would've liked  but that didn't stop me from eating half the plate. We ordered the Miyagi-San burger which is their most popular burger which was 5/5. The spicy miso burger which had a good kick to it and also 5/5. The Kalbi burger which comes with a side of kimchi also 5/5. Burgers were perfectly cooked and the buns had a nice toasty crunch to it. 
Prices range from $9 for a basic burger and extra for add ons to $15 for their gourmet burgers. A bit pricey for a burger joint but their gourmet burgers are very filling and portions are huge and can be shared. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm a non-meat eater, but still liked it.  Grilled cod sandwich was very good. Sweet potato fries were excellent.  Service is friendly.

The place is not easy to see from the street.  It's in the corner of a strip mall next to the movie theater.  

I would come here again for sure.

Aw, hell no! I just got my bill and they charged me for a tiny bit of bbq/hoisin sauce.  It's only $.50, but I hate that.  Where's my credit for the other sauce that I didn't use?!

Seriously, I hope the owner reads these reviews.  So much though went into the menu and plating.  It's a shame to ruin an impression over silly pricing policies."}
{"text":"Pricey but good specially the Ronin Burger and the steamed bun with pork belly...I didn't care much for the Kalbi Burger...

Not the type of burger that I would care to have on a regular basis but a good conversational subject..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service not so good. I had the Kalbi  burger & the wife had a Bachi burger. Both were excellent, but a little under cooked for what we asked for. The kim chee on my burger was just right, not over powering. We went on a Monday evening. There were 8 tables occupied & 3 servers. I had a beer & we both drank water. The water was filled once & the napkins we asked for when the food came never arrived. That was the extent of our servers attention. Beer & water were dropped off as she took our food order, she dropped off the burgers. That was it. The manager brought the appetizer & we had to ask him for the check after we finished eating, after waiting 20 minutes. Don't recall who filled the water, but wasn't our server. I do recommend this place as the food was great. I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kiki burger and was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. The patty was medium well and juicy with plenty of seasoning, the mushrooms and cheese made this an even better burger.

Ordered the Salt & Pepper French fries which could have done without the Jalapeño Peppers, but the dipping sauce made up for the peppers.

Also had the Garlic Wings which were tasty, but could have done without all those sesame seeds!

Overall, a good experience and would highly recommend way off the Strip."}
{"text":"Deliciousness. Thoroughly enjoyed the place. Great food; great service. This is a spot to take your friends for sure"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times Guy Frieri has let me down.  Almost every Triple D location I've been to has been less than ordinary.  However, Bachi surprised me with their delicious flavors and Asian influenced burgers!  They use high quality ingredients, but everything is entirely affordable...especially n Vegas! I went twice on the same trip.

---The Food-----
I tried the Ronin Burger (medium rare---$10) which had 30 day aged Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing!!! (dipping sauce regularly found in Shabu shabu), fried egg, katsu bbq, and a citrus aioli.)  The meat which is super tender, thanks to their \"bachi\" style of grilling and the combination of flavors are sensational.

Another item you MUST get is their ox tail chili cheese fries ($12) which is in a different class all by itself.  Supreme layering of tastes that is indescribable.  I'm a lover of chili cheese fries too, and don't hand out these recommendations willy nilly.  I would not mind ordering this as my meal one of these days.

Their oxtail chili cheese Bachi dog is delicious as well! But the size could be better for ($10)

My burger quest to find the best has stopped at Standing Room in Redondo Beach, but this place comes a close second...which is why it gets 4 stars.

Bachi has three different locations in Vegas and the next time I go to Sin City, I'll be sinful and order more of their burgers! I encourage you to do the same! 

Extra Notes
Takes Credit Card
Long Wait...expect a 20-25 minute wait every time
Beautiful oriental decor
Great Service
Clean restaurant and restrooms
Many TVs 
Small parking lot
Bachi, in Japanese has two meanings:
           1) its short for Hibachi which is a Japanese style of grilling. 
           2) Its a word which means to treat others the way you want to be treated."}
{"text":"Honestly the service alone (in both locations) is enough to make me hate this place. They are ALWAYS slow- slow to seat, slow to greet, and slow to serve. Good luck getting refills or sending back a plate (which you will need to do either for cook or special order- they ALWAYS make mistakes with orders) or even getting everything you ordered because they don't check on you after you get your food. We ate at the Windmill location recently after Christmas 2017 and they weren't even busy and we still experienced terrible service. It's not necessarily all the server's fault- they only had two people on the floor.

Although the food is okay, I'm done with Bachi Burger in both locations because of service."}
{"text":"Ordered a Miyagi without mayo due to allergy and medium well. Burger arrived with mayo, so I sent it back. Waiter brought it back almost immediately, so I asked if they just wiped off the mayo in the back and he honestly responded \"yes.\" Sent the burger back 2nd time and requested manager. A different waiter visited our table as my order came out a 3rd time and I asked if it was company policy to just wipe off burgers made incorrectly (obviously his response was \"no\"). Ridiculous and lazy! 

Will not be returning any time soon, seeing as there are plenty of other burger places and service generally sucks at this location, anyway. Service at this location is slow and every time I order, my meal arrives with some error requiring me to send it back (last time it was cooked incorrectly and took several tries to get to right cook- the cook this time was past well done and had no furikake for some reason, but mayo was more important issue).

When service is better, or if I move closer to the windmill location, I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place after work one day and I'm happy I tried it. We split a few things and one of them was the burger with blue cheese. It was so good. The meat was so moist and the cheese itself was the perfect touch. We also had fries with a very good and unique ketchup that came with pineapple in it. Made it extra sweet. The other fries came with truffle oil and were so good too. My friend ordered a burger with bbq sauce, bacon and onion rings that I tasted too and everything was really good. One thing I didn't like was the sangria. It was very bitter and I asked them to put some 7up in it to sweeten it up and it was a lot better after that. I would come back here for sure when I crave a burger."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry for this one. From beginning to end I just wasn't impressed. Walking in we was greeted by an older gentleman who asked us to wait (politely) while he cleaned the table we would be sitting at. While we were waiting another younger gentleman came over to assist with seating and was pretty much asked to go away by the older gentleman. We were seated and told someone would be right with us and about 15 minutes later we were finally greeted at our table. We placed our order and the fries were brought out about 10 minutes before our burgers. So of course being hungry we eat the fries first until the burgers come and then eat our burgers as well. When we were almost done my lady placed her plate aside so she could look something up on her phone and she was asked if she was done with her food with a hand pointing at the plate in question literally about an inch or 2 away from the food. That alone was just gross to me because you can ask without touching anything. Overall the food was ok but I can admit that there were many distractions so I could have just not been focused on enjoying my meal. There was a lot of food delivery services in and out and a bit of frustration with the lack of good customer service. I probably won't be back but I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"This is probably a 4 star join, but my tastebuds won't let me do it.

I went to cautiously Bachi with a friend, who adores this place. She ordered for us: Oxtail chili cheese fries as our appetizer and Spicy Miso burgers.

I had never had oxtails in my life, and after finding out what it was several year back I didn't want to. My friend convinced me to try the oxtail fries, and surprisingly they were really good. I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating cow tails. Yes, I am a wimp.

After snacking on the fries, I had high expectations for my burger. The burger wasn't bad, it just wasn't special. You can definitely tell that quality ingredients go into the burger, but the flavor was kind blah. Nothing sets it apart for any other quality burger. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I only ate half.. that never happens!

It's a bit pricey for a burger, but I think walking in you kind of expect it. The service is awesome.. everyone kind of helps you out. I don't think I will return due to my personal preference, but I do recommend checking it out at least once."}
{"text":"I think it's between 3 or 3.5.

I try really hard to be a burger person but I give up. Burgers are just burgers. I'm happy with my In-N-Out. 

We ordered 2 of their popular dishes to share among the 3 of us.

1. Pork Belly Steam Buns
2. Ox Tail Fries 

The pork belly was good! The sauce they gave us was not hoison sauce so it was just okay. Too thick in my opinion.  The buns were moist and not that wet where it would break apart easily. 

I'm not sure what's the big deal with the fries. It's something different I guess since it's ox tail chili? They use thin fries for this dish which was crispy and I like.

I shared the spicy miso burger with my friend. I'm glad I did cause I was okay after the appetizer. Miso burger is also one of their two popular burgers there. The spice wasn't too bad and the meat was juicy. But nothing special."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong things? I wish I could return for a do over but as I live in another state I'll just have to lay out my experience for what it was. A-OK. When in Vegas on vacation I scoured Yelp to find a truly \"local\" eatery that we could visit for lunch with our friends. All the Vegas yelpers and some Honolulu yelpers I know were all wowed by Bachi Burger so I insisted we drive off the strip to eat there.

First off the decor is not the greatest, just a dimly lit space with tables and chairs. I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it's clean and the food is great. We were seated quickly and our waiter gave us the run down on popular dishes. I ended up ordering the kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries and a peanut butter chocolate shake. Our food took awhile to come out but as we were catching up with our friends we didn't really care. 

My Kalbi burger had less flavor than I expected. I think I had it in my head that it was going to be sweeter but the size of the burger was good. With all the ingredients in and on the burger I think I expected it to be a small miracle of flavor bursting into my mouth. Talk about high expectations huh? The sweet potato fries were overcooked and too stringy so I only ate three of them and didn't finish the rest. My peanut butter chocolate shake was $4 and much too sweet. I'm a sweets fiend so if a place offers a peanut butter chocolate shake I am guaranteed going to order it. I think there was too much syrup added to my shake so there wasn't a good balance in the flavors. Sad panda.

Our waiter was a really nice guy but one thing which was very odd was that in the middle of our meal he asked us a question from behind the countertop that adjoined our table. It just felt a bit rude, almost like your neighbor listening in on a private conversation and chiming in from behind a fence. I don't think he understood why that was rude, but it's something that could be fixed for future diners. Overall very good service and smiley service.

I'm sure many will disagree with me about Bachi Burger, but I really, really wanted to like it! After reading all the stellar reviews I think that I just didn't order the right items for my particular palate. Maybe on my next trip to Vegas we will meet again Bachi Burger and we'll have a redo. I always believe in second chances. Yelpers obviously love you so there's got to be something that I missed during my visit!

{"text":"Holy hell. Was there was a hidden camera show happening to see how long we would stay? We ordered ramen, sweet potato fries, and a black and green wagyu burger. Had to ask a few times for water refills, ramen came out first and alone, then the fries 10 minutes later and then the burger 20 min after that which had to be sent back because the medium rare was still mooing, 10 minutes later still no burger. Fries and Ramen where good, service, kitchen, and management would get negative stars if it existed. Sucks, good creative food ruined by everything else."}
{"text":"When I want some burgers during my Vegas trip, I make sure to come here. My best friend recommended this place to me and I was so glad he did! Prices can vary depending on what you order, but I've always averaged at $20+ for a burger/fries/drink so it's not really on the cheap side.

I've tried about 4 different types of burgers here and they just don't disappoint! Meat is super juicy, their sauces are amazing and bread is delicious as well. I just don't care what people say after eating their garlic fries, it's very good! *5 star for the food.

Service is very good, just not good enough to give 5 stars though. It took some time for the waitress to help us out, but from there she made our experience pleasant. *4 stars for the service.

For a relatively small restaurant, this place seats a decent amount of people and is very clean. Downside is that it can be a challenge to move around due to the lack of walking space. *4 stars for the atmosphere.

Thinking about their burgers is really making hungry again. Can't wait until my next trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely get the oxtail fries and the truffle fries! I had the Bahn mi burger which was unique and well-received. Nice flavor and interesting combinations of ingredients. My fiancé had the Ronin burger and I don't think he was super into it but he said he would have tried something else next time. I would come back to try a different burger and would get a lot of fries!!"}
{"text":"I write too many 5 star reviews but what fault can be found with Bachi Burger? It's perfect. Miyagi-San, Lonely Bird, 'Just Fries' with delicious pineapple ketchup, adult milkshakes, go hungry, leave stuffed and euphoric."}

{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I aways try to squeeze this place in and finally got the chance this time.   I have to say I'm underwhelmed.  So they bring out the big steak knives and I got all excited.   These things are going to be epic and large.  The size... Ehhh, smaller than I thought.  What a waste of the steak knives.  I ordered the Mr. Ho which comes with the taro buns.  I'm not sure who Mr. Ho is, but someone needs to let him know he needs to put more taro in his buns or else it just falls flat, and seriously, who wants flat buns?  I was expecting some soft buns too especially with the taro in there, major let down. I took two bites of the bun and just decided to eat the patty by itself.  The patty is flavorful but I'm not sure what sauce they have on that thing but it just ruins it.  The Chinese sausage was cut too small and were hard and just fatty.  There was no crunch in that burger at all.   We also ordered the Kiki.  It's so not memorable that I can't even comment on it.  Too much hype and a big let down.  Service was average, parking plentiful."}
{"text":"The food just melts in your mouth. Great dinner.  They could help the waitress out with some assistance."}
{"text":"This place really made our trip, we didn't have many great experiences with food this time around in Vegas but this place? OMG, BEST BURGER EVER!!! I got the \"Miyagi-Sans Burger\" I added cheese cause i love cheese and omg it was amazing! My bf got the \"Kiki's Burger\" which was good as well but the miyagi was way better the flavor was just out of this world, we got truffle fries which were also amazing and Bacon Takana fried rice, everything was exceptional! I would say that staff was not very attentive and we found ourselves trying to get their attention but wont stop us from going back!"}
{"text":"Do you want something different? Feel indecisive between Asian & a flavor packed burger? This is a dream come true. I love a solid cheeseburger and for me this is The burger spot of all burgs. I've been more than a dozen times and they've never let me down. 

They have a variety of choices when it comes to fries. 

Salt & Pepper Fries, Garlic Truffle Fries, Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (with egg) 

My favorite Burger is the Myagi San Burger which comes with an egg , bacon onion ring and cheddar cheese. 
I ordered mine medium rare and it always comes out just right. Always packed with flavor !

Another favorite is the Spicy Miso burger. 

They have salads, vegetarian sandwich options and A fish sandwich as well. 

They have some craft beers there too , none really caught my eye so I went with a Stella."}
{"text":"I got there at 430 to meet daughters for one of their birthdays. Sat down and waited for rest of party to show. By 510, not one single person came to our table to see what we wanted to drink, order or say kiss my ass. I believe one of the managers was off duty (one of the friends was joking and said can I speak to your manager and the manager stood in front of him, joking around) and had friends there, the waiter and the one pregnant waitress were all  shooting the breeze with each other and didnt even notice we were there. Needless to say, after the 40 minutes of waiting we left. Would have loved to try the food, but the service or employees just werent around, i guess they didnt care that a easliy over $100 order and tip didnt matter to them as long as they got to talk to their friends.

{"text":"I'm an avid viewer of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and I've always wanted to go to the places that Guy goes to but most of the time they are on the other side of the states. When I saw that he went to a burger joint in Vegas that was Asian fusion? I quickly bookmarked it and was already anticipating my next Vegas trip. I've been here twice since and I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite burger joints.

Not located anywhere near The Strip, but relatively close by in the neighboring city of Henderson The restaurant is tucked away in a plaza but easy to find and plenty of parking. Make sure you call in advance to see how long the wait is! I usually call and the wait time for me around dinner time is around 15 mins or so for a party of 8. The wait area is small with a few chairs. The restaurant is cute, simple, and modern. The service is quick and fast and the workers are friendly.

Since I've been here twice, I've gotten the opportunity to try many different things, especially since I shared with one of my friends!

--Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Holy Oxtail! My favorite appetizer here for sure. When you pop the yolk on the fried egg and let it drip down onto the fries, it's literally food porn. The fries are nicely fried, the oxtail is sweet yet tender, and the chili is delicious. A very savory yet sweet appetizer and I love! 5/5

--Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Took a couple bites of this and I like it! Probably my second favorite appetizer. The pork belly was fatty and savory and together with the steamed bun, boiled egg, and the hoisin sauce made it extra yummy. 4/5

--Hot Crab n' Creamy Cauliflower Dip: Ordered this on a whim with my friend to share and I did not like it at all. It sounded good with the artichoke and cauliflower, but the flavors were so odd. The crab was extra fishy and the lap chong did not compliment the fishiness at all. It was horrible but it wasn't delicious either. I stayed away from this. 2/5

--Kikis Burger: This was the first burger I tried and the variety of mushrooms in this burger is what sold me. The burger was so juicy and delicious. The garlic chili aioli was a nice finishing touch to the burger as well. If you're having a hard time choosing a burger, I'd say this is a simple yet delicious burger to try. 4/5

--Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger: I had this burger this past weekend and anything with a fried egg is already a plus in my book. After one bite, my eyes literally rolled back. It was so darn good! The fried onions, the bacon, the egg... and best of all you can really taste the quality in this burger. It was juicy and flavorful. 5/5

To many, many more trips back to Bachi Burger whenever in Vegas. Although, I heard that they may be opening one in LA?"}
{"text":"I'm not a big burger fan. Don't get me wrong this place is really good! But there are other places with better burgers and fries. Let me start off with what I didn't like. The fried chicken and calamari. I've only been here twice but every time I have had it. It is not crispy at all. Calamari is very small and just not good. I'm a huge fan of it so I try it everywhere. Other than those things. This place is good if you want a twist on the original burger. Little pricey if you ask me. Fries don't even come with the meal. Service is good and I would come back. Good but not great!"}
{"text":"I was TOTALLY  disappointed with the service. I came here to Vegas from Ewa,Oahu to visit my kids and grandkids for dinner. It was my 1st time here. I was looking foward to my 1st \"Miyagi San\" burger but it was very late coming to me. My kids and grandkids were ALL done eating b4 my order came. I turned it down cause waiting that long for my dinner wasn't right....so when I get back to Hawaii  I'll spread the word about this incident!!!! Much Mahalo's!!!!!"}
{"text":"I' just finished my burger and fries and it was just as good as the first 10x iv been here.  The fries are thin cut, think Mc Donalds fries. The waygu burger is so freaking good the meat and the bun are excellent. This to me is hands down the best burger in town. I eat burgers and pizza every week so I'm considered a professional. I have also tried the ramen and that is really good too. I tried a ramen that wasnt spicy and i didnt care for it. Theres a lot of noodles and not a lot of vegtables. I had a spicy miso something and it was delicious. I usually go with the burger but if u like ramen try it out. I really like this place but maybe I'm being extra nice because I'm buzzed off a hoppy ipa on draft I got. Good times."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the Moco Loco and fries for lunch (plenty for us). It was delicious.  The burgers being served at the other tables looked amazing. We just flew into Vegas and wanted to get lunch before checking into our hotel. This was perfect - easy to get to before hitting the strip. Service was awesome - very friendly and also made sure our drinks we were \"ok\" without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Hello Jemvvie! Oh I hope I spelled that right (sorry if  I didn't). I wish you and your team were working in LA; I would eat here every night! 

The recommendations you and your trainer (I think his name is Dan but I could be wrong) were amazing.  You both were incredibly sweet and you never made me worry about having allergies. Both of you and the hostess even came to check on us. I don't need to be constantly checked on to be satisfied with service, but you all were so friendly. 

With a service background, I can recognize great service. You both have got it. Thank you so much for a great experience. People in the other Bachi Burgers can learn something from the crew here."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a group of friends here a few weeks ago. The wait time was a bit long but it was worth it! I had the ronin burger and of course i added some bacon to it. Definitely a great choice. Their sodas are pretty tasty as well. I recommend either the white peach one or the cherry yuzo soda. Both delicious.

Overall id come back for sure. Great food and great service, just be prepared to wait a little"}
{"text":"Great burgers.  The quality of meat is amazing.  No sauce needed. Fries are extra but the burger is usually all I can handle.  They are pretty big."}
{"text":"The hamburger was the only thing had a good flavor, but I think very expensive for it. They gave a receipt of $45 at the beginning then when I was going to sign it was different price of $65 they didn't say anything for it no even a sorry or anything they just charged me $ 65. Frankly I don't think I will come back. Service was 3/5. They charge for extra for salsa or sauces."}
{"text":"I got the oxtail chili fries which gave you a really good portion, however i found it to be rather heavy on the salt. another person at my table also commented at how salty his burger was as well.
i think this is an okay place, but if i were going to las vegas to grub, i wouldn't come back here again just because there are more unique/better places to check out! but if ya really wanna try another korean fusion restaurant, then i guess you've come to the right place even though i really do not believe in korean fusion ANYTHING. 

This place does a meh job of it."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while and decided to come for lunch on New Year's Eve with an out of town guest. We walked right in and got a table immediately. Our server was very sweet and prompt even though it was a full restaurant. Another guest came to complain to our server that they had not yet been greeted after 10 minutes and a yelling match ensued in the back of the house when she went to get the other table's server. Apparently one server was not pulling his weight and was told to go home. It was actually quite entertaining. 

We had Oxtail loaded fries which was out of this world!  Also had the delicious Brussels sprouts as a shared app/side since the sandwiches are a la cart. We enjoyed every bite of the Banh Mi burger, the Kiki burger and the pork belly steamed buns. I am looking forward to going back to try the noodle bowls. They looked huge and delicious!! Between the three of us, we had cocktails, beer, and a few of their delicious and refreshing teas. 

The four star review would have been a five, but one bathroom was out of order while the other was in disarray, they were out of a few items that we asked for, And because there were seats outside, but apparently the patio was closed. It was a beautiful day out and I love indoor/outdoor options. 

Overall, I can't wait to go back and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to ever write reviews or bash a company but the Bachi burger at windmill and Bermuda has the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. I ordered a burger Togo about a month ago and they gave me the wrong burger. I picked it up before work and realized at work it was covered in Onions and I am Very allergic to Onions! I called back to speak with the manager and he said he would contact me the next day. After a week of waiting for a response I called back again to talk with a different manager. I was then told she would look into resolving my problem. Another week went by and I did the same thing; call and let them know they never got back to me and this happened 2 more times. I ordered a month ago to the day and all I have done is ordered a burger and fries for $28 which I never ate and nobody has ever contacted me to resolve this problem. Do I know if the food is good; No! Would I like to try it again; why would I go somewhere they don't care about the customer and all they do is push you aside. On a scale of 1-10 on how disrespected I feel from bachi burger would rank somewhere in the 100's. Thank you Bachi burger for bringing me to bashing you on yelp but if you had not lied to me 4+ times I would not do this. Have a wonderful Day! You are lucky I have to choose atleast one star:)"}
{"text":"I was never into burgers until I tried this place, now I want to try every single one.   I've tried the Ronin, Kiki, and two others that I forgot the name of but they delish as well.   

The OXTAIL FRIES are yum-to- ok, I think it's the sunnyside up egg that makes it special.  

I'm very excited that they are opening up an L.A. location.   WOOT WOOT!

The PORTUGEUSE DONUTS with COFFEE ICE CREAM are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best burger ive EVER tasted. Everytime im in town in vegas, this is usually my first stop for lunch. Absolutely delicious. Every burger just has so many bursting flavors from the patty to whats with the burger to their sweet bun. 

I usually order the crabby patty, but its not in season. Sooo I ordered the kiki burger (angus beef, with eryngii mushrooms and caramelized bacon) with a side of truffle fries which is just as delicious. But what took me by surprise was the Mr. HO burger which I really need to order next time. Its the burger with a taro bun, I had a bite from my cousins and wow, amazing. 

I genuinely love this place. A family own restaurant and great service. Came here when it just opened and ive been raving about this place so im extremely late on my review. Anyways, excited to have bachi burger open in LA, just hoping its just as good as the original."}
{"text":"Ok maybe I'm being hard on the other locations or maybe I finally found my burger. I've always ordered the spicy miso burger which ain't spicy whenever I go to a Bachi Burger and have occasionally done the kiki, the ronin, and some of their other burgers. They're good but I've never got to excited about eat them. At least that's how I was until I tried the kalbi burger. Don't even know why it took so long for me to try it or was I just blind by the prices of their burgers and too cheap. Anyways the kalbi burger was delicious a messy a little to eat but I'd for sure eat that again. I do love kalbi.

This location is their newest and it has the usual Bachi Burger nice interior, seems about the same size as the original location, has pretty much the same menu, and has the same bill splitting problems. Never made it here when they were HLK or HKL whatever it was but they still had some evidence  of it around. Didn't seem too busy.

As always I like the creativity in the food. If you're not a burger fan try their oxtail fries something their know for."}
{"text":"The oxtail fries are the best chili fries I have ever had.  Ronin burger is also great."}
{"text":"This place is just WOW!  We came here with a group of 7 for dinner and were seated pretty quick.  We ordered a variety of stuff to try - bachi pickles, oxtail chili cheese fries, edamame with truffle oil and garlic, truffle parmesan fries, salt & pepper garlic fries, shogun burger, miyagi-san's wagyu burger, banh mi burger, and ramen.  Everything was just super delicious!  The wagyu burgers were juicy and the ramen broth was very flavorful.  The next time we're in Las Vegas, this is definitely on our list of places to hit up."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my fiancé between meetings. Wish we had time to enjoy the place more. Great vibe and excellent food. The Ronin burger was awesome. A better burger than Umami in LA, which GQ votes the best burger in the country a few years ago. Will be back. Maybe this week."}
{"text":"Burgers are my comfort food.  I decided to try something different. 
Bachi burger... what a burger should taste like.  Big servings. Excellent service. Lots of burger options.  You will not leave hungry
Yum.  And they have beer."}
{"text":"Sad to give it 3 stars because I WANT to love this place. I heard such great things about it, but my personal experience wasn't anything that memorable. The wait time was ridiculously long, but I guess that's understandable considering the popularity of the place. WHEN MY BELLY WANTS FOOD IT WANTS IT NOW.

I tried the Banh-Mi burger and I enjoyed the various flavors (minus the lemongrass) and the juiciness of it. Overall, it was just another overpriced burger. The two other friends I went with also were unsatisfied with their orders.

I'd like to give you another chance though, you're not completely friend zoned just yet."}
{"text":"Every time I come here my tummy leaves more than happy. The food is outstanding. I love the fusion they have created here. The buns are like clouds and all the sauces and condiments are full of flavor. My favorite thing to get are the pork belly steam buns. They satisfy all the cravings. Sweet, salty, crunchy, porky...they're divine. This time I came and had the bone marrow jelly. This surprised me. It was so well balanced. The little salad that came on the side gave the acidic break needed to counter the rich duck fat butter. The bone marrow isn't just marrow it had some meat in it so the actual bone it sits in is more for presentation. (Gorgeous btw. Not complaining) Overall. Excellent food. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the service. Its always pretty crappy. The servers are kinda rude and they're not really excited about the food. I think I asked for plates 3-4 times before they were brought to us. I got refills on 3/4 filled water before I got plates. Just not the greatest. 
I'll keep coming back again and again though. The food is to good not to."}
{"text":"It's been a hot minute since I've been to Bachi Burger! Hunnie Bunnie and I just finished watching Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 next door at Regal and it was either hot dogs at Buldogi's or burgers here and HB picked burgers! 
For starters we ordered the Bachi Pickles - NOT really a fan of these but I did like the garlic and the carrots were OK. Also had to get the shishito peppers! Can't go wrong with these - I love these things! 
And then I moved on to the Pork Belly Steamed Buns and the Shogun Burger, mmm Foie Gras! The steamed buns were REALLY good! I love me some pork belly! My God! And my burgers was definitely a knife and fork burger, lots of toppings and totally messy and really good! The foie gras was so tender and rich! Holy schmokes. 
HB got the kids cheese burger - this entree is great because it comes with the burger, fries AND fruit! 
Nom nom!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the bar right now waiting for my pickup order. When I walked in however ,a couple walked in after me and the hostess seated them right away and basically ignored me . I had to speak up and let them know I was picking up. I've been to the Sahara location dozens of times with my boyfriend and family and i never had a problem. It's been 30 minutes since I called in my order....still waiting. Wow .and I hear the guy talking about other orders saying it's not ready. These locations are worlds  apart.i gave 2 stars rather than 1 because my oxtail fries were pretty good. Too bad the management and customer service sucks. The hostess was a slim girl wit a tattoo on her neck"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the Oxtail Chili fries and it rocks!

Friend and I ended up at Bachi Burger for lunch one of the days we were in Las Vegas. I ended up with the Oxtail chili fries, and he ended up with a burger. Both of us were super happy about our food and enjoyed the experience.

See my other review for the pros/cons of Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a good burgers. Ordered mouth watering Miyagi San & Ronin Burgers, it's delicious!!! Don't miss the Truffles Parmesan Fries & Sweet Potato Fries.  And their Pork belly buns are very tasty. Each person would at least spend $12-20 . A little slow with the service but staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The burgers are crispy and delicious I try to stray away from tofu and mushrooms but the twist on the classic burger with Asian ingredients is a joy to each one of my taste buds."}
{"text":"went to Bachi Burger late one night the last time we were in Vegas.  I used to travel alot following university baseball.  In each town I like to avoid the chains and eat amazing food the locals may know about but the tourists don't.  It was like a quest!  Bachi Burger was the pick in Vegas.  It was delicious!  

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the smell when we walked in.  It was seriously bad.  I told my family, \"it must be the kim Chee\", it smelled like rotting something.  Thank goodness that didn't get us out.  The burgers were fantastic.  We each tried a different one.  We took the waiter's advice and ordered 2 different kinds of fries he recommended.  I don't remember which, but they were both so tasty as were the dipping sauces.  

Service was really friendly and helpful.  I would definitely go back.  We have talked about that smell a few times since.  It was that bad, however, it must have been just that night."}
{"text":"Wanted to give BB a try based on Triple D visit, so we went in on a Saturday evening about 8 pm.
There were 3 empty tables for 2 on the left side of the dining room and the right side was completely empty.
The staff member who greeted us said we would have to wait for a table. HUH??
I pointed out the empty tables to which he replied, \"We do not have enough staff to seat you now.\" 
We were about to leave when another waitstaff person came and sat us immediately.
Once seated the service was fine, but the food was overpriced and unremarkable.
You will be hard pressed to find much oxtail in the salty chili cheese fries and the burgers were nothing to write home about.

PS Why does a half empty restaurant have to have the music so loud that you cannot hear the person across the table from you?"}
{"text":"How could I not have come up with or discover earlier Lap Cheung in burgers?  Lap Cheungs are greasy fatty Chinese sausages.  The cut it up and mix it into the burger.  And now that I know it's a thing, I want it.

Now I'll have to convince someone where I'm from to try making it.

Awesome asian style buns, good service, and plenty of sports on TV.  What else can I ask for?"}
{"text":"We love this place for all the unique flavors you get in their burgers.  In addition, the staff is always friendly and attentive.  A must try if you're a foodie"}
{"text":"Given the fact I'm a plant-eater, naturally I choose the vegetarian option. The No Meat Burger was incredibly delicious! It was a sizable burger with a hearty serving of red onion, tomato, mixed greens, crispy tofu and a medley of grains and vegetables that comprised the patty. There was a sweet and savory glaze which was reminiscent of coconut aminos as well as soy and ginger. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. Wow, those were awesome too! Hot, perfectly cooked for a light crispy texture and sweet, are all the characteristics of a great sweet potato fry. Can't wait to return again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Thank you for another \"awesome meal\", I had the Spicy Miso Burger, my wife had the Market Salad w/a Angus Beef Patty, our son had the Kalbi Burger & we shared the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries., all cooked to \"perfection\". Thanks Josh for the your professionalism & customer service."}
{"text":"Just today a friend swore by I'd and said it's the best burger she ever had. That turned into a challenge so I drove all the way there (15 minutes from the strip). When I got here the place was packed with a long wait line, but that made me more determined to find out if it's just a hipe or is it really that good. 
Had the regular burger with garlic fries and oh boy was it good! The presentation is beautiful and the flavor is like a royalty chef cooked a burger. With my high expectations I wasn't let down at all. It's made the \"best burger ever\" list. 
It's no fast food menu though. Burgers start at $11 and fries start at $4. But you can taste the high end ingredients. 
Wish there was a Bachi Burger closer to where I live. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bachi Burger at 5:00 Saturday night to celebrate completing our taxes.  We chose Bachi Burger after having read many excellent reviews and magazine articles over the past year.  We were quickly seated and ready for our dining experience.

The review and articles were correct.  Bachi Burger is AWESOME!!!!!

Split  the Banh-Mi Burger and the Bachi Fish with the Mrs.   Both were GREAT!!!!!  It will be hard for us to try anything on next trip to Bachi because these sandwiches were so good.  Meat/fish were cooked to perfection and sandwiches were full of flavor.  Simply superb.

The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had and came with a outstanding Citrus Aioli dip.  Yummy!!  Truffle Parmesan Fries also good. 

The Portugese Donuts /malasadas were really good as well.

The servers and staff were very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.  Top of the line service in every way.

Bachi Burger is  wonderful dining experience that I would recommend to anyone with a flair for food adventure in a casual setting at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food was ok but they are pretty slow taking the order and it took forever to get the food. I also heard the employees saying they hate yelpers and that yelpers are crying bitches."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a colleague a few weeks ago. The food was... meh. Nothing bad but for the price I expected much better. I'd come back, but only if someone else was paying the bill..."}
{"text":"Definitely a great, relaxing place the burger was flavorful and juicy honestly a top notch burger - I got the ronin. The staff was great even got to catch with an off work staff that's just how friendly he was. If you're willing to pay for the burger it shouldn't disappoint"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the services because our server was so sweet and nice! The food was a disappointment though. We ordered the oxtail fries which were okay nothing amazing but the calamari was cooked well and crispy and came with two sauces that were flavorful. We ordered two burgers, the Black and Green and the Ranin and both were dry and had no flavor. They looked better than they tasted. There was nothing that I would come back for."}
{"text":"I'll have the miyagi, please; the burger, not the person. That'd be weird. 

When you walk in, it appears to be your average strip mall, Vegas-born burger lounge. But, looks can be deceiving...I mean, haven't you ever looked at a photo of a Big Mac compared to the real thing? 

Burgers are made to order, or you can choose among their expertly crafted selection of gourmet options. The miyagi (if you can't tell) was my poison of choice, and goodness gracious was it worth it. Truffle fries reign at the top of their game, and sit alongside so many different french fries options. But, keep in mind they don't come with your order unless requested. So, request it. 

Also, speaking of miyagi, did I mention that they have ramen? Noodle house/burger joint. Super random concept; brilliant execution. 

Portions are pretty generous, so before you think you can tackle the American/Asian food breed easily--maybe, you should reconsider and back down. Pricing is pleasantly reasonable for gourmet burgers, and definitely won't break the bank in order to stuff yourself. 

Wax on, wax off, Bachi Burger, and keep on fighting with good tastes."}
{"text":"Love this place. Burgers are always on point and the place is always busy.  The wait is worth it and i appreciate the fact that they seat according to the staff on hand. They dont just sit the entire restaurant and slam the kitchen causing the whole place to grind to a halt. I have eaten here multiple times and have had to wait to be seated but its been worth it everytime. My food has always been great. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers.  The quality of the ingredients and how it comes together, makes a very good burger. Oxtail fries is very good too."}
{"text":"So the day's goal of going to Bachi Burger came to a conclusion after visiting our third location. The first was closed due to pest infestation. The second was closed with no notice on the door. The third was open and in close proximity to the strip.

Although that this review is for this particular location, it's hard to not let the unexpected setbacks and disappointment at the two prior locations spill into the review of the third location. However, this Bachi Burger was far from perfect. Service was not terrible. We were seated immediately (mainly because it was empty) by someone helping out in the kitchen. You could tell because she was putting together a dish and wearing latex gloves when she noticed us coming in the front door.

We ordered the spicy miso burger and the kalbi burger. They sounded appealing on the menu, but the fact that the menu was a printed and formatted Microsoft Word document was a red flag. The burgers came out shortly after we ordered. They were artisanal burgers but they lacked in balance of flavor. The spicy miso burger came with swiss cheese, which we substituted for gruyere cheese. However, we were charged as if we had swiss AND gruyere cheese on the burger. The miso flavor was a little funky, resembling an old miso soup. The burger to bun ratio was off, causing the bottom bun to get completely soaked and fall apart halfway through consumption. The kalbi burger had good flavor but again, the bun problem. In addition, the fried egg that came with the burger was cooked over hard, completely eliminating the allure of the runny yolk on a juicy burger.

Lastly, the most frustrating part was that it took about three times as long to have the server collect our check and credit cards than it did for them to take our orders and deliver our food. Looking over, the servers were just shooting the shit and clowning around instead of looking at our raised arm to collect the bill so we could be on our way.

Bonus negative experience for the Christmas decor reminiscent of a lazy elementary school teacher's bulletin board and no functioning lock on the men's restroom door."}
{"text":"I've taken quite a few pictures at Bachi Burger with the intent of eventually posting a review.  Although I still don't have the time to post a \"proper review\", here's something for ya...

Bachi Burger is pretty awesome...

The food here is top notch..the service has always been great for me when I've visited this location.  Personally, I'd order ANY of the burgers and an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  You really can't go wrong...

While not a huge fan of the truffle fries, the sweet potato fries hit the spot.

It's just one of those places where everything you order is good...  So hard to find now-a-days."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I was honestly not very impressed. I felt that my disappointment stemmed from the high expectations that I had for the food and that it was not what I expected.

I have heard about this place from many of my foodie friends who rave about their oxtail fries and burgers. I went a few years back and tried one of their other gourmet fries which was not oxtail fries and that was utterly delicious to me. So upon returning I was determined to try the fries. Being Jamaican I grew up eating amazing oxtail and it is actually one out of two of my favorite foods, fries being the other one. So I came back and ordered the dish and the miyagi burger. The fries are served in a huge portion that you can split with 3-4 people. When I tried it, I didn't even recognize the oxtail, it tasted like chili. It really didn't meet the hype that I've heard about it. The burger on the other hand was really good, but I felt that I've had gourmet burgers like this before and that it was whatever to me. I just really was not impressed with the caliber and taste of their dishes. 

In terms of service, the waiter was helpful and we did not have to wait long for a table. I felt that they weren't as attentive especially when we were looking for our checks. The restaurant has a very modern and clean look to it. We were put in a separate room because it was a big party of us. I felt that we were very separate from everyone else so I don't think I got a good feel of the entire restaurant. But from my perspective, there were a lot of people there yet it was not cramped at all. 

All in all, I do want to give this place another chance. This time I will not have such high expectations and see if I can find the fries that I enjoyed before."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! pretty amazing burgers I really liked the ambiance very family friendly, I was not a fan of the fries but I did like the sauces. I went with a big party so we had pretty much every appetizer in the menu and my favorite was the sausage. The chili fries are huge and could be ordered as a meal but warning, they were a bit spicy. The chicken was alright and the calamari was alright. I had the burger with the fried onions and it was delicious, very flavorful! over all I liked it and the servers were nice."}
{"text":"I recently visited Bachi Burger. I had the Oxtail Chili Fries for the first time, OMFG! I swear I heard Madonna's, Like A Virgin start playing in my head. I told my little boy,\"Back off...this is grow people food\"
I finished the entire plate alone. 
I was glad I took pictures of this beast before I punished it. I still find myself staring at it from time to time...just reflecting on my Oxtail Chili Fries experience. 
Who ever created this dish, you made one fat girl happy."}
{"text":"This might have been 4 stars if we hadn't been so turned off by the service. Our waitress was not very accommodating and tended to ignore us, and the food took about 30-40 minutes to come out after we ordered. If it hadn't been for that, I might have rated this restaurant higher. 

I was excited to try this place and bring my dad because he doesn't venture out to try new places very often. I thought he would like the asian-fusion style burgers and flavors. I was super excited to try the Peking Style Steamed Duck Buns because it's my absolute favorite dish to get when I'm eating at a legit Chinese or Cantonese style restaurant. I didn't expect Bachi Burger's version to be as good, and I was right. Overall, the flavors just didn't work for me (a lot of cilantro, radish, boiled egg, black vinaigrette and BBQ sauce) and the duck didn't taste fresh. Nice effort though. 

My dad tried Kiki's burger, which is angus beef, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, cheese and garlic chili aioli. I can't really recall how this tasted, so it must not have really made much of an impression (doesn't mean it was bad though). I thought that their burgers would be similar in style and flavor to Umami Burger, but luckily their burgers are bigger and seem more filling than Umami's. 

We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which had some black truffle porcini cream on it. It was good, but I love all things fries. Expect burgers to cost around $10 each, which I would say is a fair price. 

Atmosphere-wise, this seems like a fun place to go with a group to watch sports or just eat lunch/dinner. They serve a variety of milk tea/boba drinks also, which is nice. If you're looking for some unique flavor combinations and you have a taste for asian-style cuisine, by all means check this place out. But be prepared for less-than-stellar service, a long wait for your food and don't expect to be blown away by the flavors."}
{"text":"I had been to the location on Windmill a couple times so never got around to going in to the westside location until now.

Consistent food quality  and beverage menu to the other location.

I had the Kiki Burger and truffle parm fries with a bottled craft beer.  The Burger is a great burger.  Asked for med-rare and it came spot on rare.  This was not a big deal for me, but I know it would have been an issue with others.  The fries are great although it's hard to mess up truffle and parmesan  if you cook the fries right.  They were out o the first 3 beers I asked for...not sure if that is normal or an exceptional case.  Additionally the server did not know a lot about the beers.

I don't love the seating in here, but it works for their volume on a busy night.  Service was friendly and food came out quick despite being slightly busy that night.

Still love their buns!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!

Food A++. I tried the Miyagi San and my friend tried the Mr. Ho. We also got to try the  truffle fries. The food was delicious. The burger was well cooked and tasty.

Service was also really good. Our waiter was nice and accommodating. He always made sure that we got what we needed.

A must try if going to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Get your sweatpants on and your oversized pajama shirt ready for this feast because you'll be needing the extra room to fit this baby--burger baby specifically into your belly.

The food is absolutely delicious and heavy. We started out with ox tail french fries and pork belly steamed buns. The ox tail portion resembled more like sauce filled with shreds of ox meat blended in there to give it the goopy texture. I've never had ox tail like this and I'd highly recommend this item if this was the only time you could go here. 

I ordered the Kiki burger and despite not being hungry, finished the entire patty and the contents inside. The buns were only for my visual pleasure. The patty was a heavy Angus beef  with sautéed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. And when I say, heavy, you can feel the weight drop on your hand.

On the scale of gourmet burgers, it ranks very high. For its price, you get the comparable weight of two Big Macs. I may not appreciate that as much, but boy, was it delicious."}
{"text":"I'm seriously not a big fan of burgers, but Bachi is the ONLY burger I'd crave for.  Goodbye In n Out!!! 

Bachi has the most ingredient detailed, marinated patty, and best sauce EVER!!!!!!!!

My friend order the Truffle Parmesan Fries and it was FTN yo! 

I will always throw down money for the cab ride whereever I'm staying in Vegas because there is NO WAY I'm missing out on BACHI!!!

Thanks for making my stomach smile!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once and I'm already hooked. Food is in one word, DELICIOUS. Meat in burgers is juicy and fries are cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Okay food! The only thing I liked was the pork buns. Burgers were okay. I couldn't even taste the ox tail from the ox tail chili cheese fries, no enough meat in it mostly beans. Good service from Jay."}
{"text":"If you saw this place on Triple D go ahead and go. It is as good as advertised. I annihilated my burger.  You know when you go somewhere good and you just stop talking once you bite into the food and don't stop until it is gone? That is Bachi Burger.

I came from San Diego to get it. If you live in Arizona or California it is worth a day trip for any foodie."}
{"text":"Love Kalbi burger! Cook to perfection, delicious taste, served with kimchi and korean style cucumber to clean the palate. Oxtail fries that many guests rave, not sure about this, the bean n oxtail sauce taste off from the can."}
{"text":"Horrible! Just horrible! 
What happened to this place?!?!?
Service is just as bad as the food.
I ordered a beer and water with lemon. No lemon...
Oxtail fries were super soggy watered down with the soupy chili! 
The chicken salad sandwich was yuck! The chicken was hard and old! And way too sweet! Yuck yuck yuck!
Not once did Vina check and ask how's the food? Nope she dropped off my check! And it took forever to pay my check! Then she shorts me $10 on my change! 
She's lucky I left a frikkin $3 tip on a $29 check for one person! It's just really hard for me to stiff horrible servers but I felt like she at least deserved that for dropping off my order to my table! Geezuz. 
Took one bite on that sandwich and picked it apart. What a waste of money. 
Never again. 
So sad because I used to like this place. 
Only takes one...."}
{"text":"We were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait but waited at least 30.  My overall rating is highly satisfied.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 9 on a Saturday night. Previous comments were unhappy on the service but I think the owner listened because we were served in the 30 minutes they told us. They even came out to tell us the previous table has paid and just needs to pack their leftovers.

Food here was up to the hype. I am a big fan of burgers! I had their shogun burger, that's wagyu and unagi with seared foie gras... This burger melted in my mouth. I tasted the buttery foie gras and when I asked for medium, it came out medium so there was no hesitation there. The appetizers were good. I recommend the oxtail fries with an egg over. Truffle fries were good too but nothing extraordinary. 

This will be one of the spots I will come back to everytime I'm here. See you in June for sure!"}
{"text":"One night, an episode of Diners, Drive In, and Dive caught my attention that featured Bachi Burger. Ever since, I knew I had to try it! 
I ordered the Oxtail Chilli Cheese Fries, Steamed Pork Bun, and Black and Green Burger. My god, I've never tasted anything like it. I enjoyed the oxtail chilli fries and steamed pork bun so much! The burger was pretty good! However, it was a little new to me since it was a wagyu beef. Wagyu beef is a grass feed cow. It was a little too lean for my taste, to be honest. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it. 
The place was very friendly and intimate. The food was fairly price. Overall, I had a great experience! I would definitely go back for that steamed bun pork. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Even though I came here with a very large group at almost closing time, the staff was very accommodating to our needs. And because I was in a very big group, I was able to try a few dishes. 

We ordered the Shogun Burger, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Edamame. Both the burger and pork belly had a delicious mix of unique flavors and tender meat, I was impressed. Although it is a little bit of a drive from the strip, it's worth the trip if you have a friend sober enough to drive ;)"}
{"text":"Great food!! Had the Ronin Burger and it was delicious!!! The oxtail chili cheese fries were amazing! It was my 1st time too! Great place and good food!! Just go!!"}
{"text":"I love there ronin and Kiki burger and the truffle fries AWesomE:)"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing! Came here with a group of girls and we pretty much ordered like 6 burgers and tried them all out. My fav was the banh mi, of course. 

I really like the casual and laid back atmosphere however was in a random part of town and in a strip mall. Inside, you feel like you could be in San Francisco or LA."}
{"text":"5 stars, simple as that. The best gourmet burgers I've ever had. There are two locations here in Las Vegas, I usually go to the one in summerlin. Awesome service, good music, good TV shows on (cooking shows and ESPN). Clean classy interior, and most important of all delicious food. Check it out when you can, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Still a fan. I'v been back twice since my last review. My only issue is I ordered my burgers medium and they both have been well done. No pink at all.They still taste good butt I like my medium burger."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is pretty tasty. This location in particular has combined with the ramen place next door so they also serve ramen and other dishes here of the Japanese culture. On the Bachi Burger side of the menu, gotta give some credit to their oxtail chili fries. 

Oxtail Fries are definitely a shareable portion - eat them alone and you may or may not be too full before you touch your burger. 

Burger-wise. There are angus and waygu beef options, waygu is 3/4 dollars more expensive. Well constructed and tasty burgers here!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the Food Network last year... I go to Vegas every 2 months and something always comes up to distract me from going. Insisted we go this trip. Was it good? Hell yeah!! Was it epic? Nahhh. Pros: Great burger my goodness! Great menu... less is definitely more (on the menu)... good sign of a great food establishment.  Hate to see a 4 page menu of a bunch of silly stuff...ranging from chicken wings to liver and onions...geeeze... just give me the goods! Fresh ingredients! Ok a couple of us had the famous burgers...fried eggs 'n all. Wow! I had the spicy miso ramen. Enough for 2.. as authentic as you can get too... omg was it tasty. The \"regular\" spicy is perfect along with the \"house hot sauce. I think the \"extra spicy\" soup may have been a tad too hot for me. We tried the listed parmesan garlic fries,  and onion rings (not on menu) they were tasty!  The cons, hence the missing star: busy busy busy which can be a great sign, but it's too small. This place deserves a larger place, not sandwiched in a tiny corner strip mall connected to subway. Wait at 3pm (to me that should be an \"off time of day) was 45 minutes for 5 of us. Most tables are for 2, maybe a couple for 4. Prices were okay for appetizers.. too much for ramen and burgers.  Burgers were tasty as heck but on the smaller side..Come on people.. $18 for a bison burger? Sure in a cool location at a popular casino.. but not in a corner strip mall.  All In all great food. One tip.... move your rat trap from the front door by the trashcan... to another location. In the States this isn't a good sign.  *Revised Update: Just found out they were closed down for roaches or something. Sometimes I think they cant avoid it in a outdoor strip mall...Darn it, wanted to go one more time.  I believe there is another location somewhere!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy and the customer service is great.  We came late at night which was great b/c they open till really late!  I really enjoyed the Lonely Burger... I think that's what it was called...  And they have amazing sweet potato fries with their house sauces.  I must come back to try other burgers b/c they have a huge selection.

Oh, and when we left, we got some of their chocolate brittle to go which is also very tasty!"}
{"text":"Our food was delicious; the Banh mi burger was terrific and the vegetarian burger with layers of goodies was a stand out for the no meat crowd. Recommend the truffled parmesan fries with sun dried tomato dip. They delivered on every level: food,service, and variety. It's nice to see their noodle restaurant  going in next door on East Windmill."}
{"text":"After a long drive from San Diego, we finally made it to Bachi Burger. We come to this location all the time. It's one of our go to stops in Vegas.

Dan C. was our waiter. Seems like he is always our waiter when we come (once a year). He's very friendly and on top of it. He checks on you and makes sure you're okay with your drinks and food. Very fast and efficient guy. We liked him a lot!

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - We always get these. It's topped with a fried egg and runny eggs make everything better! Fries were perfectly crisp. Chili had a nice flavor and the touches of jalapeño peppers gave it the nice kick. 

Miyagi Burger - Fried egg and onion rings. Yum! We got this to split today because we are doing an all you can eat thing tonight but if we got two (like usual), we would also get the Ronin Burger. Meat was juicy and it had an Asian marinade taste to it. Onion rings were nice and crispy. Runny egg topped it off. 

We would definitely recommend this place and will continue to return when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is a place I hit up when in Vegas, but I do like their other location much better than this location.  This one is much smaller.  I am not a red meat eater, so I opted for the 3 steamed pork belly bun.  I thought it was good, but living in the Bay Area, we have a food truck that serves the same thing.  I wish they served chicken or  turkey burger with any of substitute of the red meat burgers.  I never asked, but maybe they do..next time.  Always a fan here, just the other location."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day and did enjoy it. Love the concept for an Asian fusion burger joint.  The menu had a wide array of unique choices that you can't find anywhere else.  If you love beef, there are many choices for you.  Unfortunately, I don't eat beef (sometimes I do, but have not ate a hamburger in over 10 years).  They did have a a ground chicken / turkey called the lost bird and I have to say it was huge and good.  The bun they used is not your typical burger bun, but what u get when ordering a baked pork bun, if you ever had it.  I loved the bun they used.  Good twist to make it an Asian fusion burger.  

Great place and would come back again."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is our go to place for burgers in Vegas.  This is their 3rd location in Vegas and it is smaller like the first (I do prefer the one in Summerlin - bigger).  I don't beef much so everytime I come here, I always get their fish or ground chicken / turkey burger (Lone some bird), so my choices were limited.  I decided to ask the waitress if I can get the ronin burger and instead of beef, to replace it with the chicken / turkey patty - she said \"sure!\".  I guess you can replace any of the beef burgers with with another type patty.  We also ordered the \"just fries\" which includes the banana ketchup.

The staff was alittle slow here, but they acknowledged it which is good they can admit that, and they were friendly.  There was only 3 people on the floor so understandable they were alittle slow to get to us.

Overall, a good experience and always good burgers."}
{"text":"Server lost order. That happens, hopefully not often. Manager and server very apologetic and comped the food but found the food when it finally arrived to be just ok. Salt and pepper fries warm, mediocre at best. Two burgers were ok. Looked better than they tasted, a little greasy. Seems overrated."}
{"text":"If this were based on the food alone, I would have easily given 5 stars. However, the service is severely lacking. The other half and I have been here on multiple occasions, and never once received good service. Today's saving grave was the bus boy, who went out of his way to ensure we had everything we needed and always did it with a smile!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the one near the theater with the unfinished parking lot and this one is noticeably better.

had a nice revelation with the oxtail fries and the ronin burger was just what the doctor ordered.

really enjoyed the menu offerings but one knock was the lack of shrimp chips because apparently they stopped serving them.

bring back the kropek!"}
{"text":"Came in around 5:30 yesterday and it wasn't as busy like the last  time I came into this restaurant but it was steady. A very friendly young Asian lady had greeted us and had asked us to give her a few minutes to set up a table. From the way it looked there was only a couple servers and the hostess who had greeted us. Our waiter Kevin was amazing and explained everything on the menu. Our food came out in a perfect time and everything that we tried on the menu was amazing. My group and I had oxtail, miyagi, black&green, and the lamb burger.  This place is a must try. Every time I'm in Vegas, I always enjoy their food! Very friendly staff and amazing food."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night as I was craving a good burger. Walked in and the place was almost empty - at 6:30 pm! Made me wonder.......  So, I was seated promptly and was advised that tonite was cash only as their computers were down. No worries. I ordered a glass of Malbec which they were out of, so I asked for a $9 glass of Cabernet. When the waiter brought it to me I couldn't believe how small the pour was. The glass was a short wine glass to begin with, and I would say that he poured barely 5 oz of wine it. Decided to order the $8 angus burger with cheddar added for $1.50. Since no sides came with this $9.50 burger, I ordered regular fries which came with pineapple ketchup for $3.50. I asked for extra ketchup and the waiter replied \"regular ketchup?\" so I replied \"sure\".  The burger came and was cooked to my liking and I have to say that it was delicious! Not \"$9.50 delicious\" but still very good! The fries came after my burger and was a decent sized order. Waiter brought one small side of pineapple ketchup and one regular. I loved the pineapple ketchup and asked for extra but was told that it was .50 for extra. I said no thanks as the $3.50 was already enough for plain fries. Also, I had to send the first side of regular ketchup back as it tasted old or was a very cheap brand. The waiter brought back ketchup from a different container and said they use Heinz. It was fine. 
The service was very good and the burger was very, very tasty. However, my bill came to $23 which is crazy for a burger and fries and a 4oz glass of wine. Sorry, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Came on a Monday night and the place was packed, 30 minute wait. Ordered the Miyagi burger, oxtail chili cheese fries and the duck in steamed buns. Service was polite but really slow. I don't blame them though, they were obviously understaffed. Burger was pretty good, the fries were overrated and the duck buns/tacos was underwhelming. I think next time I'll just order takeout to skip the wait and get burgers only."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
Has a great vibe with a great staff. We ordered a ton of food, all different items.

OX tail chili cheese fries are amazing!!

I have tried almost everything on their menu... You honestly can't go wrong no matter what."}
{"text":"+ Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger 
+ Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries

I enjoy fusion burgers and this place doesn't disappoint. The Miyagi burger was very flavorful and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries were the perfect compliment to my burger. The food was good and the service was good."}
{"text":"good place. Make sure you ask up front what they are out of though. Both times after ordering 2 things we were told they were out of items. I like the variety of burgers."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. We started off with the chili fries happy hour special for $6. Amazing! Both of our burgers were great and cooked perfectly. Best burgers in town for a affordable price. Great service too!"}
{"text":"soft fluffy sweet taiwanese bun loaded with meat, veggies, and sauces.  bachi burger does a nice \"fusion\" style burger with great flavors and textures.  the soft sweet bun gives some sweetness and makes the burger feel light overall.  
got the ronin burger, which was delicious.  yuzu aioli was a nice citrusy creamy addition to the burger.  coleslaw added the crunch.  it was topped with an egg, and everything is better with a fried egg! only negative was that the yolk was completely cooked.  wouldve liked some sexy yolk spillage on my burger!

other fusion styles include banh mi burger, oxtail fries, pickles, etc.  definitely a place to visit and go back for more."}
{"text":"To begin with I should probably mention I already had a negative bias against Bachi after having called on a Sunday and wanting to place a takeout order and being told \"No, they are not accepting take out orders Today\". Ok, of course I was wondering just what that means...they don't accept takeout orders on sundays because of the sabbath or something? Makes zero sense but whatever. So the next day I decide to give them a second shot. I call again and ask to place a takeout order. The hostess or whoever answers the phone, says she is not sure if they are not taking takeout orders and i ask WHY NOT. She says some BS about it depends on how busy they are and she will check. So I'm on hold for 2 mins while she probably figures out how to ask such a simple question to her mgr or whoever and gets on the line and tells me they'redoing takeout orders. Well praise the Lord, my trip to vegas is now complete since I get to have one of your stupendous culinary creations...not. It could be the fact that it's takeout...but I doubt it since I only had to drive less than 10 mins back to my hotel. The kiki burger was ok. The parm fries were ok. Chicken caesar was ok. Kalbi burg was ok. of course I did not eat all of these...this is based on others' input. Like I said, the initial contact often can make or break one's opinion just like in a job interview and that might have been the case here. I have no prob paying good money but I expect good food along with good service...or at least one of the two. From this Bachi, I would say i received mediocre of both. Sad to say I would not return here and rather go to KGB or one of the other high priced burg joints on the Strip even."}
{"text":"OMG, THE FOOD IS AMAZING!  Very crowded with long waits. Definitely worth the wait. The Shogun burger with foie grad was UNBELIEVABLE!  YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY.  Recommend pickles,  ox tail fries, Portuguese doughnuts.  Full bar is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Service is crap. We got here and waited 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us in the slightest. 

After they did, we were put on the wait list although the restaurant was clearly not full. So we waited about 10 minutes to be seated. 

We eventually placed our order and almost a full hour after we arrived, we were served with food. 

Whe it came, the food was decent. I had a myagi-San burger which was good but I would have been happy with a saltine cracker at that point. Maybe if I come back in a couple of years I'll get to see what it tastes like when I'm not in a ketonic hangry rage."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food. Best part is the great prices and the awesome service. When you're Vegas this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"If you live in Vegas, you NEED to come here (and damn you for being so lucky!).  If you're visiting Vegas, you NEED to come here.  It's seriously worth the little distance you drive from the strip.  And if you don't have a car, CAB it here, it's worth it, I promise!!!

BH took me here because we needed a break from all the celeb chef restaurants on the strip and wanted something a little more low key with dishes at reasonable prices.  What I did not expect was that the food would be as good as the $$$$ restaurants with a $$ price!!  

The restaurant is very clean, spacious, and nicely decorated.  The waitress we had was very helpful and awesome.  We sat down and perused the menu, and we immediately spotted about 10 things we wanted.  We whittled the list down to a mere 5 dishes. . .the foie gras appetizer, the oxtail chili cheese fries, the kiki burger for BH, the Ronin burger for me, and a side of truffle parmesan fries. We finished it ALL.

The foie gras appetizer is only $12.50 and comes with salty mushrooms, sweet golden raisins, a beautiful reduction sauce and plump, juicy figs.  The foie gras was seared perfectly so it was crisp on the outside and soft and luscious inside.  Each bite rendered pockets of fragrant fat to explode in my mouth and coupled with the sweet raisins and juicy fig, I was on cloud 9.  The pieces of foie gras were also quite big. . .and for $12.50 I thought it was a steal! 

The oxtail chili cheese fries were my next favorite. . .though it came a VERY close second to the foie gras.  The fries were golden and crispy, and very soft and fluffy on the inside.  The oxtail was so tender and almost melted in my mouth.  I don't like beans in my chili but I did not mind the beans in this chili.  It gave it a nice, creamy texture to the crunchy fries that was different from the gooey cheese.  The jalapenos were crisp and gave each bite a little heat, which offset the slightly sweet and salty chili, and the cilantro kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  Oh god, it was pure heaven. . .BH and I cleaned the plate and eagerly awaited our burgers.

BH's Kiki burger was pretty good.  I am not a big fan of mushrooms but his was very flavorful, the meat was perfectly cooked (we ordered medium rare. . .the meat was browned on the outside and pink THROUGHOUT the entire patty!) the bacon strips were candied, sweet, and chewy, and the bun was soft and pillowy.  BH commented that the bread reminded him of cha shu bao - asian style where it's very light and fluffy, golden brown on top and just a tad sweet.  I agreed and felt the bun really made their burgers.

My Ronin burger was just okay.  I was a little disappointed that it lacked a bit of flavor, imo, but I think it may have been because I had foie gras and oxtail chili cheese fries before the Ronin, so my palate might've been built up to expect something more. However, I think if they put bacon in the Ronin, it'd made it even better than it already is.  But I think if I had the Ronin without all the luscious apps, I would've thought it was perfect.  The meat, like the KiKi, was cooked medium rare, it was juicy with the soft, golden bun and the fried egg. . .it was a true delight to eat.  BH and I could tell they also put a lot of thought and time into their sauces, which came out very interesting and paired well with the burgers and fries.


The truffle parmesan fries were really good as well.  Like the oxtail french fries, they were crisp, golden brown, and had a nice, subtle flavor of white truffle with a bit of tangy parmesan.  It went with our burgers quite well.

I was so impressed with the meal, I flagged down our waitress and begged her to talk to the owner so they could open a Bachi in LA.  She said the owner is in the works and is hopefully opening one by the end of next year!  I nearly jumped for joy.  She also mentioned that the chef/owner used to work at Roy's Hawaiian and just started Bachi.  They plan on opening a ramen house in a few months, also in Vegas.  Ramen is abundant in LA, but I feel we have a lack of great burgers, especially Asian fusion burgers.  

Overall, I felt the burgers were like a combo of Umami (in terms of creativity and presentation) + Bun Bun (for the Asian- fusion style flavor).  Bot Bachi blows both out of the water. . .by far. 

The bill was just a little under $50.  BH exclaimed that it \"wasn't right\" because he felt he was somehow cheating them.  $50 for 5 dishes. . .each made with such precision and skill as a $$$$ restaurant???  It was the best meal EVER.  I understand prices in LA might be a bit more, but I don't care.  I just want my Bachi!!!"}
{"text":"One of the great burgers of Las Vegas.  But I want to tell you guys something that I haven't heard anyone else mention.  Yes they're is a list of specialty burgers you can get, and obviously people love them.  (ie the Ronin, Kiki, Banh Mi, etc.)  but I seriously recommend you build your own burger.  I feel like a lot of the ingredients take away from the greatness of the beef in the burger.  Sometimes simpler is better, less is more.  Go with the Kobe, so good.  I'm thinking about it right now, want it so bad!"}
{"text":"Kiki burger was out of this world great...really!  I consider myself a hamburger connoisseur and Bachi was top notch!  Plus they freshly ground their beef so it's totally safe to actually get a burger RARE - my favorite!"}
{"text":"Went late on a Tuesday night before a movie. There was tons of parking (but that seems pretty standard in Vegas), service was fast and friendly.

Being a friendly neighborhood vegetarian, of course I went for the \"no meat here\"...burger. It was pretty delicious! I really enjoyed the way that they layered ingredients like fried tofu, and eggplant, rather than just giving you a veggie patty on a bun. Overall, the ingredients seemed to be of good quality.

Its always awesome when places offer delicious veggie options in addition to the usual carnivorous fare."}
{"text":"I always wanted to come here, after watching the triple D show! We had wagu burger and pork belly steam buns, they were ok. We ordered two fries and one was good enough for two people, Our server could have told us that. It Didn't seem too busy, but the orders did come out slow -_-
For a burger, I've had better.
Truffle fires were soggy and cold."}
{"text":"It was fortunate I was in Las Vegas for a business trip.  My brother mentioned how great Bachi burger was and I had to stop by.  He recommended the Alaskan Cod burger and the Ox Tail chili cheese fries.  The best burger I've eaten so far.  My friend had a Wagyu burger (name of the burger escapes me).  Although the Wagyu burger was great tasting as well, the Alaskan Cod burger felt light and had a great taste to it.  

The buns on the burger were soft.  Although the burger has a tall look, you can press it down to fit into your mouth.  

 I didn't find anything special with the Ox tail chili cheese fries.  

I will get one of these burgers every time I stop by Vegas."}
{"text":"Looks better than actually taste. Personally was not a fan of the oxtail fries. Chili was overpowering, fries were very salty. Alotta flavors going on. All I could taste was bbq. Burger was fairly decent. Cooked well but have had better. Would I eat here again? Maybe. I am not going to say no but I have plenty of other options before I return here."}
{"text":"We all loved what we each ordered:  'Duroc Pork Belly', 'Black & Green Burger' & 'Ronin Burger'., sooo \"ono\" And  so was the french fries.... yum.  The chef came out to check on our satisfaction which was a nice touch.  I did read the reviews prior and was a bit skeptical about dining at this location but we are glad we did.  And being a coffee connoisseur, I must say the coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Thus was my first time coming here and the burger was amazing. The meat is infused with different flavors and is packed with so many things."}
{"text":"This place is cutely tucked away in a little niche! Upon entering the restaurant I was unfortunately not greeted by the hostess, although she was standing there speaking with what seemed to be her friend. (Who almost hit us with her car in the parking lot by the way) The servers there were superb. One rushed to the door after the hostess \"ignored\" us and sat us. The experience from there forward was amazing! Food was emmaculate as well as presentation! I definitely will come back here regardless of the hostess who was inattentive."}
{"text":"Another DDD stop! AND....Another repeater!

WOW, top 5 burger I have ever had for sure! The truffle fries paired perfectly as well. I will definitely be back and this is a must stop.

My burger came with bacon and mushrooms and they were cooked so well, I mean sooooo well. I had not eaten mushrooms cooked that way before and it was just perfection!"}
{"text":"We had a very animated server who kinda reminded me of the comedian Bobby Lee. 
The burgers were tasty and they reminded me of a better version of Fuku Burger. I'd go back if I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had to write a review because this location has the best service out of all the Bachi burgers!

Right when we walked in, we were greeted by chef Chris (who I did not know he was the chef at the time.) He welcomed us, sat us down, and gave us a little history and background on Bachi Kitchen. Got our drinks started and our server came shortly after.

Our server was very polite and anticipated our every need. We ordered the usual. Oxtail chili cheese fries and the Spicy miso burger. Also tried the crab dip, which was amaze balls. 

At the end of our meal, the Chef came back to check on us. I was like wow, not many chefs take the time to do that kind of thing. This guy must genuinely care about his guests. And the cool thing I learned about this location is that they serve breakfast all day! 

I'll definitely be coming back here when we visit again. :)"}
{"text":"Left atfter no service...waitress came up and asked us wjo sat us....the proper response would be to say I will get aomeone to rake yiur order...this place sucks"}
{"text":"We are now bonafide Bachi burger addicts.  Me and hubby both live the Kiki and parmesan fries.  These burgers are huge, and I get full half way through the burger.  But it is soooo good, I eat it 'til it's gone.  It is pricey, but hey, it's gourmet style.  You want cheapy asian infused burger, go join them teeny boppers at the fuku truck and wait forever!  Lol jk."}
{"text":"Can I please die and go to Bachi Burger heaven!!! I planned an all week birthday celebration in Vegas and this was a MUST do along the way. If you're in town, do yourself a favor and make sure that you stop in. Since there were 12 of us we had everything--and there wasn't a single disappointment. My favorites were the cheese fries with Oxtail and the pork belly steamed buns...NEXT level amazing. The Banh-Mi, Crusty Crab, and Miyagi-san were also crowd favorites.

The service was great. They handled the big party easily and we even did birthday shots and singing with our server. They offered us great recommendations on drinks and desserts and though we were dubious of the pop tarts but they were great and the donuts took the cake and sealed the deal. Bachi Burger has a permanent place in every Vegas itinerary. Can't wait for more!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I think this product is going downhill, slowly.  We used to love going here.  Great food, great facility, etc.  Most recent visit:
1.  Men's bathroom door would not lock (single user).  Mentioned it to the waitress - got deer in the headlights look - no manager visible to get message to.  At least put a hanging sign on the door to give the next user a heads up it is occupied.
2.  Back up bathroom (on the noodle side) has a door that squeaks to high heaven, and it wasn't that clean.
3.  Music was too loud - politely mentioned this to our waitress (nice enough).  She said she would see what she could do (which was apparently nothing).
4.  Ordered the spicy pickles, which we do love.  BUT, they arrived right when our main courses were arriving, NOT when expected (as an appetizer).  Fail.
5.  Food was up to standards, but it is just not worth going through the hassle when everything is not up to speed.
Just my opinion."}
{"text":"I can understand everyone's frustration coming here. Just a slight disfunction somewhere within one department can make a difference in your food or experience. But I want to give a shoutout to the Filipino guy working as a hostess, busser and server. He made us laugh and all the servers took care of us tonight. They all were bussing their asses tonight because they were understaffed. And everyone knows you have to work extra hard to make customers happy when you have to pick up slack. Our food took a little longer then usual but they still delivered and food is always great here. With better management I think this place can pick themselves back up and become the excellent restaurant they were before! Salamat bachi burger!!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger place in the Summerlin Area in Las Vegas. Although I believe that they have two other locations in the area. The restaurant is spacey with plenty of space, and the waiters were helpful and quick with service.

For the food, I ordered the Miyagi-San grass fed wagyu burger, with a side of salt & pepper garlic fries. The fries were well seasoned and crispy as well as decent size (was able to feed to two people). The burger was amazing, cooked to my liking, and juicy. It came with an egg on it which I absolutely love. Overall the flavors of the burger  mixed well together and was delightful. Definitely recommend if you have a craving for a burger."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger restaurants in Vegas! They have all sorts of burgers (my personal favorite is the turkey burger) including options for vegetarians that are amazing as well. Love their truffle fries and they have a lot of varieties of boba tea as well. Perhaps the most shocking part of the whole experience is that it is moderately priced. They could easily charge way more for their food and keep it pretty reasonable. Service is always great as well. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Overpriced Burger King Burgers.  It's like they thought \"what crap can we put on our burgers to cover the nasty taste of our burgers\".  Some tips, don't press or poke the burgers and they wont be dry, SEASONING and lastly most people like there cheese melted no COLD.  I can see why you only have one review, No one even wants to take the time to write bad crap about you or they have and you have had them removed.  LOL either way GOOD LUCK your going to need it with those burgers."}
{"text":"Rarely do I give 5 stars to any place but this is a great burger place. My friends and I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork belly sliders and Chicken nuggets thing for our starters. The pork belly sliders we could've done without but the other two, were freaken tasty as hell! The fries were tasty to another level, The chicken nuggets things were so good, I pretty much ate the whole plate by myself. 

I ordered the Ronin burger which had all kinds of delicious on it! It had an egg, cole slaw, onions and all kinds of other stuff that I can't remember! It was too good. Everyone should come here and eat here!!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST!!! Everything about bachi burger is amazing!!

Oxtail fries, Miyagi san's burger, the master less ronin burger, and the kalbi burger was PERFECT.

We came during lunch time so the crowd wasn't too crazy. The last time I came it was in the evening and this place was packed and now I see why.


I ordered the oxtail fries and Miyagi san's burger. The burger was coined to perfection and I asked the waiter to cook my egg over hard with NO runny yoke and that he did. The burger was flawless. 

The oxtail fries were soooooooo good!! I accidentally ate a pepper and burned my tongue but it was worth it. 

Bachi burger ruined every other burger joint for my bf. He loves burgers and could eat it everyday and now he compares other burgers to bachi burger. 

I will be back to this place and with more of my family and friends!!!

Mahalo to the bachi burger staff for being on your A game and giving us incredible service and amazing tasting food. I'll see you in September.."}
{"text":"If the owner reads this - WE NEED BACHI BURGER IN HAWAII!!! I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 13 years I'll help you open the bachi burger. 

EVERYTHING is made to perfection. The consistency is precise at any of the locations you go to from Vegas to California. WE NEED THIS IN HAWAII!!

I ALWAYS get the Mr Miyagi burger and it always satisfies me. My boyfriend LOVES the Ronin burger. WE NEED THIS IN HAWAII... PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Had the wagu burger with friend egg and caramelized bacon. I can't get over the bacon, was amazing and the egg was very well done. Truffle fries are a must and you can't leave without the pineapple ketchup. Service was good but could have been better. Wasn't easy to find this place. I'd probably go back for the bacon but that's it."}
{"text":"Service is very good! Lots better than the Henderson location.. Our server was very knowledgable about the food! The black and green burger is a must try item as well as the pan fried edamame!"}
{"text":"A bunch of colleagues and I went to Bachi burger today for their going aways (last days) with our company. With a party of 10 we were still quickly seated. We had waters served all around and tried the strawberry lemonade 5/5 delicious.

For appetizers we sampled the truffle Parmesan fries with sun dried tomato sauce 4/5 and the salt and pepper fries 4/5. We also got one order of the Peking style duck steam buns 5/5.

For entree's we ordered the miyagi-San wagyu beef burger 5/5, ronin burger 4/5, tonkatsu spicy ramen 5/5. All the burgers were delicious and the fried egg made them just right. One of us also tried he bachi fish burger, the furikake pan seared cod was tasty and came with plenty of tartar sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion and a bubu arare sauce.

Jasmine was a very attentive server and kept our waters filled and tended to our every need 5/5.

Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Another good burger in vegas!  If you haven't been to Bachi burger, I strongly suggest it.  The Kobe burger is my recommendation.  It's juicy and tastes amazing!   The burger was cooked perfectly.  I also suggest the black and white milkshake.  Service was great, the only problem is the wait.  This is very popular right now, so expect a 20-30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I came across Bachi Burger after watching a film at the movie theater next door. A couple co-workers told me how great Bachi Burger is so I decided to try it out. In all honesty, I have no idea what all the buzz is all about. The food was mediocre in flavor and their shakes are mediocre. I don't think I'll be coming back after reading one reviewer having issues getting a $1.50 cole slaw removed from their bill. Restaurants who would rather nickel and dime their customers instead of trying to win their loyalty doesn't get my business. I can choose another place to get my burger fix."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time trying Bachi burger and it's definitely not my cup of tea. AT the time when we walked in, our server asked us for some patience because she was the only person working the floor and 4 groups including ourselves walked in at the same time. We weren't in a rush so it was fine, but I think its odd that they only keep 1 person at the front of house. 

 The burger meat was heavily marinated and all you taste when you bite into the burger is burnt marinate. The burger was also incredibly oily. I also tried the doughnuts for dessert and that was totally forgettable. I took one bite of the dessert and left it at the table. It was like a doughnut you would get at the grocery store and not freshly made. The menu price for the doughnuts is 5 dollars but our wonderful server charged us 6. Nice!"}
{"text":"One of the best casual places I've eaten at in recent memory. When I heard \"Asian-inspired burgers\" I was scratching my head, but man, does this place knock it out of the park.

My husband and I shared the pork belly buns - sheer perfection with an absolutely addictive dipping sauce. We also split the Kiki  burger, which is topped with a garlic chili aioli, caramelized bacon, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, a sweet onion marmalade and melted Gruyere cheese. The burger is glazed with a delicious coating and came together beautifully. 

The food was so good, I was still thinking about it the next day and craving more. I would love to go back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"As my first official yelp review, Bachi Burger definitely earns the privilege of being the \"first\"! 

We went for to Bachi Burger during the lunch rush house madness however I only waited about less than 10 minutes to get seated. I went ahead and ordered for my bf as he always gets a usual burger (ketchup and mustard only) regardless of where he is eating. I ordered a protein style medium well with avocado burger. 

I would hands down say this has been the best protein burger I've ever had. I was a bit skeptical about order a protein burger as I didn't not maybe reviews on me. But I was definitely not disappointed. Great Asian infused flavor. I also ordered the aioli fries and he got regular fries. bomb.com !
My bf was very satisfied with his \"plain\" burger, and he's definitely the pickier one. He always a says that a \"good burger doesn't need so many ingredients\". He even filled out the survey! 

Overall great place. It might be a bit more pricier, but you get what you pay for! Did I mention that they automatically gave us military discount without asking. (He came in uniform) from work. Good customer service and great food! Must try :)"}
{"text":"The burger was good, but 12$ per burger, are you serious? My friends ordered 3 burgers, 12$,12$ and 16$, 40$ for 3 burgers was ripped off, and for the mocha powder tea 4$?  It was too expensive, I would recommend in and out burger. I am surprised people still goes there."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a typical American.  So, yah, my favorite sandwich is a hamburger.  When you come into Vegas, your burger choices are huge.  And many of them are great.  Don't miss this one.  It can get crowded due to Triple D's popularity, but it gets crowded because its damn good.  If you're with a group, always get the Ox Tail Fries.  That's a meal in itself.  Ox Tail Chili, cheese and a fried egg on top of a mound of crispy fries.  That's enough for me to come back.  Then the burger.  So far, I tried 3 different ones and so far I don't have a favorite because they were all great.  They can get messy, but you know you want to lick the deliciousness off your hand any ways."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger places in town! I have been here about ten times in the past couple months probably, and I am still satisfied and trying everything on the menu!  If you like the whole Asian-style burgers, you will have to try this! Oh, and don't forget to try the Oxtail chili-cheese fries! To die for!!"}
{"text":"I love burgers
I love Asian food
I guess I don't like Asian flavored burgers
Oxtail cheese fries were good but definitely over rated"}
{"text":"We decided to check out Bachi Burgers while visiting friends in Vegas.  First the good stuff.  The service was great, quick and friendly.  Our server also advised us to put our orders in ahead of a larger party which helped is get our food sooner.  The food was mix.  We ordered the sausages and Peking duck steam buns as appetizers.  Both were delicious.  The oxtail chili fries were greasy and salty.  A big let down! We also ordered 3 burgers.  They were over cooked and too sweet.  The plantation teas was way too sweet.  We may give Bachi a second try next time with are in Vegas.  For now, Bachi gets an \"average\" Rating."}
{"text":"As far as the gourmet burger movement goes this place takes a unique approach. I love the Asian-flavor inspired burgers. Everything about the meal was delicious. Great fries, my burger was cooked perfectly and the service was great. It's also nice being able to get a gourmet burger without having to go down to the strip. I definitely recommend this spot if you like burgers."}
{"text":"Well this is probably the last time I will come here.

We arrived with a party of 6 @ around 7:40pm, on 7/26. Was greeted by an asian female, that stated she was having someone training tonight, a male with short hair, (from Hawaii, because he mentioned he was from there)

Anywho the female trainer stated they could only split checks 2 ways. The girl stated she was going to split the check into 2 ways. Not really what we wanted since there 3 couples. 

We ordered our burgers and it took approximately 20-30 mins to receive it. It would've nice to get an update instead of just silence.

After we were done, it took them about another 20 mins to realize we wanted the check. Then the entire bill was on 1 check, we asked Hawaiian dude to split it and he comes with 3 checks! HOLY CRAP, looks like you can split it 3 ways! Either A, trainer girl didn't wanna do the extra work or B, she herself didn't know how to do it. 

It took a ridiculous 30 mins for them to run the cards for each check. Again no updates on why they were taking so damn long. The girl then explained afterwards on why they took so long, complications with using cash and card, different POS, blah-blah-blah. Next time don't let a customer wait for an entire tv episode. Be attentive!

We saw you guys avoiding eye contact!

So we spent an unnecessary 2 hrs at a fast casual burger place. Bachi Booty."}
{"text":"This would have been 5 stars for me, however the wait/service was a -1.

We came here on a week night and the place was packed! Wait time was about 45min - an hour. The hostess, if you can call her that, was running around like a chicken with its head cut off: one minute she's taking your number, then she's busting the table, next thing you know she's taking orders at the table...

We decided to take a seat at the bar after about 30 min of waiting. (Some lady had been there waiting for over an hour now for a table!) Like I had mention, the service definitely needs improvement. It was awhile before we got ourselves a menu, and even longer before our order was placed. 

When our food finally arrived, it was DELICIOUS! I am usually not a hamburger person but the Kiki Burger won me over! I love the mushrooms, especially the shiitake mushroom. It was so juicy! And the angus beef was also very flavorful!

The only thing I can say is: Hire more waiters!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing it on \"Triple D\" and it definitely lived up to the hype.  The burgers are incredibly juicy and the buns are out of this world.  Their chili cheese fries are very good and their saki sangria is fantastic.  Have been back three times already and definitely recommend it.  Although now that the word is out, it is usually very busy so you have to be patient but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We've been twice now and we might need to make this mandatory for every Las Vegas visit. Our first visit we weren't sure what to expect and were pleasantly surprised. I don't remember what exactly we ordered, but judging from our most recent visit EVERYTHING IS good. Our first visit it was pretty packed, second visit not as much, but when we sat down several more tables started showing up. Our first visit we had great service, this second time not as good unfortunately. It wasn't as bad but our waitress wasn't very attentive but there may have been a possibility she was waiting a couple of tables as well as bar tending. On to the food, we shared the chili garlic wings, oh my gosh. Honestly, we both could have gotten our own order of wings and been very very happy, we shared and were still quite happy. I got the burger with Kimchi and subbed for a wagyu burger, it was delicious! We also shared an order of fries which were pretty good as well. I love that you can add an egg to any burger, that just puts it over the top. Whatever you get here you'll enjoy, love this place. (Yelp LA Challenge #14 of 100)"}
{"text":"Came here on friday. One of the best burgers I have had ever. 30 Minute wait well worth it. I had the spicy miso burger and truffle fries. This burger is damn good with the right amount of flavor and spices. If you are in town give this place some \"aloha\" and stop by. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"Loved food here. We ordered fish burger, fried calamari and spicy miso ramen noodle soup. I loved the noodle soup and burger. Definitely going back there with more frns next time Im in Vegas."}
{"text":"If your coming from out of town like me (cali) and going to Vegas this is definitely  a place to stop by. Really good burgers and the ramen as well. 
Prices are good and the wait time isn't too bad."}
{"text":"1st time coming here for me yesterday with Hubby.  He had been before though on previous trip.  For drinks we had Thai teas (those were creamy & delicious, not overly sweet).  For an appetizer we got the bachi pickles (which is 6 different veggies that have been pickled). All of those were really good!  For our burgers:  Hubby got the Ronin burger.  I got the No Meat Here \"Burger\",  it was the best veggie burger I have ever had.  Told my family about this that is coming to Vegas today.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my vacations are driven by my love for food. I saw Bachi Burger on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives and instantly knew that I had to get the featured oxtail chili cheese fries and the banh-mi burger as my first meal in Vegas. Unfortunately, they were closed on July 4th when I arrived. Make sure you do your due diligence and check that they're open before you drive out here!

On my second attempt, I came before they were opened and there was already a crowd waiting. That's a great indication of how good the restaurant is. Once seated, we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, the banh-mi burger, and the miyagi-san's burger. The oxtail fries were exactly the way I imagined it would taste. You know when Guy Fieri eats a dish and instantly drops his fork and walks away? I felt like that when I took my first bite. Add in the perfectly fried sunny side egg and you legit feel like you went to fry heaven. Not to mention, the oxtail is tender and they don't skimp on the oxtail either! 

The burgers were just as amazing as the fries. Personally, I didn't have a favorite, but my boyfriend liked the miygai-san burger better as the banh-mi burger is a bit on the sweet side. I regret coming to Bachi Burger on my last day in Vegas as I couldn't experience it another time before leaving. It was one of my favorite spots in Vegas that I made my boyfriend go back there himself and order the oxtail fries and a burger just so he can relive the experience for me LOL. Apparently, the fries taste just as great heated up the next day too.

Come early as reservations aren't allowed!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for lunch recently, had a great experience.  Staff is very very attentive and very nice, I love that.

I don't usually go for the specialty burgers because they all usually have great ingredients that I love but one too many that throws me off.  So I just ordered my own with whatever I wanted on it.  My one complaint, and this happens at a lot of burger joints, is that they over cook the burger.  For instance, medium came out medium well or almost well done.

Appetizer was the fried chicken.  My god that was cooked perfectly and exploded with flavor.  I love their fries as well.

Still though, as a whole this was a great experience.  I know it has just opened, but by the way it was being run, looks like it's been open for years."}
{"text":"Yum. Have tried a few DDD places, but this one was outstanding. Myagi-San and Kalbi Burgers were cooked to perfection (medium rare...would hate to ruin Wagyu beef!) The Parmesan Truffle Fries were nicely seasoned (read salted!) were most places these days seem to think salt is a commodity like gold. Completely happy with this food!"}
{"text":"Had the shogun which is the most expensive burger but it was well worth it. Actually cheaper to have this stuff in a burger than by itself. 

Seared foie gras
Unagi
Waghu beef
Asian pear

It's a rich taste with every bite. See you next month and everytime we come to vegas."}
{"text":"The burgers here do not disappoint! It was about a 30 minute wait to get seated even after the lunch rush. 

I ordered the Kiki's burger, which is perfect for mushroom lovers. They also allow you to add lettuce to it for free. The angus beef was juicy, and paired perfectly with the garlic aioli. This aioli is on the side so you can add as much as you want.

I also tried their oxtail chile cheese fries and their pork belly steamed buns. Both were decent but nothing special.. The burgers here are definitely their best menu items!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on Diners Drive ins & Dives, with Guy Fieri. We were not disappointed!! My husband loved the Ronin burger, I had the Kiki. Both were truly delicious! But my ultimate fave had to be the Oxtail Fries, my mouth still waters when I think about it. We also enjoyed the Truffle Oil Parmesan fries and the Sweet Potato Fries. Portions were generous and staff were great. What more could you ask for? Highly recommend going. 

Gave 4 stars for the wait and small venue."}
{"text":"What a great experience!
The Banh-Mi Burger is incredible tasty, herby and absolutely unexpected, you can taste Asia info@greencornerlv.com every bite!
The Truffle Parmesan Fries are tasty and delicious!!!

Fully recommended!"}
{"text":"Seriously. How do they do it?

I live for Bachi Burger!

Their burgers have interesting ingredient combos and high quality meat. I also tried their hard milkshakes and they are DIVINE. 

This place is amazing. It is a must try for burger fanatics."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had.  I ordered the Shogun burger and was completely blown away.  If you can get by the $26 price tag, this is one killer burger.  Foie gras, eel, pear, miso butter - my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.  My wife had the Kiki's burger and was very happy with her selection (but envious of my burger once she had a bite.)  We also tried the pickle appetizer (meh), the oxtail chili cheese fries and the salt and pepper fries (both very good.)  I had 2 different ciders (who's names I don't remember), and they were both excellent.  While the prices are high, this place is on the same level as Umami Burger - only better.  And I hear they are opening a few soon in LA - a definitely place to check out if you see one."}
{"text":"Went for Father's Day..Food is Great! Burgers are Delicious and Flavorful, the Calamari appetized is Yummy and the presentation is beautiful...But the wait is ridiculously long!! Be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated while there are lots of empty tables all around..They lose a lot of customers who dont want to wait. I only saw 2 or 3 servers."}
{"text":"Truly a great meal!  Went as a party of 4 and we were all very impressed by the meal.  

The pork belly steamed buns were delicious.  The pork was perfect, the buns were light and fluffy.  The dipping sauce on the side added great flavor and was a perfect compliment.

We shared a couple orders of fries and sweet potato fries for the table.  Defiantly a shareable side.  The sweet potato fries were the table favorite.  Great flavor, horseradish dipping sauce was a tasty addition.

The burgers were huge!  They were juicy and delicious.  

The location is easy to find.  Great little place to grab a tasty meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is always a winner for me and my wife. The decor is modern and very welcoming. The service was awesome. Our food came out fast and was all amazing. I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"My family and I loved coming here. After the service we received yesterday, we will NEVER go back. There was 12 of in our party. We were told there was a 20 minutes wait. Of course, when is there never a wait? That was the best experience of the visit. When we were seated, it took awhile for us to get water. We all ordered our meal with our drinks so the server didn't have to come back, nervous she wouldn't. After an hour and 20minutes and no drink refills and a member of our party had to go back to work and left without eating., I asked to speak to the manager to see what the issue was, she sent the server to our table. With that, I questioned the server about the time and why it took so long. The server stated that it was out of her control on why the food was taking so long. I will NEVER go back! I can find better service somewhere else. I will NEVER recommend Bachi Burger again!"}
{"text":"Great service. Also happy to say that the food quality at the different locations is consistent from what I have experienced. The oxtail chill fries are a must have....."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came for my birthday lunch on a Saturday with a party of 11, and we were seated in 40 mins. Quite a long wait, and I wish there was a reservation system, but I guess it makes sense for them not to have one. Also, I wish there was a birthday thing: I briefly glanced at their dessert menu, but didn't see a cake item or anything along those lines. And given that the waiters were being quirky about it being my birthday, it sort of made me feel like birthday people don't go there very often. 

Non-alcoholic beverages: I loved their custom sodas. Apple lychee is the best, the white peach one just tasted sugary (and not very peachy). Strawberry lemonade was also really good, none of that unpleasant tangy taste so common for lemonades. 

Burgers: I loved it and devoured it so fast, but I guess I would agree with the rest of my party. It was super greasy, and I don't know if this is what you would want for a day full of drinking. The grease+alcohol just wasn't a good combination. 

Fries: so good, both the chilli cheese ones and truffle fries. Note: the chili cheese fries is literally a plate of fries, definitely get it for 3-4 people to share (we had two plates for 12 people, along with 3 sides of truffle fries, and that was plenty)"}
{"text":"The food here is DELICIOUS! My husband and I are huge fans of DDD and saw this place featured on the show. While on our trip in Vegas, we had to make a stop here. We came on a Sunday around 3:30 and got a table relatively quick. We waited about 10 minutes. Not too bad compared to what I've read on other Yelp reviews. We ordered the Oxtail Chili fries and shared a Banh Mi Burger. I was in heaven! I loved them both. My favorite part bout the fries were the fried egg. It was like eating potatoes and eggs for breakfast with some delicious oxtail chili! My husband didn't care for the egg, so it worked out perfectly. I got the egg to myself. ;) The Banh Mi burger had wonderful flavor. If you've ever had a Banh Mi and love it, you will enjoy the Banh Mi burger. It marries the flavors of Asian and American perfectly. 

Before leaving Vegas, we went again. This time on a Wednesday at around the same time. Once again, we got in right away but there was only one server working and he was running all over place. There were about 4 other tables that he was waiting on besides us. I don't understand why it's so understaffed. I did notice what looked to be a manager (based on what he was wearing) and two other gals \"working\" in the back. The manager looked like he was keeping himself busy walking around and the girls were putting together silverware packages. This time, we ordered the Oxtail Chili Fries again and the Pork Belly Sliders. Fries were still delicious, but I wasn't too impressed with the sliders. The pork was a little dry in the meaty parts which made it a bit hard to chew and swallow. The flavor was good, but I'd rather have a burger. 

We will definitely be hitting this place up anytime we are in Vegas. There are so many burgers I still want to try! Overall, I gave it a 4 for GREAT food but so so service."}
{"text":"The wait was a bit of a disappointment 30 to 45 min for a burger joint but I have been wanting to try this place forever. It was packed and I felt as though they squeezed you in no matter if you are a couple inches from the next table. 

Overall the burgers were really good I had the Kiki and loved every bite of it my friend had the spicy miso burger looked good but I did not want to try it since I hate egg. My daughter had the kids burger and it was a huge burger we were very surprised! 

Prices were a bit high considering you  have to order your fries separately but I would be back the burger is calling my name!"}
{"text":"Location
Definitely not in the \"glamorous\" part of Las Vegas, but easy to find.  South of The Strip at E. Windmill Lane and S. Bermuda Road, it's about a 10-minute drive from The Strip..

Atmosphere
Not quite Southwestern, not quite Asian, not quite...identifiable.  Yellow walls, dark tables, dark chairs, low lighting.  A bar along the right side of the wall.  Tables and chairs are partially hidden from the front door thanks to the Asian-inspired folding screen behind the hostess stand.  There's patio seating, although it was closed because it was a little cool outside. 

Service
Our waitress was very friendly.  The food was a little...slow.  We ordered burgers and fries and our fries were gone (and we were eating the dipping sauces) while we waited for our burgers.

Food/Drink
Of course, the burgers took a little while because they're so delicious!  No, I didn't order what Guy Fieri had; I don't eat pork.  Instead, I ordered the Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger (chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, crispy onion ring).  It was absolutely amazing!  The right amount of juices dripping from the burger when you bite into it.  The soft warmness of the buns.  The right mixture of toppings on this particular burger.  I made sure to eat mine slow so I could savor it as long as possible!  The French fries are delicious!  We ordered both the Salt and Pepper fries and the Parmesan Truffle fries.   Definitely go for the Parmesan Truffle fries; it's an unique twist on an American favorite!  Dipping sauces were just perfect with them, too. 

Definitely a new favorite in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"great burger joint, an Asian fusion burger joint to be exact. probably the best flavored burgers in Vegas. we ordered the shogun, foie, peaches, truffle oil, really good. the foie was embedded in the patty. the smokey valley, fig jam, brie, arugula, fried onions, truffle aioli, really good too. the food here is good and the friendly service brings me back to Hawaii. oh, i almost forgot, the oxtail fries with the fried egg is to die for! go early, this place does get full fast!"}
{"text":"Mmm. My kaki burger was divine. Excellent quality and flavor. I would definitely return. The onion rings were more like tempura...pineapple ketchup is pretty tasty with."}
{"text":"I wish I would have been feeling better than I was; even given my state of ick, I found Bachi Burger to be quite tasty. We got there around 4:30 on a Saturday evening & there were only a few other tables occupied (by the time we were leaving the movie theater at 7:30, it looked like there were people waiting outside). We were immediately given waters yet never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We could've asked on our own but the water seemed sufficient. The menu is fairly concentrated but the selection is not lacking. Our waiter was the perfect level of attentive, smiled alot & handled my inquiries (i.e. neurosis) like a champ. The menu clearly states \"no substitutions\" (i.e. don't start changing $#!% or it'll take away the integrity of the dish) so I wanted to be respectful of that. We ordered the chili fried chicken (appetizer), truffle parmesan fries w/sundried tomato aioli &, while we could have just split a Kiki burger, at this point, we wanted them cooked differently. I would go back for the chili fried chicken alone. For an appetizer, there's a generous serving. Quality meat cooked perfectly (very filling!). Somehow, I've never had truffle anything so the fries were a treat. I'm not a meat person- I eat meat but I don't want it to taste like meat- so I order everything \"not quite a hockey puck but well done\". What Bachi managed to do is cook it just to the point of thorough where it was still pillow soft inside. There was an intense char on the outside that was deliciously crispy (not hocky puck'y). Since I didn't have much of an appetite & since the chicken & fries filled me up, I didn't eat much of my burger. But what I did eat left the impression of being unique & worth going back for. I'll admit, I was a bit nervous to try Bachi, after reading reviews of both locations & questioning their customer service. Due to the concentrated menu, there's an opportunity to obtain alot of regulars who go back for the same, special item(s) that can't be found elsewhere. But if they can't get the customer service issues under control, something with amazing, long-term potential could be tarnished over something so easy to fix. I just hope my positive experience wasn't luck & that it'll be equally pleasant the next time I go."}
{"text":"This was our first stop as soon as we got to Sin City!  The wait on a Saturday afternoon was about forty minutes.  The first time I came to Bachi, there was no wait on a Saturday night.  

Truffle Fries- loved the truffle!  Next time I'm gonna ask for crispier fries.  Large amount for the price.
Shogun Burger- most expensive burger I'll probably ever have, $26.  It was worth it!  I got my burger medium and it was cooked perfectly.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the wagyu beef pattie vs. a regular pattie.  I love unagi and it was a good compliment to everything else in the burger!  The poached pear added a slight sweetness to all the savory flavors going on.  And foie gras... who doesn't love it?!  
Spicy Miso Burger- I had this on my first visit and it's still my favorite.  I love the spicy sauce with the fried egg. 

All the burgers are creative, delicious, and huuuge!  I always have half a burger left for the following day!"}
{"text":"I had really wanted  to go to this place for such a long time. I think I have been to almost every eatery in this shopping plaza give or take but Bachi Burger was my elusive Triple Crown that kept escaping me....California Chrome I feel your pain. 

For a few years I heard that the burgers here were great and it's true. I have been on a personal search for the best burger in LV and Bachi Burger is a bonafide contender.

This is simply a great burger! I chose the Kikis burger and it was smooth as a Ferrari Modena gliding up the PCH... headed for the Strawberry Festival of course. 805 stand up!  I don't know if any other burger has Bachi  Burger's flavor.  It's definitely not a big burger by any means. I could knock down three of them and be looking for number four!  However, size is not a factor here because quality wins you over. First off, the bun is of a superior quality,  baked fresh and brought in daily from an outside bakery.  It shows. The bun is shiny and moist which helps to make the whole burger pop. I usually need something to wash a burger down, but with the Kikis I could've dry dropped it- I mean I could've... but I didn't. I recommend ordering the burger medium well because it comes out perfect. Just enough pink so flavor is not lost with a well done burger. They give you a tasty Aioli sauce on the side but you won't even need it. The burger speaks for itself. The burger is presented very well also. Ordered the garlic fries and was not disappointed. Excellent! They come sprinkled with a good portion of jalapeños on top and are very tasty and they are enough to share.

Service was good. The rap on Bachi Burger has been the long wait times to get your food, however I didn't find that to be the case in our experience and this is serving four adults and two small kids. The kid's grilled cheese looked awesome by the way, garnished with an apple slice with a few carrots. Parking is not an issue here either- you could park a tractor trailer in this lot if you needed to. I hope you don't need to. For this quality of burger the price was not bad. The Kiki's comes in at about 12 bucks. For desert, go next door to Rocket Fizz and go hog wild reliving your childhood with some retro candies and sodas. So the bottom line is that my search for the best burger in Vegas has yielded a top ranked contender here...who else can step in the ring with Bachi Burger?"}
{"text":"Porkbelly Buns: 10/10 [get this]
Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries: 10/10 [get this]
Kiki's Burger: 8/10
Bone Marrow OxTail Jam: 6/10 

The food was awesome except the Bone Marrow Jam, I felt like it was too sweet. 2 people in our party ordered kale salads which came drenched in way too much dressing, missing avocado, pecans and cranberries. The salads were also not properly portioned with one having 1.5x more greens than the other. It was noticeably more. The waitress explained they have a new hire and it was his first time making salad. They just gave the missing ingredients on separate plates so the people who got salads could mix it in themselves. I have no clue how you can completely fuck up a salad. Makes me wonder... Is he smart enough to know he needs to wash his hands before salad prep? Is he high? Was there training? Can he see that there was way too much dressing? Is he blind? If he knew he put too much dressing, why not start over? Does he care? I mean whats going on?????"}
{"text":"Interesting and unique take on the gourmet burger craze. Incredibly well executed and insanely delicious. Ive had the Spicy Miso burger and the Kiki's burger. I the Spicy Miso is hands down the best burger Ive had in Las Vegas since I started coming here for work every other week since April '13. Ive had at least one burger on each trip at a new place and Ive come back to only 2 places so far and this is one of them (The other is Hubert Keller's Burger Bar for his namesake burger, also incredible). If you can get yourself off the strip, the burger is worth it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the service leaves something to be desired. Very rushed and both times way understaffed. Not unfriendly, but just not at the level it should be for a sit down burger joint of this caliber."}
{"text":"My friend Kevin told me about Bachi Burger when he was last here.  He said it was worth the drive of going all the way to the Southeast part of town.  Got here on a weekday lunch after 1pm and the place was still pretty packed.  I guess these must be the employees of the local companies.  Decor-wise, the place is very minimalist, a few paintings of Japanese theme to set the mood with white walls and standard track lighting.  

I got the Ronin burger, parmesan fries, and the iced matcha green tea.  From least favorite, the matcha green tea was not sweetened and I didn't really get a strong matcha taste when drinking it.  It just tasted different as the tea I got from formal Japanese restaurants.  As for the Ronin burger, it was polished off...quickly!  The slaw, egg, and the burger really mixed well.  The only thing I wished for was maybe for a crispier bun.  The bun was a fresh, soft, warm bun but if I do come back here, I may ask them to toast my bun if possible.  The parmesan fries were also great!  I didn't even need the ketchup looking sauce that came with.  I did try it and the sauce really didn't help to enhance the flavors of the fries. 

Except for a few things that I nitpick about, I'm ready to sign up to Bachi Burger's fan club.  They have a large beer list but all of them are bottles including Hitachino which has been a favorite of mine lately.  Lastly, the prices are a bit on the pricy side but the quality and the uniqueness of their product is worth it in my opinion.

Memo to Bachi Burger owners:  any chance of coming out to the SF Bay Area to open a branch?"}
{"text":"Great, unique eats.  I had the \"crusty crab\" burger and my friend had the peking duck buns.  The truffle fries were amazing.  I do have to admit the service was a little...iffy.  Our food took  45mins to come out (not that busy in the place) and then they only brought out my burger; not my friend's food or even the fries to hold her over!  The manager did come over and explain there was a mix up in the kitchen and he ended up not charging for the duck buns since they took another 15minutes after that...Definitely necessary after the wait.  The server did keep our drinks full, but the whole demeanor of the restaurant  crew screams \"new staff\".  Dessert is a must!  We tried the \"pop tart\" and the Vietnamese doughnuts (SO GOOD!). The food kept this review in the 4 star range."}
{"text":"I had heard so many rave reviews about Bachi Burger, that on my most recent visit to Las Vegas, it was the only place I wanted to go to. Having lived here, and having family here as well, I've been to most everywhere else anyway. 

So, as it's my birthday month, yes, as we get older, we celebrate the month, as opposed to the day because we don't know how many more we'll have - I ended up at Bachi Burger up at Peccole Ranch. Went for lunch on a weekday to avoid the evening and weekend crowds. 

Nice restaurant and pretty good service. The server, even while in training, I believe her name is Brittany, was very attentive, friendly and nice. She kept her composure as it started getting busy as I opted to get in right after opening to avoid the lunch crowd. 

I ordered the Iced Green Tea Matcha. Enjoyed it! Especially the unlimited refills. 

I also ordered the Kiki Burger. Enjoyed it. Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki &
Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Aged Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli. 

I also had an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. It wasn't quite what I was expecting and I ended up leaving about half of the order untouched. Not that it was bad though. 

All in all, I enjoyed my meal and I'd go back if I have a burger craving and I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience that I've had at Bachi Burger, and Alex, the so-called \"manager,\" displayed very poor customer service. He did not want to listen to or address my concern. He kept cutting me off to over-explain their shortcomings.

I ordered the Kalbi Burger, which is my favorite, therefore this is not the first nor second nor third time eating this meal. I specified my temperature as Medium-Well. My burger came out very pink in the middle and I sent it back. They took my eaten burger and put it in the oven, as I was told-Um Yuck. This doesn't sound like good practice to me. I would expect a new patty, grilled to my order specification. Even with the oven baked, eaten patty on this second try, it was still pink in the middle. By this time, I have taken two bites of raw beef, have been waiting almost an hour for dinner as I ordered it, and am pretty frustrated. I again returned the plate this time requesting for a new burger to be made and for it to be removed from my bill. The waitress states that I will still be charged for the meal. Huh?! Really??!! I've been waiting to eat my dinner, you guys can't get it right and I am still required to pay for it. Worst customer-service ever!! Alex needs retraining and Bachi Burger needs to reevaluate their customer service standards. So beware, the only thing I was fed at Bachi Burger tonight was raw meat and a bunch of BS!!"}
{"text":"Well, its not what it used to be. Bachi used to be our absolute favorite spot for good burgers and fries! We decided to make a trip in tonight with the kiddos and left completely disappointed by the service and quality. First, my burger came out missing the onion rings and the avacado was on the side. The server said he would bring the onion rings out which I found odd as that meant I was then going to have to build the burger for them. Okay, no big deal. Then we get our salt and pepper garlic fries. We began eating them to find a small hair. I pulled it out and we kept on eating. It happens and understand you cant completely avoid these accidents and have never had an issue before. We then ran into another hair so we decided to say something. The manager came over, apologized and offered another order which we agreed. We finished off dinner to receive our check ...... it included the fries. The $4.00 hairy fries. Seriously?! I don't like to speak up in restaurants as it makes me uncomfortable but this situation warranted it. But you are seriously going to turn around and charge me the measly $4.00?! Now THAT is just gross. We wont be back. Don't think the charge was worth losing business forever."}
{"text":"This place is off the strip but was strongly recommend by my friend.  I ordered the Truffle parmesan fries, Miyagi san burger, spicy miso, and the Mr. Ho burger. All the burgers were great and super tasty.  The buns were fresh and my miyagi san burger came with taro buns. I wished I had more stomach room so I could eat more of their food. A must stop if you ever go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers I've ever had.  Between the 5 of us, we practically ordered half their menu, and every last bite was amazing.  Their edamame sauteed in garlic butter and truffle oil is so flavorful and mouth-watering.  Favorite entrees were the Ronin and Spicy Miso burgers and the Peking Duck Steamed Bun.  

Wish we could have tried their Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato, but they were out -- we'll be back though: this place is worth the drive away from the main Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!! We didn't eat before the Carrot Top show and were looking for a place that served dinner late and we found the perfect spot!!!

I can't say enough good things about this place, we arrived around 10:30 and it was still full but we were able to be seated pretty quickly.

The fries are served a la Carte and they are big enough to share with another person. If you have more people, I would suggest trying all three types they serve.

They also have tons of burgers from beef to lamb to vegetarian and fish! 

My boyfriend had the Black and Green with Wagyu, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, blue cheese and garlic and he couldn't stop raving about it and actually said \"perfect burger, so good!\"

And I had the Bachi fish sandwich and it was delicious!!! It was pan seared to a nice crispy finish which was just delectable and the flavor combination is seriously amazing!  

Oh and they have adult milkshakes!!! What??? 

I would most definitely go back again just to get the truffle Parmesan fries!!!"}
{"text":"Just got home from Bachi Burger. Never go back again!! Burger overcooked, egg overcooked, truffle aioli fries tasted like fries with brown gravy. Told the waitress, she apologized but didn't even offer to take a nickle off of the bill! My wife and I have been coming here for 6 years but the last 3 times the food was not up to par. 3 strikes, you're out!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers with Asian twist, $10-13 a burger. I got the Miyagi san cause the onion rings appealed to me. 

Minus stars for the bad service....most of the people looked like they hate life. The boba I ordered at beginning of meal came after I paid..and it was super sweet and gave me a stomach ache. UGH. so disappointing..

Also, we came around 3:30pm, and there were maybe two other people waiting in \"line\".  There were tons of open tables but they still made us wait for 15 minutes while they......no idea?"}
{"text":"I've been to the other locations and they were all fine. My experience at this location however was pretty bad. If you want to keep customers coming to this location I suggest you fire the waiter and waitress working on this day. The service was so bad. Even though there were only 3 other tables besides us, we did not get checked on once. Never coming back to this location due to your employees. Food was fine just really bad service."}
{"text":"I have been to Bachi several times, by myself, with family, with friends and each and every time consistently this place produces! The BEST burger ever! Whatever you choose from protein style, to turkey, to wish they had buffalo but that is another story. They prepare for you! The staff keeps you happy and the drinks full! Love love love their green tea! No matter where you sit from the bar, to any seat in the house you are made to feel comfortable and never rushed despite the waiting line to get in!"}
{"text":"We got here around 7:50p and was seated in 25 min.   Our server,  Kevin was very friendly. We ordered:
1.  Oxtail chili fries - kiddos loved it. This is a must try item. 
2.  Chili garlic wings -  the wings are crunchy, however the girl told us that they ran out of sauce; not impressed at all.   They should have let the customers know ahead of time if they are ran out of certain item not until you brought it out.   What can we do at that time?   Anyhow,  Kevin was nice enough to offered us different dipping sauce. 
3.  Kiki burger -  the meat was tender,  a good choice to try out. 
4.  Spicy Miso burger -  meat was good and savory but not spicy at all.
5. Kalbi burger -  my daughter loved it but too kimchi on it which making the buns to soggy. 
6. Miso -  too salty; nothing special with it. 
Overall,  if we're coming back to Vegas, we will definitely give it a try again."}
{"text":"When you come in you intend to get the whole burger exactly as they have it in the menu with all the ingredients. This was not the case this time around.  The Bahn Mi patty was not in stock at all today.  They recommended a plain beef patty.  I honestly thought they had a better thought process than this.  I'm sorry, but don't even think of selling this perfect burger without all of the ingredients.  With this being the case today, I couldn't believe they wouldn't even offer some kind of discount for a burger that wasn't complete.  The Bahn Mi burger is suppose to have shrimp in the patty.  This was left out and I was given a plain patty.  I left there without giving a tip for the first time ever.  

I gave the stars I did today because the truffle fries and the pork buns were spot on as always.  I removed stars because of the lapse in judgement in recommending an incomplete product and not thinking of giving a discount of any kind."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing, server was nice. 
I had the Miyagi-San burger and it was simply phenomenal. Truffle fries didn't disappoint either."}
{"text":"Not your typical burger joint.  The burgers are UNIQUE and taste AMAZING!  Little pricey but worth every penny.  The service was great - Jacob was a breath of fresh air. Offered some great suggestions since it was our first time eating there and we had no idea where to begin. He did not steer us wrong!  We had a wonderful experience and will be coming back soon - thanks Jacob your patience and outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Truffle fries were really good, service was good but the transitions took longer. The guy who sat us didn't give us any menus to read off of while we waited for our server. I understood that we'd have to wait since she was the only one serving and the other was on break, but the guy could've at least given us some menus."}
{"text":"Went to Bachi for the second time today and will now be a regular. After hearing so many good things about the place, I was a bit disappointed after my first visit. Food was good, but nothing wowed. Today we ordered the Kiki and Fish Burgers. Both were equally delicious!  I was disappointed the Veggie burger wasn't yet available at 5pm as I had been looking forward to that all day, but now I have an excuse to go back.  I've had both the truffle and salt/pep fries. Decent, but will save those calories for possibly a second burger next time ;)"}
{"text":"after spending a few weeks abroad, i was dying for a burger.  and this place really hit the spot.  their choices look amazing and i ended up going for the kiki burger, which was both delicious and filling.  

our waiter was new or something so he was acting all noob, but it's all good.  we also got the duck buns, which i thought would totally give me a boner, but it was kind of dry and not very flavorful.  it was definitely disappointing, but i took the remaining two and brought it home to feed the drunkards at the hotel.  

so if i come back, which i definitely will given the opportunity, i'm sticking to the burgers!"}
{"text":"15 of us. Couldn't have run smoother this time. Thank you. Last time, not so great. Food always excellent."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Henderson location so I figured this Bachi would be practically the same. The food was great as usual, however, the service here is terrible. We were seated fairly quick but nobody brought us waters for about 10 minutes. Then my fork was dirty so I asked for another one and the second fork was dirty as well! Our server seemed frazzled and all over the place almost as if it were his first day. If the food wasn't so damn good I wouldn't come back here. If you want great service go to the Henderson location!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burgers I have ever eaten. My friends and I go to Vegas several times a year and we always go to Bachi Burger several times each trip. You have to try the Kalbi burger and the truffle fries. The sodas are great too. Don't hesitate to try something new because EVERYTHING is so good there."}
{"text":"Horrible! The burgers are extremely small and not even very tasty I will never go here again! Ok service but the food was nothing special. Also over priced for the tiny portions they give you."}
{"text":"Tried Bauchi Burger for the first time tonight. We had 2 different burgers, fish sandwich, oxtail cheese fries, sweet potato fries and pepper fries. All were delicious. Definitely lived up to the solid 4 Star reviews."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger joint in Vegas!

It has an original style; a burger play with an artsy japanese vibe to it. There is great photography hanging on the walls and its fairly small and intimate. The server was very friendly and was very patient with us since it was our first time there. 

I ordered a burger with a fried egg on it since I had never had one before, it was so amazing I am afraid to order it from anywhere else because I don't want to be disappointed. The fries are all so good! Our group ordered one of each so we got to try all of them. I'm glad we gave this place a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here. I live in Los Angeles so every time we go and visit Las Vegas we have to come eat here!"}
{"text":"Just picked up my to go order. Great food! HORRIBLE SERVICE. I waited 10 minutes just for someone to notice I was waiting although all three servers passed me and it was obviously not busy. Because of that I decided not tip. When I signed the slip with no tip the cashier became rude and brushed me off with a halfway goodbye. 
Why should I have tipped you when you obviously ignored me and then acted like I was bothering you from your duties. C'mon have some common sense. The hiring manager needs to reconsider who they accept as employees because judging from other reviews I am not the only complaint. Other than that GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Dining room appeared half full. Service was ok, nothing stellar. Weren't asked drink order until food order was taken. 
Had the oxtail chili cheese fries. This easily could be a meal for two people or 3. Size is meant to be shared. Delicious.
Also had pork belly bao buns. Nice. Would have liked a little crispness to the meat, but still inhaled it all, because it's pork belly.
Friend had lunch special: selection of app, entree, & dessert of the day. She had roasted Brussel sprouts, fish burger, and donuts."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since they opened and this place is awesome....one of the biggest reasons is for its unique menu.  I don't eat franchise food and I don't really go to Strip restaurants so this is actually a perfect alternative.  The sausages are one of my favorites - (with the mustard sauce).  Also looooove the chicken.  The last time I went I ordered their salad (mandarin oranges and cucumbers in it...not sure what it was called).  But yeah, the only issue is location - they are too far from where I live! 
And I have to respond to Jack because I am feeling so ashamed that someone would complain about having to get up and go to a cashier to pay (that is near the exit)?!  Are you serious???"}
{"text":"bachi burger didnt live up to the high expectations for me or the other three in our group. first of all they can charge the prices they do if its justified with the full spectrum experience and it was not. we had our appetizer plates dropped off and 3 out of the four had to be changed out because they were dirty. we ordered the much applauded oxtail fries and they were nothing special. the oxtail was very sparse and it could have just been beef for all we knew. we also got the truffle fries....very unsatisfied. if you use the word truffle which is a very expensive, flavorful ingredient it better be apparent in the dish or it just becomes a catch phrase and it just wasn't there. calamari was very good and the dipping sauces it comes with were the highlight of the lunch for us all. the jalepeno, cilantro sauce was wonderful, i would have it at home always if i could find it on the market. ok...its called a burger place right. very good beef, fresh light buns and overall good. but you could get this meal (minus the sauces) for %50 less at five guys or fatburger. we paid $111 for four burgers, three app's (2 of which were fries) and three soda's. no desert.  they just cant justify that price to me with the short comings they have."}
{"text":"First came here about 6 months ago, not sure why I haven't written a review. Love this place.

I've tried just about every one of their burgers and they are heavenly. I love pairing them with a bowl of Ramen which again is pretty great. Typically what I do is share the ramen and the burger with someone else and end up pretty full. If you add the ox tail fries you're going to be stuffed.

When it gets busy the wait time gets up there. They have opened up another section of the restaurant which seems to be helping with that.

Dan is the server to have. We all thought he was the owner he knew everything so well. Each of my friends got what they wanted based on his guidance. Fantastic.

Food comes out quick, but good gracious. Last time I went I even tried the chicken sandwich and it is pretty fabulous as well."}
{"text":"You gotta eat here before you die! I wish I had two stomach to try few more items - I am stuffed; eat a whole bowl of spicy miso Raman and a giant spicy miso burger!!!! Ramen is the best I ever had - just damn perfect. If I lived here, I would come lot more."}
{"text":"Kiki Burger and Sweet Potato Fries. Best I ever had."}
{"text":"There's a burger fever going around Vegas but this is one spot that beats most of them. Bachi burger doesn't have the best vegetarian burger but overall their selection of creative burgers are amazing. If you don't eat meat like myself, i would try the fish burger and the crab cake burger.  The fish burger is mouth watering with naturally buttery cod and the crab cake is full of flavor and leaves you full. All the fries are amazing with the not so normal ponzu cream sauce that gives a kick in ur mouth. I love the sweet potato fries. The only downside of this place is their dessert menu... not a big fan, i think it needs major improvement. nothing cool to mention here. But overall with the burgers are good enough to make you want to come back!"}
{"text":"I don't know- just wasn't feeling it.. I was so excited about my Banh Mi burger (especially after all the rave reviews), but I found the burger to be so overloaded with toppings and sauce that the actual burger meat suffered. It just wasn't as juicy as a good burger should be, and the sauce itself was a bit too salty. Someone else in my group ordered a medium burger that came out still mooing.. When he asked them to cook the meat they were beyond gracious about it, but the \"medium\" burger came out rare again- hilarious- Ecoli be damned..There's so much potential, but Bachi burger just didn't work for me..."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, but for good reason... very tasty japanese fusion! We love trying their latest picked assortment! Sometimes it's just too much of a hassle to wait for the food, but the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great burger, kind of small, but that is me im kind of a pig. Staff was freindly but they are horribly managed. I believe they forget they are at work and are to layed back and unprofessional around the restaurant. The building is layed out backwords the 2 entrances are rediculous. this is just negative feedback that could help this gold mine. a little pricy for my taste, But my KIKI BURGER WAS FANTASTIC. And the front of the restaurant faces windmill ave. and they are storing broken equipment from the kitchen in plain view of guests really? they need to get this together. The triple D show is gonna have people flock here so get it together."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I got the Kiki Burger with plain fries and pineapple ketchup. I would have given it 5 stars, but they seemed understaffed. I never got a refill on my drink and I had to ask twice for a \"to go\" box. I'll be back, but maybe on a less busy night."}
{"text":"I LOVE burgers, but after having bachi, it'll change your perspective and have you saying, \"I LOVE BACHI!\" 

Trust me, it's like that."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but they are horribly staffed. The wait time in this place is ridiculous compared to the actual available seating. We had to send someone over th inform the staff that we were waiting to be seated. Keep in mind there were three other groups of people that entered while there was a couple that was there before I arrived with my guest. Horrible service and will probably never come back"}
{"text":"Food here is great. Service bad.
So 4 stars for food and 1 star for service - average 2 stars.

Usually extremely crowded after 6, long lines, we went early, around 4 pm.
Even though there were plenty of empty tables, no one was in a rush to greet customers and seat them. Waitresses were standing around by the bar, chatting, one of them on the cell phone. Finally sat down, took a long time for someone to come over and offer to take an order. Service unfriendly, after food came, no one stopped by to ask if everything was good. Waitresses did not smile or acted like they wanted to be there. Not sure if they are underpaid or just happened to not like their jobs.

Because food is always good, will return, will try their other location.
Just thought the owner should know how customers are treated.
When I am paying over 12 dollars for a burger that is not even grass-fed, I hoped for better customer service."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the airport and stumbled on to this terrific place. That would be thanks to Yelp! They have a very eclectic Meier to say the least. A combo of gourmet hamburgers, fries, soups/salads and about 8-10 Asian dishes. 
I had the Kiki burger and it was a 10! The salt and pepper fries with a garlic, mayo and red peppers sauce laced with jalapeños  was totally great! I observed other folks meals and I hardly saw a morsel left on a plate.
Do yourself a favor and try this quaint place and eat to your heart's content!"}
{"text":"Very good Asian-fusion burger place!  Very trendy and very good service!  I tried the Banh Mi Burger, Ronin and others, and I was not disappointed.  All of their meat patties are deliciously juicy, always grilled, and always soooo tasty.  Their ox-tail chili cheese fries are awesome.  No wonder they appeared on Food Network's \"Diners, Drives and Dives\"!"}
{"text":"Japanese take on Burgers.

Small industrial space in a generic strip mall next to a subway, this place has a very simple design inside. 

Ox tail chili cheese fries were soo good and savory.  It was probably the best chili cheese fries I've ever had.

I do not eat beef hamburgers, so I had the fish burger, and it was pretty good. The bread was the right sweetness, and everything in the burger complemented well. Also, it was so pretty presentation wise when I got it as well. I  also love how IMPRESSIVELY thin the onion slices were-- it complected the dish perfectly and didn't overpower the burger with the big onion taste.

Great selection of microbrews, and sake.


My friend got the shogun burger (which has wagu beef and foie gras), and he said it was okay. He said the flavor overload was a bit much, and the quality of the foie gras wasn't that good. However, to each to his own. Hey, I don't even eat burgers myself."}
{"text":"The food is good. Had the Ronin burger. The ox tail fries are also delicious. The service here could be better. We took a taxi here. We asked the waitress if they could call us a cab. Waited over forty minutes. We asked if the cab had been called. They tell us they called the cab but someone had sent the cab away."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I've loved them since they opened but it's about time I actually give them the stars they deserve.  Recently, my friends and I went and I ordered the Kiki's Burger and the Parm/Truffle fries.  Very yum...I'm salivating right now.   My friends ordered the Ronin Burger and No Meat Burger, along with the roasted peppers; they loved their meals and it all came out perfect.  We didn't leave a crumb and felt fat and happy.  One of my friends is a regular, like me, and the other friend has become a new fan.  Although we didn't order them this time, I love their boba drinks and will sometimes will order just the drink when I'm on the go.  The brothers Watada did an amazing and creative job.  Their staff has always been polite, friendly and the food has been served in reasonable time.  It's a must-try in Vegas if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Pork Belly steamed buns ... Yummy !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something new for date night and I've known about Bachi Burger for years through Yelp as \"one of the best burgers in Las Vegas\" as well as all of my friends constantly obsessing over it. We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet, but still so addicting. 

We then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite, I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh. There wasn't much oxtail that I could taste and the warmth issue was very off putting. Lastly, we settled for the Miyagi San burger and Ronin burger. I LOVE fusion food, but I was not impressed by the flavors of the Ronin. Something was just missing to make it amazing. I did appreciate the crunch of the coleslaw and the caramelized onions, but all the other flavors cancelled out the taste of the fried egg. My husband's Miyagi burger was much better, but we asked for it medium and it was WELL done. There was no pink or anything, but the taste of the fried egg was amazing and the onion strips were crispy and fried to perfection. Overall, I would say that Holsteins has better burgers for this price range, and to not believe the DDD and Yelp hype. Come try it for yourself, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not happy about this, but I had to bump one star off of their rating due to our second visit here.

Overall I loved the concept of the banh mi burger (plus I'm Vietnamese), but in regards to execution and flavor, it failed for me. The burger wasn't moist like the Kiki's burger. I soon realized that it's not moist or juicy because it's a ground pork and beef mixture for the patty. The ground pork definitely caused the patty to dry out. The patty also was extremely bland, it could of definitely used more time marinating. Lastly, the nuoc cham (fish sauce) dipping sauce for the burger was watery and didn't do the burger any justice. 

Also, we ordered a side of grilled shishito peppers. The sweet soy seasoning was delicious and enhanced the shishito peppers natural sweetness. We enjoyed the entire bowl until the very end. Out of nowhere, the very last 2 peppers were aggressively spicy! It took us by such shock since we didn't know that shishito peppers could be that spicy. We popped the entire huge pepper in our mouth and we were both soon very irritated and uncomfortable by the spice level of the pepper. Mind you, we are spice eaters and avid fans of spicy food. But this was like a very bad prank. We were not expecting something to burn so bad, it was so intense! Plus we chomped the entire pepper not knowing any better. It ruined my taste buds and my throat was swollen for a good 30 minutes. Yep, it was an episode of punk'd. Be careful you non spice eaters! That one is a doozy!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! their food is great. My favorite is the oxtail chilli cheese fries & their strawberry guava shake! Their salads are good too. Delicious! The restaurant is nice and clean. The service could get a little slow sometimes, but other than that I enjoy this place very much."}
{"text":"5 Stars because for someone who rarely craves burgers, this place makes me want to crave them regularly. Glad they're opening one in L.A. 

Since going gluten/dairy free, burgers without a bun has been - eh, okay. 

However, my friend gave me the impression that this is one of the best go-to places in Vegas. I was hesitant at first because I was hoping for some good Thai, but my friend's enthusiasm got me suspicious -- could a burger place be that good that it warrants a visit by him and his family each time they're in Vegas??? So I acquiesced...

I ordered the Miyagi-san without a bun (and I gave away my onion rings since they were battered) -- and boy, it was so yummo-licious I wanted to lick the plate. I ate every morsel, and since I didn't eat a bun, my stomach had room for garlic fries & their perfectly-lightly-sweetened plantation tea.

My two complaints are:

1. They did not list their operating hours...we had to wait for them to open at 11am...seriously, this place needs to be 24/7!

2. Almost ruined my mood when the waitress told me the chef could not make my Shogun special with fois-grae without butter. =(

Anyhoo, place that can make a bun-less burger taste the way it does has my vote, and a perfect blend of burger-Asian fusion to boot! Can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu!

{"text":"I was in Vegas for a business trip and my friend took us to this place.  I had the Miyagi burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  Perfectly done and with a fried egg!  I also recommend the oxtail fries, it was crazy good.  Only down fall for me is that we couldn't drink cause we had to go back to work.  I want to go back one day and relax with a drink, I think this place would be a very cool hangout also.  I highly recommend this place.  I can't wait to go back and take my wife one day!"}
{"text":"We tried the banh mi and Kiki burger. Both were great as well as the salt and pepper garlic fries. Kids meals were fresh and fast as well. We would come back again to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible staff especially a Filipino boy named Rick!  The worst, I'll never be back he threatened my life and Chef Chris never responded.  So everyone I come into contact with I let them know to stay far away from here!!"}
{"text":"Still good in my book but I realized that some of the burgers are a bit off (so down to 4 stars).

We had the Mr. Miyagi (needed some sort of sauce)

Banh Mi is still my favorite."}
{"text":"Food was okay and the burgers we ordered wasnt cooked at the right temperature.  We all asked for it to be cooked medium and it came out almost well withe the edges burnt. Service was slow and it wasnt busy at all."}
{"text":"Great service gal, great music- we love hawaiian vibes so so much, Aloha is our favorite flavour.
We came here for Caesar salad, they are out of chicken for this salad, they are out of tan tan ramen, they are out of tan Katsu shio, they were out of a entire list of things we were not interested in. 
I'm way bummed, aside from Monta this is our very favorite restaurant. It's grandparents day at my 12 year old school, I took her out early to bring her to her favorite requested restaurant Bachi with my two teens and my mom. 
Just got news they are closing right now. They just opened at 11 and they are closing their doors right now. 
My heart hurts for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE, big big bummer! 
We are hangry! We ordered at 11:20 and it's 11:55 still no good seen. 
This waitress is magical!"}
{"text":"Burger with a twist? It's here!
A great beef patty with unique toppings of flavor!

Went with my family - seated right away.. host came by and explained items on the menu. This was our 2nd time and we enjoyed the first. 

Husband went with host recommendation of the Kiki burger - lots of toppings including carmelized bacon and gruyere cheese... nuf said. 
I tried the Kalbi burger. kim chee was great, however they were a little heavy handed on the kalbi marinade which truly overpowered the other tastes. It did have a side of bachi pickles which were delicious. 

Truffle fries are an explosion of flavor in your mouth... crisp potato fry with parmesan cheese and truffle cream... they're addicitng. 
Don't pass on their sweet potato fries, dusted in just the right amount of sea salt. All fries are served with creative sauces.. however you can eat them plain and be happy.
 
Wanted to enjoy the food, so we stuck with water. A little pricey for a burger, but then again, you're not going to find another one like it in the valley."}
{"text":"After seeing this place featured in Food Network's Triple D, it's been something I've always wanted to try in Vegas. There's never enough time when visiting Sin City but we made sure this time Bachi Burger was on our itinerary. Hopping on over here after a show off the strip, their closing time at 1am was perfectly convenient. 

OXTAIL CHILI FRIES ($11.50) is a must-order. Most poutine fries I've had other than in Montreal tend to get soggy from all the gravy, but not here. I also love that it's not thick-cut resulting to a most-welcomed crunch on each bite. With beans and shreds of oxtail meat in the chili sauce, topped with garlic aioli, plus cheese and jalapenos, each component delivered its purpose. Let's not forget the cilantro which is my favorite part as it added a clean and distinct finish to the flavor profile. This was the bomb.com!  

RONIN WAGYU BURGER ($16) normally comes with Angus beef patty but you can request for Wagyu meat for extra $$. I suggest you go this route because I tell you, it makes a huuuuuge difference. One bite and the unmistakable taste I got instantly was from the high grade beef. It had a nice smoky char-grilled flavor that was oozing with all its juicy splendor! WOW! The caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, and katsu bbq all fused well together into this phenomenal finished product. I really love everything about this burger including the bun! Not sure if you need the yuzu citrus aioli on the side because it's already flavorful as it is. 

KIKIS BURGER ($12) is Angus beef patty with sauteed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. After having the wagyu beef patty with my Ronin burger, it was hard not to spot the difference between the two. The former was definitely more delicious however, let's not forget this burger had bacon and everyone knows anything with bacon is good. When in doubt, stick with the Ronin. 

CHILI FRIED CHICKEN ($7) was good but just not the flavor I was looking for. I was hoping it was more like a Korean chili chicken with a sweet glaze, instead, this was more tangy and on the citrusy side. Packed most of it home and ate it the next day. Surprisingly, it tasted better.

Our server was on top of things and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I mean who doesn't like talking to people who knows what they're talking about? The rest of the staff was friendly and in a genuine way. Can't complain! 

So happy Bachi Burger has now opened its doors in LA. Soon OC, I hope!"}
{"text":"Not much more can be said about the amazing food you will experience at Bachi Burger when a restaurant has over 800 reviews already.  However I will chime in anyway with my own opinion.  This is definitely must try burger spot in Las Vegas.  Since its spotlight by Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives Bachi Burger has gained a national following.  I cannot wait to go back myself.  

I had the MIYAGI-SAN on this visit and I surely was not disappointed.  From the sweet fresh baked bun to the perfectly cooked medium patty this burger was delicious.  I did not even ask for ketchup and mustard because that would just make it another burger.  I could go on and on about how good it was but I just recommend go and try one asap.  

We also had the Organic Edamame with Garlic and Truffle oil and one again I needed no sauce to did the beans were just fantastic the way the chef prepared them.  The Truffle fries were also very tasty and the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli was a fine substitute for ketchup any day.   

The No MEAT Burger was very flavorful.  The red bean mixed with other ingredients gave the patty a sweetness that was very tasty.  Finished with a slice of tofu over the top accompanied with mixed greens, red onion and tomato this burger looked like a masterpiece.  Overall we were very satisfied with our meal and we are eager to come back and explore the menu.

The service was friendly and attentive.  I did find it funny that when I called and inquired what they had for vegetarians, the response was \" We have a chicken burger and a fish burger\"??  Then when we visited the restaurant we asked to see the menu prior to seating and asked the same question, a different person responded with \"we have a fish burger and a chicken burger\"??  I was laughing on the inside and maybe a little on the outside thinking that vegetarians eat chicken and fish.  Oh well nothing that a good informative book and a little more training could not fix.  I chose not to dock Bachi Burger a star on the staffs absurd answers to my questions."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with our breakfast it was very average and a variety of breakfast menu is very small.The service was very average and the waitress didn't know the menu that well. We were the only table at the restaurant and we asked for water and she forgot. I ordered the eggs Benedict which I didn't like my dad ordered the omelette he said it was ok."}
{"text":"Ever since Triple D came to this restaurant, I had been dying to go. Now that I have gone...IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!

-Oxtail chili cheese fries are excellent. The flavor is outrageous with all the different asian infused spices they use.
-The ronin burger was great. It was juicy and worth the money.

Would I go back...HELL YEAH!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners Drive ins and Dives. Thought we would check it out. The oxtail chili fries were amazing. The burgers were the best ever. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the experience and mostly service. The lady that served us really didn't care about our experience at all. Just bad service from the start. Took our order and we ordered appetizer and that was sent out with the entree, ate appetizer and the fries was still not out. Waited while she clean something at the bar then came by  had to tell her we still didn't get the fries clearly forgot to make it and by the time it came out my burger was cold. They didn't even care. The food was mediocre at best over priced for the quality and service. Would be nice if the manager would contact me to give me an explanation."}
{"text":"Burger to come back for again...and again...and again.

This is my second time here this week this place is that good. First time I went with the Crusty Crab w mango chutney. Stone blue crab with a Stone arrogant bast ale hit the spot. The flavor combination is what every restaurant pays good consulting money to achieve. 2nd time around I ordered the miyagisan wagyu burger and every bite had a smoky bacon smooth silky chili mayo flavor. Must try. Service always friendly helping me out with extra napkins for these \"worth-the-mess\" gems of a meal. Family fiendly too."}
{"text":"When we found out this place opened up right by our Office an immediate craving for Burgers set in.  We drove over and ordered three different burgers all at different temperatures.  A Black & Green (mushroom, bacon, spinach, blue cheese) a Miyagi San (chili mayo, fried egg, bacon, onion rings) and a Ronin (onions, cole slaw, fried egg, yuzu dressing).All the burgers were cooked perfectly.  This is a great spot for lunch and will be back again."}
{"text":"The Hype is real! Hate the wait but when you want something unique when visiting vegas a little wait makes your trip a lot better. Recommend OX Tail Fries, onion rings, and any of their burgers"}
{"text":"The Black and Green Burger was probably one of the best burgers that I have ever had (and I have had a lot of burgers).  This is a must visit place when in Vegas.  Make sure to get there early to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out due to the great reviews on yelp and we were not disappointed. 

Party of 3 order:

Appetizer 
Calamari - only thing special  about this dish was the sauce and hint of sesame oil...won't order again
Truffle parmesan fries - not bad but will use the precious space in my tummy for maybe the oxtail fries next time 

Entrée 
 Pork belly Steamed bun - tastes like Filipino  siopao!
Spicy Miso burger - not spicy at all but very good nonetheless. We were worried about how well the apple vingerette would taste in the burger but it was very subtle.
Kids burger - my 9 year old son devoured it and said it tasted 'fresh'. Be careful with add ons...my son wanted cheese which tacked on $1.50 to his $10 meal

Dessert
Portuguese donuts w/coffee  Gelato - nothing special about this dish. Was basically a donut hole smothered in cinnamon.
Chocolate peanut butter souffle - came with vanilla ice cream and some blueberry sauce. It was much better than the donuts but would probably skip it next time and get dessert  elsewhere.

Service
Our waitress Emily was ok. She asked us if this was our first time there to which we responded \"yes\". Usually this is their cue to tell us a little about the menu or make recommendations. Instead she responded with a \"okay let me know if you have any questions\". She was not the most attentive and we had to ask other employees  to grab our waitress for us multiple times. 

Overall it was a good experience and we definitely  plan on coming back to try out the rest of the menu items"}
{"text":"Me and the husband came on a Saturday night around a little past 10. It was not very busy only 3 tables. We got seated and the husband ordered for us. We decided not to get the Yelp offer of BOGO beer, because we just wanted to enjoy the meal.

My husband ordered the Ronin, Kiki burger and a side of Garlic salt & pepper french fries. We drank water. But I noticed the drink list has grown, also they have a good selection of alcoholic beverages. 

As we engaged into small talk about the menu, decor, and his opinion of the place...out came our burgers, not long after we got our fries. I the presentation of the burger and fries are done nicely.

We decided to half our burgers so, we both could taste each others burger. I loved the flavor of both burgers and fries are very fresh. The server made sure our glasses of water never we're empty. By the way, the server was an older Asian male and with his accent sounded like he was Vietnamese or Thai. I always seem to get them confused. 

Anyways, we definitely will be back because we want to try the rest of the menu. The big plus is that it is open late. My husband and I really like the flavor of the burgers, I had no complaints with the service nor the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best gourmet burgers I've had. I came to Bachi Burger on a Saturday afternoon. Even though there were probably five parties ahead of us, the wait wasn't too bad. After seeing so many Yelpers recommending the Shogun Burger, I ordered that while my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Miso Burger. The beef patty for the Shogun Burger was so juicy and flavorful whereas the Spicy Miso Burger was just meh. Definitely make a stop at Bachi Burger if you love gourmet burgers and you're in town. Don't worry about the $25 price tag on the Shogun Burger; it's so worth it."}
{"text":"I was searching for a flavorful cod sandwich and I found it! Bachi Fish. With \"furikake\" - a mixture of dried and ground fish, sesame seeds, chopped seaweed, and \"bubu arare\" - a Japanese seasoning. Nom-nom-nom!"}
{"text":"First bad experience I had here. Tell us to wait 10 minutes to get a seat which is fine, but then proceed to tell us after our table has been set that, \"we close at 9.. and you can see we are pretty busy... Soo..\" pretty much meaning, we're kicking you out. Thanks for the offer for us to stay - but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. My family and I won't be coming here again. you shouldve just let us know at first."}
{"text":"This place is so good.   Great healthy salads, hangover remedy ramen, and out of this world burgers."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this location due to Yelp reviews and it was so worth it.  We were on our way out of town and starving so got there right when they opened. The music is loud and thumping but you forget that the minute your food comes. I had the Miyagi-San and my husband had the Ronin. We thought we'd each have half of each burger but that didn't happen.  After the first bite you have to sit back and breathe, they are so good!  WOWOWOWOW!  Fabulously tender and so many wonderful flavors. We will go there every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi, not only have you snuck into my top 3 for best burger ever, you have quietly stolen my heart, one morsel at a time.

Ordered the Black and Green and it was just absolutely perfect in so many ways. Succulent patty, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, and blue cheese... oh dear! Even though it was a little pricier than your average burger, it's substantial. And I doubt you'll leave here hungry. None of that Umani sliders masquerading as burgers stuff here. Also the shogun burger with eel and foie gras is mighty rich but fantastic as well! The meat and buns really make the burgers. I don't know what they do to the meat here but it's closer to a fine ground steak than your typical ground chuck.

The fries are just fries, but I definitely am going to come back and try the oxtail chili cheese fries.

And what?! There's a foie gras appetizer? I would have definitely order me some of that if I had seen the sign on the way in.

Service is awesome and Mr. Ho is quite the gentleman.

Goal is to try everything on the menu before 2012 is over."}
{"text":"I highly suggest you try the oxtail fries. The burgers are all great and at over $10 bucks per burger, it better be. I go here at least once a month and every time I go the food is great. The service is either spot on or bad depending on how busy it is. Overall still great."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch thinking maybe we try a new burger spot instead of burger bar. Arrived just after opening at 11am. Plenty of seating since we were so early. Promptly sat down and ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the black and green burger. The chili fries were large, flavor slightly on the sweet side. It would have been a good hangover meal.  The burger was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. My only complaint was that there was something clawingly sweet in the burger that I couldn't pick out. Overall the food seemed to have a sweetness to it that was a little too much for me, maybe not for some. I would say 3.5 stars but I can't give it that on yelp."}
{"text":"I would love to post a detailed, coherent and eloquent review for this place.  All I can really say is that it was amazing.  I went with a few friends on Friday.  We had a short wait for a table for 5, nothing unexpected.  I got the Kalbi burger and it was the most amazing burger that I've ever eaten.  Everyone else loved their burger (with the exception of the guy who got the Mr Ho's burger; he said it was pretty darn good, but didn't rave to the same extent as the rest of us.)  Our group was in town for 3 days, and we thought about going back on Saturday and even thought about trying to go back for lunch on Sunday before our flights.  It's that good."}
{"text":"After going months and months of living vicariously through other yelpers reviews and flipping through countless food porn photos of this place I finally had to venture out of my northwestern corner and make the pilgrimage to Bachi Burger. Too say it was worth every penny spent and every mile driven would be an understatement. We started off the meal with the pork belly steamed buns. The order came with three steamed buns filled with pork belly topped with cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, a Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin sauce. These hogalicious porktastic belly fat filled concoctions will wreck your life.  Pork fat is God and Bachi Burger clearly understands this concept.

Then came the burgers.  We ordered both the Bahn Mi Burger and the Ronin Burger.  We were both huge fans of the Bahn Mi Burger, however we could have done with out the Ronin.  I give them an A + for effort and creativity however the flavor combinations weren't necessarily working for me. Add a side of truffle parm french fries and choose one of the top notch stone or rouge brews they carry and get ready to start loven life.  I will definitely be paying another visit to Bachi Burger in the near future and suggest you do the same.  You'll easily spend $40 - $50 on a meal for two, however this is definitely one of those cases where you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Here currently on a Friday night. Had us wait 15 minutes to sit down in a not so full restaurant. Also made tables after us wait...after being seated for over 5 minutes someone finally came and said \"hi\". No one really had a spring in their step.  All the employees are kinda just hanging out. I know the good here is good but from the service side isn't looking like the greatest choice."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding here and everyone is so pleasant. Everything that i tried on the menu so for was delicious. I love this place"}
{"text":"Meh..burgers around 15 bucks... Had the Ronin..hubby had Spicy Miso..they were good but maybe not as good as the yelp reviews made us anticipate.  Truffle fries were average. The kid got grilled cheese that looked good.  Rogue Hazelnut Ale was really good however. Not sure if I'd give this place another chance. ..there are just too many other choices nearby and they didnt dazzle us for the 80 dollard we spent"}
{"text":"FOOD:  their burgers are tasty, high-quality, and unique.  In addition to the Wygu, I also highly recommend the Bachi Fish which is made with cod.  The oxtail chili cheese fries are also awesome, but are meant to be shared.  Finally, their shakes are also quite good.

SERVICE:  this is their major weakness.  I've been left alone forever before and they have had technical difficulties with their phone system for togo orders.  The serves range from competent and friendly to carless and aloof.

AMBIANCE:  is modern, nice, and clean.  There is plenty of room for parties of different sizes.  They are in a big mall with plenty of parking but it can get busy.

VALUE:  is decent for the quality of the food, but service needs to improve."}
{"text":"If you like special burgers and visiting Las Vegas this is the place to go but go early! 
Wonderful selection of items great salads. 
Friendly staff and good parking 
Very worth a taxi ride!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are here in Vegas and coincidently Bachi Burger was featured on DDD, so we had to check it out and OMG....it is worth the drive off the strip. We had the oxtail chili fries as an appetizer. I liked them, but hubby was not impressed. He thought they were a little sweet, but they are dressed with garlic alioli that is quite tasty. I had the Bachni Burger, which was the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  The meat was extremely flavorful and the condiments that accompanied the burger were wisely chosen and accommodated the flavor of the burger perfectly. We also had the pork sticky buns which were tasty as well. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered a buncha food and didn't regret it one bit!! I saw this place on triple D and I couldn't wait to trek out to Vegas to check it out. Ordered the oxtail fries, truffle fries, truffle edamame, Kiki burger and ronin burger. It was all great tasting. If you're in Vegas you gotta go here ASAP!"}
{"text":"So most everytime a restaurant is on DDD, its going to be good.  This place...EXCELLENT.  Everything was so good.  Had the oxtail fries, they were good, but the lil Bahn Mi (sp?) sandwiches...i'm still thinking about them."}
{"text":"Phenomenal fresh fare with amazing service. As witnessed by Guy Fieri from diners drive ins and dives. Great ingredients combined with serious talent in the kitchen create killer food... Split a burger and an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries... Wow..."}
{"text":"My friends recommended Bachi Burger a few years back and I have been going back there almost every time I make a trip to Las Vegas! I always get the Miyagi-san's burger which is very tasty but I feel like the taste you get from the burger is so strong that you can only eat it maybe once a month. That's why it's perfect for trying if you are coming to Vegas only once in a while. 
Their fries are amazing also! Don't forget to try those.
Service is good and attentive and the food is great. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is purely service based review. I have tried to eat here 4 times. Twice it was really busy and I didn't want to wait an hour for a table, once I waited 40 minutes only to be told as we were being seated that the credit card machines were down....  

Last night was my final attempt. Me and my boyfriend arrived and waited at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for about 10 minutes, about 5 minutes in the guy that was waiting in front of us left, I guess he'd waited too long too. We waited another 5 minutes (the whole time staff buzzing by and looking at us but avoiding eye contact). Someone finally asked if we had been helped to which we replied no.  They took our name and said it would be just a few minutes. Keep in mind we could plainly see 3 or 4 open and set tables ready to go. We sat down and waited another 15 minutes.... and then left. I will never try to eat here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic, cutting edge, high quality and delicious on all levels. Make sure and get to there early because they will fill up! Best burgers in the valley and great ramen. Service is nice and friendly. The menu pops! I highly recommend getting in your car and experiencing perfection."}
{"text":"Tip: the fried calamari is delicious. Their green chutney dipping sauce catches you off guard at first, but is so pleasantly appealing. As has always been recommended, we ordered the oxtail fries-- delicious as well, with the plate being licked clean, but still I'd vote the calamari over it (although not in the size portions). 

Burger: we tried the Spicy Miso, Kiki,  Miyagi-San, and Banh-Mi-- listed in the order that I would suggest them in. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My favorite place that we ate at while in Vegas. The food and service were absolutely amazing. We had the ox tail chili cheese fries, with the pork belly and steamed buns. We also had the burger with the Kobe beef and onion rings, I can't remember the name of it. But all three were equally delicious, and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh and good quality! Must eat if you are in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I'm so full I'm almost crying but we still got dessert.  the oxtail chili fries were so good. The miyagi-san burger was so good. Onion rings cooked to perfection and just delicious. My boyfriend Chris got the spicy mayo and it was a little better in my opinion but mine was still amazing. I recommend this place so hard like if someone doesn't like it, don't trust them. Like don't even trust them with water okay. The burgers are huge and filling as heck too."}
{"text":"So I recently completed my 2nd trip to Bachi, this time with the ever-popular Gordon H, and while the restaurant didn't change much, it turns out that my opinion did. When I originally sat down to write this update, I thought my overall impression had not changed from my first review, but, as I was writing, things developed a little differently. 

Food: This time I had the \"That's Cheesy\" or whatever they call their grilled cheese. It sounded awesome on the menu, but in practice it was maybe so-so. There was a pretty good amount of cheese, and it was made well enough, but it just wasn't very tasty. Without a veggie burger on the menu, this is pretty much the only meat-less entree choice - so I definitely couldn't bring a vegetarian here. Gordon had the Kikis, and, after an initial wave of too-much-garlic, found it to be enjoyable. 

Service: The service was better than Yelp might lead you to think. Adorable Waitress was not serving many tables, which is probably a good choice for Bachi overall, but definitely not as far as I'm concerned. Consequently, we got Generic Asian Waitress. Her service was rendered adequately, but only adequately, and totally devoid of any charm. Say what you want about the flaws of my precious Adorable Waitress, but I'll take the more flawed service that comes with some personality over a technically-superior but totally bland serving automaton. Especially at a small, independent restaurant. Which brings me to: 

New conclusion: Bachi totally needs to up their game. Yes, the burgers and fries are pretty damn good. Yes the food is unique. But the decor is generic and effectively-identical to the numerous Asian restaurants we have in town, the service goes from simply horrible to presentable but lifeless, and the prices aren't exactly cheap. I already find myself bored with the menu after 2 visits, and there really isn't anything else about the place that makes it attractive. One reason I prefer independent establishments is that they FEEL LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT!  Something other than the faceless ownership and bland environs of Chain Food Hell. And when an indie place falters, aspects like cheap prices or awesome service can bolster them. But Bachi lacks nearly all of the positive traits of a small business. Personality? None. Bargains? Zero. Service? Conspicuously lame. So that leaves the food. And while it's admittedly good at Bachi, it's not *that* good.

PRO-TIP: Another for the establishment. MANAGEMENT: Take a page from your competition and BE PERSONABLE! You're a brand new restaurant that only gets by with word of mouth AND you have a unique concept....so why isn't the owner or manager greeting customers when they walk in or sit down, introducing himself and the concept for the restaurant? Not only does it help to better sell the place, but it makes it easier to give you the benefit-of-the-doubt when something goes wrong."}
{"text":"After trying out other food spots in Las Vegas, I found that nothing could really beat the flavors I experienced at Bachi Burger. For that, I needed to update my review to 5 stars. Wish they had one of these in the Burgh- I'm still dreaming about that Bahn mi burger!!"}
{"text":"If you love burgers, you'll love Bachi. Their burger patties are juicy and flavorful. Their menu gives a good variety of burger choices from the cheese burger to Vietnamese Bahn Mi burger. I also loved the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries topped with a fried egg.  Making my mouth water just thinking about it. Mmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Despite being an adult, my parents forced me to go to Vegas (I'm under 21 though so it's not fun...yet *wink wink*). However, I told them that they couldn't just do whatever they want when they got there, so I made them take me here.

I ordered the Ronin Burger, my dad the Mr. Ho's Burger, and my mom the Kiki's Burger. My sister ordered a red velvet milkshake, and we also shared Truffle Parmesan Fries.

As usual, my family and I have patience issues, but that's because we were super hungry. I believe I didn't eat all day prior to having my burger. Anyway, I had the opportunity to try everyone's burgers, and they were INCREDIBLE. Mine, especially. ;)
The texture of my burger was wonderful; the caramelized onions sealed the deal. My sister's red velvet milkshake and the fries were also really good complements to my burger.

I'm glad they're opening another location in LA in the near future, so I don't have to drive as far to get my Bachi Burger fix!

Note: It's quite crowded so be prepared for that and the burgers are a little expensive, but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"OMG, I saw Bachi Burger on DDD, I love pork belly so said to myself that when I get to Vegas, I am for sure going there! Well, I went, I ate, I LOVED! the Pork Belly bahn Mi was FRIGGEN STELLAR! my family had burgers, I tasted all of them, Fantastic, Truffle Fries were great too!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is always on my list of places to go when I am in Vegas. Went around 10pm on Saturday and of course we had to wait, that is never a problem since the food is always so good. Once we were seated, our server came pretty quickly and was nice. That was the best part of our terrible service! Our server took about 10 minutes to bring our strawberry lemonade to the table and after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes, we received our food but never received out appetizer. When we mentioned it to our server, he said that he would get it put in right away. We opted not to get it anymore as we had seen many other tables that came in after us receive multiple things before we received anything. Our server looked as if he was on drugs, very jittery as he attempted to show us his pad of paper showing us our order and saying it was not his fault. Mid way through our meal, we ordered food to go, we sat and waited for over 20 minutes and finally was approached asking if we have received our food. I proceeded to tell the other server that we were waiting for our to-go order. As he walked away, I saw him go up to the register area and find that our to-go order had been sitting in the counter. I could not believe how terrible the service was at Bachi burger! The food is always good, but I felt like the server should never have been serving people food! He made mistakes on every single table he was helping in our area and instead of apologizing, he made excuses!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of guys to eat some burgers.  The atmosphere was nice and the workers did their best to compensate our big group, we had the following:

-Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - with garlic aioli & fried egg - delicious, savory, and addicting, no matter how hard I tried to stop, I couldn't

-Spicy Miso Burger - Angus beef, onions, shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, swiss cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette - a hint of heat, a little sweetness, and juicy!

-Ronin Burger - Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu citrus aioli - also a little sweet but also juicy

Overall, nice place to grab a burger and chill."}
{"text":"After reading the many reviews, I was so excited to try this place. I went on Monday night and didn't have to wait long. We ordered the ronin and Kiki burger with truffle fries. After placing our order, we saw a plate of oxtail fries go by and decided we had to get them. We flagged down our waiter and asked him if we could get the oxtail fries instead of the truffle fries. He responded with that he already placed the order and it's probably too late to change our order. This was less than 5min of placing our order. So, he walked away and updated us 10min later that our food would be coming any minute now. So, we asked him if he was able to amend our order and he replied with, after taking our initial order, he put it in right away and you can't make any changes. If he were to have made changes he would have to pay out of pocket for the $5 fries we originally wanted. Excuse me? When have you ever gone to a restaurant where they can't accommodate you and the waitstaff would have to pay out of pocket because a customer changed their mind? When is it ever acceptable to respond that way to a paying customer? Isn't this a customer service industry? 

I understand if we waited and food was already served, not being able to change your order, but this was seriously within minutes of placing our order we wanted to change. And we are talking about fries here! 

We filled out the form they give you with the bill if you'd like the manager to call you and I even called the next day and left my name and number for the manager. No call back and it's already been 5 days. 

I am so disappointed at this place. The food was good and reasonably priced. You can really taste the freshness of the food. After experiencing the lack of customer service, I would never want to eat at this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   The Ronin burger was beyond delicious.  Sweet potato fries were fresh and hot!  The Brussel sprouts and Asian pears are memorable.

K'Josh was a great host for us and provided top notch service.  Go here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Do your mouth a favor and order the calamari with extra green sauce. If you've ever had crying tiger at a thai restaurant you will recognize some of the same flavors in this dish. This restaurant uses fish sauce in a lot of their dishes which is why they are able to accomplish the umami flavors in their sauces and marinades. This is a gem and not known by most tourists. So thankful someone showed us this place. Will definitely be back. Oh and yes, their burgers are bomb too - ask for a side of Miyagi Mayo for the burger. It's an extra 50 cents but oh so worth it!"}
{"text":"I love the urban and modern feel you get when you walk into the place. The entire menu is posted on a chalkboard on the wall inside. We were quickly greeted and seated by the host and our server was prompt about getting us some drinks. 

The drink menu was fantastic, but the highlight of the menu was seeing Asian fusion inspired cuisine brought to life through the item descriptions. 

We started off with the Pork Belly sliders. What a delight. Braised pork belly, pickled radish, and a hardboiled egg. Yeah, a hardboiled egg...I know. I thought weird at first until I bit into it. Then as I felt the creaminess from the yolk add in that layer of texture to the rest of the soft and plushy bun with the delicate tenderness of the pork belly and crunchiness from the radish slaw...pure bliss, really. 

Next came the chili cheese fries. So let me ask you, how do you make your chili better than anyone else's? Bachi Burger will tell you to add oxtail. And I couldn't agree more! Using oxtail added more depth and richness in flavor to the chili and had us all licking the bowl to sop up the rest of what was left. 

BUT, the highlight of the night was the Shogun burger. This is quite easily the best burger I've ever enjoyed...in all of the land. It's like a super burger consisting of: Waygu grass fed beef, poached Asian pears, pan seared foie gras, mixed greens and a miso butter, between a toasted bun. (What's that you ask?? Did you just read \"foie gras\" on a burger?? Why yes, yes you did.) 

All I could think about when eating my burger was, \"Hello Bacon, meet your new challenger as Burger's best topping, Foie Gras. Your salty, crunchy smokiness may have just been surpassed by your opponent who offers salty, savory and buttery tenderness.\" 

The Shogun has certainly raised the bar on burgers, but low and behold, it comes with a price. It's a $25 burger, but it is worth every bite."}
{"text":"I've been twice and the second visit reinforced the flavorful experience of the first.  In fact, it was probably better the second time.  After hearing a decent amount of buzz about Bachi Burger, the time came to give it a try.  Very tasty and definitely satisfying.

The first visit I enjoyed a Spicy Miso Burger with a side of the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (with Maui onion sea salt and garlic chili aioli).  On the second visit I tried the Ronin Burger and had Just Fries (with sea salt & pineapple ketchup) on the side.  Both burgers were delicious and I can't recommend one over the other, although I think the flavor of the Japanese Cole Slaw on the Ronin makes it my favorite of the two I tried.  My wife had the Myiagi-San's Burger and Just Fries both times.  I loved the garlic fries, but also love the pineapple ketchup that comes with the \"Just Fries\".  I'll face a difficult fry choice next time!
 
A burger and a side of fries is a very satisfying portion, so unless you have a huge appetite your tummy will be happy with these basics.  If you're at lunch with someone and want the same kind of fries, you may want to consider splitting an order to leave a little room to try something else on the same visit.  Needless to say, there's a lot left for me to explore on the menu:  an assortment of appetizers, Bao sandwiches and salads , and I intend to do it soon.

This location is in the Village Square shopping center located at the intersection of W. Sahara Ave and Ft. Apache Rd.  Because it's nestled between the Regal Cinemas and Rocket Fiz Las Vegas, there's tons of parking.  Hungry?  Swing in and give this regional chain (with locations in California and here in Nevada) a try.  It's definitely worth checking out the Asian influenced spin on the traditional American hamburger."}
{"text":"Best Ox tail fries ever! Actually only ones I ever tried but they were delicious like the pork belly sliders. Great service great staff. Make you feel welcome and prices were awesome for great food! One of my new favorite spots"}
{"text":"This place is B.O.M.B. why cant we have one in NorCal??!! Great service, yummy cocktails and amazing food. We ordered 2 burgers, ramen, sweet potato fries and chili edamame and it was all fantastic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was the worst idea and mistake to come here otw back from our Vegas trip.

Where do I even begin?! I'll start with the one pro - Parking. 
Now all the cons - We had to wait literally an hr and a half for our food to come out and arrive when there were hardly any ppl dining inside. That was as long and if not longer than our wait for the oyster bar. And maybe if the food was good then I'd cut them some slack, but even then the wait was unreasonable and inexcusable. The food definitely did not live up to the hype that my friend had said. He said it tasted much better than the Pasadena location which I think closed down, but i thought it was even worse. That same friend I went with also said he heard what appears to be the manager yelling at one of his servers. Yes, the service wasn't good (and he wasn't even yelling at our waitress). But that was totally rude, unnecessary, unprofessional, and uncalled for to yell at a worker in front of guests and customers. By the way, my friend also kindly asked if we could get comped some fries while we wait or in lieu of having to wait and a worker said she would ask our server but no one ever got back to us. Never going back again especially when there 1001 options to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yelp, you have come thru for me yet again!!! Thank you!! We came to Vegas not knowing where we wanted to have dinner, so I searched on Yelp and I was super surprised to find a place with almost 3000 reviews! The intrigue was too much for me, so we decided let's try this!! 

We started with oxtail fries (you need to experience this), garlic chicken wings, and spicy garlic edamame. All three dishes were sooooo good!!! We all got the Vietnamese iced coffee, which unfortunately tasted a bit watered down. It was still good, but didn't pack the punch that I'm used to.

I had the kalbi burger (sooo yummy!!!). The others had the miso burger, manga burger, and black n green burger. Everyone LOVED their burgers. We were completely stuffed,  but we noticed the bread pudding and Portuguese donuts on the menu so we had to try!! Those desserts were amazeballs!!! 

Our waitress was excellent. Everything about this place is great. When we walked in and were told it was a 15 min wait, we were kind of excited because it was the first confirmation that this place is legit! I really wish there was a Bachi Burger in my town.  I kind of want to eat here everyday!!"}
{"text":"Once I saw this empty restaurant finally with a sign that said \"bachi burger\" I was excited!  Excited because I KNEW it was a fusion type deal.  Being from Hawaii, these are the type of resturants I miss!

Sure enough the owners are from Hawaii.  Very down to earth and chit chat a little with one of the brothers (ownders).  One of the owners worked at a bunch of Hawaii fine dinning restaurants that are my favorite!  

Bachi is short for \"HIBACHI\" , which is a Japanese word for charcoal-heated cooking, portable BBQ grill etc.  Livin' in Hawaii, we'll bring our \"hibachis\" to the beach = D

Prices are reasonable for the burgers.  The \"steamed buns\" are great, but I think their over price for 2 pieces.  

I like their beers, its not your usual.  They have a lot of boba drinks.

The decor for the restaurant is modern and spacious.  They have photography art pieces for sale for charity (if I remembered correctly).  

One thing I know for sure is..its open till 2am."}
{"text":"Decent burger but outrageously overhyped. Horrible wait around lunch time and definitely too expensive for what it was. I'd recommend a lot of other burgers before I'd ever recommend this place"}
{"text":"We went there after a movie. I wish we hadn't. The service wasn't great and the food was terrible. We sent back the truffle fries. I told them we didn't want to pay for them and I'm glad they took them off the bill. if they hadn't I would have caused a scene. They tasted old and there was some brown crap on them that didn't taste at all like truffles. I made it very clear to the server that I was very allergic to hot peppers. The sauce for my bao was very full of chiles. I just tasted it and I am still having an allergic reaction to it. My bao was dry without a sauce. The buns weren't quite done. My Wife's burger was OK, but nothing at all special. Her \"grilled onions\" were so thick that they were raw onions in the middle. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was a 5 the service was a one unfortunately. Sat at the bar and never saw the server or bartender exempt for the time they dropped of the bill and food delivery.  Would of loved to drink another Las Vegas bonanza brown but it wasn't meant to be.  The wait staff never stopped by and the bartender never asked.  It wasn't really that busy I was shocked. \"O\" well.  Disappointed.  I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"In fairness to the restaurants I haven't tried yet, I will not come out and say that this is the best burger in Vegas, but any of the selections here are some of the best I have had. Their beef mixture is very delicious and they can actually cook a burger medium to medium rare which is often a challenge for some reason at restaurants like this.  After some of the hype died down and the wait times weren't outrageous, Bachi Burger even became a place to get a reasonably quick meal as well."}
{"text":"After driving past this place countless times, my boyfriend and I watched the sign outside go from \"Yumburger\" to \"bachi burger\" over the course of a year. Especially after trying it's tasty neighbor, Miko Izakaya, our curiousity peaked even more. On a random Friday afternoon while on the hunt for something tasty and new to kickstart the weekend, I checked out my Yelp app to see what food-talk was blowing up and lo and behold, it was Bachi Burger. 

It's an easy location to spot from the street, but the actual door can be a little tricky to find. Once inside, the simple elegance of the asian-influenced decor, homey ambience, and general mood of the place evoked a familiar feeling I couldn't quite put my finger on. I realized, after taking a look at the menu, the reason was because the food is an ingenious blend of hawaiian/asian/pacific island flavors with the never-failing, good ol' american burgers. 

The burgers themselves are fantastic for all the non-typical reasons  usually makes food fantastic-in-a-weird-only-in-Vegas way. They're just the right portion, not too big and doesn't come all-you-can-eat, everything in it is made in-house, even down to the bun, and they don't skimp on ingredients to cut down on cost. Don't get me wrong, I love all those typical Vegas places too, where you can have multiple steak and egg plates for less than $10. But Bachi Burger is kind of like that special girl that comes along only once (maybe twice) in your life and you want to treat her right, where it's the quality of the experience(s) that matters most. 

My boyfriend got the Kiki burger, their most popular one, and I got the Bachi Burger with ground angus. They also have a steak burger, a galbi-rib inspired burger, and a banh-mi burger to name a few of the most memorable. My burger was made to perfection, and by the look on his face and how quickly he ate it, I'm sure the Kiki burger was equally delectable. 

In addition to the amazing list of burgers, there's boba drinks, exotic soda drinks, eco/trade/small business-friendly coffees, and a small but powerfully tasty army of sides, salads, and dipping sauces. Our favorite side was the parmesan fries with truffle oil with an amazing aioli dipping sauce I couldn't quite discern. We also tried the yam (aka sweet potato) fries that had a tangy dipping sauce that complemented the fries perfectly. 

Also, if you're a fan of appetizers, try the chili-garlic-ginger soybeans or the fried chicken pieces.  The fried chicken was so good my boyfriend ate them so fast I hardly had time to try a bite!"}
{"text":"My brother's friend highly recommended on coming here, so we had some time to kill before our show tonight so we stopped by. 

Ever since we landed we have been running here and there so I'm really tired. But as soon as the food started coming and from the first bite, I had a new sense of awaking and caught my second wind. 

Appetizers:
 We started out with some brussel sprouts ($8.50). It is sauteed with Asian pear, with bits of smoked bacon, in sweet soy glaze.  

Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.50) it had a black porcini cream sauce drizzle, topped with Parmesan reggiano and a sun dried tomatoe aioli dipping sauce. 

Last but not least the Crispy \"Tebasaki\" Chicken Wings ($10.00). It was really good. Two thumbs up!

I tried the Kiki's Burger ($13.00) which is an Angus beef patty with sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngil mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyère cheese with garlic chilli aioli. It was really tasty that I real didn't want to share even a bite of it with my better half. 

They also have beer and wine as well as desserts but we were all full so it will have to wait until next time."}
{"text":"Waygu burger miyagi style is amazing. We're from California so we have the best burgers here. This review is not in vain. Came from SF to get this and it was worth every minute on the tarmac at Mcarren airport! Plus the greatest adult playground in the US doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"There are a ton of good burgers to choose from, but my favorite is the Miyagi Son and the oxtail fries are a must. Best Burger in Las Vegas. Game Over! The service is also amazing."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries where so good and hamburger was excellent will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"I love this place! My girlfriend and I come here every time we visit Vegas! One of the best burgers i've had, nothing compares tho bachi. Great customer service, the waiters are always super nice and always suggest great items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Finally tried it after hearing all the hype! Now if it was just food im rating then it would be 6 stars all the way! I dont think it would of mattered what burger you ordered because of our party of six, we all ordered different burgers and each different burger was as flavorful as the next! Pricewise I think is just a bit high to the point that I would only eat here once in a while. Depending on when you go, you might run into some ridiculous wait times which equals to ridiculous service times. When you do sit down, hopefully you took advantage of the your wait time by going over the menu and are ready with your order. So as soon as you sit down, put your order in and I recommend getting appetizers because those dont take as long to make! That is why they didnt get that 5th star from me. I can understand their burgers are made to order but from the time our order was placed until we got our food was about 30 mins. Our appetizers, (we ordered 3 different types of fries, one being the oxtail fries was bomb!). By the time our burgers showed up, I was literally licking my empty plate of oxtail fries cuz it took so long! Overall, I had a decent experience because we went on a late wednesday night. The 4 out of our group of six have been there at least a couple times and they have told me they waited about 45 mins to an hour just to get seated those times."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite gourmet burger joint. They've combined a lot of asian/Vietnamese flavors to make these delicious burger creations that just explode in your mouth. Also, the buns are so fluffy and airy, it's just MAGICAL! 

Banh Mi Burger: MY FAVORITE. This has all the flavors of a Vietnamese sandwich. The added flavors of the grilled pork and the pickled veggies really make this burger spectacular. 

Salt and Pepper french fries: This is also a MUST ORDER. From the sounds of it, it just sounds like they'll throw salt and pepper on your french fries, but it's SO MUCH MORE! They also flavor the fries with fresh slices of jalapenos and little garlic chips. At frist sight, the fries look like they would be extremely spicy (which worried me since I can not tolerate much) but the flavors were PERFECT. Just enough kick to make you keep eating more and more! These flavors are very similiar to the Vietnamese dish: Tom Rang Muoi if you're familiar with that. You must try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I'm a fan but they need to work on their service :) but food is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped here while we were driving through Vegas and wow! These burgers were incredible. Easily the best burgers I have ever had. Everything we ordered was delicious. I had the Kiki burger which was fantastic. My boyfriend got the Black and Green burger (wagyu beef, spinach, blue cheese, bacon)--also delicious. We also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the brussel sprouts---once again, amazing! The fries has a delicious cremini cream sauce drizzled over them and a great aioli for dipping. If you're a burger person, you can't skip this place! Definitely a different burger experience than the norm."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate burger joint. Prices range from 10 to 20 dollars. The burgers are amazing and full of flavor, the truffle fries are to die for. My only recommendation is the the wait staff do a better job at refilling water cups. Usually it doesn't happen unless I flag down a waiter."}
{"text":"Been twice both times were just okay!! This place has so much potential to be great!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I had a better experience here. The food came out in waves. I was finished with my dish by the time my companions meal arrived. The service was bad, and the wait time was unjustified based on the food and service. Probably will never come back."}
{"text":"Vegan and Gluten Free review:

I had a salad. It was the only thing on the menu I could eat. I'm totally fine with eating salads, so that is not the reason for the 2 star review. The 2 stars is for the bad service and bleh salad. 

I had the kale salad with the candied pecans on the side. I asked if the pecans were candied in butter or if they had any dairy/eggs/etc and the waitress gave me a blank stare and responded quite rudely, \"I don't know. We buy them in packages\". I asked if there was an ingredient label I could read and she was all, \"No\". Awkward. I ordered the pecans on the side because someone at my table wanted them for her kale salad (same salad). When my salad arrived, the waitress placed the plate on the table and said, \"We ran out of pecans.\" The way she said it was just so crass and she had a 'too bad' kind of attitude. Whatever. I looked at my salad and it was literally missing more than half the things that it should have had. It was leaves with dressing on a plate. Who thought this looked good before sending it out?! I got the attention of the waitress and asked her about the missing cranberries and avocado. She was like, \"oh there aren't any cranberries?\" Well, that's what I just said, isn't it? At this point, I was totally over dealing with people. When she returned with the missing toppings, she gave a random (and poor) excuse. That was the end of my interaction with her.

Salad review: I didn't like the dressing because I thought it was way too acidic and there was way too much of it. There was no real balance of flavors in this salad and the toppings did not go well together. 

Overall: If you're vegan and your friends really want to eat here, then go for it, but don't say I didn't warn you. If they're up for any burger joint, check out Yardhouse. They have mad awesome service and a great vegan section on their menu (VEGAN BURGER!!!)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, yesterday was the worst this place has gotten. My boyfriend brought his mother here and they say it's the worst experience they have ever had in a restaurant. They were out of the pork that goes in the Ramen so they substituted bacon and the meals were inedible. Even worse it took 20 minutes for glasses of water to come out and they were not served until after the meal. Each employee was seen taking a bite of food before exiting the kitchen and chewing throughout the restaurant and even at tables while taking orders, the hostess was even involved in this. They asked to take home the noodles and were told there were no to go containers they \"couldn't find them.\" We will just go somewhere else and tell everyone we know to do the same. There's too many hard workers out there to deal with this poor poor service."}
{"text":"Awesome experience here.  Our Waitress Carolyn was very helpful and the service excellent.  A colleague and I arrived at an off-peak time, so there were not many people in the establishment, but good atmosphere nonetheless. 

We ordered a burger a piece and shared an order of the oxtail fries.  MUST get the oxtail fries.  Can be eaten as an entree for one.  

I ordered the Shogun Burger.  My buddy had the Miyagi San Burger.  Both featured wagyu beef and were cooked to temp and were stupid delicious.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The BEST place ever.  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and the Truffle Parmesan Fries are the bombs along with the burgers we had.  Ban mi burger was really good!  It took a long time for us to get our table but it was definitely worth the wait!  A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Are here twice and don't think it's all that good.. Don't understand why so many good review. Overrated in my opinion !!
I order Banh Mi Burger, it wasn't bad. The flavor is sweet with a hint of fresh mint and a side of fish sauce(which I don't dip) 
Kiki burger was good..
Oxtail fries..I give it 3 star.. Taste like chili flavor fries, can't even tell if there's oxtail meat in it.. The price is high, I'm better off at my favorite In n Out Burger(cheap n good)"}
{"text":"The portions and flavors are perfect! Love the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Mr. Ho Burger and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to its reputation.  Busy atmosphere and unique food. Hands down the most unique burger I've ever eaten and ranks in the top 10 best burgers I've eaten.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First terrible restaurant experience of the trip today. Bachi Burger HLK went from hero to ZERO! Idk if it's Mondays, Vegas Hangover day, or just plain IDGAF by the staff but the service to the food was just garbage.
We arrived there and was greeted by the head waitress with a \"be right with you\" which was fine but there were many open tables and booths we could just seat ourselves but ok whatever. Then no one came to seat us...it's like what's going on? U got 4 peeps just like totally ignoring the door! She tells one of them to go get seat us. Finally get seated no utensils on the table...thought they were going to bring it later...never did. Just stole some from Neighboring table. Finally get the order in...tell her to bring truffle fries first and kids meal. Says ok walks away. After that...we were invisible. There were like 6 groups of peeps total in the restaurant. We sat there with no attention from the waitress not even a glance over or a lemme check on your food. We wait like a good 30 mins. Finally we gotta flag down our waitress. Then she says lemme check on your order. 5 mins later food comes out...Luke warm. Waitress was like im sorry the cooks lost your ticket and didnt know who to serve the fries to. So basically shes blaming the kitchen for messing up our experience and not getting us our order. Last i checked in EVERY FKN restaurant i been to...the waitstaff deliver the food. So how the FCK is it the Cooks fault? My wife is pissed asks for compensation for our terrible experience. The waitress comes back with a $4 discount on a $40 bill. HAHA. 

Items forgetten: Kids meal milk, kids sundae (ran out of chocolate) if these items are of MINIMAL importance to your restaurant....don't serve kids meals! It may mean NOTHING to your staff but to basically deny A CHILD of their order is the absolute WORST thing you could do! 

Terrible experience and not a great way to rep Hawaii in vegas. Maybe u need to hire some local 808 waitstaff or some peeps that just plain Give a shit about working in your establishment.

I HOPE the owner reads this post because if your business is to succeed you better look into this matter. Pitiful excuses and the blame game doesn't go too far with diners and burger joints are a dime a dozen in Vegas. Also, my 2 year old daughter left hungry. She would not eat that garbage that was served to her and she loves grilled cheese and fries.  #bachivegas #BachiHLK"}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I've ever tried.  I was not expecting all that flavor!! Layers upon layers of pure goodness. It was so big that I had to deconstruct it so I can fit it in my mouth.  Made the process even more fun! I like to get individual flavors, as well as the combination.  The patty itself was fantastic!
I really wanted fries, so I decided to order just the plain ones so I can really get the awesomenss of a good fry...and they did not disappoint. Crunchy, not too salty, and it comes with great homemade ketchup.

Love the vibe...great service...great food.  I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I have had. The pepper fries have sliced jalapeños,  adds a little kick."}
{"text":"Ronin Burger and truffle parmesan sweet potato fries. Amazing. No words to describe! That is all"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Their burgers have very unique flavorings loosely inspired by all types of Asian cuisine. I've tried nearly all their specialty burgers and there isn't a single one I didn't like. My wife really likes the Kiki burger but my favorite is probably the Miyagi burger. I also really enjoy the oxtail chili cheese fries and order them every time I go. This is one of my go-to places to bring friends visiting from out of town and everyone has loved it. Its always packed here for good reason so be prepared to wait if you are coming at lunch hour on the weekends."}
{"text":"Had seen Bachi Burger on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and HAD to go there.  It didn't disappoint!  I had Kiki's burger which had a sweet sauce, arugula garlic aioli, caramelized bacon and some other undefined, but incredible flavors.  My wife had the Mr. Miyagi which was smothered with onion rings and was excellent as well.  If you think you can't do anything new with onion rings, think again. They were incredible!  The place was packed but never lacked in service. They REALLY need to open one of these in Seattle.  Best burger I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Horrible service
Very disappointed 
We were the first guests to arrive at 11am. We were promptly seated. There were three of us. My husband and I ordered burgers with oxtail chili fries and my mother ordered ramen with a side of rice. Our fries came out in 5 minutes. Our burgers came out maybe 10-15 minutes later. But my moms ramen and side of rice order still haven't come out. We were done with our burgers after 10 minutes and still the ramen haven't come out. The female server said it was coming out. Another 8 minutes pass and finally the ramen finally arrives but the side rice still not on the table.  Another 5 minutes or so pass and my mom ask for rice since she likes to eat ramen with rice. The assistant supervisor comes by to finally drop off the rice after almost 10 minutes of asking for it with no apology for the delay and walks off. My mom is so upset that she barely touched her meal. I ask to speak with a manager and she returns. My mom expresses her anger about the horrible service and she talks over my mom and tells us that the rice was not cooked or the ramen. There are two different kitchens. One for the ramen side and the other for the burger side. She also had a defensive attitude. My mom told her that she didn't like the ramen and do not want to be charge for it or the rice. So she quickly grabs the rice & ramen and walks away. Still no apology. I was very disappointed with how she handled the situation. 

An excellent guest recovery for what happen would be for her to have automatically remove the rice & ramen off the bill and offer to comp the entire meal which included the two burgers & fries since our food did not come out at the same time; and they forget to cook the ramen & rice. We had to ask her to remove the ramen & rice off the bill. An apology as well would have eased the situation. It was obvious that they forget to make the ramen & rice. It was a very disappointing dining  experience. The burgers and fries are definitely good but the restaurant lacks management empathy & sincerity. Very very disappointed and will not return because of the very poor treatment that we received."}
{"text":"The best of the best burger I have ever had!!!!! I had the angus burger with salt and pepper garlic fries and it was perfect. Usually I would smother my burger with mayo and mustard but it was not necessary. My husband had myagi san burger and he loved it. Definitely will return. Everyone must try this place."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious and I would go back just for them. The fries were ehh and the service was terrible but the burger was good enough to go back for just that."}
{"text":"Way over rated! 1 21oz. beer, order of garlic fries, onion rings, & 2 burgers will cost you $45.00, not including the tip! Red Robin has great burgers & fast service. If I'm going to spend that kind of money, then I may as well go out for a steak dinner & add a few more bills in my wallet! The music playing is some type of new age trance music, it was very annoying. We had a 25 min. wait to eat on a Sat. afternoon at 1:15 p.m.! Why all the hype? I guess because they were on the food channel."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch after seeing a movie, next door. There were only a couple of people in the restaurant, since it was an odd time. I'm typically not a fan of \"fancy\" hamburger creations, but it's hard not to like this place. Not my favorite burger, but still very good. I had the Spicy Miso Burger, which wasn't spicy, and the Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries. The burger had fresh, quality ingredients and tasted very good! It also looked perfectly built, so it was a shame I had to make a mess of it. The fries were ok, but not what I'll remember. Plus, I was too full from the burger to finish them. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a good Asian inspired hamburger."}
{"text":"Sitting here at my table right now in discomfort in result to the staff yelling and cussing at each other, in full volume so every customer can hear. In my perspective, this type of action is very unprofessional and it definitely gives the place a very bad and uncomfortable vibe. 
Before even being seated, my sister and I heard 2 servers going at it and cussing at each other, to the point where we heard every single word they were saying to each other. 
After 20 minutes into eating our meals, a different employee who was carrying 2 packs of beer, made a scene and yelled at their hostess/busboy who did not move out of her way in time, and said \"FUCKING MOVE NEXT TIME WOULD YA\".  This was not even a foot away from where my family and I were eating.  PLUS next to us we're a family of 3 with a young child, who also heard her as well. Overall, the food is okay but the atmosphere and personalities of majority of the employees here is disgusting. I honestly could not even finish my new because 1.) too much yelling and arguing was happening and 2.) I was just uncomfortable with the vibe in the restaurant. Not going here again and hope they improve the way they speak to their coworkers...."}
{"text":"Finally had my first Foie gras and now I know why it's so prized. The menu is just the right size so you it's not overwhelming. Awesome wait staff and service is quick and efficient. The food was a great mix of flavors from Asia mixed with fusion. Must come and experience awesome food and staff. Come hungry cause the portions are kinda on the big size."}
{"text":"Came by on a Friday afternoon.  The wait was about 20 minutes.  I was famished by the time we were seated.  I swear I wanted to try everything on the menu.  

When our server came by to ask us what we wanted to drink, we gave him our request.  Right before he left to get the drinks, I said, \"We're ready to order.\"  

I guess I may have sounded a bit harsh but only because I was starving.  My sister gave me that look after he left and said, \"Sheesh!  Don't be so hANGRY.\"  Lol  Nevertheless, our server was a sweetheart.  We ended up ordering:

Tonkotso shio ramen: $10
Pork belly buns: $11
Kiki's burger: $12
Oxtail fries: ?

Pork belly buns and the oxtail fries came out first.  Pork belly buns were good but not great.  It could have used a tad bit more pork belly.  I felt the ratio to the pork and bun were a bit off.  The taste was great though. 

Oxtail fries were awesome.  They lived up to the hype.  We had big chunks of oxtail and it was very tasty.  Fries were cooked to perfection.  

Kiki's burger was delicious and very hearty.  We ordered medium rare and it came out perfect.  It paired well with the oxtail fries.  I would definitely order this again.

Only item I didn't care for was the ramen.  Perhaps I'm biased because I had just dined in at Ippudo in NYC a few weeks prior to my Vegas trip.  The ramen tasted a bit fishy. 

All in all, my experience was great and I will be visiting very soon."}
{"text":"This is the first time I eat at this place, and on a positive side I can truly say the burgers and the menu are very unique. The food is freshly made and I was able to sample some of the other burgers that a couple of my friends ordered. I definitely recommend you try the \"Miyagi son \"Burger, and also if you order any other burger and it happens to come with a sauce, definitely use it. I am NOT one to usually put sauces on my burgers but after halfway through my order I decided to give it a try and it truly brings out the flavor in your meal. Something that may need improvement, is that when you go enter the restaurant there is a reception area where they will take your name and seat you, but 50% of the time there was nobody there. We had to wait about 5 minutes for somebody to finally show up and take our name down, but were a little surprised when somebody just rolled in with a suitcase and wrote her name down on the list.???"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in not really knowing what to expect.  We were very pleasantly surprised. The menu had a wide variety of apps and burgers to choose from, so many of which sounded unique and promising we knew if we liked it we would have to come again. We ordered the steamed Pork Belly buns as apps and for burgers, the Ronin and Kiki. The buns were interesting, but just a bit better than okay. Glad we ordered it but no reason to get it again. To clarify i probably would order buns again, but a different variety. Now, on to the burgers...

WOW!!! Both burgers (I tried my wife's Kiki) were amazing! I described it to my wife as an explosion in my mouth. Fireworks were going off... The burgers contained a melange of flavors and textures... I actually used the word melange for the first time in my life! It was an orgasm for the mouth. There was sweet and salty and spicy and juicy, crunchy, soft, and crisp...ohhhhh! Give me a moment, I will be okay. We also shared the Garlic Parmesan Truffle fries... Also wow. Strong and intense in flavor there was only so much one can eat in a sitting... as it strains the taste buds, but not in a bad way.

I had Honeydew bobo tea, which was very nice as well, no worse or better than any I have had before, and the wife had the root beer. Since we filled up quickly we took the leftovers home... by 7 am my remaining burger which heated up well in the micro for 20 secs was gone, down the hatch! My wife finished hers cold. 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is horrible. The waitress brought the wrong order and instead of fixing the order she argued with me and said she was right and that's what I had ordered. I had guest with me and we were all amazed at the lack of class and customer service, at the end the customer is the reason why she has a job!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in the south valley. Food is phenomenal, had the pork belly steamy buns and miyagi san burger. Would have been 5 stars but the service was real slow."}
{"text":"My first time at Bachi Burger and it was a great experience. The atmosphere is casual, the customer service is excellent, and the food was FIRE! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Overall, an overpriced burger not worth the money. The most basic starts out at 10 $ and that's without cheese or anything else, literally. (It's at least 1.5-2$ for each ingredient) The menu is a la carte so no fries either. For a \"gourmet burger\" it was completely bland and I couldn't get over the price with no fries. I would've preferred in n out. Service was great, but I won't be back. With so many burger options in Vegas, don't choose this one."}
{"text":"We ended up going to Bachi Burger  because our flight was delayed due to a possible Hurricane in Hawaii!!! Talk about making the BEST of a junk situation!  I am so glad we did!  The food was amazing and you could tell that the chef who owns Bachi Burger is one Kamaaina!  There pictures of Hawaii all over the place and many Hawaii flavors on the menu! We had:

Truffle Parmesan Fries  - Yum Love the aioli


*Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger 
Chili Mayo  Fried Egg  Furikake 
Caramelized Bacon  Crispy Onion Rings 

*Kalbi Burger 
Angus Beef  Kalbi Marinade
Green Onions  House Made Kim Chee
Ko Chu Jang Mayo

Dynamite burger 
Wagyu Beef - Seafood Dynamite - Fried Egg 

Drinks

Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda
Apple Lychee Soda  

Everything was delicious and fresh and with such great balance of flavors!  We will be back next time we are in Vegas because according to the food channel we missed a bunch of signature dishes. (Oxtail fries & Pork buns)"}
{"text":"Please Don't eat the chicken ginger appetizer it is poisoned our family for four days vomiting and diarrhea nonstop. we went to eat on last sunday with our family and order ginger fry chicken we ate all the chicken and order fry adamame plate too. it was half cooked. burgers are too sweet and they are OK. we never go back to eat and please dont order that chicken appetizer ever!!!"}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner, I stumbled across Bachi Burger on Yelp. It was the morning I was leaving town, and about an hour and a half away from Vegas I realized I had left my phone at the restaurant. I called and spoke with the manager, Paul, and he immediately offered to mail it back to me. He was extremely friendly and very accommodating. When I asked what I could do in return, his response was to just \"pay it forward for someone else\". 

Delicious food, very cute location, and amazing service! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great sit-down meal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"These are by far the best gourmet burgers in town, you can't help but crave them.  Unfortunately every time I come in here the service seems to get worse and worse which is why I only gave it four stars.  Last time I came in our table wasn't even set with utensils and napkins and we didn't get any when they brought our food. Water wasn't refilled entire time. Wasn't busy at all, maybe four tables. Thankfully the food has remained great.  The oxtail chili fries are always a must but make sure you have someone to share with because they're filling. As far as the burgers, the Spicy Miso Burger and Kiki's Burger are my personal favorites. I always go for the Wagyu beef on my burgers too. Really hope service improves because the food is definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 stars but oh wells :/
I went there since my bf wanted to try this place out. I got spicy miso and he got ronin. My spicy miso felt like it was based on korean pepper sauce, which I did not mind but it had weird...sweetness added to it. (maybe it happened when they mixed miso? I don't know) Burger was pretty greasy... :/ My bf didn't really say much about his burger so I guess it's not amazing nor bad!
Honestly it was decent burger... However, the wait, service was below average. We had to wait half an hour for our order and another half an hour for check. Seriously? There weren't that many people. They need to work on their service. No one wants to wait hour for burger! :/"}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to try Bachi Burger with my boyfriend this evening. When we walked in we were greeted by crystal who did an excellent job sitting us down and explaining the menu. Since this was our first time we had a lot of questions. My boyfriend is on a gluten free diet so we really wanted to make sure they offered something he would be happy with. Crystal recommended a tofu burger for my boyfriend  but still had the manager Juliet come by our table to go over the menu with us and get his specific request for his tofu burger. She really did a stellar job with accommodating his requests and making sure our order was correct . I ended up going with building my own custom angus burger with just onion lettuce and cheddar. When the burgers were brought to us my boyfriend was blown away by how delicious his tofu burger was. He loved the teriyaki sauce that they make in house that was drizzled on his burger. My burger was very well cooked well done, super tasty and very flavorful. My boyfriend ended up getting a tofu burger to go for later. I wanted to satisfy my sweet tooth so I got the salted Carmel milkshake to go . What made the milk shake even more tasty was the toasted marshmallows they put on top. If you haven't tried Bachi burger you have to check it out . I don't feel overly stuffed everything is fresh ingredients and most of the meat is organic. The price point is excellent for an upscale burger. We will be coming back soon ! We enjoyed the dining Experience as well as the customer service ."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. If I didn't eat at Holsteins a couple days prior, I would probably give Bachi Burger 5 stars. But in a head to head competition between Holsteins' Rising Sun burger and BB's Ronin burger, I'd have to give the edge to the Rising Sun... but not by much.

The Ronin burger ($9 - caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, sweet bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side) wasn't as sweet as I was expecting, which let the savoriness of the beef shine. The other star was the onions, which provided most of the sweetness I tasted, along with the dressing and BBQ sauce. It's a messy burger after biting into the egg so prepare to use a few napkins. Even with all the ingredients it was a compact burger that held up well after each bite. There were no issues with stuff sliding out the back and falling apart, as can be the case with other burgers with a million ingredients.

One area where Bachi Burger beats Holsteins is with their fries. They're excellent and highly addictive. Truffle parmesan fries ($4) topped with parmesan reggiano, black truffle, chives, a light gravy drizzled on top and a side of sun dried tomato aioli.

They also have an interesting array of non-alcoholic drinks. The jasmine strawberry lemonade ($3.75) I tried was like 3/4 lemonade and 1/4 strawberry slushy on top. Not only was it a great looking drink, the light floral flavor mixed with fruit was incredibly refreshing.

I should have ended the meal there. Instead I ordered one of their specials... an ice cream sandwich ($4) - vanilla ice cream and house-made whipped cream between two chocolate cookies. The cookie was soft, but not soft enough. When I tried to cut into it all the ice cream and whipped cream came shooting out the back. The cookie tasted decent enough, but as a whole the dessert wasn't in the same ballpark as the rest of the meal.

Despite that dessert, this place is highly recommended. It's a great bargain when you consider going to a similar (or inferior) burger joint on the Strip will cost you an extra $10-15 more per person."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the service can be pretty spotty. Sometimes the server is ok, most of the time, the server is absent. As in, forgetting your order (happened on multiple occasions), forgetting parts of your order (multiple times), and more! So the servers are absent a lot because they're off trying to fix things. I've never gone when it's incredibly busy, so I can't imagine what happens then! 

I started going to Bachi Burger after a coworker recommended it to me, since I was new to the area. I love the Kiki Burger & the Spicy Miso Burger. Totally amazing burgers - juicy, flavorful, hearty, the whole nine. I recently tried the Spicy Miso ramen, and it is totally worth a try. Next time, I'd order the spicier version, because the regular spicy didn't have enough kick for me. I personally think ordering the fries (they come separate from the burgers) is a waste because the burgers are so filling on their own, but the oxtail fries do look pretty tasty.

Overall, Bachi Burger is a great restaurant if you're big on, well...BURGERS! They are phenomenal & considering the quality, the prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is nice, but the seating can be a little cramped. They offer other items as well, but I'm clearly partial to the burgers

UPDATE: I have since tried the Oxtail fries & they are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Skip this location! Upon arrival, no one greeted us even if they weren't busy. Then, when the busboy comes to the front, he tells us it's a 10 minute wait. I ask him why when there were numerous tables available and he tells us it's because they only have one server Seriously?? So, we left!"}
{"text":"This place has been recommended to me for a few years now & finally on my last trip to Vegas, I left the strip to try it out. Was it worth the hype? YES!! You know when you head back home & miss food from your vacation? This was it for me! I was skeptical ordering a loco moco that didn't sound traditional. It had a wagyu burger over risotto with 2 eggs, grilled onions, & sriracha bacon jam. It was so flavorful & each part of the meal was perfectly made. I devoured it. My husband ordered a burger also with wagyu beef. Also very delicious, but was $26?! Never heard of a burger that expensive before. 

Service was fairly good. They almost forgot about my cocktail. Everyone was busy trying to keep up with the crowd. Overall, we loved Bachi Burger enough that we'll probably coming back the next time we're in Vegas. 

Heads up! It gets packed so be prepared to wait awhile."}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed the place, the service, and the food! I was in vegas for just a couple of days last week and a friend recommended this restaurant. At first, I was skeptical and I thought my friend was overplaying it. Oh how wrong I was! 

We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly and helpful. We each had a tasty alcoholic drink recommend by our waiter. That was pretty tasty. We had the calamari, truffle fries, Miyagi burgers, and Bachi's loco moco WITH BACON JAM. Need I say more?

Try it out yourself. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tired of your Traditional Burgers?! This place will awaken your palate with all their tasteful, unique, gourmet flavors. The burgers I've tried are scrumptious and are very appealing. It comes out looking exactly like what you would see in an ad. I LOVE fries and the Truffle Parmesan Fries are Heavenly!! 

If your open to Asian Fusion, check this place out!

My Favorites:
Ronin Burger
Kalbi Burger
Truffle Parmesan Fries
The Crusty Crab"}
{"text":"Gourmet Asian fusion hamburgers.  The burgers are a pretty decent size.  I couldn't finish a whole one; but I also had a lot of fries.  Cute modern decor.  We came for lunch on a Sunday and there was a lot of seating open; no wait whatsoever.

Oxtail Fries:  This item is a knockout.  VERY large portion.  It was enough for six of us to share.  Think \"chili cheese fries\" but with chopped up oxtail chunks.  It also has a fried egg on top.  A perfect combination of both salty and sweet.  This item is a MUST TRY if you come here.  Just be prepared because it is a very large portion.

Kiki Burger:  Again, a perfect combo of sweet juicy meat on a buttery bun.  I don't have \"sweet\" burgers very often, but this tasted just like sweet marinated Korean meat but made into a burger format.

Black and Green:  I actually didn't like this as much as the Kiki Burger.  For whatever reason, it had a bit of a bitter aftertaste to it.  Not sure which ingredient caused that.  Not a bad burger, but I preferred the Kiki Burger to this one (and the Kiki was cheaper too)."}
{"text":"Dude...  This place is bomb!  I tired it bc of Guy's tripleD show and while sometimes I have been disappointed with the recommendations on the tv show...  This place takes the cake!  I can not believe how good the oxtail fried were!!!  Amazing!!! And then I got a the best burger I have had in my life (and I recently ate at Burgr)... 5 stars isn't enough for this place!  Try it, I dare you!!!  Thanks for all the help in the past yelper's...  I thought I'd give back!"}
{"text":"Be sure to bring your appetite because after you see the menu you will want to order several things. My fiance and I ordered two burgers, both of which were huge and delivered a pack of flavor with each bite, we also split the Oxtail fries. The fries were so different and I can only describe it like fireworks in my mouth. We couldn't finish it because it's just so much food along with the burgers but we did not regret ordering all that we did. The fries  started getting a little soggy so I wouldn't want to take it back to my hotel. 

Service was just okay and the night wasn't very busy. We came later in the evening and it was during the week. Refills took a long time, which is needed, when you're trying to eat all this rich food."}
{"text":"Really really good burgers here. Waay off the strip, with no good way to get there unless you have a car. But if you can make it, and if you can stand the wait, you're in for a great. 

Our group over-ordered, of course. That being the case, I got to try a bunch of dishes. Most memorable were the burgers themselves- I tried so many I can't remember exactly the names. But one had a decadent slab of foie gras, one had a sublime dusting of furikake, and another was indulgent with onion rings and bacon. 

And the sides were delicious without a single miss. Oh, and the service was great- the waitresses were nice and patient with our large group."}
{"text":"Just stood in this restaurant for 10 mins waiting for the wait staff to acknowledge our presence, the restaurant had probably 15 customers in it- Two wait staff. Finally a young lady stepped up to say 'give us a second' - five mins later she comes back and says give them 3-5 mins to prepare a table. Well, there were 20 open tables...good luck Bachi Burger. Should've known when we saw 7 other people waiting for a table...in an empty restaurant"}
{"text":"I come here often since my first visit. Always get the burger medium rare for great texture and flavor(s).

Best burger place I have been to in terms of the quality of the beef. Their sauces really hype of the flavor and quality of their angus beef. 

Appetizers:

Garlic, Truffle Edamame
Holy edamame! These are jam packed with flavor. These damn soy beans just make me want to stop at the appetizers.

Sweet Potato Fries
I think the fries come out perfect in terms of having flavor in EACH french fry. The sauce is great too.

Entrees:

The Ronin Burger is absolutely amazing! I love the fried egg on top as the yolk breaks during the first bite.

The Spicy Miso Burger makes me want to drool as I am writing this review. It continues to make an individual bite into its soft, delicious warm center. The sauce makes it even better because it is so unique that I can't figure out how to duplicate it.

Their Bachi Burger is also GREAT if you want to just have a plain burger and taste their wonderful angus beef patty.

Every individual in Las Vegas has to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually complain about things like this. However I felt I should post my experience at Bachi Burger. I have always heard good things about this place. I went in today and stood at the \"wait to be seated\" sign to be greeted for about 10 minutes. Didn't think much of it and continued with a good attitude. I was seated, got a burger my friend recommended and fries. 20 minutes later my burger came out. I ask the waitress if the fries are coming, she replies no you didn't order any. I eat my burger, which was delicious. However I get my check to find I in fact did order fries and they never were brought out. I showed the waitress and she apologized. She offered to get a refund for the fries or to get them to go.. I replied no due to already being 40 minutes or so into my lunch here. It came to $20 for my burger and water. And the fries that she forgot about. Overall the food was great. Service was horrible. Not going back again."}
{"text":"Miyagi San and oxtail fries were amazing! Miyagi San was the most flavorful burger I've ever had hands down."}
{"text":"What can I say...I absolutely love this place.  I have been here so many times and have eaten thru the menu probably.  The kalbi burger is by far my fave...the kimchi and spicy mayo...yummy.  I also love the $3 pickles as a starter...and they have boba.  Awesome!  I probably go to this place because although some of the servers this is their first job and need a little coaching they are supernice and its open til 2:00 am most days so another plus on my list.  We live in Las Vegas, the 24 hour place, but too many place close way to early and if you go to eat around 9:00..whoa bad attitude people.  This place is nice too, cause you don't have to trek thru a mob of smokers and bright little machines to get there.  Told you I love this place. :)  My only wish is that they mix up the menu a little more with more specials to suit the season and local ingredients."}
{"text":"So we orginally stopped by the windmill location for a quick lunch, but there was about twenty people waiting at 2pm on a friday afternoon, so we decided to go across town to the new Sahara location since we had to head that way anyway.  I gotta say I have been a fan of Bachi Burger since day one, but I really like the Sahara location the best.    The actual restaurant is larger and the menu is larger too.  We got our fried calamari (which is not on the menu at windmill) and a manga burger.  They were both wonderful.  I really loved the plantation tea too, which they also don't have at windmill that I know of.  Its sweet ice tea but I think it has pineapple juice and mint in it too.  We had the pork belly buns too, and they were as good as ever.  I know since they had been on Diners, drive-ins, and dives they were gonna be even busier but I hope they are still gonna have room for us that have been devotees since day one."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a burger that's not the usual come here. So many different kinds of burger to choose from and all very good. My go to burger is the ronin. So many flavors that just mesh together. The oxtail fries are the best! But if you get Just Fries ask for the Pineapple ketchup."}
{"text":"Oh, my God. 
There has never been a better burger. Ever. End of story."}

So the parking lot is a good size, its in a decent sized strip mall. We got there around 11am and apparently just beat the crowd, cuz as we were leaving the line was out the door. 

First thing I ordered - the Oxtail Chili Fries (minus the onions & cilantro). Now with that out of the way - lets look at the burgers. I decided on the Miyagi-san burger, which consists of Chili Mayo,Fried Egg ,Furikake, Caramelized Bacon & Crispy Onion Rings. I also got a soda to wash it all down with -which the waitress forgot to bring to us til halfway thru the fries cuz I asked again. Anyways - the fries are good. The oxtail is shredded and the the chili has a slight kick to it. The egg while its looks good, actually gets in the way. No one wants to be the first person to cut into it and if it were up to me - I'd pop the yolk and let it run into the chili! 

The Burger - SO EFFIN GOOD! The first thing I noticed was that the buns are actually the same as the baked chau siu bao. Golden brown with a slight glaze. The burger itself was nice and juicy. So juicy that it runs down your hand and arm while holding it. So make sure you get extra napkins. The bacon and furikake was a nice addition! Possibly the best burger I've had.

Overall - great food. Service is good, minus the waitress forgetting our sodas. Totally coming back when I'm in Vegas the next time. 

PS - They should totally change the name of the place. The word \"bachi\" and being in Vegas is not a good thing. Its a good thing I didn't gamble much after eating here."}
{"text":"Spicy miso burger.... Best burger I have ever eaten! Still having dreams about this perfectly cooked little bite of heaven. Oxtail chili cheese fries.... Yummmm. Very impressed will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and the food was simply amazing. I ordered the Mr. HO's burger and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The only problem I had while here was the wait for our food. But that could also show how everything is cooked fresh to order. Will be coming back and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They must put something in their burgers because I am addicted to them!!! Love this place! Whenever I have a taste for something tasty I always think of Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"Step up your service here! I was here on Sunday night. I've had this place bookmarked for awhile. My friends have told me nothing but good things about the food. When I arrived there was a big table open and no one bothered to greet or seat us. Our party was hungry and quicky became irritatted. They finally sat us. I think they apologized to us at least 15 times that evening. We ordered our food right when we got seated. Our food took forever and a day to come out. Our drinks took forever to get refilled. This dinner was tiring. The food was good but the service was junk.. If they gave us some complimentary dessert or drinks that would've been nice. 

I had the Ronin burger with bacon. The truffle fries. and milk tea boba. The burger was cooked medium rare and really juicy. It was a little too sweet for my liking. The fries were really good and the sun dried tomato dipping sauce was really good. The milk tea was average and the boba overly chewy. I can't come back and eat at a place with service this bad. 
My friend got the Kiki burger and that was really good. Spicy mayo dipping sauce made it even better. Please fix your service here."}
{"text":"I've been to bachi burger multiple times and the food is always delicious. It is pretty pricey but every time I received my meal I wasn't disappointed until last night...
My friends and I came here for dinner last night (which we have probably 3 or 4 times) and ordered as soon as the guy came for our drinks. We were pretty hungry it was already 9 o'clock 
The server took our orders left and did not come back for 45 MINUTES. mind you all we got were burgers and fries and there were hardly any people even in there. They brought out our truffle Parmesan fries first (only 1 basked after 45 minutes) when we had ordered 5 of them and they looked nothing like they did the precious times I've been here. $5 for a basket of fries that had hardly any topping on it and looked like it was just thrown together. We waited to see if our friends fries looked the same (they did) and I asked why they were so different and he replied just by saying he would bring some extra condiments out. **mind you we got our fries before our burgers .... aren't you supposed to eat them with your burger??**
Finally the burgers came out which we were excited about being that we waited so long and our fries were already cold. It was nothing like the past times I've been here :(((
We all ordered our burgers medium well and mine and my friends burgers were very well done even burnt on the sides. Usually when you bite into their burgers it's so juicy and so many flavors, but I was so disappointed this time. 
I complained about how long our meals took and that our fries were now cold, but they didn't apologize just said they could bring out more fries but at that point we were full. 

All in all I used to love this place and would rave about it; but after last night I won't be back. 
HORRIBLE service, expensive prices, and the food was not good.
Not sure what happened to bachi burger!"}
{"text":"Went before 6pm, before the dinner crowd and had no wait.  After 6:30pm, this place gets busy but I've never waited more than 20 minutes for a table. Had the Robin burger with a Wagyu patty with a side of Oxtail Chili Cheese fries. It was heavenly, if you're into trying burgers with an Asian twist, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Used to live in town, grew tired of the same old food, whether it be casino food or chain food. Found this place of yelp, HOLY CR*P!  Amazing!  Wasn't crowded, so quiet enough to spend some time talking with the staff.  Kyle is a new server, great kid, by the end of the meal, we got some of his dry humor to come out.  Chef Chris, what can I say other than your food is art.  And your humor made the meal awesome.  Started with the truffle fries, recommend this since the flavor is amazing but lite. Then shifted to the ox tail chili fries, once again amazing, but can overpower the delicacy of the burgers, went with Kyle's recommendation.... out of this world.  Go here for amazing food, and a great dining experience with genuine staff."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype.  I liked it but not my favorite burger place out there.  But if you have not tried I would for sure try it at least once."}
{"text":"Setting of the restaurant was pretty average but their food tho #onpoint
Ox tail chili cheese fries is a MUST try, meat is very tender and the cheese they use was a very soft tasting cheese and use thin slices of fresh jalapenos.  If you like spicy I would ask for extra jalapenos!
Also got the Banh mi burger, there is a dip that comes with the burger.  USE IT!! Not sure what that sauce was but looked kind of like fish sauce.
I will def be going back to try their pork belly/lamb steamed buns.
This place needs to expand either in LA, OC, or SD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and waitress service was awesome. The Oxtail Chili Fries were amazing, as was the Bone Marrow. The Duck Buns were good too. The hostess lacked in being accomodating though. We asked to be seated outside and her reply was, \"Well, the tables are dusty right now.\"  No offer to clean one off for us. We didn't push it but we should have. A better reply would have been, \"Let me have someone clean a table for you\".  Later we saw a party come in and one of the waitresses cleaned it off for them.  Though the service started out on a bad note, the rest of the staff was on their game."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Asian infused burgers I've ever eaten in my life. So you want to experience a gourmet burger from a place that is very understated in their ability to produce one? Then this is the place for you. I was introduced to this place by a friend who had seen it featured on Diners dives and drive-ins. It certainly did not fail to disappoint. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The ox tail fries were as good as I hoped. The portion is plenty to share, too. My husband ordered the Sho Gun Burger and I ordered a bowl of ramen (which is actually next door at Shoku Ramen). I love that you can order ramen while you're sitting at burger place. I also ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer. It was my first time having it anywhere so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a little sweet. I don't think I'd care to order it again but it wasn't terrible. We went on a Saturday around 4:30-5:00 and we waited probably 20 minutes for a table. It got busier once we were seated. I do wish their waiting area was a little bigger."}
{"text":"Mmmm, burgers. If you love burgers, these other reviews are not wrong-- give this place a try. 
For light flavors that complement your meal, try the ronin burger and truffle fries. 
For a more savory flavor to complement your bread and patty, try something like the mr. Miyagi or the oxtail fries. 

Burgers are served without sides. 

This was my first visit, with a large group, and service was great."}
{"text":"Yummy. A bit pricey. Oxtail fries great but 11.50. Great overall. Would come back again. Service wonderful even though very crowded."}
{"text":"I went to Bachi expecting excellence and left a little underwhelmed.  Maybe after reading the reviews my expectations were too high??  I love the concept and I loved the atmosphere, but I just didn't love the meal.  For me, the Ronin was an average burger with a high price tag -  the meat was a tad overcooked, the egg was a little dry and really got lost on the bun.  The short rib steam buns were good....maybe a little more zing was needed to push it to awesome for me. The Truffle Parmesan Fries were tasty but as another review said - needed more gravy and not that original. I REALLY wanted to heart this place, but I didn't find enough ooomph in my meal to make me a die hard fan."}
{"text":"Hamburgers with an Asian inspiration?  Sounds weird- tastes great!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in vegas. It's good that they combined bachi with their ramen place next door. Been here at least 10 times, the food has always been good. Service used to good but now it's very average."}
{"text":"Asian fusion style burgers.  There was a slight wait (about 15 min) during the week around 1pm...mostly due to an hostess that went M.I.A.

I ordered the Peking duck steamed buns, the hubby had the Kiki burger and we split truffle parmesan fries.  The steamed buns were okay.  The flavors were pretty flat without the hoisin dipping sauce.  I'm not a big fan of food that requires sauce to make it better, but the sauce made it better than blah and boring combined.  They are served like sliders with three slices of duck, a slice of hard biked egg, a radish sliver and a bunch of cilantro folded inside each bun.  The three small buns were more of an appetizer than an entree.  The hubby's burger was much better in comparison; big, juicy and full of flavors.  The truffle fries were also pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Cute spot. Nice, cozy atmosphere. Amazing thai iced tea, burgers cooked perfect. Good service. We like this more than summerlin location. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Burgers re-imagined in the style of popular Asian comfort food...fusion disaster or synergistic food nirvana?  That was the question I sought to answer when I stepped into this southeastern joint with my sister visiting from out of town and two other friends.  

Beginning with an appetizer: 
Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries \"garnished\" with a sunny side up egg...let that concept wrinkle your brain for a minute,

Portion is definitely worthy of sharing with 4.   Shaq would have better luck winning a game of Jenga than my attempting to eat this with one's hands without making a hot mess.   Armed with forks, we broke the egg all across the beautiful pastiche of crisp golden fries, hearty oxtail chili, and luscious gooey cheese that harmonized in a beautiful symphony of texture and flavor.  

The hardest part was deciding on burgers, so we each agreed to order a distinct burger and cut them into quarters for all to sample.  Although the waiter suggested we order them medium, I think we chose wisely with medium rare.

Burger #1 The Ronin

In the movie Ronin, when DeNiro's character is asked about how he avoids an ambush, he replies \"Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\"  When I glanced at the description and read the reviews of my trusty Yelpers on what appears to be the gold standard of the Bachi Burgers, I had no doubts this one was going to be a winner.  Perfectly cooked patty topped with some nuttiness from miso-goma dressing, tanginess from Katsu bbq sauce, crunch from the Japanese slaw, binded together with the runny yolk of a fried egg and then slathered with a citrus-yuzu aioli, if you haven't started drooling on your keyboard, perhaps you need to get your salivary glands checked out.

Burger #2 The Kalbi Burger

Somewhat of a misnormer since they use ground beef and pork rather than the marbly beef short rib from which its name sake is inspired, but nonetheless well executed.  Along with a korean-inspired mayo, green onions, and a healthy punch of kimchee, the flavor profile is great although I would have preferred a stronger spice component with hotter chili paste.  Nice touch with a banchan accompaniment of spicy korean pickles.

Burger #3 \"The Crusty Crab's replacement\"

Can't recall the name of this one since it was one of the specials and is supposed to be the replacement for The Crusty Crab, which was essentially a crabcake sandwich, but this one is like a Steak Oscar between two pieces of bread so I'll temporarily call it the Krabby patty, in honor of Spongebob Squarepants.  Beef patty topped with crab, scallop, a fried egg, and some crispy vegetable component that has slipped my mind, Plankton would gladly hatch a scheme to serve this burger to compete with the Krusty Krabs.   

Burger #4 Spicy Miso Burger

Highlights include Angus beef, roasted garlic, apple vinaigrette (side note: totally would have missed this word in a spelling bee because of that sneaky extra i), and shishito peppers.  This one was like the cute girl next door standing alongside the other three supermodels of burgers.  Nothing to complain about, but not much of a revelation either.  The finely shredded lettuce has a propensity to lose its crunch amongst the liquid components without providing any added flavors like a spicy arugula.  Don't be intimidated by the name, as shishito peppers are not considered anywhere close to spicy as its other Asian cousins in Chinese or Thai cuisine...not really sure if I could even make it out, which probably relates to the final point: the apple vinaigrette overpowers the other mild components so that you don't get the popping off of distinct flavors as in the other burgers.

In summary, the patties were well seasoned and sufficiently moist, the brioche-like bun is probably personal preference since it is soft and heavy as opposed to light and toasty (reminds me of the baked pork buns at dim sum), although I would have to say the Ronin comes closest to living up to Barney Stinson's highest compliment for any budding burger connoisseur:  \"I love this burger so much I wanna sew my ass shut!\""}
{"text":"Everyone was raving about the oxtail chili cheese fries but it just tasted like a regular chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Nothing extravagant. But the fries itself was pretty good. 

I originally ordered the Kiki's burger and my husband ordered the Miyagi Wagyu burger but then I totally changed my mind so we switched burgers. I personally like the Miyagi burger better. It reminded me of the Manly burger at Umami burger. And my husband says he liked the Kiki's burger better so I guess it all worked out. 

I'm giving it a 3 stars because their food is really yummy but it's also expensive. Also this is the first place in Vegas that has decent boba. I've searched long and hard for boba places that can give me almost the same thing I had in California and this place came pretty close. The only problem is, like I said, it's expensive. And such small portions. But I mean overall I'd still eat here again."}
{"text":"Here is my experience with Bachi Burger.  I went in after work to order a burger and salad.  I was directed towards the bar area and I looked over the menu.  I ordered the Myagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger that comes with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, caramelized Bacon, crispy onion rings for $15.00 (it used to be $13.50 in 2014). The waitress asked how would I like it cooked and I told her medium. I asked the waitress if they could substitute the caramelized bacon for sweet onion marmalade and she said she can leave the caramelized bacon off but she would have to charge me for the sweet onion marmalade as an add on $1.50.  I reluctantly agreed and added a market salad which came with spring mix, heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots and a champagne vinaigrette $5.00.  So the burger and salad plus tax came to $23.24 before tip to which I tipped $3.00 since It was take out to a total of $26.00.  When I paid the waitress she told me to give the $30.00 to the bartender to get change and he gives me back $6.76 ( a five dollar bill and a one dollar bill with the .76 in change.  Now I don't know if he thought that someone should get $1.76 or a $5.00 tip for take-out.  I'm not cheap by no means but I tip what is appropriate since I myself work in a tip job.  I had to ask him for change for the $5.00.  That didn't bother me too much but I felt I should add it to this review because that was the (tipping point).  When I got home I opened the burger and it looked good and messy but when i looked inside they left off the Furikake which really gives it a distinct flavor, luckily i have some at home so no big deal, but when I took a bite the burger was rare in the middle an hard over-cooked on the outside, not medium like I asked for. Plus if that was grass fed I really couldn't tell it didn't taste better than any In-and Out Burger that I ever had.  The company where they get their meat from must be inferior to others. Then I go to the box that was containing the salad and I opened it up and no salad dressing.  I called them up to tell them about the mistakes.  I was told I could come back and get the dressing with apologies.  I also told them about the burger and they just gave me this puppy dog look like I'm so sorry.  I told them that's okay and walked out of there vowing never to return.  Well if I want a burger similar to the one I ordered than I can go to Fukuburger and get it for $7.99 + fries $3.99 + drink $2.55 + $3.00 tip for  $19.00.  There are plenty of burger joints wanting the extra business that don't gouge their customers and will sub out ingredients at no charge.  So dine there if you like to spend money.  You won't see me there.  The STAFF were nice I do have to say.  I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.    Small kind wait which was largely exaggerated by the hostess.   Food and service were awesome.   Can't get over how good the food was.    Bloody's were unique and you either lived them or not.   Burgers and fries were beyond bitchen!   So delicious!    Bravo!  Mahalo!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bachi Burger. I came around 5:50 with 3 of my friends, and the hostess said our wait was going to be around 25 minutes. We walked to the bar to wait, and less than 5 minutes later, we got seated! Awesome

We got seated and our server introduced herself as Aubrey.

I ordered the Bachi Fish and added grilled onions and roasted garlic. I also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries with added garlic and fried egg (because I can't get the oxtail fries - I don't eat meat). So I made my own version sans meat with drizzled chili garlic aioli lol. 

My friend Mike L ordered the Shogun Burger (with wagyu beef and unagi - $25 burger!) He really liked it and thought it was worth the amount he paid.

My friend Stella K ordered the Spicy Miso Burger, which our waitress highly recommended as her favorite burger, and she added grilled onions. 

My friend Ritchie J ordered the Miyago, which he really liked too.

When our food came out, our waitress Aubrey fucked up our order and brought two bachi fish burgers, when we only ordered one... My bachi fish burger had no garlic either, although I specifically said to add garlic. Once we were almost all done with our burgers, my friend's spicy miso burger came out... How could our waitress get her order wrong when she's the one who recommended the burger? ... Horrible service. We also ordered the pork buns, but when my friend's miso burger came out we asked where our pork buns were and she hadn't even placed the order!

The food was good, but the service was shit. If I ever do go back to Bachi burger, I wouldn't go to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing.   Exquisite flavors!   The buns were perfectly warn and soft,  all ingredients are fresh,  the onions rings are sliced fresh with each order,  their basil jalapeño sauce is out of this world.   I had the cod burger with avocado and WOW, just wow.   Nice variety to choose on their menu."}
{"text":"tldr

Definitely one of the best burger spots in the city but very far from where I tend to be around. Friendly servers and free wifi.

Got:
-Kiki's burger: cooked perfectly, sweet onion marmalade paired perfectly with the sautéed shiitake and enoki mushrooms. 
-truffle parmesan fries: honestly could have done without, ended up being too salty for my taste"}
{"text":"Ended up having the shogun burger with fois gras, unagi. Was one of the better burgers I have had. (Also one of the most expensive, but worth it.) They definitely have their own unique take on bone marrow jam and the oxtail chili cheese fries. I wasn't a big fan of the sweetness of the jam, but it was prepared well."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is easily THE BEST custom burger restaurant I have ever been to, and I miss it dearly now that I live in the Bay Area. I've had dreams about this place, and the withdrawal levels are running high, at this point.

My wife and I used to live pretty close to the Windmill location, and we frequented this location about a dozen times. We've tried a number of the burgers there, as well as the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) as an appetizer. These oxtail chili cheese fries are amazing. They have garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of fries with oxtail pieces on top of it... incredibly tasty, even if you aren't traditionally an oxtail fan.

With regards to burgers, my personal favorite has always been the Kiki's Burger ($10.00). I recommend this burger if you are a big mushroom fan. This burger is packed with sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms in it with caramelized bacon, a sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, with a garlic aioli spread. One of the unheralded parts of their burgers is the amazing bun that they use for the burger. It is toasted just perfectly, and it complements everything in between the buns. The patty is always cooked and seasoned so well. Extremely juicy, and it blends perfectly with the mushrooms, cheese, garlic aioli and the rest of the amazing ingredients. The Kiki's burger is to die for.

A lot of other people also love the Ronin Burger ($10.00) because it has a fried egg in it, along with caramelized onions, some sort of Japanes cole slaw, and a Yuzu citrus aioli. This is the one that my wife and my cousin always order and they absolutely love it. This one gets a little messy though because of the egg, but it's all a part of the experience. 

For side dishes, I always recommend either the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.00) or the Sweet Potato Fries ($4.50). Both are served with an aioli dipping sauce. It is a generous portion of fries served in a large cone shaped serving container, and 1 order is more than enough to share among 2-3 people, unless you are a beast when it comes to fries, and can finish the entire order by yourself!

I don't really have any complaints about Bachi Burger, other than the fact that the wait can be a little long, but when it's worth the wait, it doesn't matter how long the wait is! I've waited an hour before, and it made us savor the meal that much more! The only other thing that I wouldn't recommend are the boba drinks that they serve. Just wait to get a real boba drink from Chinatown after you have finished your burger. I wasn't too thrilled about the taro boba I tried once, so I never ordered it again. Other than that, everything else is flawless. 

We can't wait to get back to Vegas so that we can visit one of the two Bachi Burger locations. I don't rate very many places 5-star at all (check out my reviews), so when I give something a 5-star rating, I am not joking around. Haven't found a burger place here in the Bay Area that comes remotely close to the quality and taste that I miss from Bachi Burger!!"}
{"text":"Food is way too sweet!!!!! The service is the worst part! No one checks on u, or greets u when you sit! It is awful!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"Banh mi burger, wow what a weird taste I got from it when I first but into the thing but boy I gotta tell ya it was pretty good. They have here the weirdest burgers you can imagine. Asian infused burgers is what you get really. Very awesome service here and friendly, attentive and defiantly get what you need going. Must try their Ox tail fries! Sounds weird and all but it's so delicious! In fact most their menu items sound a little not right but it's pretty promising alone it being around for some quite time now. Definatly gonna come back to try other items though!"}
{"text":"Japanese style handburgers?!? How often are you going to hear that together. That's what attracted to me to this place and in through the front door. 

The 1st time I came I ordered the Shogun burger (Pretty sure that's what it's called but it's the most expensive burger that came with kobe patty, unagi, foie grais, etc) and when I first bit into it, it was a taste that immediately wanted me to savor all of the delicious flavors. There's so much flavor in the burger that you could taste the foie grais, unagi, and sauce and enjoy it to it's fullest. You really have to give this burger a try if you go here.

I did come another time and tried the other burger which I believe was the ronin but it did not have nearly as much flavor and would definitely not be that great of an experience. 

Your burger doesn't come with any sides like fries so be sure to order some if you'd like. 1 order of fries can easily feed at least 2 people and possibly 3 so don't order one for each person. I also tried some of the drinks like the strawberry jasmine tea lemonade and the momotoro peach drink and they were both not very good and not great drinks to compliment the food.

This place is off the strip so may not be worth it if you have to taxi to get there but if you do make the effort to come out here, you would be punishing yourself for not getting the Shogun burger. I wouldn't even come here again if I didn't order that."}
{"text":"As the flavors of my Green and Blue burger flavors burst into my mouth I secretly thought this was most definitely the best burger I have eaten. But, I should clarify that this isn't the best burger-tasting burger. It's just an amazing cornucopia of flavors that all seem to come together as one to create a complete sense of food satisfaction.

The Green and Black burger was made with grass fed beef and topped with bacon, blue cheese, mushrooms and spinach I believe. As I said before it was simply awesome. We also shared an order of Parmesan Truffle fries and the pickle appetizer. The pickle sample was really good - only one was hot and the pickled garlic was one of the most interesting on the plate.

Besides food, Bachi Burger makes some really interesting drinks like the strawberry jasmine lemonade I had with my dinner. The atmosphere is quite simple, almost the opposite of the complexity of the burgers. And if I lived in the area I would definitely come back again and again to try everything from the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger to the Crusty Crab."}
{"text":"First off, I only review burgers.  Heard about this place from my friend Les.  Went here with my mom who is NOT a burger fan.  I wanted to order 2 to split with her so I could try 2 burgers so I was going to pass on the fries.  She said, get the fries, I'll eat my share.  After the food arrived, she appeared to be enjoying the meal.  I asked her, \"What is the best burger you've ever had?\"  Her answer...\"This one.\"

Update: Buns are like honey glazed dim sum baked Cha Siu Bao.  PERFECTION!  Currently the undisputed best burger in the Las Vegas area for me.

WHAT I ORDERED: 

Ronin Burger - 5/5 very juicy and flavorful!

Shogun Burger - 4/5 also very juicy and flavorful!

Kalbi Burger - 4/5 solid!

Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries - 4/5 awesome complement to the main attraction

Truffle Parmesan Fries - 3/5 ok...not sure what the brown sauce was. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - 3/5 ok, but not memorable enough to order again


STAFF: 
Nice.  Our waitress was quick and friendly and sported some cool tattoo work.

WAIT TIME:
Went a little early on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait.

PORTION: 
Good portion. Just the right size. 

BANG FOR YOUR BUCK 
The portions and quality of burger match the price well.

WOULD I RETURN 
Yes!"}
{"text":"A million stars. Hands down the best burger on the planet. Opulence in burger creativity. Shogun. Sho nuf! If you haven't done it do it. If you've done it do it again."}
{"text":"Well, first the wait was long, so I figured there must have been a good reason. There were many tables open for so e reason though.  We stayed, and got some drinks at the bar while we waited. First, my husband got a milkshake and thought it would be cool if they could put a shot in it. Since it WAS a bar and all. Well, the bartender obliged, but all the while telling all of his coworkers how crazy it was and weird and laughing about it. Making us feel pretty bad.  So we sit down, it's freeeeeeeeeeeezing cold inside. People are visibly shivering. We get our meal, I got the no meat burger, the consistency was so weird and mushy,it just feel apart in my hands!!( I've had plenty of '.no meat' burgers that at least had the consistency of a burger!!!!!)  The waiter was supposed to deliver us our fries with our burgers, but he comes back to our table, when we inquire about them and acts as if we NEVER ordered them!!!!!!!! He said it would be another 5 or so minutes.. By the time we would have gotten those fries my burger would have been STONE COLD!!!!! So I said forget it, lets just go....... It was an awful experience, never going again. Honestly, I felt like I was in that show \"Kitchen Nightmares\".... Get a new manager for real. 
THIS PLACE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Miyagi-san burger, KiKi's, and truffle fries.  This was plenty of food for two.  The Kiki burger did not have much caramelized onions, which was the flavor I was craving for.  The Miyagi-san burger was delicious.  My favorite part of that burger was the fried onion rings.  Overall this place has great service and good food, I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Oxtail chilli cheese fries-10!
Ronin burger (medium)-10!
Even their coffee was amazing.  Very reminiscent of Flip Burger in Atlanta.  A boutique-y burger joint that really backs up their reputation as being one of the best burger restaurants in Vegas.  I love Bachi Burger!! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Truffle and Sweet Potato Fries. So delicious! Love it :)"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I'm always extremely happy. The service is amazing and the whole crew, not just my server says thank you as I left. They paid close attention to details such as refills on my AMAZING plantation tea, everyone should try it. Now the food! I custom make a BBQ burger with bacon, cheddar, and onion rings. The bun is delicious and unique. The patty is big, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. And the rest is just as amazing. I would recommend Bachi Burger to anyone. They truly have the best burgers in town!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place from Diners, Drive ins and dives, and was in the area so I had to check it out for myself 
Awesome burger! Pribably one of the best I've ever had. 
 Cool vibe, friendly staff.  Overall a very nice place to enjoy a lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Update to my review from a few months ago:

Revisited Bachi Burger today for lunch. Had the Miyagi-San Burger and the Salt & Pepper French Fries. Both were epic!

The burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare) with bacon, furikake seasoning and onion rings. 

The fries were the possibly the best 'dressed up' fries I've ever had. Topped with onion salt, cilantro, fresh jalapeños, lemon grass (?) with a delicious dipping sauce. 

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This review is solely about the service. I have been dining here since they opened. I have brought family, friends, and my boyfriend here. I have never been so disappointed with service until tonight's visit. I was asked what I wanted to drink and I said water. Few minutes later the bf got his soda, but forgot my water. We were sat right next to the kitchen, so it was hard to miss us. Servers, busser, hostess, and managers passed by me all the time. They saw me not having my drink on my table. I work in this industry, and I know how hectic it gets during busy hours, but to not even drop off a glass of water!?!? I wanted to wait until anyone noticed that I haven't had a drink in front of me for more thank half an hour. Unfortunately, no one noticed. My burger finally came so i just asked the food runner for my water. Seriously Bachi Burger?!?! My burger came first than a glass of water? Guys, train your staff properly or your business will go down as quickly as you went up. If I was a secret shopper your business would have been in deep trouble. I have seen you guys grow since you opened, and I am very disappointed with the service. The last time we were here my bf wanted a milkshake. He waited for his shake longer than I waited for my water. As we were almost finishing up our meals the server goes up to us and informs us that they're out of milk. Our recent experience here really reminded me why we do not dine here often. Guys, step up your game! How can you mess up something so easy like water? Tsk tsk Bachi Burger! :("}
{"text":"Freaking delicious burgers!!  If you're coming here for their ramen, you're coming here for all the wrong reasons. Get. Their. Burger!  And the truffle butter fries!  

The spicy edamame starter was a hit.  They were super flavorful and plentiful, but it took a while for it to come out.  5 minutes into eating them, our entrees came out.

The chicken wings were a bit off for me.  They were crunchy, but kinda warm in the middle; not piping hot like fresh chicken.  And a bit on the dry side...

The ramen?
I made the biggest mistake by getting their ramen because I almost always instantly regret not getting the burger.  The ramen is good here, but it's super f'ing greasy!  Which is strange because their fries and burgers aren't as greasy as their ramen...?

Service is a hit or miss - depending on what time you come in... I've seen people walk out due to service.  (They've been sitting there so long without service, that I was getting pissed off for them)."}
{"text":"Home of awesome asian fusion burgers where the kalbi burger is highly recommended. They also serve wagyu beef burgers at a much more reasonable price than high-end dining establishments. If you're not feeling hungry for a burger, they have a good selection of other fares. The duck bao was ok though not a fan of the slightly bitter greens in the bao. A major complaint would be that the service is awfully slow so don't plan on getting a quick lunch here."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has become my GO TO burger place every time I am in vegas ( I go at least once a month)  

I was in Vegas for a night and had my friend pick me up just so I could eat bachi burger, we went to the West side location, this location is a lot larger than the Henderson location I have been to.  The servers are super friendly and talkative.  We were seated immediately as there weren't that many people there on a Wednesday night.

I ordered the coconut taro milk tea $4, and my friend had one of their IPAs on tap. 
The coconut taro milk tea wasn't very good, it wasn't creamy or taro tasting at all, I think I will just stick to their burgers from now on. 

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries $11.5 to start, this dish was huge!! They gave a massive amount of fries, chili, and cheese.  I think this dish could easily have been split between 6 people instead of 3.  I ordered the Miyagi burger medium rare.  The burgers took about 15 min to come out, which was totally fine because the burgers here are always cooked perfectly!! 

My burger was delicious, the perfect combination of savory and sweet ( not too sweet mind you), the beef was soo juicy, and the bun was soft and fluffy.  Sadly I couldn't finish my burger because it was just too big.  I have had 3 -4 burgers here and have never been disappointed.  Next time I will probably try their fish or their \"no meat here burger\"!!"}
{"text":"Obviously, most of the reviews here are friends of the restaurant. 
Positives 
1. DIRT CHEAP
2. Great Ideas with menu

Negatives
1. Overcooked
2. Cold Fries
3. Very few \"healthy choices\"
4. For a brand new place they should work hard to make customers come back and ask their opinion

I will try them again hopefully its a better experience and they figure out timing the food especially fries were cold. I would have sent them back but no one asked me how anything was. Also it is stupid to have to pay the cashier. The server is getting tipped take my money to the cashier for me. duh..  HAS POTENTIAL NO DOUBT hopefully they are not too arrogant and listen to customers or maybe even ask them how things are???

Update also to 5 Stars these guys got some great food.

Bachi Has majorly improved lately. Good cook times, the food was always good. Service 1000x better. A lot of the original servers seems like someone trained them now.  They fixed the cashier,  It seems to be a little pricier or I'm just more broke lately. Fries could have been hotter but not cold by any means. Lonely Bird is where its @. I think they have made it sweeter more sugar in marinade. The pickles are super fun."}
{"text":"This place never dissapoints.  Every burger I've tried has been delish and their buns remind me of Krispy Kreme.  Maybe because they're fluffy and baked golden brown...I dunno.  The brandy milkshake is something new I recently tried and didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally made it here on our most recent trip to Vegas. I had seen it on DDD and it looked amazing. 

We arrived at about230pm on a Friday. It was packed. We had to wait 10 minutes. We had
Pork belly steamed buns

Oxtail chili cheese fries were amazing!

And because it is a new thing we tried their Tonkotsu Shio ramen which was amazing also!

We see told there are 2 kitchens: one for ramen and one for the burger for one restaurant. Whatever the food was amazing!

This place is much better than most of the DDD places weave tried. We can't wait to come back on our next trip to Vegas. 

Service was 5/5."}
{"text":"Hands down my FAVORITE burger place in Vegas and ever! My coworkers and I go weekly. I alternate between a burger and Bachi fish. Salt & pepper fries are the best ones! Stir fried edamame is the best of those."}
{"text":"#OxtailChiliCheeseFries !! Oh my gosh. We went back 1 week after our first visit, for that.

Servers are friendly and attentive, knowledgeable. Food is great. Great beer selection. Can't wait to try their seafood and veggie burgers, and have another #OxtailChiliCheeseFries !!"}
{"text":"Had the kiki burger with the standard fries. The pineapple ketchup is awesome. Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Stars were earned only for the food. It was good tasting overall. However we waited a while outside waiting for seats and then were led into an entirely empty section of the dining area which seemed to be the ramen part of the space. I personally don't like waiting when there are sooooo many empty tables. The waitress was friendly but our food took forever to come out even after she said they were just plating the dishes. One of our party had the ramen, waited to see if we got food, we told him to eat before it got cold and he slowly ate. He finished his meal before we got our food. Overall food was good but the timing of service was terrible."}
{"text":"Bachi burger never disappoint me. Ever! I love this place and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends. I love how they collaborate with \"shoku\" (I believe that's the word, not sure) anyway, love their soup."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped. While the food is good, I feel  that it's nothing to write home about. Ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, angus burger, kiki's burger and I wasn't wowed by it, the portion is small also. Also ordered an apple lychee soda but they never serve the drink but was charged for it. CHECK YOUR BILL! Also, server was slow and inattentive, took forever to get the check and we probably sat there for 15 mins after the meal, and it wasn't busy when we were there."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Bachi Burger has a location on my side of town :-D This place has been on my wish list to try for months but yet getting to the otherside of town wasn't always easy for me. Now I have no excuse ;-)

So what happened here to make me so giddy about this place.....Well for starters they gave us these fried pillows of veggie goodness as a thank you for trying the new location :-) I love getting little free goodies to try, it just makes me feel loved;-) Then they gave my daughter who is 2yrs some things to play with since they saw she was getting squirrely...again another thing to make me feel loved :-) Those with toddlers know eating out can be a handfull sometimes and when you have a staff that cares about your experience they tend to help you out as much as possible. The waiter was on it with our beverages and making sure we are good yet not hovering over me like I'm his only table which I might have been because the place just opened so it wasn't very busy. 

Now lets talk about the main reason why I wanted to come here...da foood! We ordered Oxtail fries for starters and boy you could easily share them with 4 people! My buddy and I had to stop ourselves from eating any more for fear of not being able to even start eating our burger :-/ I ordered the popular choice the Ronin and it lived up to the hype which was always good :-) My buddy got the Waygu Burger which was good but he liked my Ronin better and I ordered a Ban-mi slidder for my little girl and that was so scrumptious :-D 

I can\"t wait to go back next time cause I'm thinking about the Ban-mi burger and a salted caramel marshmallow milkshake to top it all off ;-) Yippee for gym memberships and cheat days or else I would be screwed!!"}
{"text":"I had the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries as featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives. Awesome!  The burgers are super delicious as well and really great service."}
{"text":"My expectation for Bachi Burger was a little to high! Everyone I know who's had both Bachi burger and Fuku Burger said I'd like this place better but I highly disagree!!!! I had the miyagi san burger and the oxtail chili fries because it was recommended by friends and yes the were both good but not great. The burgers are a little over priced and I personally think Fuku burger has more flavor. I had to give this place a 1 star due to the service that we received here. When we walked in we were not even greeted by the filipino girl who I guess was the hostess. She didnt look to happy to be there either. Our waiter was this feminine guy who wasnt to friendly either. He didnt make us feel welcomed nor did he introduce the menu to us. He asked us \"what do you to drink and what do you wanna order?\" Literally! He didnt come to check on us once we received the food but was quick to cash us out. I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone and its sad because I saw it on food network as well and was so excited to try this place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, mainly for my husband's sake because he loves oxtails. I live across the street and for years I've tried to convince him to get the oxtail fries. It's about 8:30pm and I finally convince him to go. First if all, the 2 start reading is because if the large portion.... that's all. We walk up to the front where someone is waiting to stay you. We tell him we just want to order the oxtail fries. He directs us to the back where the cashier is. We wait around for a few minutes then finally another guy and the original guy we spoke to up front to ring us up for oxtail fries. He does, we thought, then we go sit and wait very excitedly to finally taste what we've seen in pictures. A lady hands us our order and we leave. It wasn't until we got home that we realized that what we actually got was chili cheese fries, not oxtail. My 6'4\" 320 lb husband who loves food took about 4 bites and refused to eat the rest. $11 worth of fries down the drain! On top of that, he kept saying the taste was nasty and tasted burnt to him. He refuses to give then another try. Oh well, I tried."}
{"text":"Went to Bachi Burger on a Saturday to eat lunch with my nine-year-old son we ordered one Burger to truffle fries it took them almost 45 minutes to make a burger and french fries plus we had a 35-minute wait for seating then the Burger came to our table black and charred I told him this is a burger place you can't get a burger right she said we can make you another one I said I have to wait 45 minutes no thanks they took their burned Burger back and told me they won't charge me for it but they do have to charge me for the Truffle fries that I waited two and a half hours for I pay them for their fries and I told him I'll never return here  , fuku Burger is amazing never done me spring Mountain and Jones"}
{"text":"Burgers here are awesome! Super different. Asian infused. So, think beef patty with slaw, over easy egg, and unagi sauce. Really good. A little pricey, but fresh. About $13-$14 per burger. Doesn't include fries. Not a fan of their ramen, but their burgers are worth going back to!"}
{"text":"Oh, My. God.  Not sure what location we did go since we are not that familiar with Vegas, and a friend drove us, however, I have to say I really loved the place.  We had to wait like 40 minutes or maybe less to be seated (on a weekday for late lunch) but the wait was well worth it.  Don't you love when that happens?  I ordered the Bah Mi burger and the Morimoto sake Rogue beer, that is kinda hard to find.  I can have that meal all the time for the rest of my life.  With the mini donuts for dessert.  The fries were good I just cannot remember which one we ordered.

Can you please please please open a location in San Diego?"}
{"text":"Food here was delicious but our server Diana was exceptional! She made us feel so comfortable! Her hospitality made the food extra enjoyable. Props to Diana, a definite asset to the Bachi Burger company! Aloha!"}
{"text":"I had suggested Bachi to a co-worker before I tried it because I mistakenly assumed that this place, as its namesake suggests, sells only  beef-based burgers.  After he went 3 times in a week, filling me with stories of a crabcake burger that blew him away... well, I had to see for myself.  

My girl and I met for lunch and both ordered the Crabcake Burger.  Based on the reviews, I asked her to meet me early... but then got lost trying to find this place since it's sort of tucked into the back of a random strip mall on Windmill.  It was almost exactly noon when I walked in and, while there were certainly people in the resto, it wasn't packed the way I was expecting it to be.  

Service was quick and efficient and... when the Crabcake Burger came out... the angels sang.  It was wholesome deliciousness that I hoped wouldn't end.  The crabcake was slightly spicy and had a hint of asian flavor... and the battered, fried onion ring perched on the cake was just the right touch.  

Loved Bachi and am looking forward to going back.  Also, for those vegetarians among us, there are options for you too!! While I didn't sample, there are soy veggie burgers on this menu that sounded delish!"}
{"text":"I used to be an avid bachi fan. Between when they first opened on windmill to the struggle that is the Sahara location I finally made it here. This one is the worst location by far. Nothing we ordered was good. The fries had no salt and were soggy with a gloop of black truffle instead of being drizzled. No Parmesan as well. 

I ordered the Kiki burger. There was two mushrooms and it was missing the cheese. 

My sister ordered a cyo with cheddar and lettuce. It came out just like that. I guess it wasn't to basic to mess up lol. 

The service was sluggish and felt like we were a burden being 3 or 7 people currently being served. No water refills or napkins were offered to us. 

If you want the real bachi experience I do recommend the windmill location. They have been the most consistent. It should be great food, the service was always slow. But the food should be great. I'd skip this location though."}
{"text":"Admittedly being a newbie to fancy schmancy fusion burger spots Bachi really blew my mind.  It was packed but we got seated in less than 10 minutes.  The service was very friendly and the place looks cool.  As far as the burgers, they were a knock out for me!  

I had the Bahn Mi.  It was a straight out phó style burger with pickled carrot, veggies, jalapeno and fresh lush basil.  You dip this one in sweet phó sauce.  Very good.  4/5

There was the KiKi which had mushrooms bacon and looked good.  This was lil'bro's so I didn't try it.

The best one was the Miyagi burger.  With fried onions, fried egg a chimichuri/dijon sauce and a wagyu burger.  My it was a masterpiece of a burger. 5/5

The Truffle Fries had a Vietnamese type of truffle peanut butter drizzle and a straight garlic truffle drizzle between.  With a special aioli. It could only be better with actual truffle specks. 4.5/5

All the burgers were on a bun similar to a larger soft sticky bun.  Service and food make this worthy of 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Can't argue about the quality of the food at Bachi but come on folks, $32 for a couple of burgers and fries? Probably would be more receptive to the pricing if the place at least had a little ambiance but really nothing but concrete floors and bare wooden tables. Don't expect we'll return."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying the bill for my wife, son and I was $48.13, which is quite expensive for lunch! That's two burgers and fries and a kids burger and milk shake. We asked for our burgers to be \"medium well.\" My burger came out medium rare at best and my wife's came out just short of raw. We aren't the type to send food back to a kitchen as I have worked in the service industry. I will say that my burger was delicious and I ate the entire thing. When our server came back I told him he should tell the kitchen they need to cook their burgers a bit longer and he asked to show my wife's plate to the kitchen. When he came back he said the kitchen agreed that it was \"a bit under medium.\" Now folks...this wasn't a bit under medium. My burger was more than a bit under medium, I should have taken a picture of the burger so you could see how much raw meat there was that she didn't eat. 

When I am paying nearly $50 for burgers and fries at lunch before tip, I would expect my food to be near perfect and if it's not for the restaurant to make it right. They fell far short in a number of areas and at that price I will not be back. Your apology doesn't make up for the food that we could eat. Needless to say, we won't be back..."}
{"text":"What can I say about these burgers that hasn't already been said??? Yummo!!! Ono!!! Awesome!!! Grindz!!! Broke da mouth!!!! All of these apply. Everything that we ordered was mouth-watering and finger-licking good. 

The oxtail-chili-cheese-fries were delicious, I could actually taste the oxtail! There were big chunks of meat, not just shredded.  Parmesan-truffle fries are an absolute must!!!! The burgers were cooked to order, and weren't overcooked at all. My plantation iced tea was very refreshing and a perfect compliment to the meal.

You should definitely try this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Loved the Asian flavored burgers and can't wait to go back to try more. Had a ginger soda which was also delicious. Service was a little slow but otherwise great."}
{"text":"This review is for the wait. 1 server on a Friday night? You guys must be dumb! WTF!!! There are empty tables yet the line to be seated is out the door! Lets just hope the food here is as good as the original location! Get your shit together!!

worst place ever! Seriously the worst place ever! Worst place ever! Did I mention that this is the worst place ever?!?!? Omg! I'm so hungry ... Our waitress is too busy making milk shakes instead of grabbing our food. Wtf! Please just let me grab my food in the kitchen and I'll serve myself!!!

I feel like I'm on an episode of like a reality kitchen show where the food takes forever ...."}
{"text":"So we tried Bachi Burger finally, and I have to say that the burgers are tasty, but a little over-priced for what it is.  The buns are delectable, and the meat definitely is a higher grade of meat, but overall the a-la-carte pricing makes you wonder about your pocket book compared to other burger joints.

Definitely a great idea made off of the Asian fusion with burgers though. 

It probably doesn't help that the to-go isn't packaged as nicely as say... Chilis and thus you feel that the to-go crowd doesn't get quite the same service as those inside the restaurant.

You'll run about $15 a person or so without drinks.

Burgers are $7-15, and if you want fries, another $3-6.   My suggestion?  Always get medium to medium rare. The well-done wasn't done all the way through (some pink) and it looked like they charred some of the outside which meant the heat was too great to cook the insides before the outside burned.

Don't get me wrong, it's great food, but getting it to-go found a less than heartening experience considering."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Food was delicious!! And all of the staff was very friendly and fast, from when we got there to when we left. I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Ronin burger and wanted medium rare.  Waiter says chef recommends medium.  I say OK Medium it is.  The burger comes well done and dried up.  Egg was overcooked.  No flavor, extremely bland

Chili chicken appetizer wasn't bad, but the chicken itself was dry.  Also extremely expensive for the amount of food you get.

Prices are pretty high for \"local vegas standards\".  I use to live in Vegas, and paying $10-$12 for a burger (without sides) is pretty expensive.  I can get a $12 customizable burger loaded with toppings and sauces (The Counter), or an F.O. burger in LA for the same price....I don't expect to pay this in the boondocks of Vegas/Summerlin

What I liked:  Variety, serves beer, parmesan fries

What I didn't like:  blandness of food, slow service/poor, overpriced"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten! The Miyagi burger and truffle fries are a MUST! Everything about this burger is absolute perfection. When I go to Bachi Burger I know it will taste amazing, but somehow that first bite still blows me away every time. The wait for a table is usually long and it usually takes a pretty long time to actually get your food, but it's worth it, I promise."}
{"text":"Ok, let's see what the hype is all about!  I had been hearing so much about this place for a long time.  We decided to check it out.  I had to see what all the yelps were saying and what I could gather is that the wait is pretty long to sit down.  I figured that I heard so many good things about the burgers so it was worth the chance of a wait.  You walk into the the narrow restaurant find some big comfy couches in the front.  I thought, great there has to be a wait if they have these couches.  So we put our name and sat down with my 2 year old grabing Las Vegas Weekly and Seven magazines and piling them on the couch.  We didn't really wait that long and were seated pretty fast.  
We sat down and now the next hurdle.  What do we order?  I didn't know where to begin. I scanned the menu and the only word that stuck out was \"Kimchi.\"  I had to order the Kimchi burger.  My wife ordered a regular angus burger.  We ordered fries with the variety of fries.  I think we got my daughter a grilled cheese.  
when the food came it was awesome.  The burger had many flavors.  Try to go early if have a large group because when we were eating a large group was waiting for some time.  Bachi burger is in its own class.  I recommend! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Dear Bachi Burger,

I cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to have your savory burgers in my mouth.  I would love to try your Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Banh Mi Burger, Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and The Crusty Crab.  So basically the entire menu....

I wasn't able to experience the feel of the restaurant since I was sitting in the hotel room aching with tremendous pain, but luckily my best friend (Erica) and her boyfriend (Son) brought back the Pork Belly Steamed Buns as well as the Kalbi Burger.  That initial bite into the Kalbi Burger helped temporarily alleviate the sharp feeling in my leg.  And let me tell you, nothing could really get my mind off of it, so that means a lot.  What I loved about this burger was that it came with a side of Korean-styled, spicy red-pepper cucumbers also known as oh ee ji (Korean) or liang ban huang gua (Chinese) which is my absolute favorite Korean side dish of all time.  Their menu has Bachi Pickles but I'm unaware if they are referring to the cucumbers as described above. On the inside, the Kalbi Burger is light pink with juices oozing after each bite.  It has a thin crispy, brown layer from the sweet kalbi marinade and has kimchi, ko chu jang mayo, and green onions for added flavor.  Wasn't able to get a snapshot of the burger since it disappeared before I could get my camera.  Yeah, it was that good.  Love Korean food?  You'll love the Kalbi Burger.

Bachi Burgers' Pork Belly Steamed Buns were equally delicious!  These Vietnamese-inspired pork buns consisted of pork belly, hoisin, scallions, cilantro, Chinese black vinaigrette, and a boiled egg (which was excluded in our order).  I just remember the pork fat melting while the soft puffiness of the buns filled my mouth with the saltiness of the hoisin and the distinct taste of cilantro.  Bachi Burger is known for their creative Asian fusion burgers, but this wasn't necessarily the first time I've had something like the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  Can't remember where else I've had this dish, but its still a must-have especially if you would like order it as an appetizer and share with other people since they are bite-sized and comes in an order of three.

Thank you to both Son and Erica for introducing me to Bachi Burger, my new favorite, creative burger joint of all time.

{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating a meal here on at least six occasions. The Diet Coke flavor is delicious. I like their sweet potato fries as well. Everything on the menu is high quality and tastes good. The burgers, however, are simply spectacular. I recommend to all."}
{"text":"EDIT: The manager of Bachi Burger contacted me with his concerns, and since I've had both HORRIBLE experiences with backlash for negative reviews, and decent ones, I MUST add this to my review: ***Because of how professionally it was handled and how polite the message was, if I was back in this area, I would likely give this place another try and just order different things. Management with excellent customer service skills? Good job.

Wow... I can't express the disappointment that myself and my friends experienced at this place. It should also be stated that I KNEW I was walking into a fusion restaurant, and I was expecting a different take on burgers - but I wasn't expecting a sugar rush or an upset too-much-sweets stomach from a burger for lunch.

We arrived for lunch, having driven quite a ways away from the strip (which is FINE if you want to drive; we didn't mind at the time. But if you're looking for a good burger and you're visiting Las Vegas, staying on the strip? Just eat somewhere down there, really), and we were starving. This place busy, but not full; having said that, it took quite a bit of time to get seated in comparison to other restaurants that were just as busy during our trip, and yet seated us sooner. When we were seated, it then took quite a while for someone to pay attention to us long enough to take our order - they seemed very impatient and annoyed with questions about the menu, or any of the three of us being indecisive. They were very much non-engaging, as well, if that makes sense - it didn't feel as though they gave a hoot whatsoever that we were there, spending our money at their business.

The items that we all settled on:
Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns - These were the only thing I really liked about the meal. They were a new, interesting version of steamed buns; since I'm in LOVE with steamed buns and any form of dim sum, I liked the different take on this dish.

Spicy Miso Burger

Black and Green Burger

Kiki's Burger - this is what I ordered. I can honestly say that, along with the other people at my table, all I remember was how OVER POWERINGLY SWEET THIS THING WAS. Seriously. Sure, it was juicy and tender meat, but you couldn't even taste the meat itself because it was drenched in whatever marinade/sauce they use. For being told this was THE place to go for excellent burgers, I must say... not so excellent, unless you want a sugar high and have no interest in the burger itself. HOWEVER, the burger buns were divine and fluffy. Very nice touch, but would have been a nicer touch on a burger worth eating. If their quality of meat is sooooo great and wonderful, then they shouldn't hose them down with so much sauce that they kill the flavor of such \"quality\" meat.

Truffle Parmesan Fries - these were so unimpressive. It tasted like they took powdered brown mushroom gravy out of a packet, is the comment my partner said. On top of that, the overly sweetened mush burgers were enough food to have just skipped the fries altogether.

Taro boba was bland, I've definitely had better for a lesser price; my partner remarked that the thai tea was kind of dull, too.

We had a few other things, but I don't recall EVERYTHING that was on our table... none of it was good enough to really remember, except for the neat steamed \"buns\" and how fluffy the burger buns were.

In the end, our incredibly disappointing experience came out to $70-ish, and it should have been under $50 for what we felt we got out of it. The whole place seemed pretentious and snooty, especially for a restaurant specializing in burgers. The attitude (or lack of one, since they hardly cared to pay attention to us) of the service, the ridiculous marinade/sauced burger patties, and the overall disappointment is NOT worth recommending this place to others - at least, not from my point of view.

To top it all off, we had reservations at a restaurant that night that we were all very excited for, but within 20 minutes of leaving, two out of three stomachs were so soured from the sugar burgers that we had to cancel our dinner plans, and actually just return to our hotel rooms for a nap!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now since moving back to town. Had the Ronin Burger.... Best burger I've ever had!!!!!! Had the Veggie burger on the second visit and it was the best veggie burger I've ever had!!! These peeps are now my go-to burger joint in LV!"}
{"text":"This place is located about 10-15 minutes off the strip, so it can be a bit inconvenient, especially since I hate driving when I'm in Vegas.

Parking wasn't difficult to find since the lot is pretty big. It may be difficult to find a spot close to the restaurant though.

The wait was about an hour long. My friends couldn't wait so they went to Subway to grab some food before eating lunch.

I thought that the truffle fries were amazing, probably my favorite! I ordered the Ronin burger. The yuzu sauce created a good balance for the burger, but at the same time, I didn't think that they complemented that well.

I think that this place is just average. I wouldn't come back here if I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying that I LOVE cheeseburgers.  What we learned here is that I don't love the fashion burgers they make here.  or the sauce they put on my sweet potatoes fries... 
I think they are good for what they try to be but this isn't the place to go for a burger; it's about the experience of a food-gasmic orchestration of flavors in a bun.  I'll stick to Five Guys or In-n-out...."}
{"text":"Well, after nearly  2 years we decided to give Bachi Burger another chance(yes, I hold grudges). 

I'm quite sure this opinion is not going to be terribly popular and I will definitely be in the minority, but I just wasn't all that impressed. 

Allow me to explain. 

We were thinking it wouldn't be that busy at 2:30 on a Monday, but that was way off base. This place was slammed! A far cry from my last experience, we were warmly greeted by the hostess almost instantly! Already off to a better start! We were quoted 3 minutes for the bar, but after 5 we were escorted to a table! Nice!

We got our waters right  away and went through the menu. After a few moments our waiter came by and took our orders. I opted for the Ronin burger ($12), while my friend tried the Miso burger($11.50) and we decided to split an order of the parmesan truffle fries($5.50).

Now it did take about 15-20 minutes to get our food, but since they were so busy, it was understandable. The service here was like night and day from last time! Our drinks were refilled without having to ask anyone. The hostess, the waiter, and every other employee was very friendly despite it being pretty busy. 

Well, the food finally arrives and...well..it was ...okay. I mean, I just wasn't blown away like all these other people apparently were. I'm not saying it's bad. Actually it's not at all. I just don't think it's for me. My ronin burger was sweet, the patty was nice and juicy, but there was too much BBQ sauce on it , which made it pretty messy. I don't know. I just wasn't feeling it. Not only that, I had to go home and make myself a sandwich as the meal here just wasn't very filling at all.

The truffle fries were very yummy and very tasty! We did thoroughly enjoy those! They are served with a side of honey mustard, I believe.

I am glad that I was finally able to experience the famed Bachi Burger, but honestly, I just wasn't impressed enough to warrant a return visit. The service was good, but I just think I can get a much better burger at a much better price point here in town.



3 stars."}
{"text":"Best burger in town. Perfectly cooked through with amazing and interesting flavors. Would highly recommend this place to anyone in town."}
{"text":"We were staying on the strip, as most people do when they come to Vegas, and we took a little bit of a drive to get to this place because my boyfriends sister wanted it. She said she has to have it every time she's in Vegas, it's that good. At first I thought it was silly, especially with so many great places to eat on the strip, however after taking a bite into my enormous burger, I wanted to eat the whole thing, even thought it was so big I knew it was impossible! Defiantly worth the drive, I now will be joining her here on all trips to Vegas :)

We got the French fries egg (plus whatever toppings it comes with) appetizer and each got a different burger, all were equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried the bahn mi burger and it was excellent and cooked to perfection.  Had to come the next day to try the Ronin and liked this one just as much. What are you waiting for? Doesn't get any better than this for burger lovers."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews and it was mentioned in one of the weekly magazines here so I had been wanting to try it out for a while.  I got the ronin and my friend got the kiki we also got the truffle fries.  While we were waiting for that we ordered a jasmin lemonade and one of there home made sodas.  I didn't like the lemonade but i loved the soda.  The server was very nice and the  decor is pretty.  The burgers were ok.  I think I expected more since there are soooo many great reviews.  The burgers were well made but forgetable.  We didnt like the truffle fries that much either but we liked the burger buns.  If I'm in the neighborhood I will give it another try and order something different."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.  It has become a place to go when I'm in Vegas.  The first time there I had the Miyagi-san.  It's a messy, salty burger with all kinds of stuff - egg, onion rings, bacon.  It is oooh so tasty.
I had the Lonely Bird on my next visit.  That's their poultry burger (as if you couldn't figure that one out).  It's very good as well.
I've tried a few of their different fries as well.  My favorite is their Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries.  I'm glad my server informed me that their are jalapenos in it even though I did not see that listed on their menu.  It made want it even more.  And more I shall have on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely ridiculous, there was not enough workers. The food was extremely poor quality and tasted horrible. We walked in to a huge line, no host to even greet us and take our name. The host themselves couldn't read their own paper and didn't know the names to call when calling for tables. They claimed to have called our name, but it was never called and two parties ended up sitting before us. The food was poor quality and noodles weren't cooked, no egg came in the soup even though we were told it did. We ordered a beer and chili sauce that never came. We had to go track someone down for water and the bill. When asked if we could split the bill with cash and the rest on card they said no because the card had to be swiped first. We then told them to split the bill between two cards and the waitress came back and said that she only swiped one card, without even asking. I wouldn't recommend Bachi Burger. I've heard good things and the group that I was with, went in the past and said that the food and the service has done a complete 180."}
{"text":"I've been here twice... the first time I would've given it 5 stars, but the second time deserved 2 stars, so I went with an average of 3.  The food was DELICIOUS both times, but the service the second time was absolutely terrible. 

First, about the food. Oh. My. Gosh. It is cooked perfectly. I'm not even a burger person, and I ordered the mushroom burger both times. My mouth waters just thinking about it. The sweet potato fries and truffle parm fries will also get your mouth watering. 

First time I visited the service was spectacular. The second time, it took 20 minutes for the server to welcome us and take our drink order... from there it got worse and worse. The waitress got our order wrong, then never checked on us (I needed a side of ranch!) and the icing on top was that she billed us for another table's food PLUS ours. It was frustrating. 

3 stars for this joint. Know you'll get good food, but only a 50/50 chance of getting good service."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But the service is getting worse and worse every time we visit. Just tonight we came to eat here and left speechless. The server named Bianca told us to wait when there were empty tables. She was rude and showed such attitude when we asked to sit in tables instead of the bar. There are 3-4 empty small tables and that is why we dont get what her problem is. When we finally got seated, my bf went to restroom to wash his hands. I was waiting to order. My bf's experience with the restroom was horrendous. Dirty, no soap, no paper towel. When he got back I was still waiting to order. There were 4-5 servers walking around without helping anyone. I should mention that there was no one coming to even offer us a glass of water. Needless to say we left feeling terrible. We love bachi burgers and every time we decide to come we think of how delicious our burgers are gonna be. But the service put us off every time. I'm sorry but I dont think i will step foot in here anymore because the service sucks. I hope the owners would come and check this place out cuz i think the employees ruined the good name you built for your place."}
{"text":"Came at 8:20pm, there are lots of empty tables that haven't  been cleaned up. We, party of 2, were told to wait a few minutes for them to clean up and we would be seated shortly. We waited happily. We have good experience with bachi burger before (the one in Windmill) so we have no problem with the wait. 5 mins later, a server carried some drinks to the table next to where I sat waiting spilt her drinks all over. Didn't splash me. But we can see the unprofessionalism. Here we continued to wait, thinking the place is still new, They still need time for improvement. 20 mins later, we were still waiting. I should repeat: there are lots of empty tables but still no one bothered to clean up or make sure we got seated. My bf stood up and saw if he could catch anyones attention to ask what was going on. Still, the servers seemed too busy. I guess we didn't worth their time. Feeling upset, we left. We should come to the old location. Thought we could give it a shot. I guess we will never come back here."}
{"text":"I think this was my favorite location, because it wasn't as small as the other one, and service came around a little bit more, despite the fact that there were only a few employees.

Everything tasted great, big portions as usual, and made us have massive afternoon food coma.

Huge parking area also makes it much easier than the other location.

Decent on your wallet, what are you waiting for?!  Go!"}
{"text":"While the food was good. It did not live up to the hype. A single Kids meal Is $11.50 (which the server negated to mention) The oxtail fries had a slight sweetness to them and were served in plenty. The burger was ok but not worth the $12 tag. And the service was severely lacking. We felt almost a burden to the staff. And we are not a demanding group!!! All in all it's worth a try (I guess) but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Last week I wanted to visit my bf for lunch. First I went to try and find Curbside Cafe, but they wouldn't answer their damn phone. After spending about 30 minutes trying to find them I was really pressed on time. Since my bf loves burgers, the only place I could think of was Bachi since it's next to his work. 

We previously had a bad experience here due to the fact that they were slow as molasses, but I decided to give it another shot since I was out of options. I came in and ordered to go. The cashier said my order (2 burgers, 2 fries) will be out in 15 minutes and to my surprise it was! That was a huge difference compared to our hour wait when we dined in last time. The burgers and fries seemed to taste better too. 

Bachi now has my attention. I just hope they don't eff up the next time I dine in!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is slow and the hostesses are not friendly. Don't go during Mon - Fri lunch time.  It is packed and you will have a long wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Bachi !  The food is always on point. Hubby always gets a burger and I always get the Bachi fish. This sandwich is so amazing. I would never have ever ordered it on my own (cod doesn't excite me, as I'm filipina and enjoy more \"interesting\" fish than just fish stick fish), but I went with a friend and tried a bite. I was sold ever since.  I either get the Bachi fish or the duck buns. 

A locally owned, small business bakery (Lelysee) does the buns and they are outstanding!


I like this location so much better than the Sahara location, but service is always very slow (worse at Sahara). But, I would rather go to eat great food with mediocre/bad service than vice versa!!"}
{"text":"Love the location on Russell x Rainbow!  It's not as crazy busy as the other two locations, so the service is better (we usually have to dedicate 2 hours to Bachi if we really want it because of the wait and the super slow service at the other locations).  Food is phenomenal like the other locations.  They updated their menu and there are these spicy mustard wings on the appetizer list.  I'm glad my husband ordered them because I don't like mustard and would never have thought to order them, but those things were insane!  I want to go back just for those!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food: pretty good
Price: a tad overpriced
Service: nice enough
Behind the scenes/ management: terrible! We waited +45 mins for 1 burger & a kids meal. Our server was clearly overwhelmed bc we had to request the same items over & over. We ordered appetizer fries & didn't get them. At the end of over an hour ordeal, we had to wait another 20 mins b/c \"only one register was working & they're backed up.\" They def need to work out some kinks.

The food isn't so amazing that I'd pay or wait so long again."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Town!    Hands down!  5 star best you can get.  If you havent had a bachi burger, you havent EVER had a Burger.  Fusion Asian and Burger, prime cuts that sizzle and light up your mouth upon entry.   This is the explosion in your mouth you are looking for in food.  lol.   This is fusion as its meant to be, surprising and tasty with a new combination and flavors you weren't expecting.    I recommend the kalbi, ronin or the bachi burger, they will be the beggining of a new love affair with burgers and fries..the fries are insane!   $8-10 burger, that delivers.  5 Star stuff here, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE..locals, if you haven't been here.  Beat it on down the Line, ASAP!    5 Star Recoomended!   Real deal legit shizzy here kiddies...  Get some!"}
{"text":"Take out is a 15 minute made to order wait but so worth it!!!

Love this place kalbi burger and Roni burger today plus salt and pepper garlic fries mmmmmmm.  Mmmmmm. Good    Chef deserves a kiss mwah!!

Quick service menu i

Been meaning to try this I'll let ya know shortly how good it is - Well the report is in, and I have been twice now and I tell you what, best burgers in town.  Very Exotic and fresh, made to order, salt and pepper fries are insane, order one per person, kinda small.  Burgers are NOT small, just right, and so very perfect.   I recommend anything on the menu, I have had a few items and the are amazing.  Matcha Green Tea Banana Shake and all Shakes are off the richter, Myagi-San burger, amazing!  All the burgers are crazy good, pick one you wont go wrong.  Beef is fresh and juicy, fried to perfection.    Its a great burger for $12 with fries, $15 with drink for one, but its the best deal in town.    Bravo!  Try it, you will wont be sorry, if you like BEEF and FLAVOR!    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite burger place in town. I usually go to the other location but this one was good. The service was good. The food is as tasty as I remember. 

It's portions/price taste and service hit all the marks. 

I typically have to limit my eating throughout the day to properly enjoy this place. Many times I will only go if I have someone to go halvsies with. I've been to a few burger places that charge you $3 for fries and bring you a pretty wimpy portion but bachi doesn't disappoint there either. They have several kinds and you should take note of the type of ketchup or dip yours comes with because you might prefer one over the other. I typically do with the regular, but ppl I've been with love the truffle and sweet potato variety as well. I've had the oxtail several times. They're with trying once but they're not a must have in my opinion. 

My favorite burgers are the $12 ones. Miso and kalbi are the ones I clearly remember but I've tried a couple others. Two things 1) doneness - don't go beyond medium well (I personally don't go beyond medium), it's not as flavorful when it loses too much pink 2)less is more - a lot of their burgers have a lot of ingredients but sometimes too much stuff gets in the way rather than compliments. I recommend going with the simpler options. 

Note: I've never tried the waygu cuz I don't think my palette is that discerning."}
{"text":"I've been to three different Bachi Burger locations now. My first being here in Las Vegas, second back home in Los Angeles and third here in Las Vegas again. Not a single time have I had a bad experience and the food is great.

As usual I ordered up some appetizers and tackled a burger I haven't tried yet. The chili n garlic fried chicken wings were awesome. Not too moist with the chili and perfectly crispy. The bone marrow with oxtail was some of the best I've had in a while and no words to describe the deliciousness of the oxtail chili cheese fries...this dish is always a must during a Bachi visit. 

Last up was the spicy miso burger. This burger was more on the savory side in comparison to other burgers I've tried here. This isn't a bad thing because the burger was great. Still by far the Miyagi-San is my favorite burger here.

I see breakfast is served now so can't wait to pay a morning visit. Great food!

Dinner 12/6/2015"}
{"text":"The oxtail fries were amazing! Had the Miyagi-san burger. Wasn't too impressed. I think the lack of vegetables made it taste rich and heavy. My cousin got the Ronin burger and liked it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Im not really a burger person... So when my hubby wants to go try this place, I was dragging my feet. However, their bachi fish burger is so light and favorable, I'm so glad I decided to accompany my hubby. They use cod, second best fish in my book (sea bass is always my first choice). The bun is so soft and the toppings are very fresh. My hubby got the pork belly bun. It was a little to fatty for me, but my husband loved it. It comes in a steamed Asian white bun, the favor is very similar as peking duck. 

Overally we loved this place. Definitely will come back next time we are n town."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor to LV & was there for the July 4th weekend. I've been wanting to try Bachi Burger after having it on my bookmark list for sometime...

I went there with my family for dinner (around 6:30 PM) & we had to wait for about 30 minutes. The small waiting area was packed, but the restaurant area still had some empty tables. Another couple commented about the empty tables, but the greeter said something to the effect that they didn't want to overload the kitchen and have a backlog of orders...not a good 1st impression.

However, once we were seated I found our waiter to be friendly & attentive. We ordered the following burgers: Mr. Ho's Burger, Miyagi-San's Wagyu Grass-fed Burger, Kiki's Burger & Black & Green Burger. My daughter ordered the Bachi Fish sandwich. We also ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries & the Bachi Pickles for appetizers.The fries were good, but not \"out of this world\" good...The Bachi pickles were a variety of sliced Japanese pickles, such as takuan, radish, etc. something you definitely have to have an acquired taste for... We all enjoyed our burgers, it was a different experience (positive) with the Asian fusion taste. My daughter said the Bachi Fish Sandwich was good too.

Everything was definitely pricier, but if you're looking for a different twist/experience  on eating a hamburger, I recommend giving Bachi Burger a try. Service was acceptable & the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. This particular restaurant is located at a nice location in the Village Square Shopping Center in the Summerlin area which is about 30 minutes west of the strip (movie theaters are located in this center as well :)"}
{"text":"Woah.. the Kiki Wagyu Angus Beef Burger with sauteed shiitake and enoki mushrooms, caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, etc. was absolutely phenomenal! At a medium rare, the burger was oozing with flavor. Extremely happy with the burger especially after climbing a mountain.

There are a lot of beverages here including beer, hard cider, wine, sake, cocktails, milk teas, and tea. For some reason I went for a sangria AND matcha green tea. The sangria was tasty and pretty stiff. The tea though was a bit watered down, but you do get unlimited refills of this. After that scrumptious burger, I did opt for the Portuguese donuts with coffee gelato for dessert. The donuts themselves weren't anything special and a bit dry and I wasn't a fan of the 'gelato' since I didn't think the it paired very well. Still that mixture of hot and cold is hard to pass up.

Bachi Burger is very unique to Vegas only, so it's a must stop if you're from out-of-town. I sense that the locals think it's whatever, but for what it's worth, I thought the burgers certainly were one of a kind!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and was definitely satisfied!
We were seated promptly and attended to. The place seemed busy. Very small but cozy place. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries. I was a bit skeptical at first, but definitely surprised on how amazingly flavorful it was. 
We had a late breakfast, so we weren't able to try any of the burgers or ramen. But we will definitely be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"One common thing about good restaurants is that they get better each time you go. That's how I feel about Bachi Burger. Personally, I'm the type of person that likes to sit down, take my time, and enjoy my meal, and this trip to Bachi Burger was even more enjoyable because of the music they play in the restaurant. There's just something so perfect about having a great meal with great company, and good music in the background. Their Burgers and Steamed Sandwiches are all great and you can't go wrong with Truffle Parmesan Fries."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California, and even though they have locations there, I still enjoy coming to the original location. Burgers are fantastic. The pork belly slides are awesome and the oxtail chili cries are to die for."}
{"text":"Ok so I caved. Due to heavy holiday eating, I've been forcing daily hard core workouts and have been eating very light and boring. But dang it, I just really wanted a good burger. I'll make up for it. Jillian Michaels is gonna kick my butt but it was worth it. 

We were in for a tasty treat. We started out with the Bachi pickle plate. Consisted of a variety of pickled veggies. Not something we'd normally order but it was tasty, fun and a nice start for the palate. Eye appeal. 
I had the Kiki's burger and hubby had the Miyagi-San. Both medium. Both delicious, cooked to perfection and loaded with flavor. I didn't need the side sauce. I dipped some of mine in hubby's burger drippings lol. Holy cow. So good. I could only eat half of mine. We split the Salt & Pepper fries topped with fresh jalapeños and cilantro. And I think shredded ginger maybe? Tasty and salty. Dipping sauce was good, but again, I almost didn't need it. Finished off the salty meal with a salted caramel shake topped with roasted marshmallow. Wow. I could only have a few sips. We decided we'll be splitting a burger next time since we want to try the oxtail fries and the 'seasonal warm bread pudding' with butter cream ice cream (or something like that) and bourbon sauce. Hope the bread pudding is still there by the time we come back. Yeah we'll be back .. after several hard workouts and a bit of lean, clean eating that's for sure. I also want to try the Caesar salad and a few other things that stood out on the menu. 

Service was perfect. Cool waiter. Not over the top, yet attentive. Nice atmosphere. Pleasant experience with good energy. Great location. Easy to get in and out. Went right around 6:00. Wasn't overly crowded but wasn't dead. It was nice to go to a new place outside of Summerlin with comfortable vibes:) Also nice to have a delicious gourmet burger off of the strip."}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service, almost like it is a social experiment to see if they can give horrible service because the burgers are so good.  

Bachi has unique and delicious burgers, but the service at this location is consistently terrible. I walked in with my wife and they tried to seat us ahead of some others who had been waiting. When we did get seated, we spent at least 10 minutes waiting to be greeted, menus clearly to to the side. Waiters just kept walking by, no recognition. We eventually walked out, and on our way out saw the larger party that had been ahead of us, still waiting to be seated, just staring at the table that they were told would be ready and in fact was. I do think Bachi was understaffed, but that's no excuse for no greeting. Usually I'm of the opinion that you go to restaurants for the food, not the service, but when there is literally no service, there can be no food. Try the other location.

As to our prior visits, the service has consistently been terrible. This location severely needs training in terms of service and, possibly, to hire more staff."}
{"text":"Bachi has out done themselves. The combination of burger and ramen was genius. We were able to fulfill both craving at the same place. Thank you Ratha your service was great. As always the food was awesome."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times and it seems like the food quality and service has started to decline.  I guess they are too big now to keep the quality, too bad."}
{"text":"Monday night we went to Bachi Burger. We were so excited because the menu looked so fun, but our visit was so disappointing. We had seven people with us and spent roughly $130 and every order was messed up. 

Our order wasn't super complicated, 4 people ordered the bison burgers with different levels of done-ness. My brother wanted his rare and with lettuce instead of bacon. 2 of us the KiKi burger, both well done and my daughter had ordered a well done cheese burger. 

When the food came no one got their burgers cooked the way they wanted. My brothers burger had bacon, no lettuce and was very well done. My mom had to ask twice for them to bring him lettuce. Once after the waiter started tending to another table and he rolled his eyes when asked. Only one person got refills on their drink and it was once. The burgers had such potential but wasn't as flavorful as we were expecting. The bison burger has Brie cheese on it, but it was literally the size of a 50 cent piece in the middle so you only got a bite or two with it. 

The women's restroom was disgusting. Pee every where. Literally. 

Honestly we won't be going to Bachi Burgers ever again. I wish we had gone with our second choice."}
{"text":"This review is based on a group impression. Half of our eight liked this place, half were not impressed. However, the service was very good, and I will personally vouch for the chicken wing appetizers. In my opinion, probably some of the best out there; the burgers are good, the salads are fresh and the fries hot and nicely salted. I do not recommend the oxtail chili cheese fries. Good, but pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"All my friends raved about this place so I had to try it.  I came hungry after going to the driving range, so that says a lot considering I only give a so-so review.

I'm not big into these fancy burger places first off.  I've been to Burger Bar and I didn't find it worth the $16 and I kinda feel the same about this place.

My burger was good, don't get me wrong, but I've had tastier burgers for cheaper.  obviously locally, i will use the taste and price of In-N-Out as a baseline anywhere I go. 

Everything was prepared correctly, bun was tasty, but it just didn't \"wow\" me as much as I thought it would.  I will give this place another try, only because so many of you Yelpers love it so much!"}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE Burger place ,off the strip.
The Asian-Fusion style that the chef has created are so filled with flavor!
But don't worry, you can have classics if you prefer.

We always bring people here because it is fun, lively and delicious!
A few tips.- The Pork Belly buns may not seem like an obvious choice in a burger place, but they are amazing! The The Miyagi-San burger- OMG. The garlic-truffle edamame. Yes, just do it!

Love this place!"}
{"text":"In the never-ending Burger wars here in Las Vegas, Bachi Burger continues to be one of the best for me!

They have an Asian Fusion thing going on that is amazing! Don't worry...you traditionalists can still get a basic cheese burger...and it will be amazing too!

A few highlights - the fries are really interesting. I like the the S&P Garlic Fries, and my partner likes the truffle fries with drizzle. Check them out. Also the Pork Belly buns are awesome too! They make a great starter!"}
{"text":"OMG- SO EXCITED that one of my FAVORITE burger places opened right near my office!! We go to the Summerlin location all the time!

Seriously, if you have never enjoyed a Bachi Burger - look up any of the locations. You will not be disappointed.

The Miya-San is my favorite!
And the fries! So hard to decide between the sweet potato or the truffle, or even S&P with jalapeños! - YUM!"}
{"text":"People go for the food but return for the service.  I will not be returning.  Not only was my experience disappointing, when i found a hair in my food, the owner, yes owner who was on site literally accused me of putting my hair in my food to get a free meal.  Get real!!!"}
{"text":"Wow the waitress who picked up the phone her name starts with V is absolutely rude! Good places could instantly suck with one person who doesn't know how to communicate. Sad"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places in town. First off, the oxtail chili cheese fries. Normally, I'm not a fan of chili, but I would eat a bowl of this stuff any day. It's not overloaded with cayenne or chili powder like some chilis, but is perfectly balanced. Smoky from the spices, rich from the oxtail and a creaminess from the fried egg on top. Put that on top of their crispy, fresh from the fryer French fries and you've got the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! 
Second, again, fries. This time, the Parmesan truffle fries. The sauce is a mushroom purée of sorts with truffle, and lots of shredded Parmesan. It comes with a sun dried tomato aioli, but I prefer the truffle sauce poured over the top. Delicious. 
And finally, the burger. This is the best burger in town. Now, I'm a simple person, not into anything complicated on my burger. I get the custom, the Angus with bacon and cheddar. Sounds pretty basic, right? Wrong. We'll start with the bun. They bake their buns in-house, a sweet, light, almost Hawaiian bun taste to them. They come out crispy and buttery, slowly absorbing the juices from the bacon and burger, and simply wonderful. Now, the bacon. Somehow, they've managed to make bacon even better. It's applewood smoked and caramelized, giving it that extra depth of flavor. A sweet and smoky taste in addition to the typical salty, porky flavor of bacon. Finally, we come to the burger. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked a beautiful medium, perfect grill marks. It's a masterpiece of a beef patty. I can't give this place enough praise. Everything I've tried there has been delicious, but the three listed are easily my favorite. If I could, I'd eat there every week. Five stars. Ten out of ten. A+"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Seriously, the mr miyagki burger was one of the best burgers ever. The pork belly buns are delicious. There were 3 small buns so definitely craving more. The milkshakes are worth the extra calories. The salted caramel toasted marshmallow was addicting! 

Only getting 4 stars due to poor, inattentive service :(. And that they ran out of the top seller burger (bahmi) within an hour of opening. They didn't tell us until we ordered it. Am disappointed we couldn't try it"}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service. You'll never see me in there again. I had to chase down waiter to get more water and napkins. He never came back to ask how our food was or if we needed anything. Keep treating customers like that and pretty soon you won't have any. Thumbs down Bachi Burger. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"The same burgers as the windmill location plus a few extras they kept from when this location was Bachi HLK I am here at 6pm and the restaurant is basically empty. I'm sure it will pick up as they have just re-opened"}
{"text":"This review is my 3rd time going to Bachi Burger, however I do not remember the last two experiences lol. We came around 11am and there was no wait, our server Jasmine was incredible! All in all, we ordered Steamed Buns with Pork Belly which were AMAZING, Shoyu Ramen which my friend said was great as well, and the Bison Burger! 

I had the Bison Burger, and this is why my rating is 4 stars. The Fig Jam included in the burger was too strong that I couldn't taste the Bison. The burger was cooked how i ordered it. and the fries were average and well seasoned."}
{"text":"OMG..This place is awesome! ! Ordered a banh mi burger, green tea, pork belly bun, and oxtail chilli cheese fries with egg on top.  I will definitely come back for more when I'm in Vegas.  Service,  quality, and presentation is awesome.."}
{"text":"Unique burgers with an Asian flair.  I love the concept, and they are delicious too!  They have a great selection of beers and they also have boba drinks as well.  I love the plantation iced tea, it's sweet tea with mint, really refreshing.  My husband got the Manga burger and it was really good.  It was like sushi on a burger with an egg on top!  Sounds weird, but it was good.  Prices are decent, but I would have given it 5 stars, but I hate burger joints that don't give fries with their burgers.  It just doesn't make sense to me!  But none the less, I will be back everytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've attempted to come to Bachi Burger the last 3x I've been to Vegas and I FINALLY got to try it this last trip! There's always a long wait and now I can see why. The hype was real. 

We started with oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries. Both made my stomach so happy. If that were the only things I got to try this trip I would've left completely satisfied. I'm pretty much a sucker for anything with a fried egg on top. The fries were crispy, the chili was tasty, and the sunny side egg just completed the dish. The truffle fries came with a brown sauce on top. I have not the slightest idea of what it was, but it sure added to my truffle fries experience.

Also on the list of things I ordered were pork belly steamed buns with the houses sauce on the side. The pork belly was crispy on the sides and had so much flavor! (I'm drooling again...) BF ordered the spicy miso burger medium. It was saucy and messy and just the way I like my burgers. My experience with burgers have always been... The messier they are the happier I am with it. 

They also own the ramen spot next door and you can order ramen if that's more your craving. I can't wait to come back for more oxtail fries."}
{"text":"It wouldn't have been too bad had our burgers come on time. We waited roughly over an hour for our food. Our server 'mark' didn't even come once to check up on our table...someone else had to get our bill. Mark obviously got $0 dollars. As good as the burger is, I'll be going somewhere else for my burger."}
{"text":"Very unique burgers off the strip. It's very ironic but I usually only come here after late gym sessions since they're open late lol. I am very mixed with this place, there's some items I really love and some items that I really hated.
I really love the different options and burger combinations but some of them I feel are seasoned weird and kind of a mish mash of flavor. For example, I really didn't enjoy the crusty crab, black & green, or kalbi burger but I seriously LOVED the kiki and ronin burger. All of them were cooked perfectly and looked beautiful but something about those first 3 burger's seasonings were a little off to me.
Their truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries are alright, both of them are extremely overused in almost all specialty burger restaurants, and they didn't make them in any different way, so nothing special but still tastes good.
Their boba was also the worst I've had, very grainy with hard tapioca pearls, however their red velvet drink is quite amazing! 
So as you can see, I'm very split, so three stars!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and had to try it. We came around 7:30 pm and there was not a wait. It's not a big place but has a bar. There was one waitress in the place taking orders and sitting people. So we ordered the banh mi burger, the wings, oxtail fries , a kids burger and the myshosho burger (not sure on the spelling). 
My banh mi burger was good but not sure if it was worth $13. The kid's burger included fries and three slices of apples for $12. That was not worth $12! 
My husband liked his burger only because it had an egg in it and he says it was good. 
Oxtail fries was good. Chicken wing was different. It had a sweet taste to it. 
I liked the good overall. Just not too crazy about the price."}
{"text":"Before when they first opened I was a huge fan of this place.. but now i'm wondering if the taste has slightly deteriorated with their jump in popularity??

Their burgers are definitely good.. if I could give 1/2 stars they'd definitely be a 3.5.. but i'll have to drop it to a 3 because you will be expecting more than what you get from the long wait and hype.

You probably won't go wrong with any of their burger choices.."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Best burgers ever! Super juicy and the fries are also amazing! It was me and my boyfriends first time there and were planning to come again..at least once every month or something. Service was awesome and the servers knew their stuff when it came to the taste, the look and everything. Trust me..go and check this place out! Oh and they serve more than burgers and fries if you guys wanna know."}
{"text":"This place was really good , the service great and the food omg delicious i recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is really busy yet awesome. Came here on Sunday night and was seated in 25 minutes. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: this thing can feed 4 people, maybe even 6. This thing was massive. However, I thought it was just an average dish. The oxtail was there, but the taste wasn't.maybe I'm wrong, but it was too salty for my liking.

Pork Buns: fatty and delicious! I don't think I even need their dipping sauce. The sauce that was in the bun was perfect. The pork was juicy and savory

Miyagi-san grassfed wagyu burger: the patty itself was very succulent. The whole burger was amazeballs. Furakake is naturally salty, but it wasn't overpowering in this dish. Like I said, amazeballs.

Overall, I would come back for the burgers and pork buns. Service was good. Just expect to wait around 20-30 minute wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot when we come to Vegas. I always order the same thing, the pork belly sandwich. Never disappointed.

Fries are not included with your order so make sure you order it. I got the truffle Parmesan fries. Not sure what the sauce is drizzled on top but it's good. I ate it all to myself.

They don't have much for kids. They only have a burger or grilled cheese. My kids are picky so I just got them an order of plain fries to share. They are 4 and 2 and they wanted more."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but the service is extremely slow. Had to go to the front counter and ask for the check."}
{"text":"This place is always on point! Burgers always great never had a bad burger here. Oxtail chili cheese fries are totally off the hook. Friendly staff, great selection of food not only burgers but salads ramen and good selection of out of the ordinary beers too. Definitely recommending this place!"}
{"text":"We always have a great experience here. The burgers are phenomenal!!! And their fries are to die for !!!"}
{"text":"My older brother put me up on this spot. My girlfriend and I were looking forward to hitting up the slider truck but spent way too long talking with our good friends over at Fruition! We wanted a decent meal before our trip back home to SD; so off to Bachi we were. 

It's a little off the strip but way worth the drive! We ordered the Ronin and the Kiki burger and just ONE order of the truffle fries. We both split our burgers so we could kind of have our own sampler plate. The Kiki was bomb, but the Ronin was better! Wanna know what was better than the Ronin? THEIR TRUFFLE FRIES! We had to order a second order they were so damn good! This is going to be a frequent stop for us on our many trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Let me first begin by saying I wanted to love Bachi Burger, but the food is not worth the wait.

When we walked in on Sunday afternoon they were busy and we had a five minute wait while they cleaned a table. When we sat down, our waiter brought us some water and didn't come back for another 10 minutes. 
 By the time our waiter came back almost everyone around us had their food and were almost finished. 
We ordered and waited another 35-40 minutes for food without anyone checking on us. We then noticed people who were seated after us received their food before us. 
We were hoping the food was going to be so yummy but it was disappointing. 
My boyfriend order chili fries and they were cold. Although Bachi has unique burger combos, they aren't the best burger ever. 
Of course we waited another 10 minutes after we were finished before any waiter came around so we could stop them for a check. 
If you're really hungry, want food fairly quickly or are on time crunch, don't come here."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is simply awesome!!!  The burgers are out of this world delicious!  Spicy Miso Burger is our favorite but the others I've tried have been equally as yummy!  We ALWAYS eat here when in Vegas.  Have also brought several clients here for business meetings, and everyone has loved it!

Yes, the burgers are more expensive then your average burger place, but worth every penny!

YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP!!!! THE BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!!!!!

I went to Bachi Burger last weekend and it was so amazing!! If you live in Vegas, or you're there for vacation and you're sober enough to drive off the strip for a little bit, then you have to come here!  It is a pretty small restaurant so I would suggest that you get there early or you will end up waiting for over an hour.

The food is the perfect mix of Asian and comforting deliciousness.  I would definitely recommend the chili cheese fries. They come with a fried egg on top of it!!! I mean come on! How could you not want that?? I also got the miyagi san burger.  I would recommend it if you like onion rings and fried eggs in your burger. 

I can say that there is absolutely nothing bad about this burger place and if you think there is then you're obviously a bad person."}
{"text":"I forgot to update this review after we ate. Anyways... here is my take. We be a long wait to get in, for what? The burgers were expensive and was expecting to have wow taste. I was disappointed. Not worth the price. In the other hand the ramen was great. Probably the best one ive had in vegas. Still my favorite ramen place is in los angeles....santouka ....unbeaten"}
{"text":"First time here and we were not disappointed. Excellent service and awesome food.  The oxtail chilli cheese fries was amazing."}
{"text":"So, this place is purely awesome and a must stop for me every time I'm in LV. The oxtail fries will blow your mind, the pork belly buns are revolutionary and the burgers are quite possibly the best I've had in town."}
{"text":"Followed the high reviews to this Asian fusion burger place wayyy off the strip. Its a little hidden, tucked away in strip mall but boy we were impressed! We came during the lunch rush on a Sunday so we had to wait about 15 minutes while reading through the menu. Our server Jasmine was awesome!! Super helpful and attentive. We ordered truffle parmesan fries, caesar salad, kiki's burger (MINE :D), miyagi's burger and just a plain ol' hamburger for my dad. We loved all of our burgers. The burgers were cooked so well, crispy edges but juicy in the middle. I was so into my own burger I didn't ask to try the other two :// My mom also ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was so refreshing for the heat! Will definitely take my friends here if I was ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I love this place I don't even know where to start I all ways go in without eating breakfast so I can fill up on the good stuff and omg there is so much to choose from the Thai tea is so good then I get the oxtail fries witch might I say are to die for  I all ways bring my friends in to they get different burgers so we can all share I love the burger buns talk about melt in your mouth And if you have kids mine get the BBQ burger and all ways clean there plate what more could I ask for its  such great food"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! Homemade bun so soft and somewhat like Hawaiian bread. Truffle fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers, especially the chili fries and sweet potato fries. The burgers were all right, but not quite worth the price.

The staff is friendly. Overall a good dining experience, but a little expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Going to be sticking with only ordering take out here from now on. Sat in for the first time and it was not a good experience. Miserable staff. Extremely slow service. Food is pretty decent though."}
{"text":"Awesome burger place!!

They have asian-fusion styled hamburgers. If you would like to try something interesting or in town to try something different. I would strongly recommend this place. If you are from Cali, it is comparable to Umami burger. 

Food: 4.5/5
Price: 3/5 (a bit overpriced)
Environment: 4/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. The service is also great once you're seated. I used to come here almost every Sunday funday for happy hour (cheap, delicious sangria). Every time though, awkward situation with the host/hostess situation. Perhaps they've fixed it by now.

I always ordered the mushroom patty burger (forget the name). Super delicious. Seriously, ground mushroom patty here is amazing. It's wicked. They have cheaper/smaller apps on happy hour menu, oxtail chili fries! Complete with an egg on top. My boyfriend and I could never stop eating these, even if it meant stuffing our bellies pre-burgers. If you like sangria, try both. I love the white, but red is great, too.

Like I said, our waitress is always great. My drink is never empty, and we rarely had the same girl. Odd part, as I also mentioned, is getting seated. There are tons of empty tables, but we'd wait 15 minutes to get seated. Every time. A few times, we'd wait so long the hostess would forget and seat someone who rolled in after us first, and we'd have to remind her we weren't waiting for pickup or just chilling there for the hell of it. Really awkward. So...not sure what's up...however, don't avoid this place because of it. I came back to eat, the situation before being seated is just like sitting in traffic to get here. You deal."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is a decent burger lounge. Modern decor, fairly warm colors makes it somewhat inviting. The service was fine, a little bit of wait occasionally. But otherwise very polite. 
I had the kalbi burger and a sapporo. The burger was cooked perfectly with a nice hot pink center.  The homemade kimchi was great as well. The buns were warm and really fluffy. Presentation was simple, just the burger on a white plate with a side of kimchi pickles. 
The burger tasted fine, but was not amazing. Fine price for what you got, but nothing special to remember. I might go back, but I probably won't get that burger again. Worth a try, but not sure about the repeat."}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet burger bar.

I just ate lunch there and am in a food coma.  I had the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries and a Dogfish Head 22oz My Antonia Pilsner.   Everything fit together perfectly.  The burger was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing.  The fries were crisp and covered in jalapenos and cilantro with hawaiin sea salt and had a chili dipping sauce that fit together perfectly.   The beer was the perfect accent to the meal as well.  You can always count on Dogfish head.  

Overall this place was great, service was great and I will highly reccomend to anyone looking for a great burger experience.   The prices I feel are good for what your getting.  My entire meal was $30 and change.   

Bachi Burger is not too be related at all with fast food, In & Out or anything of that nature.  When you come here you are getting the sushi of burgers.  Nothing is spared in the pursuit of perfection to get you to burger nirvana."}
{"text":"before you bite my head off, I gave it a 3 based on texture issues and that's a huge thing for me when it comes to food. Ambiance, service & flavor are a 4 but I couldn't get past the texture of the overall burger. Okay. Here we go. 

We wanted to try this place after returning from Los Angeles and eating an Umami burger. From some of the yelp reviews this place seems to be a rising star with the exception of the service. I'm happy to say that they took our reviews into account and service is great. Now for the review. 
I wanted a great burger, something different in town besides the usual burger joints. After reading about this place, despite service issues, I needed to try it for myself.  My husband and I headed down and we were seated as we approached the front counter. They need a \"please wait to be seated\" sign because the layout makes one assume that it's a place where you order at the counter. Anyway, we were seated by this adorable waitress and our drink orders were taken immediately. 
The menu is simple and unique from any other burger place here. We decided on chili fried chicken appetizer, 2 kiki burgers, one truffle fries and one garlic, and 1 honeydew boba shake. The appetizer was good but luke warm making me assume it sat at the window for a moment. The flavors were really good but the plate wasn't what I expected. It's small boneless nuggets, not wings like I assumed. Still tasted great. The fries and burgers didn't take more than ten minutes and were nicely plated. All the aoilis were great. I was hoping that the aoli was made to order but I think it was made in a large batch. Still it was good and the one served with the truffle fries was so good that we ordered another side of it. As everyone says, all seasoned dries need more seasoning because it's not penetrating the fries but sitting as a sprinkle on top after being put in the cones.   as for the burger, the flavors are right on but here's the kicker-the texture needs work. 
Here's what I mean. When you have the caramelized onions, soft greens, soft mushrooms and bacon and then the burger has a pate-like texture, it's slightly off putting. (see my cut open pic). I can see where some feel that the burger is too mushy, because it's texture is super soft rather than having that firmness that burgers have. Despite this, I enjoyed the flavor profile. Nicely done. For those who enjoy the meat flavor in their burgers, places like this aren't for you. This place is about turning other foods into burger form. 
I would eat here again but I hope they try to add more textures into their burger. Try a cheese twill instead of sliced cheese to give it a change from the mush and softness of the burger and toppings. Other than that I liked it. The honeydew boba was nice, too. 
You should give it a try for something unique. This place is about the experience, and you'll get a good one."}
{"text":"People are going to hang me for this, but infect like bachi burger wasn't as great as the front puts it up to be.  Maybe I'm one to expect more at a seated burger joint, but it didn't meet my expectations. The service was slow, the burger was okay but nothing I'd come back for again. The plus--two years ago I commented on the original location that the patty was the consistency of baby food and that is no longer the case. I was shocked to find that the wagyu patty is glazed in a sauce.  Why?  If I pay that much for a burger, I want to taste the meat.  The miyagi burger had tempura onions piled a few inches high under the bun, a fired egg, bacon, the glaze and their other sauce. It killed whatever taste I should have experienced from wagyu beef. 

I'll come back in another year or so and see what they come up with next. I guess I'm too much of a burger simpleton to truly appreciate the trendy thing they have going."}
{"text":"Always love this joint. I tried the $26 burger and LOVED IT. Service is always fantastic and the food is so darn yummy."}
{"text":"The waitress Carla was absolutely wonderful, didn't bug us too much but made sure we were taken care of. However the food was not as pleasant. We requested burgers to be well done but came out red. I might come her again, although it is unlikely."}
{"text":"First time here! Heard so much from my friends who've eaten there, this place did not disappoint me at all!! Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMYYYY!
So good, I went twice in one week.  I tried the Kiki's burger with the salt and pepper fries.  The burger was amazing and packed with flavor.  The fries had the perfect amount of crispy and zing.  The second time I tried the oxtail chili fries and green and blue burger. I actually liked the Kiki's better.  I was sceptic about the oxtail fries.. But again so tasty.  Not skimpy on the chili at all and the fried egg added so much flavor on top of flavor.  The strawberry lemonade was sweet with a touch of lemon.  The plantation tea was so refreshing.  The sizes were perfect and didn't worry about not having free refills.  We will visit again!!"}
{"text":"When feening a burger after long shopping at the Premium Outlet Malls this is the perfect place. This location even sells Ramens !! I came for the Burger but I ended up having Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Spicy Miso Ramen Soup. The Oxtail Fries are AMAZING!!! The soup on the other hand was a bit of a disappointment...the noodles were flavorless and the SOUP was very watery...So Lets Talk about Round 2 I ordered the Kiki Burger and it was AWESOME just like I remembered it at other locations! My Angus Burger was fresh, juicy and very flavorful!!! When it comes to this place I'll definitely stick to what I know!!!"}
{"text":"Recently made a visit here and took my cousins (who were first timers) to eat. Of course they were so surprised of how delicious the burgers, and I say so myself the food is outstanding there hasn't been a time I had a problem with my food, always perfect. Also our server Matt had great personality who made my cousins first visit very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food. However service is soooo slow. Ate there today,  a sunday at 1pm. Place is not even packed and waitress got our order and we never saw her again. Other people were just calling any other server they see for assistance. We needed water and other stuff but couldnt get service. It is a good restaurant but they need more servers. They were just running to get your order and then theyre gone. No food suggestions, no time to talk to customers and say\" hi hows the food do u need anything\" i dont think its the servers fault i just think they were too busy. I cant imagine when this place is full."}
{"text":"The food was hands down, superb. I didn't get the hype over the oxtail fries, tastes like any chili cheese fries to me, however, it was still very good. 
I got the Spicy Miso Burger, tasted amazing. It was moist and they used the miso flavor very well. 

The reason for the three stars is because my group of friends received terrible service. I don't recall our server's name, he never introduced himself. But this guy just did not seem like he wanted to be there. He couldn't recall any of the milkshake flavors (turns out they don't have a regular chocolate milkshake, and the server had to come back and tell us that, guess he didn't know that in the first place). He literally replied with \"chocolate peanuts butter, strawberry and something...I don't know.\" Well geez, don't you work there? 
He also forgot to add on the extra party that my friend ordered, and my friend decided to go without since it would've taken another 5-10 minutes to make. When it came to the check, I told him specifically what amounts is like split, he still got it wrong.
My group resorted to asking other servers around us if they had a regular milk tea (apparently they only have flavored...makes you wonder if it's all powder back there), and another server to grab ours so that we could ask for the check. All the other servers there seemed lovely and helpful, even the new guy, but ours was downright unpleasant. 

I'll probably eat here again...just to go!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I get the \"lonely bird\" it's amazing the garlic fries are also really good!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I was thrilled when I learned that Bachi opened a location near where we live. I have been to all three locations here in Las Vegas and by far I like this location the most. 

1. I am impressed by how they maintained the quality of the food across all branches - kudos to the chefs!
2.  It does not get as crowded as the one on Windmill and Bermuda. 
3. The interior is modern looking and well-lit compared to the other two locations. 

My favorite burger here is the Miyagi-san. I tried the other ones but I always come back to this one.  It's a juicy burger with crispy fried onion rings and fried egg with furikake seasoning. This one is just amazing. It's a perfect balance of crispy and savory flavors. The sweetness of the sauce is balanced out by the saltiness of the onion rings. Perfect marriage of food!

I also love that they have the blackberry cider here. This one is such a rare find. It used to be called Fox Barrel but now it's called Crispin. It's my favorite cider and this is the only restaurant I know that serves them. Also, you must order the truffle parmesan fries. It's perfect every time. 

The service at this branch can use some improvement. We dined here one time (Saturday for brunch) and we had to wait for our food for over an hour. We were later informed that someone in the kitchen was in training so the food took a little longer than usual. Our food still came out perfect so I had no complaint. 

Aside from that, I highly recommend this place if you're in a mood for something new to try."}
{"text":"burgers were ok. Had three burgers, three fries and three drinks and the bill was $53 plus tip. Kind of overpriced for a neighborhood burger joint. Had the truffle fries with special sauce, served maybe a teaspoon of sauce and when we asked for more we were told it was an extra charge of fifty cents. Never before been charged for extra sauce so I dont think we would be returning. They give you one teaspoon of sauce with the fries so you can \"purchase\" extra, which came full. go figure. Also ordered the sweet potatoe fries which were excellent but the citrus sauce literally tasted like bleech. When they asked how we liked everything I told them the sauce tasted funny and I couldn't eat it they said it must have been the strong asian citrus in the sauce however,, they still charged for the extra sauce which we needed to compensate for the disgusting sweet potatoe frie aiola sauce. won't be returning as I didnt feel it was a good value and to be honest the extra ketchup charge really irritated me. sorry thumbs down on this place and the extra charge for french fry sauce."}
{"text":"At diners, I usually order a burger with a fried egg on top. It's standard procedure.  At Bachi Burget I saw the Miyagi Wagyu and knew that one was the one for me. The burger has the fore mentioned fried egg, PLUS furikake carmelized bacon, chilli mayo and onion rings. Sounds amazing right? It wasssss. The bun was soft, the burger was juicy and flavorful. I also ordered truffle fries but I didn't want to put the burger down. I left full and satisfied.

Prices were reasonable and service was good. I heard the oxtail fries and the pork buns were delicious too, that will be reserved for my next trip.

Absolutely loved it... highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Burger I ever had was from Bachi Burger.  I got the Wagyu build it yourself burger, and it was fantastic.  I have never had such good meat in a burger before.  You know how sometimes you go to a burger place and you get a bacon cheese burger and the bacon flavor just disappears into the over all meatiness of the burger?   Here it was like you could taste each flavor note individually and together at the same time.  I don't know how they did that but it was amazing.

We also had the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries.  I thought they were great but a friend I was with is really a truffle snob and his comment was that the truffle flavor really comes out in the oil that they put on the fries.  

Another friend had the pork buns and commented on how amazing they were as well.  The Miyagi-San burger also came highly recommended in out group.  We finished up the dinner with the donuts which were like huge donut holes covered in cinnamon and sugar with some coffee ice cream on the side.  Again the entire meal was amazing.

The only draw back to the place is that it was recently on Diners Drive in and Dives and there was a bit of a wait because of that.  But they are certainly keeping the quality of the food up even though they are now busier than ever."}
{"text":"Great place! On a mini vacation and heard about this place. Those burgers are the best! A must try...
I want to come back tomorrow to try the ramen soup."}
{"text":"Being vegan, I am in no way a burger connoisseur, but I will say I really enjoyed this place. We came here before a movie and I was a tad bit hesitant. However, I did see that they had some veggies on their on line menu that sounded really good, so I was pretty excited. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night around 8pm. 

Our server was a little dry, but he was on point with filling drinks and patient with my complicated order. I ordered the meatless burger, no bun, bed of lettuce and no sauces (Made vegan). My boyfriend and two friends ordered their burgers and the oxtail fries. I opted for edamame (it was so good). The food came out pretty promptly and with no problems (I didn't have to send one thing back)! They loved the oxtail fries and their burgers! I really enjoyed my food as well. I would totally recommend my burger to any and all of my meat eating friends... The texture wasn't meaty (being vegan, I hate anything that mimics meat), but it was definitely a versatile dish that anyone could of enjoyed! 

Oh and they carry my favorite red zin! Seven deadly sins and at a fair price per glass considering it's price everywhere else. Our friends enjoyed the beer menu as well. We will all definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Bachi Burger. My burger was awesome and the fries....OMG, the best ever. How do you go wrong with truffle Parmesan fries, light and crispy. But sadly, the service was lacking. Our waiter forgot about us numerous times. And it was not because they were busy as we went earlier than usual and were one of three tables seated. But because of the waiter delays, by the time we left the place was packed. Dinner service was extremely slow and folks sat well after us had come and gone."}
{"text":"Updated Review. Not as good as it used to be. Would not recommend going out of your way to eat here. Shogun burger is still good, but not great."}
{"text":"It was an ok joint. Servers was polite and professional. The burger was alright. I love the truffle fries and spicy edamame."}
{"text":"i don't even know where to begin. 3 hours later i am still, happily, in a food coma. a turkey burger hangover.
After Jesse B.'s review with the awesome sweet potato fries, bachi burger has been on Dan T.'s and my list to eat. We lucked out and even convinced his parents to venture out and try this place with us. Melissa was our server tonight. She was very nice and helpful. went over everything with us and even told us a little background on bachi burger. We started with some chicken karaage, oxtail chili cheese fries (complete with a fried egg on top,) and edamame. out of all three i highly recommend the chicken karaage. so crispy and tasteful. and that sauce. i don't even know what it was but i was loving it. the oxtail chili cheese fries had jalapenos all over them, but they were not spicy whatsoever. more sweet actually. they were still good and i enjoyed them.
moving onto our actual meals i ordered the lonely bird burger protein style. a chicken and turkey patty combined? I'll take it! the pesto sauce on it was quite lovely and i won't deny that i wiped that little saucer clean of it. i tried a bite of Dan's cheeseburger with bacon and was quite pleased but i will stick with my lonely bird personally. we all shared sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries. my choice was to order the truffle parmesan and i wasn't TOO impressed with them for the mere fact that about only 6 or 7 fries actually had the truffle sauce on them. all the others were pretty basic but still good to dip in the sun dried tomato sauce. I'd go for the sweet potato fries over those. the sweet potato's were crispy and packed with sweet potato flavor. i didn't feel the need to dip those in any of the fancy sauces.
needless to say, after all that yummy food we were all too stuffed to order dessert. I will be back though to try some of those little donuts with some ice cream and maybe sneak in a coffee. I was pleased. thank you bachi burger for filling my little stomach and putting me in this food coma."}
{"text":"Overall it was great!

I've had ramen here before which I love. First time trying their burgers and I was impressed. Don't come when you're really hungry cause there's always a wait. Anywhere between 10-30 minutes. 

Don't get any of their boba drinks, Thai tea boba was pretty gross. Burgers are amazing and great size for the price though! I got the miyagi-san and it was so good! I also took a bite of the kimchi kalbi and that was good too. A little spicy but good.

I do recommend it for a different burger joint!"}
{"text":"So this place was highly recommended by coworker when visiting vegas. Arrived Tuesday evening around 8:30p and was told 30min wait so we agreed. Asked for menus while we waited and noticed the empty bar. Approached the host about sitting at bar and was told that they only had two servers and couldn't handle the capacity seating. Later we discovered there were actually more than two servers and empty tables in the very back. After ordering our drink menu the waiter forgot to bring our drinks and had to ask another waiter to please bring our drinks which they brought over within couple minutes after asking. 

As for the food, we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, Miyagi burger with onion rings, tonkotsu ramen, and banh-mi burger.  First off the oxtail fries has chili beans cheese garlic aioli and sunnyside egg on top. The chili beans seemed to overpowering over the rest of ingredients and tasted more of a chili fries dish. My Miyagi burger was ordered with med done but was dry and not that much flavor when compared to the Banh-mi burgers so not consistent. I suggest medium rare for more juicer flavorful burger. Banh-Mi burger was basically a Vietnamese fresh roll burger which seemed off.  And the tonkotsu ramen was okay. Thought the noodles seemed over cooked. Overall the quality of food and poor service didn't justify the higher prices paid. Vegas being the mecca of food, I know there are much better burger joints for less money."}
{"text":"I usually love Bachi Burger. I first turned my parents onto this place and now whenever I'm in town we try to go there. So I was super excited to learn that they opened one in Summerlin's Village shopping center!

Here's the thing, overall the food was good but the service was terrible. Our server (I think her name is Erica) was just rotten. From minute one she was miserable and started to make us feel bad for wanting to eat at this restaurant. Why????  She was training someone and I think he felt bad because he kept coming over separately to make sure we were ok. 

So for the food, we started with the garlic edamame which you can skip. They are sautéed instead of steamed and not that great and the garlic aftermath just ain't worth it for that one. My parents got the duck bao and said it wasn't great but they loved their Kiki burger. I got the lonely bird which was awesome as usual. The truffle fries were delicious as were their sweet potato fries, but I liked them better with a side of honey (just my personal preference). 

So if we decide to have Bachi burger again, I'll probably hope that we go back to the Henderson location instead for the better experience. And Erica, if you are reading this, I'm sorry for calling you out, but I hope you find a job that makes you happy, but Bachi burger just ain't it!

P.S. I can't wait for the one in west LA to open- so excited!"}
{"text":"if you're into flavor with a slight asian twist then this place is a must!, their oxtail chili cheese fries are a delicious mixture of sweet and chili spice along with their signature banh-mi burger that infuses lemongrass, pork pate and fresh herbs, ..oh  those pork belly steam buns are outrageously awesome!"}
{"text":"I really don't need to leave an awesome review since this place has plenty! However, man oh man was it freaken good! We decided to go on Sunday on our way home from LV and got right in at 11:30. By the time we were seated the place got packed. Come early else find yourself waiting in the heat! It's a tiny place so not a lot of elbow room. Our party of 10 ordered 3 different types of burgers and a few other popular entrees. I say... Whatever they do to that meat is magical! The bread is soft and delicious and the meat is marinaded perfectly. Pricey indeed but oh so worth it! Bachi burger please expand your business in San Diego. We would love to have you here."}
{"text":"Great burgers with Asian flavourings!  This is a fun place, great service, consistently good food!  You may have to wait for a table as it can get busy.  It also now is opened up to share with the ramen restaurant so you can get ramen as well as burgers if you like.  

Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Went for late lunch with the \"girls\" during NFR after reading about it on Thrillist.  Was greeted right away and given explanation of what and how to order.  All of our lunches were delicious.  The service was the best.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"When I visit family in Las Vegas, I have to eat at Bachi Burger at least once. Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat at off The Strip.

The Shogun Burger and Ronin Burger are my favorites and I usually get the sweet potato fries or truffle parmesan fries to go with them. I also like the pork belly steamed buns.

Each time I've been to this location with my huge family (there's usually at least 8+ in our party) the servers have been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best Burger EVER! I'm so glad my sister made us stop here on the way to from CA to Vegas! The whole table order their most popular burger, the 
Miyagi burger and garlic truffle fries. What a delicious combination! The burger and fries are good to share if you aren't starving. The juices from this burger is like no other. Definitely a go-to pit stop before or after Vegas.

From my experience the service was pretty good. Our waiter went out of the way to wish my friend and I a Happy Birthday, also. But I can understand why other people on this yelp page complain about service - - I got some nasty looks from other servers, but I'm not gonna let that take away from my own waiter and yummy food.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I finally made the trip up to Bachi today....after getting our food, we wondered why we waited so long.  I ordered the Black and Green burger, my wife had the Lonely Bird.  We split an order of the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries.  To say that the meal was decadent is an understatement.  Amazing taste, great combination of textures and flavors. The service was prompt and very friendly.  We are definately going back again....and soon."}
{"text":"Have been hearing good things about this place so naturally I had to try it! However sometimes we don't get around to much eating in Vegas ha.. On a recent trip we decided to do take out so we wouldn't waste any time! My gf and I split the Spicy Miso and Miyagi-San burgers. SO BOMB omggg. I can't remember exactly what's in both so look it up! I def liked the Miyagi-San burger better but both were good! A couple gf's got the Oxtail Fries.. also to die for! Chili and fried egg ahhh *salivates*.

They made our order quick too and there were 7 different phone orders! They didn't seem irritated bc man I would be lol. They have a bar inside. I wouldn't mind actually sitting down to eat there one day. Looks like they may happy hour too. Check it out! Two locations for your convenience ;)"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this spot!

Great food, great atmosphere! Although our last waiter didn't seem to thrilled about his bosses...

Nevertheless I have spent many afternoons an evenings here enjoying wonderful food and will continue to do so along with recommend this joint to everyone I know.

Get the black and green burger with oxtail fries. You're welcome."}
{"text":"MiYagi sans burger ! !!! If this burger doesn't change your life, you are already dead! Amazing... Life changing"}
{"text":"So it's been about 4 weeks since I was told that a manager would be contacting me regarding a call I made that day to complain about the unacceptable \"service\" they \"provided\" but I guess it's just how they do things.... Customer satisfaction isn't necessarily a goal. Went in waited for an hour for our table, no problem we'll hang by the bar, but not allowed to sit and order since our party if 4 was too big? Looked over the menu, sat, knew exactly what I wanted. Waited another 15 minutes then server acknowledged us after two other tables have sat. Put in our order right away. Waited for 45 minutes, everyone at the table got their food after the other two tables were almost done with their meal. My food finally comes put, other two tables are done and paid. Waited for the server to come back with my coffee or refill my water but that doesn't happen until I finished the burger. I guess they were roasting the beans right after they picked it in Vietnam. Definitely will not be back. Sucks because we usually bring our out of town guests there all the time. Wouldn't want my guests to think this is how local places operate. Will do In and Out next time, I'm sure they're willing to serve food at a reasonable time."}
{"text":"Its over priced burgers gourmet style. I would prefer pay for cheaper Fatty good food, Fuddruckers, oxtail in the cal hotel, any steak and eggs late night specials.   I thought the idea of Oxtail chili fries sounded interesting, but it was like the chili just overpowered the rest."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger never disappoints!  Went for some oxtail fries and also got the octopus pancakes...amazing!! I also had the Banh MI burger and it was delicious,  food arrived fast and I left super full,  it was great!"}
{"text":"I assumed that the manager/business owner would at the very minimum extend an invite to try this place out again and give it another try, but it doesn't look like that is happening.  Its important to see which businesses in the area truly care about their customer experience."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to Asian burger heaven!  With burgers that are high quality and entirely unique, and drinks that you'll remember (Jasmine Lemonade is a personal favorite), Bachi Burger is a can't-go-wrong place when you have a bit of money to spend.  Unfortunately the prices are bit high, so you probably won't want to eat there all the time, but with lots of specials and new things to try, there's always a reason to go back.

I don't know where these other people with bad reviews ate, but I've never had a problem with the service at all.  They're always very friendly and while they could be a bit more prompt, there's no complaint here!  

First timers should try the Truffle Parmesan Fries, Jasmine Lemonade, and the Kiki's Burger.  I recommend the Banh-Mi Burger, but it probably wouldn't be for everyone's palate."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love bachi burger! We have made it a tradition for the last three years to make this a mandatory stop on our way back home to SoCal from a Vegas trip. We have only been to this location and every time we have the best experience. The customer service is great and the food is top quality! We always put in at LEAST 2 orders of the pork belly steamed buns (bao). Yesterday, I tried the black garlic Tonkostu ramen. They have a separate ramen menu. Anyways, the ramen was amazing of course. We always leave happy and full whenever we come here. It's always a special treat that we look forward to. 

Check out the article my husband wrote on this amazing food establishment: http://www.gravegoodssociety.com/blog/sin-city-pleasure-bachi-burger-shoku-ramen"}
{"text":"Juicy Burgers and Huge until you squeeze down to eat...Fries and Guava milkshake sooooo good !!!"}
{"text":"As soon as we arrived in Vegas our first stop was the Bachi Burger.  We came on a Friday night and it was busy but we only waited a couple of minutes to be seated. The restaurant is spacious and casual.  In the front, there is a leather couch, a table with menus, and a small chalkboard listing their specials.

::Drinks::
I got the Iced Matcha Green Tea. It was not sweet and I couldn't taste the green tea flavor; it was watered down.

::Food::
We got the Black and Green Burger which came with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, sautéed mushrooms, bacon, spinach, blue cheese, and roasted garlic.  I also requested to add Fried Egg.  What I liked most about this burger was the bun, it was fluffy, toasted, and sweet.  Next is the KiKi's Burger.  It had Angus Beef, caramelized bacon, cheese, sweet onion marmalade, garlic chili aioli, and three kinds of mushroom, Shiitake, Enoki, and Eryngii.  I prefer this burger than the Black and Green Burger.  If I come back, I will try something different and I also want to get the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.

{"text":"Delicious food at reasonable prices. We loved every bite! We are here on a Friday and my fiancé asked to eat there on Saturday when he came to visit! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Black & Green burger was to DIE for! 
Wagyu grass fed beef was superb & tender. I ordered it Medium. Spinach, Blue cheese, mushrooms and bacon . 
I would order again but I'm looking forward to trying EVerything!

Ps: sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked. Best ever. 

Service was great, being our first time the waiter was patient and went over everything . 
Our drinks didn't come out right away and they apologized twice. I like when servers make you feel important even in a burger joint. Nice!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a burger girl, but this was the best burger I have had in forever.  If I had the chance I would be on the next plane to grab dinner tonight.  There were five of us for lunch and everything we tasted was delicious.  

I had the Miso Burger and even almost three weeks later I still have dreams about it.  The Patty was cooked perfectly and the flavor combination was terrific.  I actually split this burger and the Ronin burger with someone else and was sorry I did.  Not that the Ronin was great, just the Miso was that much better. 

The table had 2 Ronin burger, a regular burger (my husband likes everything plain and simple), Peking Duck Steamed Buns, and a Kiki Burger(they brought this by mistake but the boys all shared it and they loved it.  

We started with the Bachi Pickles, I liked them a lot no one else seemed to enjoy them as much.  The asian spin was a great twist.

We also had the Garlic Salt & Pepper French Fries and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Although an afterthought in my review definitely not an afterthought here. They stand up very nicely on their own.  Particularly the truffle one, we were battling it out for the last bite.

Service here was very attentive even if mistakes were made.  The staff was very friendly and quickly corrected any issues."}
{"text":"Oxtail fries were dressed with a chili soybean meat sauce. Burgers were angus beef. For the price I may not drive off the strip for the find but will definitely drop by if near by."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm mmmm...after waiting an entire year to eat this (bf tried it the year before and raved about it, and our next trip wasn't for another year!), it was very much worth the wait. Since we knew we probably wouldn't be back for another year, we went all out -- oxtail chili cheese fries and pork belly buns to share, and I went for the shogun burger since it has foie gras and it's banned in California.

Oxtail chili cheese fries were my fave of the meal - the perfect bite had a little bit of everything, plus a jalapeno to add some more spice. I would definitely get this every time - and I hope they have it on the CA menu when it opens!

Pork belly buns were good, but not the best I've had. Still really good though, and worth trying if you like 'em. A little oily, and you can't really taste the hard-boiled egg, but still yummy with the soft bao.

Now for the $26 shogun burger -- it came with a beef patty, unagi, and foie gras. That's a LOT of meat, and the menu actually shows it \"deconstructed\" and I ended up eating it kind of this way too, just because there was so much stuff going on. I liked the patty & foie gras together, and the roasted/grilled pear was a very nice complement to the heavier flavors. It's definitely a rich and filling burger though; I could barely eat half of it. So if you get this, you probably don't need anything else - or you should share it with someone else, along with apps. I wouldn't get it again, just because I can't finish it and it's expensive, but I'm very happy I got to try it and get some foie gras!

And just 'cause they were so good, I have to mention it again -- it's only a day later, and I'm already dreaming of those fries..."}
{"text":"The Kiki burger was delicious! High quality angus beef with a selection of three commonly utilized mushrooms in Asian culture, shiitake being among them. Savor garlic aioli and caramelized bacon beautifully balanced with sweet onion marmalade. Cooked to perfection, efficient service and a friend/family conducive ambience made for a wonderful culinary experience. And for only ~ $12/burger! 

Fries are high quality. Also, they have boba for you fanatics out there. Definitely a 4 star recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellent Kiki burger especially you like your food a bit sweet! Good for friends and families :)"}
{"text":"My sister-in-law was raving about Bachi Burger so for my last night in Vegas, we had dinner here with my brother. I felt pretty overwhelmed with the menu since everything sounds SO GOOD.  If I wasn't feeling broke, I totally would have ordered the Shogun Burger: Wagyu Beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and Yamamomo peach. ARE YOU FORREAL BACHI BURGER?? I had a foodgasm just reading that decadent description but when I saw that it was $25, I painfully had to choose another burger.

In the end, I went with the bahn mi burger since my sister-in-law read good reviews of this burger. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this since I love bahn mi sandwiches. 

According to the description, the bahn mi burger contained the following ingredients: Angus Beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass, pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, with pickled vegetables and Nuoc Mam Sauce on the side. If I didn't have read the description before chowing down, I wouldn't  have known the pate, pork or shrimp was in this burger. I think there were so many flavors going on that those got lost in the mix. I had my burger cooked to medium and my oh my it was so juicy! I also enjoyed the fresh herbs (aka mint and cilantro), pickled veggies the curry aioli. Those flavors when so well together! I personally thought the Nuoc Mam sauce (aka fish sauce) was unnecessary since there was a lot of other flavors going on. Overall I really enjoyed this burger.

The three of us split the truffle parmesean fries, which were very tasty by themselves. The black porchini creme sauce that was drizzled over it was just as tasty but I felt that the sun dried tomato aioli was unnecessary for dipping.

Despite what other reviews have mentioned, I though the service was fine. My sister-in-law was also surprised since she did mention service was slow at Batchi Burger. I guess we came in on a good night.

I highly recommend checking out this place. The Shogun Burger is on the top of my \"To-Do\" list when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Sangria was awesome!!!!!  It's full of fruit... Great light drink... The sake with the fruit is like a little taste of goodness..."}
{"text":"Damm this was a tasty fusion burger!  I was expecting Bachi to be overrated.  I read reviews about how it was over-priced but most of their burgers are $10 and for the quality and unique fusion of all of the fresh asian ingredients, it's great value.

I got the Ronin burger which came with caramlized onions, cole slaw, fried egg, a yuzu sauce, and the BUN.  If you're familiar with the buns they use for the chinese bbq (Cha Siu Bao), this is the bun.   Sweet, soft, and heavenly.  Now only if I were 10 years younger and they had these buns Fudrucker's size, I'd be going to town!

All the ingredients are in perfect harmony.   In addition I had the parmesean truffle fries and the famous oxtail chili cheese fries.  The chili was no the sweet side - I would prefer some more heat but still very delish.  Be sure to flip the egg to get that runny yolk all up in your fries with the garlic aioli.  

If you're looking for a different burger experience and don't wanna shell out $20+ for on the Vegas strip, come check out Bachi!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas hands down. I can't get enough of the black and green wagyu burger. My suggestion is add wagyu beef on any burger you order and make sure it's medium or rare. The quality of beef is what keeps me coming here. My favorite thing to add on burgers is foe gras, It's well cooked and the flavor is just the right amount of fatty and almost sweet. The line when busy is a hassle at times but the staff is helpful and great with menu questions. A great spot for great burgers."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is always a solid meal. Burgers cooked to the right temperature, a hip environment, and Asian twist. I'm Asian, so I feel the burgers are less of something completely new, but a visit to familiar favorites with a twist. It's so easy to marinate your burgers in teriyaki, lol. I like the sweet potato fries over the truffle ones, which were soggy. The pork belly bao were nice, but much less filling than a Kiki burger. The boba was frothy and less sweet than a typical bobo, which was a nice departure from the norm. But they have some classics on the menu -  including shrimp chips! YUM!"}
{"text":"Since I loved coming to Bachi so much the first time, I came back a 2nd time a week later, but they were closed for a private party.  Three days later, I made a return.  Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow, taking 35 minutes to get our food.  On top of this, the waitress did not come one time to check on us.  When we asked about getting our fries, they informed us that it was up to us to ask them to bring it out before our burgers if we wanted the fries first (even though they automatically brought us our fries first on our last visit).

We ordered the peking duck steamed buns, which were very good, but not as good as burgers.  We also ordered the sliders, to which they forgot to add the fried eggs we had wanted.  The waitress gave us a %10 discount for all these mistakes and the slowness of the service, but I left feeling very dissatisfied.

I can understand the wait if the restaurant was packed, but almost 40 minutes for food when the restaurant is less than half full is incomprehensible to me, especially when the waitress doesn't even come to check on you."}
{"text":"For starters, when we walked in at 10am, there were only two people at the bar. Nobody was dinning. The three of us ordered item's straight off the menu. They came back a few minutes after we ordered to say they were out of short ribs and suggested a steak. Then a few minutes later they didn't have roasted tomato for my omelette and suggested peppers instead. Why peppers? After around 35 minutes or more the food began to arrive. The smoked salmon latke looked great and taste good too. The steak burger which is what we replaced for the short ribs on the loco moco was rare in the middle. We ordered it medium. The omelette served was still waiting for the hash browns. I prompted the server to put the omelette in the hot window so it wouldn't get cold. So now two of us don't have food and the one meal we do have is not being eating out of curiosity. Now no manager ever visited our table. The server did say sorry, but more as a response, not like she even cared. So 50 minutes have past and we decided to leave. The concept they have could work. But they need somebody to manage the staff."}
{"text":"Miyagi son and oxtail chili cheese! get a kona coffe nightcap while your at it (adults only) or the cucumbe mojito and the Sangria are awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while, so when I had the chance to go whilst in Vegas for a short 22-hour stint, I made sure this place was on my list.

Oh, I am so glad we waited the 30 minutes or so to get in here. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, onion rings, a couple of Miyagi-San burgers and a Ronin.

I don't know about the Ronin, but my Miyagi-San was freaking delicious! And the oxtail fries were not a letdown. I cannot wait to go back.

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I wanted to order a drink from their menu that's behind the bar and the waitress told me that the menu was obsolete. Weird. Maybe that should be taken down?"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas for a girls weekend and my roommate suggested this wonderful restaurant before catching our flight back to Colorado. Everything we had was delicious! We had the fried chicken, oxtail chili fries, ramen, kalbi burger, and a few other things to share with a table of 4. 
The oxtail chili fries were surprisingly sweet but still had a good kick. The kalbi burger was bomb and I had to eat it the next day due to the ridiculous amount of food we ordered (still flipping delicious). 
The ramen was good but not out of his world. Good hearty portion that hit the spot. 

It was so delicious that I returned to Vegas 2 weeks later with my boyfriend and requested that we eat here. I ordered the miyagi burger this time and it was amazing and definitely a good sized burger. Highly recommend and will return the next time I'm in Vegas! We were exhausted and hungry after driving 11 hours and there was no line and we were seated promptly."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kiki burger and wow that was amazing. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas. The fries were amazing as well. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food they serve."}
{"text":"Omg the Miso burger is beyond delicious!! And the Parmesan fries!  I looove this place, I literally crave it every couple months and have to come.  They have more than burgers on the menu too so you not limited.  Staff is always friendly and well educated on the menu, they always answer all questions with ease and detail!"}
{"text":"Cool twist on burgers! Most of the specialty burgers have some Asian influence in the ingredients. We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries topped with a sunny side up egg that were off the hook but a tad bit on the salty side. Can't go wrong with all the ingredients but put together YUMM!

Ronin Wagyu burger: onions, Japanese cole slaw, fried egg and Katsu BBQ. Great burger with a Japanese twist and the buns seem like the bread used in a Chinese baked pork bun. 

Miyagi Wagyu burger: another burger with Japanese influence. Fried egg, furikake, bacon and onion rings. C'mon that sounds good right?

Both burgers have some sweetness due to the sauces they add so they are a little sweet and savory. Kinda reminds me of the Fathers Office burger joint in Santa Monica, Ca. Gotta try when you come to LV."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot after being dissatisfied the first time. This time I left with the same ripped off, grossed out feeling. I love gourmet burgers, but there's something about this place that grosses me out. I love all types of ethnic food, so it's not the Asian twist on the burgers I'm talking about. If you want a delicious gourmet style burger go to Gordon Ramsay Burgr in planet Hollywood. It's about the same price too!"}
{"text":"My friends took me to this off the strip burger establishment and i enjoyed it thoroughly.  How come the three stars?  It's because of the service unfortunately.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries; this is probably the only place that has this dish!! It was amazing; if you have not tried stewed oxtail this is the place to taste it; unfortunately when brought out the fries were lukewarm and the waiter said \"oh we forgot to cook it\" Who says that?!?!  Well they took the dish back in and heated it up in the oven and it still still turned out marvelous.  For my main course, I had the Banh Mi Burger which was a spin on the vietnamese sandwich.  The burger meat was cooked perfectly and it had two fish cakes with the vietnamese fish sauce.  It was great.  We also had fish chips (divine!), parmesan truffle fries, and salt and pepper fries.  Unfortunately the service did not match up to the food.  At one point they did not have enough cups to bring us our green tea beverages.  The service put a damper on the great food, but this can be improved.  Keep up the good work with the food! I would come here again though and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I so much want to give a higher rating for this place but truthfully the service was Horrible! We called ahead and was told there was NO wait, we arrived about 20 minutes later and waited almost 20 minutes even though there were empty tables. What made it worse, is that 2 other parties arrived after us & were still seated ahead of us. It wasn't until I told one waitress that we were willing to split our \"Massive Party\", which was only 6 by the way!!!
Only thing that saved the night were the Oxtail chili fries. I highly suggest ordering that plate, it makes it all worth it!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place BUT after going here prob 8 times in the last year, 6 of those times I waited five mins or more to get seated and the place was never full. There is always a prompt Welcome shouted out from an employee and then it's like you turn into an invisible person for 5 to 15 minutes until they get around to seating you. And when you get seated, you get to watch other people wait like you did with empty tables all around. Makes no sense. Always go there for dinner by the way. 

I walked out once, but the burgers are so solid it almost makes up for it. There is an awesome server, think his name is Paul, and most of the others are just ok to below ok. I've never had one Come back and ask if everything was ok. I think that's a standard practice of good servers. 

BUT. Those burgers though.... Ronin is my fav and the fish burger is to die for. Please bring the pickle appetizer. It was awesome. 

I think I would go here twice a month if the service was better. They always seem one person short and the bartender is a server and the host person all in one. I want to love you Bachi, but you need to dial in a few things first."}
{"text":"Forget the wait time. Forget about knowing burgers. You don't. 

One bite of the Miyagi Burger and I swear my mind goes crazy over this ridiculous burger! Whoever thought furikake and beef goes well deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. SERIOUSLY. Grassfed beef, crispy onion rings, OMG bacon,chili mayo and that fried egg combined with a toasty bun makes this place an automatic 5 stars. 

True to following Yelp, we ordered the Oxtail Fries and the Truffle Parmesan. Man, those fries are so good with and without the sauces, and while I preferred the classic tastes of the Truffle Parmesan, the hearty flavor combined with the delicious chili cheese makes the Oxtail a must get!

The Sake Sangria is not a bad choice for those who want to get their pre-buzz on but actually enjoy the burger and not collapse while eating it! A combination of Sake and Sangria works pretty well, and while I only had one, I think next time I'll try both styles and see which one is better!

There are so many reviews of this amazing place, and I believe if they continue to strive towards perfecting their burgers, they're unstoppable! You deserve the 5 stars Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Worth it! The Shogun burger is over the top.  I don't even want to know how many calories. The shrimp appetizer was fresh and tasty.  We also had the Ramen soup which rivals the ramen we have had around town.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"When I say Ricky is seriously the highlight of my entire week, I mean it. He was so friendly and accommodating from the moment we came into the restaurant! He suggested certain food items and they all turned out to be amazing. Quick side note: The Parmesan truffle fries were absolutely fantastic! I truly enjoyed this overall dining experience and will recommend to all my friends. Can't wait to go back and see Ricky :)"}
{"text":"been to all 3 locations. Had a bad experience at windmill. something was in my burger. fries are always great. the sauce is great. portions aren't too badminton the shakes are great during happy hour from 3 pm to 6 pm. great place to go when you want something different."}

{"text":"We came here tired of the usual eat-till-you-hate-yourself buffet that typically characterize Vegas trips but still looking for quality food. And we found Bachi Burger, the epitome of Asian-American fusion. What a gem to find in the middle of Vegas!

Faves:
- Organic Edamame. I got the garlic truffle ones, which got a little too garlicky after a while, so I'd probably get the normal salted ones next time.
- I ordered the Truffle Parmesan, but I ended up liking my roommate's Sweet Potato Fries more! The serving size is perfect for one person; so if you like your fries as much as I do, do NOT share/split haha. 
- Sure, the Ronin Burger is super popular, but I also recommend the Banh-Mi. How creative.
- Vegetarians! Many options for you. Plus, this is probably one of the only places on land that sells a real-life KRUSTY CRAB BURGER! haha. Plankton, eat yo heart out.

BE SURE to specify if you don't want kimchi on your burgers! It's an acquired taste, and the waiters definitely understand, haha. 

Drinks were surprisingly tasty here! The boba here was probably better than a lot of places back in LA. Get one.

Only thing that keeps it 4-star: service was mediocre. It took a long time to get seated (despite there being many empty tables), food took a long time, and it was hard to get the attention of the servers at times."}
{"text":"Came back for the second time, not like how I remembered it.  maybe it's just me, because everybody else loved it, came for lunch. No waiting.  always good in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this review b/c I really wanted to LOVE this place.  My friend recommended that I visit this place while visiting Vegas...so I went out of my way, ventured off the strip, and had the Miyagi'san.  It was just ok.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  But I've had better burgers...and I have paid less.  However, I understand that it was grass-fed beef and all, and that is why I had to pay so much for just one burger and an order of fries...but I've experienced better.  That is all."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and chilli fries!  And their homemade soda is excellent!  You must try!  We had to wait but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Forget the tourist food on the strip.  You will not be disappointed with Bachi. 

5 stars from the Foodsnob is very rare as everything has to be perfect from concept,  cleanliness, service and of course the food. 

Went with large enough party and got to sample a few different signature burgers - all were amazing.  Order the truffle Parmesan fries and a beer. Simply heaven."}
{"text":"BSET BURGERS WE EVER HAD!!! BAR NONE! tHE BLACK AND GREEN WAS EXCELLENT IF YOU LIKE BLUE CHEESE. tHE kiki WAS WHAT i ORDERED AND IT WAS VERY YUMMY BUT THE BLACK AND GREEN i LIKED MORE. We shared one order of sweet potato fries that were perfectly done. We made it a point to call the manager over to tell him just how much we loved our meal. GO and TRY"}
{"text":"This place really is the best, I've come here twice and there's always been a line but in both cases the wait was much shorter than expected. I've never waited more than 15 minutes here even though I was given 40+ minute wait times. Service is decent, food comes out inconsistently, we noticed tables after us got served before we did, etc. The food definitely makes up for everything bad that could ever happen here. You have to get the oxtail chili cheese fries, it is sweet and savory and the fries are so good. I would definitely recommend the Ronin and Kiki burgers. I've also tried the Miyagi-san and spicy miso burger - they don't stand out as much as the Ronin does. If you're feeling adventurous, upgrade to a wagyu patty, you can taste the difference. I love the food here and I make it a must-visit spot every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"this place was featured on tv show and i was not impressed at all. 1st-we waited almost 10 minutes to be seated, really?? the restaurant was not FULL at all... 2nd i ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries served no OXTAIL, chili tasted like canned chili which was a big downer:( i wanted to try the pork belly steamed buns...it was good, but nothing to salivate over... mom and sister ordered the burger with kimchee and burger was, again, NOTHING to brag about...needless to say, i wont be back to that spot again."}
{"text":"I have to say that although the burgers here have good flavor, Bachi Burger is not top on my list. I am one who enjoys a good burger and I've only tired 2 of the Burgers here. I will say that the beef they use has great flavor. The Chicken and Turkey burger that I tired however, just didn't sit well with me. It was way to over spiced. The burgers here are overpriced for what they are. The downer is that your burger doesn't even come with fries, you have to purchase them separately. Unfortunately, the order of fries was so small, that it was gone in no time between two people. I also ordered a large Sapporo and sadly it came in this small glass, but they sure charged me for a large. The atmosphere of this place was not to inviting either. Nothing to catch your eye, no music, no TV. The only thing that was worth looking at was a tall and handsome waiter that works there. Sad to say that I will most likely not come back to this place for a burger as they are overpriced and the atmosphere was not inviting."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Bachi Burger for a year now. The wife and I first heard of this place on our honeymoon. We didn't get a chance to try it out at the time. But the year long wait did not disappoint. She built her own Burger and was thoroughly impressed with both the flavor and visual appeal (loved the stack of onion rings. I had the pork buns and was extremely happy I did.
I had only two disappointments. First, our server seemed to be in a hurry to turn his table. I understand it may have been the \"lunch rush\", but when I tell you I have never been there, that's your cue to make a recommendation, not stand there gazing over the rest of the restaurant. 
Secondly, did you guys really need to charge us for two 1oz sides of sauce. My wife's burger was ordered without any kind of dressing so she could enjoy the chili aioli. That's just lame. 
Considering our whole experience, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's not a place to sit around for a long conversation just eat and get out. On Sunday's it's a long wait, and they don't take reservations , be considerate of others theres people waiting to grub as well. Don't just lounge like you have no place to be. 
Melissa our server she's friendly and quick with suggestions seeing that we were struggling to find something appropriate for my 4 year old and two year old. The meat patty flavorful and juicy but we didn't care for the burger bun it too soft like a texture of sweet Hawaiian rolls. All my 5 kids removed the buns and just ate the meat patties. We love the sweet potatoes fries with garlic and oxtail the flavor reminded me of chili fries"}
{"text":"Always a must stop for me when coming to vegas. The burgers have so much flavor and so juicy. The fries can hold their own as well. Cant go wrong with the truffle or the sweet potato. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is damn yummy. My bff sent me enticing food porn when she came here so I had to try it when I went to Vegas in April. I had the spicy miso burger and baby daddy had the Ronin. We ordered parmesean truffle fries to share and the Portugese donuts for the grand finale.  Can I just say that I literally drool thinking of these burgers. It was so yummy and not at all heavy. I ate the entire burger and I didn't sit there and go \"uuuuhhh..I'm so full..my tummy hurts!\"...nope...I just had that smile on my face and I was ready for the donuts to come with....and those little sweet fried balls of heaven were awesome...a perfect compliment to an awesome lunch. I wish I lived closer to Bachi Burger so I could try all the other delicious burger varieties but alas, I will have to wait till Vegas calls me."}
{"text":"Fun Asian fusion burgers off the beaten path of the Las Vegas Strip.

// FOOD // 
     + Oxtail Fries: Believe the hype. Gooey fries topped with tender bits of oxtail
     + Pork belly bun: Not NYC's Momofuku or Ippudo worthy, but a decent version. 
     + Kiki burger: Topped with a variety of different mushrooms and has a sweet finish with the sweet onions. The burgers look small, but are so thick, that you definitely get full. 
     + Miyagi-San: Onion rings and a fried egg? Heaven. 

*Tip: For you Southern Californian-ers, Bachi Burger is coming to Sawtelle on the westside!"}
{"text":"2 stars for executing the food. Everything else was disappointing. 

I won't bore yelpers with my entire experience. Although my waiter was friendly, the service was very poor. Just slow and not attentive. 

The food - I just don't agree with whoever put the menu together. There's too much going on in most of the items. When a place upcharges you for ingredients like wagyu, foie gras, truffle, you want them to shine, but bachi covers them up with a bunch of garlic, onion, sugar, sauces, etc.

My spicy miso burger had 0 amount of spice, and all I could taste was miso and sweet. The meat and egg were cooked nicely. The truffle parmesan fries were OK. They had parmesan, chives, truffle oil, and a mushroom sauce, and were served with another sauce on the side that didn't go with those flavors at all. 

Glad I tried it, but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The burgers are so so good here! One of my go-to spots when we have company in town. Oxtail fries are a must have! The staff is just ok. It almost feels like they are doing you a favor by serving you. Seriously, I have not had one kind server in the many many times we have been there. Just plan ahead for mediocre service and focus on he AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"Went on a evening to try their burgers. Saw on yelp and I think food network. That evening there were a lot of open tables but people waiting. Was told to wait but couldn't figure out why. They had a birthday party in the back section but that shouldn't stop them from seating their customers. Waited 25 minutes and ready to walk out but they finally seated us. 10 minutes went by before we got to order. A couple who walked in right after we were seated got there meal before us. Crappy customer service. The burgers were o.k. but with this kind of treatment I don't think i'll be back. Customer service is #1. What irked me more was the hostess and waiters where joking and not paying attention to their customers.  They just don't care."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Vegas, get off that trashy strip and check this place out. The most amazing, awesome, unique burgers you will ever have - anywhere!!! A year later and we are still talking about this place...it is pretty much the only thing I have ever really liked about Las Vegas. 

The miso burger is spectacular. Eggy, runny, spicy - I've never had anything like it. The pork belly buns are another DON'T MISS on the menu. The flavors at this place are something else. A definite oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Came here for the first time and ordered the Ronin Burger and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. Both were super delicious! The burger patty was very flavorful, tangy, had caramelized onions, pickled ginger and a fried egg...yummmm! The fries were crispy and savory too, also had a fried egg on top. Definitely coming back!!

Must-tries for next time: steamed buns, seasonal burgers, and Portuguese donuts! They have coffee, tea, and milkshakes as well."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a wonderful marriage of two things I really like, Asian food and burgers.  I had the BanhMi burger and really enjoyed the Vietnamese flair.  It was like they combined pork egg rolls and a burger in one meal.  They feature a decent selection of beers and the fries are rather fun and tasty.

What keeps me from giving Bachi Burger five stars is the crazy layout.  You enter the restaurant from what seems like the back, rather than the door closer to the main road.  This was rather confusing and at first had me thinking the restaurant was closed!"}
{"text":"I truly waned to like this place. We were in Vegas a few weeks ago to visit family and my husband recommended this establishment.  He happened to dine here with colleagues while on a business trip and he enjoyed the food.  I would like to explain why I gave them two stars.  Firstly, the wait was about an hour. There were no sufficient chairs available to sit inside the make shift lobby of the restaurant (it's pretty compact) so we ended up waiting inside the car while the car was running. Why? Well, it's summer and it is Vegas at above 110 degrees. Of course you need cool air! After an hour, we were seated and was waited on by a courteous server.  We ordered our drinks and he returned after 15 minutes to get our food orders.  Everyone in my family ordered burgers while I chose ramen.  The ramen came out after 20 minutes and we were told that the burgers will be coming out in 5 minutes. Well, 10, 20, 30 then 40 minutes went by and no burgers were in sight.  I finished my meal and my family haven't eaten yet. It was past 9:30 at this point. My Dad is diabetic and his blood sugar was low as he felt shaky.  He was not feeling well by the time their food arrived.  Shortly afterwards, we were handed the check/bill and my Dad has not even tried his burger!! How rude!!! I don't get it.  There's anything obviously something wrong with how this restaurant is managed and ran.  Tons of people running around by not enough people in the kitchen.  Needless to say, we left feeling swindled!  I do not recommend this place and definitely not going back.  Their only saving grace is the nice guy who served us. He was not the guy who gave us the check by the way."}
{"text":"When we arrived here in Vegas, we yelped for restaurants near us. This place was one of the restaurants listed.

The reviews were pretty good, but still I wasn't sure if the eastern western fusion of flavors would work. I felt more at ease with our wonderful server Theresa. She made a bunch of great recommendations to me and our Vegas party.

I ordered the Miyagi-San burger... it was delicious. The flavors and textures all worked well together.  An order of salt-pepper garlic fries and Thai ice tea completed my order. Dessert items looked tempting,  but I didn't want to get to \"hate myself level\" full, so I passed on dessert.

As for the wait, it took maybe 5-7 mins to get seated for a party of 5. I'd say we were there around 4pm or so.

I did try some ramen that someone in my party ordered... both the ramen and broth were very tasty. The pork was melt in your mouth tender and had a good amount of flavor.

Overall, good food, very clean, and friendly customer service.  When I come back to Vegas, this is a joint I wouldn't mind hitting up again."}
{"text":"Great fusion of flavors on the menu... Soo many burgers to choose from I must come back to try others.


Oxtail fries is quite the diggin'


Sweet potato fries to finish off the meal.


Sauces: Pineapple ketchup  :: 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"After learning that Wagyu is the American version of the Japanese Kobe Beef, we ordered the Oxtail Fries and the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger.  This Asian Fusion burger was great!  I am a sucker for fried eggs on burgers.  Tastes like a fru fru version of Smashburger.  Pretty pricey for a burger but a must try!  Oxtail fries had a tangy bbq taste and very filling.  I only ate 1/2 of the order since it is a large portion."}
{"text":"Holy sweet Jesus, this is some good cow.

They proudly display a sign that says \"Voted Best Gourmet Burger in Vegas 2010\"---and rightfully so.  Bachi Burger takes the classic \"meat, bun, & veggie combination,\" adds a bit of an Asian twist to it, sprinkles on some magic dust, and voila! What you have is a kickass burger waiting for you to devour it.

With every Vegas trip I go on, I've been more than glad to come back here. Service has always been amazing--almost as amazing are their Sweet Potato Fries. Semi sweet, super crispy, extra delicious. Get these instead of the gravy-topped Truffle Fries and you won't be disappointed.

It's not listed on their current menu, but last time I went, I had the pleasure of trying an appetizer dish...I believe it was Seared Tuna with Chips....it was utterly delicious. The salty chips paired nicely with the silky fish. The Ronin Burger, Kiki Burger, and Spicy Miso are always good choices as the main course.

Next time (if the blackjack tables treat me a little better,) I'll opt for the Shogun Burger!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, mostly after work so around 1am. I always have a good experience.

My first visit was marked with the Ronin burger with a fried egg. I'm a sucker for eggs and it was delicious. The truffle parmesan fries are great but the garlic truffle edamame is the best appetizer. 

All the burgers are solid and creative. But I regularly get the pork belly steamed buns or the duck steamed buns with fresh shrimp chips along with at least two glasses of the Apple Yuzu soda, that stuff is addicting!

I've also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries. Sounds good on paper but the ratio of soggy chili fries to normal fries was out of proportion. Too much chili and not enough oxtail. You wanna get a soggy fry, normal fry, chili, cheese and a piece of oxtail in every bite and that just wasnt possible. 

Desserts are forgettable, which is fine cuz I go there for the food. 

Wednesdays are industry nights for locals, I think this is a recent thing so take advantage while you can."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

We came for dinner on a Monday night and waited about 20 minutes. It took awhile for the server to come by and take our order. The restaurant was definitely understaffed. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, peking duck buns, and the miyagi burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries are overhyped; it looks better than it tastes. The peking duck buns were a bit bland, but the miyagi burger was AMAZING. Every bite was juicy and flavorful. The crispy onions in the burger also added a great crunch.  So definitely come here for the burgers."}
{"text":"We ordered the seasonal salad, pork buns, and wagyu burger lonely bird style. Pork buns came out first and the first bite was off putting. The steamed bun was dry and the pork was hard. I also did not care for the Chinese black vinaigrette. 

The tangerine salad dressing sounded refreshing but it ended up being too biter for the ingredients in the salad. The burger was the only skilled dish. Patty was flavorful and I enjoyed the soft bun.

After having been to Bachi Burger two times I think where they excel is in their burgers."}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian style burger I've ever had in my entire life
Had the spicy miso burger with grilled onions and bacon. As well as the Oxtail chili fries. 

Will defiantly return with a crowd next time!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan!! Went here last weekend and I must say the food here is pretty good!!! 

My bf and I shared the oxtail fries & the Shogun burger. The oxtail fries were really tasty!! You can kind of tell that the fries don't have the same flavor profile as regular chili cheese fries, but I wouldn't say that oxtail jumped out at me. Granted, these fries were pretty freaking good and I'd get them again...but the oxtail flavor doesn't sing. 

The Shogun burger ($26...pricey I know) comes with seared foie gras, asain pear, arugula, unagi (eel) and the angus beef patty. This burger was probably one of the BEST burgers I've ever had! The foie really put it over the edge for me. The foie was in-your-face delicious and the pear had enough acid to cut through the foie. I didn't really care for the unagi. I hardly tasted it at all so that was the only \"ehh\" part about it. But definitely one of the best burgers and if you're in a baller mood you should order it!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The oxtail fries is a must and the $26 Shogun Burger was worth every bite!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday [5.27] & heard about this place from my coworkers about a month earlier. It was a bit of a drive for me, but hey~ they're open until 1am! Definitely worth the drive because this place is going green & sell local art that they have as decor :) They also have a flat screen tv by one entrance & a lounge/couch area right by the restroom by the other entrance.

I wanted to try the mango or honeydew boba, but the server said that they were powdered flavors :/ I ended up getting the green milk tea with boba & that worked just fine.

I ordered Kiki's burger; sauteed shitake with mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili with aioli on the side. This burger was awesome~ everything about the description made it sound great, & it was! The buns for the burgers are sweet, definitely a good size portion because all of my buddies know that I'm a slow eater.

I ate half of the burger to save room for dessert; Portuguese donuts that had Vietnamese cinnamon & coffee gelato. This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9 

The service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server. I know she wasn't knowledgeable about some of the questions we had about the menu, but it's totally understandable because I know that they're training for success! This place is doing great so far & I know that they will open one soon on the southwest area! *nudge nudge :)"}
{"text":"Went again. This time for Mother's Day. I tried the Lonely Bird- a juicy ground chicken & turkey patty Tsukune-style (Japanese-style poultry meatball covered in a sweet soy marinade), lettuce, tomato & onion in between a buttered sweet bread bun smeared with a herb pesto. So delicious. I also had half of the Bachi Fish. Just as delicious as I remember. We also ordered a side of Truffle Parmesan fries which should have been more crispy. 

Service was okay. Thank goodness the amazing burgers made up for it or else I probably would have deducted a star. When we got there, we waited a few minutes before a server actually came and greeted us. It wasn't even packed when we went. We waited quite a while for our food to come out, and when it did, they forgot about our fries. In celebration of Mother's Day, Bachi Burger gave out a complimentary slice of guava coconut cake for all the mothers...except my mom? I did hear one of the servers saying to the table next to us that they were running out of cake, so maybe that was the reason. Oh well...it's the thought that counts, right?

Regardless, I'll be back again because I love the burgers here."}
{"text":"I frickin LOVE this place.  The first thing we ordered was the Bone Marrow Jam and it's this delicious bone Marrow with meat goodness jam and this amazing duck butter and a crunchy toasted bread pieces this is a must try.  I actually skipped the oxtail fries for this and apparently we are the first ones to be served this item from their new menu items.  We will definitely be back to this location from now on"}
{"text":"We ordered everything! And it was yummy! Calamari, oxtail fries, duck on steamed buns, 4 different burgers & salted caramel shake. We left satisfied and definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Oh wow - there are too many positive things to say. 
The food. Is. Amazing! 
The flavors - fusion compliment perfectly. I will be back when im back in Vegas. Its a must. 
Super easy to find - rent a car - few minutes from airport - worth the drive. 
Easy to park. But remember this is a very popular location by tourists and locals. Might be a wait for seating - but its worth waiting for. Top notch."}
{"text":"Good food but would prefer less roaches

\"The imminent health hazard closures begin at Bachi Burger on Windmill and Bermuda where the roaches are so comfortable that a health inspector held one in the palm of his hand.  \"

{"text":"Great burgers. Since Holstein's went down hill in quality, it's easier for me to give Bachi a solid 5 star rating.

Before I gave Holstein's a 5 star rating, and compared it to Bachi. But now Bachi is probably the only good burger joint in Vegas (that i know of)."}
{"text":"Literally out of almost the entire Ramen menu all the time. Unable to order of that menu the last 14 times I've gone there. I give up, done with this place. You can't offer anything off of the Ramen menu either make more stuff or remove the menu in it's entirety it's not brain surgery."}
{"text":"Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries 5/5
These fries were a ridiculous combo. Ive never had a broken egg on top of fries but this worked out very well. It didnt completely sog the fries as long as you at em fast enough. Ive usually had carne asada or pollo on top of fries so the oxtail meat was refreshing.

Truffle Parmesan Fries 5/5
This is easily one of the best truffle parmesan fries ive ever had. Generous servings with a good truffle aroma sprinkled with parmesan. the Chili dip was a good complement as well but you dont even have to use that for these fries to taste good

Ronin Burger 5/5
Im a sucker for onion rings or grilled onions on a burger so this was a easy choice for me. The katsu bbq sauce made the burger irresistable not to mention the meat was prepared well. I ordered the angus beef medium rare 

I highly recommended anyone in the area to come eat at this place!"}
{"text":"Food is really good here!  The truffle fries--amazing!  Would def eat here again!  The alcohol is eh, but the food makes up for that!"}
{"text":"Saw this on the FOOD network and figured I give it a shot.

It was as good as it was on TV.

The pork belly buns were really good as was the Mister Miyagi. Skip the $25 duck liver burger. It was good but it wasn't as nearly good as the other burgers that were half the price."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite burger joint in town. Only because of the asian influence on the food. It's amazing and service has always been excellent. They have a gourmet trained chef so the varitey of flavors keeps me coming back over and over. Featured on DDD. One of my have to go when I get out of towners."}
{"text":"We need one of these in New York. And there should be one closer to the strip. I didn't mind going out of our way to come here though, it was totally worth it. I wished that more people came with us so that we could have ordered a wider variety of food to try but there's always next year! 

We started with the duck baos, which were tender, juicy, and flavorful. We also got an order of truffle fries with spicy dipping sauce to share. For burgers I got the Kalbi burger, fiance got the Kiki, future-bro-in-law got the Shogun. I think the Kalbi was the best of the three. The Kiki was good but a little too sweet for a burger. 

Overall, we'll be back for sure, especially for the oxtail friese! See you again next year!"}
{"text":"Totally delish! Perfectly cooked, medium-rare \"Kiki's Burger\" -- which is angus beef, sautéed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, and garlic-chili aioli. I would have given 5 stars if I were only rating the burger.  However, I also got french fries. They were just not worthy of Bachi Burger.  Absolutely unremarkable wimpy skinny limp french fries. The dipping sauces were wonderful tho. I will go back many times for the burgers.  Maybe Bachi Burger will improve their fries and make it a 100% 5-star experience!"}
{"text":"Bachi is good stuff! You can custom build your burger, they have good and cold beer, and their truffle fries are simply amazing! In addition, their special mayonnaise taste original and fresh.

Tip: 

Order your burger well done if you like it medium;

Order it medium is you like it raw;

Order it extra well done if you like it well done.

As long as you know this secret to get your burger cooked the right way you should be good to go!

Like it so people can see this and get their burger cooked properly because this place is very good! Burger is fresh and yummy btw."}
{"text":"The service can sometimes be painful but the food makes it worth it. Oxtail fries, pork buns, ronin burger and the ramen are my favorites. Their sodas are also delicious too. They do take out as well which is convenient."}
{"text":"Great burger. I got the Wagyu burger with arugula and blue cheese and the oxtail chili fries. Both pretty delicious. The service was so so. She had the whole place to herself, but not too many people. She made me feel rushed and uncomfortable at times. Not sure why. A little awkward. As long as it wasn't like that every time I would go back. Prepare to spend a good amount of money for the burger. Wagyu or not."}
{"text":"This is a burger/asian-fusion joint. Lots of great options and things to try! They even had a few beers that were't on the menu (which were also great!).

My wife ordered the BBQ burger (which was fantastic) and for the life of me I can't remember the name of what I ordered, but it was a set of 4 small pork belly sandwiches. They were incredible. We also ordered a side of salt & pepper fries and were very impressed.

This place is a great place to go for a meal!"}
{"text":"We came here because of DDD and I'm so so glad we did! One of the best burgers ever! I ordered the Mr. Ho's burger medium well ( the waitress recommended it to us, thanks a bunch 4 that)  and it was like heaven! :0 the buns were a purple, bluish color and so soft and Delish, and it was full of yummy flavor l just cant... I also had the Tai tea with bobas, the sweet potato fries, and dumpling appetizers! All were A++ I'm definitely stopping by here to try some other items from the menu next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Forget any burger joint you ever been to; transcendental is my experience..my bill was $120 with drinks for three people, gtfoh, i've spent more on a date with me and my wife. OXTAIL CHILIE FRIES will change your life. The burger came i had the wagyu with the fois; i'm 220lbs and i was stuffed i wanted to go home and eat the rest of my burger later; I ordered pork belly sliders also. Decadent was my word for the day. I think about it at least once a month cant wait to relive my experience. If anything i'll order less food but there are so many little edibles to order before you get your burger. Check the reviews on youtube they were rated against the best burger bars in LV and hands down won. Taste, price, atmosphere everything you love about sushi bars, in strip malls, in vegas; great price, a lot of high quality food but with Burgers!"}
{"text":"Roach on the wall..
Won't go back,food was good in the past but the roach on the wall only topped it off...I once ordered a burger and it was completely raw....I took it home and cooked it medium like I asked for.... The staff and management never offered amy compensation."}
{"text":"I live very near this place and have been curious to try it for sometime now as it always seems busy.

Well my curiosity has been satisfied and I'm sure I'll never feel the need to visit this place again.

It struck me as a typical trendy place that yuppies feel they need to visit as all the other yuppies do.  
\"Oh the food is sooo good!!\"
\"Really? You've eaten there?\"
\"No. But all my yuppy friends have and they say it's good so it must be.\"

I only give it a two because the service and presentation of the food was decent.

We ordered something called oxtail fries which were horrible. I'm sure an actual oxtail would probably have been tastier.

My girlfriend and I each ordered a different burger so we could sample each others. Sorry I can't remember what they were called but we didn't care for either one. The best compliment I could pay them is to say they were at least edible.

So as mentioned the service was decent and the food looked presentable but as far as taste I can't recommend this place. 

Perhaps it's just me. Maybe the asian fusion just isn't my type of food. 

I'd rather have a Wendys burger over this place."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place, that I decided to take some friends who've been there before with me one evening.  Granted I know it is in a strip mall and that the space is \"cozy,\" so I was prepared for a little wait.

As soon as we entered, we were immediately greeted by the manager (or owner?) who quickly took our name and asked us to have a seat...should be about 10 minutes. The environment was pleasing...open space, sofas to wait while the tables are being turned over, TV's on the wall...typical neighborhood diner.  And 10 minutes later, we were seated.  

The menu had many eye-catching descriptions for what I've heard are incredible burgers.  If I didn't visit their website beforehand, I wouldn't have really understood (or appreciated some of the selections).  They were limited on their \"adult libations\" to beers, wines and saki...but they were able to create something with saki for our group that was pretty tasty.

The only issue I had with Baci was their service.  It wasn't that it was semi-busy and they had a limited wait staff to serve everyone, it was our server who was not really listening to us and messed up the drink order numerous times and acted frustrated.  To further complicate things, we had multiple servers come by the table to ask the same thing of us...it was like they were not working together in harmony.  Serving the food was a bit unusual as the menu is basically burgers and fries, yet when they brought our food out, they only brought the burgers...saying the fries would be out shortly.  Hmmm, shouldn't you serve them together?

Again, I think the food was incredible and will try other items on the menu again soon...just get the wait staff a little better trained and it should further elevate the experience for Baci Burger."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! Went last night around 7:30 with a party of 8 for a family dinner. The wait wasn't too bad but it did take about 30 minutes to seat us even with seeing quite a few cleared tables.

First things first, the table they sat us at was broken. One of the feet were missing or broken basically making the table a seesaw. Luckily they had some Vegas Weekly magazines up front I was able to slide under the leg to get it even, though my wife gave me a hard time about that! :P

Ok, on to the food (well appetizers first). Since we had a decent sized party we tried a couple different things. The stir fried edamame were great and cooked just right. And since everyone raves about the pork belly, that was definitely a must try. Those things are spectacular, the pork is super tender and the steamed buns are amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce, it's a little too sweet for me but still great flavor. We also got a couple different types of fries that I didn't care for much. The salt and pepper fries along with the truffle fries were just ok. Definitely not staple items off their menu. I will say though that the dipping sauces they give with them are awesome. Another thing I want to mention, even though aren't really an appetizer are the milkshakes...you can't leave without trying one. We tried the mocha nut fudge and salted caramel, just altogether awesome milkshakes!

As far as the \"main\" items go, there were a few things I did and didn't like. I've never tried wagyu beef so I substituted it into my Kiki burger and it is delicious! Not everyone at my table agreed with me but there's definitely a flavor difference and it's unbelievably juicy. They also use some great toppings and everything just tasted really fresh. I also can't say enough about their buns, super soft and really tasty. One of the main gripes I had about this place was their burger cooking temperatures. I love some pink in my burger but my wife doesn't and I'm used to seeing \"medium\" with some pink in it...not at Bachi. Their medium is extremely pink and in my opinion, was a lot closer to a medium rare. If you aren't a fan of pink in your burger, make sure you order your burger medium well at least. 

Even though pretty much everything was good, they are a little pricey.  For 7 adults and 1 kid, our bill was $210 and some change, before tip. They have decent service but it slowed down quite a bit by time we sat down at 8 and the food took a while to come out. I have a feeling that now knowing a bit more about Bachi, I could probably easily bump this up to 4 stars next time I eat there since I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  Busy location, but definitely worth it.  Our waiter was awesome.  Loved the Steamed Pork Buns and the Truffle Parmesan Fries with the Sundried Tomato sauce are amazing.  Great Angus burger."}
{"text":"I love Bachi Burger! I get the Spicy Miso Burger with a veggie patty (they can substitute a veggie patty into every burger on their menu which i love). The service and drinks are great too. Love it here!"}
{"text":"For the past year I've been to this location just about six times the food is amazing but for some reason they can never get their staff organized or do a proper training on customer service. And every time that we come here"}
{"text":"Overated! I heard lots of good reviews about this place, but we felt our burgers were so bland. It lacked that grilled and charred taste that really makes a burger a burger! Wasn't satisfying at all, and a fast food burger would have probably satisfied me more. We tried the $26 wagyu burger too and were extremely disappointed. One more thing was the burgers which start at $12 don't even include fries! Great Asian fusion concept...but needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"I was expecting a good burger from the reviews and the couple of friends I talked to that had eaten here before. I can't speak for all the burgers they serve, but the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger was the BEST BURGER i can remember ever eating. The burger has chili mayo, fried egg, furikake carmelized bacon and onion rings. WOW! Got sides of onion rings and salt & pepper fries which were both good. 

Our waiter was great, the restaurant smallish so you might have a wait but it will be worth it when the food hits the table."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi, if this were 6 months ago you would've been a 5. But you've kind of let yourself go a little... maybe you're getting too comfortable? 

Anyway Bachi Burger is one of those foodie locations that all my friends seem to want to try when they visit Vegas and I usually do highly recommend it to visitors. The restaurant is on the small side, very casual, and filled with tons of modern angry panda art. Their menu covers a huge variety of Asian cultures and flavors in a fusion format combined with classic American burger options such as bacon and fried onions. Generally sweeter than salty. If you really want to get fancy feel free to slap on a side of foie gras though. They have a nice selection of beverages and craft beer as well. 

Things I like: Spicy Miso burger, KiKi's burger (underrated but I love the mushrooms and bacon and gruyere), oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, Hitachino Nest white ale. I haven't met a burger I didn't like! 

Things I dislike: My waiter - he was awkward and cracked a \"Ho\" joke, regarding \"Mr.Ho's Burger\", to a party of Chinese people one of which actually had the last name Ho. It was way more weird than offensive. My burger has been undercooked the last two times so I started ordering it more well done yet it still comes out equally undercooked. I hate asking people to take things back but when they do take your burger they return it to you with the same bun and patty but new toppings. I've never been to a restaurant where they've done that and it seems strange. Parmesan fries are slightly off too lol.

Overall yeah I'd still come back and hope I didn't get the same waiter and that my burger is cooked to a nice correct medium rare. When they do get it right THAT IS A TASTY BURGER doe."}
{"text":"I have now been to all 3 Bachi Burger locations.  This one is my favorite.  Seemed much more roomier they the other 2 locations.  The Summerlin location is always too busy and the wait can be atrocious so I avoid it.  What I have found during my Bachi Burger tour is that they are very consistent.  I am a big fan of the Ronin and Miyagisan Burgers and no matter which location I have had them they are always the treat I expect them to be.   
   I usually end up at Bachi Burger due to friends being in town and hearing about this Vegas treat form Triple D or from Yahoo's beat burgers in the US by state.  I am never upset when asked to meet up at Bachi's.  My friends quickly become jealous of the fact I can have Bachi anytime I want.  
   The service at this location was better then the other 2.  The Summerlin being the worst of the 3 due to servers being overwhelmed.  The Burger was exceptional and unlike any other Burger I have had.  Unique and delicious.  The Ox Tail fries were a treat as always and one order was shared by 3 of us.  it was plenty and we were glad we only ordered one.  
   Their prices are on the high side but considering the quality and the uniqueness of their burgers it is well worth splurging on.  I am looking forward to another visit soon :)"}
{"text":"Straight up 100% legit gourmet burger!  How have I missed this place all this time when I travel here so much each year.  Wow, what a great find and awesome burger.  They do their own buns which makes the burgers that much better.  Try the Ronin Burger or the Black & Green.  The Ronin is Angus Beef and the Black & Green is Wagyu.  Either one is super tender and juicy meat cooked to perfection.  No hockey pucks here folks, we are talking hand formed patties.  Fries - Try the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries after a quarter way through your burger because once you start, you can't stop.  Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I would consider this place a boutique Burger joint.  Average sized burgers at higher than average prices that taste awesome. Love their fries with truffle oil and designer flavor, Asian fruit inspired sodas.  Wish the one in WLA would open soon."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger was amazing!  Really loved the fresh sweet bun that all the burgers are served on and loved the huge portions of perfectly cooked fries!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"if you don't care to have terrible service, go ahead and go to bachi burger! the food can be good, but for the price, the quality for the overall dining experience is compromised. management of this place is poor toward customers and employees. go to gordon ramsay burger or holsteins! around the same price point with much better service!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WEE! Seriously, this place is off the chain. Came here on a Sunday night, I thought it was open till late.. Unfortunately, we came there about 30 minutes till close. 

The waiter said there was going to be about a 15 minute wait and I looked around and there was a few tables opened. I got a bit confused.. but I sat down anyways.

We got seated about 10 minutes later. I did feel a bit rushed in the beginning because the waiter kept reminding us that the kitchen was going to close. BUT.... the rest of the dinner went well with service. This server was TRULY very nice and at that point, I didn't feel rushed at all. If you ever get LANCE as your server, you hit the jackpot for friendliness!!!! 

On to the food,

I choose THE RONIN BURGER. Which was delightful... but it get's a bit soggy. That's my only complaint. There's just a lot of saucy stuff going on there... I put the wasabi mayo on but I actually would have preferred to have it without it. But that fried egg and juicy meat.. god, it was gold! The one thing that I really liked about the burger was the sweet hamburger bun. Not like your average bun. Light fluffy and a good compliment to all the ingrediants in the burger.

The fries were craziness. We ordered the sweet potato fries and the truffle parmasean fries. Both my new favorites...

The malasadas (portuguese donuts) were very good. They ain't no Leonard's Bakery but they were damn good with that cinammon ice cream. It was a nice ending to my already nice experience."}
{"text":"First off.. if you open at 11 then the hostess should be ready to seat customers(we arrived at 1115.) We honestly waited to be seated for 10 minutes and there was plenty of seating. Then this group walks in and the hostess shows up and seats them immediately..WTF!!!!!! (why the face) that group didn't even have the courtesy to tell the hostess \"they were here first\" and the hostess new we had been waiting. I want so badly to give it 1 star based on that incident but those chili fries were good. 
  I will continue to preach this... IT\"S a HAMBURGER not a filet in between a bun.. so why the prices. Don't get me wrong it was good.. I just don't get the pricing on the hamburgers these days."}
{"text":"Terrible 
I got sick of the food, the fries and calimari was very oily, I vomited oil from the food it was nasty, the burgers were dry and when one of the ppl in my party got sick the manager did not want to take food off bill even though we canceled it. They they were watching us as if we were gonna walk out with out paying, I never felt so uncomfortable on a restaurant before. I will never go back"}
{"text":"Place is very unique. The oxtail fries are over rated, basically chili fries...but both burger the wife and I got were awesome! Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place out since the pictures looked so good. It was pretty slow in there which is fine. Kinda weird that they sat a huge group at the table right next to ours when we were the only two groups in there. The food was meh. Not great. Definitely unique, but I kinda felt like I was eating japanese food inside a hamburger. I get that is kinda the point and mash up food is popular right now, but it just didn't sit well. Also didn't feel great for the rest of the day. Probably wouldn't go back, but glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place when the Oxtail-Chili-Cheese fries were recommended. I had the Kiki burger and the fries. Wish I had not waited so long to enjoy this place. The burger was well put together, the bun held up well to the Angus burger. The fries was the star of my meal. I would go back just for the fries alone. I took off a star due to the fact that you could hang sides of beef inside."}
{"text":"One of be best burgers in town
Asian inspired American crafted to perfection

Recommend truffle fries and shogun burger you'll fall in love but spend about 30$ before drink and tip. 

Worth it compared to BURGR by Gordon Ramsey"}
{"text":"Omg. Truffle fries with sun dried tomato aioli, salt and pepper garlic fries with garlic chili aioli w/ a side order of chili and cheese with jalapeños as an app...!!!! Yesss. Spicy Miso burger, delicious! It's kinda messy but so worth it... all you need are extra napkins!! The Crusty Crab (crab cake sandwich) was awesome. I put the garlic chili aioli on the crab cake. It was so good!¡! The crab cake has corn in it which gave it a good texture. Bachi Burger is for sure by far the best food ever! Our waitress was friendly and sweet and our waters were filled the whole dinner. Awesome job at pre bussing! Before we left I got a caramel salted toasted marshmallow milk shake... I freakin loved it! Tasted unlike any other milkshake I've ever had with an actual toasted melty marshmallow on top! There is another location in Henderson on Windmill & Bernuda check it out!! *you can even see a celebrity every now and then! ;o) If your a local or just visiting you need to try Bachi Burger and keep going back! There's so many things to try!!"}
{"text":"I decided to order my burger to-go because I wanted to try it but didn't want to sit down at the place by myself. I just had the normal bachi burger which is okay, but I feel that it's not worth the price. I do want to try a different kind of burger if I ever visit this place again though.  I also had the oxtail fries which sounded amazing but it ended being a little too sweet for my taste. They give you a LARGE portion of it and it was nice of the server to give me a cup of the sauce so the fries weren't soggy. The server that helped me was nice to keep me updated as I was waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Vegas. The bread was super soft and the meat was melt in your mouth delicious!! Don't wait go now."}
{"text":"Best burger by far. Always upgrade to the wagyu beef- don't be cheap and live your life. The only reason for four stars is because the bone marrow disappointed me and the oxtail fries were way too Americanized for my taste. Both the appetizers were over seasoned and too sweet. But the burgers are TOP NOTCH."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I love how they allow you customize your burger to your hearts content! And best of all, you can add foie gras to any burger for $9. Unfortunately, my foie was a bit overdone but I am a foie-aholic so I didn't mind it too much. Haha! Bachi burger definitely satisfied my burger craving!"}
{"text":"Wanted to eat here since I saw it featured on DDD.  My burger was really good.  A bit steep for lunch.  2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 soft drinks including tip was $48.  Glad I gave it a try and will go again but a bit expensive for a casual burger."}
{"text":"Super dissapointed because I heard great things about this place. Waitress forgot our drink order for the group of six, then forgot mine two more times, then tells me they didn't have the drink I wanted in the first place. I order a different drink and by now we all have our appetizers. I have to ask for my drink two more times before I received it. Ashley didn't apologize once. The appetizers were wonderful! We ordered the pork dumplings, the chili fried chicken, the sausages, and their Parmesan fries. All were hot and lived up to the hype. We ordered the wagyu burger medium and received it overly well done. At this point we had a long day and were over the experience. Ashley didn't check back on the food till we all finished. Gave us our checks and didn't even thank us when she picked up our credit card receipts. One person at our table also had an over cooked burger but the one who had the pork belly steamed buns said his food was amazing. Left hungry and dissatisfied.  I was shocked of how terrible Ashley was. Spent $40+ a head for that? I think not again"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I built my own burger. The burger was juicy and had great flavor. I also had the sea salt and pepper fries and those were good as well. The downside was the server she did not recommend anything on the menu she did not ask if we had been here before or anything. We ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and if you can not do spicy food then you should not order these. They put jalapenos slices on everything and if you can not have spice then tell them because stuff is spicy either little or a lot of spice. I will be back with less spice."}
{"text":"I was sure I must have written a review when we came here our first week living in Las Vegas around the end of June.
We fortunately like to eat early because as soon as we were seated a lot of hungry characters followed us in.
Must have been that we were staggering out the door because of the delicious burgers.

I saw the Shogun burger with the wagyu beef and whoa- had to do this. Stupendous flavor. Worth every penny.

Place is cool, staff truly helpful. We shall return!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant because it's highly rated and everyone was raving about it. My coworkers and I decided to come down for lunch. There was eight of us. I ordered the truffle fries,  kiki's burger, and grilled sausages abs was really disappointed. The burger was average. The truffle fries were okay. The sausages tasted like the kind you'd get at the grocery store.

I asked my coworkers and they were equally underwhelmed. The general consensus was we wouldn't be going back for lunch. The food was very mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"This place has some good ramen and the best fried calamari I have ever had in my life. The staff is ok, not great but not terrible. I know specifically what to order when I get there , so there isn't much margin for error. Unless they mess it up. They do have a small menu, which can be a good and bad thing. My friend always orders the burgers and he is never disappointed."}
{"text":"'Discovered' this place via watching \"Diners, Drive-ins & Dives\" on the food network.  Decided to give it a try and glad we did.  

Short version: if you like hamburgers, you must try this place.

Long version: LOT of flavors happening in this food.  The fries are excellent in their own right, and topping them with oxtail chili, cheese and jalapenos turns a side item into an appetizer (or a meal).  The bahn-mi burger was both delicate and hearty, with perfect layers of sweet, savory, spicy and sharp notes in each bite.  My wife had the miagi burger and I got a bite of it, but it was much more subtly delicious and did not stand up to the flavor-forward burger I was already consuming.  She loved it, and the onion rings in her burger were extremely good.

The place is nice with a modern feel, clean and well-ordered.  We experienced no problems with service, our server was spot-on before and during the meal, though after finishing we waited a little longer than we wanted receiving the check.

We will definitely return and bring friends to try it, and I look forward to tasting some of the other really-interesting-looking stuff on the menu.

P.S. You can get a 'regular' burger and fries if you're not adventurous; I will one day because the quality of ingredients and skill of prep promise to make it one of the best burgers in Vegas."}

{"text":"If you're willing to spend a little extra for a \"gourmet\" burger this is the place for you. The oxtail fries were a let down. It's fries topped with an oxtail chili. Can hardly taste the oxtail n so little chili. I'd avoid this item. 

The burgers are awesome!! My favorite is either Mr. Ho's or the ronin burger. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! 

Looks like I'm convincing my coworkers to eat here this Friday. Chee hoo!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a cool spot to go to. They have good chill music always playing and good vibes. Their must try is their chili con carne fries with an egg on top. But if you aren't a big chili person don't get it. Just get the truffle fries instead. 

Their burgers are delicious! I always get the Kiki. 

Not impressed with the ramen though."}
{"text":"This is in my 'hood and I came in really wanting to be WOW'd by the place. But what I didn't expect was a walk down memory lane.

Service 101 memory lane.

1) Always greet the customer when they enter the restaurant. Bachi Burger could really embrace the hipness of the restaurant by shouting out \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye\" when people enter and leave the restaurant. Choose a language. Shout a burger name. Something.
BUT DO NO LEAVE THE CUSTOMER STANDING AT THE DOOR UNSURE OF SEATING THEMSELVES OR WAITING.

What's sad is that there weren't *busy* at the time and even the manager who was by the door didn't greet me. He was busy making change for someone at the register. I know y'all can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say, \"Hello! We'll be right with you!\"

2) Bus the tables, immediately.
It's gross to walk into a restaurant when there's a bunch of dirty tables.
Again... the restaurant wasn't busy. In fact the waiter told me, \"Whew! we just got through with the busiest night!\"

Great.
But just because I came at the end of the rush doesn't mean I should have to sit in a dining room of dirty glassware and dirty tables. 

When I was showed to my table, the waiter paused at 2 tables before deciding the 3rd table was the winner. I had to laugh out loud because it seemed so disorganized to me. I think he mistook my laughter and explained the other tables hadn't been wiped down. He was very sweet and the poor guy tried to explain his way out of not greeting me and the dirty tables.

What really got me was that the waitstaff physically expressed their tiredness from the rush by leaning on tables, stretching in the dining room and squatting to stretch their legs.
Hey gang. Do that in the kitchen where the customer can't see you.
Better yet, get a move on and get the dining room cleaned up.

3) Know the menu.
I've never been here so when I ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blankly and say the burgers.... you've totally lost points with me. BURGER is in the name of the restaurant. I KNOW the burgers are supposed to be good. But which one? Why? What's in it? What's your favorite? You're the freakin' expert. You got trained, right?

4) Don't sweep the floor in front of me when I'm eating.
We're not at McDonald's. 

5) Be attentive to your tables and the ones around you. If you're going to help a fellow waiter out, KNOW WHERE THE GUESTS are in their meal. I had a waiter try to take the plates I was eating from three separate times. Really? I'M STILL EATING. You're cute and sweet but go away!

Learn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.

6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving. It's about as fun as walking into a store and watching the shop girls gossip with each other instead of servicing the customer and getting ready for more customers.

Finally... for the food.....

I had the Kurobuta sausage appetizer and the sausages were cooked perfectly with a slightly crisp skin that clicked as your teeth pierced through. I could have used more mustard though. The last 2 sausages were eaten dry because there wasn't any more mustard in the dish.

The truffle fries were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffle the second try. 

Pork belly steam buns were an unusual twist on the peking duck buns. The horseradish sauce was pretty good with it but I particularly liked dipping the sliced boiled egg in it.

What was most memorable to me was the cherry yuzu soda. I loved it. It was delicious. I'd come back just for the soda.

The potential to be great is totally here. Nice people work here. But they need better training. They don't realize they're doing anything wrong.

If I could see and taste past the service, the food is good. But once a guest has a sour taste in her mouth because of the service, it's hard to get past it.

I know these guys are new and working out the kinks. I really want to love this place so I'll come back in a month or so to see if the service has changed and when I do, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, full of flavor.  Meat was very lean.  Atmosphere is kinda trendy and contemporary.  Our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else, my family and I came here because it was featured on Food Network.  I'm a huge fan of that channel and I wouldn't pass up trying something that Guy Fieri got to eat!  Of course because of this we had high expectations.  What do you expect?

First thing's first, this place was really crowded. There were limited seating in the waiting area and the wait was about 45 minutes.  Now I'm not going to tear this place a new one just because the wait was long and I can feel people practically breathing over my shoulder.

Food was really pricey however, they were delicious. We ordered the ribs as an appetizer and they were fall off the bone.  They used great sauce and plating was really nice.  Only downside is that the ribs were so tiny and for $9 it only came with 4. it was kind of ridiculous.  We each ordered a different burger and we all felt they were surprisingly good.  They were just so many flavors embedded into each burger, almost too many flavors, but it wasted great.  

I also ordered the Almond Boba Milk Tea.  Worst decision I've made.  The boba was just disgusting.  It was so tasteless and I was tempted to ask them to strain it out, but that would be rude.  Every initial sip tasted good cause the milk tea wasnt bad, but after drinking the tea you're left with several balls of boba in your mouth that you're just chewing and chewing... and chewing... and chewing....

So far, food was definitely a 4 star or 4 and a half star range.  However....

The service was awful.  Just so terrible.  Service is what brings customers back.  Just because you're on Food Network and you get a continuous busy flow of customers does not mean you can completely disregard customer service.  After we were seated we were completely forgotten.  We were seated closest to the hostess and the front doors as well.  Our waitress was rude.  Her name was Claire.  She was extremely pushy when suggesting appetizers and she just sounded like she wasnt havin it.  

If it wasnt for the tasty food, which sadly took an hour to get, I'd give this place a solid 2. Actually I'd give it a 1, but the hostess was nice.  She had to personally get our check for us because we were waiting for it for maybe 30 minutes after clearly finished eating, and then it took another 20 minutes for them to take the check away.  Near the end we were all simultaneously bashing the restaurant's service and it made us forget how good the food was entirely.

If its your first time, sure, try the food just to say you've tried this place.  We probably wont come again though, it isnt worth it."}
{"text":"This update is almost 6 years after my previous review, and I stand by my previous review, for the time and place. 

You know, sometimes places have a gradual decline and go downhill... This place has fallen of a cliff and is an unrecognizable shred of the magnificence once exhibited. I just don't understand. Once upon a time, this place was standing room only and understandably so. 

Tonight, it was suspiciously slow. And understandably so. There is a problem when 'the vendors' are responsible for not having anymore fries, anymore mac and cheese, which has miraculously showed up or anymore strawberry for the lemonade. They obviously knew something before I did.

The burgers are still great and the buns are still heavenly. 

Bachi Burger.

{"text":"Been here now 6+ times and have tried many burgers.  Love the burgers, love the steamed buns and love the adult milkshakes.  They combined with the Ramen place next door, which is nice as well."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  This is my kind of eats.   Burger was awesome.. Apps were awesome.  I got the duck steamed buns.    The burger was for sure the star of the show.   Mine had bacon and egg on it, it was pretty amazing and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet. Has lots of burger variety on the menu so it can be hard to choose what you want. 


I went with the oxtail chili cheese fries to start it off and they did not disappoint!!! They were delicious! Lots of flavor and a pretty big portion, we shared it amongst 4 people along with some edamame. 

I struggled on deciding what to get, either pork belly steamed buns or the Banh Mi burger. Luckily our server was very helpful and made some recommendations. I went with the Banh Mi and it was great! 

The only thing I had a problem with was the service. They were very understaffed for the amount of people walking in the door."}
{"text":"Overall, the food had been good here. I don't eat beef, but have enjoyed the veggie burger and the crab cake burger. I've been here with my friends and my family. Generally, they also liked the food, but the portions for children are too much, and there are not many options. Not the best for young children, but older ones should be fine.

Service is still hit or miss and its biggest liability. The staff seem disorganized at times and I've had my food messed up more than once (I've been here more than I've checked in) lately. Sometimes, it seems like some of the servers have never worked in a restaurant before. Other times, the servers have seemed to over compensate becoming intrusive. 

I also got the Yelp check in special of a free beer/beverage, but it had the \"after 11pm\" stipulation and the manager was not as nice to me in terms of getting me the free beverage. (I suggest that they either do away with that \"special\" or offer it at a time that people would actually use it...)

My first impression was awesome. My following experiences have since been not as positive, and some unpleasant almost to the point of not wanting to come back. So, just be aware that service is inconsistent and tends to be slow. Or, they \"disappear\" for a while after you've placed and received your order. Food is good; service needs to improve."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong to come here! They really have a great selection! Not a big menu but perfectly picked to give everyone in your party an option they would love. Our server  Emily was so beyond amazing! So kind and had the best patiences with my party she gave everyone suggestions how to customize our dish. Thank you Emily.  Also the food will take a while to come out I would 100% order an appetizer. Either then that the restaurant flow was perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. This place is great! I like be the MIYAGI-SAN'S BURGER that haswagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. This thing is delicious. The truffle fries are really good too. The atmosphere is nice right by the movie theatre so a good place to take a date before or after a movie. Easy parking. The place is never usually too busy. Service is good most nights I've been here. It just depends if they are busy it lacks a little but overall experience is definitely 5 stars. The food is the winner here."}
{"text":"I went when the A/C was broke and 122 degrees outside, but they were so nice and we were hungry so we stayed because my cousin recommended it.

I had a Thai tea w/ boba, fresh shrimp chips, and duck on steamed buns. Very unique burgers that have a signature taste. I ate everything and wanted more. Asian portions (just enough) which I don't mind because the quality made up for the quantity.

Will be back when we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times when in Vegas.  But today was mostly average.  Nothing stood out to us.  We will try again.  High prices and average food don't go well together, though.  But maybe we need to try other items.  See you sooon Bachi Burger..."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here and had absolutely atrocious service here. First off they brought out the tea in a  not thoroughly washed cup as there was lipstick  on the rim of it. Gross!!!! They quickly took the cup away and then brought one back in under a minute that did not have lipstick on it so my assumption was they took it around the corner, whipped out a napkin and wiped  the lipstick off and then brought it right back out to us  based on the amount of time it took. 
 Next we placed an order for Burgers and Fries the waiter brought out the hamburgers and said the fries will be out a little later. After I finish my sandwich a minute or so later he brought out the fries. They was room temp and really would have been better if I could have had my side with the burger. 
 Also outside smells like horse manure since there are apparently stables near this restaurant... our ticket was $44 for two hamburgers a shared order of sweet potato fries and two teas. This joint has overpriced food that is mediocre at best and the customer service is terrible skip it."}
{"text":"Once upon a time in Vegas a friend mentioned that we absolutely needed to stop by this burger joint, cool enough. I'm thinking premium beef burgers just on another echelon, but when I learned that we were talking Asian fusion burgers, that blew my mind out of the waters! First he enticed me with some talk of a banh mi burger and oxtail fries. I didn't need to hear much after, I was already sold and we were off to that bad boy! 

We first walked in to a pretty chill atmosphere, the place seemed pretty decently sized but small enough to have an intimate vibe. Our group consisted of 15 people and almost right off the bat they were able to accommodate for us, stunning. We were greeted by two young ladies that seemed very comfortable with the size and chaos of our wild group, though these guys were my friends, I would never want to serve us as a whole... These ladies put it down quite effortlessly after all the belligerent yelling of orders and the confusion settled into starving quietness. Anxiously waiting we tried to keep everything as civil as we could but after a few drinks  you already know that's not happening. Through the dining experience the service only got better with a few jokes cracked as to keep the whole experience light hearted and enjoyable. And that it was.. A+ on service!

Now onto the good stuff, the cool of side of the table ;) decided to do a little family style dining as to experience all that bachi burger had to offer. We grabbed 4 shareable plates right off the tee..

The pork belly buns - they were your classic glazed melt in your mouth slab of 3 layered belly paired with a radish, egg and some greens. Sweet, salty and savory harmony of flavors you expect to find in a good belly bun! 8/10

The Peking duck buns - when you go out looking for Peking duck, you're expecting damn crispy skin and hiding under that, tender, juicy duck meat waiting to be chomped down adding in the sweetness of hoisin against that savory succulent bird. Everything was there, don't be afraid of the duck! 8/10

Oxtail fries - simply amazing, crispy fries layered with sweet, spicy, and savory oxtail chili. Hold on, it doesn't end there. When you pair these bad ass ingredients with a fried egg, you simply shot me in the head leaving me dead amongst those who have died in peace... Seriously, the unctuous egg yolk leaves the richest taste in your mouth screaming out as if you wanted the chef to throw in another egg. TO. DIE. FOR. We ordered two, so shall you. 9/10 

Takoyaki - the Takoyaki was okay... Maybe everything else was entirely way too good that I felt like this one fell short, 6/10

Last up the \"shogun burger!\" It's seriously nothing short of epic! The burger is laced with wagyu beef,  unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter and pear. The first salty bite is complimented the sweetness of the fruit cutting against the richness of all the ingredients. The beef seems to be glazed with something cause it's packing a ton of flavor. All of the ingredients work together harmoniously to make this 26 dollar burger a Big Bang. If you're out for something extravagant, look no further 9/10

Overall I'd say this place is a hit, excellent service, good atmosphere and a few things in the menu for adventurous eaters. I bet all the money in the world you're about done with every plain Jane burger joint you've ever been to, just don't come looking for me if you don't like the joint ;) Put down what you're doing and get over to Bachi Burger. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend trying the oxtail chili fries WITH egg!"}
{"text":"just left that place. and big FUCK YOU to the host (asian guy) you forgot to sit us..twice!!! i let it slide the first time. but second time fuck you! you even wrote my name down to be next. now me my wife and daughter left hungry. whoever is that asian guy working the front is stupid.. fire em 9/20/17 around 7:45pm. customer service has become shitty, i just didn't want to say anything but this gone too far.."}
{"text":"I always forget to write a review while I'm there.. Im not a huge burger fan so it has to be pretty amazing to impress me. I actually look forward to eating a burger if were going here!! The parmesan fries, fried egg on a burger.. Its always slammed packed but worth the wait. The service could be a little better but the food is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this place out to see what all the hype was about.
We went there about a week ago and the wait was about 10 minutes, not so bad. It was definitely smaller than I expected.

We ordered the garlic fries which were okay. They weren't soggy which was good. My husband had a make your own burger with an egg, grilled onions, and cheddar and I had the Miyagi burger. The meat was delicious and I would expect it to be so with how much the burgers costed. My burger was actually the first burger I have had that didn't have any cheese on it, but it was still juicy enough to where it still worked out. 

Our server wasn't really that great. We're not the types to want to be checked up on constantly, but not being checked up doesn't go by unnoticed. When my husband got his drink there was a piece of mint or some type of green leaf in it which was big enough to where I don't know how the server didn't see it if he was paying any attention. 

The price for our two burgers, two fries, and a soft drink came out to being about $50 before tip. 

All in all, the place was okay, and not great. It wasn't a place where I knew right away I would be coming back very soon and especially for the price, I didn't feel it was worth it. The meat was good, but I feel like it's only better in your head because you know the beef is grass fed beef. I can definitely eat at different burger joints without missing this place or thinking about it in the back of my head."}
{"text":"Fantastic fusion of American hamburger with Asian flavor. I will be back!"}
{"text":"So this place I went to after reading the amazing reviews on it. I've always been a huge fan of gourmet burger places so this I had to try!

First of all, we were sat down by the server Anh, he was extremely helpful in not only deciding what to order, but made sure we were at a table where we could easily see the NCAA game playing. 

For an app we had the chili fried chicken which was spectacular. Way better than I expected. Also, I decided to try this strawberry lemonade they had. Honestly one of the best tasting drinks I've had anywhere. This is a MUST. As for my burger, I had the Ronin burger which has caramelized onions, cole slaw, and a fried egg on it. I have to say, it was a pretty damn amazing. Now mind you, as far as gourmet burger places, I'm from LA so I'm used to Umami and Stout (the Shu burger at Stout being the best burger known to man) but for an Asian Fusion style burger it was fantastic.

The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is merely because I still consider Stout in Hollywood the best gourmet burger place around. But as far as Vegas is concerned, I've yet to see a place that beats it."}
{"text":"Love In n Out? Forget about it, this place will blow your mind! I've never travelled off the strip for a meal. Boy, I was missing out on the best burgers of mah life! I saw stars and angels while I chomped away, while my taste buds screamed out, \"Hallejuah! Asian! Burgers! Genius!\"

I got to try the miyagi and the kiki burgers and both were divine-okay the miyagi was better because I asked for wagyu beef for my kiki burger and it came out bunless. Not sure if that happens when you substitute the meat or by chance I accidently agreed to no buns?

Bachi Burger, you just made Vegas a whole lot funner for me. Can't wait to come back and try each and every delectable-sounding burger."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best food products off the strip. That said, they have operational issues. They have amazing shakes on the menu, if you're lucky enough to get one. On my first visit, my shake did not arrive before the check. On my second visit this may have happened of if did not insist three times for my shake. After everyone in our party was finished eating, they began to prepare my shake. Apparently they put an item on the menu that they don't have a clear process for delivering. As well the server did not ask if we wanted fries with our burgers. Considering how often they come as a set, they should remind the customer to order fries if they do not. Do eat here, the food is amazing. But do not be too patient if what you ordered does not arrive - if you don't insist, it may never."}
{"text":"Wait? Sure I don't mind waiting. But standing next to the wait to be seated. Party of one ignored for more than ten minutes. No, I actually counted. Asked a server passing by if I may just sit at the bar. Empty except for one patron. No, we have a wait was her response. I've eaten and enjoyed your Raman a couple times. But if you don't have time for me I won't make time for you. Moving on."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and while the food is top notch the service was fair the first time and poor this visit. No one greeted us when we walked in and we waited 5 minutes before being seated. My Dad asked one of the servers for extra spicy mayo and he went on and on how they had to charge us extra. No big deal just bring it. I felt like it was a chore for them to bring us extra napkins and refills on the coffee. I will not go back to this location. The original location will get our business even though it is farther away."}
{"text":"Smaller than the other two locations but nice decor and seating was comfortable. We went with a party of 7 for my brothers Birthday and we called ahead and asked if we could bring in a birthday cake and they were very accommodating. 

We all ordered burgers and the food is consistently good in all locations. I had the myagi wagyu burger which had Carmelites bacon, spicy mayo, and fried onion rings. Very juicy and flavorful. First time trying this burger and was not disappointed at all. The cilantro garlic fries are a must but my husband and I forgot how large the order is and ended up sharing one while the other day untouched. I wish the server would tell you it is large enough to share. 

After the meal I asked the server to put some candles on the cake and she brought it out lit much to my brother's horror, he hates they kind of thing. They were so gracious in providing more plates and forks. Kudos for such outstanding service. Will come back to this location just because of that experience."}
{"text":"My partner and I gave Bachi Burger a try two nights ago. My original plan was not to write a review until I gave them another try but the more I think about our meal, the more I realize I wont be returning. 
The room is loud and uncomfortable. There are tvs on the walls and we were seated under one of them. A  game was on. At any given time, a dozen people were starting at  the tv above us, which just feels weird while trying to eat and several times during our meal some jerk literally walked up to our table to stare into the tv. Way uncool. 
We started with a couple apps. The basic edamame was perfect. The grilled shishito peppers were bland, needed salt and were skewered with little tomatoes which were good and a tough slice of fibrous mushroom. 
We had 3 burgers. The black and green burger was mostly good but had a weird sweetness to it and too much vegetable on top. The same goes for the spicy miso burger. again mostly good but a weird sweetness and a awkward assembly - too much vegggie, topping. Also, I felt like I had to eat it fast to save the bun. The bun made it to the end, but was a dime thin  rubbery disc by the time I finished, and I ate it fast. the third burger, the kiki was just weird. the mushrooms were hard and chewy with a bad mouth feel, it was strange biting into it. Like the previous two, it had a weird sweetness. I didn't finish it. It was just odd tasting. All three burgers felt like unresolved experiments. All three felt  awkward, like a poor attempt at fusion cuisine, too far removed from the familiar burger world but not like any asian cuisine I've had. None of the three burgers tasted all that good and all just felt strange, too sweet, poorly assembled, out of balance. 
We had a side of truffle fries which were served in a cone with a spicy aioli on the side. The fries on top were very good but all of the ones below were wet and soggy. 
We had their recommended portuguese donuts. They were disappointing. Very dense and tough balls of dough rolled in too much sugar and cinnamon served with a bit of rock hard ice cream. I didn't like them at all. Any donut ball from any donut shop would have been a better pastry."}
{"text":"Went to Bachi Burger last night with a mean burger craving. All the amazing burger places are on the strip, as a local the last thing I want to do on a Friday night is go to the strip. 

Ended up getting the salt and pepper garlic fries with fresh jalapeño and minced ginger to start. They were served with some sort of aioli which was amazing. 

I got the Kiki Burger. Angus beef, sautéed shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere cheese, and a garlic chili aioli. I also added some grilled shishito peppers which gave the burger a nice heat. The burger patty itself had a light and sweet BBQ marinade to it. Overall, one of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"1 Word: WOW. 

This place was incredible. 

I have heard about this place a bunch of times but never had a chance to check it out. Finally went yesterday for lunch and I cannot wait to go back again. Make sure you have an appetite because these burgers are the real deal. 

I was starving and order the Parmesan fries an Kiki's burger- easily one of the best burgers I have ever had. 

Everything was perfect-so fresh. My friend ordered the spicy miso burger and that was delicious too!

I will definitely be back and recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Great burgers, very juicy and not your ordinary burger. Different options than the norm. I also like to sit down and eat a burger rather than just drive through or fast food so this gives a great mid range option."}
{"text":"Amazinggggg burgers. My hubs had the miyagi burger and I had the kiki's burger. We each halved our burgers and swapped each half so we can try both! They were both so delicious in different ways. The cook on the burgers were perfect and consistent. Nice charred crust on the outside and juicy pink in the center. We also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and loved it. The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because we ordered a shake to come with the food and it took forever to come out. Our server (or should I say the only server) asked us specifically if we wanted our shake to come out before the food or after and we told her before; it ended up coming out after. We were one of maybe 4 tables there at that time so I'm not sure why it took so long for a drink to come out. The wait for the food took awhile and I was excited to have a few sips of my milkshake while we waited. It was fine though because we treated it as a dessert after our meal. If you like baileys, then order the \"Nightcap\" milkshake!"}
{"text":"First, we love the food here.  We usually get the same things and they always taste great.  Oxtail chili fries, pork belly buns, duck buns, sweet potato fries, salt & pepper garlic fries, and all the burgers are great.  Good selection of craft beers and my kids love their milk shakes.  

So why only 1 star??  Management (or ownership) here is terrible.  

There is never a host at the front, so you have to wait for one of the servers to free up some time to seat you.  

They don't have bussers, so usually we bus our own tables by putting our empties on an empty table next to us.  

They don't have an expeditor in front of the kitchen, so sometimes your appetizer will come after your entree.  

The servers are very nice.  They try hard.  They work hard.  

Finally today after several mishaps, I asked our server why the quality of service is so poor.  

He explained that the owners expect the servers to seat customers, bus their own tables, make milkshakes, etc.

I assume it is the reason the restaurant was 1/2 empty during 7pm dinner on a Friday evening.

Oh yea... and then we ordered two burgers to go.  Each cost $15.   They wrapped it in paper and but them in a bag.  lol.  Not a box.  Not a container.   They put it in paper like fast food drive thru."}
{"text":"Ok.... I saw this place on one of those food channel/network program and I bookmarked it, make sure I come visit when I'm in town.  

This review is for take out only.  I ordered the ronin burger, pork belly sandwich, a fish burger and garlic fries ( don't have the exact name of the items I ordered) the ronin burger costs $10, when I ate it, my thought was..... Should of gone to In & Out burger.  Lots of meat (I want a burger, not steak) the meat wasn't seasoned and it was just too much meat for my taste, nothing special.  The pork belly.... Over cooked.  The fries was ok, didn't try the fish sandwich, couldn't comment on it. 

I was never a fan of asian fusion food - as for this place, i probably would not go back.  Reason being so, for the amount I'm paying for a burger, I personally like In & Out burger better, as for the Asian side, it's ok, I'll go to an Asian restrurant.  Sorry...."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to coming here after seeing this place showcased on Food Network and reading many positive reviews on Yelp.  I was a bit disappointed however with my experience at this Bachi Burger. The  burger I had was so so, nothing I would come back for, the after taste from eating it reminded me of the burger for longer than I would have liked. Also had the infamous ox tail chili fries which was good and I would recommend. Ambience was a kind of like Applebee's, lot of screaming kids in there which kind of took away from enjoying my meal. Bottom line place is average, I think you can find a better burger for half price elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"the fish burger here is good and comes w/ a sweet sauce that's yummy.  i also tried the shishito peppers and the house salad.  my friends also got the oxtail chili cheese fries, fried chicken, sweet potato fries and truffle fries, and they said it was all good."}
{"text":"I entered the door and was hit with such a wonderful aroma, I thought for sure this sis gonna be great! I'm feeling good about my choice and then I met the wanna be hostess. To say that she was rude and disorganized would not be doing this post justice.
Luckily the real hostess Stacy came to the rescue. She offered me and the hoard of people standing in what could only be considered a vestibule with one too many plants & too few chairs a cool drink while we waited. (Thank you Stacy) 
Once seating became available for me to sit at the bar (about half an hour later) I was seated and given a menu. I asked the friendly couple sitting next to me what they would recommend and once they did I perused a little longer and then made my selection. I had the KiKi burger with a side of Truffle Parmesan fries & a coke. 
I waited what seemed like a while but once my food came I was glad! it looked really appetizing and tasted even better!!!
The flavors were dancing on my tongue and had a rhythm all their own. It felt like a party in my mouth and I was thankful for the invite. :-D"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, too bad the service is not. It's like everybody on that staff is clueless. I don't think anybody that works there has ANY proper service industry training. I've never had my meal come before my appetizers...weird. I was an expediter for several restaurants and I can tell you that's NOT how it's done. My water was dropped off 20 minutes after we were seated and never filled again. First time at this location, and I will NEVER be back. Too bad because the one in summerlin is really good. I feel really bad for the owners. Their staff clearly does not care at all. Perhaps it's better on a different night but we came on a Tuesday afternoon and it was not busy and the service was still terrible. A room full of people agrees."}
{"text":"Bursting with amazing flavor no matter the dish you order, if you are up for unique flavor with typical American fare, come here immediately. Zack is an amazing server, no note pad needed, your order taken down, all in his awesome memory! Love me some bachi!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is yum! Oxtail chili cheese fries were amazing! So big we will have to come back to try the burgers"}
{"text":"Ok, so i'm writing this update because they've got a couple new burgers that I absolutely must share... my newest love - the Miyagi-San.  Do it!  The furikake and fried egg should be more than enough to throw someone over the edge.  Delicious.

The other favorites are a tie between the Shogun and Mr. Ho's burgers.  One is uber fancy w/ the foie gras and the other has a weird Hoisin Mayo and Taro Bun combo... interestingly tasty.

As much as I LOVE this place... they do need to work on the dessert options.  The fruit tart was amazing when they had it (got discontinued).  Despite being almost always too full to order anything after my burger and truffle parm fries... sometimes I want something sweet.  Unfortunately, there aren't any decent options.  Please look into a Bachi Brick Toast (you know what I'm saying?!).  It's what you're missing!"}
{"text":"The best burger and ramen that i ever had. 

I will always go to this place whenever we will visit Las Vegas. 

Service is also nice."}
{"text":"Came here at recommendation of a friend from Bay area who claimed that he MUST eat at Bachi burger everytime he is in Vegas. Ordered the oxtail chili fries and the shogun burger. The fries are crispy and not oily but I can hardly taste the oxtail in it. To me it tasted more like a regular chili cheese fries with some shredded meat. The Shogun is good IF you can finish it. I can only handle 1/2 of it. I love the Asian pear in it, somehow it makes me feel the burger is not as heavy and fruits make it healthier. My husband is not a burger eater so he ordered the ramen which is just average."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town period!!! 

Odds are you will have to wait awhile to be seated. We've been here multiple times and its typical to wait. They can refer you to the summerlin location for a shorter wait, however, this location makes a better product in my opinion. If you don't like any waiting and have no patience, this place is not for you 

The oxtail cheese fries are a must. My favorite burger is the miyagi san! I've sent multiple people from out of town here, as well as use this as a typical spot to bring people from out of town. Everyone is always thoroughly impressed! Its just a known fact that there will be a wait."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Only knock would be that in my opinion the one on windmill puts out a slightly better product but regardless, they do an amazing job!

The miyagi san is the best along with the oxtail fries! When in the area, a definite must stop"}
{"text":"I want to like this location (Windmill). When they opened, I was a regular (one mile from the house); and then the prices went up, the service dropped and it was always crowded. (A good thing for them) 

However, the last two times I have returned have been dismal. On my most recent visit, I felt that the objective wasn't on service but on ignoring the empty glasses on the table, the waves by the wife of my friend. (I was hosting another couple) And my table didn't want to order water, we wanted to order (Profitable) beverages. 

I finally rose from the table, found our waiter and asked, Has the policy changed? You don't serve second drinks to customers? His response, \"Absolutely\" Which didn't make a lot of sense, but by that time, we were, in a word, done and not only had we been waiting for second drinks, but we were trying to get someone's attention to pay the bill. Is it me, or should our waiter want to be paid? Our entire party was dismayed by the service, or lack of.

Okay, the service was ... in a word..a failure, so move onto the food. Not to the caliber of the early days, when Bachi seemed excited to deliver a new and exciting product. The foods seems to have been value engineered to the degree that they are counting on tourists to support the revenue goals, i.e. Eat and never come back. 

My friend summed it up in one question, \"Why did you want us to come here?"}
{"text":"I had a love affair with bachi burger especially when i still lived in vegas. I still make sure to stop by whenever I am home to get my fix. 

The Kiki burger is far and away the best burger here and I've tried almost all of them. It's bursting with flavor from the onion marmalade and mushrooms and to-die-for bacon. I used to crave this constantly. 

The banh mi burger is another solid burger choice with fresh vegetables and a delicious sauce to dip the burger in. It also has a very unique curry aoili that's a great addition. 

Not a fan of any burger with a taro bun but that's just my own taste. 

All the fries are great but the garlic fries are my favorite. Wasn't crazy about the oxtail fries, a little heavy and monotonous for my taste  but my brother enjoys them. The pork buns are okay but i wouldn't order them again. 

Sometimes the service is great and other times it can be very slow."}
{"text":"So me and my family did a burger challenge in vegas and bachi happened to be one of our stops..we saw the place on diners drive ins n dives and the reaction of Guy of the food sold me..i shouldve known better than to trust Guy..we ordered the banh mi burger, oxtail chilli fries and the duck buns...the burger was very unique..thats probably why the kids hated it..i probably wouldve enjoyed it alot more if i didnt previously just have the best burger i ever ate at BurGr..as for the oxtail fries...i love oxtail and i think that set my bar for the dish very high..it was a regular bowl of chilli fries to me..and it wasnt even regular, it was wayyyy too salty...the duck buns were ok..the staff was friendly, but our napkins ripped as they were pulled away from the sticky table..food was average at best.."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Bachi Burger. The Truffle french fries is a must for any newcomers. I get the Angus burger and add the blue cheese, yummy."}
{"text":"Fancy, tasty burgers and sides and drinks! What more can you ask for? 

Def a place to grab lunch before the long trek back to LA.

Though the Foie burger could do without the unagi. Though I normally LOVE unagi, it did nothing to the sandwich beside made me more stuffed and cost me more money."}
{"text":"Always amazing food here at Bachi Burger! I try a new burger every time. Haven't been let down not once."}
{"text":"One waiter was very rude
I didnt hear him ask for my plate so he hit the side of my arm to get my attention."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here.

Must have had a change in management, but the changes was for the better.  The staff expedited orders much more rapidly.   Communication was more clear this time with their team and was apparent in servicing guests.

Had the Kiki Burger was was awesome.  If you don't like mushrooms, then this is not for you.  Flavoring of the garlic aioli, mushrooms, and bacon were perfect.  My husband had the Spicy Miso burger (topped with egg) which is more of his preference.  We had regular fries, which we could share.  On previous occasions we tried the sweet potato fries and parmesan fries.  All are great accompaniments.

A group could fit; however, this location is fairly small in size, so if it was busy expect a long wait.

Total before tax came to $27 for two burgers a one fries. Hopefully that will help you gauge what to expect for prices."}
{"text":"the wait was horrendous. packed full of people inside so we were waiting on the side walk in the vegas heat. 120 deg just waiting for people to give up and leave.
once we got in there were plenty of seats not even being touched. so im not sure what the hell was going on where we had to wait over a hour outside when there were tables upon tables of empty seats. 
food wise, it was ok- i wasnt blown away but it was good.
the burger is a little intimidating,  you read all these funny things like what the hell is this- with no explanation and no waitstaff to help you because they are close to non existent other then to bring the food out. but you muster up some courage and pick something.
we got chili fried chicken- which was good, very crispy even though it was smothered in sauce. 
and we both got the ronin burger. a messy disaster but tasty.
with sweet potato fries.

the food was decent. everything else was kinda lacking."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Not with the food but the service. As a long time customer who visited before they got famous, I was appalled to find they have poor customer service and poorly trained staff. Why make people wait for their entire party when there are plenty of tables open at 3pm?! Does that mean everyone has to ride together every single time?!

Ridiculous policy. Ridiculous staff. Ridiculous for me to drive from summerlin to this location anymore. 

P.s. The summerlin location is even worse so don't go there unless you like a side of upset with your sub-par meal."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Bachi Burger's food, 5/5 - but this location's service and speed here just continue to disappoint. So much so that I'll have to give a general rating of 1/5.

Every 3 months I try to give this location another chance, and it never gets better, sometimes even worse.

I can tell the staff is polite but they are often inefficient in taking your orders, fulfilling requests and come across as being inexperienced. Even though it's been a whole year since they've opened.

Once you order with the waiter, expect to wait more than half an hour for a burger. Don't ask me why it takes that long to cook up a burger.

And god forbid if you need to change something on your bill. Because they will have to ask someone else to do it, and who knows what happens after that... but I found myself annoyed and tapping my feet next to the register after 15 mins of waiting and trying to catch someone, anyone's attention.

I'm going back to the days of driving to Windmill to have a Ronin Burger. You can't go wrong with the original and the staff there is fast, efficient and friendly.

I hope they don't bring this horrible service to their soon-to-open LA location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend LOVES this place. Absolutely loves it. 
Me.. I'm kind of over the fact that the burgers are kind of expensive for what they are, and they don't even include fries. Not a huge deal, except for the fact that if you order the fries separately, you'll find they really aren't that good. Nice and crispy, but they lack in seasoning. I tried the truffle fries, and the sauce was good, but the fries were still flavorless. 
The last time we were here, I ordered my drink and waited 20 minutes for the server to get it. He had completely forgotten about it, and the restaurant was empty. And no, he didn't magically remember, I had to flag him down to inform him of the obvious. No refills either. 
Come here for a tasty burger, not for the service, or for the fries.. You want that, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awful service. Waited way too long to sit down. (there was very few tables occupied). After 25 minutes for them to put sliverware on a table we ordered the \"pickles\" appetiser,  not a good choice. Not sure what is was supposed to be. But it wasn't good.  The friesthat  came out cold  - on both of our orders. And then when my caesars salad came out with chicken - I ordered it with a crab cake - I wanted to rage, but, instead I just asked for them very politely, to make me a new one? Instead of picking the chicken out - She goes, \"Oh, I can take the chicken out.\"  I said NO I have a reaction to chicken. Please make me a new one she said Okay, I will take the chicken out.. I was like, HUh? No please do not do that..... WEll, I inspected the salad when it came back and was hopeful I had a new one. But, half way down the bowl I ate and Uh-oh, what did I see but chicken chunks.... I almost blew chunks rite then and there!! After asking for the Mgr -20 minutes for the manager to come over. 25 more minutes after I told her what happend. I was having a panic attack. My stomach was doing flips. I didn't know how much I ate or what \"juice\" of chicken I had. When I asked for the Manager again - seriously, yes, again... (what was she doing, hiding from me?) she came out with the chef. At this point I was gagging and had to leave. I didn't want to listen to the excuses of why  - - just get me out of here. Oh, yeah, and thanks so much for the phone call to see if I was okay??? You people have no clue how to cook, run an eating establishment or give any and I mean ANY type of service. This fly by night opperation should be shut down. It was awful and not just a fluke how they didn't handle this whole ordeal. WHO PICKS OUT CHICKEN AFTER SOMEONE TELLS YOU THEY HAVE A REACTION TO IT?? ARE YOU JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL ELECTIVE COOKING CLASS 1O1 ? No, I am sure they would've taught you guys to re-make it espcially when I had to ask - And still, you didn't. Clearly, you can't get a salad right. Or fries. So, people beware! They are fakes. Real chefs don't do this. Either do real kitchens. And real wait staff would never take shortcuts like this gambling with peoples health."}
{"text":"A group of girls and I went to this place because someone went here in a past Vegas trip. It's a little ways away from the strip, but the trip was totally worth it. 

It's an Asian take on the traditional burgers and fries, but in a tasteful and gourmet way! Small restaurant in a random plaza, but hey, no long wait. deserves it though, haha. 

We ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries and the truffle Parmesan fries as an appetizer. SO good. he sauces that go with both of them really complement the fries well. the Salt and pepper is definitely my favorite, since it has more spice and kick with the jalapenos and the sauce. Two orders of fries fed 7 girls well, so it's pretty well portioned here.

While many of my friends got Kiki's burger, and the Ronin, I got the Kalbi burger, mostly because of my love for kimchi. It's extremely tasty and ridiculously filling to the point of 'Oh my I'm TOO full...but it's so good!\" Kalbi ground  beef, kimchi, onions, a massive burger roll, and spicy cucumbers on the side. For someone who loves Korean Food, this definitely impressed me. 

This is a pretty random place to go, especially when you surrounded by all this food on the main strip, but check this place out!"}
{"text":"And here I am thinking that this place was a hidden gem. 82 reviews before me? I'm instantly flaccid. This is like finding out your favorite band is opening for Nickelback.

Ronin burger. Parmesan truffle fries. Lychee soda. Like --- total stomach erection.

Best part is that it's open late... it's going to give Naked Fish a run for its money as a late night poker hangout!"}
{"text":"I saw this featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives from the food channel. The chef made oxtail chili cheese fries on the show. It looked SO good we ate here the next day. 

PROS:
***Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - sweet and smoky chili with shredded oxtail and beans, topped with a over easy fried egg. Break the yoke into the skinny fries and cheese and MAGIC! (enough for 2 or 3 people)

Kiki Burger - beef, sweet onion marmalade, chili mayo, bacon, sauteed enoki and shitake mushrooms (added a fried egg on the burger; $1.50 extra charge well worth it.) Medium rare (and that it was).

Homemade blueberry \"pop tart\" with ice cream- two small but rich fresh blueberry pop tarts (square and surrounded with a soft thin pastry shell) on top of a smudge of fresh blueberry sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I'll be back. . . again and again."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the burgers were good. If you're looking for a good quality burger, you'll get one here. 

I downvoted it for the service and the value. The burgers are good, but range from $13-16, with an up-charge for substitutions or extras. For the quality, it should have been closer to $10-15. Same for the sides - $4 but should have been $2-3. 

The service was slow and inattentive. We told the waiter that we didn't want anything with heat. However, we ordered garlic fries and didn't notice that it had jalapeño until it got to the table. I would expect the waiter to at least check that we knew it had jalapeño after we were so adamant that we did not want anything hot. Nope. Took our order and disappeared.  

Good burgers, but will not be back."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars.

I ordered the Kiki burger along with the salt and pepper garlic fries. Let me tell you, that burger was no let down. The meat was thick and juicy. They ask you how you want it done, and I got mine medium. The mushrooms were awesome. Those fries were DELICIOUS. My burger and fries both came with a side of sauce. I don't remember what sauce it was, but boy did it compliment that burger and fries.  The burger might not look big, but it sure is filling.

Along with the burger and fries I ordered an almond milk tea with boba, and I should know better than to order boba from a burger place. The almond did not have much flavor, and the boba was bland as well.

The waiters were friendly, nice, and patient. If I come back to Vegas I'd definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was awesome, my server helped me pick out somethin super yummy since I had never been here before, he was so nice and helpful, and the almond milk tea with boba was soooooo good lol"}
{"text":"O Bachi Burger, you are as delicious as people raved. The semi sweet bun, the juicy patties, delicious dressing and the must have pineapple ketchup!! I drool just reminiscing about the Miyagi and the Kiki. 

However, the oxtail chili cheese fries didn't taste as amazing as i hoped it would, not that it wasn't good, it just didn't seem to be as special as some hyped it to be. Service was also a bit on the slower side for it not being busy. 

O well, I still love you regardless"}
{"text":"The food here is toooo die for! My favorite is the Oxtail chili cheese fries. It's a must have when we go. I try a different burger every time and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEE this place!!! They have the best oxtail fries i have EVER eaten. The burgers are different, tasty, delicious and pretty big. My husband and I shared a burger, oxtail fries and duck bun. They truly know how to perfectly cook the burger to the finest taste. This place is very popular and does get packed really fast. My 1st visit we waited over 2 hours to get seated but now i go after midnight and there is no wait what so ever. It's great that they open till 2am. Every vegas trip from now on Bachi Burger is a must have before we go home."}
{"text":"Delicious food and probably the best burger in Las Vegas.  BUT make sure you have plenty of time to wait...  Once you put your name on the list its a good 45 minutes before you get any glimpse of your food.  If servers here worked in an emergency room patients would be dead in the grave before they got their name called..."}
{"text":"This is so delicious I almost don't want to review it and let other people in on the place. We got the Kiki burger and miyagi, I think. They were both fantastic. The salt and pepper garlic fries were the best part. What a unique Vietnamese flavor. Atmosphere was mellow with good tunes, clean tables, and great service. Only negative was that the women's room has a broken door, so it couldn't be closed....seems like something that should be fixed immediately. Totally going to be my only burger spot from now on. Next time I will come for dinner and get a beer. Yum!"}
{"text":"Burgers with a little Asian kick to it is pretty awesome. I highly recommend the Kalbi burger! The service is also great, our waitress was nice and sweet"}
{"text":"So here is my last trip in a nutshell: out of nearly all ingredients, service was MIA,  tables were a mess and food quality seems to have dropped off a cliff. A few years ago Bachi used to be one of the more creative burger places in town but they have been on a steady decline for some time. Go ahead and sort the Yelp reviews here by date and you will see that I'm not the only whose noticed that Bachi is circling the drain. 

On this last trip, Bachi did a great job of making our party wait for nearly 30 minutes while half the tables sat empty. When staff was finally done ignoring us, our server informed the our party that the kitchen was pretty much out of everything: no Oxtail fries, no blue cheese, no duck sliders, no Portuguese donuts, and nothing on the ramen menu was available. Umm why didn't they just put a sign up to tell us this? 

I ordered Kiki's burger which came out overcooked and dry. The desperately needed aioli showed up 20 minutes later after having to ask our server twice. I don't know how they justify charging $15 for a charred burger with some KBBQ sauce drizzled on it.  Food came out inconsistently, half of our party was done while the other half hadn't even been served yet.

What makes this whole ordeal even worse is that Bachi actually used to be pretty good a few years ago. The only reason this isn't a one star review is thanks to me fond memories of what this place used to be."}
{"text":"this place was more hype than anything, i was there last year with a friend for SEMA and we had heard about this place on where else. they made it was the best thing since sliced bread. we talk about going there to try it. first when we got there it took us forever to get seated (which i thought was a good thing) we ended up being seated in like the very back by the toilets. the service was terrible, i was served a coke and it was flat! when i asked for another one i was given attitude. so on to the food, i ordered the mr miyagi burger and my friend ordered the bahn mi burger. mr miyagi wasn't horrible but wasn't all that into it. my friend let me try the bahn mi burger and it tasted like there was way too much going on. i realized i would have been better off just going for bahn mi sandwiches for maybe 8 bucks and had better quality. we ordered the chili fries and they were  about the only thing that was good. they were not bad. but overall my experience sucked. (oh and i think the fact i could smell the stank from the bathroom didn't help) 

so maybe for a once in a lifetime trip would be cool if you dont eat much asian food, but if you do avoid it, way too pricey (2 burgers, 1 beer and two sodas and fries was a little more than 50 bucks) and seems to be just the hipster place to go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite culinary movements that's finally penetrating non-coastal cities here in the U.S. is proper Asian-American fusion, and for that reason I really wanted to fall in love with Bachi Burger. The menu was spot on, but the product delivery fell just a tad bit short of what I've had elsewhere.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

No complaints about the service at Bachi. Service was fast and friendly, and while I was ever so slightly irked that I couldn't order just a single pork bun to try it with my burger (instead had to order three and later hate myself) everything came together. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

As I've now harked on at length, $15.00 is my cap on a sit down burger spot with very few exceptions. Bachi must feel the same way, as their most expensive burger the Miyagi-San comes in right at $15.00. The burger isn't quite as large as the oversized bun and the even more oversized onion rings allude to, but it's by no means a rip off. 

From there, my three (small) duck pork buns were $12.00, or $4.00 each, which also wasn't a deal nor a ripoff. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Honestly both of my dishes at Bachi Burger were just okay -

I started with the Duck Pork Buns, which, while obviously freshly prepared and with good ingredient proportions, didn't have a ton of flavor. The cabbage and carrots and egg downplayed the duck a bit to the point where the accompanying sauce was needed, and the bao was ever so slightly sticky, which can happen if they sit out for two long. 

The burger was a similar story. The absurdly large bun was unnecessary apart from optics, and while I like the onion rings I did end up picking two of them off so that I could actually taste the burger patty, which was decent but not packed with it's own inherent flavor. The cheese and egg paired nicely, but all in all this was just a good burger - not a great one. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Vegas these days is so stacked on Asian and burgers alike that I can't say that i would. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers off the strip.  Service was excellent. The staff was knowledgeable on the menu. Had a person with fish allergy in our party and they went above and beyond to accommodate him. The pork belly steamed buns and Bahn mi burger was great. The Oxtail Fries were ok. Nice and trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pork belly on the steamed buns, Kalbi burger and oxtail chili cheese fries with a fried egg - feast of kings. If i had to choose my last meal on this earth, i would want to go to this place. What a gem to find in Vegas. Superb. Saw on food network and had to visit. Wish they had one in San Diego, CA.  Absolutely loved the food and experience. When back in Vegas, Bachi burger is a must have. Deserves 8 stars not 5. Above and beyond!!"}
{"text":"In the mood for an interesting fancy burger with a twist?  This is your place.  The menu is amazing and I must say they have created some ideas for burgers that my brain could have never fathomed.  I got a burger with shrimp and pork in the beef and curry aioli and a fried egg on top.  Great apps and fries too!  Service was flawless and the price isn't bad.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I was hoping the burger itself would've been a little bigger (but I'm a country boy) and the atmosphere is a little bland.  But I'll be back no question."}
{"text":"Went here today for a burger and beer brunch.  Our service was very good considering our server had to man all of the tables.  We had the oxtail chili cheese fries to start.  I liked them but there was definently not enough oxtail.  I had kikis burger, medium and the mr. had the myiagi, medium as well.  You can tell that they use fresh, high quality ingredients.  If you love mushrooms and onions on your burger, go for kikis burger, you will not be disappointed.  I'm looking foreward to coming back and trying the pork belly buns!"}
{"text":"Let me put it this way. Nothing here tasted bad its the best stuff as far as fusion food here in vegas."}
{"text":"First of all, wait staff was attentive, friendly and apologetic.  Otherwise this might be a 1 star review. 

However, this was a very disappointing experience. I had been to the location on Sahara and had a great experience and great food. I wanted to bring my friends here and was disappointed it wasn't as good as I remembered. 

After we ordered, it took maybe 5 minutes for our ramen to come out which was pretty fast. But our burgers took another 20-30 minutes to come out. We thought they forgot our order. When the food came, the burgers were over done and the buns were too toasted. We saw a little boy at the next table whose bun was burnt! We ordered two medium burgers and one medium-well and all three were well done and too dry. 

The ramen was very good so I would get that again. 

I would hesitate to come back here as it's hard to tell if it'll be any good. Maybe I would check out the Sahara location again since it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The service is the worst here. Takes forever to order even drinks . Food is amazing but worst service"}
{"text":"One star for horrible service. Rude, said they were understaffed, and wouldn't seat us even with many open tables and plenty of staff around. Mind you I was a server and now manager so I know they were being inconsiderate when I watched atleast 4 tables leave and they STILL refused to seat us. Food came out cold and wrong from what we ordered. Tasted ok. Overall disappointed in the amount of money we spent for crappy food"}
{"text":"At first I was feelin the vibe. Everyone was so nice and food was fast and also was delicious. But towards the end of our meal, our server was not checking up on us. I mean we understand that there's other table to tend to but it was not that busy for anyone to come check is we needed anything else.... I was fine with that but when I ordered tonkatsu ramen Togo, I was excited to get home to it. As I opened the box, there was no meat. No tonkatsu. My ramen tasted like crap without it. It was such a disappointment that I was even thinking about posting this but I did. I'm upset that my ramen didn't look like how my boyfriends ramen did when he had it at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST BURGER I have ever tasted! YUM!!! It's a very unique place with VERY tasty food! I can't wait to go back just to try something different. You are missing out if you don't stop & try this place. It's close to the 15 & 215 fwy just before you make it into the Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"I have heard and read so many reviews about this place that I finally decided to check it out for myself. Just walking into the place, it smelled so appetizing that I couldn't wait to start eating. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with choosing the things off the menu because this is definitely not what you would call a typical burger joint. We started off with the Thai iced tea and then ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu burger and the Truffle Parmesan fries. The food did take a while to come out but that is because everything is prepared fresh. The burger consisted of chili mayo, fried egg, crispy onion rings and caramelized onions. It was so big that I could barely try to take a bite out of it. The wagyu was so tender, that it just melted in my mouth. There was so much flavor in the burger that each bite put a smile on my face. There is no certain way to describe the truffle parmesan fries with the dipping sauce except that it was like a party in my mouth. The fries are drizzled with black truffle porcini cream and grated parmesan. All the food is very reasonably priced and I wish I had room to try some of their dessert. I can't wait to go back and try the different burgers and desserts on the menu. I'm not even a huge burger fan but I am in love with this place!"}
{"text":"THE SHOGUN BURGER.

THE
BEST
BURGER
I'VE
EVER
HAD

You absolutely have to order this burger if you come here!!!! Yes, it's pricey, but it was definitely worth the $26 I spent on it! I almost didn't order it because of the price, but my boyfriend really wanted it so we ordered it! I'm not usually a fan of fancy burgers.... I;m usually satisfied with In N' Out. But this burger changed my life! And now I know... If I didn't order that burger... I would've been missing out on THE BEST BURGER ever made in the history or burgers!

The Shogun Burger:
Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and a Yamamomo Peach Palette Cleanser 

The other food I ordered at Bachi Burger was also excellent! I ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Buns and the Ox Tail Fries. Both were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I could go on for days about how awful the service is at this location. It is truly the worst service I have received in any restaurant EVER. My girlfriend and I have had good experiences at this location and others in the past. I'm not sure what is going on. We went to this location last night and were seated immediately. 25 minutes went by and nobody said a word to us. We walked out. I wrote it off as a fluke and we decided to revisit tonight. The same two servers were working and the restaurant was not busy at all. To say the servers were clueless is truly an understatement. Where in the f&@k are the managers!?
It took 20 minutes to get water, another 15 minutes to get a beer and nobody's meal came out at the same time. Also, the server informed us that our appetizer was not available after he brought us our entrees. Thanks a lot...
This location is in a world of hurt...."}
{"text":"Food was good. The mix of flavors was ono too. We had a little taste of everything....dessert was pretty good too. The servers were also nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster for giving these folks a liquor license, because they do a grand job with it. A bevy of Dogfish Head & Rogue seasonals and special brews (this particular trip was My Antonia, an imperial pils with hops that'll kill a lesser man) plus a sake menu that propriety dictates I shouldn't wade into for the simple fact that I'll have to drive home following this foray. 

Service: Very attentive and not shy about suggesting their favorite burgers, which was helpful for me as a newbie. Water never got less than half full (and was refilled & looked after by everyone walking by, not just my primary server).

Food, the meat of my review (har, ha... Nevermind): I got the Kiki Burger, taking the recommendation of one of the wait staff, because mushrooms kick ass. Holy double-hockeysticks, this is one delicious burger. I ordered medium-rare (the cognoscenti's level of doneness...) and it is fantastic. The bun's toasted like Texas Toast, the spring greens are crisp, the burger is juicy. I've long-since forgotten the type of sauce that it comes with (which I quickly taste-tested with a tempura-fried onion ring) but it's all over my buns and has a nice complimentary sweet-spice to it. The mushrooms are delicious and, as a previous reviewer has said so eloquently, \"d@mmit, Bachi Burger has ruined all the rest of the burgers I'll eat in the future because they're so d@mn good\". Or something like that. Either way, I'm in heaven - great big, beautiful beer, unbelievable burger and light, crispy onion rings in a happy environment."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple months ago with my gf.  Ambiance was nice the hostess lady was kind.  We sat down and we had a Filipino waitress named Ericka  that was funny and helpful.  She laughed at all my jokes but it seems she is a bit fob which made the experience more fun. But we had a couple conversations about the menu and she gave us her opinions and recommendations.  We ordered oxtail frys since she recommended it and it was pretty good.  For my main dish I got the ronin burger and it was amazing!! Will come back whenever I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"After hearing my girlfriend rave about this place for months, we finally got a chance to dine in and I got to see what the hype was about. 

My review is mostly about the service. These guys were on top of it. We had came in just before the dinner rush so not want too busy. Our server was very curious and not overbearing. They were quick to bring out food and refill my drink leaving me with an amazing dining experience. 

Now personally I felt the food wasn't anything I haven't tried before. We started with the truffle fries. The serving portions were a bit smaller than I expected but they were still good. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato aioli they used, but that's just me being picky. My girlfriend got the Ronin Burger and I ordered the bahn mi burger. The timing burger was good and the Japanese coleslaw on top was a nice touch, but like I said before nothing I haven't had backhome in the Bay Area. Now I'm a huge fan of banh mis and I felt like this burger would be \"the one\" for me. Unfortunately it felt a bit flat in that regard. While it was delicious it felt as if it were lacking something (that something TBD). 

I would still be more than happy to come back as there was a lot more than burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"We love this place and always bring out-of-town friends and family. Hands down they have the best burgers in Las Vegas. Our favorites are the Shogun (with foie gras!) and perfectly seasoned Banh Mi burger. Also go for the Ox tail chili fries and the Pork belly buns.

What impressed us more during our last visit is that they've expanded their menu. Must try are the North Shore Shrimp Truck (if you've ever been to Oahu and tried the shrimp trucks, you will know what this is about) and the Bone marrow jam (long bone cut longitudinally in half for you to scrape out the marrow's fatty goodness). 

Just so happy with this place. So many things to enjoy on the menu. Haven't even mentioned ramen menu from Shoku Ramen Ya which used to have its own entrance."}
{"text":"Am I lame for saying this was my most looked forward to place during my weekend Vegas getaway? At least it didn't disappoint! Unfortunately, this was a forced meal - as in, we came here on our way out of Vegas hungover af and not even hungry. But we ordered a lot of food anyway... For the two of us, we got the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork belly steamed buns, and the shogun burger. 

Oxtail chili cheese fries $11.50: This was really good! The chili was heavy in taste (good for the chili but can't say I know what oxtail tastes like) but I wish there was more cheese. Definitely a plate to be shared.

Pork belly steamed buns $10: Very Asian tasting (good thing obviously)! The glaze on the pork belly is sweet (how it's supposed to be). Comes with three, definitely share this too!

Shogun burger $26: The grand finale... The major components were wagyu beef, unagi (eel), and foie gras. There were no doubt LOTS of flavors but my bf thought it was too much. He wasn't a big fan of the unagi (but I was!). My issue with the burger was that it was way too oily. The combination of two days worth of alcohol and the greasiness of the burger (with the fries and pork belly too) was just too much for me to handle. I definitely had a stomach ache for the rest of the day - not that I'm blaming Bachi Burger. Was it worth $26? Mm I don't think so. I really like foie gras (bf is French) so putting it inside the burger was a bit of a waste to me. Though it did taste really good when I bit into it separately.

Anyway, great place to try! I'd definitely come again when I'm around."}
{"text":"I have come here for some time and love the Kalbi Burger but they have opened for breakfast and I have been here every week for the past month. The wild mushroom hash is to die for today guava pancakes and wake it up breakfast see photos. The pancakes are light fluffy and the guava flavor with coconut syrup are to die for.   The wake it up breakfast has sundries tomatoes garlic confit scallion and Gruyere cheese I recommend the fingerling potatoes with this dish.  By far the best breakfast I have ever had in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Ingredients are top quality.  Perfectly cooked and the sweet Asian flavors work great on the burgers...and I usually get the \"boring\" lettuce and tomato burger. I have dreams about the amazing truffle fries and my mouth is watering now thinking about them."}

I have visited many time and have yet to have decent service. hard to get refills and forget about the server coming back  to check on you once you have the food, except to bring you the bill!

Worth the food, not the service!"}

{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  It is a bit pricy but it's so worth it!  The oxtail chili cheese fries are AMAZING (and huge for an appetizer).  I've tried several burgers here but the Ronin burger is my favorite.  They also have a pretty decent beer selection for such a small place.  The last time we were there they had set up tables out on the patio so I'm looking forward to that during the summer!  This is a must visit if you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is for the quality of service. 
Not sure if it was just a bad night or what but the service was HORRIBLE! Long wait time from the time we ordered until we actually received our order. Took approximately 20-30 mins.

Despite the fact that they were super busy and short staffed, our server took excellent care of us, the manager stopped by and made sure everything was good on several occasions and since the kitchen accidentally over cooked our patties they remade our burgers and comped one of our beers and brought us a free shake (which was amazing!). Talk about service! Very happy. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Their burgers are freaking yummy!  We were such fatties that we had to order a little of everything!
We started with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  They were delish, we scarfed that down within minutes.  We then moved onto the Pork Belly Buns, one order comes with 3.  These were good, but weren't to die for.  Then on to the main course...Kiki burger and Miyagi-san burger, they were both so yummy!!! I'm just sad that I couldn't finish my portion of the Miyagi-san.  
Why the 4 stars you may ask...They seemed a little under staffed that day.  The staff was really friendly and attentive, but everything was a little slow. I'm sure the service would be amazing, if they had maybe another person on the floor.
I'll be back to sink my teeth into another burger!"}
{"text":"Came in to try this place out for the first time. Got seated within 15mins so the wait isn't bad. Food was delicious but why three stars? It's because of their vverryy .......... slooowwww service. Yes, food is important but the service is JUST as important. I shit you not, it took an hour to receive our burgers. I wasn't too upset because I'm chill af but my point is it shouldn't take an hour to get our meal. For those who do wish to try this place out, be sure you have atleast an hour to waste. Other than that, I'll try a different location."}
{"text":"Very solid burger. I wanted to give this place 5 stars but they were out of brussel sprouts, chocolate, and a wine we ordered (though there were good other options). 

The meal itself was very good and came out quickly. It was pretty empty on a Saturday night which was a little ominous to begin the meal but the chef didn't disappoint us. Our party tried the wagyu, angus, and veggie burger patties accompanied with various condiments. We also tried the sweet potato fries. 

I thought the wagyu was exceptional Anne the angus very good. The veggie was just ok but then again I'm not usually a fan of veggie patties. The fries were crispy and exceptional.  They had a solid beer menu as well. 

I would come back to Bachi as the menu is very extensive and will cost you under $20 for a quality higher end burger. Hopefully they have everything we want in stock next time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Vegas!!! Well it's quite the drive off the strip, but it's worth it.

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are one of those creations that are made to blow your minds away. You take one bite and your eyes will light up. You eat that oxtail and you can't even tell it is even ox. It just melts away in your mouth. If you saw all of us eating this dish you would think we were a pack of wild animals. In a blink of an eye it was all gone. It was just that good.

I tried the Ronin and the Kiki's Burger and they were excellent! There is so much going on with each burger. Each one gives unique flavors in every bite. You get something sweet, something salty, bitter, citrus, soft, crunchy... savor every bite because once it is gone you'll be wanting more.

My friends got the Shogun Burger and he wouldn't share it with anyone. It was worth $25 so I can understand why, but man I wish I had a chance to taste that perfect looking burger. Guess I know what to get when I come back."}
{"text":"The Kiki burger seemed to be the most popular so I decided to try it. This burger was cooked perfectly. It was very juicy and good sized. The carmalized onions add the perfect flavor and texture. And the sauce had a nice bite. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just fantastic.  We are from Tennessee and just moved into the neighborhood.   Everything we ordered was delicious.   We had burgers and calamari, but I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I will start with the good and end on the bad. The food was awesome our server was great even when annoying large parties were asking her to take their pictures while she was trying to work. Only warning was my husband does not like spicy and I did not see anything that would indicate that Garlic fries were spicy however I could have missed it as we were starving. now the bad. We arrived with a party of 5 and were quoted a 20 minute wait. Multiple small parties were put in front of us and the Hostess would disappear often while we waited once for almost 10 minutes. Finally 45 minutes later we were seated. Normally we would have left before 45 minutes but we were starving and it was far off the strip so we knew anywhere else would not have the same quality of food."}
{"text":"Good burger if your in the mood to wait for it, ox tail chili cheese fries are a must!  Service is mediocre at best
 @Joseph I'm a returning customer but the service issue I have is that it always seems under staffed. 
I feel I'm waiting for service but I don't feel like I'm waiting on the food. Waiting for someone to get to the table  , refill your drink,  if you need something in between , waiting for the check has been my issues every time I have returned."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors and fusions however pricey for a burger place.
Highly recommend any of their burgers; even their basic burgers - fish and chicken sandwiches.
You can't go wrong.
They now have three locations and I'm sure all of them of good no matter what!
No ka oi locals boys from Oahu !"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bachi Burger. I was impressed by the friendly staff and the customer service. The waiter was very knowlegeable, friendly and efficient. We visited on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy, but not overly crowded. We were seated in timely fashion and the waiter was there for drink orders quickly. The food was unique and very tasty.  I think it was a little pricy, as my thirteen dollar burger did not include fries which were an additional charge. Forty-one dollars for lunch for two without alcohol or appetizers is a little on the high side for me, however the side orders of french fries were probably big enough for two to split. I would have rated four stars had it not been for the leak in the ceiling that we were seated under. When we brought the leak to the hostess's attention, she responded with \"well, we've had problems with that in the past\"."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on triple d I HAD to try it.

First stop after a 6 hour bus ride? Bachi Burger, man they didn't disappoint. 

Started with the Oxtail chili fries. Incredible! Melt in our mouth oxtail meat chili over crisp fries, top with an over easy egg and freshly cut jalapenos. A little bit on the sweet side, but almost bought another one it was so good.

For my burger I went with the Banh Mi Burger. Quite delicious. Thick beef and shrimp patty topped with Vietnamese Greens and pickled radish/carrot. There is also a Vietnamese dipping sauce which is quite nice. All served on an awesome toasted bun.

My other friend got the Shogun Burger which could be possibly the best burger of all time. Nice slice of foie gras, unagi, waygu patty, all on that same awesome toasted bun.

You want to do Vegas right? Start at Bachi Burger, its a slam dunk!"}
{"text":"Asian-fusion burgers? So many types of fries? And vegetarian/vegan options? Count me in.

We were told about this place by our local friends. We ordered all the different types of fries, brussel sprouts, wings, and our burgers. I had a vegetable sandwich.

Fries were very good. Truffle fries were only as good as the porcini sauce it comes with. Brussel sprouts were not bad and a welcome change from the rest of the grease-laden food there. Wings were too sweet for my friends' likings.  My vegetable sandwich wasn't too bad and was pretty flavorful. Fixing are piled on top of the burger high. 

Cool place, cool concept, food could use a few adjustments, but worth visiting."}
{"text":"Not what it cracked up to be.  

Our orders (2 adults & 2 kids sharing):

Oxtail  Chili  Cheese  Fries:  Overrated.  Not that flavorful.

Kalbi Burger:  Saltiest thing I have ever eaten.  Only managed to eat less than half of the burger and needed a full glass of water to wash them down.

Miyagi san's  Grass  Fed  Wagyu  Burger:  It's pretty good, just not $13 good for a burger.

Pork belly steamed bun:  The best dish we had out of the whole order."}
{"text":"Great service from Crystal, even though we showed up at 9:30 and they close at 10.  We both had the veggie burgers, order of garlic fries, Thai iced tea, and the calamari appetizer.  The thai basil sauce for the calamari was the highlight...crazy good!!  The prices may be considered a little high, but the quality is there and I have no problem paying for it.  We will definately be going back"}
{"text":"Best burger in Las Vegas. First time to bring my family here and will be back."}
{"text":"*I don't usually write reviews.  But for this place I had to.

**Good (albeit extremely over-priced) food vastly offset by TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE that runs on Filipino time.

First thing I did when I moved to Vegas was check out all the burger reviews/joints/best-of-lists.  You'll see In N' Out, Burger Brassiere, LBS, Burger Bar...  and Bachi Burger.  So I had to check it out.

When I arrived there, there was a wait and I was hungry so I figured I'd just order To-Go.  I ordered two burgers (Kiki Burger & their Special at the time w/ blue cheese) and two fries (sweet potato & parmesan truffle).  Simple order?  I thought so.

Like the reasonable prudent person, I asked how long it would take.  Melissa let me know that it would be 15 minutes.  15 minutes sounds reasonable, right?  That is if it were really 15 minutes.

So after waiting for more than 30 minutes (I timed it) and giving a dozen different looks into the kitchen/Melissa, I asked politely how much longer would I have to stay hungry.  \"Three minutes\", she replied.  \"What a completely arbitrary number?\" I thought.  But I'll trust her.  

So 10 minutes later, wondering if I was high because it didn't feel like three minutes, I asked again how long it would take.  I think she finally started to feel guilty, so she said it was coming right up.  I'm so gullible.

So five minutes later, magically as I approached they started bagging my food.  It took another five minutes to finish bagging me up (they forgot my sauce) and ring me up.  

Because I was far beyond annoyed after waiting for so long when I was told 15 minutes, I asked if I could express my unpleasant experience and offer constructive  criticism to the owner/manager/person-in-charge.  Melissa told me he's not there and she's in charge.  Great.  She told me to just call later and the owner would talk to me.

So I called later...  In fact, I called later multiple times and on multiple days.  I left messages.  Nothing.  He never talked to me. 

Don't get me wrong, food was good.  But spending $32.43 and waiting more than 50 minutes for 2 burgers & 2 fries is not justifiable in any sense unless I was told from the get-go what to expect.  Instead I was lied to repeatedly, never apologized to or compensated, and was not even able to express my displeasure to those who count.  Arrghh... Just thinking about it makes me so angry.  Like a big emo tornado of emotion.  Thank God for In N' Out. 

Peace Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"I love this place and seen it on Food Network before I moved here from NY. The first meal I ever ate when I moved to Vegas was at Bachi Burger. And now I visit it atleast once a month. The Pork Belly buns are so good with the hoison sauce on the side and I always get the Miyagi San Burger with the fried egg and Onion ring on it and it is nothing short of spectacular in my onion and nice and juicy. I also love their truffle fries which I usually order. The service is very friendly and. If you want a good burger with an Asian twist you definitely need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Always awesome.  Ramen is good not amazing.  Burgers are my favorite there.  Always get the Kiki burger and truffle fries."}
{"text":"The 45 minute wait was worth it. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had, plus great sweet potato and truffle garlic fries. The unique dipping sauces they offer are fantastic. Try the Black And Green burger. So freakin good."}
{"text":"I'm kind of upset that I ate here, now that I know how good it is, I want to go back as soon as possible!  And I'm not sure my waist line needs it.  The servers were friendly and on top of things.  We had a cobb salad to start that was large and delicious and then we had two burgers and a side of salt and pepper garlic fries.  I can't tell you what was my favorite but we finished every bite.  I had the Kiki burger, mushrooms, gruyere, sweet onion marmalade and caramelized bacon.  After the first bite on this fluffy bun with so many delicious, perfectly balanced ingredients, I got really excited.  It was so perfectly balanced, well cooked, and juicy.  The boy got the spicy miso burger which was just as good!  The fries were absurd.  Everything was good.  Try as many things as possible.  We even got some donuts for dessert that were delicious.  Try the Vietnamese coffee at the end of the night with the sweetened condensed milk.  yum.  yum.  Not sure what else to say, I wish I could go back tonight!"}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries are amazeballs, got the kikis burger, even more amazeballs, great food, great environment, can't wait to come back and try it again"}
{"text":"So it's spring break vacation time and we decided to take our son to Las Vegas. We saw Bachi Burgers on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives and decided to give it a go. 

We'll let me tell you...best decision ever made! Man, the burgers here are awesome. If you check out their menu, you will see that a majority of their burgers and foods are Asian infused. I ordered the kalbi burger which has some Vietnamese touches such as the kalbi beef marinade and the kimchi inside the burger. I also ordered their truffle parmesan fries, which were so addictive! Service was good. We didn't have to wait that long to be seated even though it was packed when we arrived. Staff were friendly and very informative when it came to the menu options. 

There was a ramen restaurant next door that Bachi Burgers ended up combining with. Now you can order burgers or even ramen. What better choices could you have? Ramen and a burger! Amazing! If you're in the Las Vegas area, you have to give this place a try!! They have two locations, one in downtown Las Vegas and this one."}
{"text":"Dined here for a weekend dinner with a friend before a movie.  Upon arrival we were seated right away and restaurant was busy, but service was good.  Server gave ample time to review menu and answered all our questions.  My friend ordered The Lonely Bird and I got a Kalbi Burger.  I love how you can order protein style without bread.  Water cups were kept full.  We enjoyed meal so much even stayed for dessert which included coffee ice cream and doughnuts which was great to share.  We made it to movie on time and dinner was super good!"}
{"text":"I am salivating thinking about the Galbi Burger. The gochuragu sauce went perfectly inside the juicy burger and the size of the burger was just right for a hungry person. The side of cold pickled cucumbers... yum! We also got the parmesan truffle fries as well and it was good. 
Minus one star for the wait. But to be honest, I'd go wait in that line again."}
{"text":"the kiki burger is awesome.
so many *unqiue* burger choices you really can't go wrong.. i'm sure you will find your favorite.
decor is nice, service was good when i went."}
{"text":"They gave me exactly what I expected. I realized this morning searching for breakfast in a town that isn't awake before 10 that I never praise the establishments that give me exactly what I was expecting.
The wagyu burger was awesome, perfect temp"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Everything I've tried is worthy of having again.  The Ronin burger, the crab cake burger, the truffle fries... dreams are made of this kind of food.  Service is always good, never have had to wait long for a table and if you eat at Bachi for lunch, you're not really hungry for the rest of the day.  The buns are soooo good!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was killer. By far the best burger I have ever had in my life. I had the Miyagi sans wagyu burger. It was amazing. I can't wait to go back. I also tried the truuffle parmesan fries. There good but I didn't love them. This place was so worth just for the burger though."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always. Our server Mindy was the BEST.  Smiled the whole time and gave us great service.  She made our visit even better than usual."}
{"text":"Short, sweet and to the point. That'll be my review (at least, I'll try). Not the actual experience.

Let's get the inevitable bad part out of the way now. Service:

Overall, not very good at all. I won't blame the wait staff, but will wholeheartedly blame the management. Obviously properly scheduling staff is not a required skill when applying for a managerial position there and that lack of restaurant 101 expertise results in a devastating cascading effect on quality of service.
Too few waiters = lots of empty tables = long wait before getting seated = very long time before server acknowledge you = past the point of dehydration before any water on table = alcohol withdrawals symptoms creep up before getting chance to order any drinks = you have whole menu memorized by heart before server finally take your order = hunger pain substitute for the tremors caused by the earlier lack of alcoholic content in our bloodstream = you sob with joy when your much anticipated meal is being displayed before your teary eyes.

There was very little happiness and smiles, just busy waiter bees trying to catch up, no team effort. It all comes back to bad training and no business culture.

Food:
I have to be fair and can't really complain about my own stupidity defying common sense of food pairing. So, I'll refrain from any negativity until I try again in the future.
See, what I did, was a giant \"fusion-nouvelle-burger cuisine\" faux pas. I dared to customize my options with elements that probably did not compliment each other and  it took away the taste of the meat. Next time, I will order without customization and render a proper food review.

3 last important notes:

1) Do not order the Kobe option if you plan to have various condiments, sauce, etc. Kobe beef burgers are meant for burger purists and cooked rare to medium rare and not meant to be overwhelmed by options. You'd waste your hard earned money as chances are that condiments and toppings would overpower the beef's taste.

2) Fries are good and options are tempting, but in most cases the toppings are also too sparse to make a huge difference. Maybe ask for extra to make a difference.

3) Website: Don't bother, It doesn't work very well and is the least informative. You can't see the menu because Mr. Webmaster decided to be creative with flash, yet failed to deliver basic needs for information.

Sorry for breaking my promise to make a short, sweet and to the point review."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Bachi Burger.  

Food: I've been here a couple of times and there is still not a burger that I would call my favorite or go-to burger.  All of the burgers are over $10 and they are cooked with a lot of unique Asian ingredients.  I recently had the Banh Mi inspired burger and it came with a fish sauce to dip in.  It was pretty good.  I had one in the past that was served on a purple taro bun.  Very interesting.  Sometimes I feel that there is so much going on in the burger that I kinda get lost in all the tastes trying to decipher the flavors.   I do love their oxtail chili cheese fries though.  Skinny fries slathered with soft oxtail meat and chili.  There is a crapload of scallions and a sunny side egg on top.  Delicious!

I usually come when we have visitors from LA and need to take them somewhere that will satisfy everyone, LA loves their asian fusion burgers and tacos lol.  (FYI They are building a Bachi Burger on Sawtelle in LA!)  It is kinda pricy to just come here to pick up a burger but it is a crowd pleaser.  

My main gripe is there is often a long wait and a lot of tables available.  This kinda angers me and other people have experienced this problem too!  Fill your restaurant and don't tease me with empty tables that you don't plan on using."}
{"text":"WOW!  This was our first stop as soon as we arrived in Vegas.  I'm a big Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives fan.  I saw this place featured on one of the episodes. The service and food was amazing.  The manager actually chatted with us several times from behind the bar.  He gave us a couple of good recommendations on the beers they sold. Our server also provided great recommendations.  Great vibe. We ordered the spicy miso burger, the banh mi burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. OMG!  All were so tasty!    Highly recommend all of these items.  It was go good that we stopped by for another meal before heading back to Southern Cali."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 4 stars because their burgers are expensive, but I guess that's what you pay for quality burgers.  Their oxtail chilli cheese fries are to die for!  They have a great selection of fries too.  Very unique burger joint."}
{"text":"Good quality Asian flavor burgers.

The Banh Mi burger ($11) was pretty amazing but you gotta like the banh mi flavors to begin with. The Ronin burger ($11) wasn't doing it for me. It's a bit too sweet for my taste.

The truffle parmesian fries ($5.5) were good.
Kurobuta sausages with honey basil mustard ($7). Wish it was just plain mustard. 

I also had the lychee apple soda ($4). Tasted like club soda mixed with Monin syrup. Would not order it again.

Service was good.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I'm not much of a burger person (unless it's In-N-Out or Whataburger), but I'd eat here again--and that's saying A LOT! The atmosphere is club/lounge-like, which is cool in my book. I would have given the place 5 stars, but the bartender guy was just a tiny bit rude. Other than that, excellent food & great service from the waitress that served us. Btw, we waited about 25 minutes for a table at 7pm on a Saturday, which was okay, and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"ox tail fries were amazing, customer service was great, the meat was cooked on point for a medium well done"}
{"text":"DAMN GOOD BURGER! I got the Kiku burger, full of all sorts of mushrooms and it was LARGE and DELICIOUS. 

Got the oxtail chili cheese fries too. They were delicious, and would probably rank 3rd on my all-time list of garbage plate fries. The one thing that hold them back are that the fries themselves are really simple, but this is pretty typical of chili cheese fries. The waiter said we wouldn't be able to finish a whole order of fries and our burgers...how wrong he was. We frickin destroyed our entrees!

The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are currently #3 on my Garbage Plate Fries list"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the oxtail chili fries and I had the Miyagi-San

The fries were great, especially coming from a person who doesn't normally like oxtail.

The burger was the best I've ever had.  The blend of flavor was to die for.

I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is the go to spot when you want to spoil yourself with a really delicious and unique burger!  I don't do this very often, in fact I would never order a burger for $26!  Well Never say never! Today, my daughter was just as intrigued with the Shogun burger as I so we decided to satisfy our curiosity and see what all the hype was about...we agreed it was very tasty but not ever having eaten pâté we decided that would opt for something a little more tame next time.  The fries were tasty!  Bottom line:  Good service, good food and prompt, friendly service."}
{"text":"The Shogun Burger was sooo good!! Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach; all came together so well."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I visited this place.  Today has been a day of ordering food to go. I had the Oxtail chili cheese fries (super delicious) and the spicy miso burger...the burger consisted of Angus beef, onions, Shishito Peppers, fried egg, lettuce, roasted garlic, Swiss cheese, and mayo. The burger was cooked perfectly and had the fresh taste when we got it home."}
{"text":"So we arrived to vegas a bit late and craved burgers. I've heard good things about bachi burgers and the pictures have always made me drool. Finally we got to try it and I wasn't disappointed!

I'm not sure why so many people had such bad service, but we must've came on a good night. The service was great for us and the guy was really funny. 

Truffle Parmesan Fries - Definitely loaded w/ black truffle flavor! It was enough to share between the 4 of us. Nice and crispy, not oily at all

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Their most popular item, presented beautifully! The over easy egg on top made everything delicious. Again, fries were cooked perfectly crispy, but I do wish they added more oxtail. Not that the fries were bad, but I actually prefer the truffle fries.

Shogun Burger - $25 for a burger?! My bf ordered this and I got to steal 1/4 of it. It sounded like the ultimate most delicious burger ever w/ all the ingredients listed: wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, peach YUMM. Unfortunately though the flavors were all lost in translation to me. The only thing I could taste the whole time was the unagi...This burger isn't worth $25 imo

Kiki burger - I love shrooms! (I know it's vegas, but I'm talking about food here people not the other kind of shroom lol) There were 3 kinds of mushrooms in this burger: shiitake, enoki, and eryngii. Instead of angus beef, I paid extra to get the wagyu beef patty. The caramelized bacon and mushrooms made the burger stand out. This was my 2nd favorite burger

Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - My 2nd favorite burger!! Again, that fried egg w/ the oozing yolk made this burger taste its best. The crispy onions & furikake added the extra oomph to it. For first timers I would recommend getting this to start!

Spicy Miso burger - It's not spicy at all. The burger wasn't bad, but flavors didn't pop or stand out compared to Kiki & Miyagi-San.

The patties here were all requested to be cooked medium rare and they came out good/juicy. I really like the taiwanese sweet buns here which makes the burgers unique. However, after trying Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in PH, I believe the burgers there are a lot better. I wouldn't mind coming back though next time I'm in vegas and craving asian fusion burgers"}
{"text":"Wagyu Beef at it's best.  I came here with my hubby and my mom last August.  We've been wanting to try Bachi Burger but never had the chance to.  The place is really big but does not seem to have enough people to staff it.  There's always a wait when there are tables available in plain sight.  Aside from that, this place rocks.

We ordered a happy hour serving of the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  It's so unique that it has fried egg on top.  It was really delicious. My husband and I devoured the whole thing in minutes.  My mom ordered sweet potato fries, which was good.  The happy hour menu also had the option for sliders.  My mom got it, she does not like sweet things and this burger was sweet so we switched food.  I got the Black & Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sautéed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, and Roasted Garlic.  The burger was good but seems to be a little on the bland side.  My husband ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings.  This one was a clear winner!  The flavor combination was just amazing.  It was not too salty, not too greasy, it was just perfect!  I'm coming back here to get a Miyagi-san for myself and have more of the Oxtail Chili Fries.  We've seen a lot of tables ordering the Bao Sandwiches.  I will have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger...I'm a huge fan. This is one of my favorite places for gourmet burgers. 
My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth. 

We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries. 

Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.

The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead."}
{"text":"Well, finally after nearly a year or so the wife and I just had dinner at Bachi Burger. Very good overall and we'll be back for sure. I had the Kalbi Burger and wife had the Ronin (first one on the menu). When the burgers came we cut our burgers in half and tasted 1/2 of each. I took a bite of the Ronin and it was just great! I wil have it again. The Kalbi burger was good too, but the Kim Chee essense kind of threw the taste off a bit (and I am Korean too). The hamburger meat is a 10 on the quality scale, this ain't no $1 McDs burger, no no no. Their bun should be the standard for all hamburger buns, it is just a light carrier for the meat and doesn't overpower the other flavors, but not to say it is just a piece of bread either. The sweet potato fries were excellent and so was the regular fries, BUT once again I have a pet peave over those thin shoestring fries, I just never liked them. When I want a french fry, give me a huge steak frie, not those little shoelace fries. The dipping sauces were cute and tasty. Pineapple ketchup was ok, but not my favorite, the wasabi mayo tasting one for the sweet potato fries is much better. All in all a great place and very comfortable and casual. I did my homework and expected a long wait for my burger to come out, but it didn't take but 10 minutes or so. Service is decent and since they've been open a while they seem to have their act together. There are plenty of other selections to choose from and we'll be back to try them again!"}
{"text":"Good food, saw it on Diner's, Drive N and Dives, food was very good, alot of different flavors. Oxtail chili fries must try, Sweet Tea Plantation must have \"no more refills\" but cup is huge but you won't be disappointed if you had to pay for anther one. Med Rare   burgers, awesome, been back two times  now, from our Vegas trip."}

I had the Mr. Miyagi burger. WOW. just WOW. the toppings, the beef, everything was just divine. One of the best burgers of my life."}
{"text":"My coworker had been telling me about Bachi Burger for a couple months prior to my trip to Vegas, so I made a point to stop by for lunch since we had a rental car this trip. We went to their location on Sahara Ave, which is a 20-25 minute drive from the Strip, and kind of in the middle of nowhere. Their other location is closer to the Strip, but much busier. This location didn't have a wait at all (we went on a Tuesday around 11:30am), so we were seated right away and placed our order quickly. We tried:

The buns were nice and fluffy, and held up to the pork belly well. I loved how all the ingredients worked together in this dish- highly recommended!
-Shogun Burger (Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach, $26, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw#lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw): There are a LOT of ingredients in this burger, and most of them work really well together. However, you really had to smush the burger down to get the whole burger in one bite. I think there would be less clash in the flavors if you took out the unagi and peach, but I just took my pieces out and ate those separately. Although I enjoyed trying this burger (and the richness of the foie gras), I wouldn't order this again since it was too flavorful for me. 

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch at Bachi Burger, and it was a nice change from always dining at a place on the Strip. They have a very extensive burger menu as well as Asian influenced snack type dishes, so I would love to come back and try other items/burgers. The parking lot at this plaza is big, so you should be able to find a spot easily."}
{"text":"The Black & Green Wagyu Beef Burger was everything that I hoped it would be.  Juicy.  Flavors that truly did evolve with each bite.  The bleu cheese, bacon, and mushrooms played nicely with each other.  I was thinking about building my own burger, but for my first visit, I thought it was a safer choice to go with something that their chefs created, which is what I recommend you do as well, if you're a first timer.  The Peking Duck Bao's were awesome as well.  The Bao was so soft and fluffy, and the sweet hoisin-like sauce was perfect with them.  I saved the Ox Tail Chili Fries for last, as they were the most surprising to me.  I expected everything to be great here, but these awesome fries had me feeling some type of way!  Keep in mind, I had already devoured my big burger, and had some Duck Bao's, and I couldn't stop eating the Ox Tail Chili Fries.  The Ox Tail meat is shredded and mixed into the chili, which has a semi-sweet flavor.  The egg, sriracha mayo type sauce, jalapenos, and cilantro created this perfect combination of flavors, and this will now be ordered every time I come here.  The ambiance was nice.  Their staff was tentative, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Bottomline:  Food is inconsistent, wait times are ridiculous, and service was painfully slow, yet kind.

I have been following this place for awhile now but I've never gotten a chance to try it until now.  We had a party of 9 and waited an hour for our table...even though they could have pushed together a couple of tables.  What's worse was that our food took another 45 minutes to arrive.  Kitchen was backed up like a constipated monster. 

Here's a breakdown of the food:

Oxtail fries - Woooahh there.  They need to ease up on the sugar in this \"chili\" oxtail sauce because it was as sweet as Kate Upton's Dougie.  The fries came out nice and crisp however.

Truffle Parmesan fries - These were pretty good but they should really call it a poutine instead.  The brown gravy on it was amazingly tasty but...where is the truffle flavor? The dipping sauce they give you was good...but it's just mayo and sirracha. 

Miso Burger with extra patty - I ordered medium rare and it came out perfect.  The juice was flowing and the sauce was tasty.

Miyagi Burger - Ordered medium on this guy and it came out well done.  Should have sent this back because it was almost inedible.  How can you possibly overcook a burger this much? FAIL.

The waitress asked us if we wanted dessert and we all replied with a quick no...we really didn't feel like waiting another hour for our food.

To sum it up, the food is decently priced because the burgers are huge and are very tasty...IF cooked properly.  Service was S-L-O-W, from the waitstaff to the waiters to the kitchen.

3 SLOW stars."}
{"text":"They need to count their blessings! The burgers are amazing but every time I go the service gets worse and worse! It's like they can't come up with anything else...ever! Waited 30 minutes for our server to get me the napkin I asked for, I was looking like boo boo the fool with sauce all over my face."}
{"text":"This place lived up to my expectations. Quick attentive service. Ordered the Miyagi-San Burger.

WOW

Cooked perfect medium rare. And a burger with bacon, onion rings and a fried egg is LEGIT!!!"}
{"text":"Once again, Bachi burger does not disappoint! Today we had the sweet potato fries to start, then the chef's special: Spicy Miso Burger and the Lonely Bird burger. 

I almost want to retract my previous review of the Ronin being the Death Row burger. The spicy miso burger is definitely a knife-and-forker. The lonely bird was a picker-upper and held it's own. I swear everytime I come here and think that I had already tried the best burger, something new proves me wrong. Never a dull moment in the food adventure at Bachi Burger. Thanks to Melissa our server today for the recommendation! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries!!! I always come back just for these alone. The burgers are incredible as well. Service is usually hit or miss, this last time wasn't the best but the food makes up for it. Will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"i'm not sure how well known Bachi Burger is to the locals, but being from out of town, i'd like to think this place as a hidden gem. 

i've been here twice and have yet to be dissappointed in the quality of food here. Burgers with a Asian twist in a pretty contemporary setting. i've had the Ronin, tried a bite of the Kiki, and the Kalbi. though, i only had a bite, i think the Kiki is amazing.... definitely wished i had order the whole burger. there orders do take a little while for them to make, as it's made to order. i look forward to the next time i go to vegas, so i can try a new burger from their interesting selection. 

Sunday lunch at Bachi is the perfect way to end a Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a unique twist on burgers and fries. Only here can you get a milk tea, Japanese chicken skewers and a burger and have it all be wonderful."}
{"text":"Let me get a napkin and wipe my drool as I'm salivating. 

BACHI?  Do you know what BACHI means?  You going BACHI yourself... 
Bachi is commonly used in Hawaii because of the strong influence of the Japanese culture.  (Go research it for yourself and don't bachi yourself.)

Bachi Burger offers  burgers with an Asian twist.

People complained about service but our server was absolutely great and always kept my water filled.  

Food: 
Sweet potato fries with aioli sauce
Pork Belly Steamed Buns
Miyag-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger

The food was delicious.  What a great concept of Asian themed burgers.  
They seem to be expanding and I hope one day they'll be in San Diego or Hawaii. 
A little pricey but to me it's worth it."}
{"text":"While the service could be dramatically improved, the food here is hands down the best!! The burgers are amazing!  The homemade onion rings are their best kept secret.  I have been here several times already!"}
{"text":"The steamed pork buns are so tender and the spicy miso ramen was good! I love the matcha green tea, however. I didn't try a burger. That's on my to do list next time."}
{"text":"Road Trip with LT:

OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES!

After a hot pocket, mcdonald's french fries and chicken nuggets, cuties and trader joe's salt and vinegar chips on the ~4.5 hour drive to Las Vegas we still had room for Bachi Burger. 

Met up with my cousin and friend (who live in LV), they suggested the meatball spot/place at Town Square but I really wanted to go to Bachi Burger, so they met up with us there. :)

While waiting for them, we perused the pictures on the yelp app and decided we HAD to get the oxtail chili cheese fries. 

We also shared the kiki burger, which was good but nothing to write home about.
My cousin talked about this one drink they have that has like a burnt marshmallow on it, and when we asked the waitress about it she raved about it, sadly they only have it at their other location. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

Their dessert menu is limited, my friend was craving mochi and the girl said we could go next door. Haha

Overall, Bachi burger is still satisfying..excited that they're opening one in LA! (David G. said so!)

After checking in, taking a nap, and gambling we went to eat again! LOL just a slice of pizza. well most of it."}
{"text":"Asian-ized burgers - cool concept, pretty good execution.  Thick, juicy burger patties glazed in some kind of terriyaki or soy sauce.

I preferred the Kiki burger (lots of mushrooms) over the Ronin (didn't like the pickled ginger).

The parmesan truffle shoestring fries were thin and crispy - not bad, but couldn't really taste any truffle.

Overall, not a bad value and it makes a good stopping point before checking into your hotel."}
{"text":"We came on a weeknight, and there was a substantial wait to be seated. We sat at the bar, and again waited more than 20 minutes before the waitress came and took our order for drinks.  Once we were seated, we ordered oxtail fries appetizer. It was without a doubt outstanding.  We ate every last bite!  We ordered burgers and the pork belly sliders. Everything was outstanding and flavorful and delicious! The service staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended it to me and we went to the location on West Sahara Avenue and it was delicious! This location was closer but still the service was great and food was on point. All the burgers have their own special taste. We had to pace ourselves. Their ketchup is something you have to try as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Really great food, a little different from your normal burger. The loaded fries were amazing!!!!  Big portions for a decent price. The server was knowledgeable and helpful. They seem to dig their job. Overall great impression, will go back whenever we are in Vegas.."}
{"text":"All of these stars are for food NOT for service ! They have a nice menu and food taste good and I definitely go back to try other menu items but they need to work on service. We got there and there was only few tables before us but we waited too long to get our food and then they missed part of our order  , maybe cause we didn't order much food and that's why they didn't care about us but there was a bigger party  arrived after us and seemed that they got a good service! We got a wagu burger which was seasoned and cooked perfectly, truffle fries had a nice sauce as well ! 
Well done kitchen staff !"}
{"text":"The plus part of this place is that the food was delicious. Everything the waiter recommended was tasty. The only down fall to this location is when I was told the waiter dipped his fingers in someone's boba drink to taste the flavor because he didn't know which flavor was what. Our first Bachi Burger experience just went down hill from there :( Amazing food but .... :("}
{"text":"This place is A-OK!   If you're looking for a good burger somewhere away from the strip, this is a good place to go.  I had really high expectations of this place based on the amount of reviews and pics they have on Yelp however their service and some of their food fell short of a 4 or 5 star rating.   

Food~ the burgers are very creative with loads of extra flavorful  additions like caramelized onions, cheeses, ox tail chili and various cheeses.  The extra favors are a bit much considering everything is piled onto an angus beef patty that is difficult to taste with everything else piled on.  A lot of people like these burgers, so give them a try!  

I also thing the truffle fries are over seasoned and like with their burger, it was difficult to taste the actual fry for all of the sodium and truffle sauce.  Again a lot of people like them.  I really like their sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Never wrote a review before but this place is so good I had to! The Oxtail chili cheese fries and a Kiki burger were the best! I've never been happier eating a restaurant burger. This place is a must if you're craving a burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service for high end price for burgers and fries. The Salt and pepper fried with the aioli dipping sauce were the star here."}
{"text":"I ordered the Miyagi-San and it was probably the best burger I ever had! The meat was perfectly medium rare, the egg was a perfect over-medium, the furikake bacon and onion rings were delicious. My favorite part, however, was the bun. Many places treat the bun as an afterthought. My bun was actually crispy on the inside and soft on the outside. Heaven. We ordered the plain fries to give us something new to try next time. And we will be back. My only regret is that I need to buy a plane ticket to get there."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Service is great! Not cheap but well worth it! Ambiance is great too!!"}
{"text":"Started off on a bad note b/c someone misquoted the wait time over the phone. With 6 pre-adolesecents in the party = not a happy mamma. I griped to the manager (Frank), who was incredibly patient, heard me out until I got my point across, and was still very apologetic and accommodating. (Thanks to Frank, our party of 12 was back on track.) Seated in 35 min - not what we were quoted but better than the 'up to 45' they quoted when we walked in.

Really enjoyed the food and the service was good. Tried the Spicy Miso burger, along with the Parmesian and Sweet Potato fries, and really enjoyed how flavorful the food was. (If you want it spicier, just ask for some sliced peppers.) Reminded me of bibimbap in the form of a burger. Everyone in our party was happy, esp my husband b/c they served Arrogant Bastard. We all marveled at how the buns reminded us of baos. 

Will definitely stop by again the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's taken me a long while to write a restaurant review on Yelp. 

Bachi Burger was able to inspire me to write one.

The theme of the day: \"Bachi Burger?  More like Bachitty Service Burger.\"

Here are some of the highlights:

We had a group of 12 people.  Plenty of room to sit. It took about 20 minutes to get seated.

It took 15 minutes for anyone to stop by our table.  That's when the busboy spilled water.  Which is no big deal, but he didn't wipe it after he spilled it.

10 minutes later we finally place orders.  I tell the waiter about the spill, the busboy comes back, wipes the water on the ground.  I tell him about the table, uses the same towel he wiped the floor with.

Gave 4 of us plates for the 4 orders of fries we got.  We had to flag another busser down, but we never got more plates.

Asked for napkins, never came.

Water is completely empty for half the table, they see it, we have to ask again for a refill.

Honestly, it's frustrating to write all of this.  It shouldn't take 2 hours to have a burger with your family.  It's a shame too because I thought the burger was pretty good.  I've just never seen such horrific service, and a failure to understand that bad service was being offered when it was clear as day.  There were too many workers there to not understand. Whyyyyy =*("}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS great.

Went back last week after restraining myself for MONTHS and saw a few new items.

My BF tried the Manga Burger and I had the Mr. Ho's.

I preferred my selection over his, but they are definitely very different!

The Mr. Ho's burger is perfection, with the lapcheong (Chinese Sausage), and taro bun! That screamed greatness off the menu! 

The Manga has a very subtle taste,still good,  but paled in comparison to the Mr. Ho's I had that was BURSTING with flavor. 

They've upped the portions on the fries, and somehow I believe the Garlic Salt & Pepper fries have been improved! Unless I just hadn't had them in very long. Regardless, the flavor is always on point.

We also had a chance to try their special dessert, the Grilled Mochi Sundae. We both loved it! The grilled mochi atop azuki (red bean) sauce and a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle with matcha powder sprinkled all over! Simple, but wonderful. 

I can't wait to go back in a few more months and hope they have more items added on to the menu!

Bachi never disappoints me.
oh, and rumor has it, they may be opening another location... shhhh..."}
{"text":"Forget about the fact that you'll be spending about $20 for a burger and fries.


It was Saturday night on the strip and craving a burger at around 11:15pm.


Not to worry, Bachi Burger is open til midnight on Saturdays.

So after a quick drive to an unsuspecting strip mall off Windmill, you'll find some unique gourmet-ish type burgers to kill that craving. It was my first time there so of course I had to have a burger but there are definitely some other things on the menu that I'd love to go back for and try ... like the chili fried chicken, pork buns or the oxtail chili cheese fries.


But I stuck with the plan and had the Miyagi San grass-fed Wagyu burger that had chili mayo,  fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. You pretty much feed any cows grass and you know that shit will taste delicious. 

I really can't tell the difference between the grass fed beef compared to others but the burger was damn tasty and I'd definitely come back to Bachi Burger when in LV even though it's off the strip.


So if you're craving a burger while in Sin City, haven't lost all your money gambling and drinking and have means of transportation to get here.


Give the place a try, just expect to overpay for a burger and fries but then remember again where you are.


Yup, LV."}
{"text":"My second time at Bachi after a friend told us it is a must try. Its not the best burger but definitely good. We had the oxtail chilli cheese fries which was a pretty big portion of yumminess in chunks of oxtail meat and chilli lathered over fries and an egg on top. The only thing i didnt like about it is that it was a tad sweet. We also had the truffle Parmesan fries which you can't go wrong with unless you're not a fan of truffle; however perhaps a bit more of that sauce would have made it even better. My boyfriend ordered the ronin and kiki burger. He ate half of each and describes it as \"hella good\". I had the wagyu San burger which was also very good. It was flavorful and each bite was juicy, tasty, and crunchy because of the onion rings. 

Ambience was good. I was glad I came at 11 on a weekday with no lines cause the last time I came on a weekend, we waited 45 mins. This new location is spacious, clean, and comfortable."}
{"text":"Succulent, savory and flavorful. Truly an awesome burger. I had the Miyag-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, medium rare with sweet potato fries. The fries were good but not particularly special. The burger is to die for. Best I've had in Vegas. Just be sure to pair it with a good beer like the  Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar."}
{"text":"[edit-- after subsequent trips back to this place and realizing that the cravings for bachi burger are never ending, I have bumped the rating from a 4 up to a 5. This place is one of a kind.]

This is not your typical burger. If you are craving a cut and dry, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on a salted angus patty with a slice of American cheese, go elsewhere. If you are a little more open minded and crave the satisfying structure of a burger with a new and unique spin, come on down to Bachi burger.

The wait wasn't too long for the two of us. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki burger and I the Kalbi burger. We shared some parmesean truffle fries which were ultra tasty and came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was perhaps one of the finest sauces I have ever tasted. They were cut thin like average fries but far from average in taste and quality. The burgers themselves arrived 15-20 minutes after ordering and were cooked medium rare as requested. The kiki burger featured sweet caramelized onions and three different kinds of asian mushrooms. My Kalbi burger came with a sweet korean bbq marinade, green onions and enough kimchi to give it a noticeable kick. It was blissful. The meat was juicy and plentiful, the marinade was not excessive or overpowering (although it did drip all over my hands and face) and the balance of the sweet with the spicy kimchi simply turned out to be a winning combination. I'm a man with a respectable appetite and upon finishing the burger and fries was thoroughly stuffed. I had the green tea to drink on the side.

We didn't try deserts or appetizers but we'll definitely be making a trip back here to see what other goodies this place has to offer. The bottom line is that Bachi burger offers a unique, Asian spin on the classic American burger with delicious results. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for a burger that is anything but fast food in quality. Burger fans and foodies alike-- you simply have to try it."}
{"text":"YUMMM. I love bachi burger! I live near here so I come here every time i get the chance. The last time i went, i had the oxtail chili cheese fries and the seasonal fois gras burger. WOW. The burger had the beef patty with fois gras and peaches! the mix of sweet and savory was wonderful. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of weeks ago and I got food poisoning! That sucked!
I will NEVER eat here again!!!
The food wasn't even worth getting sick from either."}
{"text":"High quality burgers with unique Asian flavor! The wagu is a must try as well at the fries with gravy! Gotta be in the mood for Asian themed burgers before you go"}
{"text":"Burgers here are unique and have the perfect combination of flavors. The wait and service is very slow though. The demand is just too high."}
{"text":"Great food and gotta give a shout out to Gem for amazing service, Kalbi burger was phenomenal and so was the Apple Lychee soda."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is a good gourmet burger place. Definitely one of a kind. Its a japanese-american fusion restaurant.

I definitely come here for the burger with foie gtas, yes you heard it right, BURGER WITH FOIE GRAS! This burger is so special that they give you a palate cleanser before you eat it. 

A must go to place when you're in las vegas!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite burger joint . Whenever I am in Vegas , i always make a stop to their summerlin location. Service has always been fast and friendly. Our server this time was really patient as we had a bigger group. This time I got to try the oxtail chili fries, which was a really good combo of spices and beef. The Banh mi burger reminded me of the sandwich was was perfect replica of flavors. This is a must try with lup chueng sausage! 

The pork belly steam buns are always the best appetizer, I highly recommend this. The hoisin sauce , am the egg and pork belly all flow together right ."}
{"text":"Packed on a Sunday - for two people - able to sit at the bar right away - service was prompt despite being busy - if you know what you want. Tried the Ox tail chilli cheese fries, the peking duck wrap sandwiches, and the green / black burger. Of these, the peking duck wrap was good but not as good as gourmet Chinese such as at Blossom - Aria Hotel, or my usual high end Vancouver BC Chinese restaurants. However, the burger was excellent and the oxtail chilli cheese fries were superb."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 4 stars because of the tasty flavors and efficient service. The meat was not that tender nor was it juicy at all....a little disappointing for spending 10 dollars for a burger. I enjoyed my experience, though..."}
{"text":"I am a fan! I have heard about Bachi Burger forever and was happy to see it and when I drove by, made a U turn!

The way I judge a burger is by the flavor of the meat. I cannot eat gluten so I do not get to have the joy of a bun, so when a burger is seasoned well it is a pleasure for the palate. Bachi Burger does it oh so right that I did not miss the bun. I was in heaven. We both ordered the Kiki Burger, and I wish one would have tried a different one but I now have a reason to return! The meat,the carmelized onions, mushrooms and cheese was pure decadence. I give the server props for letting me know the sauce was not gluten free! That was a touch I truly appreciated. I also liked that there was extra lettuce to make up for the bun, it is a great touch because it is annoying to pay the same for getting less. It was just juicy and oh so good.

We shared the oxtail fries. They were very good and the portion is very large. In fact, half came home. The meat was tender, flavorful and a nice kick. It was too spicy for my Mom even without the jalapeños but I was happy to finish them off. Next time if I ordered the fried it could be with another side as it was too much food! I want to try the other fries as well, so I will be returning'

I hear it is busy all the time, so as far as service goes I suggest not going at peak service as it is not large, so one may have to wait for excellence.The concrete floors and high ceiling makes it a little noisy but that is also the urban vibe. We had one main server but several different servers and busses came by to make sure we were taken care of!

The is one of the best burgers I have ever had, 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"It was the \"bomb\" of a burger.  I had the one with the unagi and it was worth the price. The bread/bun made it even better. It was a toasted sweet bread like. Im definite going back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.... Service was great .... Had a hamburger, tea, and some French fries.... Got the bill.. Over 25.00 for one person.... With tip.. Over 30.....hard to come back for the money... Totally recommend  the food, but hit the atm  prior to entering ...."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Maybe one of the best burgers I've ever had. I had Kiki's burger with enoki mushrooms, and a few apps with sweet potato fries. Everything was so delicious! I want another right now :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to make a personal goal of mine to try each of the burgers at Bachi. The fusion burgers that I've eaten haven't disappointed me just yet. 

On my last visit to Bachi Burger, I ordered the Miyagi Burger cooked medium rare. The juicy burger patty was topped with lightly battered and fried onion rings, chili mayo sauce,  and a fried egg -- this was actually what \"made\" the burger. Adding a fried egg to burgers is probably one of the best culinary ideas ever. Also ordered was a side of sweet potato fries with a container of aioli for dipping. I do like the seasoned fries I've ordered in the past, but nothing beats the simplicity of these sweet potato fries. 

Bachi Burger is open until midnight. I came here for a late dinner (10:00p.m.). It wasn't busy, but there was a steady flow of diners entering and leaving."}
{"text":"I was a bit sad to know that healthy life bachi kitchen closed down because they had awesome breakfast. But, to my surprise, they reopened as bachi burger! Kudos for me, since it's closer than the Sahara location. :)

I ordered the Kiki burger, which has mushrooms, cheese, onions, etc. (see picture for full description). It was delicious, but not as flavorful. The aoli sauce is what made the burger have a lot of flavor. Overall, not bad of a burger, but I'll probably stick with my original to go burger, the lonely bird. My boyfriend ordered the miyagi San's burger. The beef was full of flavor and the fried egg was the added cherry on top! The beef had a sweet carnal iced taste which I liked. Note that the Kiki burger was Angus beef and the miyagi was wagyu beef. We also ordered a side of sweet potatoes which came with a citrus aoli dipping sauce. Who doesn't like sweet potato fries!? Delish! Great staff and very tentative. Glad they opened another one. :)"}
{"text":"Thank you, Guy!  I saw this place on \"Diner, Drive'in, and Dives.\"  And have been putting it off for the right moment to try.  Well, that moment arrived, when one of our friends said he wanted a really good burger not on The Strip.  

We ventured off The Strip... I'm telling you this is way off The Strip.  If you have heard of the LV residential area, Summerlin, it's in that neighborhood.  The trip there didn't start off well... 1)  We went the wrong direction on Sahara.  2) We were crunched on time... my boyfriend and I were leaving Vegas that night.  3) We were all hungry and wanting the burger!  We finally made it there.  It's shares the parking lot with many other businesses like a movie theater.

When we entered there were many empty tables... it was a Monday.  We looked over the menu, since there was four of us we were thinking to get four different burgers to try a little of everything.  Sorry I put a crack in that plan because they wanted one with blue cheese... I don't like blue cheese.  So we just ordered what we wanted... the guys ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, my friend choose the Black & Green Wagyu Burger, and I choose the Kiki's Burger (According to the server, this is one of the most popular burgers).  My burger was okay, I wish I had ordered one with the Wagyu just because the quality and taste of the beef is soooo much better than the Angus.  I think the next time I go, it will be the Miyagi-san burger for me.  We also ordered the ox-tail chili cheese fries.  I think they were okay, personally I don't like cilantro and beans, which they have to the chili.  I think the flavor of the chili was good with the cheese and surprisingly the fried egg on top.  Personally, I wouldn't order it again, unless someone else wanted it.

Overall, service was good.  Nothing to complain about.  A point of advice is... if you like your burgers well done... do not order the Wagyu, it will just throw off the texture of the beef.  As your server will advise, as did our server. This is definitely a place to try if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Flavors are always impressive the way they come together. So if you're not sure about a burger just try it! All of the fries are excellent too. 
Had to make a big shout out to Chantal? The waitress? I noticed she was providing really good customer service to this guy. He walked in alone and had not seemed to had fusion burgers before she took the extra time out to explain everything to him and really went the extra mile."}
{"text":"I truly expected more! I mean it wasn't bad but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Can I just start by saying, \"amazing, eclectic, and mouth watering..\"   If you want to experience a taste of hamburger heaven this is the place to be.  I would have given this 5 stars however, since the restaurant is fairly new, the service has yet to match up to its popular demand.  Although, it took awhile to get our food, it was totally well worth the wait.  

The concept of Asian Fusion burgers is such a treat.  What's even more interesting was the story behind the restaurant's name.  From the owner's perspective Bachi is a combo of two things: abbreviated from the term \"hibachi\" which is Japanese style of grilling and \"bachi\" also means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.  
I had to opportunity to check this place out on my recent visit to Vegas.  This happens to be my brother's favorite new hot spot for good eats.  We ordered the following:

Ronin Burger   8
Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli on the side

***** This burger gets 5 stars!!!  The combination of the ingredients makes it probably one of the tastiest and eclectic burger I've ever had. This was pure heaven taking a bite out of this fresh succulent burger.      

Kalbi Burger   8
Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo  

***3 stars- Personally I thought this was OK.  There was really no wow factor for me other than the fact that it was served with Kim Chee

Short Rib Steamed Buns   9.5
Two Tender Braised Wagyu Short Rib Bao Sandwiches, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, Horseradish Yuzu Aioli   

*****5 stars-This was a real treat! Short ribs were extremely tender and the combination of all the ingredients were extremely  complimentary and super scrumptious.

Truffle Parmesan Fries   3.5 
French Fries, Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle, Chives, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli   

****4 stars-Looses a star for the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli, sauce needs more work and kick down more truffle sauce too! Overall, the fries were awesome!

Portuguese Donuts, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato     4

***3 stars-I thought this was ok.  The gelato was quite tasty.

Overall this place is definitely a must see!  Ambiance is cool! Staff is quite friendly. Price point perfect...   I will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas for 15+ years and have burgers from the greatest restaurants at Las Vegas has the offer chefs like Gordon Ramsay Wolfgang Pok and the Kiki's burger here is the best burger I've ever had in my life"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the the reviews and friends suggestions. We did order our food to go and drove about 5 minutes out and ate within 10 min of picking up our food. I was not impressed by their food. We ordered 2 different burgers and their specialty fries and everything was sweet. The fries made my tongue numb from one of the seasonings they use. Lol. I did order the wrong fries but I still had hopes that the one I got, salt pepper garlic fries was going to be good. It looks good!!! The 2 burgers we ordered were the Miyagi-san and Ronin. Again, both had a sweet taste to it, too sweet for my liking on a burger."}
{"text":"Delicious, original burgers are truly the way to my heart. I've tried 3 or 4 burgers on the menu and I'm always surprised by the depth of flavors in each. My favorite by far is the mushroom burger. It's a bit odd that I wouldn't even eat a mushroom 5 years ago and now it's one of my favorite foods.

I have to take 1 star off for service and a ridiculous story. My roommate used to work at the Blue Diamond location and knows the menu fairly well. He ordered a burger medium rare and it clearly came out on the verge of well done. When he said something the head chef had the nerve to come out and say that's how that particular burger looks when it is medium rare. Apparently he was trying to make sure he didn't have to cook another burger but obviously that's awful customer service. Shame on you Bachi Burger. You deserve 5 stars but your chef deserves a swift kick in his ass."}
{"text":"We had the Oxtail Chili Fries and Pork Belly Steambuns for appetizers"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is an absolute gem, offering tremendous value and tasty food in a very unassuming location.

When entering the restaurant from the parking lot, you probably won't be expecting much.  I know that I was expecting to see a basic burger menu and not much else.  I couldn't have been more wrong.

The menu is best described as Hawaiian fusion comfort food, which made a lot more sense when I read that the chef came from Roy's.  In addition to standard burgers, the menu has some unique Asian burger twists as well as tasty options such as pork buns.  There's also a nice selection of fries, a huge boba menu and an eclectic selection of beers and sake.

I went with the most straightforward menu option to get a feel for what they could do with a basic burger.  I ordered the American Wagyu burger with cheddar cheese and bacon added.  The verdict: delicious and incredibly well crafted.  The bun was golden and perfectly soft, and the burger itself was certainly high quality and savory.  The fries added to the enjoyment, especially the truffle fries with a magnificent aioli for dipping.

Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the best part... the value.  The Wagyu burger comes in at an almost unbelievable $7.  Add cheese and bacon and now you're talking $9.  Truffle fries come in at $3.50.  These prices fall in line with restaurants like Applebee's, and the quality difference can be measured in miles.  I didn't get to indulge in any of the desserts (which sounded like they should be on the menu at a Michelin starred restaurant) but they're all $5.  This could be the best value in the entire city.

I've seen several reviewers here bring up Burger Bar, and I respectfully disagree with those that say the Bachi Burger is superior.  However, my favorite customized Buffalo burger at Burger Bar is over twice as much money but not twice the quality or taste.  And the convenience of the location makes it that much more attractive.

Bachi Burger deserves to be a huge hit, and I highly recommend that locals check it out once.  Your taste buds and your wallet will be thankful."}
{"text":"Used to love coming to Bachi Burger. However it seems that as they expand the quality has gone down. Bachi is a place we've brought 10+ different groups of people visiting town to because it was worth it. 2 months ago we ate here and the food was meh. Truffle fries were undercooked, buns burnt and they forgot all the sauces on our burgers. 

Last week I took my parents there because they had just moved here and it's close to them. While we appreciate friendly servers, having your employee stand at our table and proceed to talk the entire time was not necessary. Nor was it necessary for him to come back and continue his drivel while we had mouthfuls of food and wanted to have our own conversation. Now let's get to the food. 

We all ordered our burgers Med or Med Rare. They were all brought to us well done and the paltry grey color of frozen meat patties that by health code rules cannot be cooked below medium well. Again our burgers had no sauces and our truffle fries that showed up 10 minutes after we got our burgers were woefully undercooked. 


Do. Better. Bachi Burger"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped by to check out this place.  Amazing!!!!!   Asian fushion inspired burgers are done so well here.  The oxtail fries are big and must be shared.  It's gonna be my go to place before I drive back to LA."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food!! Great service! Vegas need more spots like this"}
{"text":"Well, I love the BB on windmill.  So I brought my mother here to try it out. She is from AZ and never had BB.

We were seated, never asked if we wanted water, or anything.  Sat for 10 mins while to guys fumbled around making a shake and a mojito.  About 8 people in there including us.  

Service was aweful as there was none.  Won't be back.  Terrible for a Bachi Burger place."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to give this place a try since reading all the good reviews. I was not disappointed. The burgers were very fresh and inviting. I had the Ronin burger and my wife had the Kiki's burger. We also had the truffle parmesan fries which were quite good. My wife wasn't as impressed as I was. She didn't really like the taste of her burger, maybe she is too used to the American burger taste. But I absolutely loved my burger. It was moist and juicy and the bun was very good. The service was friendly and because it was our first time there, we even got a bowl of shrimp chips on the house. But we were too full to thoroughly enjoy it. They have quite a few other burgers that I am interested in trying. Next time....."}
{"text":"On my most recent visit to Las Vegas, I decided to drive off the Strip and try out Bachi Burger. I've seen and heard good things about this Asian fusion style burger joint. 

The place, which opened a couple years ago, is rather non-exciting. It's a very open tall space, but I felt like the place could use a better job with its interior decoration. The staff was all friendly and helpful as well.

Now, onto the food. We started with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Truffle Parmesan Fries, Chili Fried Chicken, and then our burgers. The fries and chicken were average. The chicken had a nice flavor to it, but it was a bit dry for me. Totally loved the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries along with the fried egg on top. It's a must order.

I split a Ronin Burger and a Miyagi-San's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. The Ronin has some Japanese coleslaw with some Yuzu citrus in it as well as fried egg. I loved it. The Miyagi San was enormous, with its bacon and onion rings in the burger. I preferred the Ronin. I completely loved the Taiwanese buns they used...so soft and tasty. They're made at a local bakery several miles away. 

Though these gourmet Asian fusion burgers can be a bit on the pricey side (similar to Umami Burger), they're well worth it. Burgers are 7oz and I was more than full when our meal was done. I wish I had some space for their malasadas for dessert. Their strawberry guava milkshake was quite delish as well. Their Asian-inspired menu also includes a bunch of boba teas."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has an interesting menu for a burger joint. That's bc this joint serves no ordinary burgers! We began with the Bachi Pickles, an assortment of eight different types of pickles, all handmade and very delicious. We had the Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt served up with Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce, a delicious match. Each of us ordered a burger - think of your juiciest most succulent backyard barbecue burger ever taking a quick trip to Japan and stopping off in Hawaii on the way back, and you have all the wonderful influences that make Bachi Burgers so wonderful. I ordered the Kiki Burger: 5 ounces (1/3 lb) of thick, juicy, tender, delicious Texas Kobe beef topped with caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade, very tiny petite mushrooms and tender fresh cool greens, served on a warm bun. My dining partner enjoyed a Signature BBQ Bachi Burger, a tender 5 oz Angus Beef burger served up on a warm steamed bun with crispy cool lettuce, a thick slice of ripe tomato and thin slice of raw onion. Everything was better than we dreamed it would be! We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food, we had the ramen and oxtail fries which were both fantastic. It was quick, staff was friendly. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"I'm writing this hoping someone reads it and saves this great restaurant. 
I love the burgers here. Mine was great. My wife ordered hers protein style and all the lettuce came out coated in oil. She's ordered it this way before, and it's never been served with oil. Forget about sending it back, we would never see it again.
The host was setting the tables up for doom. Too many tables sat at the same time in the same servers section made it a 10 minute wait for drinks. Oh and pointing to my table from across the room doesn't feel like seating me.
Our server forgot our drinks twice, and when our burgers finally did come, it only took another ten minutes for our fries to arrive. After we had to ask about them. I watched two other tables sending back food. 
I loved your food, but I'm not headed back anytime soon, last night felt like a waste of money to me."}
{"text":"This place is home to my new favorite off-strip hamburger in Las Vegas. My husband and I both had the Miyagi-san. He added cheese (Gruyere) to his but I left mine as-is and no additions were necessary. The meat was so flavorful and delicious and the toppings worked together perfectly- the furikake is an awesome touch. The truffle parmesan fries were also crazily delicious; service was friendly and prompt. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the food and their other location is fantastic but I don't think I'll be going back to the new one on Sahara, at least until they get things under control. The service was terrrrrrrrrrrrible. We waited for ages and ages for someone to take our drink order. We waited for a while for our drinks. We waited for our food. When we got our food, they gave me the wrong hamburger and then I had to wait for the right one to arrive while my husband's sat and got cold. THEN it took a while to get the check, and to finish paying. I think we were there for 2 hours total (and during that time, not one single person asked me if I wanted a drink refill!).

The food is still really good but the service is astoundingly better at the old location so I'll keep going there, even if it is further away."}
{"text":"Pure burger perfection is what I can summarize this place to be.

Seriously, where I come from, there isn't any kind of burger joint like this.  From the Wagyu burger to the kalbi burger, even the kale chicken salad, Bachi Burger does is right with flair!

Both times I've been here, I have been blown away.  The oxtail fries are to die for, creamy in sauce, deliciousness in the oxtail meat, seasoned perfectly with the right amount of seasoning. Fries cooked very well to taste, crispy and flavorful.  Top it all of with scallion garnish. It's definitely an order to share, unless you're feeling extra gluttonous.

The kalbi burger with the kalbi sauce, fried egg, kimchi is amazing as well. Cooked medium rare, the juices were bursting with beef flavor, balanced out by the fried egg. A medley of kimchi, and kalbi sauce, complimented each other perfectly.  Also helped tremendously are the buns.  Soft and flaky, border lining on buttery, rounded out the burger, elevating it above the rest. 

On my second visit, I had the pleasure of eating the Shogun burger, with its Wagyu beef (a $30 burger no less) patty.  Creamy, thick and tender.  Arguably the best burger I've had in my life up to this point.  The tenderness is balanced out by the crispy onion rings in the middle, and did I mention the bacon?  Somehow, even the bacon tasted like it absorbed the Wagyu flavors, and a creamy fried egg makes this burger to die for! 

The spot is very inviting, and warm.  Very spacious in the ebb and flow, staff friendly and efficient.  They handled our party of 14 like a pro in my second visit.  Everyone received their food within 5 minutes of each other once food came out after 15 minutes of ordering.  It's ways off the strip, but if you have a car, definitely make your way out to the neighbourhood of Summerlin where Bachi Burger is located.  If taking a cab, it's about $30 each way from the strip and back and a 30 minutes ride.

There's also a movie theatre next door if you want to take it easy in your visit to Vegas.

Side note, the burgers are cooked on a flat top Hibachi grill, hence the Bachi in the Bachi Burger.

Definitely one of the top spots to visit while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here with sky-high expectations. The people I know who've eaten here told me amazing things, but I found the food was just okay. The burgers and fries were good, but needed salt and pepper. So basic. I felt like they rely on sauces to make up for a lot of the flavor. The other thing I didn't like is that the menu has a lot of Asian items I'm unfamiliar with. While I consider myself an adventurous eater, I want to have a pretty good idea of what I'm ordering. I did ask the waiter to explain a few items, but I ended up going for a safe choice. 

Bottom line, there was nothing \"wrong\" with the food, but I'm not going to go home and crave the food from Bachi Burger. Honestly, In-N-Out is better, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Better than Unami. Love the pork buns and strangely, the crab cakes. Burgers good too but usually get a salad w a protein here. Star taken away for service. They are slow to get to the table for greetings and orders but quick to get you out the door. Not many smiles but who knows what goes on in the kitchen. Usually come here after catching a flick w my kid."}
{"text":"Only if you love garlic! Everything and I mean everything here is loaded with garlic. If you like garlic great if you're on a date lol or not a huge fan ask them a head of time how to order wo garlic in you food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Saw them on the food network.   They are worth the hype.   The food is fresh and innovative.   We started with edaname chili and order a ronin burger.  Wow!  Service  was great.  Took a bit for my burger to come out but it was worth the wait. Will definitely come back again to sample the menu!  Vegas rocks!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing burger I have ever had!!!!!! We went twice in one week. And if I could eat burgers everyday I would eat baci burgers. It's so good that it's ok that it takes a little longer than most restaurants and there is usually a wait no matter what time of the day or what day of the week. Get there early before you are super hungry. But wow is it uniquely good :)"}
{"text":"Lunch at 11:30 on a Friday. Still ample seating at that time but when I left a little afternoon there was a line out the door, so this is a popular place. Greeted and seated pretty promptly, but then the service went down hill. Way too long before I was greeted by my server. After my order was taken, another very long wait before I had my tea and place setting. 

The menu was an extensive list of premium burgers as well as premium ramen. Ramen looked very tempting, but I opted for the burger. Ordered the house salad ($5) and the Black and Green burger ($16). For $16 you only get a burger - anything else is extra so this is a pricey place. The salad was exceptional. I ordered the Wagyu beef burger medium but it arrived well done - ugh. It was a beautiful burger, and it tasted good, but for $16 is has to be perfect as ordered, and this was not. 

Glad I gave this place a try, but there are much better burger places with better food and better service for $21 of value. With better management and more attention to detail, this place could be very good."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has become somewhat of a tradition for us. Every trip to Vegas includes a visit to Bachi Burger. The burgers are delicious and very affordable. On this particular trip I had:

Miyagi-San Burger -- This probably my favorite burger here. Wagyu grass feed beef, topped with a friend eggs, onion rings, and caramelized bacon. It also has a wonderful sweet glaze on the patty. Delicious!!

Kiki's Burger -- Also a great burger! I was trying to eat something a little healthier so a friend and I did halfsies on the Kiki and the Myagi-San. The Kiki is topped with caramelized ones and an array of mushrooms.

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries -- These chili cheese fries are great. Oxtail chili served a top fries with Cheese, fried egg and jalapenos. These are always so yummy, but probably not too healthy to eat too often. Our table shared one order, but I can definitely eat the entire thing myself.

Now for the best part of my review (drum roll please)..............

After having spoke to the owner it turns out Bachi Burger is coming to LA!!! I was very excited to hear this. My friends and I have been talking about how great it would be if Bachi were closer. Expect them to open up sometime in the fall. I can't wait! I better start buying my pants one size larger, because I'm going to need them. =P"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives years back and wanted to try it but much like other restaurants Guy Fieri have went to it is ehhhh. 

First walked in and took awhile for servers to acknowledge and walk over since they don't have a dedicated hostess. Noticed the decent sized menu but a bit pricey. Known for the oxtail chili cheese fries at $11.00 and it was aright. The chili and beans were too sweet which just threw off the whole dish. The miyagi-san burger at $15.00 was small but had wagyu beef and was cooked well. 

Service was a bit slow at times. I wouldn't drive all the way out here from the strip or cab it but instead just get another burger with so many other options available."}
{"text":"DELISSSHHHHHH!!!

omg I've been to this place twice and both times were great. their chili fries is the bomb. it's huge, melty and tasty! I also tried their burgers both times. I forgot what I ordered the first time, but for my second visit I got their special burger with baked scallop on top of the burger patty. that burger was like a surf and turf in a bun. I like that the scallops made the burger not as heavy. ahhh I wish they open one in LA area so I can go more often!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot to go for burgers. Once you eat here you can't eat anywhere else for burgers. I truly enjoy the spicy miso burger, but have tried the kalbi burger as well. The kalbi burger was a little on the salty side, but still good. Fries are good side dish. Oxtail chili chest fries are okay, like my fries crunchy, big portion. Also, a good side is the pork belly steam bao. The summerlin location is clean, not loud and never have to wait in line."}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes for us to get a waiter. Once we did, I had to remind the waiter to take our drink order.

I ordered the Hiyashi Chuka and the flavor was horrendous. Hiyashi is one of my favorite dishes in the summer time. I order it almost every where that has it.

Once I let management know, they were very kind but I could not wait for more food.

When we got the check, the Hiyashi was still on the bill!  My waiter was completely oblivious to the fact that I had sent it back! 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Burgers with unique Asian-oriented toppings. Wings too. I've been here a half-dozen times. Good beef although some toppings can overwhelm the burger taste. I almost o.d.-ed on their Thai tea."}
{"text":"I am so glad we came here! I saw this place on Triple D and I have been having wet dreams about it ever since ;) We tried the truffle Parmesan fries, kikis burger and the bahn mi. I'm glad I went with other yelpers recommendations because I really loved the kikis burger. The Bahn Mi was also good, but just a little dry and on the sweet side for me, but my husband loved it. Either way, everything was amazing and our server, Marquis was great. And the truffles fries and apple lychee soda were excellent as well. I just wish we could have tried more and didn't have to drive 6 hours to have it again. Boo! :)"}
{"text":"New Location, same great food (with a couple menu changes). The new spot is right next to the movie theater on Sahara and Ft. Apache. It looks to be larger than their original spot but only half of the dining room was being used the night I went. 

The wife went with the kiki burger -- always a good choice. New to the menu (at least since the last time I went to Bachi Burger) is their lobster roll ($15). It's two mini buns stuffed with lobster mixed with fennel and a curry spiced aioli with lettuce. It may not be a traditional lobster roll flavor, but the curry creates a unique and tasty asian-inspired version of this classic. The freshly fried taro chips that accompany the dish were delicious as well.

Service was good, especially considering that the place just opened earlier this week. Although it was odd that my wife's burger came out several minutes before my food or our son's food did. But, I'm sure minor issues like that will improve over time.

4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Unique menu items including gourmet burgers and ramen.  A little on the pricier side but it's definitely better than your average burger joint!  And it's delicious!"}
{"text":"After seeing Guy rave about this place on \"DDD\"  and having many yelper friends telling hubby and myself that we needed to try this place I finally gave in. A lot of the reason it took so long to try is because I am not fan of burgers. While hanging out with one of our best-est buddies Joshua G and his wifey we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.

Upon entering there were plenty of tables open but maybe not enough servers or something. The hostess told us as well the customers coming in after us that there would be a small wait so the severs could catch up. After being seated our drink orders were taken right away. I have to say the service here is great. Our server was fantastic. 

I knew I wasn't going to order a burger so I took a look at what sides and salads they had to offer. I decided to go junk food style and order some \"Crispy Onion Rings\" priced at $3.50 and \"Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries\" priced at $4.50. The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were good but I sure didn't taste any garlic. Paying extra money to have the garlic fries I do expect it to actually taste like garlic fries. My man ordered a \"Bachi Burger\" and added cheddar cheese and bacon. He did enjoy the burger but not for the price. I feel personally that for the price of the burger it should have came with fries instead of paying separate for them. I don't want to go to a burger place that looks like they just threw a few random *fancy* things on the walls just so they can charge me a la carte for everything. I have no problem paying a la carte for a establishment that enforces a dress code and doesn't have kids running around the tables. 

Bachi Burger doesn't taste terrible but is not worth another trip for me. It doesn't have any *wow* factor for the price."}
{"text":"I liked my burger here, yes. But the BEST burger in Nevada? I don't know about that...

They have an extensive menu with lots of options but I recommend sticking to a burger and fries (or some pork belly buns for those of you who don't like burgers!). We did NOT like the oxtail chili-cheese fries or the Bachi Caesar salad we ordered. My suggestion is stick to the regular fries without all that gamey meat and what not added on top!!! & do NOT order a salad LOL I give you permission to be a fattie for this entire meal, it was one of the worst caesar salads I've had and we ended up only taking a few bites and then throwing the rest away. 

My favorite burger out of the three I tried was the RONIN burger!! Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, and all of these delicious sauces... What's not to love?!?! The Shogun burger has a lot of hype because of the foie gras in it but none of the boys liked it. I thought it was tasty, BUT very sweet! due to all the fruit in it and perhaps more suited towards a girl's taste palate. However, there were a lot of different flavors and it could get a little overwhelming if you had to eat the entire thing.

The miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu burger tasted just like a good ol' fashioned BBQ burger if that's what you like but I felt that it was something I could get at a lot of other restaurants and a little plain for me especially after trying all of the other burgers bursting with flavors.

If you live in the area and like burgers, you should definitely check this place out. We had a good dinner but I don't know if I'd particularly recommend going out of your way if you're only visiting for the weekend and taking the drive off the strip to eat one of these burgers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I had a Bahn Mi Burger, which was an amazing combination of flavors.  It was maybe the best burger I've ever had.  Everything on the menu looked great...plus they had some more unusual beer selections (like Dogfish Head, which you rarely see out West).  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will go here."}
{"text":"Ok, 3 different times and three different burgers. Each and every time and each and every burger was HOT damn perfectly DEELISH!!! Service has been great each time. The condiments for the AMAZING fries!!! I cannot get enough of this place!!!"}
{"text":"So, I typically go to the Sahara location but we tried their newest location on Russell. The food, as always was BLOODY AMAZING!!! I had the Black & Green burger, it was NOM NOM & it only got better with aioli's!! We also ordered all of their fries, sweet potato ones, truffle fries, salnt & pepper fries and the jalapeno fires, the latter are my FAVORITE!!
But here's the BEST part of our dining experience, the service! When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. There were a total of 6 of us but only 2 of were there first. Carla seated us with a laugh & a smile! She also shared with us that her co-worker had called out 2 days in a row; yes, someone will be AXED from there! 
Once the rest of our party arrived, Carla continued to be a ROCK STAR! She was on point. She was pleasant. She was funny. She was fun. She made us laugh. She was just FRICKIN AWESOME!! Not once being the ONLY Server on the floor did it hinder her work or her personality! 

THANK YOU CARLA for an AWESOME time! And we WILL be back to see YOU!"}
{"text":"Yep! One of the best \"fusion\" food joints there is, and it's all centered around the burger! Great beer selection, too!"}
{"text":"As I savored a bite of the Kiki burger, I looked at my husband and said, \"Dare I say it? I think this may be the best burger I've ever had.\"

  \"Those are bold words,\" he said, taken aback.  He took a bite out of his Banh Mi burger and, nodding approvingly, said, \"...but I think you're right.\"

 We have scoured the Las Vegas Valley trying to find our premiere burger joint and always came so close but no cigar until Bachi Burger.  

 We started off with edamame and it wasn't the typical steamed appetizer you usually get a sushi joints. Their edamame is stir fried with chili and garlic.  We also had the truffle parmesan fries and were blown away.  It was such a great way to tease our appetites.

 My co-workers strongly suggested that I order the Kiki Burger.  After reading the description, I knew it was the one for me.  Everything was perfection. The meat was juicy and tasty, the bun toasty and crisp, the bacon and onions caramelized... all of the ingredients created a harmonious experience. The husband ordered the Banh Mi burger and it also didn't disappoint.

       I am surprised that other Yelpers experienced bad customer service. We were greeted and tended to by friendly staff and we were checked up on regularly. We received everything promptly.  Timing between each course was perfect.

      The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is really not that big of a deal but is a hindrance nonetheless. I ordered the lychee boba drink and I didn't taste a bit of lychee flavor in it. The husband ordered the calamansi soda. If we hadn't seen \"calamansi\" on the menu, we would've thought it was just regular soda. For dessert, I had the fruit tart and the husband had beignets.  Both were good but I'd probably just stick to the burgers next time.

     I still catch myself daydreaming of the Kiki burger ever so often. I can't wait to find out what else Bachi Burger has to offer."}
{"text":"Just moved here from LA....and the ronin burger was simply one of the best burger I have ever had! The ox tail cheese fries were great too. Can't wait to come back and try their other burgers and streamed buns"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really good. We tried it for the first time recently and it lived up to the great reviews we've been reading. 

We started with the grilled shishito peppers which came nicely grilled and placed in a shallow dish with a delicious soy dipping sauce.  

My wife tried the grilled pork belly buns and they were also delicious, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. 

I tried the 7 oz. Angus burger which was perfectly grilled and coated with a tasty soy based sauce. 

Service was terrific even though the restaurant was quite crowded.  

There are many delicious sounding items on the menu, not just burgers, so I am looking forward to our next visit. 

I highly recommend Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar today to look at the menu and maybe try some good out.  Sat there for several minutes and the person behind the bar never said sword to me or asked if I needed help.  Never even acknowledged that I was there.  I really wanted to try their food but I don't like crappy service.  Went to another restaurant.  You should train your employees a little better"}
{"text":"Normally I hate the words \"Asian Fusion\" but the sample size of various Asian cuisines is large and authentic enough not to butcher various cultures. I'm a fan. Easily the best (flavor : price) burger place in Vegas.

Burgers: So far I've tried the Miyagi, Kalbi, and Bahn-Mi burgers. And for the most part, flavor profiles are retained throughout the various cuisines. The Kalbi burger evokes Korean BBQ and Kimchi, and the Bahn-Mi burger tastes like the sandwich. What makes the burger special, however, is the texture profile. Unlike Umami burger, there is a light crunch on the outside due to a combination of caramelization and maillard, the same found on top-end steaks. Doneness is perfect and the burger balances texture and moisture, rather than having the patty soak into the bun.

Fries: Salt & Pepper fries. Delicious. Reminds me of Filipino/Vietnamese flavors (ingredient hint there)."}

These fries have jalapeños so if you don't like spice, you should probably request to leave it out! But other than that, they were delicious!

This place is off of the strip, so it's about a fifteen minute drive."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because I always hear great things about it and I LOVE a good cheeseburger, but it's just not my kind of burger.  

I got the Kiki burger and the bf got the Ronin burger with wagyu. Whatever the glaze is that was on the meat was too sweet for my liking and it was on both burgers. With that being said, the meat was still cooked well and was good quality. I would come back and give it another chance and order a different burger. I also would come back just for the oxtail chili cheese fries because that was so so good!"}
{"text":"So tonight was the second night within the week that I have visited Bachi Burger.  

Wednesday Night
-Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with a fried egg:  one of my friend, Spanky who didn't order any fries, could not stop eating this yummilicious fries.  
-Ronin Burger-talk about explosive flavors from a bite of this burger...how amazing is this?  Was a very creative and innovative burger.  Spanky, who had ate dinner earlier, had to order this burger because it sounded so freakin awesome.  He down half of that burger in literally 3 bites, AND the burger was a decent size.  I shared this burger with my other friend, since he wasn't too hungry.  However, he said he should have gotten his own burger since it was so good.
-parmasan truffle fries-I could definitely taste the truffle and the sundried tomato aioli made it so much more better.  We had to order an extra ramkin of this yummy sauce.  It cost .50 cents though.  Sure it doesn't break my bank account, but I think they can easily bring in the bucks with this because it is just that yummy.  But I have to say, the oxtail chili fries made this one forgettable. 
-I end the night with the rootbeer float.  They gave me so much icecream!  nom nom nom...

Friday Night
-Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries-What can I say...YUMMY.  This alone is quite filling for 2, note to self.
-Kiki burger:  well, i honestly thought the star of this burger are the different type of mushrooms that are in it.  When we got the burger, i was unable to taste the mushrooms :(  The bacon was overpowering everything else.  Still, a good burger.

Service:   Wonderful
Ambience: Contemporary Nice Feel
Food:  GGGGREAT!!"}
{"text":"What I love about this location is the hours. This location in particular opens till 2am, AND just minutes from my house. 

I was blown away with the service here, considering the late hours, Saturday night and the occasional drunks. The entire staff was extremely nice, my server (Joseph) was way nice and on the ball making sure we didn't need anything....loved him!

The food was BOMB! I'm not a fan of craziness in my burger so ordered a plain and simple 7oz Bachi Burger. The angus meat was cooked well, just as I ordered, AND still was juicy. The bun was perfectly warm, fluffy and ingredients were just the right amount. 

Only thing about this place is the ridiculous add-on's. For these burger prices you would think they would come with Cheese, to the least. No. It's extra. Lol. 

This is my choice when I miss In-N-Out's 1:30am cutoff. :-D"}
{"text":"The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I had a party of 10 it was nice of them to find a table that fits all of my friends and family. The reason why I gave them three stars it is because they didnt have a lot of food in stocks. They weren't serving ramen and also they didn't have the loco moco. It took awhile to have our food ready.  It is a pretty big size. My friends and family struggled to finished it all. I would recommend sharing with your significant other or whomever. I got the Kiki burger and it was okay. You definitely can taste the mushroom. Also I ordered the fresh strawberry lemonade. It was sweet not sour at all. Overall, I would only return if my family or friend insist of coming back."}
{"text":"Service and food were outstanding.

Ginger Beer = clean but delicious ginger flavor. 

Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Shake = pb heaven. 

Oxtail Chili Fries = spicy and addictive. they did the right thing by putting the chili over skinny fries.

Ronin Burger & Kiki's Burger = fresh, soft buns. beef patties cooked to a perfect pink in the middle. Kiki's was my favorite with its peppery argula and savory mushrooms but the Ronin was still a fierce competitor putting out its more acidic and sweet flavors against the saltiness of the fried egg. 

I miss Bachi Burger already. Keep doing what you're doing. Until we meet again."}
{"text":"I've been to this exact location a couple times.  The service was great, our waitress nailed it and was always around making sure we had what we need.  Overall it felt like the staff were well organized and worked well together.  I ordered a cider but it was bottled and seemed like just a selection from the supermarket and not really chosen to pair with a food and for specific qualities of the cider itself.  I got the kalbi burger and it was perfect top to bottom, the flavors worked perfectly and was just an awesome burger.  I order some fried but wasn't too jazzed about this visit's selection (truffle fries), but I'll chalk that one up to my choice.  My last visit had a better fry selection.  

Overall I'm a fan and glad they have a couple in LA.  It's a great burger spot off the strip and not a far drive away."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine and I love me a good burger as well, so when someone suggested the new Bachi Burger location for dinner a couple of weeks ago, I didn't complain.  We had a party of four and showed up for a later dinner (9:00ish) on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was quiet but I instantly liked the ambiance and modern feel... The hostesses that greeted us were not the most welcoming, or perhaps they were confused since we asked if we could sit at a table that was vacant but hadn't been cleaned yet instead of sit elsewhere.  Once the seating situation was settled, the staff was friendly-ish, but the service itself was on the (very) slow side.

We were all pretty hungry, so we ordered some apps for the table to start with: Bachi Pickles, Edamame, and Truffle Parm Fries.  The pickled plate isn't ideal for sharing, but the others made  up for it and our party demolished both.  For my entree, I went for the Bachi Fish sandwich and added shishito pepper.  I happen to love shishito pepper, but when I've had it at Asian / International inspired places before, it's cooked. The shishito pepper on my sandwich was not - oh well.  Lesson learned: I like shishito pepper best when it's cooked!  The fish itself was cooked to perfection and of course the fluffy bun it was served on complimented it well.  It was fluffy and sweet.

The others at the table had a Mr Miyagi burger, a Spicy Miso burger, and a Lonely Bird.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their respective orders.  Most of us had iced matcha green tea to drink...

From what I hear, this location is fairly new, so they likely just have to work through some kinks with the service.  I'd definitely be open to returning in the future once that happens.  If you're craving a simple burger, or even something a bit more creative, you can't go wrong with the food at Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"This classic is a family favorite at this point, so while the food is great it may influence my rating. We celebrate birthdays, special occasions, promotions, all kinds of things at Bachi Burger in my family. Okay, we might actually look for reasons to go to Bachi Burger. 

The Asian style burgers have a lot of flavor, plus there's a great bun-to-everything-else ratio, and our favorites are the Ronin Burger (onion strings, fried egg, generally awesome), the Kiki burger (mushrooms, bacon sweet onion marmalade), and those chili oxtail fries which are heaven in a bowl. 

Perfect for a family outing and arguably one of the best burgers in Las Vegas, this place is home."}
{"text":"If you're looking for gourmet burgers, this is the place.

My second time here for a late dinner. We ordered the Bone Marrow Jam: it was decadent, and since it's a jam, it's a little sweet. The bread was nice and crispy, and the foie gras butter just adds that extra umph to the bite. 

Black and Green Burger was cooked perfectly. Medium rare was just the way we like it. The meat also has some sort of sweet flavor to it and the blue cheese complements it. 

I really liked the Banh Mi burger.  The mix of shrimp, beef and pork patty made it a unique and flavorful bite.

Their burgers are large and their sides are reasonably priced.

The service are on par.

Oh! we found a new love, a very flavourful sake called Wakatake \"Demon Slayer,\" fruity with a nice aroma and hints of peach and tangerine. We purchased a 720ml bottle to take home. $42 seemed high but hey you get what you pay for.

Bachi has won me over with their delicious burgers, delicious fries, and friendly and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Have been here twice, first time got the Ronin burger..thats the one with the fried egg on top and wow, it was pretty bomb. I had never had a burger w/ fried egg and I'm glad Bachi Burger was the first place i tried it, because they didn't do me wrong. It was a bit messy but not where the patty is sliding out of the bun kinda messy, which I hate. 

Second time, got the Kabli burger (no bacon) and OMG..best burger ever! It was cooked perfectly, the bun was amazing, the cheese, everything was perfect. BOTH times have gotten the Parmesan truffle fries. Seriously people, do not pass these fries up. They are the best. I love that everything comes with a dipping sauce. I'm a huge fan of dipping!

The wait staff is awesome and very informative..this place is definitely a hit, I hope it sticks around for a long time!"}
{"text":"This chain sucks. Too expensive for a burger. The staff is rude on the windmill establishment. Hiring a chef to prepare burgers is a waste. Train yourstaff to serve customers. Clear the tables and stop trying to pretend you're a 5 star 5 course restaurant. DENNYS HAS BETTER BURGERS!"}
{"text":"Best crab cake sandwich on this side of the Valley!  Amazing burgers and excellent thin and crispy fries. Lots of options."}
{"text":"After Jaws I figured I'd stop in for dinner since it was right next door.  I was sat quickly and the server came to take my order a few minutes later which was enough time to figure out what I wanted.  I ordered the red sangria, a black and green burger, and salt & pepper garlic fries.  The sangria was good, the burger was alright, and something in the fries made me have a reaction that left my tongue tingling and a little swollen after the first couple so I ate no more of them.  

Really the burger was not all that great with the meat actually being a bit on the tasteless side.  For $14 with no fries included I expected something really good and I just got \"meh\".  Service was also a little slow but not horribly so.  I probably will come back and try some of their non-burger items if I'm in the area again but it won't be soon since there are other restaurants I want to try."}
{"text":"Celebrating my daughter's 22nd birthday with brunch. Everything was fresh and very tasty. Menu is wonderful and expands on more than just burgers. Thank goodness they are so close, will become habit forming."}
{"text":"My wife took me there for lunch one day and I was blown away with the burger I had. The chill cheese fries are out the this world. OMF!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on 9/26 for lunch. It was OK. I ordered the spicy miso burger protein style and it was fine. It wasn't bad, it was even pretty good. It is just hard to get excited about this place. The service is OK. Not good but not bad. Definitely slow and not attentive. 

Unless someone orders their fries as an appetizer, they probably want them with their meal, not 20 minutes ahead of time.  The house made pickles were good. 

I was excited to see that they have Boba, but I didn't try it. I would not choose to go back, but if a friend wanted to, I would go with them."}
{"text":"I went here about six weeks ago and ordered Kiki's burger. It was prepared well and tasted great. The house made pickles were also good. The service was OK. They definitely keep the servers busy and you pretty much never see them unless you're ordering or paying. I like this location better than the Windmill one. If I had gone to that one first, I would not have tried this one."}
{"text":"My favorite uppity burger before was probably the truffle burger at Umami in California because I LOVE the taste/smell of truffle oil.

I'm going to go ahead and say that the Shogun burger($26) is easily the best burger I have ever had. The price is high but omfg the taste was off the charts.  What really drew me to order it was because I wanted to try what foie gras tasted like for the first time and it did not disappoint. It's a perfect burger to me.  Juicy patty, fatty truffle foie gras, sweetness from the pear, and the soft crispy crunch around the edge of the bun.  It had all the right textures and flavor.

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries like everyone recommended and it was damn good.  We also ordered the Kiki and Spicy Miso burgers.  I didn't really care for them after trying the shogun burger though.  Angus patty wasn't as good as the wagyu but don't get me wrong, they were still good burgers.  Little things bothered me with each burger like how the spicy miso burger had too much sauce for my taste and the bacon in the kiki burger was a salty pop that I thought was too much at times.

Service was top notch.  Server and hostess were great and empty plates and trash were never on the table for more than 3-5 minutes.  Water was always topped off.  Places like this is what 5 star ratings are for."}
{"text":"It's time for them to upgrade to a bigger place! It's winter time...We decided to go here after I was looking at all the yummy looking photos on yep.  I saw this place a few years ago when it was coming soon.....Soooo, we walked in this place, and you couldn't even get to the host to put your name on the list for a table.   Ok so, we finally made it to him put our name on the list.  They told us about 40 min wait!  Wow!  Come to find out, you can't call and make reservations, not good!  We decided to just order to go.  Well that was still a 40 min. wait.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer, My husband ordered the Ronin Burger uummmm, they kept the egg though!  I ordered the Crusty Crab, Truffle fries and salt and pepper fries.

I loved the Chicken appetizer, it was so good, but with all the dipping sauces, I wasn't sure what was suppose to go with it.  I did try all of the sauces with the chicken.  Again, not sure which one was suppose to go with the chicken

I loved both fries the truffle one was different, but it was still good.  I really liked the salt and pepper one.  It had jalapenos and cilantro on it,  what a nice touch. 

The Ronin, we ordered well done....we didn't get that, it was medium well!  If that were my burger, I couldn't have eaten it!  When a customer ask for well done, we don't want to see any red!  So due to that I didn't even get to taste it.  My husband was ok with it.  He said it was not bad.  Except he would have also left the coleslaw off. 

So on to the Crusty Crab...I'm not use to mushy...If you like your crab crispy....I would pass on this one.  It was mushy....I wasn't expecting this to be mushy.  It was eitable, but I think crispy is better.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Try something else, unless you don't mind mushy.

The employee's seemed like they were stressed out!  It was crazy busy, and this is a Wednesday night.    I would hate to see it on a Friday or Saturday.

I think if I go back, I will call ahead, and only get it to go, the host said it's busy all the time!  Great for them, but I don't like to wait like that."}
{"text":"I love Bachi Burger. The burgers, the fries, the shakes - it's all great. This is how a burger SHOULD be.

My biggest complaint about this location is that there always seems to be a wait. We've typically had to wait 20 to 30 minutes each time before we get seated.

But once we do finally get seated and those truffle fries hit the table, all is forgiven."}
{"text":"Been here twice, the first time my gf (who is a pescatarian) wanted the Krabby Patty, which apparently was discontinued but still displayed on the menu. That was annoying. Second visit we just came for takeout, and were ignored for the first 10 mins. We waited to put in our order, then finally after asking the host, a server came by to take it. We waited at the bar for easily 15 minutes before the bartender noticed us and asked us if we wanted any water. The place wasn't crowded at all, a few empty tables in fact. We were the only take out customers. We waited a total 30-40 mins for the food to finally be ready, and it was cold and soggy. The burgers were ok, (asked for medium rare, it was medium-well). Overall not a great experience. This review refers mainly to the customer service aspect, the food was decent earning a 2 star rating instead of 1."}
{"text":"I love Bachi Burger! The food is great quality and thankfully they are more than open to modification (in my case for allergies)."}
{"text":"Our waiter was AMAZING. However, the food was not. It was over priced and we were not given warning that the french fries did not come with the meal, or that they contained EXTREMELY spicy peppers!"}
{"text":"I had previously reviewed Bachi Burger and given them two stars because of very inattentive service and average food that was overpriced.  I went back with a friend and gave them another chance.  Unfortunately it was more of the same.

It was Saturday night around 8 PM and they were not busy -- about 12 other people there in a place that seats at least 4x that amount.   We were seated immediately and given water.  The waiter came back and got us some sodas.  Last time I had the cherry yuzu, this time I got the apple lychee.  Both are good, but at almost $4 and no refills, tell them to go light on the ice.  

When we were ready to order I had to flag down the waiter.  Eventually someone serving other tables came over and took our order.  He did not write any of it down and the entire time I'm thinking \"really?\"  Sure enough, at the end we asked him to repeat it back to us and he got part of it wrong.  Is it some ego thing or what?  The guy has no idea what we are ordering or how much, won't write it down, and messes up an order of two burgers and two orders of fries.

My burger was overcooked but no big deal.  Anyway the food is fine (nothing amazing), but it still feels way overpriced.  I had indicated we'd be ordering dessert towards the end of the meal but after the initial checkup a minute or two after getting the food, the waiter never voluntarily came over to our table for the remainder of the night.  Note that there were at least 3 waiters for fewer than 20 people in the place the entire night.

We flagged down a waiter and eventually got the Portuguese donuts dessert.  What was described by the waiter as \"a good amount of ice cream\" ended up being one scoop, and we had to ask for extra dishes because none were brought out so we could split it up.  After finishing we had to, once again, flag down a waiter to get the check and, not surprisingly, flag down a waiter to get him to pick it up again.  

All in all, the food is OK, and I might go there regularly if the food was 2/3 of the price and the service was decent."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burger I've ever had and definitely the best chili cheese fries I've ever had. Got the Miso Burger and Oxtail chili cheese fries. Both are phenomenal. Beer prices are decent too. Eat here an you'll be thankful you did."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. It took forever for 1 burger and fries to come out. My friend and I were sharing.  They wouldn't cut it in half because it would of ruined the presentation. We azked for no walnuts on the veggie burger. The waiter came back and said the walnuts were inside the pattie. I woukd expect the waiter to know the menu a little better. We said it was fine about the walnuts but didn't realize it tasted pretty much like walnuts. I won't go back. If you eat, I would maybe suggest to try it."}
{"text":"We saw this place on Dinners drive ins and dives on the food network and we had to try it when we were in town.  We were not disappointed the truffle fry's and burgers were amazing !  We had s group of 7 and we split several burgers and all were very tasty.  A big thumbs up to Emily our bar tender and her basil smash cocktail !!"}
{"text":"Definitely a different type of burger joint! Fusion between Japanese cuisine and burgers makes for a very interesting combination and then even more interesting selection on the menu. If you're looking for traditional burger I'd go somewhere else, this place has gourmet burgers you would've never dreamt of. We had a great meal, two very unique burger selections left your mouth drooling. The best thing about the food is combining it with a nice cold Japanese beer. The atmosphere is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"How can I describe the foodgasm that is Bachi Burger?. This place could turn Vegans into carnivores. It's that good.

We come here every few months and yes it's always busy, yes there's always a wait but yes, it is always worth it!! 

The Ronin, Miyagi and Kiki are my favorites. I have a hard time swaying from those three but I'm sure one day I'll venture outside the triangle because I know I'll never be disappointed with the food here. The buns are perfection, the meat is always tender juicy and full of savory flavors and the toppings are outrageously good and the creativeness of each one is what makes these burgers my number one in Vegas. I can't get enough of this place. Along with the burgers order yourself not one, but 2 orders of oxtail fries because once you try them you'll want a full serving  to yourself! Basically chili cheese fries on steroids of meaty goodness. 

The donuts are also amazing! 

We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I will say it was good, but it wasn't great. 

There were quite a few people when we came in. The place looked packed but there is a smaller room right off to the side with more tables. 

Our server was having an off night. They were forgetting stuff or bringing out items that weren't ordered. Somewhat frustrating. 

Don't be surprised by how weird the menu is... They make all of the burgers sound overly complex, but it's not that crazy. I personally liked the wagyu burger with lettuce, cheese, and tomato. 

We didn't try the shakes. Next time! 

Overall it was a different experience, but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous ! Loved the 2 burgers we ordered and split. Kimchi and the Kiki burgers were what we ordered along with garlic fries which also came seasoned with ginger and jalapeños. Cooked medium rare as we ordered, great flavor on a perfect bun. Service was also casual but attentive. A must stop when we are back in town again."}
{"text":"Good food but a bit understaffed. These burgers are big so come ready. Their food tastes very fresh, and the restaurant layout is very modern. Started off with calamari, pretty standard. We then ordered the Banh mi burger and the ronin burger with truffle fries and another friend had one of the salad burgers. Nothing to improve on there, food was perfectly cooked. I tried some of the seasoning on the table, that vinegar sauce has a good kick to it. Overall very good experience."}
{"text":"We went here on another yelper's review. They are capitalizing on the burger fad and not doing a great job of it. It was expensive for what we got. Not a place that I will be going back to."}
{"text":"So I had to take the boyfriend to try out these burgers (yes, they're that good). I chose a night that we weren't starving and had some patience--preparing him every step of the way to \"expect bad service, honey\" and \"let's be as patient as possible, honey, it's worth it\" and \"I hope they're service is better or this is the last time!\". Well, the service was MUCH better. Our waiter was attentive, quick and socially equipped. We enjoyed him ALMOST as much as the food. Our burgers were amazing, along with everything else. Happy to write a good update."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at Bachi Burger and it left a bad taste in my mouth. The food was great but the service killed it for me.

I called and put my order in for pick up at 11am and told the girl that took the order that I would be there at 12:45 to pick it up, giving them plenty of time to plan for my arrival. I showed up promptly at 12:45 only to be told that my order was never put in. I waited 15 minutes for them to make my food before trying to grab one of the waitresses for a status on where the heck my order was. When I was finally able to get the attention of one, she checked and still not order put in. I could see that many of the people at tables were very upset with the service as well because it was a packed house and there were only 2 girls waiting tables.
When I finally got my food it was 1:20 and by then I was so upset that I didn't even want to eat anymore.
I ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger and it was cooked to perfection which I think is the only thing that saved this place for me.
I have to say that I might go back because the flavors are great but I will only do so if I have a few hours to kill."}
{"text":"Holy crap, there went my diet.

Came here pretty late on a Saturday and my friends and I destroyed three burgers, oxtail chili chese fries, and a normal fries with pineapple ketchup.

I'd say the Miyagi-san was among the top three burgers I've ever had (I've had a LOT) - the bun, the meat, the toppings, they all worked really well together and dripped of both quality and creativity (and meat juices). I was only going to eat half, but couldn't resist finishing it because it was just that good.

My friends had the blue and green burger and a custom one with avocado, cheddar, and bacon, both of which were reportedly very good as well.

The oxtail chili cheese fries were also very good, though I have to admit I'm not as big a fan of chili on fries, but the garlic aioli really complimented it all very well. One thing that was quite surprising was the pineapple ketchup and how strong the pineapple flavor was and how well it went with the ketchup itself.

Our service was spot on with everything explained very well and our orders completed quickly and accurately. I couldn't ask for much more.

Prices seem quite fair to me for burgers of this quality, though I would not categorize it as an outstanding deal.

Afterwards, I decided to further my tailspin into diet-failing by having the almond boba milk tea. It was actually really good, though certainly pricey in comparison to the typical boba price.

I can tell I'm going to frequent this place more in the future. I'm not sure how I've managed to live here for almost a year and never really heard about this place!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place and we finally went to give it a try. We walked in to what seemed like 6 or 7 parties of 4 or less. We \"waited to be seated\" as the sign said. We waited... And waited. Unfortunately 5 minutes passed without anyone even saying \"we'll be right with you\". I didn't see what the delay was but we left because we already had a bad taste in our mouth. I hope the next time we try it again we won't have the same experience. 

Ps. The burgers did look awesome

I hope to make a better and real review in the future"}
{"text":"It's over-rated. My significant other swore up and down that this was a must for me.  I had to go to this place and try it.  It wasn't bad, but it was beef didn't taste like BEEF --it just took over the flavors of all the seasonings. It reminds me of when you get a slab of tofu and you just marinate it with a bunch of stuff till it loses it's original base flavor --yes I personally believe tofu has a flavor.  I think if this place ever wanted to go vegetarian they have a real shot! 

I'm not impressed. The fries were okay and everything was just okay.  If you've been to Denver, Lark Burger fries are better and Elway fries are better."}
{"text":"Second trip with a friend of mine. Friday night time to \"do work son\" eating and drinking. 
Started out with some Saki and a few beers. Skipped the appitizers and we split the following
-Pork belly steamed buns-Served like sliders, 3 in an order. they were amazing.The egg was a perfect addition to a mouth watering pieces of pork belly and the side of hoisin complimated the sandwhich
-Short Rib steamed steam sand.- My favorite. The right flavors from the grill cooked the ribs to perfection and the side of Horseradish Yuzu Aioli was so kick ass!!!
_Ronin Burger-Another great choice. Again the burger was full of flavor, love Japanese  Cole slaw with the combination of carmalized onion and a fried egg, Oh Yeah!!
-Really busy and I wouldn't say service was slow. There was enough time between the steamed buns and the burger to enjoy the meals in little sections. One of the owners, Aaron(spelling) made his way to each table to talk to the custumers and was very friendly. The server was also friendly and even was talking requests on any alcoholic items that we might like to see on the menu in the future....My new favorite Burger Spot!!!"}
{"text":"I love love this place.  This is must go to whenever Im in Vegas. I have had the Kiki burger and bahn mi burger. I got them protein style.  They were both delicious and fresh.  Their sweet potato fries and sauce it comes with is really good too. I cant wait til they open up in Santa Monica!"}
{"text":"With some friends visiting they wanted something different to try on this trip. I normally go to the Henderson location but they were staying downtown so I drove to this location. I noticed the menu to be a little different but the food was just as good. The service was on point. The waitress missed one of our burgers but she expedited it and also gave us a Thai Iced tea for the trouble. It wasn't that long of a wait anyway.

Since I was familiar with the menu I ordered appetizers for the group. We shared the oxtail chili cheese fries which are a must try and the pork belly bao. Our friend really enjoyed each of the appetizers and the burgers they had. I never had a bad experience with Bachi and I will keep dinning here with visitors or without, keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"We hit up BB after the Yelp Olympics, and after some Zumba, Bootcamp, and Cardio Combat, a bunch of us yelpers were ready for some Bachi action.

After we got seated,we were getting looks and stares from the kitchen because they reconoticed who we were, and they had some not-so-great reviews, so I just gave them a \"this is your chance to step it up from my last visit\" kinda smile.

I was hella hungry, so I ordered the following:

Bachi Pickles

Fried Chicken Appetizer

Bachi Fish

Fries with Pineapple Ketchup

(I shared the chicken, pickles, and fries with everyone; I wasn't THAT hungry!)

The pickles were very good, but my favorite were the pickled garlic cloves.
The chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Bachi Fish was absolute perfection and the ketchup was addicting!

I even savd a little room for dessert because I wanted some White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato, but was sadly denied because they no longer
have it on the dessert menu....bummer.

BB has definitely stepped it up since my last visit and has earned its 5th star...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"My first stop in Vegas before the weekend begins! My friends and I came in around 3pm and there was no wait. The customer service was amazing and fast. All of us got the Miyagi Burger and I added an order of the oxtail fries. 

The burger was such a large portion for one person so I ended up splitting that with the homie! My favorite part about the burger was the onion rings on it. So crispy and delicate like tempura. Get the meat medium cooked. Not too pink but still very juicy. 

The oxtail fries were ok...tasted like a very presentable chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Still good but nothing to die for. You also can't tell if they even put any oxtail in it lol. 

Overall great experience and I would definitely come back for the burger!!"}
{"text":"Fast service and great food.

We had the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Kiki's Burger, and Bahn Mi Burger. 

I never had a burger with a Chinese / Taiwanese sweet bun, but it works really well with the savory middle. The meat was done perfectly and the condiments were really good."}
{"text":"Got the Shogun Burger $26:
wagyu beef
grilled unagi
PAN SEARED FOIE GRAS (very mushy and overpowered by pattie
asian pear and peach (made it sweet) 

Miyagi-San's Burger $16:
wagyu beef
chili mayo
fried egg
furikake
caramelized bacon
crispy onion rings made it even sweeter than the shogun burger.

Truffle garlic fries was also very good and comes with a dipping souce.

Both burgers are very juicy and tasty and seasoned to perfection. But the Foie gras (duck liver) was very soft and cant be detected within the burger. Pricey place but very good burgers overall."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and waited extra long for our food, when it finally arrived our steak was cooked well done when we order medium rare and there was a piece of hair in our burger. Very disappointed with the food and service."}
{"text":"Am a HUGE fan.

Definitely the place to go for a delicious, out-of-the-ordinary burger experience.  

I visit every so often for lunch with one of my friends from the office, and we are quickly making our way through the menu by splitting our plates...  

Favorites:

..  but can't say that I have really had anything that wasn't above-average... Even my friend's grilled cheese was phenomenal..."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a while. .. If you like sweet and refreshing try the Apple lichee Soda.  The oxtail chilli cheese frys are the way to go.  Also the Truffle
 Parm fries rock,  also don't be cheap order all your burgers in \"wagu\" aka america kobe. My suggestions are the kiki, black and green and the sho gun."}
{"text":"First I would like to say the lemonade was to die for, the burger was to kill for  (Spicy Miso) hands down the best burger I ever had."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is awesome. I got the Miyagi-San burger while my girlfriend got the Ronin burger and while they were both delicious, it was a little too oily and the buns struggled to keep it together. We also got their oxtail chili fries and it was amazing. They all are known for this and not only did they deliver, they also were generous with its portioning. Parking isn't really an issue as its lot has plenty of room. I highly recommend this place especially after a night out because: one, it's on the way back to California (if headed that direction) and two, it's pretty heavy (good for hangovers)"}
{"text":"We happened on this place by pure serendipity. We were out shopping for something else, got hungry, looked around, and there was Bachi Burger. Neither of us eat burgers as part of our regular diet but I had been having a hankering for a burger for couple of week and I jumped at the opportunity.

Boy, did I hit the jackpot!  We both ordered their Kiki Burger. This variation includes carmelized bacon (you read right), sweet onion marmelade, sauteed Shitakee, Enohi, and Eryngil mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, and an interesting mix of chopped baby greens including frisee and maybe arugula and baby spinach. They include a garlic chili aoili on the side that adds a nice little heat kick. For the bun, they toast a Taiwanese sweet bread. The hamburger is a flavorful Angus beef. I ordered mine cooked medium.

This is the first burger in memory that I didn't want to slather with ketchup to boost the moistness and the flavor. The Kiki Burger didn't need it and held up until the last bite. The textures enhance the experience. You bite the sweet bun and hit the crispness from the toasting until you encounter chewy bits of the carmelized bacon then the beef patty.

The other burgers offered didn't look as appetizing and the descriptions veered into Asian-influenced wierdness. A burger with kimchee? Maybe another time...

The burger by itself was $10, an incredible value given the inflated prices we'd been paying for food along the Las Vegas Strip. Fries are extra but one burger is more than enough unless you are a glutton or on a weight-gain diet.

I learned from doing a web search that Bachi Burgers is a little Las Vegas phenomenon with about ten locations. The manager told us they are opening their first location outside of Vegas in Los Angeles. Remember the name. If you are in 
Vegas, get off the Strip and make this a destination."}
{"text":"A great find, went in after the lunch hour rush, staff was very friendly and helpful. Not your traditional burger and the flavors was spot on, not overpowering and not just adding random toppings. So simply saying they know what they are doing. Spent $21 on burger, fries and my standard Arnold Palmer... 

I will be back next trip to Vegas, jealous of the locals that get to eat here regularly."}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because even though the food was good. The service was horrible. We didn't feel welcomed at all. We had a party of 9 and only 2 orders were served the way they were ordered. The waitress sucked. She clearly took the orders wrong and paid no attention to us. The woman who served us our drinks was way more pleasant than the lady that took our orders. At least she thanked us for coming. Due to the horrible service we didn't leave much of a tip. I'll stick to the Sahara location"}
{"text":"Went here around 4:00 on Sunday afternoon! Was able to get seated right away. thanks to two empty seats at the bar...but then the tradeoff came!

The entrees took a LONG time to come out!!! We didn't get our burgers till 5:00! All the while a couple sitting at a table next to the bar got their food and left before the burgers even came to the bar (Keep in mind said couple was seated 10-15 min AFTER us)! The server was profusely apologetic about the long wait but I chose to stay classy in the end despite the temptation to complain. For as long as they made us wait and how often they asked us if there was anything we can get, I would have appreciated a comp on desserts or drinks! People shouldn't have to shout/req to speak to manager/make a scene just to get noticed! After finishing the Portuguese donuts, I just wanted to get out of there! So much so I payed cash and told her to keep the $1 or $2 change! I would have liked to tip more because I truly enjoyed the free bird burger and our server's attentiveness, but that was a horrendous wait for the entrees! Yes I realize you had 3 or 4 groups over 5, but that doesn't excuse the fact that others received who came to sit after us (including a couple newly seated next to me at the bar towards the end of our burger noshing) received their entrees faster than we did!

I'm open to going back when there's absolutely nobody or if I place a takeout order in advance! Maybe then the wait will be less long."}
{"text":"I love Bachi Burger but their to-go service is a joke. I went on a Sunday afternoon when they weren't even busy, barely 3 tables seated. I called in an order of the entree sized Caesar salad with extra croutons and dressing and an order of the garlic fries with extra cilantro, jalapeños and dipping sauce all to go. I finally get home to see zero croutons and not a drop of dressing on the salad. The fries had 4 slices of jalapeño and maybe 1 leaf of cilantro. Now I'm stuck with a dry salad with no crunch relief and basically plain French fries with sauce. Thanks for ruining my Sunday lunch, Michael. I hope you don't do this to anyone else."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER EVER!!!

I wish Bachi Burger was located in SoCal.... Sigh...

I ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries with sun-dried tomato aioli and I almost inhaled those the minute I dipped that first fry into the aioli. 

Then came my Ronin burger and WOW. I want more! 

PLEASE COME TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA!!!!

-RM"}
{"text":"Burgers so good, it's orgasmic! Went here right after landing at the airport, very nice since it is so close. This restaurant is a must. I came there around 1:30 pm and there were still long lines at the front for tables. Very good sign that this place must serve some awesome food. Here is what I recommend


-Miyagi-san burger: so tasty and juice and exploding with flavor. the best burger i have ever had in my life
-Truffle fries: they put some kind of gravy sauce on top and it was positively divine
-pork belly bun: so moist and tender and full flavor
-duck buns: so good, equally as good as the pork belly bun

Service was good, price was a little expensive, but hey, for a lil piece of gastronomic heaven, I have no problem with the prices. =)"}
{"text":"Restaurant was full house so I've waited 15 mins befor getting seated. Everyone works for the place was super nice and friendly. I actually didn't feel like it had been 15 mins. Our waitress, Melissa, welcomed my group with big warm smile and explained menu items in detail since we let her know it was our first visit. We probably waited more than 20 mins for our food. However, its well WORTH the wait!! After my first bite of spicy miso burger, it made me want to sing at the table... yes it was just that good!! Angus beef was cooked perfectly. The medium cooked patty was very juicy and tender. I enjoyed the balance flavors between Japanese shishito peppers, egg and Angus beef. My salivary glands kick in overdrive when I tried to picture that burger and write this review. I also sampled Kiki's burger and Bachi house salad. They both tasted pretty awesome. I liked my Spicy Miso burger better. I was pretty impressed with their house salad. It came with pretty good portion and had mixed greens, avocado, walnuts and yuzu orange vinaigrette in it. This place has truely won 5 stars in my Yelp book with its mouthwatering food, friendly price and supreme customer services. I will be back very soon to try Shogun Burger (wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared miso foie gras, poached Asian pear, yuzu butter and yamamomo peach)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Waygu burger ($16) and garlic fries ($4).  I'd say the burger was average - slightly better than a McDonalds $4 burger but not as good as a $8 TGI Friday's burger.  I've had custom burgers at other places and they were much better.  At $16 I feel ripped off...  The fries also I felt were extremely expensive for what I got.  They were clearly not home cut fries but rather frozen fries.  For $4 I feel I should be getting something superior but I'd prefer $1 Mcdonald fries.  

Wasn't terrible but way overpriced for the experience.  Felt I should have paid around $10 instead of $20."}
{"text":"I feel a little guilty because I feel like I'm cheating on my favorite burger place in Houston (will be kept anonymous to avoid any breaking hearts). But, it was truly love at first bite. 

Got the Kiki because it was recommended by my fellow Yelpers (thanks guys!)  The bun was nice fluffy and sweet (like Hawaiian bread). Loved the dipping sauce that came with it! Burger itself had a hint of sweetness and I'm assuming it's from the carmelized onions. Bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, carmelized onions, and of course a tender patty nestled in a bun of perfection! 

Second time my table ordered:
 
Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50 - I could only really allow myself to have a few bites from this. Definitely massive enough to feed at least 3-4 people for an appetizer. Topped with a sunny side up egg and mixed in with chilli and bits of oxtail pieces. It was okay..definitely a good hearty app for the boys, but I probably wouldn't take the initiative to order it again. 

Pork Belly Buns $10-  Comes with three. Buns were nice, soft, and fluffy, and pork belly was cooked perfectly with a sweet glaze and topped with raddish and parts of a boiled egg. Definitely yummy and filling but I don't know how I feel about it being $10. 

Manga Burger $13 (?) - Their specialty burger with scallops and crab? It was ...satisfactory..definitely not memorable enough for me to go into extensive details about it. Honestly, I enjoyed the Kiki a little more but my friend enjoyed the Manga because of it's unique flavor. Just get both, lol!"}
{"text":"As a recent resident to Summerlin I was pretty excited to find Bachi Burger here. The location is much larger compared to the OG location and the menu remains the same. The feel of this restaurant is definitely more family friendly as the other location gives off more of a trendy vibe. The food here was just as good as the original. Ox-tail cheese fries and wings are my favorites to order. I usually eat so much of the appetizers I take my burger to go, so I can tell you with confidence their burgers hold up well as a midnight snack. When we were there I counted 4 families with young children and I believe they had both booster seats as well as high chairs."}
{"text":"This place is very unique. Everything we got was delicious except it was a little too salty for my taste. I loved the ambience and the way they presented the food. We ordered the oxtail chili fries, no meat burger, and bun mi burger which were really good just a little too salty. What we really enjoyed was the donuts which came with coffee ice cream and a berry sauce. The three combined together in one bite was so delicious."}
{"text":"Still in love with Fukuburger, but this place was great. Nice setting delicious food and our server was went above and beyond helping us with our orders.

What I ordered:
Miyagi Burger, I will eat this again, lots of times."}
{"text":"Not as good for me. 2 and a half stars in my opinion. Worth a try but wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Well, went back to Bachi Burger for a second time.  It was Friday night and they were busy. We put our name in and was told \"about 20 minutes\".  Ok, we figured it as worth the wait. There was maybe 12-14 people already there in the small waiting area so we waited outside in the cold.  We told the young man seating people we would be outside the door.
After about 45 minutes we noticed everyone ahead of us was seated and the young man was seating people that came in well after we put our name in.  We approached the podium and questioned why new couples that recently arrived are being seated ahead of us?  The \"cluck\" replied \"Uhh...someone crossed your name off\" ???   Well he was the only one we ever saw seating people and taking names.   Instead of immediately seating us he said he would put us back on the list.  Amazing !!!   Can't this restaurant find someone that can handle taking names and seating people properly and efficiently???   We left.....and \"NO, we will never return.\""}
{"text":"Great food and clean restaurant. Love coming here for the Kiki or myagiburger and truffle fries. If only service was a little quicker then I'd give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Horrible. Bad service, cold food, frozen fries and overpriced. I waited 30 minutes for a seat in an empty restaurant. Seriously, two tables had guest and the rest of the tables were empty. I wrote a note on back of my recipe along with my phone number telling of my bad experience.  Needless to say my comments were never followed up on."}
{"text":"Again a solid meal last nite. Me and my date ordered the pickled veggies, salt & pepper fries, truffle fries, Kiki and Mr. Ho. She loved the Kiki and truffle fries, but wasn't used to the medium rare flavor of beef-pork patty in the Mr. Ho. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome! 

My housemate and I went for a late dinner before their closing and it was great.  It's a really tiny place, but even at 1am it was still busy.  I liked the simple decor with really awesome art on display.  Our server was a real sweet guy too.

I got the Spicy Miso Burger (the special) and it was SOOOOOOOOOO tasty.  It was the best spicy burger I'd ever had.  It had a fried egg that was cooked to perfection. The sweetness of the creamy yolk went really well with the spiciness from the peppers and sauce.  The bun was soft, but crisp in between from the grill.  It's super messy, but all in the right ways.  This NEEDS to be permanent on the menu because I want to eat it every time!

I also got the garlic, salt, and pepper french fries, which came with a spicy mayo sauce.  It was super good especially with the burger.  Very garlicy, but delicious.

My friend got the short rib steamed bun and I tried one (it came with three).  It was a great combo of flavor.  The meat was delicious and tender and the vegetables complimented the flavors.  The radish gave it a freshness that was just indescribable.

She also got the plain fries and I tried the sauce that came with it and was surprised.  The pineapple ketchup is surprisingly un-pineapple like.  It's sweet and a good compliment to the steamed buns.

We also got the Portuguese donuts dessert. It was sooooo good. The donuts are fried to order and go amazingly well with the icecream.  Together it tastes like a deconstructed fried icecream.  Really great.  I'll definitely order it again.

Great place...I'm going to try to go there again this week!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is such a unique place. The oxtail chili fries are essential for every visit.
There are a wide variety of appetizers and entrées. I had the Shogun Burger which has wagyu beef, foie gras, and unagi for only $26!
The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Luv their burgers! They are soo tasty. Great for date night or family night. The waiters and waitresses were super nice and helpful. The greeter wasn't all that friendly but everything else was on point!"}
{"text":"Great burgers for a reasonable price. Also the artisan fries are some of the best I've had. Skip the sangria as it was lacking. Service was also alright. Will most likely go back."}
{"text":"Came in after searching Yelp for a burger place. And WOW! GLAD WE DID! We had the build your own and added an egg which was phenomenal!  From the patty to the bun everything was fresh and tasty! We also had the pork belly sliders and some truffle Parmesan fries which were also amazing. Then we had the Portuguese donuts which were.served with coffee ice cream!  Yummy little fried dough balls rolled in cinnamon sugar! Be heading back there in a couple days..it is that good!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. It was a recommendation by one of my friend and it didn't disappoint. I got the Miyagi Burger (wagyu beef FTW), pork belly buns, & the green tea pineapple with mint leaves. The burger just melts in your mouth and I love that their is a hint of sweetness to the beef. The pork belly was crispy and the buns was nice and soft, love the juxtaposition of the textures. The drink was not bad, it should have gone with something else. I wanted to try the oxtail fries she. I come back! Our server Palm was nice, helpful, and patient with me as it was my first time. Place is always busy so be ready to wait. Definitely coming back here on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Really good food!!! Our hamburgers were delicious!!! Really cool vibe, great service! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Love the burgers and oxtail fries! I first seen this restaurant on the food network. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food here is really good!! A little pricey for what I'd typically pay for burgers, but it's so delicious. Their burgers are huge, juicy, and definitely shareable. 

On separate visits, I tried the Spicy Miso Burger & Ronin Burger and both were good! I also ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. It was just okay for me. 

It's restaurant style type of dining, so they can be a little slower in service one would expect at a burger place.

Overall, I like this place & I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to have a great burger, Bahn mi burger is my favorite meal ever, I tried this place 3 years ago, in Vegas I leave in LA and every time I come to Town is a must for me, I found out that there was one in LA but didn't taste the same to me, I rather wait for me to come to Vegas  but today the service definitely was desapointing, we got sat right away because they weren't busy and after 15 min of seeing a server swinging by at least 4 times I stopped him to ask him if he was going to be our server? He just said yes I'll be right with you, seriously? ??????
Then the Manager came up to the table to introduce himself and asked us if we have been helped, then he took our drinks order and brought them himself, he then ask if we ware ready for order and took the order himself. The Server only brought the appetizer fries, this was thefirst time he would have a word with us, later someone else brought our food, the manager once more came to check on our table, I have to give it up for him he rocks and was very polite and friendly, but the server seem to be ignoring my table because I saw him interacting with his other tables, anyway  I still going to this place because I love the Food but I would just going to be mentally prepare to know that my service might suck. I am a Server myself and understand that sometimes you are busy but at least you should go to your guests and introduce yourself to let them know that you are aware that they chose yor location to bring their business. 
He could it make a decent tip if at least he would it told us his name and smile, but O well,  I hope next time is better."}
{"text":"Wish I could review the food but can't.... Was seated with a friend at 9pm tonight, hostess was very friendly. Unfortunately after 15 mins no one even acknowledged us at the table. We left. :("}
{"text":"Burgers with an Asian flair... what's not to like!  I got the Spicy Miso Burger.  It wasn't spicy, but boy was it flavorful!  Some may think it's a little salty but I happen to be a salt fanatic so I thought it was perfect! We also got the garlic parmesan truffle fries.  And after devouring that, we had to try the oxtail chili cheese fries as its seems all of my fellow yelpers raved about those fries!  They were outstanding!  The only thing though is that I like my fries thicker.... the fries were skinny and thin - like McDonald's fries.  I prefer the crinkle fries or something at least that thick but nonetheless the flavors were still amazing!  The prices are somewhat high for burgers but that's because you're not just getting a burger. It really is a meal.  And this is not your typical burger joint - it is a restaurant.  So no it's not a counter where you order your burger and have your own tray and take it to go or sit inside.  It's a restaurant with a menu and servers....probably why it's a little more pricey as opposed to let's say In and Out. But if you like burgers, then you have to give Bachi Burger a try."}
{"text":"It used to be really good, but I must say, I was a bit disappointed with their new menu system. Sweet potato fries were good, but I really did not care what is becoming with so many different stack up pile hamburger. I used to love it but now... it is becoming a so so burger... burgers do not have to me to tall or decor with high cholesterol or more calories... plus greasy. It started noodles - actually took over or combined next door noodle shop. We were party of 7 and 2 of us tried the noodle... was tasty, salty and moreover... served actually NOT hot but luke warm.  Disappointed. Loved what they used to be...

I do not think I will go back."}
{"text":"BOMB ASS FOOD.
The chili chicken appetizer is good stuff. Also The truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries are to die for. Every time I went I got the Kiki Burger. And it was perfection. However, I've tried bites of my friends burger's: the Ronin and the Kalbi Burger. It was all so good. Next time i go i'm going to get the Bahn-Mi Burger because I heard it was REALLY GOOD.
We had two different bottles of sake, filtered and unfiltered. I liked the unfiltered (in the pink bottle). The server was really knowledgeable on his stuff. He was the one that recommended it. They now carry alcoholic beverages. They didn't when they first opened. 
They have some really good Boba, but I wouldn't suggest getting it with your meal because it will just fill you up. So get it to go or something.
Also the desserts are really good. I've had the doughnuts and the bread pudding. But I think they've added more to it. 
I like how it is open late too! 
I can't wait to go back again.
If you go, ask for Lantz or Lentz. He looks like Jimmy Fallon, but he always gives me and my guests some awesome service."}
{"text":"The service is why I am giving this place 2 stars. The food offered is nothing new when it comes to niche burger joints, the quality and taste were very good I must say. Service both times we've been here however was lacking in sincerity and in execution. We ordered for desert the chocolate/peanut butter Souflee which takes 20 minutes to come out. When that desert came out out other desert hadn't came out yet. Another 15 minutes passed and still no second desert ( Portugese donuts and gelato). When I brought this to their attention and said I no longer wanted the desert then 2 minutes later it came out. I was so upset at that and that there was no apology or explanation so i just payed my bill and left."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile. I finally went here for a last minute birthday dinner. The unfortunate part is I've been looking forward to trying the burgers, but I had one somewhere else for lunch so I wasn't in the mood for another.

No worries though, Bachi Burger has a full menu with quite a few options besides their extensive selection of unique, gourmet burgers. I'm actually kind of grateful I didn't want a burger this time, because I ordered the Bachi Fish sandwich, which I probably never would have ordered from a burger place. It was awesome! Wonderfully soft bun, perfectly seasoned, seared cod, veggies, tarter sauce. 

My wife did get a burger so I was able to try a bite of hers and it was not disappointing at all. The beef here is high quality and well prepared. I'll definitely be coming back to have one of the burgers.

The salt and pepper garlic fries were incredible. Served with chili aoli, topped with sliced jalapeños and diced green onions.  Some of the best fries I've had in awhile.

This place would be near perfect if it had a better draft beer selection. They only had Sapporo on tap. There is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they're terribly overpriced for a bottle. Unfortunately I went without a brew during my visit.

Overall I'm digging this place.."}
{"text":"The food was great however... The service was horrible. I went with friends the last hour they were open and there were only 3 other tables that were finishing up. My glass had a lipstick stain and was dirty, I asked for a new glass. Instead It appeared I got my same glass back but the rim was wiped off. Sorry but no one likes lipstick stains on their glass! Maybe it was because they were closing soon but that shouldn't mean that their service should go down. I've also been to the location on Windmill and although they're packed quite a bit of the time their service doesn't suffer because of it."}
{"text":"Service was great! and The food was amazing! And not too expensive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to return to this place after having an awesome burger 2 years ago while in town.  Burger was burnt on outside, overdone and dry on the inside. Fries lacked flavor, and wife's ramen was blah. Disappointed  to see this place fall so much in quality of their food."}
{"text":"My family and I loved Bachi Burger before, for the great food and service. Unfortunately, both have been lacking the last couple times we've been here. We were a party of 5 and came in during dinner rush on Sunday. Our server was nice, but our drink/food runner had much better service skills and was more attentive than our server was.

The drinks came out quickly (thanks to the awesome food runner, these two stars are for you). We ordered 2 types of fries and the Japanese Sausages as appetizers. Those came out in a timely manner. The sausages were disappointing, as they are not the same and too greasy.  Our server might've forgotten us, because he took our order much later. We ordered 3 burgers and 2 salads with chicken well done.

This is where the experience really goes downhill. 2 other tables received their burgers before we did, and they were sat much later than our table. Our burgers finally arrived, but the salads had not. By this time, the place had cleared of the dinner rush.

We waited a little longer, and half our table was almost finished with their meal. I got up to speak with the manager and cancel one of the salads.  Since when does a salad take longer to prep than the burgers? I understand we ordered the chicken well done, but salads normally come out first regardless. As I talk to the manager, the salads arrive. One was sent back because that person in my party lost her appetite with the long wait. The manager said the food took longer because of the well done chicken request. We didn't order a well done thick piece of steak that takes much longer cook time. A small piece of chicken doesn't take that long to cook well done. 

I was not pleased with his response to default to our preference as the cause of the issue. The manager was kind, he offered to take the cancelled salad off the bill, and said he would box the salad up to-go. I was satisfied with that, until the manager dropped the bill off with a quick, \"sorry for the inconvenience\" and forgot the to-go salad he promised... We paid the bill and made our getaway, it wasn't worth bringing up.

The restaurant's severe lack of kitchen and food order management needs to be addressed. You have fresh ingredients and things take a little longer to cook, I understood that as a frequent guest of your restaurant. But the way this was handled was insincere, and mediocre at best. This will be the last time I bring anyone here."}
{"text":"If you like to venture and eat foods that are outside the box, this is a must for you.  Angus beef, shrimp and pork equals a banh mi burger!  The beer selection is also awesome. On our way outta Vegas into Cali which is totally worth eating outside the Strip."}
{"text":"Yum! Ate here on my recent Vegas trip and it was definitely worth it. This restaurant is located about 4 - 5 miles from The Strip but the drive is not bad at all. My friend recommended trying this place out and it did not disappoint. This was by far the best thing I ate on my trip to Vegas!

I had the Kalbi burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. I also got to taste the Ronin burger, and the pork belly steamed buns. All of them were excellent! I would recommend all of them. Bottom line: Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

The Kalbi burger was great. I asked for it medium well and it was perfectly done. The bread itself was soft and buttery, the beef patty was moist and tasted amazing! It also had kimchi as well as some lettuce. It has a wonderful combination of Korean flavors with picked cucumbers on the side! Everything about this dish was excellent and I would come back for more!

The Oxtail Chili Cheese fries were also great but I could have done without it...although their fries were amazing! Crunchy and not overly cooked.

Service was wonderful and our server was friendly and willing to explain everything!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to get some lunch here after a long 8 hour drive from San Francisco. My gf had gotten a couple people to recommend this place to her and she saw it on Diners Drive ins and Dives which convinced her to have to check it out. The place is a bit strange as it is combined with a ramen place next door, never really seen that before but it didn't conflict with my experience. We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries, wow were they great! A ton of delicious cheese and chili on top of thin cut fries. The meat and Asian jalapeño peppers gave it a nice kick as well.
For my entrée I decided to go with the Kiki burger. I decided to get the sweet onion marmalade on the side since I was a bit skeptical and I'm glad I did as it did not compliment the burger at all in my point of view. The meat was a bit more well done than I hoped but good none the less. The mushrooms really made the burger, great flavor and a good amount of them in the burger. Overall I had a good experience here and the price and wait time was fair. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Flat out my favorite burger spot!  I didn't even used to eat burgers until this place entered my life."}
{"text":"Um holy crap, these burgers are good!  Honestly there's not much more I can say in regards to this place this isn't summed up in that sentence but I guess I should back up a little bit first.  Being on a rare trip to the Southside of town with my mom, I pulled out my Yelp app (shameless plug) to find out what interesting place was nearby that I wanted to try.  Needless to say we were literally next to Bachi Burger so the decision was made.  

When we walked in we had to wait a few minutes since there quite a few large parties there that night but once were seated the pace was a bit quicker, although it still took a while for the burgers to come out.  Luckily for us the Assistant Manager was incredibly friendly and made sure we were at least attended well all evening.  

I ordered a Strawberry Boba Milk Tea while my mom had the Peanut Butter Chocolate Milke Shake.  While I liked my tea, in the end I wished I had gone with the rich milkshake instead.  We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries while we waited for our burgers, and their were tasty, but I don't think the combo really meshed for either of us.  Needless to say those went in the doggy bag for my brothers.  

When it came to the burgers themselves, I tried half of the Spicy Miso Burger and half Kiki's Burger.  The Kiki's Burger is pretty good but I found the sweetness level a little surprising and sort offset the rest of the burger for me.  It was the Spicy Miso Burger that was the real winner to me.  The pepper, the roasted garlic, and the egg all came together in a perfect combination!  Each bite was flavorful and amazing!  Needless to say it will be a conundrum for return trips whether I'll stick with this burger or see what creations they have concocted, but needless to say, I will return."}
{"text":"Owned by Hawaii people so, gotta support the islanders living local in this Sin City =)

The food was pretty good but, the better bang for your buck is to eat the \"make your own\" burgers. Sweet potato fries and spicy edamame were on point but, the truffle fries needed......maybe, more truffle oil???

My BIG suggestion is that Bachi Burger have late night; food and drink specials! 
With Island Sushi down the road with their own specials, Bachi Burger needs to compete and step up their \"specials\" game!!!


p.s. one of the owners is kinda hot....jus sayin'...nice view :p"}
{"text":"Ridiculously horrible wait time for over priced food. And then the server tells us they can't do individual checks for our group. It's 2016, if you can't act like a real business than maybe you shouldn't open a restaurant. Bathroom was a complete mess and no paper towels to dry your hands. Definitely not worth your time or money. Prepare to over pay for a completely average burger. Wait time to be seated was over 30 minutes and wait time for food was 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Call it Ono Burger instead of Bachi Burger because their Hawaiian-style burgers are so, so good.

Ever since Manapua Man closed shop about five years ago, I've been missing my favorite, chubby little hand held snack. Now it's back, split in two, double the price, and served with high-class condiments. Bachi's steamed buns with kalbi short ribs, cilantro and aioli is like gourmet Manapua. For $9, they didn't quite fill me up, so I suggest you go Hawaiian style: convince your buddy that she wants fries, soda, and dessert, then start bummin.'

The homemade sodas ($3.50) are the best I've ever had. Bachi also offers a small but delicious selection of beers--Rogue Hazelnut Brown being one of them (thanks Joe W.).

I highly recommend the Kiki Burger and the steamed bun dishes. I wouldn't waste stomach space or expense on the fries--just bum them from a friend."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, what would stop you from heading down to bachi burger and seeing what all the hype is about?

But no no it's no hype. The food is actually, in my opinion delicious!
We started with the oxtail fries, because after so many reviews about it and on top of that who doesn't love oxtail! Seeing the pictures made me want to dive in. Of course I took a picture myself. It was a perfect balance of crunchy from the fries and softness of the oxtail meet that was laid on top and the egg is perfect to balance out all the flavors. I'm not much of a heat fan so I just dismissed the jalapeños. Btw, this order is pretty big. It was perfect for my friend and I and then some but it was just the two of us so the more the merrier.

Then we ordered the Kiki burger, medium. It was nice and warm when it came out and we took our pictures for Instagram of course. Then we both dove in. The bun was nice and soft and it was toasted on the inside. Veggies looked like a spring mix and that sauce on the side had hints of citrus and sweetness that made the burger even more delicious. 

Reason for the 4 stars being that the service was not great. I felt like we were being rushed and it took forever to get a refill on our water, I guess it was because it was getting a little busy but that doesn't mean that you start being rude to your customers, even if the food is great. You'll eventually lose people that way or we'll end up going to another location. But the food is the real star of the show. I wouldn't go to this location again, I'd rather go to the other location even if it's further."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30pm, and the place was pretty packed. It's a casual burger joint, with a Japanese twist. We waited about 15 min for our table, there were three of us. After ordering, it did take about 50 minutes for our food. I ordered the Bachi Caesar Salad, and Sweet Potatoe Fries to share. My friend ordered this Pesto Burger and said it was excellent! I can't remember what my third guest ate, but he said he hadn't had a burger that good in a while.

The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it took 50 minutes to get our food (we noticed, because we were especially hungry that night). Also, our waiter and the water filled guy kept checking in with us to make sure everything was alright.... AFTER WE HAD RECEIVED OUR FOOD. It was pretty funny because they checked in with us about 4 times (not an exaggeration). 

Burgers are good, but don't go here if you're in a rush. Oh, decent prices too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service door took really long to be served. Waiters terrible, never asked our table once for refill of water even though cups were empty. They also forgot part of our order.  Will never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Lack of cocktails (especially for a place open late).

LIKE  The overall menu concept. Apple-lychee soda. Ronin burger. The Lonely Bird. Open 'til 2am. The white chocolate gelato that came with our \"pop tart.\" Our funny server.

LOVE  Sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Wow!! This is the gourmet of burger restaurants. I've never had a burger her that wasn't excellent. I rate these guys higher than my other favorites, Smashburger, five guys, and fatburger. It's a bit pricier, definitely landing in the $$ category, but definitely worth every penny. This is a must try restaurant if you consider yourself a foodie"}
{"text":"Order the waygu burger with blue cheese and mushrooms and bacon medium rare. Burger was over cooked and the mushrooms and bacon were like rubber. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is quite good. Very surprising! I had a server names Alex and he was quite awesome with his menu suggestions. 

This place is an Asian fusion burger joint. Great burger options. I like the miyagi san or spicy miso the best. My wife likes the Kiki but it is more sweet than I like. 

They have some great fries and onion rings!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness is this the best thing I've ever put in my mouth?! YES! I came here after reading other reviews and I have to say it blew my expectations out of the water.  I'm slowly working my way through the menu but my favorite so far is the Kiki burger.  What I like about Bachi is that they take a lot of very powerful flavors such as bacon or blue cheese and mix it with more delicate flavors of mushrooms or miso and you can taste every single ingredient and they compliment each other so beautifully.  It's a balance of flavors that few chefs are able to accomplish. The burgers are so moist it almost seems a shame to put the sauce they make for your specialized burger on but you must! It makes all the flavors pop.  Once you're done, you wish you had room in your stomach for more.  My usual appetizers are the peking duck buns or the pork belly buns.  You can't go wrong with either and they both are so tender and savory you'll be licking the plate it came on. My usual sides are the parmesan truffle fries.  I had the oxtail fries and they just didn't do it for me.  They were heavy and I felt they had this odd almost bitter taste to them.  They looked like chili cheese fries. 

The service is always excellent when I go there.  The servers are all nice and want you to have the best experience possible.  During my last visit there, I had a server who was just recently hired and wow! They train their staff well because she knew all of the menu items and she was personable and attentive.

PS! I went there while they were filming the kitchen segment for Dinner's, Drive In's and Dives.  Although they weren't officially open, they were kind enough to allow my friends and I to order out.  I HOPE MY BURGER WAS ON THE SHOW!  Also, you better go there now before the episode airs in about 6 months because after that, you wont be able to get in the door."}
{"text":"Overpriced food that isn't worth it. Their Oxtail Fries Chili Cheese Fries are the nastiest fries I've ever had. Chili is a sweet meat mixture with beans. Asked for Medium Well burger and they gave over well done. First and last time coming here!"}
{"text":"Food is good here but what's up with the servers? You can tell most of them are not fully trained and they just lacked in customer service."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the edamame.  They were tiny.  They didn't have the nice big round soybeans.  Plus they over charged for them.

The burgers were good but not great.  I would go back if they open one in LA bit probably not in Vegas.  But if I had to wait to eat, I wouldn't go."}
{"text":"On the Bone Marrow appetizer, the pineapple added a complimenting sweetness to this dish and they worked very well together. But I will say the Ox Tail fries will forever be my favorite dish here!!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is ruining my life!! Why? Well, it's because I'm so insanely jealous that it has captivated my boyfriend's heart in a way I never will. 

On our latest  trip I asked my boyfriend what his favorite part of our trip was. To give some background info, we spent a few days in Vegas, a day in Disneyland, and a couple days in beautiful Camarillo. If you had asked me which of these was my favorite part of the trip, I would've answered \"dancing with my wonderful boyfriend at a wedding\". His answer?! BACHI BURGER!!!

So apparently, Bachi Burger is better than Disneyland- the happiest place on earth. It is also better than anything we did in Vegas (including winning money). AND it is better than a couple romantic days lounging around with each other.

Fine, I suppose it's delicious, but sheesh- cut me some slack. It's not like I have a third pound of perfectly grilled wagyu on a house-crafted bun, a specialty sauce, or come with a side of truffle fries. I'm just me. Just human- not godly burger.

Anyway, the shogun is a $25 burger and it's super tasty and loaded with stuff (unagi, peach, foie gras, etc.) but i'm not sure it's worth the $25. I'd have to try it again to let you know. I really liked what I ordered, the Miso burger, but my boyfriend's Miyagi-san burger was REALLY good. So I guess I can forgive him."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and I am greatly impressed. The servers were very nice and prompt, the wait wasn't too bad but it would be great if they could fit in more chairs or put benches outside.
Now the food. Every single thing we tried was delicious. We started with the chili chicken appetizer and it was crispy and sweet while the chicken remained so juicy. Combined with the sauce that accompanies it, it tastes almost like eating hot wings. I ordered the Miyagi-San burger which was insanely good. The fresh buns are the softest I have ever held and my burger was cooked just how I wanted it. The fries are crispy and addictive and all the dipping sauces pack a flavor punch. Lastly, order a cocktail because they are all so delicious and make the experience."}
{"text":"We have been to the west Sahara Bachi burger many times, let ms say the burgers have always been excellent, now the service and the way they run the restaurant where they often have if not always more than half of the seating area closed, this is just atrocious when the waiting area is full and half of the restaurant is half empty. 
We made the mistake of going to the west Sahara location instead of the Russell location this evening and it's has been another horrible experience, loud, sitting elbow to elbow with strangers while half the restaurant is empty, slow service and staring at a full waiting area, I say management WTF! If this was the first time I would say they must be short on staff... It's a fluke.. It's not get your s--t together.
We stopped going to Bachi burger for a long time because of a previous experience like this... It will now be a long time to never before coming back to this location west Russell road it is.. The food is worth coming back just not here."}
{"text":"Delicious. We fly to Vegas just to satisfy our Bachi Burger crave. The ox-tail fries are a must !!! The burgers leave you so satisfied you might just need a nap after!"}
{"text":"The burger was okay. I had the $13 Wagyu. The flavor, bun, and veggies were good but the burger was over cooked and almost burnt on the outside - I ordered \"medium\" which it was not. The ketchup for the fries was good, so were the fries. The ketchup has a pineapple mix, which is actually good. Overall it doesn't shake a stick to Bobby's Burger Palace IMO."}
{"text":"Lots of hype but I've had egg on a burger before. Tasty burger cooked perfectly but still a burger. The oxtail fries were fun but rather boring."}
{"text":"Featured on diners drive-ins and dives Guy Fieri couldn't have said it better awesome burger choices at a great price. If anything you have to go just for the oxtail fries."}
{"text":"GREAT LOCAL FIND! Good place to eat. I love their drink selections, and their food. I'm a big fan of kimchee and beef so my favorite burger has to be the Kalbi burger. I also like the Ronin burger. I mean who doesn't love fried egg and katsu in their burger. Right? Their fries are awesome! I recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome. LOADED with flavor. Very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that. If you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries I'd say the sweet potatoes. Those go really well with the Kalbi burger. I also might suggest that you try at least ONE drink that isn't a coke or pepsi product. Their beverages are one of a kind, and tastey. So be brave! Try one of them. The feel of the place is very simple, hip, and urban. Easy enough. It doesn't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip. So if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service. Try it! I swear it is an experience!"}
{"text":"AMAZING burger.  The kimchi burger, that first bite was FREAKIN amazing.  My burger with the egg and fried onions on top was not as good- DEFINITELY get the kimchi burger- it sounds weird, but it was delicious!!!!  It's the most unique (and best tasting) burger on the menu I think.

I actually ordered the pork buns which were disappointing for dinner, and after taking a bite of my friend's, decided to order a burger.  The pork for the pork buns was not cooked well, was super fatty (not as meaty), I would not get this again. The oxtail chili fries were good, but nothing extraordinary (couldn't taste the difference between oxtail and another meat), a nice way to start off the meal!

The Kimchi Burger- the flavor of the kimchi, plus the meat, with a slight sweetness, was soooo good, a MUST GET!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have gone to this place since it's so far from the strip, but my co-workers and I were at a conference for work and wanted something good to eat. One of my co-workers brought this place up. So we all met up and took taxi. It was about a $20 cab ride.. When we got there we had to wait for 15 minutes.. We looked at the menu and there were a lot of things we wanted to try. 

We started off with Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. It was spicy because of the Jalepenos, but it was so good and flavorful!! We also ordered regular fries which was mediocre and shrimp chips that reminded me of my childhood, which was a plus! 

I ordered a Thai Iced Tea at a burger place. I had better Thai Iced Teas.. Then I ordered a Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which had an egg, bacon, and onion strings! It was so good! I ordered it Medium and it was perfect! It was so juicy and lean.. 

The only downside about this place that it's far from the strip so we waited almost 2 hours for a cab to pick us up. There are no cabs in the area so who would want to leave the strip when the money maker is on the strip."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and unique, which is why I keep coming back even though the service is sporadic at best. Even ordering for pickup is a hassle and unreliable. They just need either new or better management and they would be perfect. I really hope they change it because I want this place to stick around."}
{"text":"I don't rate 5's at all but this time I had to.

The atmosphere here was very cool.  Contemporary music playing at the right levels, fast friendly service.

The water is pure water.  I did not detect any chlorine in the water or the ice cubes.  Huge plus in my book.  The iced tea was fresh black tea and the best I've tasted anywhere.  Other tea flavors were available but I'm a black tea lover.

I got the Spicy Miso burger which was confirmed by Bobby, our server, as a good choice.  The fries were skinny fries and were crunchy with a hot soft center.  Very flavorful with a hint of lime.

The burger was beyond good.  I've never had a burger this good and 5 Guys Burgers and Fries used to be my number one burger."}
{"text":"Thank god this place is opening a location off Sawtelle in Los Angeles because they've got juicy delicious burgers here.

Shogun Burger:
The burger I must say is super over priced. $26 bucks! Apparently if you order a Wagyu Burger Meat (Their specialty meat) its $16 alone + whatever it is you are ordering. But the meat itself was cooked in a way where it was really juicy but also made me think of a house bbq with good company except the meat is much more marinated in its own type of flavor. Not overly juicy but not super dry. The perfect burger as I would describe it. It came with a small purée peach just to clean your pallet before taking an enormous bite into that burger.

Pork Belly Buns:
If you love pork.. You are definitely going to love this bun. This chunk of pork belly in a bun bao is juicy. Soft. Delicious. You cannot go wrong with this appetizer. Yum!


Mushroom Truffle Fries:
The sauce was delicious. Dont be on a diet trying this place out because youre totally going to regret it lol"}
{"text":"Wow the food they serve here is just so damn tasty and juicy!!! The fries were amazing and so was the burger the flavored have so much of a kick it's literally a party in your mouth! I will be a return customer

{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've had , if there's anything people misconstrue about Bachi Burger is that they expect a typical \"In-N-Out\" burger. Well wake up... It's an Asian infusion restaurant . Pretty much the whole restaurant has that vibe. The moment people discover that Asian infused food require a
Much more complex and acquired taste, that only those who know the honest delicacies of \"food\" will know. On top of it all the best server to give me this experience is the man that goes by Marquis. He makes this restaurant glow, and without him the vibe will never be the same! Keep it going Bachi! Awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Least favorite burger in Vegas. I am allergic to wheat and gluten free options are very limited. Not a fan."}
{"text":"My visits at restaurants featured on Food Network typically translate into unpleasant experiences. Bachi Burger, though, is one of the rare exceptions. 

After arriving in Las Vegas, we were famished and decided on Bachi. It was actually quite premeditated, to be honest. Needless to say, we walked right in, at just the right time before the impending rush, and snagged a table. 

Bachi offers some of the most inventive burgers imaginable. I sat for at least ten or so minutes agonizing over what to select. Finally, after drooling all over the table, I decided on Kiki's Burger, an Angus beef construction of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, an onion marmalade, and Gruyere cheese. My thought process was that the Gruyere would offer a nice balance to the sweetness of the marmalade. Unfortunately, it didn't function like I hoped it would; the burger was much too sweet for my liking. To Bachi's credit, they did cook it to a perfect medium. I don't fault them for my reaction to the burger -- it was just a miscalculation on my part. Next time, I'll be sure to select a burger that is made up of mostly savory ingredients. 

Visiting Bachi without also trying the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries would be very unfortunate. Not your typical chili cheese fry dish, to be certain. In fact, it's more like an oxtail poutine. It arrives served with a fried egg on top that you are left to bust open so that all the yoke smothers the pile of potatoes. It's also lightly accented by a few jalapenos and chopped cilantro to give it a little heat. Indeed, it was my favorite part of the Bachi experience and will surely make anyone come back for more.

I agree that a San Diego location would be a welcomed addition. Please??"}
{"text":"Bachi burger has excellent food. The waiters or waitress are very attentive. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten around for a Great Burger and Bachi Burger on Sahara and Ft Apache and the Bermuda/Windmill location both have Consistency Great service and Superb Gourmet Quality?
My favorites are the chilly covered sunny side egg green onion Sweet Potato fries any of the gourmet burgers are awesome followed by peanut butter chocolate soufflé?
Ps the Pear Blackberry Fox Ale is Great...

My personal recommendation is too Fast all day and eat here at 4 o'clock and that's your meal for the day--"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing ! Enjoyed the burger along with a tasty Margarita ! We must have gone at a good time because it was pretty empty and our server Alex was awesome and friendly especially with being first timers !"}
{"text":"We saw the menu online today  and decided to go check out the restaurant. The prices ended up being way different, a bit overpriced to be honest. We ended up getting the Kiki burger which was alright and then we got the garlic sat and pepper French friend and those were actually pretty bad. After eating a couple of those your tongue starts burning and gets kinda sore. 
I wouldn't really go back to bachi burger"}
{"text":"Well its been almost 2 years since my last visit to Bachi Burger and it still lived up to what I remembered. ..amazing asian style burgers..Every place I had in Chicago always made me crave Bachi Burger..its definitely a go to place when I come to Vegas..Glad its still doing well and hope they can be around for a long time. I Do need to check out their other location next time."}
{"text":"After waiting in a nearly empty restaurant for 30 minutes for a kale salad and a burger, I left.  When the food did arrive,  no explanation or apology was offered to my husband who waited for his burger.  This is the third or fourth time we have eaten here, always at off hours, and the service has always been slow, but not this slow.  Too bad because everything I have eaten there is good."}
{"text":"Husband: \"Let's go to this new place.  They have Asian hamburgers.\"
Me: \"What the hell is an Asian hamburger?\"

Thus began my discovery of the Bachi Burger.  Located in the Village Square on Sahara and Ft. Apache that is trying its darnedest to recover from a slew of closed businesses, I think Bachi Burger is going to be one of the flagship places in that renaissance.

SERVICE:
Very attentive.  Also, the host guy who sat us is hot, so that's always a plus.  We had about 4 people who work there come up to us and ask if everything was to our liking.  I really admire that when restaurants have multiple people checking on tables, so you don't have to search out your server if you need anything.

DRINKS:
They have some really cool, interesting sodas (that I think are made in house, but not 100% sure on that).  They also have many shakes, and sake inspired drinks.  I did try a glass of the sake-sangria, which I thought was pretty weak.  I wouldn't get that again, but would definitely get one of the before mentioned sodas or shakes on my next visit.

FOOD:
Ok, listen.  You need to get the oxtail chili cheese fries.  It's like a piece of art when it comes out, and there is a freaking egg on top like a cherry on a sundae.  Spicy, meaty, tangy, cheesy, and huge (it could feed 4 people easily).  Burgers were top notch.  I got the Mr. Ho's Burger, which came on a taro bun!  What?!?!  I don't know what Taro is, but I went for it.  It had a slight purple tint to it, but was super tasty.  The burger also has a nice heaping helping of mushrooms on it and the Hoisin sauce was on point.  My husband got the Ronin burger and asked for it medium rare, and by God, they made it medium rare perfectly.  Nice and bloody, not overcooked.

VENUE:
We went on a Friday night at 7:00 and there was ample seating, which surprised me.  I thought it would be packed.  Maybe people don't realize it's open quite yet?  Fine by me!  That means less of a wait for me to get another delicious Asian hamburger."}
{"text":"Sorry however I did not think the burgers were as good as people have said.  We ordered the burgers medium they were dry and sweet in taste.   The oxtail Chili fries had more beans and hardly any oxtail meat.   Server was okay.  Would not go back or recommend to friends to even try."}
{"text":"Our group was excited to experience this place after watching DDD. The food was pretty good but the service was too slow and my food was cold probably will not be returning. If you're in a rush, I suggest you go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great burgers, everything was tasty just don't go in expecting a cheese burger, the food i had looked like a burger but tasted like an awesome Asian mashup of a burger."}
{"text":"I've FINALLY tried this place (just getting around to writing the review now) and let me tell you, BELIEVE THE HYPE! There's always a wait (about 15-20 mins both times I've been there) which tells you the quality of the food but after actually tasting their burgers I'd gladly wait 30 minutes for a table here.

Their burgers are huge so I've never ordered appetizer, however I did try one of their milkshakes and that was way too sweet (I still finished it). I always get the Miyagi-San burger which according to our server is the most unhealthy and consequently most delicious. He's right. I've tried the Shogun and Spicy Miso and I just keep coming back to it!"}
{"text":"My, oh my. Get anything that the waiter/waitress recommends. Like any burger with Wangyu beef (however it's spelled). 

Watch out though, it could get pricey really fast. like.. $50 for two fast."}
{"text":"Amazing food but be prepared for the price-tag. Everything is À la cart so it can add up fast! My husband and I got the Pork Belly Steam Buns, Salt and Pepper Garlic fries and the Spicy Miso Burger and the bill was over $30.  However it was absolutely the best burger I have had in recent memory and we will be definitely back :)"}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had in my liiiiife: Miyagi sans grass fed wagyu burger. Seriously, order it and be happy.

Great service & beverage options. Their ube boba shake was delicious! I have to come to this place every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"3rd time here, last time service was slow, hoping that has changed, guess what? It is a big \" no\"! @2 pm, lunch rush was almost over, still had to wait over 1/2 hr for a burger & bowl of ramen. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and did not disappoint! Took off 1 star because we had a long wait, but the food really was worth it!!

Our table ordered so many different items and every single one was delicious. Service was good once we were seated. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant did not live up to the hype. The quality of meat was good but overall the food was average. We ordered the truffle fries but we're disappointed once we tasted them. You do not taste any truffle oil, only the mushroom sauce they heavily drizzled on the top. Our server was great and let us switch out the fries for sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were much better though nothing to write home about. My boyfriend, a vegetarian, only had one option on the menu. His veggie burger was poorly made and was falling apart so much that he had to eat it with a fork.  My burger was dry and the flavor combination was just not enjoyable. Next time we are in the mood for burgers we will go to Steiner's instead."}
{"text":"Was in town and was recommended to this place. I was with a party of 6 and the place was not very busy. We were never greeted or told how long the wait was for the next table. There was an abundance of seats so I wasn't concerned with the wait. We had prompted several servers numerous times with no acknowledgment. We then approached the server with the hope of getting seated. They seemed completely oblivious to our presence. I would have liked to have tried their burgers especially after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately they failed miserably. I would like to have given them the benefit of the doubt but there was simply no excuse for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Ive always been a fan of Bachi Burger so of course I had to go check out their newest location. 

Ordered:

Ronin Burger, I mean this one is a Bachi classic. It has a fried egg in it FYI!! Its delicious. Order it if its your first time here.

Black and Green Burger, this was the first time i tried this one. What drew me to it was the bacon and the blue cheese. However im not a HUGE fan of blue cheese so it was nice that they were able to go light on it when I requested it. Even so, I forget how strong the flavor is. Lol the burger is great, definitely a blue cheese lovers choice. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Sooooooo good! Big portion too! Could share with a few people. 

For Dessert we got the Bread Pudding, it was good in terms that it wasnt too sweet however even after waiting for a while (i work in a kitchen i know how it works) because they were heating it up, we couldnt finish it because it just wasnt hot enough. The bread pudding was still cold in the center. Not room temp, cold. 

Other than that the service was great and over all the food was good."}
{"text":"The food here is decent with some good items. I used to come here at for the Bahn Mi burgers.  But past few times the service has been so spotty.  I always wondered why they seemed so empty lately.  I see now. This past visit the service was so bad I just had to leave. I'd try other locations because the food is good."}
{"text":"my favorite burger spot the miso burger was amazing the OX TAIL chile fries were bomb the wait was long but well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese fusion burgers that are very unique. I split a Ronin burger and the Kiki burger, as well as had the parmesan truffle fries and oxtail chili cheese fries.

The Ronin burger was very sweet and the mushrooms seemed to overpower the burger. I enjoyed the Kiki burger a lot more as there was a lot more flavor, depth, and texture. Also, bacon! The truffle fries could've used some work. It seemed like just fries with some mushroom sauce on it and very little to no parmesan. For the price, I would not order these fries again. The oxtail fries ended up being overpowered by the chili, and tasted like normal chili cheese fries you could get at say, Sonic's. It did, however, come with two perfectly fried eggs.

Overall, I would come here again just because the burgers were decent and they have a unique menu. But, some of their dishes need a little work."}
{"text":"I love coming here for burgers because they're consistent on their flavors and the way that they cook their burgers. The service is top notch and the place is clean. The burgers have gone up in price gradually over the years, but it's still worth the price. For this visit we ordered the Kiki Burger, Miyagi-san Burger, Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, and the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.

Burgers: Both burgers were amazing. They cooked them to a perfect medium-rare. The flavors for the Miyagi-san are so good that when you break open the egg, you want to dip it in the juices on the plate. The Kiki is also good with the mushroom and onion combo.

Oxtail Fries: I don't know if you can beat chili cheese fries with and egg on top. The flavors and ingredients are perfect together. This could be an entree on it's own.

Pork Belly Buns: These are always good. The pork belly is tender and the bun is soft. The hoisin sauce is a lot tastier than normal hoisin sauce you get at a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the BEST burgers I've ever had. The unusual combo of ingredients, the presentation and the mouth watering taste is 5 star burger!!!!!"}
{"text":"YOU NEED TO STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE. 

I admit I saw this place on \"diners, drive-ins, and dives\" BUT as annoying as I find Guy Fieri, the Food Network comes up with awesome places for him to review. This place is no exception.

The oxtail chili cheese fries are to die for. Seriously, what can be better than a delicious oxtail stew smothering perfectly crisp fries? A FRIED EGG. I can't really say anything else. I'm still salivating. 

The steam buns with pork belly were very good, not great. Don't get me wrong, they were very tasty, but the pork belly was a little dry and the fat was chewy - it didn't melt in your mouth.

We ordered a Mr. Ho burger which comes with a taro bun! A TARO BUN! It actually tastes like taro! Surprisingly delicious! 

The kimchi burger was perfectly cooked. The kimchi was delicious, and the pickled cucumbers were super authentic. 

Oooohhh! I almost forgot they have angry orchard ON TAP! And they have a fireball angry orchard cocktail. Yeah, I know - pretty perfect. 

Honestly, nothing I say can give you the experience of eating great food, with perfect music, a super friendly staff and epic urban graffiti decor. just come here!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around noon, got seated right away since we sat at the bar, the wait was 20 min otherwise. The restaurant has a cool feel and all the dishes were plated nicely. Everything tasted pretty good, but the flavors were quite strong and I didn't love anything so much that I would come back for it (since there are so many great eateries in Vegas)

Ordered:
Oxtail Chili Fries - These were good! Salty, it was perfect to share with 3-4 people before the burgers came out
Ronin Burger - Good, strong onion flavor
Keiki Burger - OK, strong sweet flavor

All-in-all, it was a good dining experience and if I had to go back I'd be interested in trying some of the other burgers. But I'd rather go to Serendipity 3 at Cesars Palace!"}
{"text":"Unique.  It is definitely worth a try.  Started with the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Can you say yummy? Next we tried the Bachi Pickles.  These pickled, mostly Asian vegetables, were great.  For the main course I had the Black & Green Burger (American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sautéed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon,Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roasted Garlic) with avocado.  The burger melted in mouth.  We, also, ordered the bacon fried rice from Shoku Ramen menu.  It was just ok, but glad I tried it.  Shoku Ramen is the sister restaurant of Bachi.  You can order from either menu."}
{"text":"3.5

I've been to their newer location and that place is definitely bigger. The wait here could be kind of crazy so better be prepared for that. Bar seating might seem fast but it is still quite a wait.

The burger and fries are delicious. I go the Spicy Miso this time and it was just as delicious as my other burger I tried. It is definitely on my top 5 burger places ever. If only the service was faster. Maybe they should just let customers fill out a form and take orders like that. Seems like their system is pretty slow."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is very good. When I was told this place beats Umami burger from LA I was pretty skeptical. Once I took a bite I was convinced. The buns were soft and toasted exactly the right way. I got the fish burger and it was so good and tasty. The fries although the waitress said was small it was perfect to be shared.

I don't think there is any doubt that this is hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. 

I'm definitely going to go back next time I'm in town.

Prices were very reasonable at about $10-15. It was a lot bigger than Umami and tastier too."}
{"text":"First impression last... Yes! Very much impressed first time we've tried this place. So glad we went before we move to Hawaii... Amazing burger selection and the different type os burger sauce are so refreshing; unique and super tasty. The truffle French fries is a winner.  Highly recommended!!!! Definitely will come back sometime again."}
{"text":"While kind of on the pricey side, it was well worth it for the amazing burgers that my boyfriend and I had here. Their oxtail chili French fries are also a must have! So delicious and large that the appetizer could be a meal in its own! Delicious food that tasted fresh, try also knew about common food allergies and were able to accommodate me without any issues. Will be coming back here in the future"}
{"text":"I believe the bar was set too high for me.  I had heard about Bachi Burger for years from locals and television but was greatly disappointed.  Firstly, if you don't like onions you won't like this place.  Secondly, the food was all a bit too much with odd assortments of ingredients.  Lastly, the prices weren't bad, however I'd rather go to a good old fashioned burger joint at cheaper prices than pay around $15 for a \"gourmet\" burger."}
{"text":"I wish I could say the food here was good, but good luck actually trying it. The hours are inconsistent so don't expect the place to be open when you arrive during advertised business hours. I would call ahead to make sure they are open before heading over"}
{"text":"I went to Bachi Burger because my co-workers were giving me a going away luncheon there. Service wasn't bad because we got there right when it opened. It started to get  busy after we left, so I can't say much after reading the other reviews about the wait.

Looking around the place, it looked like a modern, asian burger restaurant. The menu had very interesting creations. I was indecisive in choosing what to get. I had the lonely bird & we all shared the truffle parmesan fries. The fries were good w/ the sauce.  My burger  wasn't the best. They were reasonably priced considering they were gourmet burgers. All the burgers looked very appealing as far as having a great presentation goes. The lonely bird is a turkey burger w/ a teriyaki flavor. I guess I wasn't too fond of what I ordered. I like turkey burgers, but this is the first time I had it w/ an asian twist. I decided to try it just in case it was good. You never know, but at least I know now that turkey burger w/ teriyaki flavoring is not for me.  

One of my friends let me try her burger. I think it was called the black & blue. It was good. My bartender ordered the Crusty Crab & devoured it in like a couple mins. He said it was good & he would come back again. Everyone else had the Ronin & Kiki's burger. They all seemed to be enjoying the meal. I was enjoying the meal because I had great company. It was nice that they let us take group photos in there. 

I thought it was cool that they had many different flavored & unique beverages. I had the Jasmine lemonade tea. It was rather refreshing. Everyone seemed to like the lychee tea. 

The one thing I really didn't like about the establishment was when I had to use the restroom, their sink wasn't working. There was no water coming out. Hopefully they fixed this problem because it's a shame to be eating a meal w/ your hands & not be able to wash them prior to or after the meal. 

I would come again because their menu is unique, but maybe I'll wash my hands before arriving the establishment & bring extra sanitizing wipes."}
{"text":"Not my thing.  I'm not a fan of Asian fusion stuff, why I keep trying it I don't know.  

We started with the pickles.  These are not American pickles, but Asian pickles.  There was garlic, turnip, radish, cucumber, eggplant....I think I am forgetting a couple.  They all were pickled with different seasonings, so each one was different.  However, I didn't like any of them (to be honest, I hated them) although I tried each one.  Instant stomachache.

I ordered the no meat here veggie burger.  It is a veggie patty with fried tofu and fried eggplant, along with the usual fixins.  I tried to take a bite and burned my mouth.  Let it sit awhile (not long enough, apparently), and burned my mouth again.  Cut it in half, and let it sit awhile (steam pouring out, at this point my old man was just about finished with his burger).  Try number three - burned my mouth!  What the heck!

I'm still not sure if it was the fried eggplant or the fried tofu that was so freaking hot, but something on that burger came straight out of the fryer and onto the bun.  Way too hot to serve!  Bachi Burger is lucky I am not the litigious sort.

When I finally got to eat the burger, it was good.  I especially liked the bun, and the veggie patty part was really good and housemade.  I think it would be just as good without the fried tofu and eggplant, so if you're counting cals I'd order it without.  Price on the veggie burger could come down a notch.

Service was adequate.  They were really busy at 7:30 on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I'll start with the bad
Cons: 
Way Overpriced. Drinks are almost 5 dollars. Burgers are 12-16 dollars anddddd don't even come with fries! You're gonna charge me 16 dollars for a mediocre burger and can't even throw in some fries?! The straws are too short for the glass and I didn't even get my drink till 5 minutes after I ordered and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant. 
Pros: 
Food came quick. The burger was not that bad. That's it. 

All we ordered was two burgers and an order of fries and the bill ended up being $38.38. So 40 bucks down the drain basically."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some new spots out during my trip to Vegas and this place was recommended to me. It was pretty empty for 1pm on a Saturday. There was a larger party ahead of my cousin and me, however other than that there weren't many folks in the restaurant.

We ordered the truffle fries, oolong tea, matcha green tea, Kiki burger, and signature angus burger. Yoooo, we waited almost 35 minutes to get our food. There was no apology for the wait :( or acknowledgement of how long of a wait it was. It would have been helpful to have the waitress drop by, because at one point we were going to just ask for it to go after waiting so long. My Kiki burger was over cooked and I wasn't really feeling it. Truffle fries were okay. Matcha green tea was watered down :( The signature burger was bomb and wish I got that instead.

Overall, service could be better. Tables were left with leftover food for too long. Some people didn't even finish their food, mostly noticed the oxtail fries. It could have been in relation to the wait, not entirely sure, but it was lowkey alarming why so much food was left over. One of the booths literally was not fully cleaned during our entire visit there, so almost a whole hour unattended. It may have been short staffed? Only one waitress checked up on us to refill our \"bottomless\" drinks, but we decided to just get check the check and leave shortly after. I'd rate it a 3, mostly because service was lacking. I'd probably stick to another burger joint for my next visit."}
{"text":"So glad we found this while on vacation in Vegas! We heard a bunch of great things about this place, so we definitely had to check it out. Since I heard this place gets busy, I called ahead a few minutes right after they opened to see if there was a line. The lady said no wait, but once we got there (maybe 15-20) minutes later, there was a short 15 minute wait. This place can get super busy quick! As far as food, we started off with oxtail fries & the steamed pork buns, which were both amazing! I ended up ordering the Ronin burger which was cooked to perfection. In addition to the food, I ordered a honey dew boba. Eh, it was watered down & not worth getting.  Overall, definitely worth stopping by! :)"}
{"text":"We were just off the plane from a very long flight from the east coast and we were pretty hungry. My guy suggested bachi burger based on reviews on line. I must comment that this restaurant is super.  The waitstaff was more than courteous and accommodating . She explained a lot of the menu and we made our selections based on her selections which were spot on. The burgers were terrific and the salt and pepper fries luscious.  The Arnold Palmer was so so but we weren't there for the drinks anyway. Bachi is well worth your time if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been going to Baci burger for over five years now and tonight was definitely one of my best experiences ever.

The waitress was extremely nice, on point about absolutely everything, and service was very fast.

Not only was the service excellent, the burger that I built was unbelievably amazing as well.

I had a barbecue burger with double patty along with grilled onions, fried egg, tomato, lettuce, and bacon. Combined with the salt-and-pepper french fries, I was left extremely satisfied.

If you're thinking about trying Baci burger think no longer because this place is a late night homerun for sure!

I should also mention that there are several locations, this is by far my favorite location of all of them."}
{"text":"My favorite burger is the Miagison Burger, but now I'm trying to have everything on the menu at least once. This time I had the black and green burger. It was alright, nice and fresh, but I've never been big into blue cheese so it all depends on your taste buds.

Tip: Try the loaded fries with cheese, jalapeños, and chili!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints in Vegas!  Great burgers, great fries and other many other options too."}
{"text":"Great burgers and friendly staff. I'm definitely a fan!

Miyagi-San's burger (wagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings)
- I asked for it to be cooked medium rare, just as how I like my steaks cooked, but I think I'd like it medium next time. Burger was very juicy and tasty, the fried egg was cooked perfectly with the velvety yolk oozing when I cut the burger in half. 

Truffle Parmesan Fries (parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream, sun dried tomato aioli)
- I wish these were fried a bit longer, they were too soggy for me. Because of that, the cream made it taste more soggy.

They also have a ramen joint connected next door. Will be back to try their ramen!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Oxtail chili fries with great burgers.  I got the Mr Miyagi and my brother got the Bahn Mi, two great choices. Sadly they were out of the Ramen that day because of a plumbing issue, looking forward to trying it in the near future.

Updated.  Tried it again and it was amazing.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"This burger place makes me want to move to Vegas!!! I love the miyagi and the oxtail chili fries :)"}
{"text":"This place would give Umami Burger in LA a run for its $$. 

Recommend:
Shogun Burger
Miso Burger
Pork Belly Bao in the Peking Duck style
Pickled Onions

Did feel it for the truffle fries with gravy. Got cold fast...

This place is ALSO a Ramen House."}
{"text":"I love that it is right next to a movie theater, so my bf and I make a whole day out of it. It has a very relaxed atmosphere. The place is clean, and the staff is friendly. 

Oh, and did I mention the food there is amazing???"}
{"text":"Five star burgers. Just go.  Asian fusion theme with super quality ingredients and prices are amazingly reasonable for the quality provided"}
{"text":"Great food, but slow, understaffed and waitress who is very unprofessional and an attitude......"}
{"text":"I had to try to make it to Bachi Burger at least once this year.

And while I was a little tempted to order something different this time (was looking into getting either the Bachi Fish, Banh Mi Burger, Tsukune Burger), I ended up getting my all-time favorite burger, The Kiki's Burger once again!

Kiki's Burger -- http://bit.ly/2lhHfbU
Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli
It really is hard to resist!  The combination of the mushrooms with the bacon just add a serious amount of umami flavor to the burger.  

I also ordered their Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries -- http://bit.ly/2lg9CY4
No complaints with these fries.  Nice and crispy, garlic not too overpowering and the jalapenos added some heat.

It's really too bad there's not a Bachi Burger in the Bay Area where I'm from.  I think they could do very well there.  Plus I can go more often to try their other burgers and sandwiches.  But for now, it'll just be something I can build anticipation for whenever I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"We tried their kobe burgers. It was ok. The pricing is a little high for the quality which was average. The place is run down. You can see the wear and tear. For the prices, I expected better food and a more contemporary restaurant. The service was good though."}
{"text":"This place is one of my all time favorite burger restaurants. This is not your fast food burger joint. Bachi Burger is in a class of its own when it comes to burgers. 

Every time I drive through Vegas I find a way to stop by and get a Bachi burger. Be prepared to wait to get a table. The wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Ohhh goodness. My boyfriend has a timeshare in Las Vegas right down the street from Bachi Burger. Everytime we go, we devastate this place.

The burgers are gourmet, Japanese fusion burgers, but so delicious! First off, their quality of meat is great. The ground beef is very tender and juicy, not dry at all. They also offer so many choices of burgers that are so interesting! 

-If you really want to splurge, try the Shogun burger. It's the best burger I've ever had, hands down.
-Miyagi-san is definitely the best burger if you don't want to take risks. It's not bad, it's a GREAT burger! But if you're not feeling some of that fusion stuff.
-The Ronin Burger was awesome. It had so many layers of taste; my friends and I decided that it tastes somewhat like a sushi roll. Sounds weird, but it's really goooood.
-Kiki burger is a really good mushroom burger!
-Their oxtail chili cheese fries were HUGE. And delicious! However, like everyone else, I do wish for a bit more oxtail in it. But nonetheless, bomb.
-Their truffle fries are amazing too! Definitely my favorite truffle fries I've had yet. Not dry at all! Crispy and moist.
-Mr. Ho burger. If you like sweet taro bun and pork sausage, try it. It's a bit on the Chinese bun side, it was very interesting, but I couldn't finish it because it was a bit sweet for a burger.

Never had Umami Burger, but my friends at the table are quite the foodies and had quite of a bit of Umami Burger... Bachi blows Umami right out of the water.

Prices are around $9-$15 per burger (except the Shogun, that one is $25), but the burgers are HUGE. Eating just the burger alone, you'll be stuffed. Thick patties, fat bun. No skimping here.

Damn, now I'm hungry talking about all this food.

5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm all for a traditional burger, but the Asian twist is a refreshing and delicious change.  The staff are friendly and passionate about the food they serve.  Everybody that I've brought here loves it.  Favorite burger place in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"5 star for the food. We all got French fries and burgers and they were def some of the best we've had. They have a delicious chicken burger if beef isn't your thing. The server was not very attentive and was slow which is why I would not give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't believe this is the convention center location, but the convention center location is my experience.

Dry cheeseburger. Stale fries. Bland taste. Overpriced.

Fast, friendly service, though. I'll give them that."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, forget about in and out or ANY burger place, don't hesitate and come here!

Got tipped off by a guy at the rental car place to come here instead of in and out. Thank god we took his advice because the food was phenomenal! Oxtail fries are a must. The burgers were well cooked and artisanal, toppings did not really overpower and complimented everything very well. My next vegas trip, I'll definitely have to visit again!
Also, beware this place gets busy. We arrived 30 minutes after they opened and there was a line of about 12 or so already formed."}
{"text":"What a disappointing restaurant  this is!  If you have even the slightest sensitivity to salt, this is not where you want to dine!  I've been there twice for hamburgers, and yesterday for a turkey burger.  My brother ordered the same meal, and we did not enjoy it at all - every ingredient is loaded with salt, and he isn't salt sensitive!  We ordered a small side of cole slaw, which was not only salt-laden but had an offensive flavor.  We asked the server to take the slaw back and remove it from our bill, but when the tab came it was still on there, and she said it could not be taken off.  She got the manager, who said to us, \"we don't remove charges from bills here.  When I go out to eat and order something I don't like, I don't order it there again.\"  (yeah, right!  Imagine if we had sent our turkey burgers back and had to pay for them plus replacement meals!!)  He then decided to remove the charge - a whole whopping $1.50!!  They've lost our business forever!  Customer service is sorely lacking!

I also want to note that they are famous for their milk shakes, yet they only have one blender in which to make them.  So if two of you are dining, expect to see your milk shakes arrive 20 minutes apart!!!   Inexcusable in our book!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. I think this place is too hyped up. 

I tried the oxtail chili cheese fries with an added egg on top (sunny side up). It was okay. Not that mouth-watering where I had to eat more. I ordered the Ronin Burger which was good, but not great. There was another burger that I tried and it was not good.... too much goose liver flavor to it... blah. 

Anyways, this is a good place to try if you're a burger fan who likes Asian fusion stuff too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. Food was good. I tried the Banh-Mi burger and it was good. I do wish I would of tried one of the wagyu burgers like my son and husband, they tried the miyagi-san burger. It's was really good! The Brussels sprouts were incredible!!! The reason they aren't getting five stars, is due to service. It was a busy Friday night but had to ask for the Brussels sprouts after the waiter forgot them. Also, the kids cheeseburger comes with a milkshake. Here, the milkshake comes after the cheeseburger, not before or during. Which we found out after asking where my daughters milkshake was."}
{"text":"The burgers are potentially the best I've ever had in Vegas. Been here several times, alone or with others, and have enjoyed myself thoroughly each time.

Service is friendly, but unfortunately I haven't been here during a busy period to see what they can do under pressure. (I'm in the industry and would love to see this place kill it)

If you love great burgers, you'll love Bachi. Period."}
{"text":"Today...
Philthy reviews....the burger place that makes good fries and that Miyagi burger...

Tebasaki Wings:  If you are from West Los Angeles, Gardena, Little Tokyo, or Rowland Heights, then you know about Furaibo.  The undisputed Tebasaki spot.  These wings are not even close.  They have a sweet glaze that laced each bite.  The crunch was there though and I do always like crunchy wings, but the internal dryness detracted from the enjoyment.

Miyagi burger:  Crunchy onion rings, bacon, fried egg and wagyu beef...I don't see how anything like this could be bad and it wasn't by any stretch.  It was juicy and tasty like it should be.  The egg combining with the beef and bacon was like breakfast in every bite.  The soft bun just embraced it and lent to a great burger experience.  

Kids Chicken Tenders:  For some reason, these panko breaded chicken strips were freakin good.  My daughter massacres them but just eating the inside chicken and leaving all the batter, but we all ate the remnants which had tons of chicken left inside. They were oddly tasty.  Go figure. 

Garlic Fries:  Fries with a garlic twist.  Fried perfectly and flavored to a tee.  

Service:  This seems hit or miss at this spot.  I've read the 1 star reviews and saw service was the biggest complaint.  Not so much the food, but waiting and poor attentiveness/attitude were to blame for the poor experiences.  We must of came on the tail end of a bad day because we were not greeted for 10 min upon our arrival.  A crowd of 4-5 parties and dirty tables seemed to litter the restaurant.  It looked like they were overwhelmed and understaffed.  I can overlook this as I have worked in a restaurant but at least acknowledge people when they come in.  The server was good and talkative and apologetic for the wait/condition of the restaurant.  I appreciate gestures like that."}
{"text":"I think I was expecting too much from this place....my burger was dry and over cooked and the chili fries are definitely over rated!!!
Why can't these burger places make a juicy burger!!!!!!!!
I'm from the bay area and we have a spot called \"Super Duper\"! Talk about a tasty juicy burger:):)"}
{"text":"It has been years since I have tried bachi burger. But this time it was nothing short of excellent. Since it was National french fry day I had to try my go to Oxtail chili Cheese fries. Then ordered the pork belly bao and the Mr. Ho burger add the fried egg. The menu is innovative and seasonal which can accommodate to many foodies out there.

The interior is updated with a bar that serves alcoholic beverages, signature drinks, and shakes. As well as an extension of shoku ramen which is also included into the bachi menu.

Service was accommodating and friendly. They were able to cater to our order promptly and was able to guide us to the process of ordering. Great job and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers spicy miso my favorite.   Always busy which says everything about the place if you have to wait it is well worth it"}
{"text":"Update 4/8/2014.
This business called Yelp HQ to try to get my review below removed! This all speaks to how shady this business is and them not wanting the truth to be seen by the pubic. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update on same visit 3 days later:
I just got my credit card bill today and this restaurant charged me and extra $5 without my approval for my takeout order! I'm contesting it through my credit card company which means this restaurant will pay a penalty in addition to the amount contested. They just shot themselves in the foot!!

I HATE dishonest restaurants that pulls these kinds of SCAM! They will FOREVER lose a customer and I will tell every single one of my friends to NEVER visit any of their locations!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Food is very tasty! Very popular so be prepared to wait awhile.

I'm really not into burgers but I do love Japanese food. Since foie gras is banned in California I have to get my fix in vegas! When I saw the shogun burger with foie gras on their menu, I had to go and try it. Everything on the menu is a la carte, so you have to order fries salads separately. I ended up doing takeout because I had to rush back to work. The restaurant is clean but packed on a weekday afternoon, parking was not easy.

The shogun burger was excellent, and well worth the $25. The Kalbi burger was good too, although the kimchi overpowered the Kalbi and I felt like I just got a mouthful of fermented spicy veggies. The pork belly buns I really enjoyed.

Would come back to try the fries next time."}
{"text":"Deeeeelicious.  It took about 10 minutes to put in our order on a Saturday afternoon. I felt kind of bad for looking for the waitress, but the host even noticed that our order wasn't taken yet. But still no waitress. I had to ask another employee to find out who is supposed to take our order. Another waitress, seemed a little pissed off, took out order. Turns out, it wasn't even supposed to be her. Hopefully no one spit in our food... 

anyway, the food was delicious like always. My yuzu aioli had a discolored layer on top, but luckily the french fries came with a fresh aioli cup, so I used that one. Besides that, I took some first-time bachi burger people with me and they loved the food. Loved it to the point of overeating bc it tasted soo good. 

I think I still prefer the one in Henderson better, but this branch is definitely larger. Will be returning... To the Henderson one most likely!"}
{"text":"Interesting flavors here, fresh tasting beef and a penchant for the visual flair, these guys can craft a gourmet style burger with the best of them. I'm more of a meat and burger guy, but throw a fried egg on that beef and viola! Something new. Yes, an egg on a burger is new for me. Service was good and the price was right."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is SOO GOOD. I ordered Kiki's burger without mushrooms and added egg. Uh...YUM! The truffle fries are also good too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was definitely using the force on this day. (May 4th) I found this place on the Triple D app on my Iphone. It happened to be close to the office I was visiting in Vegas on a business trip. Let's just say the food is everything Guy described on the show. 

Got there around 1:15pm on Monday and the place was packed. Its located in a strip mall sort of but appears to be the main attraction. I waited only 5 minutes before being seated. Let me stress that the place remained full the entire time I was there. If someone got up, someone was sat. The waitstaff is super cool and laid-back but efficient in serving these morsels of goodness. I always judge a place on capacity and fullness, this place is off the chart. 

I can't speak for anything but what I ordered. That being said, its the only thing I would get again not to diminish my view of the establishment. I had the Miyagi-sun burger and salt/pepper fries. First, the burger has all the highlights of sports center on a Sunday night during football season. It comes with Chili Mayo  Fried Egg  Furikake Caramelized Bacon  Crispy Onion Rings - its like a symphony in your mouth. The beef is like butter with texture in your mouth and it has a crust from the flat top grill that adds that hint of char. The hot crispy fries come with: Maui Onion Sea Salt  Garlic Chili Aioli and sliced Jalepeno peppers. Its the bomb dot com...Drop the Mike!"}
{"text":"The best place for burgers ever!!! Here x 2 because of rave review from diners, drive-ins n dives via Guy Fierri. The pork belly and duck sliders, banh mi burger and kalbi burger.......delish!!!!! Every time I'm in Vegas...will stop by....it's a must do place to get the best in satisfying your burger craving...!!!"}
{"text":"This place had the yummiest milkshakes ! I had the Kiki burger & it was really good & huge! Our server was great too."}
{"text":"This fell into the haze of my Vegas trips so not a standout 5 star experience for me. I hadn't seen the DDD appearance and came in with no expectations. The joint is in a kind of unattractive, strip mall location; although the interior decor is nice and does not feel like a strip mall. We ordered 3 burgers, 2 fries, and a salad and all shared. It was 4 girls; nothing surprising about that!

The fries are a can't miss if you're there and after seeing the DDD episode I have great life regret over not order the name sake dish of the restaurant - bachi is Vietnamese for pork belly."}
{"text":"OMG!!! When is the LA/Sawtelle location going to open!?!?!?!?! I can't just conveniently drive to Las Vegas whenever I'm craving The Miyagi every week. 
You guys are my top 3 for burgers. 

For Asian foodies or foodies that like Asian food and/or burgers, then Bachi is a must try!! The hype doesn't die down here. Everything is good, every burger is a different flavor profile, and you can even create your own burger!

The Miyagi is my favorite. I love fried egg anything, furikake has amazing sweet & salty flavors, and the crunchy texture from the onion rings makes it a winner every single time! Plus the wagyu beef patty. ooooooooooomahgaaaaaaaawd!!!! drooling & FEIGNING FOR IT RIGHT NOW! Paired with truffle fries, or ox tail fries, or plain fries...perfectly crispy every time. I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! I loved the concept of an Asian fusion and everything I ate was delicious! A little upset I came in while somewhat hungover, thanks to open bar at Senor Frogs. I didn't finish my food cause my stomach was still a little upset. BUT, it was BOMB!

Husband and I shared the fried chicken wings. I'm telling you, you'd be a fool not to order them. Best wings I've ever had!! We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries. Again.. The best ever!!

I ordered the Miyagi-San burger with grilled onions instead of onion rings. The meat was flavored SO WELL and I loved the over easy fried egg.

My husband ordered the Kiki burger and I swear I looked down at my food, then up at his and it was gone. That good!!!"}
{"text":"What a great burger! Tried the Shogun w two big pieces of foie and wagyu beef and imagine w a poached Asian pear and miso butter. It was decadent and full of fattiness and flavor. It's definitely not a light meal. Paired this with a strawberry guava shake which was nice and thick and perfect with the burger. Also shared the oxtail chili fries which were spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other day, really wish I had explored other options.  Food was ok, burger was certainly nothing special, fries ok.  My main \"beef\", I found this place trying to be pretentious and very overpriced.  They succeeded at both.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place after first moving here, and will continue to bring my family every time they come into town. 

These Burgers are so juicy and the flavors are all so different and well put together. If you want a unique experience of Asian-fusion burgers this is the place to go! My favorites are the black and green burger and the one with curry (I don't remember the name)

Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great gourmet burger when you're looking for one

1. Truffle Parmesan Fries are awesome!
 
2. Crispy Fried Onion Rings were good because they are lightly battered but I found them to be a little soggy for my liking.
 
What I ordered: main course 

3. CUSTOM MADE BBQ BURGER
BBQ Bachi Burger 7oz Angus Beef- Fried Egg, Grilled Onions, Cheddar (3 slices), Ketchup, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion.

The burger was amazing!!! I would come here again and again! 
4 stars because of the oily/soggy Onion Rings but if I have to rate just the Burger it would get a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. Just Amazing.

We ate here with a group of friends, one of whom happens to be that horrible person who is rude to wait staff. Not only did we get spectacular service (I cannot believe I forgot her name! Young asian girl wearing glasses), they also tolerated our obnoxious table mate. Our waitress busted her ass. I was very impressed.

The Burgers here are very original. There was a whole lot of \"What the hell is that?\" \"I don't know but it's spectacular.\" I had the Ronin burger, it was heavenly. I brought my wife back a Veggie burger. She raved (and she hates everything about meat). 

Extra Credit: The Beer list is superb. Minor subtraction of points by referring to their Rogues by their more obscure Japanese names to make them sound extra exotic, but a minor gripe.

Only Negative: Not open Mondays."}
{"text":"The drinks were really good and the shake/smoothie but the food was Okay. The ox tail taste just like normal fries. It is  spicy, barely any meat, and just topped on  reg. Fries. I thought it would live up to the hype but it disappointed me. The waiter was also rude when we called In, he claimed to be busy but when we got there, there were less than 10 customers. I don't think the food is all that."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place the title: \"Best Burger Joint in the West\".. comparing this to California burgers like Umami, Father's Office, and Back Abbey
I've been here several times now and have yet to lose the awe from eating their delicious burgers and fries.

Each burger has their own distinctive flavor but the best, most amazing burger i've ever eaten is their KIKI BURGER(add a fried egg). I remember the first time biting into the burger at the other Bachi location.. I had one of those euphoric moments of satisfaction where all I was thinking was, \"WOW\"! The ingredients compliment each other perfectly, with the shitake mushrooms, caramalized bacon and the garlic chili aioli supporting the perfectly cooked patty.. amazing!

Other burgers I've tried:
Ronin- the sauce in this one is great.
Banh-Mi- a detailed mixture of Vietnamese flavors put on a burger. Looks simple but has a burst of flavor.
Shogun($26)- so many flavors I've never tasted before generated in this one burger. Pretty amazing with the Wagyu Beef and Unagi. 

For your first time, I suggest ordering the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with your burger. It is truly one-of-a-kind. Sweet and meaty.. no need to dip in any sauce. If it seems too much, the Truffle Parmesan Fries is a tasty alternative.

It seems like Bachi's business and popularity is starting to blossom. Aside from the amazing food, it's a pretty modern and hip restaurant with cool employees. This is a perfect dinner date spot if you want to get away from the strip.
They really need to open up the LA location already!"}
{"text":"I guess I don't get it?

Everything was wholly average. Burgers, service, prices--average. I ordered Kiki's burger--average. Some bites were overly sweet, but the mushrooms added a good savory touch. I had the garlic fries--average. They trick you into thinking you're getting an f-ton of fries and you're getting about a handful.

Also, their hostesses kept seating people directly next to us, too, which was kind of irritating considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Twice the other diners asked to be moved so they weren't joining us for our meal.

I'd have to be dragged back---to me, it's not worth a revisit."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the very best burger in Las Vegas. Driven past here many times and finally stopped in, so glad we did, we have definitely found our go to burger restaurant, if I could give Bachi more than 5 stars I would.   Thank you for an amazing dinner and thank you to Zack for such fantastic service."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  My parents also love this place!  Every time they visit Vegas, we have to go here to eat to fix their cravings!  

So here's a little scoop on Bachi burger....the owners are from Hawaii so they know what flavor is all about!  Their burgers are not your ordinary burgers you find at some plain old American place....no, they add some Asian essence into each of their food items!  From the Miyagi burger topped with a fried egg and furikake to a kimchee kalbi burger that is to die for!  

Not only are the burgers BOMB, but their appetizers satisfies each and every one of those taste buds on your tongue.  A few of my favorites include the oxtail fries (which is a MUST order), the arabiki and kurabuta sausages, and even the duck skin and pork belly buns!  

I was born and raised in Hawaii, and us Hawaii peeps know that food in Hawaii is the best!  Living on the mainland sure makes you crave things you can only get back on the islands. Bachi burger is the perfect place to fix some of those cravings!   

I cannot wait to go back and try a new burger!"}
{"text":"Here for the burger and truffle fries.  A must when in Vegas. Asian fusion great casual gourmet burger"}
{"text":"Today my husband decided to try Bachi burger and he said the burger was delicious . He had the Miyagi burger with Parmesan truffle fries. The burger was full of flavor and super juicy. The fries were delicious ."}
{"text":"The burgers were sooooo perfect. My friends and I came here and tried the ox tail fries, truffle fries, pork buns, kiki burger, miso burger, ronan burger and black and green burger. Allll so delicious!! From those burgers the miso and ronan was the best!! Also had the salt and Carmel milk shake. Service was quick and efficient
 Definitely coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Hey there fella, you want a burger and some sides? Nah. We're out of half the items you ordered and are out of some others you didn't. But, you can rest assured the service will be sub par and ambivalent.

That's pretty much how I feel my experience went. It's a shame because there's potential here. When I asked about the large number of items that they were out of, I was told the owner just hasn't ordered stuff, and they're out of a lot of beers too and that it's because a lot of people are always coming in.

Eh, I'll probably help them out by not coming in, that way they won't run out so quick."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite burger place in Vegas. I have tried other places but have yet to find one that compares in flavor and customer service. The Ronin burger is very good, but my favorite is probably the one with onion rings and caramelized bacon on it...you can't really go wrong with these! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars; I got the bachi fish and they improved their ratio of fish to greens from the last time I went, but the fish is a little too sweet for my liking. It's still really good though! The salt and pepper garlic fries are the best too! 

Service: 1 star; the service on a Saturday is pretty terrible. It seems like they don't have enough staff to accommodate the influx of people, but also, the workers are just not attentive, nor friendly. Of the 3 workers we dealt with, not one of them seemed happy or friendly. Maybe it was just an off day for them... We tried flagging someone down for about 8 mins and not a single worker was looking around at the customers or paying any attention to them. They were all standing with their backs to the customers which seems like a big \"no-no\" to me in the serving world, but perhaps that's just me...One person even walked by and ignored us when we tried grabbing their attention. It wasn't until I got up myself and talked to someone that we finally were able to get a server to come over to us.  

Overall, I like this establishment, but I feel like they just need to step up their game in customer service. Even a little bit would go a long way."}
{"text":"I anxiously awaited my visit to Las Vegas, just so I could try Bachi Burger.  I had heard so much about it, and it was all good!   First of all, the location-  off the strip at the South end of town.  It was conveniently located just four short blocks away from our RV resort, which was quite welcome after already having driven about 5 1/2 hours to get to Vegas.  

The restaurant :  Kinda hard to find the entrance, but once we did, we were seated without a wait.  We arrived at about 5:45 on a Thursday.  I was surprised at how small this place was.  It looks like it only seated about 50 people.  The environment was very industrial chic.

The food: ORGASMIC, MINDBLOWING, AMAZING!  O.K.  I think you get the picture.  I loved the food.  We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries.  These super crisp fries are topped with a fair amount of the delicious chili, cheese sauce, and a perfect sunny side up egg.   My son built his own burger with an angus patty, cheese, bacon, and crispy onion rings.  My husband and I shared the Miagi-son burger.  It had an angus beef patty, furikake seasoning, carmelized bacon, fried egg, and chili aoli.  It was great!

I of course enjoyed their house Chardonnay, and my husband enjoyed his icy cold (however a bit pricy) craft brew."}
{"text":"This review is late times two... it is a combo review about both of our experiences to the same Bachi Burger location!

During our first visit, my husband and I stopped in for lunch on an early Wednesday afternoon in October. The restaurant was fairly empty at this time, we were immediately seated and our hardest decision was deciding what delicious goodies to try first! 

We opted on sharing the Pork Belly Steam Buns, the Kiki Burger and an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries. HOLY heck, amazing! I consider burgers and fries one of my true life weaknesses and these had me needing a new set of panties they were so good. As if all of that wasn't enough, we even opted to try their homemade Portuguese Donuts for dessert. Also scrumptious and well worth the splurge! Not only could we not wait to return, we wanted to bring friends and family!

Our second visit was a Sunday evening in late December, right before Christmas, this time with my sister and brother in law. Prior to our visit I tried to call ahead and make reservations. They don't offer that but the woman who answered stated they shouldn't be too busy on a Sunday evening around 8pm. You could imagine my surprise when we were told there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table. After reading numerous Yelp reviews talking about a long wait time, I can not fathom the reason for her saying that.

We did wind up being seated a bit earlier than expected (around 20-25 minutes) and were anxious to order. My husband and I wanted to start with the Shrimp Chips. Those were brought promptly along with our drinks, although my sister's beer took a moment. The Shrimp Chips were yummy and like pork rinds. Truly a unique treat.

My husband and brother in law both chose the Shogun burgers while I chose the Ronin burger and my sister chose the Kiki burger. Each couple also ordered Parmesan Truffle Fries to share.

Our server was kind and attentive but after waiting for our burgers and fries for over 40 minutes, I felt horrible that he had to be the one to keep coming over and apologizing for the wait. It certainly wasn't his fault and although we were very hungry, we of course were not angry with him. At some point, the manager should have been the one to do this and I feel he should have perhaps hooked us up with some extra fries on the house for the long delay. Neither happened.

Everyone agreed the food was again delicious and outstanding! It was my first experience ever tasting fois gras (via my husband's burger) and it was divine! I would absolutely return (and plan to) but a few suggestions for Bachi Burger....

- start taking reservations, especially for dinner and on weekends
- learn to deal with heavy crowds a bit better, maybe via extra staff?
- make those mangers do the dirty work

Those factors are the only reason both experiences combined equal four stars instead of a full five. If you want fine dining food available at average restaurant prices and a relaxed atmosphere, Bachi Burger is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Went to this place when I was in Vegas with my girlfriends for a dinner. It was a little far from the strip, but we managed to get there. We waited about 20 minutes, but I assume that was fast for a Saturday night. We ordered the oxtail fries, Kiki's burger, and the Pork Belly Bao. My favorite were the oxtail fries, so tender and delicious and such an interesting take on the old chili cheese fries. The burgers were okay for me; they were interesting combinations, but I am just not a burger person. It's pretty spacious and the food is good."}
{"text":"Still my favorite burger joint.

I've been coming here since it's opened. I recommend this to visitors and folks who ask for my recommendations in Vegas.

Great apps, great drinks, great burgers. Affordable for what you get and a good casual restaurant.

I'm glad they have made a name for themselves and even opened up multiple locations. This location could get busy during peak times, so make sure you allocate time to wait around. Might as well grab a drink while you wait."}
{"text":"Its been a long time coming back because of service. I had family in town that wanted to try it out. Our server was great and she was patient as we had alot of questions. She also helped out with making sure that my sisters food was gluten free. The food was amazing!! I dont remembering it being that good before. Will be back."}
{"text":"1st time eating here and I must say the food choices are pretty awesome! I was there for lunch so it wasn't crazy crowded but I can see it being crowded at night! NOTE: they are big burgers definitely can share it with someone or if your HANGRY knock yourself out and eat the whole damn thing!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!

What a great new addition to the south side of town.  Us locals are really rolling out the red carpet to our new neighbor, Bachi Burger.  With a large comfy couch nestled off to the side, walls displaying pieces by local artists and Jack Johnson and Dave Matthews streaming out of the sound system, it's just like being hanging out with friends at home but with delish eats that I would never be able to pull off.  There are burgers of all types that sound so good you are thinking about what you want to try on your next visit before you've even ordered.  The pickle plate is a crispy, tangy beauty with fun items like lemongrass and ginger.  The ronin burger was a garlic lover's dream and even had a perfectly cooked egg on top.  The crab cake burger was soft and perfectly seasoned.  Try it with their yuzu aioli for added zest.  The garlic & pepper, sweet potato and parmesan truffle fries were all wonderful but the dipping sauces were all beyond compare.  After polishing every delicious bite you probably won't have any room for dessert so take a bag of their homemade toffee home to enjoy for the rest of the week.  The only complaint is that so many others already share my love of Bachi Burger and had beat me to the punch on this Sunday evening, leaving the restaurant sold out of edamame, the grilled marinated cod burger and the cherry  pop tart dessert.  No worries, as they are all waiting patiently at the top of my \"to do\" list for next weekend's Bachi Burger outing."}
{"text":"This past weekend, we dined at four different establishments and believe it or not, Bachi Kitchen shot up to the top of our list for a good dining experience compared to the rest.

The service was slow and at times felt non-existent, but the Kikis Burger was delicious. We also ordered sweet potato fries, which came with a generous portion and for my sweet tooth - I got the chocolate hazelnut malt! It was definitely worth every calorie intake! 

The check was $24 and I left Vegas a happy camper!"}
{"text":"I come here just for the Caesar salad :)... Umami!!! Grilled sausages, house pickles, calamari w/Thai basil won't hurt."}
{"text":"First... The food was amazing! I saw it on diners drive-ins and dives and had to go while I was in Vegas. I brought five coworkers with me. We all agreed that the food was unique and excellent. However... The service was poor. We had to ask for plates, we had to ask for napkins, they were sold out of almost all of their draft beers. And we felt like an inconvenience to our waitress.
Great food. Bad service."}
{"text":"Restaurant shut down due to severe health code violations and the people that work at this restaurant act like rabid dogs. Stay far away!

Before our flight back home, we had some time to grab lunch, so we looked up their website, and it stated that this location is open, and it opens at 11.  When we get to the restaurant, it was closed because they are cleaning for \"annual maintenance.\"  We were upset that we took an Uber from the strip, relying on info on their website. We didn't have time to go to another restaurant since our flight was at 1:30, so we told the hostess that. The hostess was extremely dismissive, never apologized and walked away. That upset us even more and we voiced our discontent at how she handed this situation. The rest of the restaurant staff responded to us by doing the following:

1) Telling is \"get the fuck out and never come back to Bachi Burger\"
2) surrounding my friend and I. (Btw I'm five feet tall). There was 7-8 staff members that surrounded me and a friend.
3) pushing my friend-yes, a busboy actually placed his hand on my friend. 
4) videotaping us and flipping us off.
5) Lying to us about the reason why they closed-they are cleaning bc the health dep't shut it down immediately following an inspection held on November 16. Its not due to \"annual maintenance\" 
There was no manager to mitigate the situation."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING. We had the ox tail fries, which where very delicious!!! We also had the pork belly mini burgers. Please forgive me I forgot the exact name of the dish. But it was delicious as well!! So many flavors and the bread!!! To die for! Was definitely a nice experience and a great meal."}
{"text":"went to bachi for first time about 330 on a tues afternoon. atmosphere was cool, music was world music which was cool. service was good, maybe a tad slow but they did get fairly busy and only had two girls waiting and bussing.Busser was cleaning windows when he should have been helping. I had garlic fries that had jalopenos on them. not the best. the truffle fries were very good. Had a build up burger, wagyu, blue cheese, onion rings and bacon. rings were sad, bacon was hard, both came out in pieces. to much cheese, over bearing. burger was kind of mince consistency, way to much sweet flaver and inconsisitant thru the paddy. Needs more salt and or spice, white pepper or something for my tastes. Price was very good on fries, $4. burger started at $16 and ended at $18.50. too much. burger size was good. bun was good. 
dont think I'll be back. strip burger does it better for less. Grind is a close second. Bachi is just another over priced fad. sorry. wanted so much more."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch about a week ago...order the Kiki burger, I believe. Also had part of my girlfriend's burger; she ordered the one with curry.

The food was okay. In my opinion, it was nothing to write home about. It was good, but it wasn't...noteworthy. I've had better specialty/boutique (whatever you want to call it) burgers at the same price, and cheaper.

There was a pretty long line when we got there, which to me should denote an amazing experience. When we were eventually seated, the restaurant wasn't seated to capacity, but was fairly busy.

After ordering our food, we waited a minimum of 30 minutes to get the food. I lost track of time...it felt like an eternity. We had also ordered an appetizer which arrived at the same time as our burgers did (which to me was not okay). We asked our server about 20 minutes into waiting where our food was and he said it was coming right up. 

The food here is 3-4 star quality, but the service was 2 star. 

Would I recommend this place to others? Maybe. 
Would I come back here myself? Maybe."}
{"text":"I've tried 3 of the burgers and would rate it as:
1. Mr. Ho's
2. Spicy miso
3. Kiki's burger

Kikis burger is actually very meeh, I'm not sure what the rave is all about as there is nothing original about it. If I had just that I would give this place three stars. Mr. Ho's is on the opposite end where I dream about it whenever I'm craving a burger. Service is a little slow so expect to spend some time here."}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite burger place ever. I fell in love with this place the first time I've been to Vegas and I fell in love with their chicken/turkey burger. At that time, I couldn't eat beef so I had to opt for either chicken or turkey and they're usually so dry and bland but the moment I bit into this chicken burger it was like my soul left my body. 

Now that I can eat beef, I came back to try their beef burgers and it was just as amazing. I got the Miyagi burger and it was just a burst of heaven in my mouth. 

I usually only like to try restaurants in a different city once to give more places a chance but this is one of the few restaurants that I would definitely come back to again and again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every trip I make to Las Vegas usually includes one dining experience away from The Strip, which is easy because I always rent a car for golf purposes. Bachi Burger was my choice on this trip and it was a winner. While this original location is rather small, it is still very comfortable, clean and recently underwent a modest renovation. I won't say it is unlike any other burger destination, but I will say that the burgers themselves are very unique. Good flavor in every bite and really appreciated how the servers asked about food allergies when ordering because of the nature of the menu options. They also have full-liquor and many other drink and food options if your taste takes you beyond simply a burger and a beer. When playing golf in the area on a future trip, this will definitely be my 19th hole."}
{"text":"love the banh-mi burger! It was definitively my favorite.

My fiancée and I went here, he loves the typical (plain) American burger and in love a mouthful of flavors. So this is the perfect spot to compromise! 

Some may wonder why the burger only comes as itself and not with fries or something on the side, it's because they are HUGE! I can barely finish one, less than with their fries. Their fries are HUGE, definitively something you should share. I love fries, so they had a few flavors to choose from. I usually try the garlic fries or gravy fries. With any actually can't do wrong.

Ambience is nice, wait time can be hot or miss. Either we get seated right-away or we have a log wait ahead of us. No reservations below 10 people, the few times I had called ahead. 

Price is mid range, Definitively worth for these 'fusion' mixes of burgers."}
{"text":"Service here can be hit or miss, but the food is always delicious. I will say that the burgers should come with a choice of fries for the price. The fries should also come out with the rest of the hot food. Last time I went, they were out of my choice of dessert, so I opted for the fried donuts w/ a side of guava sauce. Winner! Ultimately, I realllly want to like this spot since it's so close to my crib & the burgers are actually great, but there are just a few too many hiccups every time I visit. Firm 3 stars for Bachi."}
{"text":"JUST FANTASTIC.

I came here with my girls Kelsey W. and Katie H. at the end of our Vegas trip on the way back home to Cali. Katie H. saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and was meaning on coming here for a while. Glad we went to Vegas together so we could try this fine establishment together.

We took a seat at the bar which was great cus we got to talk a little with our waiter (tall red-head with a pony-tail) while he mixed drinks and such. Super nice guy with great food descriptions cus he made me want to try the entire menu, and I don't even eat pork or shell fish!!

We started with the black truffle parmesan fries. I mean, everything with truffle has to be good, right? But these were exceptional! Seasoned with just the right amount of spices, chives, parmesan flakes, truffle oil, and (surprise!) gravy! Suuuuuper good! Oh and with a sundried tomato aoli dip. Mmm mm mmmm!

Ok burgers. I got the Miyagi-San burger. I was nearly crying (and definitely licking my fingers...hell my whole hand) from the pure insanely good quality and tastes in my mouth. Beef medium, thinly fried onion rings, and an over-easy (not drippy!) egg. Buns were toasted, soft, sweet and yet so perfectly matched with the burger contents. Amazing, I was actually really sad when I finished eating.

They need to bring this place to LA, they will make millions! Until then, I look forward to coming back during my next trip to Vegas and trying more from the menu, even their cool cocktail and beer options. 

One of the best quality burgers I've ever had. Well done Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"I placed an order for takeout and instead of receiving the salt and pepper fries I ordered I received just fries. I had to drive back to work so it wasn't possible for me to comeback and correct the order. The manager on duty, Dylan, assured me that next time my fries order would be comped and that he would be working the same hours the next night. He takes my name and number down on a memo.

I place a takeout order the next night but am told that Dylan isn't in. A lady named Savannah tells me that there's no memo and that Dylan needs to be there to confirm what happened just last night. Not only is this frustrating and embarrassing for me, but this shows the lack of communication and organization amongst management. This was greatly upsetting not just because it made me look foolish but what was promised to me was not delivered."}
{"text":"I have to say the burgers are really good I have tried this place a few times. This time I dined in and I have to say the service really sucks, service is slow, waiter disappeared, no refills on the water granted they were packed but still there should be a set standard. 

I would only do take out from here.
4 stars food
1 star service"}
{"text":"Well, my experience wasn't as great as others here. 

We visited on a Sunday night around 7p.  Our server seemed to be pretty forgetful.

We ordered a slice Wagyu burger and she ordered us a regular burger.  The sliced burger, once it was re-delivered, was nice.  However, the Ronin burger was just so-so.  The parmesan fries were fine and the chopped salad was small.  The drinks were large sized though.  

I will give this place another try.  Hopefully, our server will be less absent minded and the food a bit better."}
{"text":"Skip all other burger joints!  This place is just insane! 

The price is right 
The food is fresh
The service is great 

We went here at 430 on a Saturday Afternoon and the place was packed, but we got seated at the bar right away.  Not the most ideal place to sit,but we got the bartenders feedback on the menu which really helped because the menu has so many different things.  We ended up ordering the Miyagsi San's Burger with Just Fries and Pineapple Ketchup. This burger should win Burger of The Year! 

This place is off the beating path, but well worth the ride."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service was a little lacking. Seemed like the main waitress was fighting with the other girls. Maybe she was just having a bad day? The food is unique, but delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Great service and the staff was super friendly. The girl waiting on us explained the whole menu and gave great recommendations. The food was amazing. I was hesitant at first because of the Asian influence on the burger. Once I tasted it I knew I would be back. It was a unique taste that I never had with a burger. I recommend the Miyagi San burger with Parmesan truffle fries."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great atmosphere and friendly attentive staff. Would definitely come back. The sweet potato fries are hands down the best I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I recently ordered the Spicy Miso burger with a no meat patty ... HOLY MOLY. If you want a delicious veggie burger definitely try it! I also love all the gals that help me every-time I order take out or dine in. They are all very friendly and helpful, if they don't know the answer they will find out. Mindy the manager is amazing! So helpful, friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because the food was good but the service was horrible and $9 for a burger without regular fries is over-price to me.  We came for a late lunch on Sunday and the wait was 40 minutes even though they told us 25 minutes and then everything was slow there from taking our orders to getting the check. We ended up spending almost 2 hours there for a burger lunch; however, we had 2 different types of specialty burgers and they were both good."}
{"text":"Ugh. What a horrible experience. Maybe the other location in LV is better. Came here purposely because there's supposed to be some incredible vegan burger? I don't know. 
Me and two other people sit down. Smells weird. I ask about the veggie burger and to make sure it's vegan. He says yeah but has to make some modifications to sauces and stuff. Cool. We get drinks and some water, begin to settle in when we're placing our orders and he tells me that actually the bun isn't vegan and something else. It was VERY nice that he went to check, don't get me wrong but it was just a bit frustrating that now we have this cocktail to pay for, have already opened silverware and stuff and now we have to walk out bc there is literally nothing I can eat there. I'm not sure why in Yelp (or I think on the menu) it said there are vegan options because there aren't. IT was all around awkward and a bummer bc we made a special trip."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm not a huge hamburger fan, but I appreciate a good burger every once in awhile. My first go around here I tried the garlic & chili edamame,  which I now get every visit, and for awhile I kept getting the lonely bird, which is a really good alternative to red meat if you are trying to stay a little health conscious. So I strayed from the bird and got the Kiki burger, wow it's so tasty, the different flavors in combination together give this burger 5 stars. I love french fries so I have to try all the different options, I have to say the sweet potato fries are my favorite and I like to dip them in the pineapple ketchup. I love boba tea so I usually get the milk tea or the taro boba for dessert. 

Only downer about this place is we usually have to wait for a table, they should add some more tables, service has always been good."}
{"text":"Decent, but overrated for what it was. Service was great, but food was fair. Had better truffle fries elsewhere. My burger just didn't have the \"bang\" that I've seen in some of the photographs. Could have been an off day."}
{"text":"I'm told this is good eats, so we went last night st around 6:00PM (11/17/17). Place had a hand-printed sign that said \"closed\", no other explanation. I just now called the Sahara location and employee there said the Windmill location is \"temporarily closed\". She wouldn't say why or when they will reopen. If this is a Health Dept issue, I'd like to know and SHOULD know!

UPDATE 12/3/2017: this location has been closed down by the Health Department (per Channel 13) for a cockroach issue."}
{"text":"Tan tan men is delicious.  Took a while to get seats, but the soupy noodles was delicious.  The soup was creamy-sweet-savory, the noodles were soft, and the overall flavor has a refreshing cilantro tone with crispy veggies and savory meats"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to eat that was not on the Strip and found this place with 4 stars and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Not being very hungry, we ordered the Pork belly steam bun, kiki's burger, and ronin burger.

We went for the pork belly instead of the duck for steamed bun because it is all about the fat. They grilled the pork belly to perfection. The fluffiness and chewiness of the steamed bun combined with the crusty, melt-in-you-mouth goodness, the buns were gone in a minute.

I was sold when I read that there is shiitake mushroom and other mushrooms in the Kiki's burger along with caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. For me to finish a burger when I am not very hungry, you know how delicious this burger is.

My companion ordered the ronin burger with the wagyu patty and fried egg. It looked impressive, but tasted alright in comparison to my kiki's. 

Great place if you have a car when you visit Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed. Did I mention my Kiki's burger was only $11? Tell that to someone in California or New York, they'd be pissed!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all. Got take-out. Ordered simple partially because website menu was down, and I didn't have a menu at work, also so I can measure up to other places. I had a simple cheeseburger(cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion) and the wifey got a grilled cheese and an order of the parmasean fries. Like I said simple. Burger was good. Nothing special. Wife was disappointed. The picture of grilled cheese on this site looks nothing like what she got. The picture looks like a panini pressed grilled sandwich on a white type bread. She got a hamburger bun with some melted cheese on it. She said it didn't taste too bad, but wasn't what was expected. Fries were good. My burger was ok. Not the best I've had, but not the worst I've had. I will try this place again, and order something a little more exotic next time. Will update review then."}
{"text":"Excellent food; however, the service was bar none the worst service we have ever encountered in las Vegas. The whole place was ran by women. So, the entire time we were there they were try I to hurry us along and push us out the door even though there was hardly anyone in there. It seems like they just want you to come in to take your money then leave, that's all they cared about. Unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"i'm so glad i'm going back to LV in 2 weeks cuz i can't wait to come back here to try some more burgers!  i didn't know a burger could be so good.  the patties were seasoned well, cooked perfectly.  the bread was soft and didn't dominate, the toppings were all so unique.  and they all blend perfectly.

we ordered
:oxtail chili cheese fries - awesome, though wish it had more meat/sauce
:pork belly steamed buns - i wanted to see how authentic these buns were.  the flavor was spot on, just like in Taiwan, but the surface was a tad dried out.  figures cuz they buy them from a bakery in chinatown daily.
:manga burger - that day's special.  awesome combination of stuff and there was a lot
:kiki's burger - husb said the sweet onion marmalade was a bit too sweet for him, but other than that was very good
:miyagi-san's wagyu burger - didn't taste it but it looked fantastic

oh, here's a tip: order the oxtail chili cheese fries as soon as you sit down.  that way something will come out sooner cuz chances are you'll be hungry from the wait and looking at all the fab food going to other tables."}
{"text":"I don't think there is a burger place in Las Vegas untouched by my husband and I. It's our mission to find the perfect burger. We were pretty stoked to finally make our way to Bachi Burger, a lot of people we know LOVE it. 

The restaurant is nice, almost too nice for a burger place. People are dressed in shorts and tank tops and there is low mood lighting and fancy serving plates. I never got comfortable there, can I slouch in my chair and relax, or do I sit up straight with my napkin in my lap? (About 10 minutes before we were about to leave, someone hit the switch and glaringly bright cafeteria like lights blasted on. Holy crap! Blinded!)  

We ordered burgers and fries. The burgers were good. Interestingly good. The garlic fries, not so much. It was an expensive cone of bits with no flavor. 

My husband and I both agree that it's a place you have to try but we're in no hurry to go back. Our burgers where good but didn't fill that \"I'm in the mood for a good burger\" craving. My taste buds where confused."}
{"text":"I'm usually weary when a friend suggests a fancy burger joint, especially since I derive most of my burger pleasure from the likes of a quick and affordable visit to In-N-Out. But, I like Bachi Burger for a couple of reasons: the location is off the Strip, making parking easy and the burgers are damn good and full of flavor. 

Bachi is one of the few fusion restaurants where the menu works on so many levels. Drink options include several Japanese import beers, boba milk teas, iced teas, and house sodas. I tried the cherry yuzu soda, which was quite refreshing. We started the meal with oxtail chili cheese fries. The portion was huge and meant to be shared. I loved the flavors of meat, cheese, garlic aioli, topped off with a perfectly runny fried egg. 

There were several options of specialty burgers to choose from. I went with the Ronin burger while my friend got the Kiki's burger. These burgers were all about flavor and texture. The angus beef was perfectly cooked, but everything worked so well together from the cole slaw to the miso goma dressing with the perfectly toasted buns. The yuzu citrus aioli was also a nice complement. Although I liked my burger better, the Kiki's burger is a great alternative, especially if you love mushrooms. Three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and a sweet onion marmalade takes this burger's flavor in a completely different direction. Bachi Burger is one of the few places in Vegas where I will endorse a $12-15 burger."}
{"text":"We called ahead to see if we needed to make reservations. We were told on the phone that they \"weren't that busy\" and reservations are not needed. We got there at about 7pm and almost every seat was taken. Apparently reservations WERE needed! But that isn't the main issue.

The main issue is that we stood there at the entrance for about 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. Then finally, someone came up and said we would have to wait for a table to open up. WELL DUH. Except there was a table open in the corner with seating for 4 that apparently nobody had any intent to fill.

We stood there another five minutes and the same girl came up and said, \"we are working on clearing a table for you.\" Another five minutes and still no table. We left.

I will try going here again because people rant and rave about the food, but the service was the worst. And now that I'm reading other reviews, I see a lot of people saying that. Dear owner: Please get the message!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great location next to movie theater. The food is awesome from salads to burgers. Fries and pineapple ketchup my fave. Servers always very upbeat and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the oxtail chili fries are sinfully delightful!!  Have been here a few times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is food gloriousness! I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing it on an episode of Diners Drive-ins and Dives. I had the Bahnmi Burger and can not say enough about how great it was. The bun was perfectly soft, the curry aoli gave it a great taste and that sauce, whatever it was, was amazing! I've also tried the Oxtail chili cheese fries and the Shogun Burger on subsequent visits. Both were okay but I would not order them again. I can't wait to come back to this place and try more of their menu. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"If you have the ability to make it off the strip and haven't injested enough beef products already to keep you steaming through the throngs of people - you NEED to make it to Bachi Burger!

The storefront is very unassuming and you actaully enter in the back from what I can tell.  The service staff is super attentive and very cordial and the decor is somewhat minimalistic with the exception of two flatscreen tvs - although each was playing either the Food Network or Cooking Channel - brilliant.

On to the food - by the name, burgers are the fare of choice - but Bachi has so much more to offer outside of the main entrees:

The pork belly steamed buns...YUM...melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness.  The pork is super tender and the rice-buns are sticky/gooey hold the roof of you mouth.  The hoisin BBQ dipping sauce is tangy and thick and a perfect compliment to the pork and the egg and the bun.

Sweet Potato fries - killer.  Probably the best I have had anywhere.  The Yuzu Citrus Aioli is a decent compliment.  (We found that the sauce that came with a burger was a better choice).

Burgers - Both we delicious and had the makings of an outstanding burger (depsite not being beef).  The Bachi fish is what drew me in - whew, what a burger!  The crab cake burger was outstanding.  Patty was thick and teaming with seafood and the sauce (ordered on the side) is what we used primarilly for dipping the sweet potato fries...even our server was surprised at that and said she would try it.

The homemade soda was a hit too - zinging with taste but a refreshing break from the typical coke/pepsi routine.

If we hadn't come for lunch, I may be inclined to try for an evening meal to try some of the sake.....just saying.

Go here!"}
{"text":"Do you know how to tell if a place is really good? If you leave and find yourself thinking, \"I really want to go there again.\" This wasn't te case with bachi burger. 


Kiki burger: pretty tasty, had a nice sauce that made the burger stand out. 

Truffle fries: they were okay, honestly I've tried better fries. Maybe I should have gone with the oxtail chili fries

The wait to sit was like 40 minutes, the wait for the food was about 20-25 I think. Don't come here super hungry. It would probably be better to have a snack first because you can get really grumpy after awhile.

Service: our waiter was pretty nice. They let us sit outside even though it seemed like the patio wasn't open. Other people were seated outside too after awhile.

The food was pretty good, but not spectacular. I think it's a place that people should try, but not somewhere I would visit often."}
{"text":"Oh my God they have one of the best burgers I've ever had I don't know how to do it how to cook it but it is fantastic. The burgers must have some kind of teriyaki sauce or marinade or dressing or something but it's fantastic. The portions were pretty good even as a little bit hungry after that. Their oxtail fries are amazing. The service could be a little bit faster but overall my experience was awesome really love this place the burgers are everything that everybody talks about."}
{"text":"Innovation should always be rewarded. 

And that certainly applies to Bachi Burger; a restaurant that combines inventive cuisine and the best ingredients available.

The \"classic hamburger\" may be the perfect food, but pretty well everyone from \"In & Out\" to \"Bradley Ogden\" does it essentially the same way.

But not Bachi Burger!

They are pushing the envelope. They are thinking outside the styrofoam box!

Here are but a few facts about BB:
Hamburger buns and chinese steamed buns are from a bakery in Chinatown. 
They grind their own meat.
They make in-house pinapple ketchup, yuzu citrus aioli, and garlic chili aioli.
They have Garlic and Pepper french fries, and Truffle-parmesan french fries.
You can choose a burger made from angus, wagyu, crab, chicken/turkey or beef/pork/shrimp. 
They make fresh boba tea drinks and milk shakes.
They have an amazing dessert line-up including Portuguese donuts with Vietnamese cinnamon.
They have wagyu short ribs on chinese steamed buns.
They have a grilled cheese panini with gruyere, fontina, camembert and mezzo secco.

Lordy, I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it....gotta go back to try some of the other wondeful creations. Next for me is Peking Duck on Steamed Buns with boiled egg, chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin sauce.

Need I say more?

Even thought the location on Windmill is less than ideal, it's very much worth the trip.

Look out Burger Bar....you've been outdone."}
{"text":"Great quality of food. You pay a little more than normal burger joints. Oxtail fries are the best!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I had the Shogun burger and rather enjoyed it...but it's hard to go wrong with foie gras.  The oxtail fries were really yummy.  We also got the salt & pepper fries and the truffle fries...but I think the oxtail fries were the best.  I'd love to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Worst veggie burger I ever had.  Management came over to see what was wrong and it was intimidating.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"good burger, dont know about $15 but good all in all. for price you can get much better value somewhere else"}
{"text":"Rolled into Vegas 6-28 for our monthly run to Sin City...after seeing Bachi Burger featured on \"Diners , Drive in's & Dives\" I had to give it a try. It was Literally 110 degrees when we went inside , so first off Thank YOU Bachi Burger for jacking up the AC to stop us from melting!! From researching the menu , we knew what we wanted right away. I had the Banh Mi Burger , and my wife had the Kiki's Burger..we wanted to get the Oxtail chili Fries but the order is HUGE so the waitress suggested we order the regular fries with a side order of the Oxtail Chili (only $2 and perfect) ..Being a big fan of Banh Mi the Banh mi Bachi burger was outstanding!!!...Beef , pork and shrimp made into a burger patty , pork pate , curry aioli , nuoc mam sauce and the pickled carrots , onions and Jalapeno slices...this burger had everything. All the different flavors yet not too complicated...DELICIOUS!!the bun was probably the best burger bun I have ever had. I have been bragging about this burger for the past 6 days...The Kiki's Burger was also amazing , with eryongi , enoki and shittake mushrooms , bacon , sweet onion marmalade gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli !! WOW!!! My wife would have been thrilled to have gone back there for dinner the same night. The oxtail chili was spicy , sweet and layered with gooey cheese (which is always a good thing) we dipped our fries in it and it didnt take long for us to polish that off. Great Asian flavors all around with a comforting atmosphere , excellent service and good prices. We have already decided to make this an every trip stop so we can try the whole menu.....Love it  , love it ,  love it!!  Hands down down the best \"non traditional\" burger we have ever had........."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in town! Kiki's burger is heavenly delicious!  I would give 6 stars if I could for service, food and ambience! 
Updating my review: Bachi's breakfast is fantastic! Just had French toast with coconut syrup, raspberry purée, caramel crusted bananas and it was just incredible! Also wake up scramble is to die for! ( hubby ordered it) I think it's turning into my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas! And just got 10% off coupon! Sweet!"}
{"text":"Come here! Farther from the strip but no wait! And OMG. Best place I ate all vegas weekend. I had the ronin burger medium rare. They have great quality, fresh meat. Beef is ground in house daily,  never frozen making it worth the expensive burger. I also tried the oxtail fries chili cheese fries. I felt there was more chili cheese than oxtail tho. Very good place to eat."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last week as we always hear such good things about it. Needless to say, I highly doubt I will ever be going back.  Both of our burgers were so overcooked they bordered on being hockey pucks. But the worst part was when my friend chomped down on something hard in the burger that we both jumped.  We really thought she had broken her tooth as it was that loud and hard.  The manager was almost in disbelief that it happened. He did comp her burger...although he didn't respond to the hockey pucks being over cooked. Needless to say we were put off food for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"So good and so fresh! I have been here twice and it never fails! This place has a twist on burgers, at least to me, and it is so delicious! They staff is on top of things! We went on a Saturday at 2Pm and the rush had just ended, so perfect timing! 
Oh, and the shakes are so good! So save room or get one to go!!"}
{"text":"we were rebels and did not order any burgers..

however! we did decide to order a couple dishes go share. if you're a fan of Loco moco or tried/had a Loco moco before, you absolutely must must must try theirs! I'm used to garlic rice but they do theirs with a creamy risotto topped with some light and crispy onion rings. the beef patty layer was topped with a sweet but super zesty bbq kind of sauce. definitely a melt in your mouth combination. are you drooling yet? 

we also ordered the pork belly steamed buns. it comes with a side of the similar sauce as they put on the Loco moco. the buns were so finger licking good that there's no other way I can put it into words - just get it. try it. eat it. love it. seriously. seriously!! 

between those two dishes, they were extremely filling. the food was absolutely great, our server was sweet but service was just a little behind. not sure if they were short staffed but between food delivery and closing out our check, there was a lot of awkward waiting time in between."}
{"text":"Great burgers and salads. Kalbi and Miso burgers were awesome. Water was filled very timely. Salt and pepper fries were licous. Strawberry shake was great. Service outstanding."}
{"text":"Came back because I effin' love their burgers. This time around I ventured off to try the Kiki burger: Angus beef patty, sautéed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese & garlic chili aioli. 

This burger wasn't as great as the Miyagi but it still was a contender. The patty came out to be juicy. The mushrooms added an additional umami flavoring. While the bacon and onion provided the sweetness component to the meal. The cheese allowed the burger to have a creamy texture. The mixed greens was the perfect touch to tone down the saltiness of the ingredients. Yet another fantastic dining experience from Bachi. Compliments to the chef! :D"}
{"text":"I'm not a frequenter to this place, as this is my second time eating Bachi. My first was several years ago at the Sahara location. This joint has scrumptious burgers. This time, I got the Kalbi burger. If you're a fan of spiciness and kimchi, it'll probably be your favorite! The ambience is casual with upbeat music shadowing in the background. I tried some of the tonkotsu shio out of my girlfriend's bowl which was good, but nothing too special. The service was good; neither overwhelming nor did I have to deal with a server abandoning me until check time. Lol

3.5 for the ramen
4.5 for the burger
4 for the service"}
{"text":"Burger way over cooked and only a drizzle of truffle sauce on my fries. Could tell the food is sometimes amazing, just didn't get it done for me tonight."}
{"text":"After being seated, we didn't get any drinks and our order wasn't taken for over 15 minutes. Many workers walked past us and didn't acknowledge us even though it's very obvious that we still had menus and no drinks. We understand restaurants at busy but to not get drinks for over 15 minutes is pretty ridiculous. 

Prior to arriving, we were calling for over an hour to ask to place a pick up order. The phone was constantly busy and when they finally answered, they put us on hold for 15 minutes and never picked the phone back up. After being put on hold we decided might as well just go and eat there after all this hassle .. sooooooooo as you can see, we were pretty upset already but I was craving the ramen and it was close by so we wanted to stay optimistic and hope the night got better. 

The food was bomb. And the guy who helped our server was amazing. An experience and lasting impression starts once you walk through the door, and in our case when we first called. We will be back cause we love the food, we just hope the service is a lot better next time!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming here and we originally came for the Japanese food next door.  However, I ended up settling for the Bachi Burger side of the business.  I ordered a 7oz burger well done and it was exceptionally delicious, which is why it got 3 star instead of two stars.  They missed two points for the following two reasons:

1) My iced tea literally took 15 minutes to receive and I had to remind the server twice!

2) Food came out sporadically instead of all together, when I was here with a party of four.  Also, the hostess will not seat anyone unless all of your party is here.  I find the serving of food separately to be very rude to the party you're with, because you can't enjoy it all once.

Food is great, but there are some key elements that be should be improved upon."}
{"text":"OMG Everything about this place is amazing foods beyond good staff friendly Must eat type of place!!"}
{"text":"Good food. all was pretty good, but garlic fries could have been better. mmmm Hot Bunz sound good right now LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a second time to bring my cousin who was visiting from NorCal. I've been telling her about this place for a long time so finally we got the chance to take her. Sorry to say her experience was of disappointment. We ordered their famous oxtail chili cheese fries. There was no sight of oxtail anywhere in the dish unless the meat just melted! The burgers were good but slightly oily and the one thing that REALLY annoyed me was how slow their service was. Granted it was lunch time but it wasn't super busy. We all thought the cooks went on break or something because everyone's food came out all at the same time. By that I meant all the other tables in the restaurant and not just our food! Our waiter, a young gentleman, was clearly already having a bad day but if you're working in customer service, he should know better not to let his emotions come through. I'd rather go to the strip for a Shake Shack burger any day!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I have to say I was absolutely amazed. The atmosphere was very chill. I ordered the green and black burger. It was to die for. The bread melted in my mouth and the best part was the meat was grade fed beef so it was so tender and juicy!!! I will never want to order another burger unless its here. I would recommend this place for a gourmet burger over any other restaurant so far!!!"}
{"text":"Almost got 5 stars but my bun was burnt, they didn't put the beer battered onions on my burger and I couldn't get a glass of water or another drink. 

Decor: modern. The seating is made of light wood. The floor is painted concrete. Middle strip of the ceiling has flowers panted on the rest of the ceiling is open industrial ducts. We saw two paintings/artwork on the walls. I only really noticed them because I read on here that they have local art on the walls for sale. Unless you were told about them you wouldn't know to look. 

Service: room for improvement. When seated the hostess placed down the drink menu and and two menus for each of us. One was the lunch/dinner menu and the other was breakfast. The breakfast menu said available until 11am. It was 12:30pm so we couldn't understand why she still passed those out. Talk about a teaser. We had two different servers come up and ask our drink order blonde white lady and brunette Asian guy. Seems like they work each other's tables or they are confused since both said they would be our server. They never came up for beverage refills. And I really was thirsty. My friend ordered water with lemon and I ordered Thai tea which I wanted another one of or at least a glass of water. 

Food: Thai tea too much milk not enough tea. I never thought I would ever have a bad Thai iced tea but this one wasn't made right. Not a biggie but still it was a hot day and I was thirsty. The oxtail chilly cheese fries spicy yummy goodness! Get these fries!!! Pricey I think they were $13. There is a sunny side up egg on top. Fresh jalapeños mixed in the chilly topped with with some cilantro. The burgers DO NOT COME WITH ANY SIDES so I got just fries that came with a side of pineapple ketchup. This ketchup was amazing!!!! And I am not a fan of ketchup. But it was so sweet and thick because of the crushed pineapple. It gave ketchup a tropical feel. I loved it. The pork belly buns are delicious! You don't expect them to be like little slider sandwiches with a slaw inside and teriyaki sauce on the side. There are only three of them so get something on the side of you are a big eater. I ordered the lonely bird without tomatoes. Now the lonely bird is under sandwiches not burgers but it is a burger. It's ground chicken and turkey molded into a burger patty topped with brown ale batter onion rings, tomato, mixed greens in a grilled bro he bun with pesto sauce on the side. The onion rings on it made me decide on it and guess what was not on it.... The onion rings!!! I was so happy when I saw the bun. I cut it in half and took a bite and noticed the bun was a bit crispy but the party was soon flavorful and good. Halfway through I notice the rest of the bun was burnt and remembered they didn't put the onion rings on it!!! 

By that time I had finished my tea my friend was out of water. She came with the check and went to take our chilly fries away. I said I wanted to take them home. So she left the plate asked if we wanted dessert. We really were thirsty but no use sitting there downing water so we left and hit up a gas station for our water fix."}
{"text":"I go  for a unique burger n fries and delicious! 
Service is great and small location,  but food is great n delicious"}
{"text":"Food was good. I don't like burgers but these are kind of like a upgraded fun version of the burger. Host was kind of irritated when we didn't want to sit where she wanted us to sit and told her we would like to be by the window but she was the only Debbie Downer. All the other employees were really nice.  My party ordered all buns pork, duck, short ribs everything tasted fresh.  I would go back, want to get the garlic fries and the ox tail with egg fries next time."}
{"text":"Second time coming here with a gap of a couple of years between visits. I was hoping that things were better this time around since the restaurant is still hyped by many.

Worst part of the experience.
Ramen was salty and instead of making new broth, they just added what tasted like coconut milk to the existing broth.

Burgers were just average 

Ox tail fries were the best thing we had but aren't good enough to make me want to go back considering the other options available in Vegas.

Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me.
There won't be a third time"}
{"text":"This was our first stop here in Vegas for the weekend. We were all pretty hungry from the drive to there and my friends and I had never had this place before but had heard good reviews about it. 

Unfortunately for me, my stomach was kind of upset from the car ride. It might have been motion sickness but who knows. All I knew was that I didn't want to get a full burger or ramen with my stomach like this, so I ended up getting just the Parmesan jalapeño fries. Two of my friends got burgers, another one, ramen, and the other got an order of carne fries I think. The fries were good for sure, sweet snd spicy and the sauce was delicious. My friends told me their burgers were really good and the ramen was just kinda eh. I really liked their fries, but I really hope that the next time I come I get a burger."}
{"text":"What an amazing concept, such thought goes into every burger and it shows. Try every burger, trust me it's worth it.

PS: Shakes are an added plus."}
{"text":"Strange menu combinations and flavorless. My husband is not sure he received what he ordered. He thought it was weird tasting too. I had the burger that had the blue cheese.  The lady next us had the same thing and complained about the lack of flavor too."}
{"text":"saw this place on tv and it looked so good. i was happy to find out that it was close to the hotel me and my son were staying at. the place is popular, so that means youre going to wait for your table. but its worth the wait trust me! the hostess and other workers were so nice, a plus when the customer service is great. there was seven of us, including three kids and everyone liked everything we ordered. i had the kiki burger and my son had the kids burger. i would have to say that my burger is the top one or two burgers i ever had. during the time i was eating, i had to tell myself that i was eating a burger, because it tasted more like a steak then a burger. my sons burger looked like a regular size burger. my son said it was his favorite burger. he almost finished the whole thing. i really cant wait to eat here again, but i heard theres one coming to l.a. YES!!!!!!!!!BABY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST BURGERS I HAVE EVER EATEN! 

I ordered the Miyaki-San Burger medium well cooked, and I honestly couldn't have thought of another burger to order because this burger had all of my favorite condiments in it! Onion Rings, Fried Egg, Bacon and a juicy hamburger meat! 

I also recommend the Oxtail Fries with a fried egg on top!

My reason for the 4 stars is because the service was not that great, the waitress did not check up on that many times"}
{"text":"Great service and super yummy food!
Before I come to this location, I've been to bachi burger once, I don't have too much memories of my last experience, but this one is just fantastic.

When I enter with my boyfriend the waiter greeted us politely. And later on turned out he was so attentive (checking on us every 5 minutes, which feels a little bit weird but I know he's doing it out of care)

We ordered the shogun burger, which was sooooo amazing! I usually hate burgers due to their greasy taste but after having this one I just can't help but craving for it all the time!

I love this place and will definitely come back (hopefully not too much to keep my shape tho lol!)"}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to the hype! The boyfriend and I stopped by at dinner time for our weekly date night, and could not have been more pleased! The food was every bit as delicious as it looked like in the photos, and decently priced. The service was great as well. Our waitress was adorable, I believe her name was Ashley G., and she was very attentive along with the rest of the service staff. I had the spicy miso burger, and my boyfriend had the myiagi-san burger. Both were amazing! I definitely recommend that you stop by this place for your gourmet burger fix rather than braving the strip and racking up a $100 bill for something that leaves you hungry 20 minutes later. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here, my mind was blown at how interesting and delicious all the food was. That was a year and a half ago. When I came back to Vegas recently, I made sure to revisit this off-strip place...I had good memories about the momotaro drink, ox tail fries, and delicious burgers with taiwanese style buns and perfectly cooked meats. I think my expectations were a little too high for the place after dreaming about it for so long, but nonetheless, they were still met! We ordered 3 different burgers and cut them each in half so that we could all get some variety."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places! Loved everything that I tried! This place is a bit of a wait to get in, but is worth it! The only complaint is all of the damn flies, they are annoying!"}
{"text":"Really liked Bachi HLK, but I am more excited to have a Bachi Burger close to home. Have consumed many burgers in this town and the burgers here are by far the best in Vegas. Just tried the chili cheese oxtail fries. A giant portion that easily feeds two people. Great flavors with salt being the dominant flavor. Ended the meal with the dessert that is made just at this location, bread pudding. The bread pudding tastes like it is made from a banana nut bread which in itself is excellent. Add on a bourbon glaze and you have perfection. Get an extra side of the bourbon glaze to appease your sweet tooth. For a drink I tried the green tea which stood up to its name. It was greener than a spinach and spirulina smoothie. By far the strongest green tea I have ever had. All and all I will stick with my favor burger, the Ronin burger. Great service that is both helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was expecting, but the burgers are amazing as well as the oxtail fries.  The menu looks very interesting and I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and have never left disappointed! The food is of a great quality, and is flavorful, to boot. They're open late (often until 2 a.m.) and they're pretty consistent in the number of patrons inside (usually 70-80% full). The staff is friendly, and willing to answer questions. Burgers are also offered protein-style for those who don't want--or cannot--eat so much bread.

Their Truffle Parmesan fries are AMAZING, and a real deal at $4. (You can definitely share them among 2 people, but I'd get more orders for a larger group).  The sausage appetizer is tasty, as well; but it's only really for one person.

The only qualm I have about this place is their speed of service; it usually takes about 20-25 minutes to receive your food, so don't arrive starving. That having been said, this remains one of my favorite late-night restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great price! The duck was the best duck I have ever. My next Vegas trip this will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"OMG! The good reviews are no lie. This place is REALLY good. Of course I originally saw it featured on Triple D and had to try it. I convinced my husband to check it out after a late night out (they were open til midnight). We ordered the Ronin burger, Oxtail chili cheese fries, and the Pork Belly Buns. The wait was decent (probably less than 15 mins) for the time of night, about 9:30 pm.

The Ronin was an excellent choice if you just want to dip your taste buds into the Asian infused waters of this place. My husband (who's half Vietnamese) was nervous about trying the Kalbi burger, which has Kimchi. Go figure. But after sharing the Ronin with me, I think he's willing to come back to try all the burgers. The fries were delicious too. We'll have to also try the Parmesan Truffle Fries next time. My husband wanted to try a Pork Belly Bun, but half of the burger and fries filled him up and he couldn't eat another bite.

My son was asleep by the time we arrived and was too tired to wake up to eat, but we ordered the Pork Belly Buns for him just in case he woke up in the middle of the night and was hungry. Well, just as expected, he woke up at 2 in the morning and was hungry and ate the buns and he said they were good. He ate all three!

We will definitely be back here several times to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Sat down at a table just my boyfriend, myself & twin babies. Wasn't acknowledged for 10 minutes. No menus, no drinks. A group of 4 men came in a few min after us & we noticed they already had menus & drinks with a waiter taking their order shortly after being seated. 

My boyfriend went up to ask the hostess who sat us down for menu & she just handed it to him. When that happened I decided we were going to leave. We weren't up to paying for neglected service."}
{"text":"With 600 plus reviews i would think they were good. Well guess not.. went to the location in summerlin, nv off sahara and fort apache. We ordered 3 waters and onion rings.. 10 min later onin rings show up no water. We had to ask someone else for water. Should of known to walk out. Ordered 3 burgers.  1 was right, 2 wrong. 1 was burnt, *raw* grilled onions, asked for fully cooked egg got runny, ate about 1/2 and had to stop. 2nd wrong one, asked for mayo didnt get it. Had to go to the kitchen and flag someone down as no one would stop when i was calling to them or waving just to get it. The salt and pepper garlic fries where horrible, taste too much like rosemary and no garlic in the whole basket. If we were not in a rush we would of walked out and went elsewhere. This is a chain and my 1st experance is -1 but i can only give 1 star as the lowest. As a foodie who just started yelping this place is horrible and the rest of the locations suffer because I wont go in one ever."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot. It is not good as Umami burger, in my opinion, but the Ronin burger was amazing. I cleared the plate within minutes. I did not like the truffle fries as much as I had hoped to. However, the service was awesome and fast. We came in during lunch time and got a table right away. But, there are always lines, so beware!"}
{"text":"From the service to the food all was excellent.  Second time I come here. First time, tried the miso burger and didn't like it.  Try it if only like really strong flavors.

Today we tried the oxtail fries, pork belly buns and Miyagi San burger, and a tall glass of Sapporo.

 The oxtail fries where good but a little more meat and chili don't hurt. The burger was go to hell and go to heaven at the same time. Juicy, plenty of flavor for all the extra stuff especially the crunching of the onion rings. The flavor profile of the burger or meat itself can't get it. You could taste the grass fed part if it was plain.

The pork belly buns melt in your mouth, the radish tasted as a lettuce. Why? I don't know but it work good all together. Overall was good and the service always on point. Well definitely come back and try a different burger for sure."}
{"text":"Visited on 06-30-2017.  Saw a review on them and decided to try a burger before flight.  Lunch time, 12:40. Seated quickly (beat rush) ordered Kiki burger an d manderian oorange some.  Buyer took a while, but very busy.  Burger arrived, if this tastes as good as it looks ,oh yea!  It does. Cooked how I ordered flares melding together, it was a winner.  Oh now it is pricy, burger and soda tax, tip  $21.00.  Well worth it it you love burgers. Definatly a must visit."}
{"text":"The best burger in Las Vegas in my opinion!!! I'm not really a big fan of burger and would only eat it due to cravings. But this place makes me a huge burger fanatic! I really love the Kiki burger.  I've tried the Banh mi burger and Ronin burger which are also good and flavorful. But the Kiki burger is by far my favorite.  Don't forget to try their truffle parmesan fries and stir fried garlic chili edamame. Mmmmnnnn, so good! I can't wait to come back to this place and try their other specialty sandwiches and burgers.  The service was excellent as well. Food came out right away, cooked just how we liked it.  The servers were prompt in refilling our drinks and clearing stuff away as we lick our plates clean...okay, that's an exaggeration! I think the prices are reasonable for the portions it comes in.  Try this place and you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Great food as always, great service from Kelly H. - she was very patient with all of my wife's questions. I had a burger and the wife had the pot stickers. We  definitely recommend the Ox tail fries......AWESOME."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and was extremely disappointed. They do not have enough staff so if you go here be prepared to wait. We were seated within a few minutes but no one ever came by our table. After about 10 minutes we just left. I could understand if the restaurant was busy but there were only two tables in the restaurant when we were seated and no one ever came by to even say hi or say we'll be right with you."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The burger is absolutely fantastic, i am craving for it now and this rating is from someone who don't really like burger. Shogun burger and oxtail chilli cheese fries are my favorite. Get ready to wait, but worth it. Staff is very friendly and service is good. I am sorry that some of you have bad experience but me and my groups did not have that."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good. The fries are okay. The only negative thing about this place is the time we waited for our food. Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Ox tail fries super legit.  Pricey ass beer that I couldn't pronounce it's name.  Also super legit."}
{"text":"Great sweet potato fries and burgers.  Also has IPA beers."}
{"text":"Unique place! Great find. If your looking for something new and exciting to try - come here!! 

I highly recommend the chili cheese fries!

This is the best burger I've ever ate. Hands down."}
{"text":"It's not a burger joint...

So said a friend of mine.  Is she high?  Not always.  Is she insane?  Totally.  But she does have a point.  

Where can you get a burger with kim chee or miso dressing on it?  Want a braised short rib sandwich in a bao bun?  Even Burger King won't make it this way!

I had the Kiki's burger.  I'm a bacon whore and this thing has caramelized bacon, so c'mon how could I even think about ordering something else?  I asked for it to be cooked med rare, which the waitress was more than happy to take note of.  

When my bacon came out, it was delish!  It wasn't quite enough for my taste, but it was placed between (what looked at tasted like) sweet bread, some damn fine shrooms and  a thick, juicy patty.  Other than more bacon, I would have liked a more flavorful cheese (or maybe just a bit more) and for the meat to be cooked less.  It was more pink than red, but it was still tasty.

Aside from my bacon burger, we had sweet potato fries (awesomely crisp on the outside and tender throughout) and truffle fries (quite ordinary and plain, IMHO).  I also had an iced green tea, which was really dark and dense (the way I make it at home) compared to most other places I've had it.  

Overall, the food was good.  Not mind blowing, but definitely a departure from your typical neighborhood burger joint."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointing! I decided to order from this place after reading so many good reviews, and it was within 2 miles of my friend's house. I called last Thursday at around 6:10 pm. I placed an order with 3 custom burgers (2 wagyu, 1 angus) and a specialty wagyu burger. Three of the orders were straightforward, one had an extra patty with cheese+an egg.

 I place the order, which in all takes the girl about 10 minutes to complete. She says confidently that it will be ready in 35 minutes. I arrive exactly 35 minutes after my order was placed. Granted, it is a smaller building and they were busy, but they appeared to be fully staffed. I walked up to the hostess and said I had a call-in order. She went to the kitchen to check on it and re-appeared letting me know it would be another 15 minutes. I don't have a problem waiting for quality food, but I do have a problem with not being told the appropriate wait time.

 It took nearly another 15 minutes on top of the already 15 min-too-long order. And instead of the hostess directing you to the bar to retrieve your food and pay, she just stares at you expecting you to know to stand at the end of the awkwardly positioned counter to flag down someone else to help me. To top it all off, the order was wrong in multiple ways and the burgers were cold. I paid over $80 for this disaster meal. 

 I ate at Holsteins in the Cosmo the next day and was reminded of what a delicious burger is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"I wish they had a reasonably priced lunch menu.  I work around the corner and have wanted to try this place forever.  it was good, and if I could have gotten out of there for 15 bucks, I would say it was really good.  but, the menu is so limited and the only burger I really wanted came with kobe beef.  add some fries (no drink) and a tip and I was out 25 bucks.  the burger was slightly overcooked.  salt and pepper fries were very good.  service was fine.  it's a one-time kind of place for me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to try this after seeing it featured on Food Network. 

Great choice! 

We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, but it was worth it. 

I ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. It was piled high, mostly with the beef patty and onion strings. It was hard to put in my mouth, but once I managed to smash it in, it was like biting into my dream food. Juicy, plump meat with fresh, perfectly cooked bacon and onion strings. Ahhh, so good.

We also ordered a sangria, which I didn't care for, but finished anyway. It was a tad too bitter for my taste. 

We also tried their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, which came in a large portion, and were also very good, but had slightly unusual toppings. I've definitely never had chili cheese fries with fried egg before. But it was good!

We'll definitely be hitting up this place again the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"So I came here with too high of expectations and I was doubting this burger place. Everyone put it up on a pedestal and I just thought it was some fact expensive \"not worth it\" places. BOY WAS I WRONG. Everyone in our party of eight received their burger in fifteen minutes, and it was like a gift from heaven. Perfectly juicy and the bun was crisped just right. Every drop of sauce is blended in with the mix of a variety of assorted condiments and vegetables on your burger, and this makes in-n-out wish it had never been born. Go here, and indulge in a burger that makes you satisfied."}
{"text":"I was truly impressed with my Miyagi-son burger. The carmelized bacon was a taste of exploding heaven! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best burgers around. Every Time I have guests that come from out of town I like to take them to this Las Vegas hidden gem, it is located on the more quite side of Vegas which makes things really nice, especially when trying to get away from the always busy Strip. The staff is always super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable when deciding on menu items. I have had several items on the menu and I can say they are all a safe bet, deffnintly give this place a shot if you are in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"I heard some pretty good reviews so we thought we would give it a shot. I took my family and when they sat us they took forever to come over to serve us. It was a very slim Oriental young man and he had a major attitude like he was either stressed out or upset. They were not even that busy. So we ordered the lonely bird and he told us that they're out of that. This is a Friday night and they're out of their turkey / chicken burger that from what I understand is a popular meal. Great management.  We are historically very loyal and great customers. I will never go back to her again"}
{"text":"Well, I'm a vegetarian and they took the \"That's Cheesy\" item off the menu, so now I can't join my friends when they dine here. This place can get a little busy causing long wait times and horrible service. Once it took my party of 8 almost an hour to get our meals! They didn't even offer to bring us our fries first! At least we got apologies? Whatever. Apologies do not mean anything to a big hungry group of people. 2 Stars for the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Apple Lychee Soda."}
{"text":"Dan was our server for our first visit and was crazy awesome and honest!  He warned me about portion size and what to add on or what to leave the way the chef recommend and im huge on Food Network places. I was personally on MAN VS FOOD Cleveland for MELT BAR AND GRILLED and this place remind me of the edgy vibe of east coast restaurants and i climaxed. The food was so sick i climaxed.....this server though needs a raise or some you rock free DRANKS. He seriously was slammed and gave epic service...I work downtown serving and I can juggle and I was impressed....thank you guys a zillion...I need and really wanna try those damn oxtail fries soon though....one thing I was Un happy about was my meT was way way over cooked for MR..."}
{"text":"Food is always great. I've been here numerous time and the service is always the same...terrible and slow. It's been 30 minutes now and I'm still waiting for my burger. So far I've only received my water, not even any fries. The sad part is, the table next to me that came after received their stuff and they came after me. Does not make sense! If it wasn't for the food I would never come back."}
{"text":"For day two of my friends' bachelor/bachelorette Vegas extravaganza we went to Bachi Burger for lunch.

Menu:
- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50)
- Salt and Pepper Garlic French Fries ($4.00)
- Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.00)
- Shogun Burger ($25.00)
- Kalbi Burger ($9.00)
- Kiki's Burger ($10.00)
- Ronin Burger ($10.00)
- Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato
- Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda
- The Katsushiro

Our party of 11 arrived around 1:30pm on a Monday. The restaurant was about half full, but there was no space large enough for our group. We waited about 20-30 minutes before a table was cleared. Since we had to wait for a table we already knew what we wanted to order when we were sat.

Our server was pretty nice and relatively attentive. 

The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with garlic aioli and fried egg was delicious! The chili was pretty tasty and I loved the fresh cilantro and jalapeno slices the fries were garnished with. The portion is pretty big so sharing this is a good idea. The other fries were also pretty good, nothing particularly outstanding, but good enough.

I decided to go with the Kalibi Burger (Angus beef, kalbi marinade, house made kimchi, green onions, and ko chu jang mayo) because I love Korean food and Korean flavors. This burger was delicious. I asked for my burger medium, and while it was a little more of a medium rare, it was well seasoned and juicy. The house made kimchi was pretty good and the ko chu jang mayo was tasty, too. The burger also came with a little side of kimchi style cucumbers, which were delicious. I would totally get this again.

Two of my friends decided to go with the Shogun Burger (Waygu beef, unagi, poached asian pear, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, yamamomo peach). This was delicious, and it better be for $25. All the flavors married really well together and made this burger really tasty. Both who ordered it were very satisfied. I had a bite of the Ronin Burger (Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, yuzu citrus aioli), which was pretty tasty, as was Kiki's Burger (Angus beef, sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli), which was also pretty tasty.

For dessert we ordered the Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato after seeing a picture of it posted at the entrance of the restaurant. I think it looked better in the picture than it tasted. The donuts were a little doughy and dense. I liked the coffee gelato, but I mean, it was coffee gelato. 

The Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda was pretty tasty. The Katsushiro (alcoholic) was also pretty good, according to the bachelorette. 

Overall, I thought Bachi Burger was pretty tasty. I'd definitely come back here for a burger."}
{"text":"For the LOVE of FOIE!!

I knew I had to make a trip to out Bachi Burger the next time I was in Las Vegas when I heard about the Shogun Burger!

I could tell that this restaurant was not your ordinary burger joint after taking one glance at the menu.  This is one of the more modern restaurants that serve types of burgers you would not typically find at your local burger joint.  Bachi Burger offers various Japanese-inspired burgers, dishes, and sides. 

The SHOGUN BURGER consists of Wagyyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA#Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA).  To be honest, my first bite was a little overwhelming from all the different flavors going on, lol.  But all the flavors melded together perfectly.  The wagyu beef was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  The sweetness and tender poached Asian pear.  The rich, pan seared, slice of foie gras.  All of this, drizzled in miso butter, topped with arugula, in between a home made sweet bun  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw#W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw).  Foie is already very rich to begin with, so I was not able to finish this burger in one sitting-- especially since we ordered sides as well.

I tried some of my friend's CRUSTy CRAB Burger, but the burger was too salty for my liking.  It was difficult to taste all the flavors and ingredients in the burger but it wasn't too bad.  (Crab cake burger with mango chutney and tartar sauce).  The concept of making a \"Spongebob-type\" burger is cute though.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg#JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg).  

The SWEET POTATO FRIES were fresh, crispy, lightly salted, and served with a Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg#xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg).  If you are  afan of sweet potato fries, you will not be disappointed!

The TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were delicious.  Made with fresh cut potatos, tossed in white truffle oil, parmesan reggiano, porcini cream, served with sun dried tomato aioli  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QgvNAbzuAF7sNnz7TpFy0g&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A).  

If I weren't so full I would have ordered a few more items on the menu that made my mouth water:  the Peking Style Duck Steamed buns, Pork Belly Steamed Buns,  and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  But that's just a few more reasons to come back! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would, only because after we were seated, we repeatedly had to hear the chef curse at his crew during our dinner with our family.   The food was bland and disappointing, as was the experience.  So upset."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I ordered the Ronin and it was pretty delicious. So delicious that it's the only thing I ever order. As for fries, I've tried both the regular and truffle sauce fries. Truffle sauce.. eh. The combination of truffle sauce and salty fries just doesn't fit my palette. But overall the food was absolutely wonderful. 

I'm giving this restaurant three stars though because of the service. I came in and had to wait almost an hour and a half for my food to come out. It wasn't jam packed busy either so I don't know what the deal was. Also, every other time I come, the waiters take a while to ring up my check. Like an extremely long while. Like I should order another burger to kill time. There isn't a hostess either so you pretty much just wait until a server sees you and seats you. 

As for price, I went in with my boyfriend a few times and for two burgers two drinks and one side of fries, our bill came to about $35 which isn't bad overall. I'd probably come here again but not cause of the service, but for the amazing burgers."}
{"text":"Hubby & I loved the burgers, had the ronin & the Kiki burger. Like everyone says it's big & juicy & tasty. We had the sweet potato fries & the salt pepper fries. Sweet potato fries were great, the salt pepper fries were spicier then expected & also came with cilantro which hubby hates. Ordered the marshmallow milk shake which was pretty good! Only thing it's pretty pricey for a burger joint but I guess equal to a place like Johnny rockets. Also service was good until it got busy then our server was over worked and hardly checked in with us n took forever for the bill."}
{"text":"We went to this place the other night based on all the reviews left. Well we have no idea how they got so many reviews. For 3 of us with burgers and an appetizer was almost $80

For additional dressing for a salad was an extra .50 cents. 

Burgers were average at best. Customer service was horrible. Will not be coming back again"}
{"text":"The hype is medium. Just like my burger. The 1 hour+ lines are normal, and make sure you realize it's 13 mins off the strip and there are 2 locations.

The oxtail fries were 'good.' Most people live and die by these (and the truffle fries I didn't try), but I thought the oxtail was too much chili like and not tender shreds of tail like. The fried egg on top of fries is definitely amazing.

The burgers are hit and miss:
Ronin burger - reminded me of eating sushi rolls in a burger. Tons of great miso glaze, a fried egg, carmelized onion, multiple BBQ and other glazes. Delish. Worth $11.

Kiki burger - great use of 3 types of asian mushrooms, grueye cheese and sauce. Worth $11.

Miyagi-san grass fed Wagyu burger - very average. Didn't taste amazing. Tasted like a regular burger. Not worth $14.

Shogun burger - wagyu beef with foie gras. Didn't taste anything special at all. Definitely not worth $26, even with asian pear, miso butter and asian peaches inside. Skip it.

3.5 stars overall. The taste is very good, but it's not as amazing and not worth an hour-2 hour wait in my opinion. Definitely give it a try though."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place
Solid 4 stars, I was hoping it would be a 5 but maybe I need to try another burger next time. 
The Boba tea was good, I had the lychee
The fries were packed with flavor. I had the Salt N Pepper and loved the cilantro and jalapeño mixed in. 
The burger I tried was the Black and Green. It was pretty good, but I didn't even finish it. It was kind of bland other than the cheese, possibly because it followed some very flavorful fries. 

It will become a regular stop, now that I found it."}
{"text":"I just landed in Las Vegas and happened upon this place and it was the best burger I ever had!  Must order Wagyu. It is worth the premium."}
{"text":"I'm middle of the road on this one. After watching this local joint on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives Guy F. did a great job talking this place up. I think it left me with super high expectations, so I'm trying to be fair here.

The food itself was really good. I had an entree salad, hubs had oxtail fries. I don't think the portion sizes matched the price tag; after tip $28! I get that you pay for quality ingredients, but on an entree salad I doubt the amount of chicken I was served really justified a $10 price tag considering the portion size.

I was a little bothered by the lack of description of the dish. My salad for example said: House Salad, description: free-range chicken. Nothing else. What bothered me is I had to ask about dressing, didn't think to ask about what else is in it as house salads are pretty generic. So color me shocked when it came with walnuts. Um, what if I had a severe nut allergy? Don't you think that might have changed my order?

The atmosphere was... dull. Waitress had 0 personality, the clientele was yuppy-hipster types (not my thing). The place had no personality, just some enlarged photos of Japanese store fronts.

I don't know. I just didn't get it. 5 star on taste, 2 star on everything else, meet in the middle for a 3 star on yelp."}
{"text":"After many months of going by Bachi, I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did.  We went in late afternoon and were seated immediately--there were only two other tables occupied.  Our server was Allen and he was very good about answering questions.  He first found out we were first timers, so he was eager to help.

I ordered the Black and green burger, a burger made from American wagyu with mushrooms, spinach, bacon, bleu cheese and garlic.  I thought my wife would get a plain burger with cheese but she surprised me by wanting the Kiki burger.  We also got an order of salt and pepper garlic fries.

The burgers were fantastic!  We each enjoyed what we had ordered.  The burgers were very juicy and I love the soft buns they make fresh daily.  The fires were good but I didn't taste any garlic.  They were salted nicely and they had a couple of thin jalapeño slices which was nice.

It came time for dessert and we had decided we'd have the tasting of three flavors of ice cream sandwiches.  It turned out that they had sold the last ones the night before.  I asked if the molten chocolate cake actually took 20 minutes and Allen confirmed this.  We had no place to go so we decided to order the cake and just wait.  After about 20 minutes, one of the chef's came to the table with our dessert and apologized for the way it looked, assured us it would taste a lot better than it looked, and told us it would be no charge.  Something had gone awry and the cake just didn't hold its form and it looked a bit flattened.  He was correct--it was delicious.  I still want to go back and try the triple flavors ice cream sandwiches and I need to try their salted caramel, toasted marshmallow shake.

When we left, Andrea said to me that we should go there once a week.  I said no.  Maybe once a month or so but there are so many good places to try.  I really liked Bachi!"}
{"text":"Loved the burger! Definitely pretty pricey, but delicious. I got the Miyagi-san burger with wagyu beef. The beef patty was soooooo goooooood. Slightly sweet, definitely tasted the beef and the slight char flavor from the cooking process. The burgers took a while to come out, but I quickly forgot how long I've waited after eating the burger. I always love the fried egg in burgers. Makes a creamy consistency and texture to the burger itself. I didn't know how to eat it because of the onion rings in it. But that also gave it amazing flavor. It was my mistake, but I didn't know it didn't have any vegetables in it, which would balance out some of the strong salty/sweet/char broil flavor that was in the burger.

I wish I had gotten the oxtail fries because we got the salt/pepper garlic fries and they were perfectly fried. Soooo goood. It had garlic chili aioli that complemented well with the fries, but it didn't have enough garlic flavor (in either the fries or the sauce). Though, take the quality of the french fry and mix it with the oxtail and I think I would've enjoyed it soo much.

My friend got the Lonely Bird sandwich and it came with a herb pesto which I loved so much and took that for myself to put in my burger to give it some herb flavor. I wonder if I could get the herb pesto in my burger instead of the chili mayo that my Miyagi-san burger came with. Maybe that would have a better rounded out flavor.

LOVED this place still. Will want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I had the 

Miyagi-San Burger which is a Grass Fed Wagyu Beef Burger med cooking which was juicy and yummy.  above average

Ox tail chili fries Now this was money.  super good worth the trip

Truffle fries was good

overall great food.  kind of like unami burger in the SF and LA area. 

Service was so so. and i was there on a fri at 1 so after the rush"}
{"text":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!
 Very disappointed with our entire experience. We came on a Monday evening around 7 pm and there was a small wait, about 15-20 mins.

When we got seated, our table wasn't wiped down so there was spilled water and/or ramen on the table that we had to wipe ourselves.

We sat there for about 10 mins and someone brought us water.....ANOTHER 15 mins later, we asked a server walking  by to please take our order! Really!?! 25 mins just to order!
We ordered:
- House made pickles: not good, don't waste your $6
- Pork belly buns: good, but nothing to rave about
- Mr. Ho's burger, Bahn mi burger & Ronin burger: meat itself was good but all the fixings ruined our meals
- Black garlic ramen: Tasty
- Portuguese donuts: Too greasy

Had to flag someone down to refill our waters.
Would NOT go back...they really need to work on their  customer service. Really really disappointed from beginning to end Triple D!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times but this was the first time I've gone since the management change. Our server took over 15 minutes to greet us, I had to literally pull aside someone and ask them to get our server. After we ordered he came back 10 minutes later to tell us they couldn't even make the drinks we ordered. After reordering it took 15 min for the drinks to come and another 45 for our food. Our fry appetizer never came. And my ramen came out with meat in it after I had asked for no meat. I had to find our server once again to order another round and ask for the check. At this point he told us he would take care of our drinks and the fries. When I got the bill the fries and drinks were still on there so I had to ask him to remove it. He then removed it and ran our bill and came back with our friends boxed up. That would have been an hour fifteen minutes waiting for the fries at that point. Our server only had a 4 table section too so he couldn't have been that busy. Also no manger ever was seen on the floor. 

I also found out the next day they were on Vegas dirty dining for having cockroaches everywhere so after both those things I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My friend had been raving about this place and how we just had to try it. It's way off the strip, about 5 miles so make sure you're willing to drive or take a cab. I heard it was also on one of those food network shows so it's getting more popular by the minute. When we got there around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were groups of people chilling in the parking lot. I was prepared to wait a little bit but it was kinda insane, since we ended waiting probably about an hour and a half. We had a larger party of 6. So maybe that's the reason. But this place is not very big. They also advertised another location but not sure where that one is located. I def recommend smaller groups visiting or coming right when it opens to avoid the tortuous wait. Anyways finally was seated and got to order. Food takes about 15-20 minutes to come out so I recommend getting fries to tide you over. Unfortunately I didn't get a say and someone said yeah, bring everything at one time (instead of staggered or when ready). So I continued to starve a little longer (given it was almost like 3pm now and I had not eaten since dinner/5pm the previous day). This was a bad idea as I proceeded to scarf down my food super fast when it came to the table and my stomach was not feeling all that great about halfway through my burger. At least that's what I choose to believe over something was wrong with the food (ie contaminated or worse). I tried the Kiki's burger with mushrooms, onions, bacon and cheese. It was pretty darn good. And this is really an eat your burger with a fork and knife kind of place. Yeah the burgers are huge. Not sure how I could fit that thing into my mouth. As for the sides, for our big group we tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries. I love oxtail but was a little disappointed with these fries because I couldn't really taste the oxtail in it. It really just tasted like regular chili cheese fries to me but with an egg on top that made it slightly better. Since it was split up between a bunch of it, I only got to have a little bit so I may have to give it another try next time I'm in town. The truffle fries were really good though and I liked the truffle sauce they have on top. Didn't care too much for the sauce on the side - it's not totally needed IMO. Overall a pretty pricey meal. Burgers start at $10 and go up including the $26 fois gras burger. And the chilli cheese fries were like $11 with the truffle fries at about $4. My share with the gratuity charge they tack on with large groups was $20. Good thing I can only come every once in a while when I'm in Vegas. So many good burger combinations to try."}
{"text":"Great Burger restaurant. I highly recommend to go there. Chicken wings are good as well."}
{"text":"Went last night. Keep in mind I've been here dozens of times.  Our server didn't give a hoot about our table of five. We ordered the pickles and they were slimy. Asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like \"hi! Um.....nooooo\". You lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky \"manager\"."}
{"text":"I finally got my first taste of a Bachi burger, and I am happy to announce that I was quite please with my burger and fries. I ordered the Black and Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sautéed Mushrooms, fresh Spinach Bacon
Point Reyes Blue Cheese which I replaces with Gruyere, and Roasted Garlic for $16 with a side of salt and pepper french fries, and I can't for get the ice cold Sapporo's!

I asked for a medium rare temp, and I was very pleased they were able to deliver on the mark. The beef was very moist and tender, however its flavor was milder than what I expected. It was very good, but instead of providing that beefy flavor that lingers on the palate, it provided a milder light buttery flavor. 

The sauteed mushroom was tender to the touch, well seasoned, and tasted great. The bacon was crispy, very flavorful, with a bit of a chew, which I rather enjoy. The fresh spinach was abundant and well stacked on the burger. I got to give them credit, this was a very neat and nicely stacked burger. Also, the bun was very nice with its moist texture and glistening top. 

The fries were very good, but the should of been a little more crispier. I enjoyed their flavor and felt the salt and pepper seasoning was spot on. Also, the garnish of freshly sliced jalapenos and herbs was quite good and a nice touch.

Service was good, but I felt it could of been a little more attentive, and those ice cold Sapporos were just great and made the Black and Green taste that much greater."}
{"text":"Been to bachi and shoku a few times I like that they are one entity. The added bar is a very nice touch. Our server Dan was excellent and knew the menu very well and had some great suggestions. I was able to order from both menus which was a bonus. My oxtail chili cheese fries and octopus pancakes as apps were outstanding. My ramen was to die for. We enjoyed our food soooooo much I had to ask our server for the name of the chef. Chef Don was on point with all our dishes. Thanks Bachi and Shoku we will definitely see you soon"}
{"text":"This was an accidental find while looking for sushi, and I could not be happier. So good that we went back again! Service, food, and prices I thought were 5 stars. Fresh food, cooked perfect! If you are nearby, it is a must go!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say one thing...
The best darn burger I ever had. I drove from LA just to have this burger. YES, I am crazy. Especially after reading a review from this anal retentive Collene. 

I am a chef, and I used to own a restaurant before the economic crash. Kitchens get busy, especially all at once seating on a busy lunch. I support you guys. If you had the time to sit there and watch your clock, 12:45, 12:52, 12:56 then pre order your food. It's a busy place, small and cozy, and yes you'll wait. Its the name of the game. 

If you wanted it fast, go to McDonalds next time. I'm sure you'll walk in at 12:30, and be out 12:32. This is a gourmet burger, and the best in the west.
Great job you guys!!!
Keep up the awesome burger!

I'll drive back soon to see you guys. Its well worth it."}
{"text":"Based on raving recommendations from my friends, I had high hopes for this place. The long wait probably added to my anticipation too. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. Either that or I was hungover from last night's festivities... but I don't think so... 

I was very excited to try the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and they were good, but they didn't blow me away. 

The burgers on the menu seemed carefully crafted and included pan-Asian tastes and flavors. It is a gourmet burger joint, so it wasn't cheap, but it wasn't incredibly expensive either. 

I chose to build my own burger because all the burgers on the menu seemed to have one ingredient that I wasn't fond of. I didn't want to build a burger that was too big for my appetite, in fear that I wouldn't enjoy it, but I probably should've added all of those extras to counter the sweet patty. However, I'm not sure if the price of that would have sat right with me. Anyway... not that the meat was not cooked right--it was quality meat, juicy and well-seasoned--but I just did not enjoy my burger. Maybe it's just me, but when I go for burgers, I expect an all-American tasting burger patty instead of a teriyaki taste. Other people at my table agreed that their burger was overly sweet as well... but what do you expect from a place called Bachi burger--derived from hibachi I assume. 

I would like to come back and try other non-burger items on the menu. Drink-wise, I tried the honeydew milk tea and it tasted like a Melona bar in drink form--yum :) I had to get it to go before the long drive back to OC!"}
{"text":"I've had this place on my yelp bookmark list forever.  Finally returned to Las Vegas two weeks prior and had a rental car available to take me here.  From the main street, it looked like the place was closed because there was a screened patio and no one was sitting there.  When we came by the front and entered we realized it was certainly NOT closed.  Place was pretty full on a Friday afternoon.  We were fortunate to get a seat.

From reading so many reviews, I opted for the Miyagi-San burger (requested medium) and a side of truffle fries.  My husband decided to order off their Shoya ramen menu.  

The burger came, excitement level 9000!  It tasted...good.  But I was severely disappointed that they overcooked my burger!  It was medium well.  No ways around it.  I really feel it being overcooked distracted me from what would otherwise be very delicious flavors.

The Truffle Parmesan fries were good.  The black truffle porcini cream was very tasty.  I wished it had more.  I really didn't taste much of the parmesan however.  The sun dried tomato aioli was forgettable.

Overall, I may have overhyped the place for myself as I left feeling a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best burger joint I've ever been to. I'd write more, but this is already my second review. Lol. I got the same exact burger as last time, Kiki Burger, and it tasted like perfection. The jalapeño pepper fries with pineapple ketchup is like no other. I will always be a fan here!!!"}
{"text":"These are the best burgers I've had since Umami. In fact, I'd consider them a step higher than Umami right now considering how unique and flavorful each bite tastes. This place isn't just trying to be another burger joint, but establishing itself as a real competitor in the world of Asian infused burgers.

The Kiki burger was delectable and simply drowns your palate in rich burger juices with a touch of their unique sauce. I haven't even tried any of the other burgers yet and I think I've already found my favorite. I also ordered the pepper and jalapeño fries with pineapple ketchup and it was pure bliss. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone is sooooo nice here. The customer service is great and of course the food is amazing. Not only will I be coming back as much as possible I will recommend it to my friends. I'm not a huge beef person but I got the lonely bird which was recommended to me and it is more than delicious. Milkshake infused alcohol is amazing as well. Everything is just so perfect about this place."}
{"text":"Me and my friend ate way too much but it was freakin' worth it. We show up around 2pm and there was a 25 minute wait. Plus this is way off the strip like close to the desert off. It was a $30 cab ride from the strip but $10 to the airport. 

As appetizers we got the pork buns and the oxtail chili cheese fries. Holy crap they were so good. The buns were soft and not heavy and the pork belly had enough fat that melted in my mouth. It had the hoisin sauce on the side for dipping which was super tasty and great sweetness to it. I think its not as good as Momofuku's pork buns but its still up there. Probably my second favorite. The oxtail chili cheese-fries was bangin!! It was so heavy because of beans and sunny side up egg but still so worth it. The jalapenos were to hot to eat because of the 113 degree weather but any other day it would have been fine.  We could have stopped eating and that could have been all we ate. Of course we didn't and made ourselves look like fat asses when ordering the burgers. 

He had the Ronin and I had the $26 dollar Shogun burger. The Shogun burger was so rich and soft because it literally melted in my mouth. If I was 76 years old with false teeth and couldn't eat burgers anymore I would be in heaven. It is made of Wagyu Beef & Unagi 
Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach. The bun also  soft and sweet that I really felt that I wasn't eating a lot at all. I think it's over priced by like 3 bucks but I would still recommend it because of the very rich flavors. We tried finishing it all but we realized it was too much food. 

It was funny our waiter Mark was like, \"So you will be having the pork buns as your main course..\" and I stopped him and was like, \"Haha Hell no. I'm getting a burger also.\" And he gave that look like I did not know what I was getting into but sure enough took my order. 

Service was really good. They refilled our waters every second they got and catered to our needs. I wish there was a place like this in the Tri-state area."}
{"text":"I love the kiki burger!!! It's really good.  The Edamame is also pretty good to start with while you're waiting for your delicious burger."}
{"text":"Its great to have a sit down burger place. They have amazing burger and their signature fries. I ordererd the blue cheese burger with out the onions and was heaven I use to be a strip burger fun but not anymore. Bobby the server was amazing he goes above and beyond to please his guests. This is my new favorite burger place"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the world!!! The service was fantastic. I love how the servers work as a team!! No lazy fools like other work places!! I love it! Their oxtail chili cheese fries were AMAZING!!!!! So delicious (I wish they'd put more oxtail) nonetheless, they were on point! The buns are sweet and savory! Meat is tender and juicy! And the sauce is to die for! Kiki and ronin burgers are awesome! Bachi burger is amazing most def recommend. It hits the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Bachi was high on my must-do list during my short Vegas stay.  I opted for the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger.  First, I wonder how different it tastes from their Angus blend as I didn't find the beef overly tender.  That said, the flavor was awesome.  I flattened it as I like them thin versus towering monstrosities, so much delicious spice broth oozed onto my plate.  

The caramelized bacon were in strips, Unfortunately, I thought it was some sort of relish.  $15...mmm...kinda pricy; I recommended the build-your-own Angus for a much better value play.

The pineapple ice tea was delish.  

I was the only customer at around 4 p.m., so a great time if you want to avoid the crowds.  Staff was very cool.  I usually mention parking, but this is Vegas and not Portland, so there was plenty."}
{"text":"I've heard great things, maybe it's just the burgers that are great.....the fried rice is so greasy!  we felt it was inedible. The Spicy Miso looked promising but looks are deceiving. The broth appeared full of color which I expected a world of flavor it was bland boo! Then the wait was so long, we got our appetizer after our meal came. The staff seemed distracted. I won't return I can get a great burger lots of places this experience didn't really make me want to go back. Overrated in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I got the oxtail fries - they were delicious and had a different kick to it. We also ordered the Miyagi burger, which was yummy and the Lonely Bird burger which was scrumptious too!!! The burgers are huge , therefore you can share. And the fries were a big portion too. Prices are decent for what you get as well! So good I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Super tasty but in a weird area of town, at least for our family. Outstanding sides and apps. Food served hot quickly and with care. Reviews of this are accurate. I think they were on one of those food shows too."}
{"text":"I had a bad first impression of this place because of the service. The first time I came here with a friend, it was early afternoon on a weekday and it wasn't that busy. We were immediately seated and able to put our order in quickly too. However, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food to come out. I wish that was an exaggeration, but sadly, it's not. And it was disappointing because it wasn't a big order...it was just my friend's salad and my burger. And we were surrounded by a table of 8 and also a table of 5 who were seated AFTER us but they got their food BEFORE us. Water refills were almost impossible to get as well. I was hungry and upset about the service...I considered walking out before my food got there and never coming back. 

But when my Miyagi San's finally got there and I took a bite...the flavors were just too good. I knew that I would have to be back. The burger was cooked perfectly, the bun didn't get soggy (which is an annoying trait that most burger places have), the flavors were different but in a good way. It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had.

I've been back to this location a few times since then and I've been to another location as well and I didn't have a problem with the service. I don't know why the first time was so terrible."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The garlic Parmesan French fries were good. I had the BBQ burger and it was meh. Far from horrible, but it was nothing to turn flips over."}
{"text":"I have been a ling time fan.  Take the time and het out of the casino if you are from out of town.  Very popular with the locals who are finecky about what they spend there time and money on in a sea of good restaurants.  

Black and green is always awesome with the reyes point blue cheese. 

Bison come with bacon and brie

Always order medium or medium rare!

For a real treat venture away from the burgers and go for the fish sandwich.  It is incredibly good. 

Nice selection of teas that are bottomless including matcha!

Burger aficionados such not miss out on one of the best burgers ever."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to this place and eat in! I tried it for the first time last week, and having never been, I expected more of a fast-food vibe so I got take-out. When I arrived to pick it up I found a somewhat charming little sit-down burger place with a surprisingly large number of people dining in (considering that it is in a strip-mall and I was there at an odd time - around 3pm).

The item I had is not on the menu, but I saw a delicious-looking photo on their website, so I asked about it when I called. The Shogun Burger - kobe beef burger with seared foie gras, BBQ eel, and a special sauce. The bun was perfectly toasted and fluffy, the burger was medium rare, juicy, and delcious, and the toppings were awesome. It was a little heavy on the sauce (I'm not sure exactly what it was) so I would definitely ask for less next time, or even on the side. Also, it was a very very rich sandwich, so make sure you're in the mood for that before ordering.

Service was friendly and quick! Can't wait to go back and try their other specialty burgers."}
{"text":"Food was great, the service was a little slow at first. I believe they were lacking a host or hostess, that would explain why we stood in the front for about 15mins. Regardless we were eventually seated and the food was very good from the wings to the Salt & pepper garlic fries, to the fish sandwich, ending up with burger but without the egg on top! Not bad overall!"}
{"text":"What a sad state of affairs to experience at a place I held at such high regard for so many years. I think the concentration of combining two restaurants into one, along with hiring trendy people with fully tattooed arms,  men that have ponytails and handlebar mustaches has definitely gone to this pathetic crews head of what service really is. With a total of four tables being served I waited 10 minutes to see by a girl who \"was heading outside anyway\". To sitting at a table where I have to get my own napkins this was about as pathetic as one could get. 

Now on to the food... wanting something light I have always been a fan of brussel sprouts and fried rice. If you cannot execute the food do not serve the damn food! Burnt to a crisp this brussel sprouts were absolutely atrocious. The fried rice was so laden in fat as well as lacking of  fundamental seasoning.

I know this restaurant pulled its claim to fame with unique flavor combinations and being on the Food Network. If it keeps on the path it's going it will be back on the Food Network only with Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible tried to save this disaster!"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever tasted. Everything here is good. I love the truffled fries. I try something new each time and I never regret coming here. Bachi is truly amazing."}
{"text":"I can never come here and not get their oxtail chili fries, they are so good! I totally recommend them!! I always clean the plate when I get them lol. The burgers are very tasty and filling too. They have so many different types of burgers, but they all sound so delicious it's hard to choose from. All in all, Bachi Burger definitely doesn't disappoint guys!!"}
{"text":"If you are between having a burger or Asian food, this place can address both of your cravings.  Very unique food.  This place is usually busy on a Saturday night; that's a good sign!"}
{"text":"Nice spot to check out, especially if you're a TV foodie. Oxtail chili cheese fries are a must try! Most of the burgers we tried were good, but not really as good as everyone else made them out to be. 

Also, the server got our orders wrong and had to go back to correct herself more than once. Maybe it was an off-day when I went, but I was not impressed. I'm hoping my next BB experience in LA will be better. I'll give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying the food is great. The prices are a bit high for a burger place, but not high at all for the type of food you get.  The reason I am only giving Bachi a 3 star and not a 5 is becouse our server Matt. He seemed like he was on something that made it where he couldn't think straight, he truley seemed so high that he couldn't even remember that he wrote down our order. 

When we first got to the table he took our drink order and then came back about 5 minutes later with the drinks and took our dinner order. I the server was a bit off when he kept making stupid comments about Bachi Burger (it truely seemed like he hated the place he works at). Also his eyes where dilated and he couldn't hold still long enough to take our whole order and kept interrupting in the middle of sentences. He also didn't let us tell him we wanted appetizers becouse he wouldn't shut his mouth so we had to wait until her finished taking the burgur orders to get a word in to tell him we wanted appetizers. He asked if we wanted them before the meal or with and we told him before. 

Well 45 minutes later I told my table that this was strange that we haven't saw are waiter or food in since he took our order and about five minutes after that the burgers show up. I then ask where the appetizers where and Matt told us \"oh shit I forgot, I will get those right out to you\". Just wondering how the hell he forgot when he wrote it down? Either that or he just acted like he wrote it down, who knows. 

Well we finish our burger and at this point Matt hides again and other servers have to do everthing for us. Like bring us the appetizers 5 minutes after we ate our burgers (I guess their appetizers are now our dessert)? Well you would think that after the appetizers coming out this late they would take something off our bill of $108 for 4 people, but no they didn't even take off one of the two appetizers). 

So would I suggest you try Bachi Burger, Yes, but I would recommend telling them you would like any other server then Matt. The rest of the servers seemed to be doing a great job with their tables, but the people next to us that had Matt as a server where also upset with him as well."}
{"text":"Came for early dinner on a Friday evening w/o reservations- we got seated immediately, but I think we might've juuuust missed the rush, bc the restaurant was packed within 30mins. Every burger on the menu looked better than the last- I had the Miyagi-San, recommended by the waiter, which was absolutely amazing! Started w the pickles and parmesan fries, if we had room for more, the oxtail chili cheese fries would have def been a choice- 

I'm from LA and lived though the last 2 years of the burger craze out there, including Umami, and gotta admit, Bachi is my new fav! 

Our waiter was incredibly nice, knowledgeable and VERY helpful! thanks!!"}
{"text":"Killer veggie burger - and it's healthy too (which is a huge bonus)... Amazing lamb burger (withy Indian favors which we really appreciate)... Ok ok fries... Sauces were good - not great... Come here just for the burgers... Like literally get nothing else.. 

They also serve ramen in the same restaurant - which is weird...

The lady who served us was really sweet and patient.. Rest of the staff were ok - it was kinda hard to get their attention. Almost seemed like they were avoiding eye contact to avoid serving us.. 

Overall - I would def come back and hope that I get seated in one of the tables covered by our lovely waitress!"}
{"text":"Now that I've come back here since my first time about 4 times, it's time to change my review to 5 stars!  

1 star = again for Customer service; they're always so nice and accomodating here.  I love it!

2 stars = alone just for the Miyagi Son burger; best burger ever!  Caramelized bacon?  With an egg inside?  Come on, what's not to love!  

3 stars = for having pork belly and duck steam buns.  I love these things and I can come here to get them anytime I want? Score!

4 stars = for making my boyfriend want to try every burger on the menu until he's tried them all.  So far not one has disappointed him and he's had the Ronin, Mr Ho's, Miyagi Son, and the Black & Green.  He loved every bite of each!

5 stars = for having 3 kinds of edamame, and 3 kinds of french fries to try with the huge variety of different burgers on the menu.  Variety is key to any restaurant so that it keeps customers curious to come back and try more!

Sorry Bachi Burger to have ever doubted you!  I'll be back to try the rest of the menu!  See you real soon!"}
{"text":"Ever since I saw this place featured on Guy Fieri's hit show \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" I had to try their Oxtail Fries. Oxtail Fries looks better than it taste which was a little disappointing, but I will come back again for their Truffle Fries and Salted Caramel Shake. 

SERVICE
Friendly and prompt. Service was on point.

FOOD
Everything was ordered by my self-proclaimed food critic friend. Here's what we got:

Shogun Burger: Consist of wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and yamamomo peach. $26 for a burger might scare some away but I personally liked this a lot. Asked the beef to be cooked medium rare and it was perfect as it could be, so tender and juicy. My main gripe about this burger was the unagi being too fishy. I would have enjoyed this more without unagi.

Truffle Parmesan Fries: Wow, flavor on fleek. Black truffle porcini cream drizzed on the fries had me asking, \"Can fries be this tasty?\" Apparently, it is possible.  Must get this if you are coming to Bachi Burger. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: As seen on TV. It can get spicy because of chili and jalapeno. I personally enjoyed Truffle Parmesan Fries more.

Salted Caramel Shake: Screw Starbucks and their caramel frap. Salted caramel shake with marshmallow here was next level. Perfectly sweetened with caramel and icy texture was super refreshing for me. 

CONCLUSION
Unique and tasty burgers/fries and good service. Can be on the pricier side because of high quality ingredients but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"To continue on with our foie gras kick, we paid Bachi Burger a visit. It's located about 10 minutes off the strip. No glitz, no glamor.  Just some good grub. 

Set up was casual with TV screens everywhere, as typical with other burger joints. Bar in the middle that serves alcohol,  BOBA teas and fruit juices.  Adjacent and connected to a ramen place. Pretty  gnarly that both menus were presented (most likely same owners) and they welcomed ordering from either menu. A burger and some ramen??? Sweet!!

THE FOOD GIST: 
The OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES were quite EYE CATCHING. Our friends posted a pix on facebook and I drooled just looking at it. Bookmarked it instantly.  How can you sit next to someone who ordered this dish and NOT want to have a bite?  This is a MUST HAVE for that very reason.  
Overall, this dish was heavy and was a meal in itself. It was loaded with \"pulled\" oxtail, chili, cheese and topped w/ an oozing fried egg....CRAZEE!!  The fries were just the right size and everything went well together. Loved the garlic aioli!!

SHOGUN BURGER:  Hats off to Bachi Burger for creating a pretty magnificent burger.  The medley of ingredients are standing O worthy and complement each other well.  Check it out:  wagyu beef & unagi. pan seared FOIE GRAS, poached asian pear, miso butter and yamamomo peach. A hint of sweet and savory with every bite. BEST GOURMET BURGER in my eyes.  I recommend DECONSTRUCTING it with foie gras on the side.  I would take a bite of the burger, then a bite of foie gras. YUM-O!. I could've  also done w/o the patty since I'm not a big meat person and it was a bit too heavy.  

I was feeling guilty and had to get a HOUSE SALAD: No bueno. It was blah. Dressing was lacking and greens were a bit too bitter for me. Not an arugula fan. 

STRAWBERRY LYCHEE LEMONADE: 
The waitress was so sweet and patient with me.  It took me forever and a day to decide on a drink.  I was back and forth between a boba tea and soda.  She assured me that this drink was really good and I went for it.  It was refreshing and made w/ fresh strawberries.  Lychee flavor was very mild though. 

SERVICE: Friendly service and food came out at an average pace. 

TID BIT: 
1) Outdoor seating available
2) Kid friendly. 
3) Only 1 public bathroom. Long wait time :(

The hubs and I really enjoyed our experience.  We sat their eating away and were at one with our food.  Will surely be back to try other burgers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after a long drive from LA. Parking is plentiful and the crowd seemed to be a bit younger. Service was friendly. This location serves ramen as well. Having previously eaten Bachi Burger in Pasadena the weekend before, I decided to go with the tonkatsu ramen just because I felt like it. Bad idea. It wasn't satisfying and my soft boiled egg was still cold in the middle. The only thing that I liked was the pineapple ketchup that came with our fries. I don't think I'll be back considering I wasn't wowed at their Pasadena location either."}
{"text":"I've tried it twice, so I guess I have to rate it that I'm a fan. But I have yet to eat there. I hate when the wait is always \"10-15 minutes\" if its not going to be close to that. Both times I left after 30 minutes or more. Good for them to be so busy, bad for me. Fortunately there's an excellent sushi place in the same strip mall. I'll give them another try since my friends say its worth it, but I'll push them on what the delay is going to be. I'm sure the food is great and the customers seemed to be enjoying themselves. We'll just have to see (and at a less popular time.)"}
{"text":"Awesome place. It can get crowded but the food and beer is well worth it. They do have a second location that does not seem to be as popular."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place.  Bomb.com!  Only bad thing was after realizing how awesome the food looked and smelled, I asked to move to a bit larger table to accommodate all the food that was coming our way.  Overall, still worth small wait."}
{"text":"Unique burgers with an Asian twist. The meat quality and toppings were all very fresh  and varied. I had the Miyagi-San burger ($14), which had fried egg, fried onions, bacon, and an interesting sauce. The buns were very fresh and collapsed easy.

One thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the oxtail chili cheese fries ($12). They tasted like generic chili cheese fries and the fried egg was a tad overcooked, resulting in less yolk. Further, you could not really taste any of the oxtail.

The Parmesan truffle fries were solid. The sauce that accompanied them was delicious.

I am rating Bachi Burger 5 stars due to how unique the burgers are and the overall quality. Expect to pay about $25 for a share of appetizer and a burger. Everything is ala cart as well, so be sure to take that into account. 

Great food, nice service. I would go back here."}
{"text":"The food was EXCELLENT.  I had the Miyagi-San and it was yummy. No complaints there at all!  Service.....eh, not so good.
We waited about 15 minutes for a table even though we could clearly see 4 empty tables.  Once we were seated it took about 8 (long) minutes for our waiter to greet us and it took another 10 minutes to get water, and after 15 minutes of waiting for our \"pickle\" appetizer to arrive we finally had to ask the waiter if we could get it before our food arrived.  Our waiter was a little clueless.  SLOW SLOW SLOW and the restaurant was FREEZING so it made the long drawn out dining experience a little painful.  By the time we left it was packed and the parking lot was full of people waiting to be seated.  I would have not been so happy with the whole experience at all if I had to wait even longer for a table and then have the really poor service we had.  I will not go back simply because of the poor service and cold temperature and \"cold\" atmosphere.  Felt very impersonal.  Too bad because the food was pretty tasty but here in Vegas there is plenty of tasty food with excellent service."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers I have EVER had.  I've had good burgers but this places beats them all.  My favorite is the Kalbi burger.  It has a wonderful Korean flare to it.  And the service is astounding!  Average burger price is $8 even for the kids.  There are no kid menus but my 5 and 3 year old devour there bachi BBQ burger."}
{"text":"This is already one of my favorite places in Vegas! I eat paleo, so grass-fed beef is very important to me. You can taste the difference!"}
{"text":"Coerced two more coworkers into bachi burger lunch. 

First, we tried the stir fried ginger chili edamame. Yum yum and yum. They are a total mess to eat but worth every spicy finger and lip licking moment. 

I went out on a limb, after great debate, and tried the spicy miso burger. I was apprehensive about some of the toppings. I should have known NO bachi burger would lead me astray. It was excellent. The burger was way more than mouth sized and sandwiched between a pillowy eggy bun. Amaze!

We also shared the best sweet potato fries that exist! And, of course, I washed it down with my fave, apple lychee soda!! 

Full on food coma ensued and I struggled through my remaining office hours. 

Bachi burger = true lunchtime adventure and joy!"}
{"text":"Oh boy - how this pains me! I am bachi burger lover....I gave the other location 5 stars!  

Well the new location just doesn't have it together yet.  I've been twice.  On the first visit we didn't have any problems.  We tried the Myagi-san?? Grassfed beef burger.  It was delicious.  

Our last visit was such a mess that it would leave a sour taste in anyone's mouth.  I was disappointing because we had a first timer along and I had been raving...needless to say, she wasn't impressed.  

Both times I've been they have switched servers on us mid-meal.  This seems to cause a little too much confusion.  Our edamame took 30 minutes.  That is just a wee excessive for edamame.  We ordered tea, never got it, but were still charged for it.  My hubby didn't get peppers on his burger so they said they would get him some - everyone finished eating and his burger was cold and still no peppers.  They never even ordered them.  Just one thing after another,  It was frustrating.  

The food was still great.  I tried the chili chicken app, it was lightly breaded and flavorful.  I also tried the toasted marshmallow and salted caramel milkshake - very tasty!

I won't give up on bachi burger but they need to get it together over there!  At this point I'd probably drive the 25 miles across town to ensure a good experience."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about their burgers and I finally had a change to try one tonight.  Had the Kalbi burger with some Kim chee.  The burger was good, but for the money...I've had better elsewhere.  I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place and was a little let down.  There is just too much going on with their burgers, meaning their ingredients and toppings.  There is nothing wrong with tweaking a burger but not manhandling it."}
{"text":"Lately, I've become a burger fan. I came here with my girlfriends after the day club and I split a Miyagi san's burger. The burger is a pretty small burger, but I just wanted something to fill my stomach. I had it cooked medium rare-- twas delicious! I loved the onion strings in the burger. 

The sweet potatoes fries were bomb as well! Service was really awesome. They kept checking in on us, making sure our water was filled and our food was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing burgers, but like others, we had very slow service, even though there were 5-6 people around the entire time.

I had the Ronin Burger, and I definitely see myself going back to try others. The others with me had Kiki's Burger, BBQ Bachi Burger American Wagyu, and some of the Steamed Sandwiches.

I highly recommend avoiding the steamed ones, as they are extremely small - nothing but a bun with meat, nothing else, and not a lot of either. Absolutely not worth the price for them. (2 tiny things for $8.50 or more depending on meat).

Everything else was great, including the truffle parmesan fries and garlic salt & pepper fries."}
{"text":"Definitely had high expectations for this place ever since I saw it featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but the food was just alright. Probably because i ordered the wrong thing.  

Came on a Saturday at 12:30pm... just managed to miss the lines.  We sat at the bar.  
I got the MIYAGI SAN burger.  It has fried onion straws, fried egg, bacon and beef patty.  No greens.  Would definitely have liked some sort of green or something lighter to balance out the other heavy flavors. The first few bites were quite good, then it just got too heavy for me.

Boyfriend got the Korean BBQ burger; that one was much better!  I loved the gochu jang aioli! Great flavor balance.

We also ordered the kurobata sausage appetizer... it was good, but it's like Asian lil smokies. Nothing too special.

The donut holes dessert were hard as a rock and not worth getting at all.

All of the above plus 2 drinks = $60 lunch (post-tip). I am very curious about the banh mi burger and i would go back just to try that one."}
{"text":"Waited a little bit to get in midweek after 1 pm.  Seems to be the norm based on other reviews.

Ok doesn't matter which burger you order, they are all awesome so i wont break them down.  We ordered 4 different ones and all were awesome. Salt and garlic fries very tasty. Truffle fries same story.

Service was just ok.

Definitely will be back when in las vegas"}
{"text":"Food was good. I had a double burger forgot what it was called but was really good. We went 20 minutes before they closed and they still served us party of 8."}
{"text":"Heard about this infamous burger joint first from one of my co-workers... then as I scoped out the scene here on yelp it totally made me become even more interested in visiting this place... finally during one of my recent trips back to the city of sin I was able to make my way out there to confirm the verdict... and guess what?  It's definitely a thumbs up!

So what is Bachi Burger?  It's a similar concept to Umami Burger that is based in Las Vegas...  Let's jump right into the Pros and Cons... (My new ways of reviewing...)

Pros:  
--Great burger!!!  Had the Kiki Burger and it was off the hook!  The size is as big as expected from a gourmet burger joint so nothing special.. it comes a la carte so your fries will always be an extra order on the side...
--Great truffle parm fries!  Terrific flavor and definitely deserves a recognition!
*totally wanted to try the Oxtail chili fries but didn't get the chance...  The neighboring table ordered one and they literally killed it in about 3 seconds... can't wait to order this entree next time I'm visiting LV!

Cons:
--Location is not too hard to find but it's not obvious either... ample parking though...
--Price is definitely on the higher side.. oxtail chili fries will be around $11 bucks so be prepared to pay for the food... for us one burger, truffle fries, and iced tea ran around $20... so it's definitely a treat more than anything...
--Not on the strip where I'm usually at.. but I guess that's ok... less crazy crowd I suppose.

Verdict: 
I will definitely go back!  In fact... my next trip I'm going to verify how delicious that Oxtail Chili Fries really is... and gotta try the Miyagi Burger too!  So stay tuned for an updated review coming soon!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having dinner here at Bachi burger and let me tell you... it's a great place to have a good burger. The burgers are unique in the flavor and ingredients they use. We came in around 6 and it was empty, making our service really quick. It has a good variety of burgers, and there is also an all day breakfast menu available if you do not want burgers. We ordered truffle fries and a side of onion rings as well.. hint... ask for the pineapple ketchup. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"We went yesterday around 3 pm it was no one there. Waitress was kind friendly food was great but feel little bit over priced but I enjoy the lunch."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burger place by far. I live in CA and every time I'm in Vegas, this is a must stop. There's usually a wait here just because of popularity but who can blame such an amazing place. Unfortunately this is one of two locations. They need to expand! Burgers are awesome, my personal favorite is the ronin. If you want to try fish, go ahead. I've had it before and it was heaven. Any type of fries is a must. I just love everything about this place. They need to open one up in ORange County already. I want to come back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried out this place when it first open.  I have to say, I am glad I waited awhile before I posted a review.  The first couple of times we went into the establishment we had horrible service.  Our first visit had us had us waiting over 45 minutes just to be asked what we wanted to drink!  My wife and I both felt it would be unfair to judge the place bast on customer service and not have tried their food, and I am glad we did.  The service had greatly improved ,and their burgers are excellent.  I have tried almost every burger on the menu without a negative experience.  Their sweet potato fries and truffle fires are amazing. Their sake is also very good and served in some rather interesting carafe styles..  The one down side to this place is that it can be expensive, and everything is A LA carte.  All in all this place is a good place for my wife and I do go with friends to have a good atmosphere and excellent food."}
{"text":"After having to fast and visit the cardiologist I was starving this morning so we waited around for Bachi to open. This is my first time trying here and I am already hooked. They make a mean burger. The staff here is so laid back and so is the restaurant. On this soon to be 100 degree day the music here transforms the customer to an island type vibe. It is way chilled burgers and cocktails. It is way to early for cocktails for me yet. 

I ordered the bottomless matcha green tea iced and at 4.50 that is such a great deal. On the servers advice I tried the pickled veggies and the garlic that is pickled is the best. The burgers that I ordered were the angus burgers but added bacon to them both. One of the burgers at blue cheese and the other had Swiss. The burger seems to melt in your mouth. They are really large too. I have found my new go to burger place."}
{"text":"I had the Angus burger and asked for it well done and it was, but still juicy and nicely charred and seasoned. With avocado, it was 3 inches tall and the bun was fast-food caliber, so no way of eating, other than dismantling and using cutlery.
My complaints don't pertain to the food. The space is enclosed in plain, smoked glass curtain walls, with no ornamentation, nor architectural features. The entrance is double doors even with the wall and with a tiny sign, so no indication at all of up-scale dining. Walking up, the tinted glass almost obscured any view to inside and I thought for a moment that it might be closed! The impression is that this location for this small chain was opened at minimum cost with the expectation that the chain's rep would ensure success.
My other gripe is that the table was wet from wiping down and the seat of the banquette seemed damp as well. The person that seated us had no intention of drying off the table when I mentioned it, but offered us the option of sliding down to the next table."}
{"text":"Five stars when I can't complain. I came to this location with a big group and left happy. Usually the newer locations to restaurants have a hard time competing with the original spots reputation but I prefer this location to the Windmill one. Our waitress was awesome and handled the group well.

So Bachi Burger does a lot of Asian inspired foods: wings, burgers, fries. I love the concept but have never really been a fan. I think the unique ideas never really translated to a good tasting burger and I normally only go because everyone else wants to. 

I had a pitcher of sangria, oxtail fries, regular fries, and the banh mi burger. My food was just awesome. The white sangria was delicious. The oxtail fries were topped well. The banh mi burger is delicious. 

Maybe it was the sangria, maybe it was the server, maybe it was the joyous birthday celebration, but I had an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I always get the Miyagi-San burger and truffle fries, but the porcini sauce on the fries never seems to be enough and I always have to ask for extra sauce which isn't free. I've also tried their ramen but have just decided to stick with their burgers. I really don't like paying almost 14 bucks for a burger but this is truly worth it and can't eat a regular burger anymore."}
{"text":"This place is a truly unique experience!

First of all you have to try the Pineapple Tea. If you go and do not try this beverage you're soul will forever be missing a piece.

Next, the burgers are a pleasant mix of barbecue flavor and tender juicy beef patty. Not only are they super delicious but they are also very decent sized. They do come a la carte so I ordered a side of edamame and can I just tell you how satisfying it was to order and enjoy a great plate of edamame at a burger joint?

So much yes."}
{"text":"First restaurant stop during my most recent visit through the Las Vegas area. Plenty of lot parking for this place that has been featured on DDD. Fairly close to airport.

We were greeted and seated shortly upon entering. Food and beverage orders for the five of us was taken relatively timely. Food delivery, refills, and check settlement were decent with time from Anna. 

Between the five of us we ordered the oxtail chili fries, pork belly steamed bao sandwich, ronin burger, lonely bird and miyagi san burger. Burgers are cooked to the temperate requested. For our table from medium rare to medium.

Oxtail fries reminded us of chili cheese fries substituted ground beef with oxtail. It was not over saucy, balance of sweet and savory.
 
Pork belly steamed bun sandwiches. The duroc pork belly, slaw, egg, and hoisin bbq sauce. Smaller dishes. Tender pork belly. Not as fatty as I like. Not overly sauce. The blend of ingredients sound odd but worked. 

Ronin burger filled with beef?, sweet onion marmalade?, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and a side of yuzu citrus aioli. The onion marmalade gave a good sweetness balance to the savory texture of slaw and egg. The citrus aioli was one of the better sauces we tried between the dishes. Elements separated were all good. Aspects of the dish together were harmonious. 

The lonely bird burger made of ground chicken & turkey \"tsukune\" burger with herb pesto?, lettuce?, tomato, and brown ale battered onion rings. One of the non beef burgers. Plenty of produce. Large stack of onion rings. The chicken turkey blend was not bad. I was not particular fan of it. It was moist but I wasn't feeling it. 

Miyagi San burger made of wagyu beef?, chili mayo?, fried egg?, furikake caramelized bacon?, and crispy onion rings. This was a nice burger. Meat was seasoned, juicy. Got the Asian fusion vibe. The accompaniments were crispy and sweet from the bacon and the onion rings. The sauce was okay.

Overall good experience. Asian fusion written all over. Would visit again."}
{"text":"We tried the Ronin burger, Miyagi San burger, oxtail fries, Parmesan Fries, and kurobuta sausages. Between four of us, we all tasted the different foods and they were all good. Our server, Daniel was very attentive and explained the difference in the different tasting burgers. The topping to end our meal was a Peanut butter and Chocolate Shake with four straws. Awesome.."}
{"text":"Best burgers around. Wish they brought back the Lychee Shakes. They were awesome but have been taken off the menu for some reason. The burgers are so big you will have to cut them in half to get your mouth around a bite."}
{"text":"5 Stars... Stopped by while in Vegas based on the high reviews and had the Mr Miyagi and it was excellent. Sweet potato fries came with a killer sauce with wasabi in it. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype - Bachi Burger is really good! Not only are the burgers really good, but the toppings and flavors are all really interesting and exotic. They have standard cheeseburgers as well, for those who don't want to branch out, but for anyone interested, they have burgers with all kinds of different Asian toppings (slaw, kimchee chi, different cheeses and bacons, lots of mushrooms, sauces, etc). Even for specialty burgers, the price is pretty good, unless you get up into the really fancy stuff (wagyu, crab, foie gras, etc). 
My husband and I went and got one 'normal' specialty burger (I can't remember the name - Ronin maybe? It's the first one on the menu) and one of the more extreme (blue & green or something like that), an order of truffle fries, and one beer. Both burgers were REALLY GOOD, but I preferred the Ronin. The bacon on the other one was just a little too overpowering for me. Truffle fries were excellent as well. The whole thing cost $40 with tip and we had plenty of leftovers (not that you could save them long - the burgers are so loaded with sauces & wet toppings that they're soggy in an hour). 
There was a decent-sized crowd in there on a Friday night, service was very prompt and friendly, and I love that it's near my neighborhood. MOST IMPORTANTLY - Bachi Burger is unlike anything else in the area! I love a great, new, unique, independent restaurant that's NOT on the strip! 
Really, the review is only 4.5 stars because of one thing - the decor/ambiance inside the restaurant. It's kinda bland and the lights seem to be too bright, but because of everything else, I'm rounding up to 5. 
I wish Bachi Burger all the success in the world so they can become longtime residents in the area and maybe inspire some other unique independent places!"}
{"text":"It has been a couple years since I've been here. I have always loved the food and the atmosphere. UNFORTUNATELY, this time was not so pleasant. It all had to deal with the service. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. The guy who eventually did, was not pleasant or polite. Finally sat down after another 7 minutes. They didn't have ramen. And they weren't even busy. Had a question about the menu, they don't allow substitutions on the burgers. (Which I can kind of understand). But by then, I'd had enough. DIDNT EVEN EAT. sad to say, but I don't see myself coming to my \"once favorite burger spot\" anymore.  There was however one nice woman... so it wasn't all terrible...?"}
{"text":"Tell me where you can get a burger and ramen at the same time?  Zippy's? no you lolo, Zippy's has saimin, not ramen!  lol 

If you're a fan of either a burger or ramen, come here.  If you're a fan of both, bring extra money lol. You could feed yourself in appetizers alone, but the Ramen and Burgers are something extra special here. Come hungry and don't be afraid to explore the menu, everything is onolicious."}
{"text":"I probably come here once a month for the ultimate cheat meal! I love the Kalbi Burger and the Spicy Miso Burger. Along with a side of truffle fries. When we feel daring, my love and I share an order of the oxtail fries for an appetizer. I always ask for an extra side of sundried tomato aioli sauce to spread a little on my burger. I remember the first time I ate here, I literally had a food-gasm. Hence my monthly cravings for bachi"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I highly recommend. 
Love the fries and the dips they use mmm
Place is has a nice ambience to it and service is great."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy BachI Burger. I have been here about four times now, and they do not disappoint. Now that they have combined with Shoku Ramen, I enjoy it even more. 

One of my favorites is the spicy miso ramen.  It's done extremely well, but it's not all that spicy, so if you are looking for something extremely spicy, this is not going to satisfy that craving. However, I do have a very high tolerance for spicy food, so it's worth noting that I might not think it's spicy, but it might be spicy for others. The serving size is on par with most other ramen joints.

As for burgers, my favorite is the Kiki Burger. It is filled with hearty mushrooms and the flavor combination is amazing. No complaints here. The burger is huge and done right. 

The truffle garlic fries are also one of my favorites. It's a wonderful combination and I have to get it every single time...even if it's with my ramen. 

The service is good here and it has a hipster vibe...I'll leave value judgements about the atmosphere up to the individual, but it's a fun vibe. Overall, always extremely impressed and enjoy them very much. 

The only caveat to all of this is how busy they can get, and deservingly so.  The wait has stopped me from eating here a few times, but if you try to get here during down times it's not too bad. If it's a rush hour though, be prepared to wait. My latest time eating here was this past Thursday night around 6:00 pm and there was no wait at all."}
{"text":"I had originally heard about this place from the food networks 'Diners,Drive-ins and Dives' tv show. This place was a bit out of the way on our trip to vegas but it was worth it. The service was really great and we were a group of 6 so they gave a lot of good menu suggestions. We all ordered something different (not on purpose) and we were all satisfied when we left. I ordered the shogun burger which was really good and was extremely filling on its own. I shared the truffle fries with a friend just to see what they tasted like and i was not disappointed, i recommend them. Overall a great dining experience and DDD was right again."}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing find! Driving from LA to Vegas and needing a quick gourmet dinner! Best burger I've had all year!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer for the past 4 years and been there about 100 times, brought friends and family. When I ordered a 7up with a splash of beer , the answer was \" NO\" it is against our policy. Since I insisted because I always had the same drink for many years  without a problem, the Manager decide to call security to escort me out of the restaurant. I LMOA and went next door, where I received excellent customer service ( and my drink). Sorry but you just lost my business over a 5 cents splash of Beer and a bad manager decision.
FYI: The customer is not always right, but he still a customer -:)  GL Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger been creating quite a buzz within the Yelp community and I can totally see why.  They have a creative yet solid menu at a very affordable price.  

Friends and I stopped by tonight and tried their Ronin, Kalbi, and Banh Mi Burgers.  Each burgers were well executed with Kalbi Burger being our favorite which by the way was Korean approved by a Kimchi friend in our party :D

The Ronin Burger came with fried egg, coleslaw?, and a horseradish aioli that was quite addicting. The Banh Mi Burger was pretty much a burger with the pickled carrots and daikons and lettuce served with nuoc mam (fish sauce). All burgers came with an Asian sweet bun which isn't so starchy, so primarily focusing on the protein.  yARrrrr ;D

Thanks to Tomoko M.'s recommendation we got an order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries and couldn't be more delighted.  The sun dried tomato aioli that came with it had a nice touch, but our server, Kelsey, brought out a pineapple ketchup for us which completely sealed the deal.  I seriously can't stand pineapple, but man did i want to take that baby home. 

We got the Donuts and Pop Tart for dessert.  I felt the Portuguese donuts got robbed from the spotlight since the Mocha Ice Cream it came with was quite strong on the palate.
I can't really give a proper opinion of the Pop Tart since my North Korean Commie friend took the entire White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato in one bite leaving me with just the heavy port wine cherry flavor and the Pop Tart.  aRrrr ;(

The whole meal was a bit heavy, but well worth it.  Going to come back with reinforcement to try the other stuff.

Verdict: If you love Slidin' Thru, you'll defiantly love Bachi Burgers.
Open til 2am!"}
{"text":"Slowly sliding down too bad the food really has potential!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever eaten in my life is the Shogun burger. I think that says a lot for anyone who has eating many burgers in their time living in the USA. This thing was mind blowing. All I have to say is if you have doubts of spending $26 on a burger you will quickly feel like you just got the best deal ever.

The Shogun burger consists of Wagyu beef burger topped with foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter. AMAZING!

The only negative is we ordered two burgers, the Shogun and the Kiki, and made the mistake and ate the Shogun first. The Kiki was just normal after eating that full flavored Shogun. So if you want to try something else while sharing make sure to try the Shogun last.

The pork belly buns and the garlic edamame were also really good. Good eats!"}
{"text":"After reading numerous reviews on Yelp about Bachi Burger I was finally in the area around lunch time so I stopped in for a to-go order. The reviews on Yelp made it clear that Bachi Burger had two areas they could improve in: Service and speed. Since I was on my lunch break I didn't have all day to wait for my order, so I asked how long it would take before I even looked at the menu. 10-15 minutes is what I was told by a pretty friendly employee.

I decided to get Kiki's Burger, sweet potato fries and a cantaloupe milk tea with boba... Total was a little under $20, isn't Micky D's that's for damn sure! 

My drink was made immediately and it was so tasty, my first cantaloupe milk tea definitely will not be my last! My food really did take 10-15 minutes. No complaints at all on the service, I was treated respectfully and they got me on my way pretty quickly.

Kiki's Burger comes with cheese, two types of mushrooms, bacon, an onion marmalade that was nice and sweet and a sauce on the side that I did not bother with. It was cooked perfectly, medium as I was told they recommended it. What a great combination of flavors! I would absolutely order this again. 

The real standout was the sweet potato fries though. I shared some with my co-worker because I know how much she likes sweet potato fries and she told me that these were \"Off the hook, best she ever had\". I agree with her. 

So I'm not sure about some of these negative reviews. Has Bachi Burger stepped their game up in recent months? Did I happen to go at the right day and time? Or were people just too critical? Not sure, I think I will need to go back to Bachi Burger again to find out."}
{"text":"I use to live a few blocks from here and when it came to burgers, I had choices from the strip, In-N-Out, and Steiner's.  I wasn't aware of Yelp at the time, so I took the advice from a friend to eat at Bachi and became a fan ever since.

One thing about Bachi is the presentation.  Bachi goes out of the way to make a burger look so beautiful.  I have to admit that I've been here 5+ times and the Sahara location 10+ times in the last 2 years and have yet to try any of their actual burgers. I know, what's wrong with me right?  I guess it's because I love their Bachi Fish (Alaskan Cod), the Lonely Bird (Chicken/Turkey), the Oxtail Fries, and their Bachi Dog.  All are good, very rich due to their sauces, flavorful, and a little messy.  Out of everything I've tried here, their Bachi Fish has to be my favorite.

Couple of side notes about Bachi in general.  Sometimes there's a wait to get your order and served.  Because of this, I rarely hit up Bachi on a weekend.  The Sahara location is bigger and faster in my opinion.  Also, the burgers are little pricey (most over $10). 

Overall, I am still giving Bachi 5 Stars even though I have not tried any of their actual burgers.  Based on the other reviews, they're good so don't let my review discourage you from trying them. However, allow my review to encourage you to try the Bachi Fish.  Both restaurants are clean, service always great, and I have never been disappointed with a Bachi visit."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers...I did it. I finally had a burger from Bachi.  A bunch of you guys have given me a hard time about this (Terri and Gigi to name a few).  I've been to both Bachi's out here a combined 15+ times and have never had their burgers.  To me, it's all about the Bachi Fish baby.  

Because I was giving up red meat for the next 6 weeks, it was perfect to attend Terri R's Fat Tuesday UYE at Bachi.  A few other Elite Yelpers were in attendance along with new Yelpers that are elite in life. Everyone ordered a burger and when it came to me, I was so close to getting their Alaskan Cod Sandwich.  But because it's Bachi and I won't taste red meat for awhile, I got their Black and Green Burger which is their Wagyu with mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and blue cheese.  The burger itself was good and I have no regrets.  However, I thought that the blue cheese was way overpowering.  If I could rename this burger, it be the Black and Blue Burger.  

Overall, I had an great meal and excellent time meeting some new Yelpers.  

Bachi UYE Roll Call (Message from Mel C):

Nelson S:  Nice to meet you, let's go on a hike.  Remember this week's 5K is a walking event, not a running event. 

Chad S:  Everyone was right.  You're too cool and glad I've finally met you. See you at your UYE later this week.  

Susan K and Noah R:  Again, congratulations on your engagement.  Some of the best peeps you can ever meet. Yes, I know this just from one night. 

Francisco A (aka Cisco):  Another great elite to meet.  Another rhyme every time. He's the check in king that has the ability to check in from anywhere.  All you Dukes and Duchesses watch out.  He's a check in eater.  Watch out boy, watch out boy. 

Terri R:  Thanks for putting this together.  Meeting your friends was definitely the highlight of the evening.  Another good meal with a great friend.  Bookmark checked!!!

Peace out and stay thirsty my friends."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, but the service is a bit slow on a slow late afterb. And why would the waiter give you a glass of iced water immediately as soon as you are seated?  Anyhow, overall great burgers but service would need a bit of an improvement.  I'll still come back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BURGERS! I love the bun the use soft and fluffy. I made sure to come just when they opened, so there was no wait time. Although when i finished and left, there was a huge crowd outside waiting to be seated.


Miyagi-san Burger; Amazing burger! perfect combination of Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings. Has a unique Japanese taste. Reminds me of eating specialty rolls at sushi places.

Kiki's Burger: Perfect combination of mushroom that gives the burger a unique taste. Hard to decide whether i like this more or the Miyagi burger. I would say if you want something less guilty... get this one! It was great, but not too heavy.

Truffle Parmesan Fries - Unique taste I would get this again. Prefer this over the Oxtail Chili cheese fries

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- Pretty interesting to try once, but i would skip this and try an extra burger next time!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner there tonight- showed up at about 5:30pm, not too crowded for a sat night, no wait necessary.  My BF and I sat down, ordered the chili/garlic edemame, he had the Mata green tea and I had the apple/lychee soda.  My soda was yummy! My BF wanted sweet n'low for his tea but they didn't have any.  So our waitress gave us sugar, which doesn't work cause it wont dissolve and sinks right to the bottom..oh well.

Anyways- our friends finally get in and I order the duck steamed buns, my BF orders the KIKI burger and our friends get the Blue/Green burger and the Crab burger.  We also order sweet potato fries, garlic salt pepper fries, Parmesan truffle fries and shrimp chips. 

My duck steamed buns were delish- wish they would offer a combo of all the steamed buns in one dish, that way someone  like myself that likes variety can try all three since I love pork belly too!

My BF and friend that ordered the burgers both thoroughly enjoyed theirs, they said the burgers were nice and juicy and were cooked perfectly.  I had a small bite of my BF's Kiki burger and really liked it too (next time!)
I also tried my friend's crab burger and it was okay- the crab cake had a good amount of crab, hardly any fillers so it was quite flaky.

Now- out of all the fries, I actually loved the sweet potato fries the best, the wasabi aioli had a nice kick to it but the sweet potato fries were a thicker cut so you can still get the warm/soft potato bite to it.
The others were just okay and the shrimp chips a little too greasy still.

Overall, a success as we will definitely be back to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"My review is more like 4.75 stars, but I loved this place.  At first glance, this place didn't look like much.  Wow, was I wrong.  The hostess greeted us and we were seated immediately.  This place is small and kind of unpretentious (yay!).  If it were closer to my house, I would go here all the time.  My BF and I met an out-of-town friend here for dinner, as she was shopping at the nearby outlet mall.  Since we don't live that close, we decided to try EVERYTHING.

We started off with the Momato appetizer (Japanese tomatoes with balsamic and fresh cheese).  I think I remember seeing in a review that these weren't worth your time.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  These tomatoes were the perfect flavor without a hint of bitterness.  The ratio of each ingredient was perfect too.  Loved it.  We also had cold edamame beans which were just okay.

My BF ordered the Ronin Burger.  My friend and I ordered the Kiki Burger.  My burger was soooo good.  Cooked perfectly and great flavors.  My BF tried mine and swears his was even better, but since I didn't get a bite before he woofed it down, I wouldn't know.  

As for the fries, we split an order of the Truflle fries and the garlic and salt fries.  I loved the garlic fries, truffle fries weren't my bag, but the other two enjoyed them. 

Somehow, after eating all that food, we decided to order two desserts: strawberry beignets (basically crunchy strawberry filled donuts) and peach poptarts.  Don't bother.   Both desserts were mediocre and definitely the weakest link in this otherwise awesome dinner.  Even though this is out of the way for me, I will definitely be going back.  Our server (whose name has escaped me, mostly because he looked and sounded like Keanu Reeves and even said he was from Hawaii, but I'm sure his name is not Keanu) was great as well.  You could tell he was really trying and was very attentive.  And did I mention the prices????  All that food plus a Sapporo and our bill was $60!!! Beats the heck out of Grind Burger any day, which is VERY overpriced IMO."}
{"text":"Azn fusion burger joint located in S. Summerlin, 7 miles west of the 15 on Sahara.  They offer wagyu beef served on a sweet Taiwanese bun.  The other Azn factor is the hi \"bachi\" which the burgers are cooked upon.  No offense to my yf Lisa S. from Vegas, but this place failed in many ways.  It also received high ratings from other Yelpers, but I was very disappointed.

My friend and I ordered the Black & Green   ($13) and Miyagi ($14) versions.  The B&G has wagyu beef, blue cheese and bacon.  The Miyagi has furikake, fried egg, onion rings and bacon.  We also ordered parmesan truffle fries ($5) and onion rings ($3.50).

First of all, another table received their food before us even though we were seated and ordered before them.  To add insult to injury, I was starving and they ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50 w/ fried egg on top).  This plate looked awesome!  Despite the foregoing, the fries and rings were good when we finally got them.

Both burgers were ho hum - Nothing Special.  The B&G did not have much blue cheese and it was missing bacon on one side.   The Miyagi was just missing - it came out 15 min after my burger (and at the same time as another customer who was seated well after us).  When I asked the Mgr where the Miyagi was, all he said was there was a problem in the kitchen.  The real problem was that my friend's burger was served to another table because I saw Miyagis being served to other tables where the patrons came after us.

The Mgr did try to show us some luv by giving us complimentary Portuguese donuts.  We were eagerly expecting pao doce (sweet bread) or malasadas.  Unfortunately, what we received was fried dough that was the consistency of a cake donut on the inside, w/ the taste of cinnamon from a stale churro on the outside.  One word description:  NASTY!

I would not make the trek from the strip to come again.  The food is nothing special, the prices are high and the service is spotty.  I can get a much better burger and service back home in OC at Umami, 25 Degrees and Haven."}
{"text":"Complete burger mastery here on display.  I'm not sure how to express it any other way.  Truly stunning execution of the Miyagi-San burger. 

Explosive flavor, beautiful plate layout, and a perfectly cooked egg on the burger.  100% perfect dish.  

The salt and pepper garlic fries were outstanding as well. 

I'm stunned as to how good this meal was.

{"text":"Ate here again today for the second time. Due to the weather, both my wife and I ordered a noodle bowl. Both were delicious although very different in terms of spiciness and contents. I had the Spicy Miss bowl and it WAS spicy although not overly so. The wife had a very simple noodle soup that she enjoyed very much.  Service was excellent. Again...we will be back."}
{"text":"My family came here last week and we really love this place. Service was great;however, The ramen noodle was a little bit salty. Other than that everything was great. We definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was just here and ordered an appetizer and waited on the food to come to the table. We literally sat there for 30 min waiting hungry. We finally get checked on and 15 after they come back to let us know that our food somehow got pushed back. They were kind enough to offer something free. I declined and asked to have our food packed so we could leave. Keep in mind the restaurant was getting busy and we were just sitting there, while others could be seated. I didn't realize how pushed back our order was after realizing about 5 other tables received their food. If one of our food orders was going to take longer to cook, it would have been nice to know and I wouldn't be annoyed about all this. Unfortunately this will be my last time coming to this place. I'd rate this with no star but they won't let me. PLEASE REVIEW AND RETRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!!!"}
{"text":"In search of the best burger I stumbled upon Bachi Burger. I was also prepping for a physique competition and this was my last cheat meal for the next 3 months so my expectations were high or let me say my hopes were high!!

We took the bus from the strip and walked close to 2 miles after that. Ok now this better be good! 

Finally we arrive! Located in a newer building complex it didn't look like much. We were seated right away and told about the special of the day, fish tacos! 

I we decided to go for the Miso Burger and the Ronin Burger. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns, fish tacos and sweet potato fries. Our burgers were cooked I perfection and were AMAZING!! One of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were so good I ordered another helping along with another helping of the steam buns. These things are so unique an full of flavor. Reminded me of the pork belly sandwich I got at Burroughs Market in London. 

Now let's talk about the sauces they have for dipping! They have a hoisin sauce for the steam buns which was to die for and also they had a pineapple ketchup that I just wanted to swim in!!! Thy had a few other sauces that were amazing too and all fresh made!!!

For dessert I ordered a chocolate peanutbutter shake. The waitress asked if I like chocolate or peanutbutter more? I said peanutbutter and all I can say is she took note!! So good!!

This place will be an absolute much any time I visit Vegas. Definitely is now another reason I'm excited to return to LV!!!"}
{"text":"The best burgers I've had, yes they are specialty burgers but sometimes you just got to try and if you're looking for a little different this is they place. If you're just out for a regular burger this may not be the one. 
The onion rings are great and the ox tail fries are fantastic. 
Only thing I hold back on is they are pricy and everything is al a cart."}
{"text":"My first time ever coming to this location as I've never heard about it before today but my friend said it was amazing and let me tell you I think I just had the best burger in my life and I've eaten a lot of burgers.

Annna was my server and she was so friendly and helpful it possibly even could be love at first sight .

The atmosphere and music are very welcoming.  The place was spotless.   It's definitely not a typical burger joint.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I HATE to complain but, under new management? 

My boyfriend and I came here last night, Friday April 12th. Bachi burger used to be one of our favorite restaurants, until last night, and we would come here at least once a month. We became dedicated customers since the first Bachi that opened on Windmill. We were so stoked one opened near us. 
I was being quite observant last night because the change was that noticeable. The usual atmosphere of Bachi Burger is now different and uncomfortable. 
I almost wanted to leave because it was freezing inside. My boyfriend and I sat down and the vibe of the place was completely off. The lights were extremely bright. The feel of intimacy was no longer there, which makes it a horrible place for a date night. The music was no longer smooth, jazzy electronic music, which gave it that Asian fusion vibe. Wasn't that the whole concept of Bachi? You could barely hear Frank Sinatra playing in the background as the blenders and customers conversations were actually louder than the music. It also seemed like they were short on waiters/waitresses, no greeting hostess,  and everyone in the kitchen looked confused. Our food arrived quickly, but it wasn't AS great as usual. My medium well was more medium RARE and slightly chewy, I couldn't even finish it. I was so hungry. :( 

My experience this time was different. I hope Bachi gets it together... The food is such a delicious concept to give up on all because they can't run a stabilize business."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings - for one, the staff were awesome and let our party of four in just 10 minutes before closing. Thank you for that - it's not always easy to find a place to cater to four different tastes!

LOVED the handmade sodas - cherry yuzu is insanely refreshing, could not get enough. Sides are so-so, the jalapeno slices in the salt and pepper fries are kind of awkward to eat. The chili chicken was amazing, according to a tablemate. 

For the burgers, reactions ranged from \"incredible\" to \"okay\" to \"not for me.\" I feel like some of the burgers have a bit too much of everything going on. I love the idea of a taro bun, but in reality, maybe not needed on a burger with five other flavors. I got the kalbi burger and was in heaven. It's a messy joint, but totally delicious. Probably the most satisfied diner at our table. 

In retrospect, perhaps not that high on my list of places to return to, but it was there when we needed it. If you are an adventurous eater with a taste for Japanese flavors, you will likely love it, but if you are just a burger and fries kind of person, you may want to stay away or just keep it simple."}
{"text":"I love this place! The burgers are so inventive and delicious. The fries are excellent as well. The other places don't even compare. If you want a great burger with a new twist you have to eat here.

The only draw back is that they are so fat away, but they are in the process of a Summerlin location that is a few blocks away from me. As soon as it opens Bachi Burger will be a weekly stop!"}
{"text":"Its been SIX years since my last visit where i said i wouldn't return, and STILL Bachi manages to fark up the service portion of my meal. 

So disappointing. I brought my Grandma/pa so that he can eat a burger and my Asian grandmother can have ramen (perfect, or so i thought). Ordered, ramen for her, a burger for me and pops, 2 fries, and a milk shake. Ramen comes out in normal 12-14 minute time frame. Milkshake comes out next 8-10 minutes later. 15-18 minutes from there (yes, over a half hour and 70% through her ramen our burgers come out. And how about another 10 minutes for our fries when i was taking my last 2 bites of my burger. What the hell?! No updates from the waitress, no apology or even explanation for the delays or for our meal coming out deconstructed. We asked for no lettuce on one of the burgers and it still came out with it on. I simply do not understand! Its simple... other restaurants can handle a simple burger with NO LETTUCE, why cant you? You did it six years ago when we asked for no onions. AMAZING! 

People make the comment that it takes time to make a good burger. I may be ok with that if you can at least bring out the meal so we can eat TOGETHER. And maybe get the order correct at LEAST. Part of the dining experience is service, and Bachi fails at this and has not attempted to remedy it since they opened years ago."}
{"text":"Parents... take your kids to McDonald's ... let the adults enjoy a nice burger experience.


The place was very busy... we waited 30-35 minutes.. not a big deal. We expected it to be popular since it was on Triple D. 

Our server was very nice and accommodating.  The atmosphere was a little loud but not obnoxious. The table full of kids next to us was annoying... SMH! 

Food...   the burgers were very flavorful and we really enjoyed the fries. Both were cooked as we requested and all in all.. it was a nice experience.

I would recommend this place to others. Well worth a visit if you want to enjoy a great burger with a variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in the area I'll definitely be coming here , the food & beer was extremely good and our bartender/waitress was the best"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this place.  I'm not normally a burger person but this is sooooo good that I forget they are burgers!"}
{"text":"First off, I typically like my dishes \"traditional\". For example, if I'm going out for a burger and fries, I want a wholesome American burger and fries, authentic Chinese food, etc. With that said, I'm not usually a fan of fusion restaurants, but this place combines flavors so well - I can't deny the great taste of their burgers!

My favorite from here is the Miyagi-sun burger. It has a great mix of delicious fillings, with the crispy onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and the furikake seasoning. The patty is thick and tastes of high-quality meat. There seems to be some like BBQ sauce (or maybe it's just the caramelized bacon) that makes the burger a little sweet. The onion rings cause the burger to be stacked pretty high but don't be afraid to squish everything together and get your hands a little dirty :P The burger tastes amazing with the combination of the different textures of the fillings and it's awesome to get a little bit of everything in each bite! The buns are nice and soft too (that's what he said? Haha). My bf and I also shared an order of the salt, pepper and garlic fries.. The metal cone they are served in is deceiving as it is not entirely filled with fries (stops about halfway through). Nonetheless one order of fries was perfect to be shared between the two of us. The garlic chili aioli it came with was also good, not spicy at all. 

The wait was a little longer than I would have expected for our dishes, especially since it didn't seem particularly busy when we came by. We dropped in around 3pm on a Friday and there was no wait to be seated. I've also come with a bigger group and they do seem to seat parties pretty quickly. Parking is decent since it shares a bigger lot with the rest of the stores in the plaza. Service was nice and polite. 

Definitely worth stopping by for a delicious and unique burger if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our first (of many) visits to Bachi Burger. Francesca was our server. She was bright funny and well-informed. She took very good care of us and helped steer us toward excellent choices from the menu and bar. The cucumber lemonade was AMAZING!! 10x better than expected. The Mr.Ho and the Krusty Burger were great. But the best part of our meal was the STEAMED PORK BELLY BUNS. JUST WOW. Dessert was Bananas Foster Bread Pudding. Two meals plus a slight upgrade. One appetizer. Four cocktails and dessert. Under $100."}
{"text":"Would be really nice if we received silverware to enjoy your meal with, rather than eating out of a tin can. Seems like everyone after I came in is getting served better than me. Perhaps because I'm the only tan one here..."}
{"text":"Great Vegas burger joint just outside the strip.. Burgers have an Asian twist so makes for different & interesting condiments.. I had the burger with the egg and bacon on it.. Can't remember the name but it was off the hook.. Meat was high quality, buns are freshly baked and the condiment choices were all fresh and tastey.. Steamed pork dim sum sliders!! Need I say more.. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"i love that it is open till 2.00 am and the burgers here the best in town"}
{"text":"Ate dinner last night here and today back for the shogun burger at lunch. $30 is underpriced for the deliciousness of this foie gras unagi gem.   Salt n pepper fries w jalapeño n Szechuan pepper are thumbs up too. Doubt you could go wrong w anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Why eat here when you can have a steak dinner for less?  Holy high prices, Batman!  

Lunch specials start at $19 and go up from there and I didn't feel like taking out a loan for a burger lunch

I ordered a la cart the regular 7oz Bachi Burger that only comes with lettuce, onion and tomato (no cheese) for lunch because it was only $8 (hear anything special so far for $8?) plus I had truffle fries for $4.50. Ok so now you all know I am cheap, on to the food -

The burger was cooked very well but simply nothing at all was on it except those three items. It was comparable to any other burger I have purchased. Now, they had burgers with all sorts of exotic ingredients available but those were too pricey for me ($12-$16 range).  The fries were good but you could get some just as good at Smashburger in my humble opinion. 

I don't mind paying good money for value. Maybe I'm not \"chichi\" enough for this place?  I definitely think value is overestimated here with the prices and have trouble because I could have eaten a steak at Outback down the street for less and been more satisfied.  We all know that's nothing to brag about and neither is this place."}
{"text":"I had seen this place on either the Food Channel, or the Travel Channel.  I decided on a trip to Vegas visiting family to check it out.  

I brought a group of 9 people on a Saturday at lunch time.  I was very surprised that the place was nearly empty.  It gave me the feeling of \"oops, I made a mistake going there\".  But to my surprise, the food and service was awesome.

I had a Mr. Miagi burger and a Guava Strawberry shake.  Amazing stuff!!!

I would go back in a heartbeat to check out their other burgers."}
{"text":"My husband had the Bahn-Mi burger. It was delicious. We shared the truffle parmesan fries (sauce on the side) and they were delicious. I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns which were okay. I wanted to substitute one of the three buns for a duck breast steamed bun but the waitress wouldn't let me. I was surprised that she wouldn't accommodate my request even though I was willing to pay extra. 

I highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you love burgers and you love Asian cuisine, you'll love this place. And I bet you won't find a better burger anywhere this far off the strip. Get the Ronin for your first burger, and the oxtail chili fries.

It gets pretty busy on weekends, which is expected for high-rated dining, however it seems they're understaffed at times - the only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I had watched an episode about Bachi Burger a year ago and I knew if I was in Vegas, I would have to try it! I was not disappointed! I am never one to finish a burger but it was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had! Their oxtail fries were amazing! Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Great place! Super enjoy the food. The oxtail chili cheese fries are soooooo good! The black and green burger is my fave because I adore bleu cheese and I absolutely love the pineapple ketchup!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and liked the burgers both times. There is a teriyaki-like flavor in the meat but it doesn't overwhelmed the toppings and sauces that comes with it. 

The only drawback is the speed of the food. The servers were generally prompt in taking the order, but it took the food a while to come out. One time the restaurant was busy and second time not. 

I would come back but I would need to plan for more time to eat and not come starving so I don't get irritated by the wait."}
{"text":"First impressions: with a group of traveling coworkers the three check per table maximum suggested we couldn't eat here since we all needed separate checks. When we said we had to go, the server said he could accommodate. In the bathroom the hot water didn't work. Toilet didn't flush. Unimpressed up front.

The burger and fries were good but for my $20 I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Eh...its not your typical burger....purina yuppie chow!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place in June when I came to visit Vegas for a weekend of fun. I was embarking into an awesome food traveling that time around, since all the times I went to Vegas, all I did was party. I found out about this place through Diners, Drive-ins &Dives. Yes, I can watch that all day long. Dont judge. Im a fatty :) Anyway, enough with the intro...

Wait was about an hour. It was PACKED. I was guessing it was THAT good, that every Las Vegas partier came here for hangover cure. It was a pain in the butt having to wait outside knowing that it was 1000 degrees outside. Waiting area of the restaurant was tiny, but I managed to squeezed in.

Food: Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- My yelper people were absolutely right about this one. YUM YUM YUM YUM! I would order it again in a heart beat. It was meaty, fries were crispy &flavorful.

Pork Buns: It was like the asian tacos. Sweet pork flavor, in a soft fluffy white asian buns. Delicious! 

Shogun Burger- Had foie gras, unagi &wagyu beef. This burger was okay, but definitely NOT worth $26. Maybe it was because I am not a big fan of foie gras(duck liver), because of the gamey taste, &the burger is a little on the sweeter side. Unagi made the burger a little fishy, but the wagyu beef was good. 

Banh Mi Burger- Awesome rendition of the Bahn Mi Sandwich. I definitely recommend.

Service: It was okay. Waitress couldve been a lil more friendly, but she was preggers from what I remember so I understand that her job could probably be a lil stressful. 

I cannot wait to travel back to Vegas &try other dishes at this place."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something-I would rather come to bachi burger, sit in a restaurant that I know doesn't change locations and will be open than chase around a truck so I can sit in a parking lot waiting for my overpriced food for an hour. 

Ok, so about the food. It's delicious. I had the ronin burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was nice and juicy and flavorful, like amazing flavor. The fries were so good. If you've never had sweet potato fries, over them. I would say they are borderline dessertish with a nice salty sweet mixture of flavors. Btw Lantz the server is awesome. Good attitude and really good with explaining everything and making suggestions."}

TASTE:  HELL YEA!
Kiki's Burger ... one hell of a bad boy, a large burger sportin an eartty mushroom taste like an ugly redheaded stepchild at an Irish fair. This was one great burger! A true 5*****Star 

Oxtail Chili Fries ... I've had oxtail spaghetti ragu, soup, pho and even a Jamacian oxtail jerk, but never had it as a chili base before. Its marrow/ gelatin rich flavor is an awesome boot in the pants to an otherwise plain beef chile. I reccomend this for anyone going to Vegas.. It kicks tail!

SERVICE:   here is off the hook, you know they got a good thing going and make sure you do too. Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.

I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.

I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!"}
{"text":"I have such a wonderful friend that lives in Las Vegas, knowing that I was traveling alone (not uncommon for me), she brought me some food from Bachi Burger.  Although I don't mind eating alone in a restaurant, it's always more fun eating with a friend.

I had the Kalbi Burger, which consists of: Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee and Ko Chu Jang Mayo.  Got all that?  If you're from Hawaii, you probably didn't even bat an eye when I mentioned all those things because you knew exactly what I'm talking about.  But if you're not used to Korean food, you're probably scribbling frantically to go and Google the words you don't know, right?  OK, so go Google and come back.  I'll wait for you here.  *pause*

Now that you know what all the ingredients are, here's my review.  Oh wait, let me give you my disclaimer first.  I'm not a huge burger fan.  Your occasional Mickey Dee's or grilled poolside burgers are great.  But I'm not a burger seeker outer.  With that said, this burger was magically delicious!  Not in the Lucky Charms kind of way but in the it's-so-non-typical-it's-almost-like-eating-a-plate-lunch-with-bread-instead-of-rice kind of way.  (Plate lunch:  A mixture of different food items, laid out on one plate and usually includes rice, macaroni salad - did you know that Hawaii has the highest per capita of people that have diabetes?  Now you know why.  We eat starch with our starch and then put more starch on top)  Where was I?  Oh yeah, it's like a mini plate lunch but in sandwich format.  The beef was delicious, the sauce was good and the sweet potato fries gave it a nice compliment.  All I needed to go with it was a Korean bar lady saying, \"Buy me drinky?\" and I would've had the full experience.  

If you're open to trying new types of burgers, this is the place to get one from.  ^_^"}
{"text":"Burgers were top-notch.  The fries with truffle oil were awesome too.  Also tried their ramen, however, wasn't too impressed.  Stick to the burgers!

Oh and there is ALWAYS a wait..."}
{"text":"Thank you for making some out there burgers!!!  We learned of this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and have wanted to go for some time.  We had hours to kill before our plane home so we planned to end our day here and it was a great last meal in Vegas.  Hubby had the bahn mi burger and it was tasty!  I had the miyagi San burger and it was pretty darned good too.  The side of fries were great - crispy and seasoned slightly."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to bachi burger and all I can say is... DELICIOUS! I came back because the first time i was unable to try the oxtail chili cheese fries, I'm glad I came back to try them because they were the best chili cheese fries I have ever tasted. When arriving the wait time was at 30-40 mins. but me and my girlfriend were starving so we opted to sit at the bar counter. I ordered the miyagi-San burger while my girlfriend ordered the pork belly steamed buns. No complaints what so ever and I can't wait till the next time I'm in Vegas so I can get my hands on another one of bachi burgers delicious eats!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place when I was watching Diner, Drive-In, and Dives... It looked so good on TV, so as soon as I arrived to Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon I went straight here. I arrived around 2:00-2:30 and the host told me it was about a 30 minutes wait.  What I wish she would have told me was the bar is open seating, so people that walked in after me sat down first.  When I was finally sat, they place me in a secondary room by the kitchen which was empty, so I did not understand the long wait time.   

The staff was all very nice and polite.

The food was amazing!!!  My wife had The Lonely Bird which she loved.  I had the The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger which was also amazing.  We both shared the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Pork Belly Steamed Buns.

I am from Orange County and the closes to me is in L.A. which is a little too far, but next time I am near another location I am defiantly returning."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, unique, and delish! Cant go wrong!! Try the Bachi Fish and make your taste buds happy!!

Note, both restaurants can get really busy during normal lunch/dinner times, plan enough time."}
{"text":"BEST. FISH. BURGER. EVER! No joke, Bachi Fish burger is the best fish burger of my life. The fries with mushroom gravy and parm with a tomato aoli shouldn't be missed either.

Note to you red meat eaters, my husband said quote \"I should have ordered your fish burger over my beef, its waaayyyy better\". Try it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This location is as amazing as the others! Come here, order the calamari, the truffle parm fries, and the fish sandwich and send me thanks after your taste buds do a little dance! Really, this place is one of our favorite stops in town!

Note, this location (I cant say if the others are the same) has a great happy hour special til 6pm (I think) and its a nice discount on apps (hello, truffle parm fries!!) and some adult bevs.  Not sure of the exact dates/times of happy hour, but I know they got it, and you are gonna want it!"}
{"text":"It's been almost two years and too many visits. Just kidding, you can't make too many visits here. Anyway, time for an update!

Bachi Burger is a fantastic burger place that I always recommend to friends and family, locals and visitors alike. The specialty burgers are obviously what you want to get, but don't turn a blind eye to appetizers and fries.

I've enjoyed the kurobuta and aribaki sausage w/ honey mustard, chili fried chicken, oxtail chili cheese fries, and the sweet potato fries before. However, my favorite side is definitely the truffle parmesan fries with parmigiano reggiano, white truffle oil (shut up, I know it's not real truffle), porcini cream, and sundried tomato aioli. I don't tend to have it while I'm in the middle of a Bachi burger, so I usually try to get them to bring it out earlier than the burgers.

I will detail all the burgers that I've eaten in reverse power rankings style:

7) \"Banh-mi\" Burger. Brownie points for the quotation marks. I always enjoy a good banh mi, but I am not a fan of this burger, and it still saddens me that this is the one that they chose to feature on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The flavors just don't work or harmonize together for some reason, and I always steer people away from this.

6) Mr. Ho's. The highlight is probably lup cheong, a sweet pinkish red pork sausage. The problem is that the overall flavor profile is too sweet and only has that one flavor. Glad I've tried it, glad I'll never have to order it again.

5) Spicy miso. I had this tied with Kiki's before, but I've gotta make a choice. Nothing especially wrong here, and really love the fried egg. Heat seekers, do know that the sauce isn't that spicy, even for someone with a delicate palate like me. If I had a rotation, this would make my rotation.

4) Kiki's. My old second favorite burger. Bacon, lots of mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli. Sweet overall but not too sweet, and a good layering of flavors.

3) Miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu. Relatively simple combination here to accompany the default \"wagyu\" patty. Chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. It's really weird though, since I specifically taking a bite, not enjoying it, then flipping my burger upside down and really loving it. I guess the flavors hit my mouth a lot better that way. Try it both ways and see for yourself.

By the way, I couldn't really distinguish wagyu from the normal angus beef, so you're likely better off not \"upgrading\" any of your other specialty burgers.

2) Manga. My burger from today. This was a special posted on the chalkboard outside. It is a 7 oz patty with sunny side up egg (presented without top bun not layered), sprouts, crab and scallop dynamite, and a side of pickled ginger. Apparently, enoki mushrooms also were in it, but I don't recall. Anyway, if you're a fan of dynamite, you need to eat this. The egg contributes as usual, the dynamite flavor is all there (most tender baby scallops I've ever had, by the way), the beef flavor is always there, and the pickled ginger can add extra sweetness if you so desire. I couldn't decide whether I enjoy it more with or without ginger.

1) Ronin. Still my favorite, although the manga made a really, really strong case. I think the yuzu citrus aioli adds enough acidity that it pushes the Ronin above a very strong field of contenders. Caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, and my beloved fried egg complete the flavor combination.

All burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare. It's cooked, but you still get that nice pinkish center and keep all the juiciness. If you order it well-done, I will personally hunt you down and even haunt your dreams if I must. They have always delivered the right temperature and never gotten me sick, so don't under or over-order.

Some don't believe that it's the best burger in town. I haven't eaten everywhere in Vegas yet, but this is still my favorite place, even in spite of the recent menu-wide price hike. I will also note that some guy who writes a blog solely about Vegas burgers has apparently been almost everywhere, and he's named Bachi as his favorite. You will have to see for yourself, and I hope you manage to go early or late enough to avoid the ubiquitous crowds."}
{"text":"They might not be all-in on the \"Healthy Life\" concept anymore, but they still serve some great breakfast here.

Formerly branded as Bachi HLK and now featuring a prominent Bachi Burger sign on their facade, this location is referred to by the name \"Bachi Kitchen\" on their web site. Whatever it's really called, it's definitely still worthy of bearing the Bachi banner.

Note: I didn't order any burgers here last time because they barely offered any, with most of the offerings oriented toward brunch. I didn't try any burgers this time either. Even though they have their standard burger menu here,  I could just get the burgers (my favorite in town still, by the way) at their original Windmill location. That drive is significantly shorter for me.

They've pared down their breakfast offerings significantly since they first launched, and the detested green tea crepes (more on that if you can dig up my Bachi HLK review somehow) were no longer present. Sadly, the Country Hash was also gone, but they still have some appetizers, pancakes, several egg dishes, and a few kid meals. Presumably they've kept these because they're the best offerings, so I was pretty optimistic.

Well, that positivity was definitely warranted. I started off with the Short Rib Benedict ($15) with hash browns (rather than fingerling potatoes). Disregard all my older reviews - this short rib is actually the best that I have had in town. It was tender, pink inside, and _not_ puzzlingly salt-deficient. That's an issue that I've tasted time and again, but I didn't experience it today. Instead, the taste brought back old but very pleasant memories of savory beef, which I'm surprised that I could've ever forgotten.

That short rib alone makes the dish my favorite eggs benedict yet, but I enjoyed the bearnaise sauce and the perfectly poached eggs too. The hash browns were relatively mundane, though they were certainly crispy, plentiful and well-seasoned, and the greens were lightly dressed and fresh. Actually, the red onions were a little stringy in texture, but I appreciated their flavor contribution.

I also had the Almond Brioche French Toast ($11.50, although the menu said $11), which was quite good as well. The toast was dusted with powdered sugar. While it wasn't too crispy, it definitely wasn't soggy. The raspberry puree, mixed berry compote, and banana were all nice touches. The maple syrup and the thick coconut syrup (served warm for a reason) were a bit annoying to pour from the dispensers, but they both paired well with the dish. The server was nice enough to give me small plastic containers for these sauces (I had leftovers, sadly).

No changes to the decor as far as I could see, with lots of lighter colored woods used for the seats and tables. They also have a bar with plenty of liquor on display, which would not have been the best call for me at 10:30-ish a.m. before a meeting with a prospective employer.

Admittedly, the sample size is smaller, but I feel that this Kitchen is serving food that's at least as good as, if not better than the new breakfast hotspots in Henderson. If you're a fan of Bachi, take the time to try their breakfast concept. If not, we'll have to agree to disagree on their burgers, and try the breakfast menu anyway.

[QUICK UPDATE 4/20/16: Ronin burger and oxtail chili cheese fries were both on point. So yeah, this truly is Bachi Burger but with breakfast.]"}
{"text":"As you can tell by the photos, these are not your average burger. Yes, many places pile all sorts of things on top of a meat patty and declare victory. This is not that. This is the burger equivalent of hanging the Mona List in the Eiffel Tower above a tower of Faberge Eggs. Things don't just go together between the bun, they team up to create one of the most unique food experiences out there...particularly when their allies in the fry basket are competing for your attention.

It's a 5 minute drive from Mc Carran airport. Make this your first stop."}
{"text":"2 Words to describe - FAB ULOUS!!!!  Try the fish burger, the sweet potato fries, it's all simply delish!"}
{"text":"Ooooohhhhh yeeeeaaahhhh, everything is good here, best advice I can give for the menu, is try it all.  Very juicy burgers, prepare to get your hands messy."}
{"text":"This place is over rated and over priced - $14 for a fish sandwich? whatever....plus the service stinks...."}
{"text":"delicious juicy burgers! Great service! Every bite was amazing from the burgers to the oxtail fries. The duck buns were okay, id recommend the pork buns."}
{"text":"The day I came to eat here, I felt so bad, because I was \"THAT\" person. I didn't pay attention to the time and with no time left, I convinced my husband that we should absolutely try this place. Of course I didn't pull my head out of my a** until after we ordered a ton of food, and I realized that it was very unrealistic to even think that we would be finished within 20min. 
(SMH... i know that's exactly what i was thinking--I'm such an as*^ole!) 

 And that's when it happened, that's when I turned into \"THAT\"  person. --The person that just ordered their meal, and two seconds later wonders how much longer it will be. 
-The person who now has the patience of a 5 year old, and is forced due to their own stupidity and poor time management to tell the server to rush all the food
-The person who asks for to-go boxes and the check as soon as the food hits the table.
-The person who is frantically trying to hand over a credit card while inhaling food out of to-go boxes ( note to self: if you are in a hurry, then pay with cash!!!! )

I am so sorry for being \"THAT\" person. 
 :( I couldn't even enjoy the food, because I was inhaling it so fast... 

Either way, that is exactly why I love this place! They completely rose to the challenge! Not only did they serve us with a smile an absolute kindness, the food was incredible! They got me out on time, were very attentive, and even let me take \"happy hour\" food home
 (which I don't think they were supposed to, since their as**ole manager thought his staff and customers would appreciate him loosing his temper over it on the floor when he witnessed me receiving a to-go box.
 FYI- pointing at a table that is occupied, when you look like you are about to pop a vein, and simultaneously insist on raising your voice while disciplining an employee in the dining room that is full of customers, is not only poor management, but its inappropriate and it also may affect business. Just sayin... )

Anyway, the staff (minus management) was amazeballs!!! I absolutely recommend this place! And am planning on returning on a day that will allow me to enjoy the experience to the fullest."}
{"text":"we seen place on tripple d food network, after we seen the burgers, we new when we made it back to vegas, we were there, i'm here to tell you the pictures you see on yelp don't lie, these burgers were awesome, the kiki burger was sooo good & the truffle garlic fries uuuummm, my hubby had the banh mi burger gooood, a must try ......"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Had the Banh Mi Burger.  it was a teriyaki burger with vietnamese dipping sauce (fish sauce) with turnip and carrot (vietnamese salad) on the side.  
The Mr Ho burger was a hamburger made with lup cheong.  I think the banh mi was better.  The truffle fries were just ok.

I gave this place 4 stars was the wait help and hostess could have been friendlier.  

When we visit Vegas again, we'll surely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in Vegas. This spot is better than the other Bachi Burger joints in town. Better atmosphere, nicer employees, etc.

My boyfriend and I shared the Shogun Burger and the Oxtail Chili Fries. The Shogun Burger was one of the more expensive burgers ($26), consisting of Wagyu Beef and Unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo peach. The other burgers ranged about $10. We ordered it medium, but got it medium well. It wasn't really a big deal, but I know many people talking of having miscooked burgers. Other than that, it was amazing! Very flavorful, juicy, and well worth the money.

The oxtail chili fries are to die for. It comes with a fried egg on top of it, beans, peppers, etc. It was featured in an old episode of Guy Fieri's Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dive's, and it is well worth the hype.

I recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice Asian fusion to a regular American burger place. Have a little extra money to spend and craving a burger? Skip your McDonald's/In 'n' Out! This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"OMG! I came to Vegas for Iheartradio and i had to eat this place. 

WOW. I am lost for words. I got the

 KIKI Burger-Angus  Beef, Sautéed  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized  Bacon, Sweet  Onion  Marmalade, Gruyere  Cheese, Garlic  Chili, Aioli

Miyagi san burger -- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings

Ronin burger -- Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli

Hands down some delicious burgers. I WILL COME BACK. Service was on point and you got to get out of the strip to try some 'better' goods. WIN!"}
{"text":"Food, outstanding service pretty good when they come around, but they need a bigger place to handle the traffic 20 minute wait turned into an hour I fell asleep waiting that sucked! But glad to see they are kickin  gourmet  burger ass!"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for a while and finally got to try it this past weekend!

I spent the weekend in Vegas with my friends and on Sunday noon before heading home, we decided to check this place out. They opened at 12 and we got there at 12:20...there was already a 30 minute wait :o This place gets crazy crowded, so I only hoped it was because it was delicious.

Service here is pretty good. Workers were friendly and apologetic about the wait, even though it didn't seem TOO long. They were also very accommodating for out party of 11 :) I decided to order based on Yelp reviews, so I got the 'Ronin Burger' ($10) and our table got 4 orders of their Truffle Parmesan fries ($3.50 each) to share.

Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was funny because they recommended we should get the fries now instead of with our burgers because the burgers would take a long time, but we got our burgers a few minutes after we got our fries. So?? Haha I don't know.

The Ronin is a burger with caramelized onions, cole slaw, sesame dressing, fried egg (I asked to take it out since I don't like egg), Katsu BBQ sauce, and a yuzu citrus aioli on the side. The flavor was good, but I found it too be a little too sweet after a while. I think it was because of the BBQ sauce and caramelized onions together. Too much, plus I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ sauce. The truffle parmesan fries were really good. The fries are the thin cut type and were nicely crisp. They also came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was really good with the fries. MMMM :)

Prices are pretty reasonable and this location is pretty spacious. I would come back to try their other popular burgers (Kiki and Miyagi). Also, I hear they have good soft drinks, so I'll probably try those next, too!"}
{"text":"Spectacular.  Best burger I've had ever, anywhere, ever.  Sure you're gonna pay for it.  But it's well worth it.  I do it paleo style so no bun.  The sweet potato fries are totally legit.  My recommendation:  Build your own: protein style, bacon, fried egg, avocado.  Sweet potato fries and a Matcha iced tea."}

{"text":"Burger was real good. Fries were under cooked and not piping hot. Service was TERRIBLE! They must've been understaffed.  I was by myself but it took about 5 minutes to get seated.  After ordering burger and fries and waiting about 35 minutes I finally walked up to the server, thinking they might have forgotten me.  No apology, just said \"were crowded\". That attitude pretty much set the atmosphere for my meal. So, although the food was good it was hard to really enjoy."}
{"text":"I think Bachi Burger has some of the best burgers in town, but their execution as a restaurant just isn't my style. The restaurant is not a nice environment to dine in.  It has hard chairs and is very cafeteria-style. It's also usually loud and cold feeling.  My service there was awful last time I was in, and when I have been in I often wait for service and am not checked up on. The servers are friendly, they just aren't attentive, which makes it hard to enjoy a meal if it is cold by the time you get your sauce or your side.  The burgers are great though!"}
{"text":"All the times that I've been here, I was never let down with their food. I believe they deserve a review & 5 stars. I can honestly say EVERY burger is good here. I have tried the Kiki's, Ronin, and spicy miso. So far all have been amazing. Burgers range $10-15. You get to add extra toppings so i always add a fried egg or caramelized bacon on it. Highly recommend the Chili Oxtail Fries as a starter. You can't get it anywhere else! Its a huge serving so sharing would be good. Or try the salt & pepper fries for a smaller serving. They also have bachi bites added to their menu now for happy hour, so little plates if your not feeling a burger. The salted marshmellow milkshake is to die for. I love this place! The only thing I would say is on some days the food might take a while, but if u got good company, you wouldn't even notice."}
{"text":"Went back a day ago and the food was even better than the last few times. I got the spicy miso  burger which is what I usually get. For some reason it was wayyyy better than the last few times. I really enjoyed it. A little on the downside...The server was a bit slow and didn't refill our drinks- had to hunt him down and had to leave cash for the check because he didn't come back to swipe our card... But not a big deal, I understand he could have had a lot of tables. More like 4.5 stars but I round up in this case as the sever could have just been overwhelmed."}
{"text":"All burgers are great, I've had almost all of them! I love how they have this almost candied glaze on them. 
The oxtail fries are a party pleaser, the RAMEN from next door is next to the best base I have had in the valley. 
Contemporary, comfortable atmosphere with a hint of fun and sofistication. Definitely a great night to be had when you have Bachi Burger in your plans."}
{"text":"Have been here 2 times... Both times were great. The restaurant has very long wait times. My first attempt to go here I was to hungry to wait- second time I called ahead (5-10 min wait) but by the time I got there it was 25 min wait... it was worth it. I had onion ring app, the shogun burger and truffle fries. The second time I ordered to go- the veggie burger and a salad... the burger had a really thick slice of eggplant that was too much for me, but great otherwise. Will return and recommend"}
{"text":"The food... Was a 3-4 star.. That being said

Burgers came out over done 
Server forgot two appetizers 
Server forgot salads 
Server forgot our initial drink order and came to Re ask us not realizing he all ready took our order 

They auctioned off the food not knowing what seat ordered what 

Everyone was on edibles or something. Bad experience.

Adding to that... Asked for change for 100 and brought us 70!!!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 Stars. I was pressed for time since I needed to return a rental car and catch a plane. This southeast Bachi Burger location worked out conveniently and parking was easy to find since it's located at a strip center that  provided plenty of parking.

Since I had a late breakfast, I wasn't real hungry and opted for just the Kiki's burger - Angus beef, shiitake & eryngii mushrooms, enoki onion marinade, gruuere cheese and garlic chili aioli. The burger was perfection - cooked medium but still juicy. The bacon along with the mushrooms and aioli on the side was unusual but absolutely yummy. Service from my waitress was friendy and spot on!

Overall, I was impressed with my experience with Bachi Burger and I'm looking forward to returning and trying some other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars if I'm willing to come all the way from San Diego to Las Vegas for some burgers and fries.  The original location gets too crowded so I was happy to drive to their newer and bigger location in Summerlin.  

I had the Oxtail chili cheese fries with fried egg. Yum!  How freakin OG is that? For my burger, the Mr. Ho's.  How can you go wrong with lup cheong and taro bun? 

The overall menu is inventive and creative.  I'm a fan and can't wait until Bachi Burger comes to my city."}
{"text":"***Sucks that Bachi Burger is closed on Mondays- I am a witness to many cars driving up,reading the sign and then sadly driving away....***

On a Sunday we were needing our Bachi Burger fix so we quickly fulfilled our needs....
We were seated right away-it was busy but a table became free for us instantly just like it was written in the stars....
I'll just talk about items I got that I didn't talk about in my last review :

- Fried Chicken Appetizer- Yummy with good dipping sauce- all I needed was a scoop of rice and this could've been my meal.
- Shrimp Chips - So good, salty-crispy yumminess...
- Crusty Crab Burger- I wanted to try something different than my usual Ronin Burger so I chose this-it was good but a little too seafood tasting for me- 
-Kiki's Burger - The BF liked this one but had to ask for extra sauce
-Calamansi/Lime Soda- To wash all this yummy food down we tried two of their house made mix soda's- this was tangy refreshing
-Lychee/Apple Soda - This one was more on the sweeter side than the other drinks- It was OK but I prefer the Calamansi Drink instead...

Yummy visit and will be back and Oh I have to mention that service has extremly improved and is quick...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during my bachelor party.   Ooops, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Well, it was all over my social network since I saw at least a dozen pictures of the Shogun burger with my name tagged on it.  What is the Shogun burger?  Well, it's the biggest, baddest Japanese style burger you ever feasted your eyes upon.  Imagine a huge kobe beef patty with fois gras (duck) and unagi (eel) topped with some of that secret special sauce.  Let's say that's one of the most unique tasting burger I had in my life.  I never imagined unagi tastes so good next to beef.  Fois gras is default good for those sophisticated eaters.

You're probably wondering what else is on the menu.  Well, they had more earthly hamburgers compared to the heavenly Shogun burger, fries, duck entree, etc.  Just look at the website and you will know but I'll end the review that Shogun burger is the best!

Side note: A shogun is a military ruler (think dictator or general) of medieval Japan.  Essentially they had all the power over their territory."}
{"text":"Things have changed here. ..  I'm disappointed.   I really loved this place,  brought family here,  told friends to try it,  and was so happy when they opened one in Pasadena.

Cane back to visit.   Wasn't busy.   We were seated as soon as we walked in.  Things have changed.   I was aware they added the Pho side,  menu now reflects that.

But service was a little slow.   Slower rhan it should be when they dont have all rhe tables filled.  And i was sad that they had removed the chocolate lava cake I loved so much.  but I  was surprised even more that my favorite burger tasted not so great any more.  It lacked the great flavors and the egg was oveecooked. The salt, pepper, and garlic fries were just OK, not fantastic as I remembered  them.  And hubby was soooo disappointed when his medium rare burger came well done.  Instead of sending it back he ate with a smile because this meal was not going to ruin our vacation.  I wish we could do 1/2 stars, this would be 2 1/2 and not 3.

But I dont know if we'll be back on our next visit or try and find another burger place..."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! I had the no meat burger with crispy onions on top and it was fantastic! Also shared the truffle fries and the salt and pepper fries! Truffle ones were my favorite! Definitely would visit here again!"}
{"text":"The wait is way too long for a damn burger. Orders would take forever to come out and some tables would get there order faster than others. Yes the food is good but not good enough to wait 45 to sit down & 35 mins to wait for your food. Service was nice but I would not come back. It's a Sunday after noon and it's not even that busy."}
{"text":"To ALL burger buffs, meat hounds, Asian flavor fanatics, diner devotees and to just-plain ol' hungry human beings:

I dedicate this experience to you all!

It all started one cold Saturday evening in February 2014 when the bf and I decided to pop our Bachi Burger cherry. Wait time: 25-30 minutes. Though medium-to-large groups lingered in and around the restaurant, these groups were diminishing at a pretty impressive pace. Names were being called from left to right. It didn't take long until the hostess finally said what I've been yearning to hear for the past half hour...\"Rachel.\"

Once seated, the menus eagerly flipped open and the bf and I were enticed to such great heights. The selection of starters and burgers were bountiful but after careful consideration the lucky winners went as followed:

Ox-tail chili cheese fries:
This appetizer should be a REQUIREMENT when dining here. A large, hot plate stacked with crispy thin fries immersed in generous amounts of salty and savory chili, shredded ox-tail AND crowned with a perfectly fried egg--tell me what's not to like? This portion is perfect for 2 adults with a tenacious appetite.

Kiki burger (my choice):
I knew this burger was calling to me when I first read caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade. The words 'caramelized' and 'sweet' being the major deal breakers. Unfortunately, that's where the courtship between Kiki and I comes to an end. Though the meat patty excelled in juiciness and the bacon maintained its candied glaze, it fell short elsewhere. I was underwhelmed by the not-so-sweet-non-existent-taste-of-onion marmalade and the slight bitterness of the greens. But it wasn't a total fail for my appetite. Like a short-lived romance with an ex--we shared some good moments and also some bad--but in the end, I never really saw any great potential. Kiki just wasn't meant for me.

Ronin burger (the bf's choice):
Any burger with a fried egg is pretty much en route to the bf's belly. There's no way he's going to let it slip on by. The only problem with this burger was that it was HIS and not mine. We cut both our burgers in half and traded so we could sample each others but deep-down inside as soon as I sunk my teeth into this burger I was hooked. Ronin grabbed a hold of my taste buds and never wanted to let go. It was love at first bite. So many wonderful things were happening in my mouth that made it nearly impossible to ingest. An orchestra of flavors and textures that was beautifully executing a rhapsody. I wanted to salvage the juiciness of the meat, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the tang and crunch of the coleslaw and even the saltiness of the fried egg. Bravo Ronin. Bravo!

If my experience doesn't make you want to feed the beast then you're completely and utterly missing out. Bachi Burger is a MUST try when in Vegas. Their Asian-fusion/Asian-inspired take on the classical American burger is pure genius.

Don't believe me? Then just listen to what your inner soul is saying because I'm pretty sure it sounds something like this...

GO. TO. BACHI BURGER.

NOW!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, I rate this place the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas.
They have great service  and even a server that looks and acts like Jimmy Fallon! YEAH! Seriously! HAHAHAHA!!!
They change up their dessert menu every so often but they haven't disappointed me yet.
Their kalbi, bachi fish, and wagu burger are my favorites. They also have items you can add on to your burger like fried egg, shishito peppers, avocado, and so on. Their sweet fries and truffle parm fries are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Miyagi burger !!! 
Came to visit since I was in Vegas! 
The food was delicious! I ordered the miyagi, pork belly sliders, and fries! They were all delicious and I could say this is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The combo of everything is perfect. I loved the egg that was in the burger. Definitely will be one of my go-to place when I visit Vegas! 
It was my first time and it won't be my last."}

{"text":"So we finally tried Bachi Burger!  Another bookmark to check off of my list!

Bachi Burger has been on my radar since I saw it DDD on the Food Network.  We were finally in the neighborhood and hungry at the same time, so we popped in for lunch.  When we walked in, the place was almost empty, but the hostess (who thought very highly of herself, if I do say so) said we needed to wait to be seated for a while.  We weren't in a hurry, so we waited, but thought it was weird.  We were finally seated 5 minutes later at a table that had been empty and clean the entire time.  We then waited at least 5 minutes for our server to come by to get our drink order.  When she came back with our drinks we were ready to order since we had been there quite some time by this point.  

We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the Miyagi-san burger with the sea salt and pepper garlic fries.  The burgers were quite yummy and we liked the different flavors going on, but they weren't extremely special.  We did really like them though.  The fries were good as well, but not anything spectacular.   I didn't taste any garlic, onion sea salt, or really anything exciting.  They tasted like fries from a regular fast food joint, not gourmet fancy fries. 

The prices seem to be really high here as well.  I get that they are uber-modern, doing the hip fusion menu thing, and you have been on the Food Network, but I expected a little more umph for the price.  Our burgers were $10 and $13.5 dollars and we had to pay another $4 for fries.  The burgers were delish and probably worth the price, but I think the mediocre fries could have been thrown in, instead of a side item to add on. 

As for our service, all I can say is ugh!  I don't know what it is with my hubby and I, but we always seem to get the worst server in the place for our server.   We are so super easy and never high maintenance, especially since I used to work in the restaurant industry for years. Our server just seemed overwhelmed, even though I only saw her waiting on our table and 1 other.  She rarely checked on us.  I think we saw her 3 times the whole meal.  We got better service from surrounding servers, bussers, and the food runners.

So the food warrants a return visit because we did enjoy it.  I just hope we get a better server and tastier fancy fries."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star burger.  Easily making my top 10 burger list.  But do to the service both before and during the restaurant will get only 3 stars. I don't like paying 15 for a burger and fries either, but didn't mind as much here. 

I had the Kiki burger.  Wow was this burger put together good.  The meat was tasty and flavorful. The caramelized bacon,  mushrooms and cheese make this one great burger. Even though this is like no burger you have ever made at home.  We'll unless your dad is a Japanese chef. So not traditional but a really great burger. 

Now on to the service. The hostess was having people wait even though the restaurant was half empty. I mean really.  Just because the is the norm when you are busy doesn't mean you have to do the same when you are not.  Please get your nose out of the air. As well wasn't to thrilled with the waiting staff either.  For crying out loud you serve burgers. Quit trying to be stuck up, or should I say quit being stuck up.

Overall a great burger with a not so great experience."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this out. Good burger. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had. Burger was made to order medium and another one supposed to be medium rare but came out medium. My wife said the burger was just ok Bc if she had to asked for ketchup then it wasn't too memorable for her. Fries are food. Cut small and tossed with salt and pepper and jalapeño.  
Service was good.  Place was clean"}
{"text":"Started with the oxtail chili fries. They were tasty and a bit spicy, but not OMG so good. I can't say I would order that again. 

Also ordered the miyagi-San burger. It was so juicy and cooked to perfection, although my friends burger was a bit over cooked based on what he asked for. You really have to flatten these bad boys down and be sure to come hungry because it's a lot of food to eat!"}
{"text":"On the hunt for a burger joint away from the strip, I found this gem. 

The restaurant itself is classy and completely lacks the fast food feel. 

You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu  since all of them are done well.  Just make sure you get your burgers cooked medium for that extra juicy, juice. 

Highly praised from me and my friends: Ronin burger, \"Ban Mi\" burger dipped with a light nuoc mam sauce, The Crusty Crab, and the Truffled Parmesan Fries. 

Mission accomplished. Burger craving satiated."}
{"text":"a good variety of burgers. sweet potatoes fries were super delicious and they come with a wasabi sauce. they have god drinks, some beer and wine and iced teas. I asked to replace a meat burger with veggie patty for me and they did and it was delicious. It's a good asian fusion place with good customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i tried the Ronin burger and it was okay. It wasn't anything extraordinary and something i could have made at home. However, the service was impeccable! We ordered fries that didn't come out until we were pretty much done with our meal. The server took it off the bill and still brought it to us. Our pepsi was refilled when the cup was half full. Bottom line is, food was good but the service was better!"}
{"text":"mmm, I love burgers. I came here for dinner after eating smashburger the night before and then a burger from honey salt at lunch. So.... I'm kinda obsessed with burgers. I had wanted to try this place out after seeing it on the food network, especially since the oxtail chili fries were on there. I loved them, they were really delicious! I also shared a burger since I pretty much ate all the fries. I got the miyagi burger, and I really enjoyed the mixture of flavors and the burger was perfectly cooked. Try this place out! Service was really slow though when I was here, but the manager apologized and gave my friend and I two free drinks :)"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER in Las Vegas... period! I do a different burger everytime I come here and its puts a big smile in my belly! Keep up the great food Bachi!"}
{"text":"A bit overhyped. Got there before 6, slow service, only 2 people working. Ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries, Kiki burger medium with over easy egg, and myagi-san burger medium with over easy egg. Fries are awesome, that's why it's 2 stars instead of 1. However both burgers were over cooked and so were the eggs. The burgers leave more to be desired for, especially at close to $14. 

Also they have happy hour 3-6 but didn't tell us that or give us a menu. 

Overall if the food was cooked better the way we wanted it I would rate it higher. But you have to make the food the way it was ordered. I'd skip it"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Food was superb, atmosphere was marginal, and service was pretty good. My friends and I enjoyed it. It's too bad they ran out of taro bread.

 I went to the other Bachi Burger location a few months back but they ran out of the popular items! I was determined to try again, but at another location so here it is!"}
{"text":"Order the Miyagi-San burger to go.. It was a big mess and not too tasty also order the salt and pepper fries.. Not salty at all and the peppery part is a few slices of jalapeños..Will I go back again?? Most likely not.  Especially when I threw away 3/4 of my $25 burger and fries. At least I can say I've tried them.. I rather go to In and out and order a #3 with hot peppers and a drink for under $6 bucks and you can really taste it"}
{"text":"ERMAHGERDDDD. This place is SO DAMN DELICIOUS. Definitely lived up to its hype. I first went to the location on Windmill and that place had a long wait so they told us about this location and came here instead and had no wait at all! 

We ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries & oh my goodness, it was amazing. But the best part of my meal was my Green & Black Burger. The wagyu patty was so mouth-watering good. You can add that patty to your burger & it'll come out to $16. A bit on the pricier end but def worth the money. 

I just realized they have a place in Pasadena, close to where I live so yay! Will def be stopping by there in the near future."}
{"text":"I had Adrian as my server and wow what a great experience! He recommended me the oxtail fries and Jesus Christ those were to die for! This place is not only fast but the hospitality is amazing! Paul also checked up on me a couple of times and he looked like a dam Korean pop star! Thanks again Bachi for the great experience! Will definitely be coming back soon. Maybe even tomorrow haha"}
{"text":"If you want to venture off the strip and want to taste the local flavor that Las Vegas has to offer then bachi burger is a must.a cozy spot nestled in a town center that is occupied by some random business,this little gem stands out like a diamond in the ruff offering ox tail fries,truffle fries (my favorite) and assorted burgers and sandwiches.a good beer list is also available.bottom line.......COME HERE"}
{"text":"One dang burger fresh wagyu beef with jalapenos and an egg on top sincerely awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers seriously rock! My favorites are the Ronin and the Miyagi-san. My wife and son are not crazy about the fries and the beer menu could be improved, which is why I did not give this great burger joint 5 stars. It's hard to justify a $11-13 burger more than a handful of times per year. But when I am in the mood for a great craft burger Bachi is the place!"}
{"text":"Excellent ! Got the oxtail chili fries , edamame,  and the kiki burger . Chef is from Hawaii , wish we can have one at home !!!!! This is definitely a place to try ! Kua'aina, u got some competition!"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and after all my experiences I give this joint 3 stars. 

Bachi has friendly service, but kinda slow most of the time even if your a party of two, which can get kinda tricky if you like to get a fast meal and be on your merry way... quickly.

Their fries, salads,  drinks and burgers are always great, but can be a bit on the over savory side, especially if your having the lonely bird chicken/turkey burger and I'm not sure if it's a glaze they use or just bbq sauce...???

Any who, this joint has great food and I recommend it highly especially if you don't mind taking your time. Good job BB!"}
{"text":"It was decent. I did the bahn mi burger and truffle fries. The burger was interesting on its own. The disc of pork on it was about the size of an avg tomato slice. Not clear if that intentional or a bit of cook laziness for a dish made too many times. The other accoutrements were also underwhelming but that may have been to let the patty shine (good flavor there). Fries were NOT worth the extra money. Staff overall had a solid pleasantness to them. Not impressed that one of the cooking staff was camping by the front door where customers come in - hope management can fix that."}
{"text":"This place was great! The Oxtail chili cheese fries were everything Guy said they would be. A must try. I had the Miyagi-Sans's burger. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had. This place is worth the short drive off the strip!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Decor, food, everything...but staff was slacking. Food wise, loved it. When we came in there was a couple of tables filled but definitely less than 30% occupied. Host said we needed to wait 20 min for a table because they were short staffed!

He could have sat us and at least offered drinks. Since we were on vacation and we loved the burgers we waited...sitting on the uncomfortable seats with 116 heat blasting us...

He did this to a couple more parties looking to eat there while we waited...they all left and went somewhere else to eat. If not for his service, this would have been a 5 star review. Also, normally service like this brings a place immediately down to 3 stars for me....that's how good the burgers are!

Just hope you don't get the same host as us."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Service is good, music does not fit!  They need to play things that relax you a bit.  Too loud."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant on a recommendation from my seasoned Vegas-visiting friends. 

The service was prompt, courteous, but a bit brisk for my liking. I sat at the bar with a glass of wine and was leafing through my work while I ate. My waitress was pushing for me to put my food in to-go boxes within 35 mins of me being seated and I had eaten less than half my appetizer and entree. I looked around and saw only half the tables were occupied at 9PM and asked her if they were closing soon- she blushed and said they closed at 11PM. She didn't make me feel comfortable or welcome as a solo diner and I got my check right after and left.

However foodwise-

I ordered the signature Oxtail fries and the Black and Green Burger. Both were solid choices. They both had a great blend of textures and flavors. Sweet, tangy, savory, garlicky, a hint of spice, and some crunch here and there- I would highly recommend both dishes! I appreciated the fact they didn't over-season the fries so it would balance out the intensity of the Oxtail chili flavors and dressed with jalapeños, cilantro, and a garlic Sriracha aioli. The burger also packed an explosion of flavor with the roasted garlic and blue cheese cutting into the savory sautéed mushrooms and beef, using the spinach as a medium to round the flavors out.

The cocktail and wine menu choices were okay, the beer selection was awesome. I wouldn't be able to handle eating here too often but would definitely come back if friends wanted to check the place out."}
{"text":"The burgers themselves were okay, I wasn't necessarily a big fan of the bun because I wish it had been toasted, but instead it was super soft- I guess more of a style preference.  I had the Kalbi burger and the Ronin burger on two separate occasions.  I think the Ronin burger tasted better than the Kalbi burger.

Didn't particularly like the parmesan truffle fries as much compared to Umami Burger.  These fries were very messy to eat with and weren't as tasty.

The ox-tail chili cheese fries were interesting.  There was a spicy kick to it and it was definitely unique.

Overall, I think there is a lot that can be said about these interesting combinations for burgers.  Give it a try and see if you like 'em!"}
{"text":"I don't even know if the owners read yelp but they should.  I used to love coming here and loved bragging about it. What happened slowest service ever, hostess with major attitude and doesn't smile.  

Last night I wanted to introduce my friend to bachi because I talk so highly about this place, major fail !  The guy host was kool he put our name down and said it was about a 45 min wait.  There was no room to sit so we walked across the street And set a timer on our phone to come back in 30 mins just incase we get called sooner.  While waiting I just looked up yelp reviews out of boredom and I read a one star review from a guy below, how they told him an hour and he came back earlier and they skipped over him and the hostess was super rude to him so he didn't even get to try the amazing food.  I thought it was unfortunate. Then same shit happened to us but we made the mistake of staying. 

We came back in 30 mins instead of 45 and there was a gal at the host stand this time, we gave our names and she stated,  \" I called you guys and u weren't here so u have to be put on the end of the list, that's why I tell people to tell me you're leaving. Our cooks a falling behind today\"

Wtf woman u didn't tell us shit because u weren't the ones to put our name down.  The guy then came back n told her we were up next. Nice save dude and thank u. 

They appeared short staff, our server Ratha super sweeetheart she gets 5 stars.   Food slowwwww I feel bad for the cooks the hostess said you are slow, but I still love the food so yum. 

What killed it was the host chick, whatever you're going through leave it at home.  You're the first face people see when they walk in. 

Reading more about past employees it makes sense, having a bad boss is like a cancer.  

The food is still great but I'm hesitant to bring my friends here from out of state because of the service.  And that sucks because they really want to try bachi.  Maybe I'll just make the drive to the other location.  I think I will take them to Holsteins to be safe.  I now owe my friend a better dinner, and I should have listened to yelp. 

Dear cooks your food rocks! I will miss your food:("}
{"text":"We went to Bachi Burger before a show at UNLV, and were blown away by the incredible burger and fries selection.  Let's start with the basics.  Bachi is the brainchild of Lori Watada, formerly Roy Yamaguchi's sous chef.  Imagine the best burgers in the world, done in a variety of asianesque styles, with a full compliment of appetizers, Japanese style pickles, entrees for those who don't like beef, and amazing fries...  I got the Shogun, their most expensive burger, a rare and heodistic tribute to all that is fat and good in a burger of wagyu beef, plus pan seared fois gras, unagi (broiled eel for those of you who don't know, a stunningly delicious Japanese staple), poached pear and secret sauce.  The burger was cooked perfectly (medium rare equals rare, but that is how you want American wagyu), and eating it was a nearly religious experience.  My wife got the Keki, smothered in premium mushrooms and a delicious sauce.  The parmesan truffle oil fries were good....but not great, and the sweet potato fries were perfect.  I am going to have to go back and eat my way through the rest of the menu.....
Our service was good, especially given how busy it was, and we noticed that they were turning people away 20 minutes after we got there at 6pm becasue the place was full and there was a waiting list.  They serve a limited array of wine, beers sake and drinks....in a casual setting that is just crowded enough to feel like you are part of something.  I have decided that in all Las Vegas this is my new go to burger spot....
The burgers cost $9 to $25 (the Shogun), and I cannot wait to go back!  
They are opening a fine dining spot next door....that will be on my list too...."}
{"text":"This place looks like everything is amazing based on all previous reviews but first hand experience is its not so great. I would lije to say it is worth going to at least once but that would be a lie."}
{"text":"Well back again to review Bachi Burger one of my favorite bun made burgers but this time was a little bit different as I came in and I was waiting I noticed my waiter was taking care of those tables and he was right on top of it so if you come to Bachi Burger for their Infamous find me Burger don't forget to sit in Marcos station he is the best"}
{"text":"awesome oxtail frys. All my friends are hooked now. Had the kimchi burger which is amazing as well."}
{"text":"There's a reason there tends to be a wait at Bachi Burger. I love the fusion of flavors, and these burgers are too good to pass up! My go to is the Spicy Miso Burger, and I love Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries to go with it!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, and it never disappoints. Always good. There is nothing to complain about here, and their creativity is awesome. This isn't a place you would compare to in n out or fat burger. It's a different kind of place.
Asian fusion at its best, good quality ingredients, and a friendly local atmosphere. You could roll up in here like you're going to eat a fast food place, but be treated to an excellent experience. They might be a little short staffed from what I've seen, but it's for some reason kind of acceptable. Appetizers are top notch, drinks are good, and if you're not used to eating certain things you don't have to worry...they do it in a way that any palate can handle it. Great place I don't know why it took so long to review."}
{"text":"boyfriends family took us to dinner here since we were in town and we are sooooo obsessed! We are already planning to go back when in town again!! 

We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle fries and onion rings! OMG! delicious! I swear the best truffle fries I have ever had cause they glazed the top with the oil too! 

I had the Kalbi burger and the fam had the miso, black and green, and the bahn mi burger
my burger was korean bbq goodness, with the kimchi and everything! A must try! I had a bite of all the burgers on the table and was not disappointed. Ended with the lava cake for dessert and that also was delish! order it when you order the burgers as it take about 20-25 min to make =)

definitely cannot wait to try the other locations (since they have different menus)


Loveee this place!"}
{"text":"Food
$12 Ronin Burger
The Ronin buger was pretty much BBQ and egg. It has a strong Korean BBQ flavor but it was super messy. The mustard that came with it was uncessary since the burger was already flavorful enough.

$10 Shoya ramen
The ramen had very few toppings and a slice of fat. The broth was too salty for me. 

$4 Shake
It's kinda hard to screw up a shake because it's usually two ingredients and that's about it. The shake was nothing special but it looked pretty. 

Decor
The interior is hip and modern. Women's bathroom was broken ...not that I go there regularly or anything. Their website sucks. It doesn't have the prices and I don't really care about their origin story.

Service
The ramen and burger are cooked in separate kitchens so they might come out a different times. 

Would I come here again? 
Probably, though I would try something different on the buger menu and avoid the ramen menu."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was alright. 

Oxtail fries: something different, it wasn't bad but tasted more like barbecue baked beans with fries than oxtail. Just hints of oxtail. Makes for a cool name though. 

Mr. Ho's burger: another unique creation featuring a taro bun. It's reminiscent of dim sum flavored to me, I'd call it dim sum burger. It's like a fancy cousin of a barbecue pork bum. 

Kiki's burger: all I can recall of this one was enoki mushrooms. Patty was juicy and flavorful. 

All the food tasted good, seething to try if you're looking for burgers with a twist. Prices aren't too bad either. Burgers range from $11-26"}
{"text":"I got to say I was not impressed.  My husband and daughters have dined here in the past, but last night was my first experience and it was not good.  We took 6 people there from out of town and it was around 8PM.  We were seated rather quickly and then the troubles began.  My guests ordered the tapioca drinks and the rest of our party ordered beers and cider.  Beers and cider were brought to the table quickly, but halfway into receiving appetizers, tapioca drinks were still missing.  I said something to the server and then a little while later those drinks came out, dripping all over the table and it was quite a mess.  I was stunned that no one in the kitchen had the sense to wipe and clean the glasses off.  On to appetizers.  We ordered shrimp chips, no cigar.  They were out of them.  Truffle fries were just so so.  The Oxtail fries were not the greatest.  The beans were far too raw. I am not talking al dente, rather RAW.  Now come our burgers.  I ordered the Kiki, medium well.  It so happens I get the mid rare. When the overly zealous manager came to check on how everything was I showed him my not so cooked burger.  He took it away.  15 minutes later, everyone else at the table was done eating and my burger appears.  Not a newly fired one, but the one I took a bite out of.  I thought they should have redone my order, not try to recook it.  All in all, I was very disappointed and somewhat embarrassed taking some very important people there.  And, our tab was in excess of $120, which, in my opinion, is a little pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"Made it on my top ten worst burger.
Oxtail chili cheese fries are overrated. 

Dry meat, couldn't taste any of the ingredients on the burger cause over powered by the sauce. 
Bun was a stale sweet roll.
Not to mention, everything was slightly sweet, which gets really boring for the palate. 

They do cook an egg well. 

Will not be back.  Feel gross and ripped off."}
{"text":"When Bachi Burger opened in my hometown of Los Angeles, it received average Yelp reviews and closed before I could try it. I now see why. The carelessly prepared food fits at this suburban movie theater location, but not in a food-centric district like Little Osaka in West LA.

The pork belly steamed buns were nicely constructed with a savoy cabbage and carrot slaw, slice of hard-boiled egg, and hoisin sauce, but the meat was sloppily inconsistent. Of the three buns served, one had pork that was all meat and no fat, another had all fat and no meat, and another had the right balance (much like the three bears). A 33% success rate might work in baseball's batting box, but not when dining.

I liked the fries in the chili cheese fries, but that was about it. There was too much of the heavily spiced oxtail chili in ratio with the fries and the scant amount of cheese. The chili also showed signs of age. The meat had broken down to almost a paste, the mixture lost its ability to emulsify which caused the excessive amount of oil to separate out, and there was a sour taste like it hadn't been cooled properly from the night before. The fried egg on top didn't fit the dish.

I guess I should have tried a burger and plain fries instead of the fancier sounding appetizers because I incorrectly expected food of greater quality."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here.  Asian inspired burgers doesn't appeal to me(and I'm Asian).  When I want a burger, I want a burger with ketchup, mayo, mustard, tomatoes, onion, lettuce, and maybe an avocado.  But this place was nice. although I won't be getting any hankerings for the burgers here(personal preference) there is nothing bad about the food here. Not over salted or over seasoned the flavors are mellow and easy.  It's clean, staff is friendly, food is fresh, and they are creative."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Heard about this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and of course we had to come here. When we first arrived it was semi busy got a seat really fast. Although the food my boyfriend and I ordered took a while it was worth the wait! At first when we looked at the menu the ingredients for the burger were unique and not something you normally have. I got the Kiki's burger which I highly recommend (it was that good). My boyfriend got the Banh Mi burger that is full of flavor! To top it off I forgot to mention that as an appetizer we got the oxtail fries. The fries were gone within 5 seconds!! Highly recommend this place to anyone who come to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"What happened Bachi Burger?! When you first opened i remember this being a great place! Now.. just 2 stars just for the oxtail fries. The last two times we have gone in, it wasn't even busy (only one or two other tables in the place) and we waited 10 minutes just for water. We love the oxtail fries! I always ask for no cilantro and yet every time i end up picking it out. We ordered beer and it didn't come. Then our server went MIA for about 15-20 min while we waited for our check. I was really looking forward to a shake this last time, but by the time we saw our server we didn't have time to wait. Oh well. My blizzard from DQ after was bomb!"}
{"text":"On the food network I saw a promo for a hamburger called Bahn Mi burger, the burger looked so damn good that I wrote down the info and even took a screen shot of the note.  This past weekend while in Vegas I decided to head down there to give it a try. Omg! This place is legit, I actually ended up ordering the Ronin burger and truffle Parmesan fries and a 1/4 of my wife's Kiki burger, also so good! Lastly, we ordered the soufflé which was more like a lava cake with vanilla ice cream but so damn good too. Only bad part was the 25 minute wait for the soufflé; but all in all, I needed to be pallet jacked out of there cz I was so full. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here just because of Triple D and well, it was OK. We had the Shogun burger, Kiki burger and sweet potato fries, we also ordered the sausages but they neglected to write it down.

The Kiki burger was good, the sweet potato fries were delicious, but the Shogun burger in my opinion was too rich, I didn't like the taste, maybe I ordered the wrong burger for myself but it wasn't good. Sorry.

2 burgers, 1 fries, $55 later. You be the judge."}
{"text":"WE LITERALLY WAITED AN HOUR TO GET OUR FOOD. We went up three times to ask where our food was and they kept saying: \"oh just couple more minutes\" AND EACH TIME THEY TOLD US THAT 20 minutes passed. AND THEY STOPPED SERVING BOBA WHEN BOBA WAS THE WHOLE REASON I WANTED TO COME HERE. THERE IS A PICTURE OF BOBA IN THEIR SIGN. HOW DECEIVING. 
The name of the restaurant is appropriate.  Our group of 15 were all hungry and excited to eat when we arrived ... then  BACHI ... which means misfortune in Japanese.  The staff was just going thru the motions, not very accommodating, and customer service was lacking.  Yes, it was near the end of the working day for them but closing time is 11:00 pm and the staff needs to continue providing good customer service to the end.  The food strangely came out in increments and the wait was one very long hour.  When the food finally arrived, we were starving and devoured our burgers ... which made our stomachs ache after ...BACHI."}
{"text":"This place definitely meets up to the quality of the other locations. Had the kalbi burger and oxtail fries. The food came out pretty quick and delicious. I also love the decor. Looks like this place does breakfast, but I haven't tried it yet. I'm very interested in trying the loco moco with wagyu beef."}
{"text":"YAY! I'm a fan of the food. Service wasn't great... A 3 star for service. 

I will return."}
{"text":"Most pretentious place I have EVER eaten. The chef \"doesn't believe in ranch dressing\". 3/4 of the items on the menu have ingredients that you can only pronounce if you are fluent in every language in Europe and Asia. I hope that this review saves at least one person from eating here."}
{"text":"The place is a bit over-hyped but its definitely a great innovative burger joint! The food choices is definitely asian-inspired where it brings multiple cultures mixed together very well. 

It had a burger with Foie Gras which was pricey but very very well made. They had some burgers with eggs in it which was a huge plus for me as I'm an eggs guy!

Their pork belly steam buns was point on and just fantastic! 

The nacho fries was just over the top!

Red Velvet smoothie really tasted like it! I only wished they were generous of the portion especially when it was $5!!

The service could have been more attentive, but they were definitely sweethearts making sure we were taken care of when they notice you."}
{"text":"Unreal burgers with a crazy Asian influence. Please don't ask me to write the names of any of their burgers, but their food is like an explosion of flavors!!!! When you visit Las Vegas, you have to try this place.... But after one of their burgers get ready to take a nap"}
{"text":"Where do I even start! If you have a chance to get off the strip, this place is amaze-balls! I dont think there's anything on the menu that I didn't like AND theres a No meat burger for all you vegetarians out there!

I came here with the family and a game plan. We ordered a total of 8 burgers and split 6 among 5 people (the \"No Meat Here.. was for the vegetarian and we got 2 spicy miso). BEST IDEA ever, since we rarely come to vegas and wanted to try a little of everything. Everything we got medium except the wagyu - medium rare. Here are my rankings from best to good because let's face it, all the burgers were delicious. 

*Shogun Burger - Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach.
 The is probably the most expensive burger on the menu but so worth it. Slightly sweet from the pear and peach but savory with the melt in your mouth Wagyu beef. AND unagi (eel)!!! they do not skimp!

*The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger - Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce. 
Who needs Lee Sandwiches when you got this burger. Absolutely perfect! You don't even need the pickled veggies on the side because it's perfectly balanced without it.

*Spicy Miso Burger - Angus Beef, Onions, Shishito Pepper, Mayo, Lettuce, Roasted Garlic, Swiss Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette.
Perfectly fried egg! When you cut into it, the yolk just oozes. Not spicy like Sriracha  spicy but as in a little kick for your taste buds. 

*Mr. Hos Burger - Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sautéed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, Taro Bun. 
That Taro Bun though! So good i'd buy the bun if they sold it separately. Flavors are light, sweet and salty and savory.

*Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings.
Onions Rings on a Burger?! I'm sold! 

*Kalbi Burger - Angus Beef, Kalbi Marinade, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo. 
You definitely need to eat this with the picked cucumbers on the side. This burger was light in flavor so it relied heavily on the kim chee and pickled veggies to give you that punch."}
{"text":"says on their website they close at 11pm. got there at 9:50 pm and they said they were already closed. another party came after us also thinking they're open til 11.

came another time and we were super excited since we saw them featured on food network. burgers seemed overpriced but what the heck! we had to try it since it's on tv...not sure what all the hype is about. their burgers are eeehhh just ok. no \"wow\" factor. not impressive at all. we ordered 3 different burgers and none stood out as impressive. the buns also felt super buttered and greasy. i think the only thing we liked were the oxtail fries. other than that, we'll go to in and out burger for wayyy tastier burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent food! This place is a fusion of Asian and burgers and it doesn't disappoint. I got the Mr. Miagi-san burger, which was a unique blend of a burger and Korean BBQ. It was big and messy, but so delicious I didn't care. The milkshakes might be the best thing though. I had the salted caramel marshmallow shake and it tasted like a camping trip from my childhood. I ordered a second one almost immediately after I tasted the first. If your looking for a good burger place or good fusion that's off the strip, try this place!!"}
{"text":"Have to try this place it's insane how many flavors they can pack into the food. It's amazing and best ramen ever!!"}
{"text":"Yumm. I split the pork belly steamed buns and wagyu burger with one other. Both were delicious. Pork belly steamed buns were so unique and tasty. Wagyu burger was just a very well executed burger with tons of flavor. Parmesan truffle fries were good, not spectacular. Decent beer selection, though they were out of the one I wanted. Will definitely come back here next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good the food is pretty amazing and I am not sure if I can even eat all of my food in one sitting the portion sizes r so crazy. It's a little pricey but worth trying it once and the fries r so good. Give the dessert a try, always good how can u do bad by dessert. If u order the donuts u might need to wait a while if u place an order for pick up early, no big deal bc when u get delicious little things u will be very happy that u waited and the ice cream that comes along w/it so good. Service is great at this location."}
{"text":"The burgers are always super great, and I always come back. I've been coming here since they opened. The service though... Has not changed since then. I thought it was normal ohh new restaurant opening they need to find their grove and figure out timing etc. yeeaaahhhh no. It could still use tons of improvement. Not that the anyone is really rude or anything. But food takes forever, the lack of skill, lack of organization, no ever seems apologetic when your food comes out wrong or late, cause it happens sooo often. Normally food coming out wrong isn't an issue, but the last 5 times I've gone this year it has. Those are just the some of them. I'm not saying don't come here to eat. You should the food is good. All I'm saying is prepare to a wait a long time for stuff. To get someone to come to your table, or get your drink, or the food. When stuff comes out right or at a some what decent time you like totally think it's a Christmas miracle. If not for the less than mediocre arrive the place would have a 5."}
{"text":"I have been here on many different occasions and the food is always worth the Terrible service. This past visit was probably the worse I have experienced. We walked in to our surprise there was no wait when they usually always run a long wait. After we were seated it took over 10 min for our server to come over. We ordered 2 different cocktails that they were out of so we had to stick to just ice tea. After ordering our food the wait for our food was over 30 minutes really for a wedge salad. After our server took our order she was never to be seen again someone else delivered our food and we were never checked on through out our meal. After we were done with food and left parched because no one came to refill our drinks she dropped off the check. Server again was no where to be found so someone else took our payment which took another 10 mom for them to bring the card back for us to sign. If the food wasn't so good I would have stopped going there a long time ago."}
{"text":"Went there and ordered salad (BIG MISTAKE), 3/4 of my salad had yellow looking leaf, I immediately  knew the salad wasn't fresh and told the owner about it, the owner argue back saying this is how the leaf look like and considered normal, I'm a big salad eater and I know better what old and over refrigerated leaf look like, they are not fooling anybody, although the owner is nice enough to offer to prepare another one, I was also nice enough to tell them they don't need to, they also took down my review twice already, VERY SHALLOW, PRETENTIOUS, and SHADY business for sure, when it comes to review, I don't lie.  Thought about trying out BACHI HLK soon, but the way how they handle my review makes me don't even want to give them anymore of my business."}
{"text":"I don't know how much the owner paid yelp to take down my review, but I will keep on posting whenever they take down, I went there and order truffle fries, when it came out, it was soggy and cold, I immediately told them to fix it, but when they bring back, it seems they just re fry the cold batch, even though the temperature wasn't cold anymore, the fries are still soggy, I will never ever go back there, they used to be good but NOT ANYMORE, and I will ALWAYS keep on writing review when they take it down, this shows you how SHALLOW and pretentious they are.

By the way, check out the owners response to my post, my name is not even Cindy, his response doesn't even have anything with the cold fries, and it seems like he just cut and paste one of his previous response to mine, how sad is that?"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best burger place i've tried anywhere. If you're more of a traditional person, this may not be for you. For everyone else, you'll probably find the best burger you've ever had. 

I would list out my favorite things but everything I try is more delicious than the last. The things I've had and loved are the Bhan-mi burger (current fav), Miyagi-san, oxtail chili fries, pork belly buns (if you do nothing else before you die, eat these), and the chili fried chicken."}
{"text":"Great food and great service...but could you please have the radio stations in the different rooms on the same channel? It's horrible to be stuck in the crossfire!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was blown away. The food was so delicious and juicy.

We ordered the Myagi burger. It was huge enough to share. The patty was super juicy and breathtaking. Makes my mouth water when I think about it. Yummy!!! We also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries...OMG never tasted anything like this before. The portions were good with lots of chili, cheese, jalapenos, and flavor. It's also topped with fried egg. Definitely a must try.

I just found out they are opening a location in LA. Can't wait!!!

Overall, I definitely recommend this place if you are ever in Vegas. You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"The burgers there are only the tip of the ice burg of good food. The Fried Rice dish is absolutely amazing. It has bacon in it, enough said."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here a few times a month we just can't get enough... Black and green burger is the dankest mmmmm.  



If you go to the location on eastern they're
Connected to a ramen spot so well usually share the black and green burger and a bowl of ramen"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice with wifey and friends. Very busy but always good service. Tonight tried the Ox tail chili fries, was really good. Also went for the Shogun burger which has poached Asian pear amongst other things, was fantastic! This place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Awesome service and a very inviting atmosphere. The food is amazing, any burger that you get is delicious and I always supplement my entree with sweet potato truffle fries."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger, I love you!  Fusion restaurant at its best!

We ordered:

Peking Duck Steamed Buns - meat was a little dry but the hoisin sauce made it tasty

Belly Pork Steamed Buns - Really good Belly Pork and the hoisin sauce went well with it

Endamame - it's your basic endmame - probably needed salt

Oxtail Chili Fries OMG! - the best thing that ever crossed my mouth!  The wonderful oxtail stewed meat combined with the chilli beans draped over a mountain of fries with cheese.  So delicious.  Have to go back.

Next time, will try their burgers for sure."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I normally don't give bad reviews, but the experience we had at Bachi Burger is worth mentioning both for the diner's benefit and the restaurant's.

We were off to a bad start when we waited to be seated (the restaurant was almost empty) longer than we should have. Someone finally noticed us and started seating us: \"this way please, er nope, sit here, ah no, I mean there, nope nope, there sit there\"--please make up your mind and stop giving us a grand tour of the floor--we can do that after lunch. Finally, after all the confusion, the guy settled on a location and sat us down. A few more minutes of wait and our server showed up and took our order. We really didn't mind the waiting at this point so we just waited like normal people do.

After our orders came in, we noticed there weren't any napkins or utensils--basically our table was bereft of a proper table setup. Yes we know you eat burgers with your hands but we wanted to cut ours in half to cross-share, plus it's messy, plus other self-respecting restaurants do this. So we then asked a passing server/busboy if we could please get some napkins (while wiping the food off our face and hands with our hands) and at the very least a knife, he said \"surething\" and never came back. WTF. Our IDGAF server finally checks on us and we re-requested for the same napkins and knife we asked for earlier (she was appalled that we needed napkins and utensils, by the way).

So, let's get to the food review bit: the burgers are great, I forgot what we had at this point due to the irritations, but I remember it was Angus, medium well, and very juicy. Mine had the taro bun and both were suggested initially by our server which was a good thing. We also had the onion rings, which I must say is how onion rings should be done. The breading is thin and doesn't slide off when you bite into it, the flavor is savory and it's very light and crispy. The food was good enough that I almost forgot how irritated I was becoming until we had to wait again for our bill.

After our check finally came, there was another long wait for it to come back for us to sign off--our server did give us lip service that something was wrong with their system. Mmmkay. Then my wife noticed our bill was off by $6+ so she had to walk to the counter and ask our server why the price discrepancy from the check to what was charged. The bill was rectified but instead of refunding us the amount, the server says they have to charge us again and wait 48-hours for the other charge to be refunded to our bank.

At this point my wife just wanted to GTFO and leave. Yes we left gratuity because we're civil and nice people despite being treated wrongly. Will we ever come back here? Never. Will we recommend this to any of our friends or visiting relatives? Never. For a restaurant that offers premium burgers at premium prices ($12+ burgers  with no fries or drinks ain't cheap), their service sure isn't up to par. End rant, and back to Islands Hamburgers or In N Out."}
{"text":"Great ramen and great burgers. Very impressed with the quality of the burger. I would absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our party ranged in age from 11 to 57 and we were all satisfied.  We stuck to the burgers.  My cocktail was weak tho."}
{"text":"1/2 star for the mediocre pineapple ketchup and the rest is for the buttery bone marrow jam and duck butter I ordered as my entree that I devoured all to myself. The only catch is the drive to get there. If you are visiting and staying @ a hotel on the strip cab ride is close $20-30 and it took too long for a cab to come pick us up but overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"My brother and his family took me here when I was visiting them in vegas, and I saw many great reviews but was a little disappointed in the food. Maybe I had too much of a high expectation, perhaps? 

We shared the oxtail fries, which is a highly recommended item on their menu. It was okay, it honestly just tasted like spicy chili fries, and I couldn't really taste the oxtail at all (bummer)

Burgers were decent, good flavors, a little messy and hard to eat though. I believe this place is an Asian inspired burger joint so the flavors and seasoning threw me off a little. Clean and nice restaurant, the staff was pretty nice. Might come back and give it another try in the future. Down fall is that this place is off the strip."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and head over to Bachi Burger ASAP! The ingredients are so fresh, and each burger is bursting with great flavors. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Great experience and unique burgers!! This place not only has a great burger, but an extraordinary one. The theme among the burger variations focuses on Asian ingredients and the umami is strong! Bachi has also joined forces with a ramen restaurant next door, so both options are available and the menu is  is extensive. 

The Kiki burger was sampled, along with their famous salt and pepper garlic fries and a wedge salad. Fries were shoestring and cooked well, but the topping mixture was what set them apart. Fresh garlic, cilantro, and shaved jalapeños tossed with hot fries and a sprinkling of S & P really gave the potatoes a bright and zingy flavor. The wedge salad was not only good but presented creatively (see photo) and the dressing tapered homemade. The Kiki burger was awesome. While the char on the exterior of the patty was a bit overdone for my taste, the toppings on the burger were yummy and the bun was soft and tasty. Service at Bachi was excellent. The interior needs a little better upkeep and more appealing environment; i.e. table surfaces look shabby and floor not that clean. 

If you're looking for a different burger, Bachi is your place, and I will return! Hopefully, to try some ramen too..."}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE REVIEW.

First I want to address the atmosphere. At first we were like ... ehhh. I don't know. It isn't NOT nice ... it's just very simple and very small. It also was pretty dead .... at 8pm on a Friday night. So we kinda wondered if it was gong to be as good as all the reviews claimed. 
I'm so glad that we didn't let any of that stop us from dining here!

First .... food taste/quality:

No complaints here 10/10! They don't have a gluten free burger bun. So I just had the meat and toppings. But that is fine ... room for more fries!! And we tried 3 of the fries, ha.
The burger was cooked perfect and very yummy  (I had kiki but subbed waygu. that sweet onion sauce on it is SO good) and all the fries were PERFECT (we had the regular ones that have jaleps, the sweet potato fries and also the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer.) You must get the oxtail fries. So different and so good. Also the sweet potato were MUCH better than the others (that had jaleps) but they were good too! Perfectly crispy! 

Gluten Free Options/Knowledge:
They have to make your burger without some sort of sauce they normally put on all the burgers. But with so many toppings (and all the other sauces being GF) ... I certainly don't think I missed out on anything! They also let me know that they DO NOT have a dedicated fryer for the fries. They are cooked in same oil as onion rings. I decided to take the risk since I usually don't get sick from that. I may kick myself tomorrow .. but the fries were WORTH IT, ha. 

If I do end up getting sick ... I will have no way of knowing if the meal itself indeed had gluten or if it's from cross contamination. So that is why I chose to write my review now instead of later. If I get sick it will likely be my own fault for taking the risk with cross contamination! They did seem knowledgable ....so while it seems odd that some things are GF (all condiments, the chili on the oxtail fries, etc) .. because they did seem to know about gluten .. I trusted them!

I can see why this place has been voted one of the best burgers in Vegas. Burger was great .. but it was the fries that made the meal!"}
{"text":"We attempted to have dinner at 7 pm on a Friday. Upon seating, there were two tables already seated with their meal in the whole restaurant. One table was ahead of us. 20 min of sitting and the waiter finally had the drink order delivered to the table ahead of us. During our 20 min of waiting, we were never addressed by the waiter. He appeared to be the only server but had the bartender helping him. He continued to wait on the tables that already had their food including refills and such. Understanding the obvious short staff situation I tried to be patient but after 20 min without any service we left. I have never had this problem at the Sahara location. Service is always prompt and the food at Bachi is always amazing. Unfortunately this experience was unacceptable hence the one star rating."}
{"text":"Great new place, and being an out of towner, almost went nuts looking at the menu and the specials. Too many to try on a single visit. First off, the beer selection was varied but not daunting. For fries we got both the Sweet Potato and Truffle Parmesan. Truffle fries were good, almost great, except for the dip, which I thought was a mismatch (flipped the dips, I thought they fit better). We got the Ronin, Kiki and fish burgers. Wiped out. Great burgers. We thought the fish was a tad salty though. I wanted to try the Samurai burger, what with its foi gras, but decided, \"next time\". Next time also would include trying their Baos. Can't wait for my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least ten times - today was the first less than stellar meal...the Brussels sprouts were amazing as usual - but rare burger came out hockey puck style"}
{"text":"I made this visit a few months ago with a friend, so I can't remember the food entirely, just the service.

Speedy, accurate & hospitable, thank you for the staff upgrade. On our entry, we were promptly greeted & our generous hostesses had us seated right away. I say that in plural as one was in training & the other the trainer, which was very good of the \"trainer\" to inform us. 

Our very capable hostess, skated in & out of the kitchen with her pupil in tow, teaching as well as liaising between kitchen & customer. Props to the service.

I shall visit again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food, sometimes they don't have the best service but I keep coming back for the food. You can come here multiple times and try different combos
Also the best part about the restaurant it's open late."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a hidden gem.  If you are in for an adventure and are not looking to eat an everyday burger this place is a must try.  

To start the place was a little hard to find at night.  Their signage is not lit and the place is tucked in the corner of a strip mall, off the main road (Sahara).  As you enter the entrance is very dark, but you are quickly greeted with a warm welcome from multiple members of their team.  The place is clean and has an urban feel to it.  Also great service from beginning to end.

The food.  For starters we had the Oxtail Chili cheese fries.  This is a winner!  Beware: it's a large quantity so you probably should try to order a half order(not sure if they offer). If you are there to have some beers this would be the one to order.

The burgers we tried:
The Miyaji San .... its a 5Star!  We shared and both enjoyed.

The Kalbi burger was underwhelming .... was more like a Teri glazed burger.  Could be it just wasn't for us.  

We'll be back.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and when we travel to Vegas next year, we'll bring our friends and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for dinner and my friend was so surprised that I haven't been here yet. We got here around 6 on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. There seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in after that.  Service was alright....it did take quite some time to get our food, but for the most part since we knew that the service was bad we made it a point to get what we needed whenever we saw the server.  On to the good stuff....

I decided to order the duck steamed bun. Who doesn't get a burger at a burger joint right? Well I had Arby's for lunch and I didn't feel like a burger. I liked it except for the mint and the fact that the duck was a bit tough to eat. The egg didn't bother me like it did some yelpers. If you are REALLY hungry I would dissuade anyone from ordering this. Luckily, I wasn't too hungry so it filled me up just fine. My friend decided on the Blue and Green Burger. I got to try and bite and I thought it was pretty good. Bacon, mushrooms, blue cheese, veggies and meat....I was impressed with the size of the burger. Good flavors overall. I decided to also try these infamous truffle Parmesan fries.....they were really good; however, next time I come back I will be getting the sweet potato fries. Yes, I will be returning for a burger next time....maybe...the pork belly caught my eye too."}
{"text":"I love Bachi Burger! It's been one of my favorite eateries in Vegas and it's on my side of town! We've been here a couple of times already and I think I've gotten the same thing both times...Kiki Burger. Their burgers are pretty big, I always have to share with my husband who does finish up his burger quite nicely. The last time I wanted to try the oxtail fries again, it was definitely a lot better than the first time we had it, but a bit spicy for this preggo. 

Service is a bit better at this location then the other one and we've never had to wait for a table yet! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. The food is generally good. Our server was really great. But, the kitchen was the problem.  It took 44 minutes after ordering for the first of two burgers to arrive. I ordered it done medium and it arrived well done, the edges charred. The second of two burgers arrived 46 minutes after ordering. It was done right though."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place after reading such great reviews from my friends. They did not disappoint me. I came here with my bf and friend and we ordered the Ronin burger and Kiki burger. I loved the Kiki burger. The meat was of excellent quality and I loved the sauteed variety of mushrooms and onions. The Truffle Parmesan fries are fabulous! I love the truffle sauce drizzled on top. It came with a unique sauce, a great variation from your typical ketchup. The Sweet Potato fries were good too. Don't forget to order the Strawberry Lemonade, which is the best I've ever had. They puree strawberries and mix it in the lemonade. Delish!"}
{"text":"The bun and the creative burgers with quirky names assigned to them. Bachi Burger is always a good go-to place. Glad the Summerlin location is getting better though.
My experience at the \"new\" westside location was never as good as the more popular and more seasoned one so my wife and I gave them some slack. This is probably our 5th visit and I must say, that things are always improving. I just wish the serving staff were better at upselling, explaining, etc... But all in all, great place to eat a good burger"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place because the menu is so promising, but the experience was less than pleasing from the moment we walked in the door.  We walked in an I cannot help but complain about the smell of sewage as we walked in the door.  I'm not being hyperbolic - I honestly think I smelled sewage.  We asked to be seated outside but they were not serving outside so we sat as close to the windows as possible.  It seemed to help and we were really craving burgers so we stayed.

The only saving grace was our waiter - he was very polite and did a fantastic job.  We ordered a couple of beers, the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the black & green burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries.  The burgers were ok, not horrible but not even close to worth the price ($13 or so).  The fries were also pretty good but again, nothing special.

I would give them another chance just because, again, the menu has so much promise and maybe they just had an off night, but the food is going to have to be really great in order to get me to consider becoming a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Ok so first time here and we ordered the bachi pickles which is actually an assortment of different veggies including habanero peppers which was not a welcome addition... After having a mouths burned off for 20 minutes we had truffle fries which are quite good. We both got the myogi San burger but I asked to substitute the onion rings because I can't eat them. Unfortunately they do not do substitutes and charge which I did but still not good business in my opinion... The waitress we had was quite impersonal and rude... We would ask for something and she would roll her eyes and walk off. Other then that the burgers were beautif and delicious.


UPDATE:
So since going here last night I have become pretty sick... I'm assuming due to that stupid pepper that some genius decided to put on an appetizer plate with the title Pickles! BEWARE"}
{"text":"The food was really great. I had a few different kinda of fries and had the Ranin burger and KiKi burger. The Kiki burger was is something I would recommend. Although two people were after us and got our food first was only the bad part and it took them a while."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing!! Enjoyed the atmosphere, this place will definitely be a place that I frequent quite often!"}
{"text":"Just an update.  Waiting to be seated now and frustrated at the poor service already. Called at 6:33 and said we were on our way in. Was told they'd put our name on the list but when we got there it wasn't and it's now 7:00 and we're not seated.  Had to show my phone to the receptionist to prove I called then she double checked because maybe I called the wrong place? (Like some other restaurant has my name on the list)?) they could open a new section for us but refuse? All to say... Starting on the wrong foot AGAIN.  Hope server improves our experience.


--  

Update.   Seated with good waiter. Live has been rebalanced."}
{"text":"My beef burger of choice is The Miyagi San, because it caters to my personal palette. Like Wylie Dufresne when he meets a perfect egg and Anthony Bourdain when he eats that perfect egg. The moment is in the egg on top, people. On that note, you can add a fried egg onto any burger because they're so cool they totally let you add and even substitute. 

You can also create your own burger which is fun with so much quality ingredients. My man like this option. 

Also favorites: The Ronin and The Kiki. 

But my number one favorite is \"The Lonely Bird\". Or \"The Bird\" as I order it, a turkey and chicken burger and I add on bacon because their bacon is maple. Not lonely anymore. 

These guys are consistent and the burgers are always cooked to your exact order. I've never once had to send my burger back. They're huge by the way, and damn expensive."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite burger in Vegas! I don't even go for the fusion burgers (which are incredible) but rather a purists' version. Wagyu beef with cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato, and ketchup. Simple but sweet and a classic all the way! Why mess with perfection?

The burgers are always cooked on point here. I fluctuate between med rare and rare, and the fact that each time I switch it up and can tell the difference is a testament to the deft hands working the grill back there. The beef itself is pure, juicy, fatty indulgence. Add quality cheddar? A masterpiece. The buns here really set it over the top- a Taiwanese style sweetbread that's crunchy against the patty and veggies but supple on top, so that it melds itself around the rest of the burger.

If that's not enough to bring you in, the Bachi pickles should be. With a great variety of about 6, each made in house, it's such a great way to start- and end!- the meal, especially with its digestive properties. Crunchy sweet garlic, bracing daikon, vibrant radishes.. The rotation changes on any given day.

Out of all the fries, the salt and pepper are my favorite garnished with fresh leaves of cilantro, thinly sliced jalapeños and fried ginger. I love it with the Yuzu aioli.

Endless matcha iced green teas, a great beer selection, creative desserts- there isn't a reason for you not to drop by."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Been here about 6 times and every single time the service is terrible just AWFUL! I came at a time where there were only 4 tables busy which had their food already and yet somehow the waistress kept getting lost , took forever to take our order and never asked if we needed anything . Who hires these people! I think being lazy, slow and giving zero shits about customer service is a requierement to work here."}
{"text":"I tried the black and green burger. The blue cheese was overwhelming. I didn't enjoy it. There was also so many flies flying around and landing on me and our food. My son loved his burger. And we both enjoyed the salt & pepper garlic fries. And I really enjoyed my Plantation Style Sweet Tea."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to Vegas and love a good burger.  We live close to this location and had been excited about trying this restaurant.  We have 2 children under 3 so one day when they were napping I ran over to get 2 burgers to-go.

I placed my order and after 15 minutes of waiting I started to wonder how long it would take.  At 20 minutes I started getting a little annoyed.  After 25 minutes I was standing in front of the counter clearly a little ticked and nobody said anything to me.  I finally received my take-out and the general manager handed me the bag and didn't even say anything.  I looked at the receipt and it took 27 minutes!

I have worked at high and low end restaurants and NOTHING takes that long, not even a well-done steak.  All we ordered was a regular burger done medium and veggie burger.  Any manager with minimal customer service skills should have realized at 15 minutes it was taking too long and he was up there looking at the order tickets the whole time.

In addition, my wife said her burger was undercooked of all things and mine was average at best.  

I was so disappointed that I wrote them an email on their website and they didn't even bother to respond.

Perhaps their food is better if you eat in but I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this business and how they run things, especially not having enough class to write me back, that I fear that will never happen.  So very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you like going to clubs, you will love this place. If you value good service, a friendly attitude, really good food, and a good value, go somewhere else.

This is a classic case of poor management. Both times I went there, we found tables available, but were told to wait 15-20 minutes.

The first time, I had a plane to catch. By the time I was seated, and they finally came over to take our order, I had to leave.

The second time, I gave them a chance. Long wait, and by the time one of the \"hip\" waitresses came over, the ice in my soft drink had melted. 

The burgers were decent, but honestly, there is a Japanese Burger truck that goes to various locations. It's a lot better, a lot more fun, and better priced. 

As I said before, the crowd that goes here seems really \"in\" and \"trendy\", and act like they are sitting at VIP Tables in a Club.  The waitresses act like they are cocktail waitresses at a club. The management thinks they are really cool.

If they had a product that justified this arrogant attitude, fine. My wife thought they had great Sweet Potato Fries. That's about it."}
{"text":"Their burgers taste different from any burger joint. I really enjoyed every bite of their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries & Kiki's Burger. I love, love, love it. It's a MUST taste restaurant."}
{"text":"There's nothing pretentious about bachi burger.  The burgers are at a minimum some of the best burgers I've ever had, if not the best, but that may lead to inflated expectations if you go  there so let's just agree to say they are really good burgers.

I got the miyagi something burger.  It was a wagyu beef patty with a fried egg, onion rings, chili mayo, and caramelized bacon.  The temperature of the burger was spot on, medium with a nice, warm pink center.  The egg was cooked perfectly as well, over-easy with a nice runny yolk.

The bun, an often unappreciated component of the burger, was soft, flavorful and appropriate in size (good mean to bun ratio) and absorbed all of the juices from the wagyu beef.

For sides, we did the oxtail chili fries and the truffle fries.  Truffle fries seem to be the new en vogue thing now, so I was not blown away by them (they were pretty good though), but the oxtail chili fries embodied what I would think of when I think of a marriage of Asian cuisine with american junk food.  There are generous portions of oxtail (unlike Animal in LA who chinsy oxtail poutine was somewhat disappointing).

In short, if you're willing to trek off the strip in vegas in search of a good burger, go to this place, you probably won't be disappointed, unless you're a charlatan."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger can be really good; then again, sometimes it isn't. Consistency doesn't seem to be something I get from this place.

I've been here twice so far. First time, I got the turkey burger. It wasn't very good. It had a flavor that was really strong (not in a good way), which probably put its sodium through the roof. Plus, I couldn't stand the minty sauce that came with it. Thankfully, I got to sample the Ronin burgers that my buddies ordered, which were delicious. Second time, I went for the miso burger. The sauce that it was marinated in overpowered the dry burger completely. It was almost like it was doused in soy sauce. A complete mediocre meal. It didn't help that the matcha green tea that I ordered smelled like sea water. Almost made me nauseous.

Not sure if I want to come back to this place again for a third chance. It's rare that I walk out of a restaurant angry. I walk in expecting something wonderful from the raving words that I hear about this place. 2 out of 2 times I was disappointed. The second visit was far more worse than the first, though I must admit that the service was consistently good.

Who knows? Maybe I just ordered wrong during my visits. I hate that these items even exist on the menu to tempt me. There shouldn't be any \"wrong\" items to order on a menu in the first place."}
{"text":"This is my second time here since 3 years ago.  Came with a group of people.  There food is great, but a tad salty.  I had the Big Fish burger and the others had their specialty burgers.  The ramen is not bad too. The service is good."}
{"text":"This isn't the great Bachi burger that we all remember. It's completely changed in terms of service and quality of food served. It's very sad because I've visited 3x over the last year and half and it's been the same poor service and quality each time. I'm completely heartbroken over this because I always used to bring guests Bachi Burger. I honestly won't ever come back again. The evening began with getting seated in the ramen room. They were cooking something like onion or something spicy. Everyone seated in the room was literally in tears from whatever they were cooking.  Server brought some of our drinks then just disappeared. The meal was as follows: garlic edamame with no flavor. We sent them back. She had them remade but they came out with so much salt that we were cringing while eating them. Both batches were the same. We didn't bother sending them back because it wasn't worth the hassle. We asked for our fries and burgers to come out at the same time. Our fries came out 10 minutes before and were cold. The burgers finally came out and were  just warm. The eggs in two of our burgers were overcooked. The other person helping the waiter brought our desserts WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING.  it was the most bizarre thing ever. We told them to take them back until we were done. Finally when we ask for the desserts again, we asked for a candle. The waiter said they were out of candles and they didn't sing happy birthday . Okay fine, that's not a huge deal. It's a bit weird, but i won't hold that against them. The food, however,  was bad as was the service. It honestly pains me to write this because I truly loved Bachi burger, but this is the 3rd time we have had bad service and bad food so I feel it's my responsibility to let people know that Bachi Burger is no longer a good place to eat..."}
{"text":"Incredible burgers! The Kiki burger is knee jerking good. Run, don't walk, and go get one now!!"}
{"text":"Why must you be all the way in Vegas?! Wish I could try everything on there menu because every morsel of food I tried when I was there was a party in my mouth. The service was great too. At first, the hostess and I were not seeing eye to eye because some group got sat before us but the whole thing was sorted out and we got sat ASAP. Would return here in a heart beat. I'm sure everything is great but the oxtail fries and the pork belly sliders were my fav!"}
{"text":"Oh Bachi Booboo, you are a delight!
Nestled in a strip mall off Windmill (my location of choice), you find a petite but happy lil place. The staff is oober friendly and excited to talk to you about their menu and Television debut.  My friend drooled over the oxtail chili fries, my husband loved everything his taste buds touched and they accomodated me with Vegetarian options.

Good stuff y'all!!  Happy Belly."}
{"text":"This is the original location and I enjoy their burgers and fries. The menu has increased since years ago, but I have many favorites that I eat here.
Today I had the Shogun and the Fish burger. The Shogun is the best when you feel like eating pan fried goose liver with your burger. The Fish burger is made from a cod with a miso paste flavor that I use to eat in Hawaii all the time. Truffles and Plain fries with pineapple ketchup and aioli sauces are so yummy with the burgers. 
Perfectly cooked burgers and fries with a Sauvignon Blanc on my lunch break, just nice!  Service is always friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This place is delis! The wait was a tad long but worth it! I looooove their Banh Mi burger!

Service was great too!

The server mentioned they're opening up two locations in SoCal...I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"I love Bachi..all burgers have their own unique taste Oxtail chili cheese fries and sweet potato fries is really good too."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it.
Burger just wasnt up to par to other gourmet burger places. Taste in beef lacking. 
Service was also poor on the day we went"}
{"text":"Was In Vegas for the week. Saw this place when watching Guy on Diner, Drives, & Dives. Had to try it...tried the Bachi 7 oz burger, the \"Banh mi\" burger, the pork belly bao, the oxtail chili cheese fries, the PB milkshake, and the apple lychee soda. Total cost was around $57. 

Bachi burger was good! I think it was a brioche bun toasted creating a crust on the inner buns...sandwiched with red onions, lettuce, tomato, and the pattie that also had a nice crust to it and meat was still juicy. I kept telling my hubby that that's how I liked my burgers. 

\"Banh mi\" was almost the same, minus the tomatoes and onion. In place was the usual pickled carrot and white veggie and fresh cut (although it was freshly cut) jalepenos on the side. Not much difference compared to the Bachi burger, but I preferred the Bachi burger.

Pork belly bao was good. I was expecting more from the pork belly, but I guess not. Just your typical cut of pork belly dipped in sauce thrown with a few leaves of lettuce and a slice of egg between the buns. Small and cute, but eh.

Oxtail chili cheese fries were Chilli cheese fries! The Chilli was overpowering and you couldn't enjoy the taste of true oxtail. (Because oxtail is super good by itself already!) The fresh thinly sliced jalapeños were a good garnish and created a kick to it! And there was a sprinkling of chopped cilantro.

The PB milkshake was good. I'm just not a big fan of PB like that. But the quantity for the cost of $6 was not worth it. Think of it like a $6 TALL milkshake (YES, LIKE AT STARBUCKS...OR SMALL EVERY WHERE ELSE).

And the apple lychee...it's apple lychee...not a taste you find everyday...but it was $4! (Perhaps 12 fluid oz size served in a long/tall (longer than a straw) skinny glass (because the straw sunk in the glass and you had to pull it back out in order to sip).

By the way, place was packed. Place just combined with the Ramen next door, so there was 3 total menus in front of you: bachi, ramen,  and a drinks menu. 

Service: had to wait for table,  but it was quick. Had to wait for waiter. Waiter didn't come by to check up on food or drinks; only checked on drinks once towards the end. And it took a while for check to be brought after we had already finished dinner.

I would go back for the burgers; probably nothing else though, but who knows!"}
{"text":"OMG the best burgers!!!!  And I'm not even kidding.  Service was great too, not sure what everyone else is moaning about.  Our waitress was prompt, knew her food and was very friendly.  But what got us what the amazing food!  My party LOVED my burger the best, which was the Spicy Miso Burger, which was a special that night.  My friend orgered the Ronin and my other friend ordered the Kiki burger.  My sister ordered the steamed buns w/short ribs.  All was very good, and we ordered the truffle/parmesan and sweet potatoe fries to share.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate hazelnut cookie ice cream and the strawberry beignets.  Also great!  I love their creative and Asian inspired menu.  They put a lot thought in their presentation and what to add in their burgers and other menu items.  I wanted to try everything!  This was our first time and we are definitely coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER in town bar none! A little pricey but worth it. Service is slow because it's SO busy! Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Having experienced Japanese/American fusion burgers before (fist to chest bump with two fingers kissed in the sky for you B Man's) I still thought that the food at Bachi Burger was fresh, innovative and most importantly, delicious.  Bookending our first Vegas trip together, mi corazon was absolutely adamant that we stop by this restaurant on our way back to LA...  which made the 8 hour drive back home somewhat more palatable...  somewhat.  :T  More on that later.  

And on a related note, I firmly think that the mindlessly reckless drivers that one invariably encounters on the long stretch of road between the IE and Las Vegas are terrible people...  and if they crash their cars in the median due to their utter stupidity, they should be left to their own devices.  

With that said, Corazon immediately declared to all within earshot that she had decided on the Shogun burger.  I'd like to think that it was her sense of good taste and high breeding (after all, she is dating me!)  that led her to choose the delightful mix of American wagyu, unagi, foie gras and other accoutrements and not the fact that it was by far the most expensive item on the menu at $25.

\"25 Dollars!\" I mentally screamed to myself in shock and awe at the price tag of the appropriately named \"Shogun\".  \"Well, two can play at that game\" I told myself as I prepared to use my most persuasive tone normally reserved for dealing with irrational minorities and sleazy car salesmen.

Me:  \"Hey sweetie, great choice on the Shogun.  I was thinking, I'm not really that hungry.  Maybe we should just share the burger and get an order of the oxtail fries.  I saw another table order them and they're so big.\"  *inwardly snickering at circumventing an astronomical bill*

Corazon:  *small voice*  OK, we can do that...  but it's suuuuch a goood buuuurgerrrrr...  *heartfelt sigh along with sad eyes looking off into the distance a la Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind*

Needless to say, dear readers, I ended up ordering a burger for myself and mi corazon happily partook in her Shogun burger.  To add further insult to the injury that I am a chumo that gets swayed by sad eyes and a cute face:  I would ask for nibbles of her delicious burger and she'd purposely put her fingers really high up on the bun, effectively funneling my bites between her delicate fingers at 15-20% of normal bite capacity.  In response, I angrily accused her of culinary stinginess, but she responded with a heartfelt denial coupled again with sad eyes, and I just gave up the ghost...  $85, dear readers, for a couple of burgers and fries.  Still, I'd like to think the look of sheer bliss on mi corazon's face was worth it.  

To also take the sting out of the bill, I made sure to hoard 80% of the delicious oxtail/aoili topping on the fries, as well scarfing down my 1500 calorie burger and a tall 22 oz bottle of Dogfish Head Pilsner.  And as we walked back to the car, ready to make the 280 mile trip back to LA, I tapped her on the shoulder, broke out my saddest eyes and asked her, \"Sweetie, I'm really tired.  Can you drive?\" and hopped into the passenger seat and promptly fell asleep.

Best $85 I ever spent."}
{"text":"It must have been mile 5 or so of the Spartan Super Race when I started to really curse myself for what I got into. Hungry, tired, hot and cold (yes, it's possible), and with a leg that kept cramping. That's when a large group came up behind me encouraging each other. \"Do it for Bachi Burger!\" \"ohhh.. yeaa.. Bachi Burger\".. \"mmm\" and all kind of positive responses ensued. Curious, I asked, what is this Bachi Burger and where can I get it. The reviews there and on yelp ended up being great, so we decided to make sure we checked it out before we left Vegas. 

It did not disappoint. First, we ordered the oxtail fries. Yes, I know it sounds strange and not necessarily appealing. But wow! It was really good! The fries were not soggy, the oxtail super tender and they added a fried egg on top. And I really really love a fried egg. Got to try the garlic truffle fries and those were good too. For the burger, I tried the Ronin burger. I enjoyed the quality of the beef and the mix of different and unique flavors. Friends also tried their shakes and really enjoyed them. Definitely a good find! I am excited to see they have opened locations in LA and Pasadena!"}
{"text":"I never had a burger that had so many different flavors and tasted absolutely perfect.  I usually get the spicy miso burger, which isn't that spicy at all but taste wonderful. I also have had Banh Mi and Kiki burger as well.  The fries are pretty good, not a big fan of salt and pepper in general but the sliced jalapeno's are always fresh.  The fries are big enough to share but the burger by itself is perfect for a meal on its own.

Oh and i love photos that they have up from Japan and that they play they usually play a food/cooking show on the tv."}
{"text":"First time in this branch since they changed from Bachi HLK (Healthy Life Kitchen).
We always liked Bachi Burgers  but the visit in this particular  branch is quite disappointing. 

We started with truffle fries which was very good and crispy. The flavor of the truffle comes through. It's an all time favorite. 

Grilled kurobota sausages were juicy and tender and comes with honey mustard dipping sauce. 

My little one got the grilled cheese with bacon and egg sandwich which was pretty good but the apple slices that come with it were inedible like it has been soaked in some type of un identified nasty solution. 

I got the Shogun burger with unagi and foie gras - the burger itself was cooked well and juicy, but somehow the combination with the unagi does not work. The unagi was not fresh, overly sweet, dry and has an unpleasant fishy taste leaving a weird after taste. For a $26 burger, at least make it decent enough to eat. That was such a disappointment.  

Hubby got the Miyagi Burger which he really liked. Fried onion burger toppings although greasy were crispy. 

The GOOD:
Pineapple ketchup is our favorite, love it with the fries. 
Truffle fries were always a hit. 
The BAD & UGLY: 
Service is so-so. It does take a long while before they take your orders. 
Apple that goes with kid's meal tastes weird.
Shogun burger as described above is not worth the $26 I shelled out.  Nasty flavor."}
{"text":"Just ate a Bacchi Burger and would never go back.  I am not a huge burger fan so I ordered the crab which was so fishy with more filler than crab.  My friend ordered the Kiki burger which was delicious.  I asked to order something else and by the time I received it, was not that hungry so got it to go.  When we were presented with the check our bill for 2 burgers/ fries was 56.00!!!  I noticed they didn't take the crab off and when questioned was told that the chef tasted it and thought it was fine and that was their policy not to credit any food item just because you didn't like it.  I told the manager she should have told me before she reordered another item for me and if I have to pay for it I wanted to take it home, of course it was thrown out.  She then proceeded to lecture me about their food policy.  It seems to me when you are charging extra for an additional tablespoon of sauce and burgers and fries are 50.00 for 2 people you should get what you want without being lectured from the manager!!!  The burgers were ok but not worth the hassle and price.  Islands Burgers just as good, less expensive, and better customer service.  If the manager would  have stopped at crediting the crab cake; I would not be writing this.... Is a 13.00 burger worth this??"}
{"text":"I went back and actually got pretty decent service. Although I think I'm just too white trash and not enough hipster for this sort of place

My burger and drink ended up costing something like $19.  Ridiculous.  At Red Robin for around $12 you can get a burger, all-you-can-eat steak fries, and a drink.

The fries here are little tiny shoestring things that don't taste anything like potatoes.  What's the point?  I want steak fries dammit.

The bun is this weird sugary glazed dinner roll type thing.  It confuses my mouth."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink. Got a blood Mary. Omg the glasses are way to huge, there was so much liquid I couldn't even drink half of it. At least there was enough alcohol. But no salted rim, no garnish other than a lime. Just store bought Bloody Mary mix and vodka. I could have done better at home for sure. One plus the bartender was really cool."}
{"text":"Crazy good food and quite reasonable pricing!

I had the shogun burger with the foie gras waygu and unagi. Awesome.
Wife had the Mr Ho's...also very tasty.
And the Ox tail fries...to die for.

My only negatives. The hostess didn't seem like she wanted to be there, and we suspect they gave our order of fries to the fresh ups that just sat down at the bar next to us, even though we waited longer. 

Other than that, it seemed the manager on the floor was on his game, rectified the situation, and was genuinely happy to have us there as guests."}
{"text":"I don't believe in 1 star or 5 star ratings, yet this is like a 4.9 ish haha.  Overall for even some of the younger employees, they're prompt and professional.  The burgers at any Bachi hits the spot and tastes well.  I like the different tracks they use for the music.  This one in particular has a joint menu with Shoku Ramen next door so yeah, that's pretty sweet.  Ramen if you change your mind and the bar offers some decent drink choices for those wanting some brew or hard liquor.

My favorite Bachi Burger spot for sure, if amongst my favorite places in vegas"}
{"text":"I've been on the search for the best burger in Vegas, and have failed a many times. But I have finally found my fave burger in VEGAAAAAAS!!!! WOOooooooo!

IT's the KIKI BURGER. The flavors are amazing. I didn't think I was going to like it, so I ordered a kalbi burger, while my friend ordered the kiki. And I am so glad she got this so that I can walk away in peace, knowing where to come back when I want to stuff my face with the amazingness of burger heaven. 

I personally am a huge fan of a burger tasting closer to a classic burger, but to the next level due to something special. If that's you, then the kiki burger will satisfy your needs. The kalbi burger, on the other hand, would be enjoyable for one that really likes fusion flavors. I love korean food, and korean flavors, but for some reason, I've noticed that I don't like it when it's combined with other food types (like burgers, tacos, burritos, sushi, etc.) 

Fried Calamari- 4/5 Pretty dang good. The breading is on the lighter side, which I love, but I've had better. I can't complain that it comes with different type of veggies, and the sauce was amaaaaaaazing. 

Service was ON POINT, but they can get a busy so you'll have to waive down a waiter for your water/drinks to be refilled. I'll have to come back and check out the HH some time."}
{"text":"Well def slightly overrated but worth a try. Burgers were juicy and petite. Atmosphere was average. Servers were polite and efficient. DONT get oxtail chili cheese fries. I had a few drinks in me and usually like anything in front of me. Fries/oxtail super salty and gross.. Hormel chili in the can blows this crap away.. Pass"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger... what happened... When you first opened years ago, you were a hip fun addition to Vegas. You increased the number of restaurants, for good reason, but the quality seems to have gone down. 
Kiki burger, spicy miso burger. Spicy miso was a strange combination. Kiki burger was better. Both sounded great on paper, but both were disappointing. 
Garlic fries were dry and sprinkled with light garlic. The aioli sauce that came with it was good, but nothing special. I wanted a wet drenched in garlic fry... ugh. 
The restaurant is large and in a popping plaza."}
{"text":"Celebrating for Spartan Race we wanted to reward ourselves. Assuming everything in The Strip would be packed for dinner we decided to try avoiding the chaos and thought Bachi Burger wouldn't be packed...we were semi-correct. A decent wait for some delicious food.

Ambiance: 
* Parking | It is plaza parking so it is quite busy.
* Seating | A fair amount of seating, about 50-70 people bar or group seating.
* Feels | Typical restaurant feel with trance/electric music and definitely always crowded.

Food:
Caramel Milkshake | Sweet and caramelly. The smoothie smoothly went through the straw and was enjoyable with every strip
Red Velvet Milkshake | The concept of red velvet is overrate but even I gave in. No regrets delicious it was. 
Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries | Definitely a unique taste with the oxtail, egg, cheese and the additional appetizers. This is plentiful so do share.
Truffle Parmesan Fries |  Typical yet delicious truffle parmesan fries. If you are in the mood for something lighter, go for this.
Banh Mi Burger | Where to begin? The delicious mix of pork, shrimp and vinegar just to name a few made these american feel into a good asian fusion.
Mr. Ho's Burger | The sausage and mushrooms were delicious, juicy, and had awesome texture.

Customer Service:
* We waited for about 20-30 minutes. It's strange we walked us in and escorted us to the back patio to wait where we just sat and listened to trance/electric music. Other than that the servers were attentive and fixed my order when there was a problem, no charge!

Overall: 
* 5 stars. A very unique burger place, I can't think of any place. The wait was fairly respectable and worth it. The customer service was excellent and the food was unforgettably delicious: the creative marinations and combinations of lemongrass, fish sauce, pickled vegetable just to name a few... I would definitely come back and try their other menu items. Till next time, Bachi Burger!


Advice:
* Come during non-common business ours."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, that were both cooked and seasoned perfectly. The prices were a little bit on the expensive side for a burger, but it is not too much more than you would pay for a burger at any other sit down restaurant. The one area where they excel over other places is that they cook the burgers to your liking, but also have other foods that most sit down burger places wouldn't off. Additionally they have some incredible in house fruit flavored sodas.

The feel is not too bad, but it would be way better if it was located elsewhere, and not in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a five star review. I did. 

We arrived and waited 10 minutes before being seated, even though there were open seats and no one else waiting. It looked like the dining room was understaffed. 

We were taken to our table, and it only had one chair, so I had to snag a char from another table. 

It took forever to have our order taken and while our waitress was taking our order, another waiter came up and interrupted her with us to tell her something. 

We got the oxtail chili cheese fries on a recommendation from a friend and it was phenomenal. 

The waitress didn't clear the plates right away though, so the table was pretty full. 

I got a BBQ Bachi burger with onion rings and cheddar cheese, and that too, was phenomenal. 

Food = Awesome
Service = Poor

Because of the many service issues, a five-star review turns into...

Three ***"}
{"text":"This was a great burger place but the quality of their food went down. I ordered two burgers, And both were not good at all. The bun felt like it was microwaved too long because it was hard and rubbery. The meat for both burgers were burnt and hard. Not rubbery hard, but tough hard. The egg in one of the burgers was actually cooked good but everything else was bad."}
{"text":"Lunch is always our first agenda when my sister comes to town.  Bachi Kitchen was a big hit!  We were greeted and sat immediately.  Drinks quickly ordered and served, we decided to split Kale Salad and Ronin burger (minus the bun).  The salad was delicious even before the yummy yuzu dressing  was added.  Perfect combination with quinoa, goat cheese, cranberries, butternut squash bits, and avocado.  The burger was so juicy and flavorful, with sweet onions and fried egg.  I ate the tasty gingery nutty cole slaw as a side.  Our servers were so friendly and on point!  Will go back for their all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars... Wait was tooo long, service wasn't too great, drinks weren't good, it got quite smokey in the restaurant... the only thing they really had going for them was the food! 

We came here on our way home from vegas. Yes we could've gone somewhere else when we heard it would be an hour wait, but we decided to stick it out, because if we had gone anywhere else, it would've been the same.  I was referred here by a co-worker. 

We had the Oxtail chili cheese fries, which we alright, you don't really taste the oxtail, it's a bit sweeter, than just regular chili fries. 

We also had the Waygu and Black & Green Burgers. Which were delicious! I have to say the best part of our experience here. The drinks were watered down. Even though it wasn't that busy by the time we got our tables, it took a while for us to get our servers attention.  Even with the vents on, it got really smokey inside the restaurant too. 

Overall it was alright, would i go back? Yeah, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, oxtail chilli Fries and miyagi burger are the best one there. It's a lil pricy but worth every penny. Love this place."}
{"text":"I love this Bachi Burger! Well, i love them all, but this location is so intimate and usually very quiet, unlike the other busier locations. Location aside, i am obsessed with their food. Everything i've tried i ended up loving. I usually do the 'create your own burger', where you can add condiments and toppings to your choosing. I also always get the truffle fries, which are so so so amazing. The service is fairly speedy, everyone is friendly, and i enjoy coming here often to eat. 
There is a bit of a downside, however. It seems there is usually a *minor* problem each time we come to visit. For example, i asked for a well-done burger and i get a rare burger. Or i ask if we can split the check between two people and they forget to do it. When i ask them to correct it, we verify what i've bought and what my friend bought and they still manage to mess it up. Again, they are minor mistakes but still a little irritating considering it's never overwhelmingly busy to keep making mistakes. 
However, if you want to try a great burger with new and interesting flavors, you should definitely check this place out. I love it!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of Bachi Burger, it's a neat little hangout although a little crammed. The food here is impeccable to other burger joints. I'm very pleased to see they have a turkey burger to satisfy those who do not like the traditional red meat burgers. Also, do yourself a favor and engulf yourself in their french fries although be cautious they bring out a lot! I would also recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Had a great pre dinner with great aps and main course. A bottle of wine and life was good. Not too long of a line but be prepared to wait most of the time. Worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to tell you right now: try to avoid the windmill location if you're not wanting to wait more than 10 minutes for a table LOL. we went to the windmill location first, and were told it would be an hour+ wait to be seated, so we headed over to this sahara location for a 5-10 minute wait.

it definitely was worth the drive away from the strip. we had the black & green and kiki's burgers, with the oxtail chili fries. BOMB! the burgers were so juicy! and the waiter we had was very helpful and blunt in a good way. He definitely didn't sugar coat anything when recommending or (talking down) certain items on the menu. I really liked that, because it was a little more personal, and not so pushy on selling the high priced items. 

I only wish there were more Asian fusion places similar to this in colorado."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 
Steiners, the rudest bar in vegas, told us we could stay there for burgers so we came here and my god it was good. I regret all the bad things I said. Salt and pepper fries, sweet potato fries, the waugi?-San( the one with crispy onions) and my boyfriend had the one with shiitake mushrooms. The wait was really long but the moment I took the first bite it was all worth it. We ate in silence it was that good. Really the best burger in vegas, so perfect in every way. Flavor, sauce, texture, juiciness. Maybe I just got the wrong burger, or maybe it was because I got it to go? All I know is I'll be back for you, bachi!!!! 

Picture is featuring a fish burger that I had when I was a pescatarian and it is hands down the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love everything at Bachi burger! Fusion burgers at its finest. Although not a cheap burger in town ( average burger around $16) it is worth every penny. You can't go wrong ordering any of their burgers, however my personal favorite is the sho gun burger with wagyu beef, foie grad, unagi, poached pears. Their beef is high quality and your can taste the difference. Their truffle fries with porcini cream sauce are to die for, and their oxtail chili cheese fries a hit with anyone I bring here, and I love their calamari. Their presentation and quality is very consistent and I am always happy with the service. They also offer freshly made milkshakes, adult milkshakes, and a variety of other fun beverages. If that wasn't enough they also offer ramen. My favorite ramen dish is the tan tan man. Packed full of flavor and has a nice kick but not too spicy."}
{"text":"The miyagi burger was pretty good. My favorite part was the crispy onion rings. The price is decent considering how big the portion is. 

The wait/service was not so hot. It took almost as long to get our appetizers as it did our food. Food was good but I don't think it was worth all that wait to be honest."}
{"text":"The food was so good I wanted to come back for dinner the next night! Alas, we already had reservations elsewhere, so I will have to settle for dreaming about our next visit. 

We started with the truffle fries (good flavor and a nice dipping sauce), garlic fries (no garlic, lots of jalapeños, I was confused), and onion rings (best I've ever tasted- seriously).  

I got the banh mi burger which was delicious, although I didn't realize the shrimp would be ground into the beef patty. As a result, I didn't taste any shrimp flavor at all. However, this burger didn't lack for overall flavor in the slightest. I also tried my husband's (?) burger and son's Kiki burger. Both were great. 

We finished the meal with the salted caramel shake with toasted marshmallow topping. I don't care for salted caramel desserts, but this wasn't too salty, so I enjoyed it. 

Overall, we had a great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Very delish pork buns! Definitely a must try.

Prepare to be stuffed! The burgers are huge. Was really glad that I shared with a friend."}
{"text":"Recently ate here with a few friends and it was great! Paul and Adrian helped us out and they were both really nice and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed. I got the bachi fish burger and we shared some oxtail fries. Everything was so bomb and I'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Was excited to finally try Bachi Burger BUT was very disappointed. Maybe it's just this location (on W. Sahara) but the service was horrible!!! Walked in around 7:15pm on a Friday night. Left side of the restaurant had 8 tables open and another 7 or 8 tables open on the right side but was told the wait time to be seated was 10-15min, not sure why when there were at least 7 staff members on the floor. Then a couple who arrived after us got seated first.

Finally got seated (must mention another couple left after waiting for so long to be seated) and we told the server our orders of what we wanted. Our appetizer arrived along with my green tea but then never got a refill or even offered another cup although it was bottomless tea. The couple who got seated after us, got their appetizer and half way through that they received their burgers -WTF?! Seen 4 burgers on the pass and none of them delivered to us after waiting another 15-20min. Sad thing is that our burgers were the simplest ones to make, and we got deliver the wrong fries. Our server never came to our table to check on us until it was time to give us the check.

NEVER going to this place again!"}
{"text":"This could have been a home run.
My friends and I got many different things so we could share. 
Loved the oxtail fries. 
Really liked the wings - wished they had more heat.
Also liked the duck filled steamed buns. 
Absolutely hated the James beard award winning lamb burger - one bite and I couldn't eat anymore. It was terrible! 
I would have given them a higher rating had it not been for that burger. 

Oh, and my 8 and 12 year olds wanted their burgers medium. Not medium well or medium rare, just medium. 
They made me sign a release of liability in order to have the burgers cooked that way. Apparently they require it for all kids unless you order medium well or well done. That was a first, a really bizarre first."}
{"text":"from out of town and have heard about this place from friends. We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and there was an hour wait. We could not wait because we had plans. We returned Sunday evening for dinner and got seated right away. 

My table had the stir fried edamame with garlic, chili, and ginger. yummm! We also had a miyagi-san, green and blue burger, and kalbi burger. They were all fabulous! The truffle parkesan fries are addicting!"}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting more than what I got. I ordered the spicy miso burger. Mine really had no seasoning until the last couple bites. And was not spicy whatsoever. The oxtail fries were indeed yummy but everything was quite overpriced to me. Id take one of my own homemade simple burgers over this fancieness anyday."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Bachi Burger on the way to the LV strip. Delicious, creative burgers.  I ordered the spicy miso and the parmesan truffle fries. The fries were honestly some of the best I've ever tasted.   The combination was great,  the food was well prepared and service was friendly. Will definitely go back in the future to try different burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Probably the best burger I've ever had.  I had the black and green and unfortunately I couldn't talk my wife into trying a different burger so we could share...lol.  We also had the oxtail chili cheese fries....Amazing!  The wait was a little long.  Friday lunch.  It was well worth it.  I did finally notice as we were being seated that they had a sign posted stating the other location had more seating and less wait time.  I travel to Vegas a lot for work and fun and will frequent Bachi Burger everytime."}
{"text":"A little over a year ago, I saw signs for Bachi Burger while I was in LV, and  wondered about it. This year I had the opportunity to research on yelp and make plans to go on my most recent trip there last month.

So, having done my research, we aimed for Bachi Burger on our first day in LV. At first when we arrived, we were a little discouraged because there was a group of 6 or so folks that looked like they were waiting in line outside the door. Luckily there was a super nice guy at the front of the line and he suggested I go inside and see how long the wait would be and get on the list. Good thing! The wait for larger groups was long, but they sat my party of 2 immediately. The wait for a table would have been 5 minutes, but we were more than happy to sit at the bar.

Our food choices (shared) were the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Kiki's Burger. I just could not pass up the fries, based on everyone's reviews. Ohhhh, they were really good!! I found them to be more of a \"fork & knife\" kind of fries, rather than finger food, since there's so much going on in there--chili, cheese, fried egg, aioli....All of the flavors went so well together, and yet you could taste the individual components, too. Yummy! The Kiki's burger was also really good. If you're thinking \"mushroom bacon cheeseburger\" ok...but there's so much more! First of all, three different mushrooms (shitake, enoki and eryngyii) make the mushroom flavor profile so much more complex. The cheese (gruyere) was strong enough to keep up with the mushrooms, and the sweet onion marmalade added a counterpoint of sweetness that just well, sang. 

I ordered a house made soda--the cherry yuzu--which was also good. I'm not usually a soda drinker, but I just couldn't pass up the yuzu. It was a little more cherry flavor than yuzu, but that's ok.

Service was very friendly, and yes, like others have said, it was kind of like being at home in Hawaii--so many local-looking faces both working and eating at Bachi Burger. Hm, now could we just convince them to come home and open up a place here?"}
{"text":"worth the try. Nice fusion style burger. I have ordered the Kiki burger and Miyagi. Both, I think, is quite awesome."}
{"text":"We were greeted by the waiter Matt with \"what can I DO TO YOU ladies tonight ? Opps I mean what can I get for you ?\" Wow ! Did this guy really just say this ? Joking or not still very unprofessional. 

Anyway onto the food .. Tried this place once before when it just opened and wasn't impressed .. Thought maybe we just ordered the wrong thing ? So it got some hype with it being on triple D and with the reviews I figured I'd try it again. Still Not impressed .. Oxtail fries nothing special and for $11? so not worth it .. I'd rather go to California hotel and get a big bowl of oxtail soup with rice for $10 ! I'd stand in line too for an hour and give them an extra $5 for tip ! Also got the Ronin burger .. Again it was OK .. For $10 I would rather them give me 3 of the buns only .. That was the only thing that was good tonight .. Also it's a bit pricey total came to $27 for a burger n fries .. i should've went to In-N-Out with the $7 and put $20 on black at southpoint ! Overhyped I think .. Nothing to go out of your way of .. I'd go here only if McDonald's wasn't 24 hours or if fuku Burger ran outta business .. But we all know that's not happening anytime soon"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend, so I had to give it a try. Got the Dogfish Head Burton Baton beer, the Back and Green burger, and the Salt and Pepper fires. Nothing like a day you can have a beer with lunch.
I have to say that this is one of the best burgers that I have ever had. It's really great. 
I have now been to this place about 5 times in the last two weeks."}
{"text":"Another TV trophy burger place!
I ordered the Classic bachi BBQ angus 7.5 oz burger. Tastes like a very refined Teri burger, with good beef. Red onions thinly sliced and crisp lettuce in a brioche bun. Overall a very balanced, hearty burger. 4 stars
Truffle Parmesan fries with a light Parmesan dusting.  Solid but not exceptional. 3.5 stars.

Asian influences in the decoration. Service efficient and polite. 
Capacity at about 80- 100 guests.
Located in the interior of a moderate sized shopping center.  Ample lot parking.
I would come back. I'd like to try the duck in steamed buns!"}
{"text":"I came to Vegas to visit the Grand Canyon, and check out some of their burger joints. Bachi Burger was one of the places on my hit list.

Drum roll please. If finding the best burger is like finding a needle in a hay stack, then Bachi's \"Black and Green\" burger is the needle. In my opinion, this may be the best burger on the planet. Yes, the planet. Why you ask? Let start off with the extraordinary grilling of the wagyu beef, the beef had incredible flavor. The caramelization of the meat was quite unique. Check out the picture. Not your typical burger in any way.

The additional added ingredients like the blue cheese ( who would have thought blue cheese would have worked so well on a burger), roasted garlic, mushrooms, and some great greens. The bun was also a unique part of this burger. Everything worked superbly on this burger. 

If you come to Vegas, and you're into burgers, you need to make going to Bachi a priority. They're located in Henderson, 8 miles outside of Vegas. If you don't have a car, take Uber or Lyft, like I did. 

By the way, using Bachi's burger as a gauge, if you're paying more than $16 for a burger, you're paying too much. I don't care what's on it."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to drive somewhere to eat off of the beaten path when vacationing in Las Vegas because there are so many great places on the strip.  I was brought to Bachi Burger as a place we had to try, and the food did not disappoint.  

My first impression was that of skepticism since it is in a strip mall with not too much else around.  The looks of the place are pretty underwhelming when leaving the glamour and all the lights to the dusty roads of the dessert, but the food was definitely worthy of the visit.  I ordered the Kalbi burger, with no mayo, and fries. The burger had an excellent flavor that was on the sweet side. It actually tasted like what I thought it would judging by the picture and the ingredients.  It definitely satisfied my burger craving.  The fries were regular, but they came with pineapple ketchup.  That also tasted like what I hoped for.  It had a mild pineapple flavor that was not too overpowering.  It was a very tasty meal overall.

I am never too keen on leaving the strip when visiting Las Vegas, but Bachi Burger was worth the drive.  There are a couple of burger places in Vegas that I prefer, but they have unique burgers and ingredients here that make it worth a visit."}
{"text":"So I had such an awesome experience at the Bachi on Sahara that I was SuPer excited there was one closer to the Southwest side.. So we came here as a last supper for my cousin who was leaving Vegas... I really loved Bachi until we went to this location.. No one greeted us we stood there & there was only 2 other tables seated.. Then our server.. Mannn I am all about making sure to tip well for service & we SO didn't get that.. He forgot my daughters drink, an order or fries & he just kept saying ok, yah.. He never really listened to us while he was taking our order.. We are big foodies & was sad & disappointed about the service.. The food was good but not like the awesomely great experience I had the last time...Honestly I love Bachi's food & quality... But the service totally killed it for us :/"}
{"text":"Best Burger place in town.   Ronin and Kylos (sp?) burgers are amazing.  As are the parm truffle fries and sweet potato fries.

The Spicy Miso burger is now no longer available.   Here's to hoping they bring it back..."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had heard nothing but good things about Bachi Burger.... So we finally decided to try it last night ! The food is AWSOME ... The bun is the best I have ever had  ( soft on the outside and is grilled for a nice crunch) ! We had the ox tail fries ..we had the jalapeño taken out but was told they were in the chili. I did not mind the heat  to much, was a nice balance with the sweetness from the chili. I had the boba tea with taro ..YUM! 
The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the mediocre  service and the higher price for the food. 
All in all I would recommend Bachi Burger to anyone who wants some great food with a Asian twist!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Miyagi-San's Burger without bacon and it was very good, I'm surprised for the price, the regular French fries are not included with the burger but it's ok, the size is enough.. everything on the menu looks good but I can't try a lot! So I took also a dessert and it looked good! The team is nice and look cool.. the only reason why I gave only 4 stars is because I don't understand why a burger place sell also Chinese food like ramens, miso soup.. (2 last pages in the menu). But anyway.. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Food tasted great but the service was awful! We ordered the ox tail fries and pork buns for appetizers and 4 burgers. The appetizers came out lightning quick and we ate them up as we were super hungry.

As for the burgers.... they were no where to be seen. We waited and ordered drinks to pass some time and the waitress assured us our order was next. But as orders came flying out the kitchen, none of them was ours. We saw people who came after us getting their burgers and new sets of customers who were barely there for 15 mins to get their food. Our order should have been priority but they decided to put our order behind the orders of newer customers. Our waitress began to ignore us knowingly they jacked up order.

It took us well over an hour for us to finally get our food and when we finally got our food the waitress basically threw the burgers at us and tried to avoid eye contact with us. They ended up comping us a round of drinks but that doesn't make up for the time lost and the poor service."}
{"text":"Not the best of burger places. No pickles no regular ketchup and kind of pricey.  Taste like any old burger. Also the service was very slow"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We had the Bánh Mi burger and the Spicy Miso Burger along with some garlic fries and shishito peppers. Everything was well executed and absolutely delicious. Oh yeah, Thai iced tea was great too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This Bachi location is serving breakfast now.  My gf and I are fans of the burgers so we thought we would give their AM eats a try.  We each ordered a unique twist on Loco Moco, hers with pork belly & risotto and mine with braised short rib & fried rice.  Both were delicious, unique  creations based upon the Hawaiian classic and I would highly recommend either.  We also ordered Banana Blueberry pancakes which LOOKED amazing, but were sadly dry, flavorless and the one on the bottom of the stack was severely burnt.  We waited quite a while (20-30 minutes) for our food to arrive as well, even though there was only one other table in the restaurant the whole time we were there.  We are in the restaurant biz so we were probably much more forgiving than folks who cannot relate.  We will be back and I would definitely tell all my friends to try their twist on Loco Moco.  Good job Bachi!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Def worth the drive off the strip for a tourist like myself. The oxtail chili cheese fries outshines the burgers for me so that's the reason for the 4 stars. Don't get me wrong everything was good and to be fair I ate at 11am on a Tuesday so maybe it wasn't the A crowd in the kitchen. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Bachi Burger was because it was on the Travel Channel / Food Network and since i am a burger lover i thought I give this place a shot. When i went i really wasnt too thrilled about it. It was whatevers to me. I decided to give it a second try since my friend says its good and was surprised i didnt like it. This time it was what i expected! It was really good. That juicy, tender moist Asian flavored burger was bomb... It was called Spicy Miyo .. For apps we had the fried calamari with a side of their flavored sauces and jalapeno on it. Yumm!! For desert i had the Portuguese donuts .. Which was ok!the side of the coffee gelato was good. Deff will come back next time i crave something exotic."}
{"text":"Saturday night in Vegas - Woohoo!!!  Post workout grub, errand and Zzzzzzzzz...

Monkey do:

SHOGUN BURGER- wagyu beef & grilled unagi w/pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, yamamomo peach

Organic Sumatra COFFEE- black

Clean neighborhood joint with adjoining Ramen restaurant next door. Your less avid fans of specialty food can wait for you around the corner at standard sub sandwich place. Make time to come sit, savor and indulge. Take a load off and enjoy beer, wine or even adult milkshakes.

This Monkey's favorite burger in Vegas.  Will return often."}
{"text":"Another rare occasion for big breakfast in Vegas during daylight, Monkey go Bachi!

This the only Bachi location serving breakfast, from 9am to 12 noon. Bachi Burgers are insanely delicious, so Monkey eager to try this again, even though menu has been significantly reduced. No more Taro Pancakes- Boo!!!

Monkey do:

Organic Sumatra Coffee
SHORT RIB LOCO MOCO over risotto(instead of kimchi fried rice), grilled onions, gravy aside
BRIOCHE FRENCH TOAST- dipped in coconut almond custard, mixed berry compote, maple & coconut syrup

Awesome SRLM to hold Monkey for a long day. Gravy too salty for Monkey taste, but I know some like it like that. French toast is toasty, dry bread with jam. Menu say banana, but I don't see?  It's okay.  Ate it the next day. Grub!

Clean restaurant with several booths and tables for larger parties. Parking lot is shared, free and dirty. Service is friendly, smiley and helpful when you just can't decide. Slightly pricey, but plates are shareable. Monkey will definitely return for that short rib and try pancakes!"}
{"text":"Sometimes fusion flavors don't work on everyone's palate as was our case with the sweet potato fries and yuzu aoli. They accommodated us by switching it out for the pineapple ketchup. Split the mushroom burger which was mushroomy and tasty. It was a-ok. The most notable part of our visit was the green salt in the salt shaker which we were told was bamboo salt. Neat!"}
{"text":"The oxtail french fries was amazing!  Go get it!  I might as well make some fries and put an egg on top because I suddenly have a crazing.  The burgers were excellent too.  It's a great way to start Vegas or end Vegas!  Go go go!"}
{"text":"My first time here recommended by a friend and loved it, a little something outside the box if you like asian fusion burgers, i got the bahn mi burger tasted what it sounded like, and the oxtail chili fries was really good. I'd definitely come back for a 2nd round, the poke wasn't too bad, portion was a little small for me, but the sauce they used was delicious. And the service was great as well and food was served promptly."}
{"text":"Sooo good!! I get the veggie burger or the fish sandwich. Both are so delicious. Also try to fries with the sun dried tomato dip--so yummy!"}
{"text":"We generally enjoy Bachi because it allows the family to have a variety of options if we're all hungry for something different. Unfortunately, when we visited today they weren't serving ramen, which is what my wife was hungry for. As we further explored the menu and started thinking of other things to order we learned that they were also out of chicken wings, duck steamed buns, the chefs special burger and other items. We ended up not ordering off the limited menu and chose another restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"I actually frequent this place and have always had mixed feelings about what review to give. The food has been pretty consistently good 90% of the time.  

However, IMO - the worst idea ever was to merge Shoku and Bachi together. For those that just want a bowl of noodles (which is pretty good) you are thrown in the same dining area as the Bachi customers. Imagine merging two restaurants together but only having half the wait staff. Maybe you're trying to save money, I don't know. But please understand that you don't have enough wait staff. Your tables are only 50-60% filled, yet you have 5+ parties waiting to be seated during peak times for more than 30+ min. This has happened on my last 3 recent visits. Don't you realize you're only hurting your own profits?

You may also want to train your kitchen staff that when people at the table order noodles with takoyaki and a kakuni bowl that you should probably bring those appetizers out \"before\" the noodles and not after.

I love the food, but I don't like how unorganized it is. Get your hard working servers some extra help!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop for something to eat after a 4 hour drive from OC. We were STARVING! 

It is really hard deciding which burger to get because they all sound so good. I was torn between Mr Miyagi and the Ronin. I followed the waitresses suggestion and ordered the Ronin. When it arrived, I was missing the \"wow\" factor of the other burgers I saw on other reviews. It was also cooked well done instead of medium like I ordered. It was tasty but not something I would crave next time.

The truffle fries were good.

If I come back, I would try a different burger."}
{"text":"After eating at The Noodle Man, I decided my tastebuds weren't fulfilled in culinary delight, with that being said we decided to go to Bachi Burger down the street since this new location just recently opened up (I've been to the Henderson location and Summerlin).

The restaurant is hard to miss if you aren't looking hard for it while driving on Russell. When we walked in there was no one there and we were sat immediately and given menus. The menu is not any different from the other locations except I found something new- \"Happy Hour\"! Great, we were just in time for this treat. $6 appetizers and 50% off appetizers that were under $6, $6 speciality drinks and $5 draft beers. So we ordered:

Bachi Pickles- My friend ordered this and loved it. I do not really like pickled dishes although it was an assortment of colorful veggies that were just... pickled. 

Fried Chili Chicken Wings- Okay so since I have been to all of the locations in Las Vegas (there are newly opened restaurants in LA now; they've gone corporate), the overall food flavoring is very SWEET, this includes the chicken wings, the wings were fried very well but the taste was a sweet flavoring, close to the liking of.. think orange chicken from panda express. It was good if you like the taste of sweetness. The plating was great with scallions and sesame seeds. 

Oxtail Cheese Fries- Again, the sweetness! I would have loved this dish if it tasted more like pho broth and oxtail pho sauce than a sweet BBQ taste. Overall I liked this dish because... well who doesn't like chill cheese fries.

 Ahi Poke- Even though this was in the appetizer list it unfortunately did not get any of the happy hour discounts. Great pieces of sashimi grade tuna but was decent with flavoring, I would try Hawaiian Style Poke restaurant if you have a hankering for poke instead. 

We decided on seasonal strawberry/mango sangrias and the Japanese cucumber/ginger mojito, both were very delicious but a little watered down and couldn't taste the flavor of some of the key ingredients listed in the drink.

Overall, it is just like the other locations. Service was prompt and inviting would go back only because the service was beyond par and happy hour isn't too shabby either! :)"}
{"text":"Always great burgers and good selection of craft beers. Great service as well. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoy Bachi Burger every time. The calamari is very light and the chicken wings are so delicious and juicy."}
{"text":"So, we came here for a late lunch at 4pm with a group total of 9. 8 total people eating and one baby. The hostess decided to give us crap because we told her 8 instead of 9. Then proceeded to give us an attitude about how many kids were in our group. What does it matter? Is there a kids menu at Bachi Burger? Not that I know of... Anyway, we left after sitting there from 3:45 to 4:20 without getting seated and went to the Bachi Burger in Summerlin. Really disappointed. 2 stars because I know the food is great. -3 for horrible service.

BTW the service at Bachi Burger in Summerlin was excellent. I'll write another separate review for that establishment."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Started with the fries, salty, oxtail and truffle variety. All good! Drinks, Thai Iced Tea, pineapple wild berry, apple lychee, all good! Had to have the Apple Lychee Iced Tea made, again, no problem! Burgers, Miyagi-san, Spicy Miso, Lonely Bird all good! A little bit of a wait, but worth it! Too  full to talk, going into food coma........"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has by far been one of the most tasty burgers I've ever had. It's an asian fusion!  Very interesting and well played, I'll have to say it's the best burger joint in Vegas, but also an expensive one.  The first burger I had wasn't that great, it had a gingery taste to it I think it was called the Ronin Burger.  But I gave it another chance and boy, it was amazing.  The Kalbi burger and The Kiki Burger are my favorites.  It's like an explosion of flavor in your mouth! The meat is cooked to my liking, never too well done.  If you do decide to get the Kalbi Burger, order an egg to it.  Trust me, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.

Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q 

Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese \"ban-mi\" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.  

We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:

- Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g 
 
- Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g 

- Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w 

The restaurant's name, \"Bachi,\" takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word \"hibachi\" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)

Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the décor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ
 
Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.

I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't hard to get a table.  I used to love their Kiki burger and onion rings but this visit was disappointing.  The onion rings are no longer on the menu but you can still order them.  I was disappointed that after I ate one, my fingers were dropping with grease :(

The burger was ok.  My friend ordered ramen, French fries and strawberry lemonade ($4.50).  He said the ramen was ok, but the French fries were undercooked and wilted.  The biggest problem was the drink - the non-refillable lemonade was just a glass of ice with just a little bit of juice!!  I will attach a photo that shows how much ice was left after he drank the juice!  Unbelievable... and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I came here.We just walked in and have seats right away. Great services. Friendly staffs. Food is good. I don't really like the matcha green tea here."}
{"text":"Lack of vegetarian options. But they made a Burger with a fried egg spinach and caramelized mushrooms and onions. Very unique aiolis with an Asian flavor influence. What really saved them were their fries. I really enjoyed the truffle Parmesan and the sweet potato fries. 
The service was slightly slow for our group of eight."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have eaten at in Las Vegas. Excellent Asian fusion burgers, that scared me at first til i got their and saw the attention to detail that they use when preparing the food. The shakes are great and the ability to commingle Asian flavors with great burgers blew me away. Well worth the money and time! Can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can have more"}
{"text":"The oxtail chili fries tasted like Nalleys canned chili. There was shredded oxtail in there, but the chili seasoning flavor just overpowered the goodness of the oxtail so you couldn't get any flavor from it.

I was with a group so I got to try a few different burgers. The Black & green burger was alright but just tasted like any Blue cheese burger. The Kiki's burger just tasted like a grilled onion and mushroom burger and the Miyagi burger just tasted like a caramelized onion burger. The burgers were no stand outs to any other burgers. Yes the burger patties were juicy and tender, but lacked flavor. Did not taste like they seasoned it with any salt or seasoning. Red Robin's burgers taste better in my opinion. I guess I should of put some salt on it myself but I wanted to eat it as it was supposed to be. I also think that the patties had too much of a char on them. The bun though was light fluffy and a little sweet which was really good. It is the bun used to make Chinese baked BBQ pork buns."}
{"text":"Was craving a burger and decided to try this place after a long drive. 

After reading the reviews my friends and I decided to start with the overrated oxtail chili cheese fries. For the first couple of bites it was pretty good but after that it became overwhelming. The chili began to taste a lot like bbq sauce. It was REALLY SWEET but also salty at the same time. The oxtail meat was also dry. 

The burgers tho... The medium rare is more on the rare side but I'm not complaining. I got the KiKi's Burger and it was delicious. Although it wasn't waygu (whatever), the meat was really juicy and tasty but also very oily. 

I also tried my friend's Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and damn you can really taste the difference in the beef! I recommend you try the wagyu beef if you haven't. This burger was also oily and definitely on the messier side."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers.  The sauces for the sweet potato fries and parmesan truffle fries are the most original sauces I've had.  No boring ketchup here.  We sat at the bar area cause we did not have time to wait for a table.  The bartender/waiter was very polite and professional.  He did a great job taking care of us while being busy with constant drink orders from other waitresses."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the windmill location so we figure we would give this one a shot since it's closer to home.  Walked in and was not greeted very politely by the host.  Almost as if we were a nuisance.  So we left.  I guess my money isn't good at this location.  Oh well, enjoyed Archies thai food better anyway."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome burger selections I had the miyagi sans burger which was pretty phenomenal. The duck bun was not as good as I thought it would be but still very good. The only downside of this place is that it's pretty expensive for what you get but if you're ready to splurge on some dank Asian fusion burgers this is the place!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with Bachi Burger.  For a fancy burger place, I expected more out of the meat.  I got the black and green burger.  I love blue cheese and mushrooms.  But, something about this burger did not blow me away.  It was good, but I was not left with the desire to return to Bachi Burger for more.  I much prefer Umami."}
{"text":"HOW LONG I WAITED-- Friends' food came out at sporadic times. The ramen I ordered came out 15 minutes after the first entree was on the table. We game with a group of 11, but timing is very important when it comes to group eating. 

WHAT I ATE-- Pork belly bao's were great. Spicy miso ramen was great once it came out. 

WHY I CAME-- We phoned in earlier to ask if they would be able to accommodate a group of 11. The hostess was very gracious on the phone and in person."}
{"text":"Order the pork buns and the oxtail chili cheese fries because they're amazing. The pork belly buns have thick cuts of pork and egg and the oxtail chili cheese fries are piled high topped with a sweet and savory oxtail chili cheese topping and jalapenos. The burgers are decent but these two items on the menu always get me and I end up not ordering anything else. For hamburgers, I prefer Umami Burger, but their beef is high quality from the burgers I've tried. It's just that no hamburger particularly stands out enough for me to recommend."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is amaze-balls!  Honestly you can't go wrong with any burger.  Everything is pretty yummy!  But if I must, let me give you a few suggestions...Kiki burger-Bomb!  Miyagi-San Burger is bomb AF.  Kalbi burger-really do I need to go on....but for real tho...BOMB.com.

Don't forget to order some oxtail fries!  Another winner!  I've also had their garlic shrimp special...this is as close as you can get to Giovanni's shrimp truck on the north shore of Oahu.  Yes I'm from Hawaii, I know what I'm talking about.  

Overall, great place to get your burger fix.  Next time I need to try their shakes, heard those were delicious."}
{"text":"Asian flavors, asian-inspiration, and gourmet cooking infused into the All-American classic - we are Bachi Burger!
This is their tag line for this wonderfully delicious restaurant located about seven minutes or so from the strip.

Minh found this place while looking through Yelp one day and bookmarked it for us to try while we were in town!

Armed and hungry we invited our friends to join in on our adventure one sunny afternoon. Bachi Burger is the new kid in town located in a new strip mall, they have plenty of parking, but I could see it being a problem if it was the lunch or dinner rush hour.

As the four of us entered we were greeted and promptly seated at a nearby table. Our server gave us our menus and took our drink orders.

Minh and I ordered green ice tea, while we were waiting for our drinks to be delivered we all looked over their amazing menu and their selection made it hard to choose just one thing.

We decided to share among the four of us:

-Pork Belly Steamed Buns-Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Callions, Radish, Boiled
Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, Hoisin BBQ Sauce.

What can I say about a fluffy soft steamed bun overflowing with pork belly except for yum yum in my tum tum!! The pork belly was tender with just a slight bit of fat still attached the bbq sauce and vinaigrette mixed well together. But beware this bun can be a tad messy as juices were dripping down my hand and onto the plate.


I ordered:

Kiki's Burger-Angus Beef .Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngi Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli.

Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries-Maui Onion Sea Salt, Garlic Chili Aioli. 

The Kiki burger is more of a sweet tasting burger. Which I was not expecting, but was happy with my decision and ended up eating the whole burger. The buns were not overly bready more on the thinner side. The angus beef was tender along and the toppings meshed well together. The only thing I could not locate was the bacon! Where was it, I could taste it but not see it at all! 

The fries were more than enough for two people to share, which I did with my handsome boyfriend! The chili aioli was okay but to me it did not really go with the fries. I am more of a ranch or ketchup kind of gal when it comes to my fries! Fries were crispy and not overly done.

Our server kept checking on us often making sure we were happy with what we ordered. 

I think Bachi Burger needs to come out to So. Cali this would be one place I could never get sick of!"}
{"text":"Bachi is always a hit! Love their oxtail fries and burgers. Can't really go wrong with any choice!"}
{"text":"Went for first time today. Burgers are very good, but...between 2 burgers, 2 ice teas and one side of fries. $40. The staff was friendly too. But when you're on a budget $40 is a bit steep. Those of you who have unlimited funds, go!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm!!!!   Had the Bison Burger, husband had the Miagisan (sp?) burger and we shared the Oxtail fries. Everything was super yummy!!! And now after this weekend's feasting... I need to go on a months fast.  I'm about to POP!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, pretentious, arrogant yet clearly inexperienced service. I woulda gave 1 star but I didn't die. No wonder the place was empty. Run!!"}
{"text":"I came in, party of 3, on a Sunday and we were seated right away. The server took our drink orders first and came back promptly to take the rest of our order. We got the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was delicious, just the perfect amount of chili and spice. I didn't eat the jalapenos in it because it would have been too spicy, but even without the jalapenos, the fries still had a kick of spice. We also got an order of pork belly buns, but we didn't like it. It was way too thick and fatty. We may have been better off with the peking duck buns. My friend had the Bachi burger and he really enjoyed it. He said it is flavorful and filling. I recommend the oxtail fries, so I would definitely come back for that."}
{"text":"I love this place! Normally I am not someone who really likes burgers or fries very much, but here I cannot get enough of them.  There garlic pepper fries have garlic sliced peppers and ginger, and a nice dipping sauce that has some kick.  There truffle parmesean fries are also amazing! What is nice is they aren't soggy or to thick.  My favorite burger is the kiki burger, but I have never had a burger I did not like there.  I will say the shogun burger, while being tasty, was not mind blowing enough for me to want to buy a 25 dollar burger again.  One thing to keep in mind is the burgers always have a sweet element to them, which I like, but my friend told me that even her burger with the blue cheese and garlic and such had this component to it.  She still really enjoyed it, but it could be that this component of their flavor profile is a bit redudant and overused in their burger dishes.  I greatly enjoy their boba milk teas, although way overpriced compared to other places.  I always get the jasmine. Their burger meat is grinded in house which add to the freshness, and allows them not have to cook it into submission, and their buns are super fresh too.  I will recommened that if you get a burger to not get it as a pick up, they are packed with saucy goodness and super juicy, which basically means on your ride home they will getting your bun super soggy."}
{"text":"I cannot wait for Bachi Burger to open its doors in southern California!

The burgers are delicious and the oxtail chilli fries hit the spot.  Surprisingly, my favorite was their bloody mary.  So much flavor and the perfect way to end a Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Sort of a long wait but worth it. The foods great and the ambience is great too. We had a wonderful server who checked on us at the right times. I tried the miyagi San and it was the bomb I usually just get the Kiki but the Miyagi San was really good along with the Parmesan truffle fries and red velvet shake. Mhmmm"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on service. 

I wish I could review the food but we never got to try it. We walked in and were immediately seated. While waiting to have our drink order taken I mentioned to the party next to us that their chili fries looked good but they complained their order was wrong. The waitress came over and spoke with them and went to correct the mistake, however, she never greeted us. She then came out and checked on another table and went back to the kitchen where her and 3 other members of the staff were talking. After 10 minutes of sitting there without anyone coming to our table we left.    Apparently their business is so good they don't need new customers."}
{"text":"This is one of the things I look forward to when in Vegas. This time was no different. I craved for the burgers and oxtail fries only to be disappointed when I finally had my taste! 

Our party of 10 arrived around 11:45am. While the restaurant had a few diners already, we were told by the very rude guy up front that it would take 15-20 minutes so the staff can get caught up with orders. Totally fine except he was extremely rude about it. When we were finally seated our server was great. She took our orders and was pretty efficient. 

Our food arrived and we immediately noticed that it didn't look the way it did before. Nor was the flavors the same. My beloved favorite Bachi Burger was no longer the way it was before. I was extremely disappointed. 

Not only the food was a total disappointment but the whole place seemed to have been trashed! With only one restroom available, the womens, it was gross and very dirty. The owners need to invest in this place in order for this to survive long term. It is no longer the same Bachi Burger I waited hours for. It's now a place I will definitely avoid!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic. It's so fantastic that by the time I leave the restaurant after giving this place yet another chance, I think that maybe it's worth all of the issues. But.. after multiple visits over the past three years. It's just not worth it.

The fact is that this is the worst managed restaurant on the planet, and the food is just so outstandingly good that it somehow scrapes by.

Come into this place and be prepared to wait. There's always a waiting list. However, it's artificial. Look past the list and you'll see a restaurant with multiple empty tables and a complete bar counter that isn't sat. Management refuses to properly staff the restaurant.

Every now and then, you'll finally be sat at one of the multitude of empty tables. Don't get your hopes up because management hasn't staffed the kitchen either. Be prepared to wait for a very long time. 

It's okay though. Look at the menu. This place has a decent selection of draft beers and an impressive list of bottled beers. The long wait won't seem so long as you partake of some drinks. Hell, the restaurant and the wait staff wins cause it's free up selling. Except, management won't stock the bar. The list of 5 draft beers? They only actually have one of those. They're out of the rest. This place is literally throwing away free money. 

These are not one time experiences. I searched through my credit card history, and I've spent over $1500 here in 2016. I'm scared to look at the other years. I've been here multiple times and two things are consistent: the food is outstanding and this is the most mismanaged mess of a restaurant on the planet. And it has been that way for years. Just imagine how shitty this place has been managed that the amazing food just can't save it anymore. 

Ha, there was this one time where I ordered Ramen, and this place ran out of chopsticks. Chopsticks. I can't wrap my head around how that is even possible. How do you run out of an eating utensil? It's the most absurd thing ever."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger, thanks for being vegetarian friendly! I really enjoyed my meal here last night with friends. They had two menus available for us to chose from: Bachi Burger and Shoku Ramen. I'm assuming that the Shoku Ramen place (next door) shared the same owners as Bachi Burger, which is why they had two different menus. 

ATMOSPHERE
Darkened lighting created an intimate atmosphere for friends and couples. Wood paneled walls and skylights made the space feel laid-back and upscale. I was definitely comfortable! It was busy and the tables are spaced far apart from each other so that you have lots of space to have private conversations and can talk loudly without bothering others.

FOOD
Alcohol, Japanese appetizers & Ramen offered from next door's kitchen, and Asian-fusion fries and burgers were on the menu. They have a great selection and there are many choices of burgers for all types of appetites. Because I am a vegetarian who eats seafood, there were options from both menus for me! I also liked that they have the option of add-ins and an ample selection of sauces to accompany the yummy fries. Now onto mine and my boyfriend's selections:

1. TAKOYAKI (FRIED OCTOPUS BALLS) $8.00
Delicious! I love that their takoyaki had 6 bites containing lots of flavor, and generous toppings (bonito flakes, ginger, mayo, takoyaki sauce, etc). Could have been crispier on the outside, but the inside was cooked and had a good bite-sized amount of octopus (tako).

2. NO MEAT HERE BURGER (WITH ADDED SWISS CHEESE) $11.50
Had fried eggplant, shiitake mushroom patty, tomatoes, onions, a perfect soft bun and mixed greens. I think it had some sauce in there as well, and combined with the swiss cheese... You think being vegetarian is a curse? No. This burger is a blessing. If I wasn't vegetarian, I would've have tried it. So THANKS BACHI FOR MAKING ME NOT REGRET MY DECISIONS! Arigato gozaimasu!

3. VEGETARIAN MISO RAMEN (WITH ADDED BOK CHOY) $11.50
Good ramen, good (on the sweet-side) miso flavor. I don't know what their regular ramen broth tastes like, but I'm sure it's equally as good. It is missing a bit of a wow-factor though. But points for having vegetarian choices.

SERVICE
Very understanding and patient server. My friend is one of those people that asks you lots of questions and takes awhile to order. Our guy server (with curly hair I think?) was patient, and explained everything perfectly. He even brought us our somewhat difficult water order, as we all wanted it \"hot\", \"iced' and \"room temperature\". I know, the customers we all dislike. But hey, we were accommodated with a smile, so brownie points for putting up with us! Also, more tip for you, sir!

Overall, good night. A little pricey for burgers, but they are well executed and delicious so no complaints here. Will be back"}
{"text":"The last time we came here the burger was too over done but the flavor was good and we thought worth returning to. But, the service sucks   Last time and this time."}
{"text":"OMG! That was the most amazing burger. I would totally suggest coming here over and over trying something new. I was shock with the amazing flavor profile.

I would suggest the owners to update their website and facebook. They state they have 3 sites. Upon visiting the Russell Road, I learned that they were closed. However, the West Sahara and East Windmill one are still in operation.

Suggest trying: Truffle Parmesan Fries, Black & Green Burger, and Momotaro White Peach & Strawberry."}
{"text":"Black and green burger. Blue cheese with greens, mushrooms and bacon. One of the better burgers I have ever had!!!

A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"We were visiting from NY.  It was so delicious we came back before we returned home.  We loved the Ronin burger, the Banh Mi burger, the Miyagi San burger.  My favorite was the Kiki burger.     Sweet potato fries were yummy!     Plantation sweet tea was unique and super refreshing.  Must order the Lava cake.  So warm and scrumptious."}
{"text":"First off, Taylor, our waiter was very kind and accommodating. The food was very savory, full of flavor and absolutely delicious. The food took a while to come (almost an hour). We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, tantanmen ramen, spicy miso ramen and spicy miso burger. There was a mix up in the ramen orders and the waitresses that brought them out were very rude about it. I'm all about service and I was pretty shocked to get an attitude from them, especially when the mistake was on their end. No apology or anything. The food was so delicious though that we just brushed it off. You must order the chili cheese fries. It was sweet and savory. I wish there was more oxtail on it though. I had the spicy miso ramen. The broth was very rich and flavorful. It can get quite pricey with the add ons. It comes with chasu pork. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I had my fair share of ramen around Orange County and their pork beats them all. The noodles were cooked to perfection. It had the right amount of chewiness. Overall the food was great. I would definitely come back the next time I am in town but I hope for better service."}
{"text":"This was a great burger hang out joint!  The beer selection was awesome and the fries were amazing. The burgers that we tried were super yummy!  Great prices and Melissa was adorable and efficient!"}
{"text":"\"What's furikake?\" asked one of our table-mates. \"Some lettuce thing\", our server so eloquently replied. Yeahhh noooo. From that point on, I knew I wouldn't particularly like it..

But the burger proved me wrong. I don't remember what it was called, but it was the pork and beef one, with the taro bun. The bun didn't have much taro flavor, but was a gorgeous color. The seasoning and sauce on the burger were sweet but not overly so. With the pork in the patty, I think it went well together.

FYI furikake is a type of seasoning, usually a mix of seaweed, sesame seeds, dried and ground fish/veggies that you put on rice."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, but bland and overpriced. We had Kiki burger and bhan mi burger with plain fries. Burgers were too sweet, but otherwise bland. Gimmick burgers similar to Red Robbin, but not as good. For a plain, but really good burger I recommend Springs Cafe or Applebee's (I know it's a chain, but actually really good). Fries were pretty good, but not worth $3.50. Total bill over $30. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Came back with some family members.  This enabled us to see a lot of the menu.  We started off with the Edamame and pickles.  Good flavor with the pickles.  We had the Ronin, Blue and Green, and Bachi burgers.  We also had the steamed bun with short rib.  The short was a bit dry and chewy.  The burgers were very good.  Needed a bit more salt.  They probably make them low salt and allow the diner to add some of the sea salt they have at the table.  The Green and Blue had just the right amount of blue cheese.  Not overpowering.  The parm fries and s&p fries were crispy and are served with a nice dipping sauce.  Overall a good experience and well worth the price.  Even though there were some flaws, the price of admission is well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best gourmet burger joint I've had yet! Love their food and their late night hours! I especially enjoy the unique ingredients thrown together with the most delicious beef cooked perfectly to my liking. I've had several burgers from the menu as well as all the fries. I can honestly say nothing has disappointed. The keke is my absolute fave and I can't decide which of the fries are my favorite. The staff is always friendly and the price isn't bad for the quality of the food. If you enjoy excellent burgers with unique twists on ingredients, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Get your sh*t together, Bachi Burger. It seems like every time I dine here there is some policy that has changed. 

One day you could get onion rings as a side, the next it's a hard no even though they still make them to put on the burgers. Today, the yuzu citrus aioli that has always been served with the Ronin Burger has to be requested and is a $0.50 charge even though the menu still indicates that the burger is served with it. 

The burgers are still delicious (thankfully), but if you don't ask for your fries crispy they will show up soggy and damn near raw. 

It's so disappointing that a restaurant that serves a consistently good burger cannot be as consistent with their service. The lack of service and consistency in menu policies really drives my business away and I find it difficult to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Excellent service, had waygu beef cheeseburger, the best seasoned, most flavorful burger I have ever eaten in my life. Also had the ramen noodles, just because, they were equally delicious. Wide variety of menu items, definitely will go back to try different things, whenever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"AHH....MAZING!!! I loved this place. The waiter, Luis, was friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered a Spicy Miso Burger at the waiter's recommendation. Oh, my. . .  it was delicious. With all the flavor of a Korean Bibim Pap dish, wrapped into a burger. It was too big to pick up, so I used my fork and knife and I have to say it was perfection.  What a perfect place to enjoy a dinner with friends!  Thank you, Bachi Burger.  I intend to return the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I didn't have to wait for a table for two for 15 minutes this place would have got a 5 star review, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I came with one friend and waited 10-15 minutes for a table in a somewhat empty restaurant all because they were understaffed. Luckily the burger surpassed my expectations and that one star will be docked until the next time. 

I ordered the salt and pepper fries, the spicy miso burger, and I tried a bit of my friends' Kiki's burger. It was hard settling on a burger choice because every combo looked so damn interesting. After reading Yelp recommendations for the spicy miso burger I finally decided on it and boy was that a GREAT choice. 

First bite in and I tasted a crunch and then a parade of asian flavors dancing around in my mouth. From the potent ginger and soy sauce aroma in the restaurant I assumed that the burger would have the same pungent asian flavors. I asked for my burger to be medium well and it came out perfectly cooked, same with my friends' burger (which rarely ever happens, pun intended). I wish there was a way to explain how great the flavor pairings were but it is something you need to experience first hand. 

The size of the burger was perfect, not too filling and worth all 10 of my money. I love having some type of carby side dish and even though oxtail fries were a highly recommended menu item I sprung for the salt and pepper fries. You would assume from the title that they would be just that, but their was a kick of jalapeno, some cilantro, garlic, but the true taste changer was the maui onion sea salt, it was perfect with the aioli served with the fries. 

I am definitely going to come back on my next Vegas trip, even though it is a far ways away from the strip (I don't mind traveling for food though)."}
{"text":"First time to this location...tucked away in a plaza on Russell...hoping this will be just as yummies as the Village Square one!  
Food review to come..."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this burger joint after watching Triple D on tv. I came here straight from the airport and ordered the Shogun Burger and Oxtail Chili Fries. The oxtail chili fries was so so, wasn't too impressed with it, but the Shogun Burger was to die for. One of the best burger in Vegas, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Service sucked, the food was ok. I won't be back, there are many more places just like this that have better service. Slow to greet, messed up bills, took forever to get food and overcharged my credit card."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Sad to say. They left me waiting 15 minutes to take a drink order all while helping the table ne,let to me that was seated after me.

HORRIBLE SERVICE RUINED THE WHOLE NIGHT!!!!"}
{"text":"Asian style burgers? It was good, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Reminds me of Umami Burger here in SF, but bigger and better. 

Their burgers use the same type of buns for barbecue pork buns! One unique thing I noticed. And their meat patties are marinated in some type of a sweet sauce. The burgers looks and tastes extra juicy! 

They also have Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. The fries were super addicting. It had a sort of a spice to it that made it so sweet yet savory at the same time. I honestly thought the idea of Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries could have been executed better. Hmmn...maybe like more sweetness to the ox tail? Ox tail reminds me of braised beef, so if that slow cooked turned sweet tasting taste was drenched all over fries... I think I would have liked it much better. The chili all over the fries was okay. I sort of avoided eating it... weird I know since it defeats the purpose of having chili on this dish. 

I decided to get the Pork Belly buns. Sort of pricy, but pork belly tends to be expensive. Ever since my trip to NYC I have been craving this! It is hard to find a place serving even DECENT pork belly buns. This place was decent. It was dinky but I really liked it! This dish half-filled my satisfaction. 

Their boba is fresh too! A bit of an increase in price for your average boba, but they serve it in a nice glass cup! 

Friendly workers here! Nice modern Asian fusion burger joint."}
{"text":"After a long week of studying and being tortured with exams, I was really looking forward to my birthday dinner with some friends. I had been here before and had a great time, but sadly the second time around wasn't up to par. 

Pretty much everything is cooked in peanut oil. So if you have any type of nut allergy, you're out of luck. You would think that an establishment like this would offer some type of substitution, or have a disclaimer on the menu, but apparently not the case. We have a friend who has a peanut allergy, so she ordered one of the steamed bun dishes, because she was told this dish did not contain peanut oil. After eating this dish, she did not feel well. Thankfully nothing bad happened to her. It may have missed it, but I don't recall seeing anyone offer an apology or anything along those lines. However, most of us with the exception of 1 or 2 people did not feel well after eating dinner here, so I'm not sure what was going on. 

Probably won't go back after this episode."}
{"text":"Best burger in Las Vegas??? Getting there, if only the meat gets better. A burger should be juicy and hot. It should taste meaty, manly almost. Bachi has all the right ingredients for a fantastic burger joint. Great decor. Perfect bread. Exotics like Foe Gras. Right size burgers. Fries cooked and seasoned to perfection. I just wish the meat is better. I mean, Wagyu patties should taste significantly better than regular ground patties. But it doesn't, it's indiscernible because their side ingredients are cooked so well. 

My advice (I'm not a professional chef by any means) they need to:
1. Add more fat to the meat
2. Do not over cook or squeeze the juices out
3. Don't let it rest for too long and cool down. 

My final advice and too late, is if you have a liquor license, why not make a cool bar to hang out at? So much potential to be amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been to bachi burger many many times, and I have never been disappointed.  For all of you complainers about the wait, the food is worth it.  I will admit, sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I have never had a bad experience food wise at bachi,

I have had the ronin burger, the kiki burger, the kalbi burger, the duck steamed buns, and the oooohhhhh sooooo goooooooooood ox tail soup (special biatch!), and all have been sublime.  On top of that, the fries (sweet potato or Parmesan or sea salt & garlic) are amazing.

Bachi is one of those places where you NEED to take a cab off of the strip and enjoy the food.  Better yet, rent a car and explore the amazing offerings off of the strip, which would include bachi burger and nielsens!"}
{"text":"Came tonight for a late lunch/early dinner around 4:00. We were seated right away and our server was attentive.

Boyfriend ordered the $12 calamari appetizer which was all fresh and tossed in red peppers, mint and tomatoes. You get the rings and full tentacles. Served with a side of green oil which we couldn't figure out the taste. He loved it but me I cant stand seafood lol so of course when I took a bite to try I was sick the rest of my meal.

Everything is served a la carte so we ordered Parmesan truffle fries for $4.
Boyfriend ordered the Mr. Miyagi burger cooked medium. Presentation was cool but the amount of onion rings was a bit much. He really enjoyed it otherwise.

Honestly wasn't that impressed with my own burger. I ordered the Standard Bachi burger this only comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and a subtle BBQ drenched meat patty. All other toppings including cheese are an additional $1.50 each. I added cheddar cheese and applewood smoked bacon. Bacon portion was a little chinsy 1.5 pieces, really?? Why not give the full 2 pieces? Ok so I ordered medium well and it was pink/almost red all the way through. I didn't want to send it back but it definitely was not what I like. The sauce that covers the patty was such a subtle taste but was pretty good. 

The buns are amazing, some sort of Asian sweet roll that is baked daily and delivered fresh daily. 

Really wasn't happy with the soda choices, first off Pepsi eew. But to make things worse they only have Pepsi, diet Pepsi, Sierra mist and root beer. 

Total bill came to about $50 and we just weren't that satisfied for the price. Cool concept and I'm sure we will be back because the variety of items they offer. Definitely want to try the pork belly sliders !"}
{"text":"It was alright but expensive (maybe??) . We tried the Ronin and the Shogun one. For me theRonin tasted better. Service was kind slow even the place was not busy and we had to wait 30m."}
{"text":"Love their fries, burgers and sodas. Looooove the chili cheese fries made with oxtail meat. Looooove bachi fish sandwich - it's to die for!!!! The sauce is Soooooo good with the sweet bread. Also love their peach soda. I also had the mango, kilo, miyagi and ronin burgers., loved them all. Truffle fries and salt & pepper fries are good too. Haven't ordered anything that disappointed me. Oh also, I also liked the pork belly steamed bun. Seriously, what r u waiting for, go to bachi now. 
Tip: avoid going on a weekend, the wait is usually an hour"}
{"text":"Didnt know what to expect.  Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"This place is the spot if you got a burger craving that just can't be fulfilled by any old burger. The atmosphere is modern and clean, the only thing is that if you plan to go on a weekend expect a wait. Great place to take friends and family if you just love a good burger. Only sad part is that each burger you order doesn't come with any fries or a drink. So just be ready to spend about $17-$25 a person. But can't be beat for the price!"}
{"text":"Like many people, I saw this place on Triple D and while I was in Vegas decided to check it out. It delivered. I had my hopes low because some of the spots of DDD that I've been to have not been great, while others have. I had the Shogun burger, which had foie gras and poached pear. For $27, that burger better have been great and it was. Vastly different flavor profile than any burger you've probably ever had. The flavor is so potent too that the flavor was still in my mouth even after I ate breakfast the next morning. Sweet potato fries and garlic fries were definitely great. I don't normally like fries but if they are dressed well and come with really good dipping sauces then I like them. That was the case here. Service was also on point. It reminded me of spots in NYC because the crowd and waiters are kind of hipster, which was cool with me. Definitely different than the strip. It looks like a place that was created and run by young people, but people who still know how to handle a business. I would recommend this place and be back when I'm in Vegas probably for the Shogun burger but I might try something else."}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to the hype. I got the oxtail fries which could've been a meal in itself. So rich, savory and topped with tender oxtail and a friend egg. I ordered the bahn mi burger which was suggested by the server, who was very informative and pleasant. I'm not sure what was on it other than curry aioli but it was probably the best burger I've ever had in my life. It had a sweet element which was a nice contrast to the savoriness of my meal. I've lived by this place for quite some time now and am disappointed that I waited so long to go!"}
{"text":"I was suspicious as the idea of Asian burgers sounded strange, color me converted, these babies rock.  The pineapple ketchup made me wonder why we ever used tomatoes. 

So why not 5 stars?  Coffee was not bottomless as they blew the circuit, though the charge was the same. This led to no milkshakes. 

I suppose what I am saying is that I should return to see if it is 5 star worthy.  I am sure it is."}
{"text":"My favorite is red velvet milkshake. I hope Bachi burger sees my review and bring it back.
My favorite burger...All of them, except for lamb (it was o.k.)
Now they serve ramen."}
{"text":"Farcical. Came in at 2pm. Place was 75% empty. Waited over 5 minutes before being acknowledged, which was being told a group of 5 needed to be seated before my group. Didn't want to wait an hour to eat so I left. 

Food may or may not still be good but when they can't manage the basics like a grown up business it doesn't matter. Won't ever again waste my time here."}
{"text":"I'm dinging this place because the front of house is absolute trash, the food is wonderful but twice in a row now they have lost our place on the waiting list and seated 3+ parties that came in after us before and then when I inquire I watch the host stare at a bunch of illegible chicken scratch and pretend he knew where our name was there is no reason there should be a 45 Minute wait on a Monday next time Ill just go elsewhere which is a crying shame because the food is wonderful
Edit: Chris is an awesome waiter the review is in no way a reflection of the service he provided sit in his section if you can get seated!"}
{"text":"The food here was so good the last time we came by that we decided to try Bachi again on our latest trip.  Unfortunately this time the experience wasn't near as good.  I had the same burger I had last time, (Spicy Miso), but this time the patty was dry and there wasn't much flavor from the apple vinagrette.  My wife had the Bachi fish and her sandwich was much better than mine.

The worst part is that I think I got food poisoning because a couple of hours later I needed to find a bathroom BAD.  I was in Bally's and was hoping to make it back to our room at the Delano but I wasn't going to make it.  Luckily I found a bathroom in Bally's and was able to get some relief.  But I had to stop at bathrooms 2 more times before we made it back to Delano.  I was the only one in our party that had the Wagyu beef so I think that was the culprit."}
{"text":"This awesome Asian fusion burger joint is located about 15 mins from the Strip but worth the travel! 
We dined here on a Saturday evening and was surprisingly seated right away.

The oxtail chili cheese fries was definitely shareable for 2-4 people as an appetizer. I'm for one not a big chili cheese fries to start off with but this was on another level. There was a lot of good flavors but my only complaint would be not enough cheese was on the fries. 

I had the Miyagi-San burger and loved every single Waygu bite! I have always been to burger joints where the egg is on the runny side which I'm not a big fan of but the egg was perfectly cooked the way I like it. The crunchy fried onions were
huge and gave the burger a nice texture in contrast to the soft burger bun. 

I would definitely come back here to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"These Asian fusion burgers are excellent. The different flavor combinations make for delicious burgers. I have tried all of their burgers now, and I am very fond of the Ronan burger. The oxtail chili fries are a must for every visit. You could order this alone and you would leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Trendy and loud on a Thursday night. My wife and I ordered two burgers and swapped 1/2's so we could sample two burgers each!  I had the Kimchee burger. I'll hit this place up again when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had!  Try the Ox Tail Fries, yup, you heard right!!  Just give them a try!!

Japanese twist to the American classic burger. Relaxed and casual ... making it a great antidote to the typical Las Vegas eatery. Oh, and its close to the airport for those that need to dine and skip town."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant, but I never decided to try it until my dad went and raved about it. When I arrived, I was surprised that it was a sit-down restaurant because I associated burgers with fast and casual dining. Nevertheless, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was lovely. The only critique I have to give is that I ordered a bison burger, but they were out of bison. Instead they gave me a wagyu burger without charging me extra for it. I must say, I was extremely disappointed that they didn't have the bison. However, the burger that I did get was fantastic! The beef was juicy, the cheese was perfectly melted, and the fig chutney gave a hint of sweetness. It also included grilled onions, which I loved; and this is coming from someone who normally despises onions. Love the food, love the place. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys upscale burgers."}
{"text":"I came here a a few months ago and it was closer to a 4 star place. The burgers were good and service was friendly and relaxed. The first time I had their Bachi fish burger, I was so impressed I went twice in one weekend, even if the 2nd time wasn't as good as the first. 

I don't know what happened... When we went this past Friday evening, everything was terrible from the service to the food. It wasn't that busy, but somehow no one even bothered to get us water or take our order for more than 10 minutes. The food took forever to come and when it did come, it was unforgivably bad. I ordered the fish burger but it did not even resemble the fish burger I used to crave. The burger pretty much fell apart right on my plate because they just mindlessly piled up the ingredients between two pieces of bun. The fish fillet tasted lukewarm and rubbery with a watery sauce that made the bun soggy. The lettuce inside the burger fell out in a clump as soon as I tried to hold the burger and take a bite, at which point it became more of a tasteless salad without any dressing. I left the clump of \"salad\" alone while I picked through the fish and the soggy bun with a fork. 

I can forgive bad service, but I can't forgive terrible food, and unfortunately this place is only as good as whoever is in the kitchen. One star for the clean decor and memories of once awesome burgers."}
{"text":"Bachi burger does what it does very well... the Kiki burger is incredible. The chili edamame is to die for. The truffle fries are epic. The only downfall is they are incredibly slow. I live within a mile of this place and I would come here all the time if I didn't have to wait 45 minutes for my food. There is usually a wait at the door and I feel if the kitchen expedited a little quicker that would be less of a problem as well. That being said if I am going to eat here I've solved this issue by calling in my order and picking it up on my way home."}
{"text":"Burgers are huge and amazing. Cooked it perfectly. I like it medium and the runny egg on mine was cooked well. Truffle fries are also bomb. Wish I ordered the oxtail chili fries tho. Looked to good!!!! Lonely bird and miyagi San burger. Both were awesome. Definitely coming back. Thank you boyfriend!!!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a little drive from the strip, head towards Henderson. It's not too far but if you don't have a car or don't like to drive out of Vegas, then you're potentially missing out on an awesome meal. Even though this restaurant is away from all the city lights and sounds, it's still pretty well known as it should be. It seemed like a good amount of their customers were locals. Random out of towners like us would pop up probably either by word of mouth or Yelp of course. We arrived around 1-2 pm and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The interior is clean, nothing fancy, simple designs and decorations, but the food is another story.

Service was quite on point. Our waitress was cheery but not overly fake-friendly. She returned numerous of times to check up on us and to make sure our drinks never dipped below half way. Even the manager(s) swung by to ask how everything was. All that was missing was for the chef to come out and greet us which I didn't expect would happen anyways. 

Bachi Burger seems like they're a mix combination of Japanese and Korean entwined with a fusion/gourmet twist. I saw both cultures' ingredients on the menu. To start we ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - with garlic aioli and a fried egg ($11.50). If you haven't figured it out by now, we Asians love to put a fried egg on everything: rice, noodles, burgers, and apparently now chili cheese fries. Forget house fries; order yourself one of these bad boys. You can easily share it between four people but if you're like the Craig R. who orders EIGHT items for two people, then this may not be sufficient. Check what he ordered in his review. The colossal mix was addicting and the skinny fries are a perfect blend. Then again, I'm biased against fat fries. When the server attempted to take the dish away to make room for our main entrees, I caught myself snarling at her because I wanted to eat the remaining four pieces. 

I was seriously stuck in between two places when it came to ordering my burger. Either Kiki's Burger ($9.5) - Angus beef, sautéed shiitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli (doesn't it all sound heavenly) or the Kalbi Burger ($9) - Angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo. The Kalbi Burger won this time, only because Gooch who recommended this place to me told me to try it. Although I have full confidence in the Kiki's Burger, my Kalbi Burger was instant gratification. The mixed blend of Angus and kalbi sauce with the kimchi made me feel like I was eating at a Korean BBQ joint. To knock it out of the park for a grand slam, they should've or maybe I should've asked for them to throw a fried egg in it even though that might have be a little over kill. You can't go wrong with this burger. However, if I was to return I'd like to try Kiki's Burger to compare the two.

I got to sample the Spicy Miso Burger and all I have to say about that is that it's not spicy at all. Also, my Kalbi Burger already had the knock out 1-2 punch so it would be unfair to say that this miso burger was mediocre. At that point, I was already mesmerized with my order.

If you have a car or willing to travel a little out of the Strip, then venture off to Bachi Burger for an appetizing meal. They do close late on the weekends: 2 am, so you have plenty of time to plan your visit. The prices are reasonable, the food is sick (& great presentation), and the service is superb.

Good looking out Gooch Y. for recommending this spot!"}
{"text":"My love for Bachi Burger is for reals. The OG restaurant was so banging that they opened a second location on West Sahara. Now before you think it's going to be a quick commute from the strip, it's really not that close. It's nearly nine miles from the Palazzo hotel. That's a $30 one way cab ride. Unless you don't mind a $60 to and from taxi fare, then I would suggest you come here when you have your own ride. It's situated in the Village Square shopping area right next to the Regal movie theater. It is however closer to the strip then their other location which was closer to Henderson. So if I had to choose between the two, I'd probably come here. Plus this location has a lot more working space especially for our party of 10 on this particular night.

There's no doubt about it that when I think of Bachi Burger, I fantasize about their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50. It's practically a must order and it's a great appetizer to share right out of the gates. Did I mention that is topped with a fried egg? That's how we Asians do it!

Although the Kalbi Burger $9.5 (angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo) is my original go to, I have found a new love. The Ronin Burger $10: angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I'd like to forewarn you that it may be a little on the sweet side but like the Kalbi Burger, it is dripping with greatness. Personally, both of these burgers are neck and neck and if I had to choose between the two, I'd rather rely on a flip of a coin to determine my fate. 

I had their Kiki's Burger $10 on the most previous trip and although it is stacked with lots of awesome ingredients (angus beef, sautéed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, ages gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli), it just didn't measure up to the other burgers I have mentioned. It's not bad but I probably won't order it again. The Banh-Mi Burger is probably my least favorite. I'd rather hit up Banh Mi Che Cali and get a real Vietnamese sandwich. It's a nice attempt but I'll pass.

There are a few other burgers on their menu that deserve a glance like Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. For you non beef types, they have a Crusty Crab burger, an Alaskan Cod burger, a ground chicken and turkey burger, and even a No Meat Here burger. 

Bachi Burger is by far one of my favorite burger joints and this is coming from a guy who has cut back on consuming one of America's favorite bites. The food always seems fresh and full of rich ingredients. The acute tastes leave nothing but awesomeness on your taste buds. The great thing about the post meal is that you walk out satisfied and not overly stuffed or in a complete lethargic state of mind.

Until the next time we meet again Bachi Burger...I'll continue to miss you."}
{"text":"The SALTED CARAMEL MILKSHAKE alone makes me wanna hitch a ride to Vegas. ughhh what do they put in it?! it's layered with flavor. I think Willy Wonka was in the back whipppin 'em up. Seriously. get one. and don't share. haha!

Chili Cheese Oxtail fries? That's whats up. with an egg on top too? yesssssss, please! Crispy fries, well seasoned chilli & the cilantro was refreshing. loved this.

Peking Duck bun- Basically a fancy Siopao but i thoroughly enjoyed all 3 bites :p unlike me, if you can refrain yourself from stuffing the whole thing in your mouth, you deserve a cookie. so good, i couldn't help it! I have to come back to try the pork belly bun. 

Kalbi burger- Medium Rare. High Quality meat that melts in your mouth. (i didnt even know meat could do that?!) The kimchi was a little over powering. I'd probably try a different burger next time. 

Overall, i'll be back! hopefully sooner rather than later ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Bachi Burger on our first night in Las Vegas.  Before going to Las Vegas, I researched this place because I am a huge fan of burgers.

I ordered the Lonely Bird.  I thought the presentation of the burger was simple.  There was nothing too fancy about it.  There was only a toothpick holding the burger in place.  The burger was good and different than most burgers I tasted.  In the Lonely Bird, the patty is chicken and turkey.  Weird?  Yes, but it was fairly tasty.   I really like the taste of the sweet bun.  It was different, but yummy.  Regarding the truffle parmesan fries, I had better, but the taste was decent.  Personally, order one batch of fries because the serving was fairly large.  

My boyfriend and I ordered mango boba milk tea.  It tasted sooo good.  It was just as good as the one I ordered in the Philippines.  For dessert, I ordered some type of walnut apple dessert.  The presentation was great, but the taste was meh.  

Our server, Lance, reminded me of Justin Long.  He was helpful and made suggestion in our order
.  
Overall, I would not mind coming here again and trying out other burgers.  They sound and look appetizing."}
{"text":"Flavorful!! Oh So FLAVORFUL.

Sunday evening-- Arrived around 6:45PM. No reservations needed.. although the place started to get busier by 7:00PM and seems like Han (who was great) was serving upwards of 7 tables simultaneously.

Everything at Bachi Burger, this Asian fusion burger restaurant, has so much taste. We made the fortunate mistake of ordering too much food-- thus having lunch for the next day.

1. Crispin Blackberry Apple Cider- Delicious tasting juice alcohol.

2. Oxtail chili cheese fries- Fries are crispy and good. It's a huge plate-- heavy enough to be a meal in itself or shareable between 4 people. It tastes just like chili cheese fries with shredded beef rather than ground beef. I think I would've rather gotten the bone marrow because I wanted that unusual meaty taste.

3. Pork Belly Bao Buns- I wanted only 1 but ended up with 3 (due to my lack of ordering clarity). They were delicious. The bun is soft and the cole slaw cuts nicely into the overall taste.

4.Risotto Loco Moco- I ordered this expecting the typical patty (Bachi style) drenched in gravy and a light risotto. When I say their food has so much flavor-- this is what I'm talking about in particular. Their patty is deliciously charred with the sweet, signature Bachi Burger taste. The onions are plenty and a good supplement (although there were too many onions for my taste). The egg and the scallions were a good top off. I also liked the risotto--- but not with this dish. Since the patty and everything on top is super tasty.. the risotto (and its cheesiness) was too much and out of place. I would have preferred plain white rice with the meal. The risotto is great-- but perhaps pair it with another protein or one not marinated so heavily.

Had the opportunity to enter their Disneyland giveaway by posting a photo of my food on facebook. I'm definitely a fan and enjoy coming here every so often."}
{"text":"Burgers will never seem the same after having a Bachi burger. The pickles and fries were special too. Joe provided great service and suggestions. The other servers were also attentive. Wish we had this place in Orlando!!  We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This place was a little over-hyped for me.

First thing first.  The wait was around 30min-40min on a Sunday (lunch time). Anyways, the host comes out lets people know there is open sitting at the bar and we immediately go in.  The hosts disappears, so we ask the manager if we could sit at the bar cause it was open sitting (just to make sure), but he tells us to wait and he'll ask the host.  We wait, until two gentlemen behind us, just walk and take those two seats at the bar. WTF? Kind of pissed off, the host eventually comes and we tell her our story and she says there is nothing she can do (-____-).  Keep in mind the MANAGER probably forgot to ask the host, cause she didn't even have a clue.  We get the manager and he eventually finds us a seat at the bar.....

Anyways. The FOOD:

Miyagi Sans Grass fed Wagyu Burger  - Furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. Pretty good, but not the best burger though. We asked for a medium, but the burger was almost well done...

Ronin Burger - Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, with some type of aoili on the side. This burger was ok. Not what I expected. The caramelized onions were a little too sweet and there were tons of it on the burger.

Oxtail chili cheese fries - The chili was a bit on the sweeter side, not your typical \"chili\", but it was different.  This was very filling, try to split with someone. 

Maybe next time I'll try the pork buns, since I heard it was good... but who knows."}
{"text":"First thing I ate after landing in Vegas.  Totally worth the 8 hour trip from the East Coast.  We got here around 9pm on a Wednesday and there was no wait.  

I had the Ronin Burger.  Japanese cole slaw, caramelized onions, and a fried egg on a burger.  I think I destroyed the burger within a few minutes and it was a decent size.  Every burger shop should add fried eggs on their burgers.  It was sweet and refreshing.  Maybe a little too sweet for my liking, but overall a good burger.  My buddy had the Miyagi-san burger.  With the onion rings, the burger looked massive.  The furikake (seasoning) went very well with the burger.  I had a bite of the burger and the taste still lingered as we walked back to our car.  Next time I'm getting this burger.   

As a pork bun enthusiast, I naturally had to order them.  I like Bachi Burger's version of the steam pork bun.  The bun was not soft and fluffy but the pork, egg, and herbs totally blew my mind.  Like I said earlier, eggs should be added be everything.

I'm very glad I went here after my flight.  Totally worth the food coma while driving 3 hours to Zion National Park."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great fries. Love their Lonely Bird, bachi burger, fries with truffle parmesan. Be prepared to wait as this place is gaining in popularity with new hours and a steady clientele. We were there for lunch this week and waited close to 30 minutes for our food to finally come out. Bachi also likes to charge for every little thing...$1.00 for extra sauce, $1.50 for cheese (1 slice) on your burger and $1.75 for one onion ring to add to your burger... really I don't think Sysco Foods your supplier charges that much for cheese & onions to justify that charge. Delicious mouthwatering  burgers but getting nickeled and dimed for everything is a bit hard to swallow. Staff could also be given more authority to make customers happy instead of always having to defer to management for approval. Love ya Bachi but please be more reasonable with your pricing."}

{"text":"One word:

Ridiculousness.

I already knew Bachi Burger was amazing before their appearance on Triple D, but they really have outdone themselves with one of their newest burgers.

But first! The appetizers!

I had the oxtail chili cheese fries for the first time. The chili is sweet unlike the norm. And I liked the spicy mayo-like sauce that was drizzled with it. Lots of flavor and definitely filling. Make sure you share this one!

I also had their pork belly steamed buns. A nice thick, tender piece of pork belly in every white, fluffy bun. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but the sweet hoisin-like sauce was the best. I could drink that.

Now onto the main attraction! I saw their Shogun burger written on their chalkboard of specials and I knew I had to have it. A burger made with a wagyu beef patty, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and miso butter with a Yamamomo peach as a palette cleanser. 

They had me at foie gras.

I come from Cali where the delicacy was recently banned, so I was all in with this burger!

You start off with the Yamamomo peach which looks more like a piece of lychee. It's the sweetest piece of fruit you'll probably ever have. Good stuff.

After you take one bite of the burger, you'll feel like eating it slowly so you can savor each bite. The saltiness from the foie gras enhances the sweetness of the pear and unagi. And there's also a hint of truffle oil on the top of the bun. The combination sounded weird at first, but all the flavors really work together. Probably the best burger I've EVER had, but it has a hefty price of $25... WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.

If you love foie gras and burgers, you definitely have to try it. Share it with someone if you have to. Just make it work!

By the way, there always seems to be a wait here, so don't starve yourself too much before you get there (like I did). You need to be awake to try this ridiculousness. 

I can't wait for them to open up their next location in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Prologue:
My girlfriend and I like to stay at an RV park on the south end of the Strip, which is right down the street from this restaurant. We usually arrive in town right around supper time, so this place made perfect sense as our first stop for some nourishment after a long drive up from Tucson. 

The Plot:
We started by sharing some Peking Style Duck Steamed (Bao, a.k.a. Fold-Over) Buns followed by a Kiki's Burger cooked medium.

The Scene:
The portion sizes were good and just right for the two of us.

The buns were tasty with a nice combination of flavors and textures and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.

The burger was perfectly prepared with a nice crust on the outside, cooked evenly throughout, tender, juicy, and had great flavor.
The bacon and caramelized onions were also cooked perfectly, very tasty, and enhanced the flavor of the meat quite nicely. 

The Rest of the Story:
I appreciate that the fact that poultry is much more flavorful when served slightly under done.
However, the duck meat in one of the buns was rather chewy and probably should have been cooked more thoroughly.
I would have also expected more crispy skin in a dish called Peking Style Duck.

We thought the amount of greens served in the burger was a bit too generous. There are better ways to make a burger sandwich look tall when serving.
For example, we expected the portion of meat in a specialty burger to be bigger and thicker than it was, especially when you consider that this sandwich was served with no side dishes.

Epilogue:
The service was prompt and courteous; however it was somewhat overbearing. We ended up having to tell three different wait staff a total of four times that we were still working on our meal and not yet ready to have our plates cleared away.

Although we expect the prices at restaurants in Las Vegas to be higher than in Tucson, we still thought that this restaurant was somewhat overpriced considering it's off the Strip and caters to mostly locals.

{"text":"It was a Saturday night and a group of 9 of us decided to get together and catch up. Haven't been to Bachi in a long time so we decided on dinner around 7. It was definitely busy for a weekend, but that was to be expected.  The host took down our name and quoted an estimated time of seating to be around 15-20 minutes. We waited patiently, the host did a great job controlling the flow of the restaurant and seated us right around the quoted wait time.  

We sat down and Jade greeted us with a smile. She was friendly, prompt, and professional. Some of us had not been there before, so she went through the menu and addressed all the questions that some of us had. She suggested some cocktails and drinks along with her favorites on the menu. We proceeded with some shared appetizers and that arrived, we ordered our entrees. We loved the fact that everyone was served at the same time with entrees and our drinks were constantly filled. Jade checked up on us frequently and was very engaging, yet she let us have our space when needed. Since there was 9 of us, a good variation of the menu was ordered. The ramen I had was perfect! Not too salty, not to spicy, it was perfect! Everyone who ordered burgers was touting how well it was prepared and the cocktails were a hit. We loved that the manager Erika not only came by to say hello and check up on us, but she is every engaging with the entire restaurant.  She even ran some of our food to our table.

At the end of our night, dessert was ordered. Can't remember what we had but it was wonderful, definitely satisfied our sweet tooth! Jade asked if we wanted split checks for such a large party, we declined but was pleasantly surprised that the check was already split based on seating position. Not only was it split in each seating position, it was done correctly. We were impressed not just but the deliciousness of the food, the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, but also the staff. They were all friendly and definitely was a hit with everyone. We will for sure see you all soon! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Way over priced, terrible customer service and to top it off my son got food poisoning not sure if it was the undercooked meat or the undercooked egg. It was a to go order for over 35.00 for 2 burgers. I tried calling to inform them about my son getting I'll but the phone just rang so two days later when my son was well enough to be left alone I went into the restaurant to advise them of my sons illness and wanted to know if anyone else was sick. The manager was a young kid that obviously had little experience. He said he had not heard of anyone getting sick. Then when I asked why the don't pick up there phone he said it's broken. He offered no refund (I had my receipt) nor did he ask how my son was feeling. Nothing but a blank look on his face. I walked out and will never go back.  DQ offers better food and deals!"}
{"text":"It's a casual burger joint with two tvs showing food network and cooking channels.  The hostess and the waitresses were very friendly.  We ordered the Ronin Burger with Wagyu and we both loved the taste!  My wife hates the beef taste, but she thought it was mild plus the pickled veggies counteracted the beef taste very well.  So that's a HUGE thumbs up for the meat...
We ordered the truffle fries and if you love them crunchy, then these are the ones for you.  We finished the huge cone very quickly as a result.
The last thing we ate was the pork belly bun.  It was SOOO tender and moist, and the bun is very light and fluffy, very similar to the buns used for Peking duck.  We actually had to fight for the third piece, but finally resolved to \"split\" it... meaning she had 3/4 of it while I got a small dot of meat and a little bun... hehe
I figured by then, everything should be delicious here, so I ordered the Portuguese donuts for a dessert.... ehh.  I didn't care for it,. The outside was good and crunchy with the cinnamon and sugar coating.  But unfortunately, the taste didn't permeate into the inside.  So it was just doughy... and not even fluffy doughy but very dense.  I wouldn't order it again.
But overall, I would definitely recommend this awesome burger joint and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it.  We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker.

I got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty.  Burgers and service were good.  Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again."}
{"text":"A great place for asian infusion!    Everything is DELISH!    
The only downfall is service is a little slow and unorganized, so come with your patience and it will be well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of my go to spots, but recently they've been slacking. The quality of the food has diluted and the service is down the drains.

After ordering, my group(3) sat for 30min before anyone noticed we still haven't received our food. We also noticed that a couple seated after us got their food almost immediately.

I'm not sure if it's like this at the other locations, but I'll most likely not return to this one."}
{"text":"The hubs and I stopped in a while ago after reading the reviews.

The food is definitely worth it.  Service, maybe not so much.

We had the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (OMG YUM!!!), the Bachi Burger, and the Ronin.  All of them were so good!!

Docking one star for the service, but the food was top notch."}
{"text":"seen this place on triple D so i was like im going to try it when i get to vegas. very clean restaurant was the first thing i noticed started off with the crunchy wings which were GREATNESS! now let me tell you about the ox tail fries i was in a food coma half way through them the meat was nice and tender and fries nice and crisp i was not disappointed at all from this place anytime i am in vegas this will be first place i stop even before my hotel."}
{"text":"Server told me I didn't order sweet potato fries but i did and then the fucker tried charging it to the bill and he was rude about it. shitty customer service oh fa sho
 I ordered the lonely bird and it was truly disgusting they took forever to make it too and no other customers were there i'm disgusted this spot is all HYPE peace bitches

in&out gang por vida"}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago with some friends . Only reason I am going with 3 stars is they had really good burgers , loved the fries but my burger was not so hot. Otherwise it would have gotten a 4 or 5 star. I got the Kiki burger . We were told the chef prefers medium which I went yay its what I prefer. So I got mine medium and the guys got theirs medium rare and medium. Let me warn you. Medium is not or at least for the person cooking that night a light pink. It was a lot closer to medium rare. Almost redish pink all the way through. I couldn't wait to try it since I adore mushrooms and a good mushroom burger. Its one of my favorite three things in the world to eat. My friend ate here all the time and just raved about it so I figured it had to be good. 

When I cut the burger in half to start eating it I took a bite and went omg I can't eat it, it tastes almost raw. We called the server over told them it was to rare and found out that's what was considered medium here. So I asked for a medium well. While the guys ate their burgers. (both graciously offered to wait for mine to be made which I said no eat) I munched on the fries we ordered. Sweet potato fries probably one of the two best I have ever had. Yummy dipping sauce, crunchy on the outside and creamy middle. The truffle fries .... all I can say is so good and addictive. Salt and Pepper ate one but had to stop due to the peppers on it. :(  

After a few minutes my burger came back out and much to my shock it was the same burger cut in half with a bite missing where I had taken a bite. Not wanting to cause issues I shrugged and ate it. Now i am sure had it not been cut in half it would have been wonderful (and less icky thinking of it going back on the grill and back onto my plate) not just good. Anyone who cooks knows you can't cut open a piece of meat and re-grill it without losing most of it juiciness. My friend had the Mister Ho and the other had the Miyagisan. Both looked really good and had rave reviews from them. I will end up going back to try once more. Hoping it is better next time."}
{"text":"I loved the Burgers here.  Fries and onion rings are great too."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. The oxtail cheese fries were crazy and delicious and the burgers (Miyagi and a custom) were killer. The craft beer list was very strong and the staff was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the food 2 stars for the ambiance. This burger had to rate in top 5 most delicious burgers I have ever sank my teeth into! The oxtail chili cheese fries were outstanding as well and really filled me up with plenty to share with our group (party of 4). What I didn't expect was the strip mall location with a simple dining room. Nothing fancy as I think Denny's is even a little nicer ambiance. I really think they could class the joint up a bit for the awesome quality of food they serve. It was kind of a mismatch in my mind. The prices are reasonable though and the food is top rate. If you're a burger lover and you want a decent price then definitely visit this off strip location. You taste buds and your wallet will thank you. Regardless of ambiance it is a must try burger! P.S. Service and wait staff also very pleasant and accommodating! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place from several people, so I was excited to try it out once I finally got around to going. I went on a Saturday night around 6:30pm, and there was no wait at all. They serve Asian style burgers, and ramen. I decided to go with a spicy miso ramen, and boy was that hot! It was delicious! The staff were attentive, and if you needed something, they have an open space in the front where you can walk up and ask anyone for help! I'll definitely be going back to try out the burgers."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING BURGER EXPERIENCE
My group was waffling between Gordon Ramsey's BurGR and Bachi Burger.  Having been to BurGR, we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.  However, this was a HUGE disappointment.

We started our experience with the often-raved oxtail fries.  Although they were tasty, the fries were not crisp and were \"eh.\"  [Not certain if the oil was old or exactly why the potatoes were borderline soggy other than the chili on top of it.]  The taste was good, but if the fries were actually crispy, it would've been great.

My friend ordered a chocolate and peanut butter shake.  As shake consumers, we LOVE shakes.  However, this one lacked flavor.  In fact, you could barely taste both the chocolate and peanut butter.  [My friend barely sipped her shake so I sampled it wondering why it was almost untouched.]

As for the burgers - the main attraction - we shared two different burgers:   Kim Chee burger and Kiki's burger.  The Kim Chee burger was plain and was essentially kim chee and jalapenos thrown onto the burger.  Kiki's was tasty with carmelized onions and the and gruyere cheese, however, there was a sauce - korean mayo? - that did not pair with the burger taste.

I will say that the hamburger buns are fantastic, but that's about it.

If you are into burgers, I would suggest that you journey to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR.  You will not be disappointed by their menu, food quality and taste.  Bachi was okay, but certainly not at those prices for ala carte burgers.  Even In and Out burgers are more satisfying and at only a fraction of the cost and time.

DON'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must if you are visiting.  I bring friends and family here whenever they are in town and it never disappoints!  The Miyagi-San Burger is my usual choice because of the blend of flavors from the carmelized bacon on top of a Waygu beef patty to the stacked onion rings and fried egg.  Oxtail Fries make for a delicious start to the meal and the Bone Marrow Jam adds a subtle savoriness to the flavor explosion.  The Pork Belly Steamed Buns are another delicious choice either as a side or as a meal.  If given the option, be sure to upgrade to the Waygu Beef on your burger, you will be glad you did!  And the staff are great at offering helpful suggestions that make your meal even better!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Bachi. Great burgers! Our server was very helpful explaining and describing the menu to us. Shuffle fries are good as well."}
{"text":"I've visited Bachi Burger sporadically for a few years now and have highly enjoyed their burgers, oxtail fries, and ramen (after meshing with Shoku Ramen). I recently dined at the restaurant and was disappointed to find that Bachi Burger no longer lived up to its glory. 

Besides the fact that our burgers came out more rare than what we ordered (medium) the service/wait was what let us down. Hard to enjoy your dining experience when your table seems non existent to the servers. It was a Friday night and they did seem busy/short staffed (I spotted about 3 servers or so) but when it takes over 15 minutes for someone to come by your table after being seated then 35+ minutes for your burgers to come out (basically raw so I'm not sure why the wait was so long - we were so hungry we ate the edible edges) it can really cause a damper on your meal. The taste was still what I remembered (great flavor) and the servers still friendly - just incredibly busy and not as attentive as we'd like.

My experience wasn't worth the wait for our food and drinks. Just because I know how wonderful they once were and can be I'm still hopeful for Bachi Burger. Maybe they'll staff heavier in the future and if I ever return, I should definitely choose to on a slower weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"Good food great old school hip hop high ass prices....definitely different items ..like ox tail fries,  different."}
{"text":"Food is still amazing. Chef is innovative and creates beautiful, delicious food. Problem is you'll wait 10 min to see hostess, 20 min to get seated, 30 min for food AND THE PLACE IS HALF EMPTY!  servers are running around ragged. BUT food keeps me coming back every time. Just don't go in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Overhyped and filthy. Flies are everywhere and tables were dirty and sticky. 

The miyagi-san burger was completely burnt and black.... tasted like kalbi, too. This clearly means that the grill has not been cleaned and my burger was cooked with someone's kalbi burger. 

Coke was not carbonated and completely flat.

Service was horrible, but the people working there were friendly.  However, I never received an apology of why their patty was completely burnt, not cooked \"medium\", and tasted like kalbi when I didn't order a kalbi burger.

For two burgers, oxtail fries, a flat soda, and a bottle of beer, we paid over $50.  Definitely not worth your trip out.  

If I had to pick a gourmet burger to eat at in vegas, it would be at Gordon Ramsay's BURGR Bar in PH."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. While the creative parings and toppings were high quality and tasty the taste of the meat in the burger was a bit lacking.

We ordered the sausage app, the sausages were tasty, served with a nice whole grain mustard. They were just sausages really, nothing special. We also had the chili chicken, that was pretty tasty.

I had the Spicy Miso burger and it was spicy! My sinuses started to clear just from smelling it but not too hot to bear. It was tasty but again I was disappointed with the flavor if the meat itself. The meat was a bit bland, hard and dry. I got the impression that it was a frozen wagyu patty. So while the overall burger was good, it was more like I had all these tasty toppings, sauce and spices wrapped around a bland burger. 

I give Bachi props for the unique creation of an Asian/Burger fusion and the creative tastes but in the end an inferior or frozen beef patty will bring a good burger down and ultimately why I couldn't give them 4 stars.

One tip if you get one of the burgers with a fried egg, be careful with the over medium egg..... Bite the wrong way and you could have a blast of hot liquid yolk shoot all over you! LOL"}
{"text":"A friend of a friend recommended this place and what a treat to find it to be as good as they exclaimed.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The place was busy but there wasn't an overly long wait.  We had the Kiki burger with Wagyu and the Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger with a shared order of truffle fries.  The burgers were cooked (per chef's recommendation) perfectly and the homemade buns melted in your mouth.  This is not a fast food style restaurant and is a bit pricy, but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Bachi Burger really gets it right when it comes to burgers and fries.

I have been waiting to go to Bachi for awhile. Just waiting for that perfect moment to spend $10+ on a burger. Yes, it is a tad expensive, but honestly it is worth it when you decide to jump in. 

Overall the experience was spot-on and the food was pretty much perfect. I had the Miyagi-San Burger, grass-fed Wagyu beef, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings, and I added cheddar cheese for an additional charge. This burger came out perfectly, the bun glistened, the egg oozed, the onion rings were crispy, and the cheese was melted perfectly. The beef is high quality, the grilling to medium-well done very nicely. The flavors all work together to make it truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.

My friend and I also shared the Grilled Shishito Peppers, which are sweet and tasty, with a bit of char. And the sweet potato fries - long-cut, skinny, deliciously sweet and salty as the same time - not one soggy one in the bunch! I highly recommend these fries if you like sweet potatoes!

Also of note - they have a good happy hour, with food and drinks. I had a white wine for only 3 bucks, and it was a decent one at that.

Highly recommended - and my personal return factor is a definite YES."}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on a Yelp search for a place to eat off strip since I had a rental car on this trip.  Easy to find and plenty of parking.  Service was quick and friendly.  The burger I ordered was really good.  It is not huge but it had plenty of flavor and I devoured it pretty quickly.  It was a little messy but very good.  The fries were also really good and you get a nice portion.  Definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I've heard about Bachi Burger on \"diners, drive ins and dives\" on food network and finally went today. It exceeded my expectations and it is what I consider to be the best burger in town. Seriously it was so delicious and there were lots of options to choose from. I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers !  I had the Kiki burger and it was the best tasting burger I've had in my whole life.  The service was excellent. I drove from Arizona, over 90 miles to eat at Bachi Burger and it was worth every mile !"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and the food has always been great, except for the last two times. They have run out of the Veggie burger and the Lonely bird burger, which is my wife's favorite. Fire your buyer!  My truffle parmesan fries have been served cold and overcooked, which I always look forward to. It seems that the price of fame (featured on Diners, Drive-ins and dives) has caught up to them. Time to find a new fav burger joint. A plus.....the staff is always friendly, but that's not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Their Momotaro strawberry white peach soda is crack! It's been two days and I'm still thinking about it and wishing for more! I WANT IT, I NEED IT, NOW!!!!!! too bad I live in California :(

- Oxtail chili cheese fries: Perfectly fried fries topped with sweet oxtail chili, jalepenos, fried egg, and cilantro. The chili was a little too sweet as if there was too much bbq sauce, but still good! 

- Pork Belly Steamed Sandwiches: Glazed pork belly, hardboiled egg, and cilantro stuffed in a steamed bun. YUM, although the bun could've been a little softer.

- Miyagi-san grass-fed wagyu burger: grass-fed beef patty, cheese, onion rings in toasted buns. I loved that this came out hot and steamy! Although the beef patty was cooked to medium-well even though I asked for medium, it was still very juicy. However, I felt that it lacked flavor and I wished the onion rings would have been crunchy to give the burger more texture.

I would definitely come back here again because it has so many burgers that sound delicious! However, I give this four stars because I think they could've done with all their entrees."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the Wagyu Ronin burger and .5 stars for the Oxtail fries.

Friend was hypin this place up especially the infamous Oxtail fries.  Ordered it and expected a chunk of oxtail meat on top of the fries but instead, they skimped on the oxtail and it the oxtail was a chili base, so pretty much it tasted exactly like chili cheese fries which did not impress.  Even the fried egg didn't make a difference.  Manager was nice enough to explain the oxtail confusion and gave us an extra plate of the chili based oxtail.

To make up for the fries, the Ronnin Wagyu burger was amazing.  All the toppings came together exceptionally well and you can very much taste the difference in the Wagyu beef when compared to your angus beef and what not.

Now waiting for a SoCal location to open up."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE BACHI! Every time we go the food is on POINT. I miss the chili fried chicken but still an amazing spot."}
{"text":"Food - great!
Service - SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Price - over!

Me and my hubby tried Bachi Burger for lunch today.  We got the water but no straws and the waiter was too busy to hear us ask for it.  We ordered Kalbi burger and Kiki burger along with side of Shrimp fries. 

The Shrimp fries are basically veggie chips kinda thingy with shrimp flavors for $2.75 we got about 7 chips on the plate...really! That was pretty disappointing!

Our burgers took about 30 plus minutes to arrive...but the flavors were awesome!

Good place if you have too much time on hand and okay to spend little more than average burger place."}
{"text":"I just arrived in Vegas today but went straight to this place for a to-go order. This place is great! The waiter that took my order was super nice and helpful. The wait was speedy and order was complete. I got a \"black and green\" burger and sweet potato fries with the porchinj cream sauce. The burger was spectacular, no need for condiments for it was super flavorful! The fries were delish!!! I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat. Laid back too! Shorts and hats were worn by many although it was a Sunday."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious. Great atmosphere. Lacked in good service.
Try the oxtail chili cheese fries. They are delicious. We also had the garlic edamame and that too was yummy. 
The burgers have a unique taste so just go in with an open mind and try them how they come."}
{"text":"First and second bite was good. But after that realized they forgot to put avocado and the burger was way too well done when I asked for medium well. When I pointed it out they still charged me for extra avocado and didn't take care of it. Service wasn't good and burger wasn't great either. Ended up spending $50. Never going here again."}
{"text":"This place the Hamburger is the bomb!!!!
The banh mi hamburger is also the bomb!!!
There drink signature drink are really refreshing and the bomb!!! (:
The place is always packed unless you go there Hellas late like 12midnight....
The service is good the people there are pretty nice and polite.
I will miss this place cause im leaving back to kali):...."}
{"text":"Went to eat there after watching a movie. The place was clean so that was a plus. We were seated right away and was given the menu right away.  Our waiter took so long  to take our order.  It's not as though they were busy. The couple that arrived 10 minutes after we were seated, had their order taken and their food arrived just as our waiter was taking our order.  My daughters ordered  burgers and  fries.  The burgers were huge. Presentation was really nice.  The truffle fries with Parmesan tasted weird. There was some kind of sauce over the fries.   The price for the burgers were reasonable for gourmet burgers, French fries, I think we're over priced. Overall experience was just okay."}
{"text":"My friends and I all ordered burgers.  
Three  of the four burgers were under cooked and were actually raw inside.
We would had asked them to be cooked more but the waitress never came back and when she did she was very rude and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"This is for take out orders - don't do it! Less than 10 minutes between restaurant and hotel, food was cold. Spicy ramen was tasty, but burgers were not impressive. I think the experience may have been different had we eaten in."}
{"text":"stopped in for a quick lunch around noon, place was empty???
good timing on our part, restaurant began to fill up after we ordered!

started with a basic Sapporo beer, friend had iced green tea, which she said was excellent!
ordered the bone marrow appetizer, was pretty good, came with foie gras butter, YUM
could have used a couple extra pieces of toast though.....definitely would order again

friend had ronin burger...sorry, I think that was it, was good, nothing memorable
I chose the bachi fish sandwich....SCORE!!!
I really enjoyed this, as it was pan seared, not fried
my friend tried and that's probably what made her burger secondary
really guys, well worth a try, unless you do not like fish

had salt and pepper fries to accompany, good as always, nice crisp, fresh....

only bad thing...out of portuguese donuts for dessert....oh well, next visit
you can count on there being a return visit soon!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD
BELOW AVERAGE SERVICE / Experience

After 4 visits to Bachi over 2 months, two certainties - the food is great, the service and atmosphere is not.  Really nothing on the menu is not superb, but, the restaurant has a consistent \"we are too busy for you\" vibe, and it seems to be impacting some quality.

The good:

Perfectly cooked meats, and very flavorful blends. Even their turkey/chicken burger combo is seasoned well.  All the speciality burgers (we tried 6 different ones over the visits) blended nicely as presented.  You don't have to do much to modify, and we recommend trying as is to get the full experience.

The bad:

From the moment you walk in, this place is not welcoming. They seem to have the wait staff double as greeters, and they are almost always none to happy to see you come in.  Expect no greeting, and even if the place is half empty, expect to wait. Its their thing to put on a list - and they know nothing less then 15 minutes.

The place is lacking severely in a \"boss.\"  The staff is one of the most poorly trained across the board for a restaurant so popular.  Expect to sit for a while, have to chase the staff for drink refills, more ketchup or sauce for items, your check, etc.  The first time we thought it was an aberration, but, on every trip the same experience.  They are understaffed, and its odd but for always having a wait they do a terrible job of keeping tables turning.  While waiting one time (for 25 minutes) we saw two tables that could have been sat 15 minutes earlier trying to flag down a wait person to pay.

The fries were cold every time we ordered them. They either are sitting too long, or they don't have proper heat staging.  They don't put any condiments on the tables, and provide a small amount in crucibles.  This was rather annoying (also to other guests) we had to ask to get more, further stressing the wait staff who were trying to do it all.

They have poor support for the wait staff - odd that management hasn't figured out 2-3 bus staff can help them bring in 3X that cost in more revenue. 

Bottom line - go with expectations that your atmosphere and service are subpar, but you get one of the best burgers in Vegas.  Bachi isn't after giving you a great dining experience, none of the staff are what you normally expect with the Vegas service quality (which is typically one of the best in the country - Vegas is about service).  Oh - and the lobby is the worst.  Room for 6 people, so you kind of have to linger in the \"smokers zone\" while you wait or just stand in the \"holding cell.\""}
{"text":"This off-the strip burger joint is a hidden gem for those visiting Vegas.  I came here based on a few of my friends' recommendation and rave reviews of this place and I was not disappointed.

We were seated within 5 minutes during lunchtime.  Our group of 5 we got:  Bachi Burger (wagyu), Kiki Burger, Duck Bao, Short Rib Bao, and the oxtail chili fries.

I pretty much liked everything I ate.  The oxtail chili had lots of beans in it, which some of my friends didn't like as much, but I thought they were fine.

I think the burgers are better than the bao's though, so stick to those.  The parmesean truffle fries are good, but not spectacular, I've had better truffle fries.

The pricing is just right, everything is in the 7-12 dollars range or so, so pretty cheap for the delicious food.

Highly recommended place to check out to or leaving vegas!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a great place for hamburgers. The flavors are tasty and distinctive.
The term gourmet hamburger is often over-used. I think anyone who aspires to make something better than a Big Mac will call it a gourmet burger. But the term really applies at Bachi Burger. It's first-rate ingredients prepared with great care, most with an Asian influence.
I got the pickle plate appetizer, the mushroom cheeseburger, the salt-and-pepper fries and a soda they make in-house with cherry and some sort of Japanese fruit.
As soon as the pickle plate comes you know the owner is a friend of foodies. There's little bites of six separate things, all quite interesting. My two favorites were the daikon radish and the garlic.
The pepper in the salt-and0pepper fries are jalapenos. They're not too spicy. When the fries arrived they reminded me of a pepper-infused crab dish at Yummy Yummy in San Francisco. Interesting smells. And they tasted great. I got the pineapple ketchup o go with the fries but it didn't do much for me. The garlic aoili sauce was pretty good.
The burger was great. The black angus beef was first rate and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I loved all the different mushrooms they put on the burger. The gruyere cheese was tasty. And the bun was good, too.
Maybe the only disappointment was the soda. I was hoping for something with some zingy acidity to match the rich foods, but it was a little flat. I wished I had tried a lime soda instead.
Bachi Burger is quite distinctive and certainly worth the trip south of The Strip., It's about 1.6 miles east of Interstate 15 at the Blue Diamond Road exit."}
{"text":"If the off-Strip food scene of Las Vegas is destined to emulate the original neighborhood restaurants that make up the great American food cities, then Bachi Burger is one of the quirky places that will help pave the way. With Asian-inspired burgers, house-made Japanese pickles, and boba milk teas alongside delicate salads, truffle fries, and Portugese donuts, it appears the chef is a bit scatter-brained, but almost all of his creations are well-balanced and skillfully executed.

The juicy burgers are served on grilled sweet rolls - a unique approach. The more creative burgers are better than the plain versions, though I wasn't crazy about 'The Crusty Crab.' The sweet chutney was quite tasty, but there wasn't enough textural complexity so the soft crab cake and soft bun ended up tasting mushy in tandem. I really enjoyed 'Kiki's Burger' with sautéed Shiitake &amp; Eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and a garlic chili aioli on the side ($8, pictured above), as well as 'The Lonely Bird,' made from ground chicken and turkey topped with herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and onion ($7.50). I'm not sure about soy alongside pesto (soy is in all the burgers), but the patty was juicier than most beefless burgers I've had.

The salads are light and fresh, though they are a little too upscale for a burger joint and therefore fairly expensive for their size. The oriental chicken salad with organic jidori chicken breast was my favorite ($9), but maybe that's just because it went better with the theme of the restaurant. I love the Japanese pickles that change regularly, and for $3 they make the perfect amuse. The garlic butter and truffle edamame ($3) and crispy sweet potato fries with yuzu citrus aioli ($4) are worth ordering, but pass on the shrimp toasts which are more interesting on paper than on a plate.

Once Bachi Burger refines a few of their menu items and improves the vibe of the space, I believe it will become very successful. The prices are right and you won't find food like it elsewhere in Vegas, so it's on my list of recommended restaurants."}
{"text":"Okay, so much hype, so I had to see for myself.  I warned my other half in advance that it wasn't the BOGO of Montana Meat Co., and it also wasn't going to include fries.  I'm big on self-preservation.

What I didn't know was how big and unpreposessing the place was going to be, with its abundance of unadorned tables and lack of any decor save for some modernistic Asian-influenced \"art\" on the walls.  Kinda like \"Decor by Bed, Bath and Beyond\" on sale (and don't forget those 20% off coupons).  You can eat the ambience, and my appetite wasn't getting all that stimulated.

Luckily, the burgers were excellent (we both had Ronins, medium).  They had a Pear Cider special for $4, so we had a couple of those, and shared an order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries.  We liked the aioli that came along with that, but the dressing for the burger worked as a dipping sauce, too.  

When the burgers were delivered, I didn't see how I was going to bite into that gargantuan creation, but figured out quickly that if I press down and hold the chrome-dome top of the bun, I could compress it enough so that I didn't have to eat with with knife and fork.  That would have been way too difficult, since no forks were provided, just one serrated knife to share, presumably to cut the burger in half.  

While we enjoyed our burgers and fries and the service was excellent, Bachi is somehow missing that je ne sais quois that would compel us to return on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great little spot in a random strip mall but come hungry. Portions are very big but for a very reasonable price. Oxtail fries were on point especially with the egg on top. The burger was good but nothing too great the caramelized bacon was not too my liking and made the burger a little too sweet. Will come back again to try other menu options. Potato salad was the best I have ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent gourmet burger. It was recommended by a friend, and while I like burgers, I'm no connoisseur of burgers. I didn't expect this place to be amazing. I was very favorably whelmed, not overwhelmed, but it was a pleasant surprise. I'll go back. It's a great burger, for a reasonable price. Crowded...but you have to expect that the crowd is gonna go to the good food."}
{"text":"Burger GODS~  Flew in from Minnesota to have a burger, worth the flight!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here because I heard so much about it being one of the best burger places in the US.  The wait was a bit long on a Sunday night (which surprised me).  Staff were very efficient seating people, and the service was great.  After a nice glass of wine, I tried the Mr. Ho burger (Hawaiian).  It was pretty good after you got over the purple (taro) bun, but the flavors did not wow. Next time I will try the Korean version. The sausages appetizer was interesting, and worthwhile if you want some extra meat.  I recommend skipping the salad (overpriced and pedestrian), and the truffle/parmesan fries.  The truffle gravy had no truffle taste, and actually made the French Fries soggy - I recommend the plain fries instead. Overall, the food was good, but not out-of this-world.  However, the bill was - $45 for a burger meal....only in LV!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed in this place. We decided to try this place out on our way through Vegas because of all the great reviews and we were craving burgers. Seemed like they had a great concept but just didn't satisfy what I was looking for. My burger was way too sweet and the chili fries that everyone talks about are just meh...nothing too exciting. Probably won't be stopping by again unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting for this Bachi Burger to open where I would occasionally drive by to check. It opened while I was on vacation so this is the first place I ate after we got off the plane. I have been here two times so far and have been delighted each time!
The first time I came here I ordered the Lobster Roll which was tasty but if you don't like a strong curry taste then don't order it. The curry is strong in this dish. It came with root chips which were nice and crunchy. We also ordered the truffle fries which were delicious!  My husband had a cold so they suggested their green tea which really helped him. 
The second time we ate here I got the Kiki burger which had these yummy mushrooms! I love mushrooms especially if they are sauteed. They warned me ahead of time that the burger is not made well done. That was perfectly fine with me because I like my burgers juicy! It was amazing! I also tried one of their drinks that had jasmine in it.  The drink was good but if you don't like your mouth feeling flowery then you may not like it. I thought it was cool! 
I love that this place is so close to home!"}
{"text":"Service sucks ass.

Walked in around 5 pm, and there were about 2-3 tables already. We were seated by the girl behind the bar and was told our server would be with us (twice). Our server came out and greeted us, he seemed nice and friendly. He took our order and our food came out pretty quick. 

But the whole time we were there, they did not check on us, not even once.  We finished our food  and were sitting there for over ten minutes. The girl was always behind the bar using her phone or in the kitchen talking to the chefs. She came out to seat guests and walked by us a few times, didn't even check on us. The guy walked around to other tables to take orders but didn't acknowledge us. My boyfriend was getting mad so he just called him over and asked for the check. 

Food was decent, service was terrible."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles and was visiting some friends who live in Vegas.  They told us to try Bachi Burger since they compared it to Umami Burger in LA.  Of course, I had to try it to see what the difference was.  

Bachi Burger by far has the BEST burgers that I've had to date.  All of their burgers have an Asian fusion flair.  Their Ronin burger was truly amazing with the grilled onions and Bachi BBQ sauce.  Their Parmesan Truffle fries are also amazing with a special mushroom sauce that was drizzled on top. 

And to top that all off, we almost didn't order their dessert which was the malasadas and I am so glad we did because those were amazing! 

I also took a sip of their homemade sodas and their Mandarin Tangerine soda is so good.

If I could, I would've wanted to try all of their burgers.  We also ordered their BBQ Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer and those were freaking amazing as well!  

Please open one up in LA!  I would go there everyday if I could.  That was how good it was!"}
{"text":"I heard great things, but was a little disappointed. The flavors were a little strange for me. The oxtail chili cheese fries were pretty good, but the egg was a little weird for me. I liked my fruity milkshake, but I will not be going back. :("}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try...what a disappointment! The fries came way before our burgers and we were done eating them before our burgers came...I don't know if they consider fries an appetizer but I don't! 
I ordered the BBQ Bachi Burger and added avocado and bacon for $1.50 each...which was a waste of money. My avocado was not fresh and the bacon portion was so stingy I didn't even taste it in my burger. 
I'd rather eat at In & Out then spend my money here on tasteless burgers."}
{"text":"These are seriously some of the best burgers I have ever had.  I don't know how they do it but the meat is out of this world delicious and tender and the sauces are really good and usually ask for them on the side.  They even have turkey and salmon burgers. Would love to try them all."}
{"text":"I went  for lunch today and all I can say is \"I will be back\". I had the Oxtail Chilli Fries and it was marvelous. The portion was large and a great value. There are so many selections that I will need to study the menu in advance for my next trip. The wait staff was timely and friendly. Casual dress, reasonable cost and great food."}
{"text":"Watched it on Triple D and visited this place. Tried the Banh mi and Miyagi burger with salt and pepper garlic fries. Lives up to its Guy\"s reputation . The Banh mi burger has a class of its own. Unique flavor , soft bun , kicky burger patty with the pork pate and the picked veggies on the side makes this one hell of a choice. Miyagi was good too but nothing spectacular. Now to the Garlic jalapeño fries. Killer is the definition ! Wowow, this is something you don't find anywhere else . Crispy fried jalapeño , scallions and garlic with skat and Pepper makes this a must try at this place . Overall it's worth the visit and its claim to fame ."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger had always been a favorite of mine. Great atmosphere and customer service. Great beers to go with great burger. Best sweet potato fries is ever had!"}
{"text":"Bachi, you had me at Oxtail Chili fries.  With Egg.  WHAaaaT!?  

I read on the menu and find Wagyu Shortrib Baos, yum.  OMG, then come the burger choices.  The following jump out at me:
-  \"Banh Mi Burger\" (Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp and Pork Pate) 
-  the Kalbi burger (Angus beef, Kalbi Marinade and KimChee)
- \"Shogun\" (Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Foie Gras)

I feel like if I was telling you this review out loud, my voice would be an octave higher.  Even I am a little annoyed by my own high-pitched excitement (lol) and lack of more intelligent words but Its been a while (if ever) when I looked at a menu and I wanted to try 4-5 items equally - so this was how it felt to be happy and confused at the same time!

In the end I got the Kiki's burger (which was awesome) and I got to try a bite (or two or three) out of everyone's plate from our party of 4.  The duck, pork belly and shortrib baos were delish.  Damn, everything was good.

For you Vegas visitors, know that this is off the strip - but so well worth the trip!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I randomly read about this place on Yelp and since I was going to be in Vegas, I decided to try it out.  It's nice to eat off the Strip sometimes.  It is definitely oddly located, and we missed it at first.  It was pretty dead for lunch, so we didn't have to wait long to get our food.  So we asked about the beef, and it turns out that the beef comes from Kansas and some other corn states.  The waiter had to ask someone in the back, but he said that the cows are grass fed.  They ground all the meat in-house.

Prices are definitely on the pricier side considering the portions.  In fact, my friend had to order another burger to split w/ someone bc he was still hungry.  All the burgers had a similar taste - I think the patties were glazed with some sort of sweet sauce, but the toppings made a difference.  We tried three burgers, and all were good, though I liked the Bachi Burger the best.  

-Bachi Burger, Kalbi Burger, and Bahn Mi Burger - I'd recommend all of them, though the Kalbi Burger was nothing special.  The kim chee they use is not spicy at all and is made from regular cabbage.  
-Pork Belly Buns - Good but not filling at all.   You get two tiny buns.  Nice for a snack, maybe.
-Truffle Parmesan Fries - Shoestring crispy fries.  Yummy!!  We also asked for a side of the pineapple ketchup - they should really bottle that stuff.  
-Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee ($3.50) - This had an interesting taste bc the whipped cream was made w/ salt.  It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked but it was definitely different.

Another friend came later and ordered the turkey/chicken burger, but it never came.  Apparently the waiter forgot, so she ended up canceling it after waiting a long time.  The bill came to about $51, not including tip.  Our waiter, who reminded me of Jimmy Fallon but taller, was nice and did his best to answer all our questions.  I'd definitely come back my next trip to Vegas, though I wish the portions were bigger!!

PS:  The website says they are open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. but they had a sign on the door stating they close at 10 p.m. on Sundays.  Not sure which is true, but I'd go with the sign!"}
{"text":"We initially stopped by the other Bachi Burger location. I think it was the one on Windmill.  OMG the line was crazy for it.  It was also connected to a Ramen restaurant, so we weren't sure which one people were waiting for.  We headed to the Russell location, and this one was half empty!  Not sure why, but we were happy!  Turns out I came here before for bunch when it was known as Bachi Healthy Life.  I guess they converted it back to a Bachi Burger, though the interior looked the same.

Two friends were not impressed with their burgers - one found it way too sweet.  She had ordered the Bahn Mi Burger and didn't like all the sweet sauce (which is found on all their burgers, I think).  My other friend got some special burger with foie gras, which wasn't very good either.  I think her burger was $20-30!  Yikes.  A third friend go the Kimchi burger, which she enjoyed. I got the Ronin Burger, which I liked.  I like their burgers bc I do like sweet food, so if you're not a fan, you might want to skip this place.  Oh, order the onion rings - they are really good.  I'm not usually a fan of onion rings, but these were made with the lightest and crispiest batter (similar to a light tempura batter) - they were really good!  The Parmesan and Garlic fries were thing and crisp, too.  Their drinks were also good.  A friend got some non-alcoholic peach drink that was delicious!  Overall, I enjoyed the meal, though a few friends didn't.  To each her own, though."}
{"text":"The \"banh mi\" burger was soooo good I'm still dreaming about it in my sleep. I also had the oxtail chili cheese fries and let me just say \"Ahhh....lordy, yummm\".  Everything else I tried was good but those 2 were the best."}
{"text":"I HATE it when I eat something so good that I can't stop thinking about it. Every meal for weeks afterwards is just DISAPPOINTING. The oxtail cheese fries, Ronin burger, and salted caramel marshmallow milkshake make all of the other food I eat a 
LET DOWN.

SERIOUSLY, Thank you, Bachi Burger for RUINING Thanksgiving the next day. i guess i will have to eat at your fine establishment again. 





really, this may have been one of the best things I have ever eaten-that is all."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burger, anywhere....

- MISO BURGER (cant go wrong with any burger): So juicy, so flavorful, ratio meat/bun/extras is perfect. the bun is perfect, brioche i think, and doesnt get crazy soggy. Unlike another Asian Fusion burger spot (Umami) you get a good portion of food.
- OXTAIL FRIES: oxtail gravy meat over fries, lots of frieds, with an EGG on it
- TRUFFLE PARM FRIES: truffle me up

BOOM.

 
AMBIANCE: is like any other restaurant, nothing too crazy, clean and good for families.

SERVICE: friendly and attentive when i went a while back.

PRICES: worth every penny!

PARKING: lot :)"}
{"text":"Exciting choices, unbelievable flavors, winner winner pants on fire! Ronin burger and Spicy Miso burger bursting with juice and flavors. Total awesome cooking."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it wasn't as good as everybody hyped it up to be. Customer Service here is an A+. Our server was very attentive, friendly and knowlegable.

For appetizer,we had the fried calamari for $10. It came with this creamy tar tar sauce type and some lime sauce. It was ok. It wasn't crispy. It was more like they tried to fry it but not long enough because it was kind of soggy. 

For entrees, I chose to do the \"famous\" oxtail chili cheese fries for $11. First sight- presentation is beautiful. The fried egg was perfectly cooked to where you break it and the yolk just oozes. The taste-SALTY. The fries were crispy but that meat sauce was so salty and spicy because of the jalapeños. Was not impressed at all. 

My Bf got the Miyagi San burger with the Wagyu patty. First of all, you don't get a side with it so don't forget to order fries if you want a side. The burger patty itself was good but for $15 he wasn't even full. 

In the end our bill came up to $45. It's kind of disappointing because we had high expectations for the place. We ended up throwing away the leftover cheese fries because we couldn't even eat it anymore. We were better off getting In and Out or Shake Shack to be honest and we would've been alot happier."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place and let me explain why they deserve 5 stars!

Bachi Burger serves you the gourmet burger experience without the strip prices!

I can personally vouch for The Crusty Crab sandwich and the Ronin Burger. Both burgers are extremely filling by themselves and each have their own unique Asian flair.

You don't even have to be a fan of seafood or crab meat to enjoy what  The Crusty Crab has to offer. It's a great burger that doesn't have over powering flavor. Both the chutney and tartar sauce compliment the burger well.

The Ronin, where to begin... I love the fried egg and the angus beef is cooked to perfection. For $11 you get great quality ingredients and a filling portion size. The burger does have a sweet flavor however it's not overpowering.

Overall, this place is far from perfect and service is definitely not amazing and hit and miss at times... But for the value this place is great and I have yet to try a burger that I don't fall in love with!

Bachi Burger deserves 5 stars because they've got me hooked. Sure they're far from being perfect but they deliver on offering a quality burger and it's consistently pleasing. 

If you're a fan of trying new burgers especially with some asian flavored you'll keep coming back, guaranteed. 

The breakdown: (for what you pay)

Service: 3/5
Food quality: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Plating/presentation: 5/5"}
{"text":"Here are a couple interesting facts:
In Japanese, \"Bachi\" are those wooden sticks used to play the taiko drums.
In Polish, \"Bachi\" means grandmother...well it's actually Babcia but sounds like bachi.

Bottom line: If you like burgers, you'll have to try Bachi out.  Personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to try this burger joint again.  My reference point is Umami's Burger.

I'm a pictures person so check out my links to view the pictures I've uploaded of:
1. Oxtail Chili Cheese fries - This is their staple dish so give it a shot and try it for yourself.  Beware of the the jalapenos, they are a real kicker!  The shreded meat will give you a different texture so don't let your mind fool you into thinking \"this should taste like the regular ground beef chili cheese fries\" because it won't.  I wasn't that impressed.

2. Ronin Burger - Must try! The Caramelized onions and egg on this burger was awesome.  If you like the sweetness of caramelized onions, this is a must try.  Didn't really experience much of the japanese cole slaw inside the burger.  

3. Pork Belly Bao - The steamed bao bun was lukewarm at best, not the typical not hot and steamy bao, which was a disappointment.  It reminded me of defrosted bao bread microwaved and then left out at room temp, it simply did not taste fresh.  The Pork belly was a thick cut but if it's a thick cut of fat...no bueno.  I'd pass on this.  However, the sliced boiled egg was a pleasant surprise in the bao."}
{"text":"They were out of several of their popular specialty burgers plus they had no bacon, which severely limited our choices. 

2 burgers plus an order of fries took about 45 minutes to get out. They were busy but not packed by any means. 

Heard ex and current staff grumbling about the bad management. 

Our waiter was very nice, and that was about the only positive. The food we got was good but nothing amazing. 

I've heard great things about this place before, but that wasn't our experience. This rating is only for my one visit, I can't speak to the place overall."}
{"text":"I take my Mom here to the Windmill location for lunch. She's in a wheel chair and oxygen and our dinning experience always puts a smile on her face. From your wonderful burgers to ramen noodle soups and Bachi caesar salad, we love the entire experience. We've had to wait as long as 30 minutes at lunch time, and it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Burgers were def on point! Had the Miyagi-san & it was delicious! Service sucked though, unfortunately. The bus boy was hella cool but the waiter was AWOL most the night. The Thai was bomb! All in all, good place to eat but bad service! FYI, if you don't like your buns toasted, let them know, cuz they'll toast the hell out your buns! Lol"}
{"text":"Experience:  One of my friends loves this spot and I met up with them for a late lunch/early dinner. We went on a Sat at 4pm. 

Facility: there are many locations, but we went to the one in Summerlin. It's tucked back behind some businesses off the main road, but I eventually found it. It's got a nice modern feel with tables and chairs and some bench seating. They have some alcoholic drinks and even a few beers on tap. 

Service:  our waiter was super nice, even dare I say...fun.  He was very informative, but still playful, making the experience even better. Wish I would have remembered his name to give him all the credit. :(

Food:  ok, I was super lame and only ordered the plain Wagu burger with tomato, lettuce and mayo.  The patty of meat was marinated delicious!!!!!  It almost tastes like its marinated in teriyaki sauce. However, I ordered it med, but it was more med-well. The plain fries were good. Crispy and hot, small shoestring style. 
We did order the pickle appetizer, but I wasn't really a fan. My friend loved it though!

Overall:  I liked it. Not my fav burger in town, but not the worst. I will come back someday I'm sure, because I did enjoy the flavor of the burger patty and the service was good."}
{"text":"You MUST get the oxtail chili cheese fries! So good. And try the Apple Lychee Soda. Yummmm. Any burger you get is not just a burger but an experience. 

They're a bit understaffed but the food still came in a reasonable amount of time. 

If Joan is your server, ask for sides up front (lemon, salad dressing, ketchup) because you'll have to ask for it at least twice. He's sweet, just not on top of the extras. 

I'll definitely be back here and will recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Burgs! Nothing better than a good burg. Bochi produces a pretty notably good one too. I enjoyed the oxtail fries more though. Those things are nuts...it's sweet and spicy and meaty and cheesy. Everything you could ever need to make your taste buds dance! It's a huge portion too. We split it between 3 people and were stuffed before our burgs even came out. 

I don't recall the name of the burger I got but it was one of their popular ones with onion strings, fried egg, and ca realized bacon. Oh that bacon! So good. They cooked it medium rare perfectly, which I always appreciate. It was super juicy when I cut into it. In all honesty though, it didn't have a ton of flavor. I thought the spicy mayo would come through more. The bacon was the best part. And the bun was super good too. Really fluffy and slightly sweet. 

Definitely a place to try! Everything's got a bit of a Japanese twist so it's interesting."}
{"text":"Came in around midnight and waited about 10 minutes for a table. Service was great--attentive and enthusiastic. The food, however, did not live up to the hype. 

Truffle fries were nice and crunchy, but I wasn't a fan of the black truffle cream. The dipping sauce on the side, however, was bomb. I even smothered it on my burger.

Tried a bite of our friend's oxtail chili cheese fries, and while it was good, it still just taste like chili cheese fries--nothing special.

I ordered the Ronin burger, which was pretty good at first, but the over-medium egg added a strange dry texture to the burger. The accompanying sauce didn't do anything for the burger either, which is why I added the sauce from our fries. Overall, the burger was alright, but the meat is where my issue is. The whole patty was oddly shaped like a perfectly formed puck (smooth, even edges and everything), and while I ordered mine medium rare, I've NEVER had a burger cooked to that degree and NOT be able to fall apart when I stick my fork through the middle of it. I tried to get the meat to crumble by wiggling my fork back and forth, but it just wouldn't... which greatly alarms me. The meat was so packed together it wouldn't even disentangle itself even though it wasn't even cooked through. Strange..

I also ordered an iced green tea to go along with my meals and it was alright too. Sure, you get unlimited refills, but my second glass tasted really diluted to me. At $4, I'd just stick with the free water.

Boyfriend ordered the Miyagi-san and said his burger was good but wasn't that great either. He didn't seem too impressed with the wagyu patty. Our other friends ordered the same 2 burgers and our general consensus was that the burgers were alright but we've definitely had much, much better. 

For the price of our meals, we all felt that the quality and flavor wouldn't warrant a return visit. Glad we got to give it a try though, and that it was open late & happened to be on our way up to the strip."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is at the top of my list of restaurants to visit when I come to Vegas.. and I'm in Vegas on business at least every other month! It has also been a sure win every time I bring friends and family here, to the point that they've all caught the bug and now make this a regular pit stop of their own as well. This place makes the big chef name franchise burger restaurants on the strip, look like a cheap novelty in comparison. (Big words, I know, but that's my sincere opinion.)

Customer service is consistently friendly and accommodating, but it seems they are on and off with under staffing, which leads to long waits if you are a needy customer. (Guilty, sorry in advance!)

I've only ever had to wait for a table less than a handful of times, and never more than 5-10 minutes even during their peak hours.

The ambience is lovely, in a clean environment and great location!

The food is extraordinarily PERFECT every time!
-My go-to is the KiKi's Medium Wagyu Burger, add egg! Yummmm, Shitake AND Enoki Mushrooms, Crispy Bacon, Onion Marmalade, with a perfect juicy  burger and delicious Garlic Aoili sauce to match!
-You really can't go wrong here.. Miyagi-San, Spicy Miso, Kalbi, Ronin, Shogun, Pork Belly Bao. It's seriously an All-Star menu! Each burger has something different to offer your lucky taste buds.
-Ox Tail Fries, a self-explanatory MUST TRY!
-Sweet Potato Fries are some of my favorite I've had anywhere. They're perfectly balanced with sweet and salty crunchiness, paired with my favorite Yuzu Sauce!
-Their Crab Cakes are perfection!
-During one of my visits, they were offering a mind-blowing special.. Baked Bone Marrow Jelly with Duck Butter. Holy umami!
-I've had a handful of other unique appetizer specials from this place, and I can't remember them all. However, I do distinctly remember that each and every one of them has blown my socks off!
-Last but not least... I'm always way too full to even look at the dessert menu by the end of the meal, but I can't believe I've been missing out this whole time. I've only recently had the chance to try the MATCHA TIRAMISU, and wow, just wow. It's different and delicious.  Basically, like everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Tried the Oxtail chili cheese fries! Heavenly good but very rich in calories.
The Miyagi-San burger is about the same. I felt like after dinner my arteries were clog. Lol
Seriously, bugler and oxtail fries were delicious! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after my friends that I was with in Vegas wanted to go after seeing it on Diners Drive ins and Dives.

The funny thing was only one of us actually ordered a burger, but the ox tail chili fries, which were featured was really good.  Definitely a must.  I got the spicy chicken with some rice and onion rings.  The onion rings were amazing.  I could have easily have eaten another order, by myself.  Also a must.  The chicken was good as well.  It hit the spot for me that day.  My friends each ordered the buns, one with duck one with pork belly.   The burger looked good and my friend said that it was pretty good.  I also got a milk tea with boba.

They seemed to have merged with the Ramen place next door (which is how i was able to get some rice with my chicken) so there were items on the menu that were not something you would expect at a burger place.

We were there on a Friday at lunch time and we did wait for a bit.  There were quite a few people waiting in front of us for a weekday.  Once we were seated, service was great."}
{"text":"Yucky!! There's very unique combinations of foods here. Which is great but there should still be an option for plainer simple burgers and fries too. Not my kind of burger joint. It was packed and people loved it."}
{"text":"Exellent, very creative burgers. Food is unique and tasty. I had the fish burger and oxtail chili cheese fries it was good! Service was also good. I can't wait to come back and try something different :)"}
{"text":"Truffle parmesan fries were so good I almost ate the paper wrapper that it was held in. As for the burger I had I wasn't impressed.  The prices were thankfully decent."}
{"text":"Alright, I will say the food was very good. However, the problem I had was with the drinks and the price.  I ordered a 5.00-7.00 bottle of beer.  The server recommended the \"special\" which was a glass (about 16 oz) of Japanese draft beer.  I took it. Well, I got the bill, and it was $10.50 for that glass of draft beer. The server failed to tell me it was 10.50 and I would NEVER in a million years think that a draft beer was going to cost me more then the burger.  I think the server should have communicated that the \"special\" was as pricey as it was.  Its things like this that will keep me from going back, as I feel I was mislead by the word \"special.\"  Also, my friend was eating from a second plate and they came up to the table about 3 times while she had food on the plate asking if they could take it away.  Slightly annoying being interrupted several times when food was on the plate and not pushed away."}
{"text":"I love the food here but I'm giving the two stars only because the rudeness of the staff when I came to pick up my food. I placed an order for pick up I talked to Steve and when I arrived the hostess came up and asked how she could help.  I told her I called in an order and talked to Steve.  I gave her my name and instead of talking to Steve she started walking around looking confused.   

I was standing at the bar and another server, a red head definitely looked overworked asked if I was being helped.  I said yes, I placed an order to go and the hostess was helping me.  In a very rude tone she said have a seat and we will find it.  

After watching the hostess walk past the bag with my food in it sitting on the counter and talking to two other people neither one Steve, she finally brought the bag over.  I was so pissed with the attitude and how I was treated i gave her my money, took my food and left.  I won't be back any time soon, they are just too rude for me to spend my money there....there was no reason or justification for the server to talk to a customer like that.  She never looked at me and never did anything to help find the food but had no issue being rude.."}
{"text":"Did the burgers live up to the hype? Yes - very well presented and cooked perfectly. Roughly a 30+ minute wait on weekend lunchtime. Drinks, however, were made from powder, and tasted like it too. My boba were also tasteless, unlike the lightly sweet honeyed flavor I'm used to in LA. $4.50 down the drain.

4.5* for the burgers
1.5* for the drinks

Come for the burgers, skip the milk teas!"}
{"text":"A more accurate rating would be 3.5 stars. I have mixed feelings about this joint. On one hand, I like that it's locally owned, away from the strip, and it's a fusion of an American classic with an Asian twist. But it's faulty service made me lower it's rating. 

The food was great. My banh-mi burger was recommended by the server and it didn't disappoint. The burger was delicious with amazing flavor of mint and lemongrass. It came with a great dipping sauce that smelled like fish sauce. Other people in my group got the crusty crab, lonely bird, grilled fish sandwiches and they all enjoyed it. Our sides of sweet potatoe, truffle parmesean, and plain fries was a great complement to our sandwiches. It came in this pseudo-cool funnel container that's supposed to mask how little you get. Nonetheless, the fries were good but a bit thin. For dessert we got the Portuguese Donuts with coffee gelato, and their berry poptart. It tasted fresh and not overtly sweet. 

What prevented this place from getting a higher rating was the service and weird entrances. There are two entrances. One with a couch and tv with a lounge vibe. The second was cramped and messy with chairs and newspapers. We were at the latter. I think this is totally detrimental to the quality of service. At the time, there was one guy working the front and he had to juggle both sides. He looked flustered while holding his clipboard. The wait time for food was unnecessarily long. Look, I like my food cook to order, but damn, if I'm going to be waiting this long, I better be shitting platinum, gold, and diamonds. I will say the servers were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the food. The place is new, so I'm giving it another chance. And I'm intrigued about their other items. Especially their steamed sandwiches. I would recommend it but hopefully you don't have to wait 20-30 minutes for a burger."}
{"text":"Two years ago I dined at the original location and left with slight disappointment. I loved the food and servers, but was miffed by the long wait for the food. After refraining from going since then, I made an effort to visit their new location to see if things changed, and I'm glad to report things have improved for the better.

The new location is larger and the aesthetic darker, sleek, and comfortable. Service throughout the entire meal was attentive and kind. Drinks were filled without being asked. One of the waitresses sweetly made conversation and our main server checked in good intervals. The apex of the night was the food.

The meal was delightful and fulfilling. The steamed edamame was a nice beginning; the portions were generous, hot, and lightly salted. The parmesean truffle fries were heavenly. The fries were served in a shiny funnel container and tasted hot, crispy, and cheesy. I enjoyed the tomato aioli sauce that was paired with it, too. However, I wish the fries were thicker. As you work your way to the bottom of the funnel, they begin to shrivel into little pieces that start to resemble crumbled potato chips. I ordered the no-meat burger and requested avocado. The presentation was simple and cute. The burger itself was tall and I had trouble biting into it. The flavor of the mushroom patty was a notch better than store bought veggie patties. What really elevated the burger was the toppings and airy bun. The sweet tofu, mixed greens and salty patty created a pleasing experience for my taste buds. Although, next time I would say no on the vinaigrette that comes with it because it became a little to greasy for me. Overall, Bachi retained it's good food with improved service. Hopefully it stays that way."}
{"text":"I had the miyagi-san burger and it was to die for! Not only was it bursting with flavor, it was cooked fantastically.  I'm usually disappointed with medium-well burgers, but this one is going on my top 5. My roommates and I woke up talking about when we are going again. Our new burger place!"}
{"text":"I had been raving about this place to my hubby for the past month and finally got him here earlier this week. I did have to take them down from a 5/5 to a 4/5 due to a repeat burger being less impressive and so-so service.

Last time I came my party ordered the oxtail chili fries, but it was too spicy for my tastes. So this time we went with the truffle fries. They were awesome fries, but I can't say they screamed truffle. Next time I would either get those sweet potato fries again or try the salt and pepper fries. 

Hubby and I both ordered one of burger specials - he got the lamb burger I'd absolutely raved about and I tried a burger that's served on a bed of risotto. Unfortunately, that lamb burger just didn't hit the second time. My hubby flat out hated it. I thought that was strange because of how much I enjoyed it on my first visit. I took a bite - while it wasn't as awful as he led me to believe, I had to agree that it just wasn't doing it for me. The red sauce on top is pretty darn sweet - overly sweet, which is not his thing. I usually enjoy sweet on my burger, but I like for something like a sharp cheese to help balance it. When we finally managed to wave down our waiter, we expressed our disappointment and asked if we could swap out our burger (which only had two small bites taken out of the huge patty) for another (more expensive) burger. But our waiter informed us that wasn't an option - all he could do was charge us for a new burger. Hmmm....

Thank goodness the burger I ordered was not only awesome, but huge enough to share. As I mentioned before, this burger sat on top of a bed of risotto. It was then topped with fried onions, siracha bacon jam and two fried eggs. The risotto was cooked perfectly and had a simple parmesan flavor. The fried onion rings were skinny cut and crunchy - just the way I like them. And the bacon jam was chunky and delicious!

I definitely want to go back to this place and try to confirm the 5/5 rating that I originally gave it."}
{"text":"Ate here a week ago with friends. 

I got the house made pickles, salt n pepper fries, and veggie burger. 

The pickles were heavenly. I would go back for them alone...so yummy. There was a variety and they're house made. Only complaint was I wanted MORE. 

The fries were hot and crispy. I didn't taste much pepper or salt so that was my only complaint. Still yummy though. 

The burger was ginormous and delicious. I cut it in half which I'm not sure was a good idea...it just made a bigger mess. Overall it was so delicious. The burger patty was very \"meaty\" tasting and had a nice crispy outside. The veggies and bun were fresh and everything tasted great. Def the kinda burger you can't put down...messy and lots of napkins needed. 

The service wasn't great but nothing bad either....just neutral. The restaurant was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger sells gourmet Asian inspired burgers at a premium price. The burgers are good, but can get pretty pricey.

My favorite thing was the truffle fries. The burgers were good too but just pricey. I ordered the Kiki burger, which had sautéed mushrooms, angus beef,  caramelized bacon, sweet onion, and garlic chili aioli."}
{"text":"All the way from New York where's there's so many burger joints , I have to say the burger I tried was amazing .. Wow !! By the way I had the shogun burger .
Really nice atmosphere and management . Is a must when you in Vegas .."}
{"text":"When you walk in you know the place is crowded for a good reason . This is a place where people with distinctive taste go for a burger.  The word \"burger\" is an understatement for their burgers. Love this place and will return with friends."}
{"text":"Always great food. They have such a great selection if burgers that are all amazing. The Wagyu beef is phenomenal. 

You should try the truffle Parmesan fries. 

Also, try the milkshakes. They are wonderful either with your meal or as a dessert. 

Overall, you should try this restaurant. It is a very good experience. 
Sometimes the service is slow, but overall the experience is always great."}
{"text":"Best chili fries I ever ate. Oxtail fries. Ate the Ronin Burger. Cooked well. A tad on the sweet side. Needed a little more brightness to contrast with the grease and heaviness. Would go again."}
{"text":"Okay.  Final thoughts on bachi burger: 


My hopes were so high.  

If you completely deconstruct the burger I ate, everything was amazing.  
The bun fantastic.  Meat.  Fantastic.  Slaw. Fantastic ... you get the point. 
All together it looked like an infant had the shits and it was just gross.     

The fries were soggy and nothing was on them. I got all the fixings on the side which just throws the balance off.    Listen, I'm a total dipper - so that's saying something.  However the porcini (spell check) sauce was AMAZING.

I'll try it again - but only as a dine in. I get it.  Some things don't deliver well.  Please let this be one of them."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas, Love it. as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is very good but by the time you get it you will be so pissed off you won't be able to enjoy it. Now I'm a complainer, I'll be the first to admit, but I'm also a complimenter (which is why most of my reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star). That being said, I cut Bachi Burger quite a bit of slack on my visit because I know they might not have the experience in the business yet to know how important something like, I don't know, having glasses that AREN'T chipped is (also I took a Xanax so that might have helped their case).

Our server was pleasant, but like others, she disappeared after our order was taken. We all ordered a specialty drink and when I got mine I noticed the bottom was extremely chipped. I flagged down a second waitress (Jordan) and asked for a glass that wasn't chipped (you know, so I don't ACCIDENTALLY DRINK GLASS AND DIE) and she went to the counter, pulled one glass out, saw it was also chipped and came back with it to my table. \"Well, all the glasses are chipped,\" she said, \"Is yours sitting on the table weird or something?\" Nope, it sat on the table just fine, I just didn't want to have to sue her place of employment when I cut the crap out of myself.  Whatever, I let it go and drank out of the chipped glass as I watched her walk to a table in the corner, sit and take her break for ten minutes. I drank out of the chipped glass as I watched a very tall gentleman, whose only job I observed in the 90 minutes we were there seemed to be macking on the waitresses, come over and chat her up. Fine, everyone is allowed a break, just maybe, you know, NOT in the dining room where everyone can see you including the 10 people waiting in the lobby to be seated. The rest of our meal went pretty much like many of the other reviews listed: food brought out in a seemingly arbitrary order, drinks going unfilled for 10 minutes or longer (at one point I actually went to the counter, took the pitcher and filled my drink myself), burgers that were requested medium rare coming out medium, etc. I had to go up to the counter again to order flag someone down to take my desert order and Jordan, the \"Is it sitting on the table weird\", came over to take it. Then ten minutes later our actual server came over again to take our desert order. It was just very chaotic and frustrating. 

 Obviously the management at Bachi Burger KNOWS of these issues. They clearly read the yelp page and I'm clearly not the first person to complain, but they've done NOTHING to fix it. Maybe they just don't know how or just don't care because enough of us come back anyway, even with the poor service.  I would really like to see this restaurant shaped up Gorden Ramsey style. Whoever the tall gentleman I mentioned previously was I didn't see him do anything the entire evening. Strike that, he leaned on things and flirted VERY well, but unfortunately that didn't help us get our food. Everyone else, even the manager/owner, was running food so I don't know if they are just short staffed or poorly managed or inexperienced or all three. I give them two chipped stars."}
{"text":"Just as I expected ! Delicious! We started off with the oxtail cheese fries and they were really good. I had the bahn mi burger and my boyfriend had the spicy ramen. Can't wait to go back try different things"}
{"text":"Sigh. So this definitely wasn't the best dinner experience I've had. Jacob and I decided to have dinner with friends from school. We are all hospitality majors and a few of us had heard of this place and wanted to check it out (specifically me). 

We arrived a few minutes after Jake, and Sam with his wife and son RJ. It was a little stuffy, but we assumed that was because of the multitude of people in the restaurant. It was extremely easy to find parking close to the restaurant. 

Our server quickly introduced herself, and was super friendly, but might have miscounted, as we didn't have the right number of menus for all of us. I had been dying to try the Bahn Mi burger for days, so that's what I ordered, only to find out that they were or of that specific \"patty\" so they weren't able to make the burger. She did state that it is a very popular burger, so I asked for recommendation... which were not what I was expecting. Like her recommending the burger they have with fish... she also stated they were out of red sangria, but managed to get me one last glass. So I will thank her for that. 

I decided to order the same burger as my boyfriend and Sam, which contains a multitude of mushrooms, arugula, gruyere cheese and caramelized onions. 

At this point. Let me summarize what happened. We ordered a plate of pickled items, and calamari. Sadly, Jacob and I weren't too impressed with the pickled items. But 1 year old RJ was, so they didn't go to waste. The calamari was a table favorite. 

We were never offered refills of water or any of our other beverages, and had to wave down the bus girl who Jacob and Sam said reeked of weed and apparently likes to reallllly focus on filling only one glass per table visit. We also had empty appetizer plates for almost 20 minutes after finishing. 

All of our food came at the same time. Except baby Rj's who's food came a few minutes after ours. I really wish they would have brought his food at first, because I hate when a kid gets his food after the adults. 

The caramelized onions in the burger were superb and they cook the burgers perfectly, but the sweet buns and onions overpowered EVERYTHING else in the burger, and the Parmesan porcini truffle fries only tastes of Parmesan, lacking in salt and truffle. 

I would have told our server all of this if she had checked up on us after taking our order, but we only saw her at the end of the meal when we asked for our check. The checks were also split incorrectly, but because of how hot it was inside and because we were all really thirsty, we decided to pay for it and leave. 

This was not what I was expecting from this establishment. The food itself was 3 stars, but the service brought it down to 2. Sorry Bachi Burgers."}
{"text":"The food is consistently fantastic. Love the Miyagi burger and the salted Carmel shake is AMAZING. Only negative is that the service is kind of hit or miss.  However, they have great take out service so problem solved"}
{"text":"If I were a cow and were to be slaughtered, I wish my delicious body would be brought here, for I know I would be taken care of with the utmost delicacy and cooked to perfection.

The way I discovered Bachi Burger was by my friends bringing me back a fifth of a burger while I was in vegas.  I was already full from eating at a buffet so I didn't go with them but when I tried their left overs, I took a mental note that I had to go back one day.

Fast forward 3 months later, I came here with Ellie, my brother, and his girlfriend and I was amazed at the taste of the burgers.  We went for a late lunch, around 4pm and we were seated immediately.

I must admit, the environment of the place was a little too dim for my taste and there was quite a bit of a smokey atmosphere but I'll try not to sweat the small stuff.  

Our group ORDERED OXTAIL FRIES, a SHOGUN BURGER, and BBQ BACON BURGER.  

The taste was extraordinary to say the least.  I really enjoyed the oxtail fries which was about $12. The entire group split it and my only wish was that there was more meat.

My lady ordered the shogun burger which was a hefty $25 but it included what I believe was unagi.  She split half of her burger with another but she said it was well worth it.

As for me, my BBQ BACON burger was exquisite.  I loved the bread and the meat was cooked perfectly.  It was tender, juicy, delicious and well put together.  I wish I knew what kind of bread they used because it was perhaps the best burger bread I've ever had.  It reminds me of the bread from in n out which never crumbles while you eat it and it had a somewhat shiny, buttery texture. My burger COST about $15.  I'm not usually one to eat gourmet type burgers but this was well worth it.

For DESSERT, I ordered a strawberry tart with vanilla ice cream.  It was a solid dish but it didn't \"wow\" me like the burger did.  Next time I'll pass on it but all in all, I had a great experience.  This has my award for best burger (so far.)

You gotta go here!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this location because the original one had a broken air conditioner and said they couldn't accommodate our large party.

We came here and waited a ridiculously long time considering the restaurant wasn't even at  full capacity.   They were definitely short staffed and adding in the 115 degree heat outside, our party was not in the best of moods.

Anyhow, when we were seated, we ordered the oxtail fries, the kiki burger, the ronin burger, and a strawberry guava smoothie.

The quality of the food was exceptional just like the other location.  The bread of the burger is buttery and soft.  The meat is tender and juicy...the best I've had in my opinion, and the oxtail fries were delicious.  For the price ~$11, it was a fair deal.

Its definitely a must go if you've never had a gourmet burger.  It will for sure be one of the best hamburgers you've ever had.

The only reason I gave a 4 star was because the service was disappointingly slow and the waiters were a bit sweaty while they ran around.  I didn't want to see that right before I ate my food.  To be fair, it was a hell on earth because of the temperature but I think the business should hire more staff, especially on friday  nights during peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"Good unique burgers and other dishes....but not as great as I thought it would be.
The chili cheese fries were just so so...
."}
{"text":"I considered one star here, but the service from the waiters was alright for how busy they were, so they deserve that.
As for the food, I really do not understand the hype surrounding Asian flavors in hamburgers. From all these reviews here, you would think it is a match made in heaven, but honestly, it is exactly what it sounds like: an Asian flavored hamburger. If that's what you like, then you'll love this place. I actually am pretty happy with regular hamburgers and regular Asian food.
The price: The burgers cost way more than they really need to cost. You get one burger, nothing else.
I also have to agree with a lot of other reviewers here about how their hostess treats you. She was NOT nice. Basically could have been a robot taking names. 

I have no idea how this place really is so famous. Must be all those people that follow the triple D to all his food locales."}
{"text":"This place was freakin' awesome. Once again yelp did not let me down.  This place is actually just down the street to the resort we normally stay at, and it is now a must stop for when we come back to Vegas. 
We arrived for lunch and was seated promptly. We ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries and organic edamame for our appetizers. The oxtail chilli cheese fries were crazy good. It had the perfect amount of spiciness and toppings. The wife kept raving about how good the edamame was. If you like garlic then definitely give these a try.
They have a very different take on burgers, and from what we tried you can't  go wrong with your selection.  I went with the Miyagi-San burger and it was one of the tastiest I've ever had.  Wagyu beef cooked to perfection. My brother tried Mr Ho's burger and he said it was good.  Tried a bite and he was indeed telling the truth. Wife had the kale salad and she loved every bite of it. 
Our server was great.  Actually every worker we came across was great.  So yeah,  the service and staff was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, and our waitress was attentive to our needs. 
I definitely recommend this spot, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Must have when we are in vegas. The burgers are amazing, the choice is great, and the service is good.  

Try the oxtail fries.  They are genius.  

The Japanese selection is surprisingly good as well."}
{"text":"Very tasty we all had different burgers. The parm truffle fries did not last long. Burgers consumed were miyagi san, bahn mi, m ronin and basic bacon cheese burger. Full stomachs and a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome first time experience at Bachi burger. I saw this place on the Food Network and had been dying to try it ever since. 

The food was delicious. We ordered the signature oxtail chili fries and I was even able to convince my in-laws to try them! They enjoyed it! 

Ordered the bahn mi burger which was full of flavor. It came with a citrus vinaigrette for dipping. The vegetables were fresh and the bun was perfect: not too soft, but substantial enough to support the large burger. 

A great burger place with lots of options for those who may be shy to try something outside of their comfort zone."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential.  I agree with Keith - odd location with entrance at the back of the place away from the street.

Ambiance is nice, simple, but too dark even with natural light.  My pics that I will post are dark.

Obviously being open a week, they have some kinks to work out.  This probably would have been a three-star deal if they had \"been around\" awhile.

I ordered iced matcha tea (unlimited, but still $3) and it was very grassy and delicious, like the one at Yokohama Kaigenro.  Refilled a lot.  I contemplated those steamed bun sandwiches but wanted to try a burger since it is in the name.  I got the Ronin (miso-sesame glazed burger, Japanese slaw, fried egg, caramelized onion, katsu bbq), a side of shishito peppers, and sweet potato fries with kaffir lime salt and yuzu aioli.  Boyfriend got the kiki's burger: sauteed mushrooms, onion marmalade, gruyere, caramelized bacon, garlic chili aioli.  He also got bubble tea strawberry-mango shake.

We got the fries first - crisp, sweet, hardly any kaffir lime flavor, but love the yuzu aioli.  Here is where we experienced a moment of weakness.  We get our burgers and mine has bacon - his doesn't.  I had made it very clear to the waitress that I don't eat pork when I asked for her suggestions.  So my burger had to be remade, and Eric asked for a side of bacon since his didn't have it and it was supposed to.  He was done with his before I got mine.  The owner (brother of the chef) came out and apologized, and that's fine - first week stuff getting worked out (the register put I ordered bacon when I ordered peppers (P/B mix up) and they just forgot his entirely).

My burger ended up being intensely juicy and flavorful, and the egg yolk perfectly runny, and the peppers were grilled with no annoying oil or salt all over them.  Our waitress seemed antsy and was constantly trying to take away plates and drinks while we were still eating and drinking, so it got annoying.  We also had to ask for napkins and silverware once we got food.

They were kind enough to give me a to go cup of matcha iced tea.  (I am used to this royal treatment at Blue Fin).  We split the bill but they do not duplicate credit card receipts - they just do merchant copies only, so we had to ask for duplicate copies of the main bill. 

I will wait a while to go back so they can get their rhythm, but then I will try a duck or short rib steamed bun sandwich for sure!!

UPDATE: YUZU-CHERRY soda!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. The Organic Edamame Soybeans Stir Fried with Garlic/Ginger/Chili were AMAZING. So were the Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries with Garlic Chili Aioli. I got some with my burger and it was enough to share between 3 people. They have some really good beers here on the menu but the one the waitress suggested they were out of, and the next one she suggested they only had 1 left of. Also we tried to use the Yelp check-in offer which is buy 1 beer get 1 free and apparently you can only use it late at night. They did finally let us use it however since we mentioned it to the waitress when we ordered and she didn't say we couldn't use it until the bill came. I got The Crusty Crab and was so excited about it because it was supposed to come with avocado but there wasn't any on it. Same with my friend's. My other friend had The Banh-Mi Burger and she loved it. We were celebrating my birthday and they gave us free Portuguese Doughnuts with Coffee Gelato. I can't wait to go back and try the Kalbi Burger and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. One thing to mention is the Windmill location isn't that big and we had a long wait on a weeknight."}
{"text":"AMAZING get the kiki or miso burger yum! And they have my favorite beer!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is pretty consistent. We've been here a few times and can't complain. Their burgers are asian-esque and honestly, if you throw a fried egg in any burger, sandwich, pita pocket, what have you... odds are, I'm going to love it. 

The burgers are delicious. The shoe string fries are delicious. The lychee green tea (i think?) is refreshing. But the oxtail chili cheese fries are where its AT! They give you a a very generous amount and it can easily feed 3-4 people or just a really hungry (and selfish) ME. (but I guess I'll share)

Funny, because after I ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, I saw them on an episode of Triple D. I got to watch how they make the cheese fries and was surprised that they add semi sweet (or was it dark) chocolate chips! So deliciously weird and you'd never know but I bet it makes one hell of a difference!

The service is quaint. Polite. Quiet. Accommodating. Nothing mind blowing, but when you put an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries in front of us, nothing can really ruin the mood."}
{"text":"the best burger everrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!! We tried some of the burgers like kalbi burger, ronin burger, spicy miso burger and parmesan truffle fries and they were all excellent. i loved kalbi burger and parmesan truffle fries the best . and the service was good."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here currently having flashback/ withdrawals from that trippy acid burger! Wtf... I came out of review retirement just to praise this place of holy cow happiness. If they build one of these bad boys in L.A watch out Umami, F.O, or insert your  favorite burger joint here_________! The Shogun is Shonuff the baddest cow around and you should definitely  kiss it's Converse... Leeeeeeerooooy!"}
{"text":"I went today for lunch, disappointed.  I got the lonely bird again, it wasn't as good as the first time.  They lack consistency.  My friend got the miso burgo and really liked it.  The apple lychee soda, I'm not really a fan, it was kinda off, like not that refreshing or needed more carbonation.  The service today was horrible.  From the time we walked in to the time we got our food was over 40 mins, we didn't even have to wait for a table.  I'd go back, maybe for a different burger.  I would avoid lunch time, either go before or after the rush.  The service was that slow..."}
{"text":"During my recent trip to Vegas, I stopped by Bachi Burger with Ken L. due to rave reviews from fellow Yelper and friend Anh T. You were right, this place did not disappoint. It was nice to go off the strip and explore some of the other great food places Vegas has to offer. There are two locations for Bachi Burger, one on Windmill Lane and one on Sahara Ave. We came on a Monday for lunch. Good thing we got there early before the lunch crowd packed the place.

I'm a big fan of burgers and loved the idea of an Asian fusion burger. I ordered the miso burger and split the truffle parmesan fries. Ken L. ordered the Mr. Ho burger and a glass of their Plantation Sweet Tea. 

The truffle parmesan fries were really tasty and addicting. The plantation sweet tea was refreshing, had a hint of mint flavor, and was not too sweet.I really enjoyed the flavors of my miso burger. The burger was juicy, the buns were nicely grilled, and the veggies in the burger were fresh. I also enjoyed the taro bun on the Mr. Ho burger. 

I would say the star of the burgers is actually the Taiwanese style buns. They are freshly made made locally in a Chinatown bakery and to the restaurants specifications. They are slightly sweet but super light. 

Note: I hear they are going to open up a location in Southern California."}
{"text":"The wait time sucked! 25 minute wait for my burger, but it was worth it. I ordered the Mr. Ho's specifically for the taro bun, and it did not disappoint. The burger itself had bits of lop cheong (Chinese sausage) in it, the veggies were fresh and the sauces were magical. I'll be returning to try something else, hopefully they will pick up the pace"}
{"text":"First time here.  I tried the Ronin burger with bacon and cheddar cheese...OMG absolutely delicious. This place is a must go if you're in town."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite burger in the city. Very cool, modern place with unbelievably unique burgers. I would have never thought to fuse Asian cuisine with hamburgers but man does it work."}
{"text":"Went here on a sunday afternoon and the wait was about 45 minutes at around lunch time. I'm a out of towner so I decided to wait and see what was all this hype about.

I'm glad we waited though, food took a bit longer than expected but it was crowded.
The wait was worth it though. The burgers were cooked perfectly to what I ordered. 

Fries were a good serving to share, and lemonade was pretty sweet, really sweet for my tastebuds. Watered down it was perfect!

You'll spend 10-15 bucks a person if they order drinks and a burger and share fries.

can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"This place's food is amazing. Gourmet burgers and ramen... It's interesting that there's 2 separate kitchens, which I think sometimes have a hard time communicating. Anyways, we got the oxtail chili cheese fries, the truffle parm fries, the calamari, and all different types of ramen (6 of us eating). The fries were great! Lots of flavor in the chili, and a great dipping sauce for the truffle fries. The calamari was delicious!!! Came with 2 dipping sauces, 1 of which was a super interesting basil sauce (YUMMY). I always get the tan-tan ramen, which is a red seafood pork broth, very tasty and always recommended!! 
The downside to this place is the service. The waiters and waitresses are usually always nice, but not the best quality. We always have to ask for refills on the water, generally have to wait a long time to be greeted after being seated, and always have to get up to make our payments because they take forever to come to the table. 
Also, it's a little pricey. Plan to drop $15-20 per person. The iced tea was $4 each with no refills, oxtail fries $11, and ramen $9-$11 each bowl. 
I like this place but pass a lot because of the prices and the service."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 of my buddies after attending marquee day club. I actually had high expectations of the food at this place. I have to say, the service was excellent and the oxtail fries were delicious. When it came time to order my burger, i wanted the Ronin burger but wanted fois gras on it. The server quickly explained that i can have fois gras put on any burger which made me  happy. Other than this place the only fusion food ive had has been kogi truck, and i think both are top notch. Great place to eat with friends.

I suggest getting an order of the oxtail fries"}
{"text":"My first experience at Bachi was no fluke.  I came back for another Bachi-style lunch on my most recent trip to Vegas, and every expectation was exceeded -- all thanks to a friend named Miyagi-San.

Who exactly is Miyagi-San, you ask?

Only the BEST DAMN BURGER IN THE UNIVERSE.

A perfectly cooked, grass-fed Wagyu beef patty.  Fried egg.  Caramelized bacon.  Onion rings.  Chili mayo.  These glorious ingredients are what you can find on the Miyagi-San burger.  They come arranged in a vertical tower of architectural splendor.

The Miyagi-San burger pairs perfectly with a plate of Bachi pickles.  The umami of the burger plays in perfect harmony with the sour tang of the vegetables.  Every bite is heaven.

Meals like this are the stuff gastronomic dreams are made of.  If burger-induced ecstasy happens to be on your bucket list, a visit to Bachi is a must."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location yet and expected the same service as the one on Sahara. I was shocked to see how dead it was when we arrived, there was only two people there for 5pm on Friday. But at least we were seated promptly!

Our order was taken quickly but when we needed something while we waited for our food our waiter was nowhere to be found and when he did come out from the bar or kitchen he paid more attention to the only other table! Once our food was served it was as great as the Sahara location, that's why I'm giving this review three stars. 

As we ate our food it started picking up and more people started to arrive. But we noticed our waiter just disappear again as more people started piling up at the entrance. 

Once we finished our food it took about 10 minutes to have our plates cleared and another 25 to ask for a to go box! AND THEN another 15 to get our check! We didn't even ask our waiter but we had to ask someone else! What I don't understand is our waiter had our check ready the whole time and never brought it to the table. WTF. I'm so dissatisfied with the service it was appalling! I'm probably never going back because of this. I'll stick to the Sahara location."}
{"text":"I been here twice just recently and I totally forgot to write on yelp. But I found my favorite burger at Bachi. Its the Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. I can't order anything else. Its yummy, huge and filling. If you like egg on your burger this is the one for you.

I like regular fries with this burger but if I were to order a Kiki or a Ronin the truffle fries are the way to go.

You can't compare Bachi, Five guys. They serve different styles of burgers. But I love both."}
{"text":"I was recommended to Bachi Burger by about 3 different people and I was lucky enough to stop by! I'm not really a ramen fan but it looked so good that I needed to try. IT WAS AMAZING! Their garlic fries are out of this world and definitely a must try. I can't want to come back to Vegas have a round two!!"}
{"text":"The most delicious burger I will ever have in my life!!!! I've only tried the Miyagi Burger and I don't have the guts to steer away and try anything else because it is my absolute favorite! So juicy and mouthwatering, I can't wait to go back again! 

I would also suggest the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries! Soooo good!!! You will definitely not be disappointed! 

Overall, awesome food and clean setting with friendly staff! See you soon Bachi!"}

The burgers are soooo good!
The truffle fries are amazing!
And the ramen is good also!

It was fabulous-best burger I've ever had. It was pricey at $26, but the ingredients were one of a kind.Pair this with the oxtail chili cheese fries and you are set! Foodies should give this place a try. It isn't near the strip, but definitely worth the drive. I went on the way to the airport."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I went here with a couple of friends and my boyfriend for his birthday. It was my first time ever eating here and with all the praise that I've heard from this place, I had high expectations. 

It was Saturday lunch time and it was expected to be busy. It was a 40 minute wait but it wasn't too bad--I just wish that they would have additional seating other than the 8 they had inside the restaurant. However, this doesn't affect my review; more seats would have been nice.

We were seated in and everything was so loud and fast-paced. Our server wasn't very good at listening to our orders however, but it was probably due to the loud noises (even though we practically yelled our orders). The server was also a bit irritating because when one of us wanted to get the burger cooked well-done, she asked if we wanted all the orders to come together since preparing a burger well-done would take a while and we said it was fine but she insisted on bringing the orders out as soon as they're done. We had to reassure her like 3 times that we wanted them out at the same time. 

I ordered the Ronin and it was very delicious, however I tried the Miyagi my boyfriend ordered and it was even better, but to me it wasn't THAT great like everyone said it to be. Same with their truffle fries--quite delicious, but nothing too special.

Despite its deliciousness, I didn't think of it as being amazing as others think it is. I would come whenever I get the chance again, but it's nothing crave-worthy for me to come back ASAP."}
{"text":"It's good! Very very good! Yum yum yum give me some! and service has been bumped up a notch! Great job."}
{"text":"I go here with my colleagues for lunch. I am not a huge fan of red meat, but these burgers are delicious. My favorite burger is the Black and Green burger. They also offer specialty drinks like Apple Lychee soda and Cherry Yuzu soda. The service is great and they seat you quickly. I added this place to my favorite list."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger never fails!! Honestly the burgers here and the best I've ever had! They're great quality and taste amazing! The staff is friendly and welcoming. The oxtail fries are so good and any burger you try will satisfy! This is definitely my go-to for burgers!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the wait was long both for a table and longer for the food. The waitress was chatty and helpful.  I would probably go back, but the wife and kid said they never want to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive, friendly service. However, waitress did \"upsell\" to Wagyu beef for Kiki's burger. I'm not sure it made a difference. The bacon was underdone and flabby, so that was unpleasant. Strawberry lemonade was okay, but not worth $4.50"}
{"text":"The mad geniuses behind these crazy and amazing burgers at Bachi should receive a Nobel  Prize for their contributions to to mankind. Not to mention the fact that they have also curated a baddass beer list to accent every bite.  #hitachinoFTW 

Now while there isn't much that I can't tell you that hasn't already been talked about what I can offer you is a secret recipe for a Burger Boner which I came to acquire after eating the following items.  Please see below for the formula and note that you can substitute any variety of beer to achieve said boner, however the other 3 items must be eaten in their entirety.

Bachi Pickles + Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries + Hitachino + Shogun Burger =  BURGER BONER"}
{"text":"I love Bach I Burger there food is amazing! My favorite thing was there chili cheese fries with with he fried egg on top it was super good. The few times I've been there, it took a while for the food to come out, so just be expecting a wait. On the plus side I guess that means the food is cooked fresh."}
{"text":"Growing up in Hawaii, I always thought of \"bachi\" being what goes around comes around and usually with a negative connotation. However in this case, Bachi burger is serving up some pretty awesome burgers and sides and putting a new spin.

Asian take on an American classic is definitely not anything new, but doing it well is definitely the tricky part. Bachi Burger is definitely putting its mark on it and in a good way. The Miyagi-san burger uses a beautifully cooked wagyu patty with caramelized bacon, chili-mayo, onion rings, and a bit of furikake (dried seaweed) for salt. 

The oxtail fries was a good starting point with well cooked fries that were crisp on the exterior and steamy soft in the center. It was more chili style topping, but the the chili flavors were a tad overwhelming and didn't showcase the flavors of the oxtail, rather muted it.

Pork belly bao was well prepared with soft, but still firm pork topped with scallions, and a nice hoisin bbq sauce that gave the right balance of caramelized sugar and salt. The sliced boiled egg was decent and gave it nice color, but didn't really do anything to add for me.

Service was stellar and our server clearly knew the menu well and was ready to offer not only explanation, but reasoning behind suggestions. Food arrived in a good orchestration that kept our mouths busy and our tummy ready to digest. Ambiance is casual and nice, while its location seems to offer a plethora of parking and convenience to the neighborhood theatre next door.

All in all, if you are jones-ing for a new take on a burger, check out Bachi!"}
{"text":"I liked it.  There's no doubt about that, but I guess it just wasn't what I was looking for.  I love Japanese cuisine, and I enjoy pursuing the elusive, better-than-In-N-Out, perfect burger.  I only tried the Ronin Burger and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, but I wasn't left with the idea that I would be back.  (My bill came to about $25 without tip.)  The novelty wore off very quickly.

You'll enjoy your experience, however.  The restaurant itself was very busy--Los Angeles will have one of it's own this Fall, 2012--and the staff was very personable and all smiles.  The food is a new and refreshing twist on the sometimes commonplace hamburger, and the presentations are eye-catching, as you would expect with a Japanese influence.  Myself, I thought what I had ordered, which was highly recommended by our server and host, was too sweet.  I was expecting to bite into something that was much more robust.  Again, I hadn't tried everything; but for now, it's \"been there, done that.\""}
{"text":"I miss this place! Used to come here a lot when I lived on windmill.  Can't wait for the one by Village Square to open!  Burgers are delicious def. when you add a fried egg!   Big fan of the garlic fries as well :D"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had. I don't generally even like burgers. We got Spicy Miso burger and Kalbi burger. Garlic fries were amazing too!"}
{"text":"Warning: if you come here for happy hour, it ends at 6:00 NOT 6:30. The web site, the menu on the site AND the menu at the restaurant ALL say 6:30. But the waiter showed me they have 2 sets of menus that say both times. I told him that's horrible customer service. If it says 6:30, they should honor it or fix their site and menu!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!!! This place lives up to the hype. I just ate the best burger I have ever had in my life. The service is great too.

After telling our group about this place, we all went together the next day. I can't remember ever going to the same place 2 nights in a row but it was worth it."}
{"text":"First time here! Me and my girlfriend usually go to the one on Sahara and Fort Apache and we were a little nervous because our friends said it didn't taste as good as the one on Sahara but yeah the service was great nothing impressing but not bad at all. Food taste the same which was amazing! The only problem was the bill, our server forgot to fix the price of our fries because it supposed to be happy our which is 50% off appetizer but for some odd reason one of the thing we order weren't 50% off which upset me a little but it was okay so overall not bad but will not return only because I prefer the Sahara one better"}
{"text":"Back again! This time I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger along with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. Although the burger was good it didn't \"blow me away\" I thought about giving this trip only 4 stars but then I remembered the OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES!! It definitely  blew me away! Back to 5 stars easily! 

I actually had a brain fart by asking the server if we could get a half order because I saw the sign outside that they offered half order oxtail chili cheese fries for happy hour. Thank God he said no, because I don't think I could share a half order with my gf! We would be fighting! LOL

Next time I'll stick with the Bahn Mi or Kalbi burger. Yes NEXT TIME!!

Oh yeah my gf ordered her usual Kiki Burger."}
{"text":"This is a great place, especially for the price. It rivals Holsteins and BurGR for quality, but at a better price. Our server was very friendly, patient, and answered my multiple questions about their different sauces. We shared the egg onion ring burger and the mushroom burger. They were both awesome - even my son's burger was surprisingly good for a kids' burger! My son scarfed his whole burger, and he is usually a slow eater. The truffle fries were great with the mushroom sauce and sun dried tomato aoli. The spiked milkshake was good too, a little strong, but who would complain about that?! What's not to love about grass-fed wagyu beef, funakoke seasoning, Vietnamese mint... It was a blend of happy ingredients having a party in my mouth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I entered bachi burger with the thought of exotic flavors and delicious high-quality beef. Though the beef may have been exceptional, we both were disappointed with how overpowering the flavors were of everything else other than the beef. Cooked perfectly at medium, we would have liked the burger to not be completely overshadowed by what was an addition to it. 

He got the Miyagi-San burger which tasted more like sushi than it did hamburger (and I took a bite of it!) I got the Ronin burger where I thought the Katsu BBQ sauce was way too sweet and made it hard to keep eating.

Call me \"old-fashioned\" or \"all-American\" but I'll take a Great Burger where I taste the beef before these two options any day, 

For $40 + dollars, we had two burgers, two sides of fries, a beer and a green tea. I hoped to actually enjoy my meal rather than us question to one another whether the burgers were worth even worth eating. 

We found more enjoyment giggling over the green sunglasses with no lenses, neon orange shirt wearing hipster next to us than our food. I was so excited about this place. But it just wasn't good, in our opinion.

Wait... the fries were good! Two stars."}
{"text":"I usually love the food here. However, I came here on a lunch break and our food took longer than 30 min to arrive! I understand they have to have time to  cook the burgers but even the Caesar Salad took forever. If they improve their service, this restaurant would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I first went to Bachi Burger last summer. My story seems to match everyone else's - good food but slow service. Shortly after my review, I received a message from Ehren stating that they had made improvements. I'm happy to report that this is indeed the case. Granted, I don't know how much faster the food came out. For sure, it didn't take 40 minutes this time. We had a large group of Yelpers and many ordered appetizers that trickled out at various times. Also, time isn't so much an issue when you're enjoying the company of a big group. Still, I noticed little things that demonstrate their attention to detail and I could tell that they've put in the work to improve.

So how was the food? The food quality at Bachi Burger has never been a concern. On this visit, I went with the Bachi Fish. I also went all out and added their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to my order. The Bachi Fish was out of this world. Easily one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had, the cod was perfectly cooked and the flavors mingled together to create an enjoyable experience in each bite. As for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, they were good. The thing is, they might as well have been regular Chili Cheese Fries. I could definitely see there was Oxtail in it. I just wish it was more prominent.

The advantage of being in a big group is in the sampling of other people's dishes. Elnino ordered the Chili flavored Edamame and they were delicious. Someone else passed around a plate of Bachi Chili Fried Chicken. They were tender, flavorful, and came with a great dipping sauce. For me, the huge surprise was the Bachi Pickles platter that Nelson ordered. In particular, those cloves of garlic were insanely good. I'm definitely ordering that next time.

Well done Bachi Burger. You've really changed my perception of your establishment. My only regret is that it took me so long to come back."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Kalbi burger, medium rare, with some truffle fries!

Didn't really care for the loco moco. I like my loco mocos simple and not overly dramatic with fancy ingredients, which some places tend to serve. The jasmine rice they serve it with is like mush and when you eat it with the meat, it's too mushy. I see why they throw in some onion rings.

I tried the Portuguese donuts... and it's nothing like malasadas. They are deep fried donut balls served on a smear of fresh berry jelly (I think it was strawberry). The bread was overcooked on the outside and almost raw on the inside. I wouldn't try it again even if it was cooked better.

This location is nice and clean with somewhat of a hipster vibe. I have one gripe and it's the finish they use on the tables. I know it's for waterproofing the wood, but I find it too sticky at times and sometimes the napkins get stuck. It just reminds me of a soiled, sticky, poorly cleaned table.

I will come back to try the kalua pig benedict and see what that's like."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and is in a great low key location ... my kids loved their food too!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure ... not much of a burger guy, but always seek out the highly recommended locations when away from home. Bachi came with a strong recommendation and I joined a work team on our lunch break. The Oxtail Chili Cheese fries were ordered as a starter .. Wow! Even if you're not a fry person you better order them for the experience .. only need one for the table.

To the burger ... the waiter did a fantastic job with his descriptions and recommendations. I went with the Black & Green burger. What an explosion of flavor!! 

It's gems like this I wish we had on the east coast. Great flavor, great menu and great service."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has been nominated as one of the best burgers in town. I guess stats do not lie! This is by far one of the best burgers restaurants out there. The most popular burger would be the Kikis burger. Every burger is perfectly cooked. The meat is so juicy that it will drip on your fingers. The flavor is so unique and tasty! My mouth is just getting super watery just thinking about it. The burgers are not the only good thing here. The truffle fries are bomb!- must try-

They have a decent selection of items and you cannot go wrong with any of them! 
Oh and did I mention they have happy hour on some of their appetizers! Happy hr Monday- Friday 3-6 PM."}
{"text":"Rented a car just to visit this place for lunch.  We were not disappointed.  Menu is unique and worth the trip."}
{"text":"First time visitor, and everything we had was great. The burger was cooked perfectly, the oxtail chili fries were great, and the price quite reasonable. Looking forward to coming here again.  I had the Manga Burger which was a special that day.  This place is unlike any burger place you have ever tasted. All quality products and great staff. The service is outstanding, the wait staff was right on top of things. If another opportunity comes around I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Reading all these reviews I feel like the \"banh mi\" burger isnt getting as much rave as it should, I mean.... Guy from Diners Drive Ins and Dives did come here to eat that and loved it! It's possibly the best burger I've ever had. The myagi burger isnt as flavorful. The oxtail chili fries isnt as great as I expected, it was too sweet for my taste. And it's really big!!! I"}
{"text":"Love it. My new favorite restaurant!! Great food, super cool staff. Friendly, very clean!!! Good beer on tap, full bar. Order ANY of the fries. Eat them fresh  (fries never travel well). and the PINEAPPLE KETCHUP Mmmmm. YES, i will for sure return to Bachi Burger on Russell. The Wagyu burger was delicious!  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Ever have that placed that itched and you couldn't scratch it? Well yeah, this scratched my burger itch this morning. It's located in a discreet plaza across from Vons and it's probably safe to say it's always packed. Very good food. Options galore and very tasty unique take on cocktails. Oxtail fries are bomb.com. Give your mouth and brain a treat and head on down!!!"}
{"text":"When they first opened, I thought it was a bit pricey and the food was good. I heard they got new owners and this is what happened:

{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries are amazing!! The burgers are cooked to order and honestly, I don't think there is anything on the menu that isn't fantastic. This is a great place to go when you want a burger outside the box. The service was good, they were super attentive at first and then it slowed down but still a great experience. If you order a Caesar salad, watch out for the anchovies, they actually use real anchovies..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here when we went to Vegas, and it was definitely good. It's located in a strip mall, so not the best location, but the atmosphere inside is nice. Waiters were nice, and the food was brought out in a timely manner. We were also seated quickly, though the restaurant didn't look too packed.

I got their salted caramel shake, and their truffle parmesan fries because I wasn't too hungry. Shake was great, but probably bad idea to pair with the fries. I wasn't crazy about a particular flavor on the fries that I couldn't pin-point. They had a fishy flavor to them, which I wasn't quite liking. My boyfriend got the banh mi burger, and he really loved it."}
{"text":"I try to eat off the strip as much as possible when rolling out to vegas so I had to give Bachi Burger a try.  The Sahara location is in a plaza with a movie theater and other restaurants.  On the particular day I was dining, the weather in Vegas was extremely hot and it felt really warm in the restaurant as well.  The thought of eating greasy burgers and fries and sitting in the heat wasn't so pleasant but nonetheless we had arrived already and extremely famished from partying the night before!  My friends and I shared some oxtail chili cheese fries and they were really good!  I loved the fried egg on top with the oozing yolk, yum!  We ordered some onion rings and they were very average, kind of bland to be honest.  I ordered the Miyagi san burger it was good but nothing mind blowing.  I always compare burgers to the likes of Umami burger and father's office. Bachi's came a little bit short.  My patty was requested at medium but came out extremely well done and charred.    It wasn't particularly busy for lunch so I'm not sure what happened.  I also thought my burger was a little bit bland.  It was pretty juicy but just lacked a bit of seasoning.  The portion size is large enough to fill you up for sure.  When Bachi opens up in LA, i'd definitely give this chain another shot. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I have sat down here today to enjoy a meal with my vegetarian wife. She ordered a Caesar salad. The meal arrives with chicken, no big deal. Order comes back with the majority of the chicken removed by the chef, but with a few pieces still present. The server was asked have you just removed the chicken, server denied. The meal got sent back with a snotty reply from the server about being treated respectfully while I was refusing to pay and sharing my reasons without raising my voice or swearing. Disgusting and I will never return."}
{"text":"I'm going to cut to the chase since many have written novels on how great this place is.

The restaurant is nicely decorated, and has enough space to feel comfortable.  The staff is friendly and can offer decent recommendations.  

I ordered the Kiki's burger, truffle fries, and the Japanese tomatoes w/mozzarella appetizer.

The burger was delicious, definitely recommend if you like mushrooms.  The patty was cooked to perfection and the bacon added that last kick to make the burger perfect.  

The fries were definitely good but could have used more truffle sauce and I don't recommend getting the tomato appetizer unless you feel like spending some extra dough on a nicely presented unique appetizer.

Only downfall i would say is that you end up spending around 20 bucks on a burger with fries and drink, but that price sure beats burger bar."}
{"text":"So if you are in the Vegas area, and are on a Burger hunt.. We'll you've come to the right place....If you haven't been...you definitely are missing out.  So out-of-towners...If you have a rental...Bet your bottom dollar you'd wanna make the effort to come here.  

The burgers are fresh, and has a spin when compared to your all american burger.  Their specialty are the burgers with the Asian twist to them.  The meat is thick and moist.  Very different, original and tasty! They have quite a few selections but I've only tried the Kiki burger and Ronin, both of which are good...wait I lied! I've also tasted the KimChi burger from a friend's plate= This burger was decent...a bit weird for me since I didn't know what to think of the kimchi veggies combined with my burger... Bachi Burger does have a small selection of your all american burgers but the waiter will advise you that people usually don't come to order those.  

I've also tried their Ox tail chili cheese fries....De-LIcious!!! They even include a sunny side up on top of the thing.  :) Makes me happy just to think of this dish.  My friend ordered the bbq pork bun dish (its one of the three pictures I have up) ...I think they were good, but for the price, I think i've had better.  

The only thing I think would make this burger not so appealing to people is if they are like me: I simply like less meat (like the amount you get in a cheeseburger at in N out).  I usually go with others who I gladly separate the pattie in two and hand half of it over to someone else.  The thing is, there is too much meat for me and that isn't a problem when you could share it with others (having too little would be a problem as you would have to maybe order more). :) 

Come people!

{"text":"If I'm going to splurge for a burger this is my place. Great food, accommodating staff, and nice craft beer.  A few more good experiences and I'll raise my rating."}
{"text":"Flies and (possible) case of mild food poisoning. 
Well, originally I would have only taken off a single star for being too cheap to serve Coke, and instead having Pepsi. I've personally never heard a customer explicitly ask for a Pepsi, but I have seen people change their drink order from Coke to water, once they are informed apologetically that the restaurant only serves Pepsi. I've never understood why owners would consider saving a couple of bucks a month more important than giving customers what they want. 
As for the food itself, it was very good. I also found the pineapple ketchup to be unique and very tasty. 
The real problem was that the place was full of flies! It was pretty difficult to enjoy my food while defending it, and myself from the flies. It was pretty disconcerting when one actually flew into my ear! I noticed that I wasn't the only customer spending his time trying to swat the flies away. When the waiter came by to ask me if I needed anything, I told him that I could use a fly swatter. Apparently, judging by the smirk, he either didn't get the not so subtle hint, or couldn't be bothered with trying to fix the problem. Upon leaving, I noticed that they were doing work outside on the chairs. Most likely they couldn't be bothered with closing the back door. 
Of course, this was only a mild discomfort, compared to the stomachache and three hurried trips to the bathroom a few hours later. Without expounding too much about what was happening to my GI system, I'm pretty sure the food gave me a mild case of food poisoning. 
I'll not be returning to or recommending this restaurant. 
Maybe this is the real meaning of, \"bachi\"."}
{"text":"Great burgers at great prices. I had the Kiki burger, which was so good. I also had a bite of the Miyagi-San, which was fantastic too. Both were cooked to medium (perfectly) and the patty was super tender and juicy. The portion size was just right, although I ended up saving a little bit of it for the drive home. It was still delicious!

Another must was the ox-tail chili cheese fries. I accidentally bit my lip and caused it to bleed when I saw it arrive, just to give you an idea of how good it looked. It's a little expensive but the oxtail is so flavorful. Best of all, the chili is not watery, which I hate!

Can't wait to come back. Or to go to the one opening in LA!"}
{"text":"A nice change from your normal burger joint. Unique burger, great sides and apps. If your into beer they have a small but great selection. Oh and if you can only order one thing it has to be the oxtail chili cheese fries. CRAZY GOOD!"}
{"text":"Was on dirty dinning cockroach infested... Company doesn't care about your health ... I wouldn't go ..."}
{"text":"4 stars on the food, I was here with a group and we all loved our burgers (we each got a different one).  So that will get me to come here again and give this place another shot.

1 star service.  Just awful.  This place seriously needs to hire more waiters, that was half the problem.  Maybe some older or more experienced waiters.  Our waitress literally walked off in the middle of us ordering or asking for something more than once.  So of course a few things were not correct the first time.  We asked for water (for the whole group, after we had been in need of refills for awhile, and no one ever asked if we needed anything the whole meal) and she came up and refilled ONE GLASS, with everyone clearly needing more water.  She was not friendly at all and she seemed very spaced out and sulky at the same time.

So if you come here, better order plenty of drinks in advance and be prepared to wait a long time for a table, and then wait a long time for food.  But the food was excellent.  Except for my bubble tea, it was not very flavorful."}
{"text":"This was my husband and mine second time coming to Bachi burger. We tried the other location first because we came on a Monday by mistake and it was closed. So we decided to try this location since they have a lil'different menus at each place. This location felt a little smaller. Wasn't busy, but it was the last hour before closing. 

We both ordered the Kiki burger and of course truffle fries. Love those fries. The waiter we had had only been there for a few weeks, very attentive and offered alot of suggestions. Even tried the alcoholic punch. Was really good, couldn't taste any alcohol in it which could be dangerous, but great suggestion by the waiter. 

Very clean and nice there. Definitely would come back again. The first time I tried the black and blue burger and that was amazing at the other location. Liked trying the different burgers each time we go."}
{"text":"These people never have ramen because according to them their \"plumbing is always messed up.\" That's disgusting. The service is AWFUL-- AND NOW THEY ARE CLOSED COMPLETELY."}
{"text":"Wow... I had no idea how good a burger could taste. This place and Holstein's are my two favorites. If you're tired of flat backyard burgers, this place can open up new flavor horizons."}
{"text":"The wait was 20 mins long when we arrived on a Sunday at noon. We ordered a spicy miso burger, ronin burger, and a side of sweet potato fries. The burgers definitely have an asian flare to them. I can definitely tell that the restaurant provided us with fresh ingredients. I think we inhaled the burgers in less than 10 mins. The burgers aren't cheap, but certainly aren't expensive considering that you are paying for quality."}
{"text":"Eek! 'Methinks not' is right. Pretty good service, but let's just say that I've tasted better. Much better. The Ronin burger was MUCH too sweet. I couldn't even taste the patty because of the overbearing sugary flavor of the caramelized onions that flooded the burger. What a letdown. A few words of advice. Don't get the Ronin."}
{"text":"You live this life once; so why not treat yourself to a nice meal once in awhile. After hiking in Red Rock Canyon that is what my brother did. Except, that it wasn't intended for here. We headed to the Gordon Biersch in Boca Fashion Village only to find that it was gone. Bummer! In Sambalatte my brother and I went on Yelp where our fingers did the walking and the Yelpers did the talking. The Yelpers were talking positive things about Bachi Burger down Rampart Boulevard in the Village Square Shopping Center at the northwest corner of Sahara. Now it was time to do the eating. 

    I am no stranger to Bachi Burger. Oftentimes I drove by the Windmill at Bermuda location. I had read glowing articles about the famed burger in the local publications. Articles that included Las Vegas Weekly's reviewer Brock Radke placing Bachi Burger at number 19 in the most important restaurants of Las Vegas list. 

  I have been unfamiliar with the meaning of \"bachi.\" For your information, \"bachi\" means karma and a Japanese type of grill. 

  Bachi Burger blends in with the neighboring businesses of the renovated Village Square Shopping Center. It is hidden from both Rampart and Sahara Avenue. The movie theatre is the landmark. 

  On Sunday, February 14, 2016; at 6:30, we had the restaurant practically to ourselves. Immediately upon walking inside, we immediately landed a table. There were zero patrons between ourselves and the distant open kitchen. The picture below shows the restaurant scene. But anything can change in a Las Vegas minute. Near 7 pm; the tables surrounding us were filling up. 

  Bachi Burger reminds me more of an Asian restaurant than a burger place. I remember the drapes by the hallway leading to the restrooms. I also remember the comfortable seats and relaxing dining environment. 

   After examining the choices of burgers in the menu, I had my mind set on the Spicy Miso Burger plus a separate order of Just Fries, and Coke. At this point of the review, I need to bring up that a burger, fries, and beverage will come out to at least $20. 

   The Spicy Miso Burger was a colossal sandwich. I felt like I was in the dentist opening my mouth wide. Below is a picture of this beast of a burger. And this is a first-rate burger. The Bachi Burger website states that their burgers are made fresh from a combination of wet aged chuck, short rib and brisket certified beef. It was over and above the meat that delivered my taste buds to an elevated state of nirvana. Surrounding the Angus beef were onions, shishito pepper, mayonnaise, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, apple vinaigrette, and a fried egg. This brought back a recent memory on the Las Vegas Strip enjoying a unique Fukuburger. A consequence of my food exploring is an appreciation of an egg on a burger. Let me also state that in contrast to the name, there was an infinitesimal amount of spiciness in the Spicy Miso Burger. Colossal sandwiches are not meant to be enjoyed alone. The Just Fries complimented the burger. The fries were hot and fresh. They featured sea salt. The fries were part for the course of this dining adventure. This is the first time that I recall dipping fries in pineapple ketchup. 

   Throughout the dining adventure, our waiter Hugo provided commendable service. Past the conclusion of the meal, he never pressured my brother and I to leave when we were hanging out shooting the breeze. Additionally he was friendly. 

   You will live this life once. Why not experience Bachi Burger once. Local publications and several Yelpers rave about Bachi Burger. This review is confirmation that Bachi Burger lives up to the hype:


 The pictures from February 14, 2016:"}
{"text":"Everyone must try this place.

 My friends told me about this place, because they couldn't stop talking about how great their burgers and fries and pretty much everything on their menu were. I must admit I am one of the biggest fan. After dining here, I've been telling everyone they must come to this place.

From truffles on your fries, Foie Gras, and Delicious mouth-watering Burgers and so forth. I can't say enough.
 
Their quality of food is top notch.!!! I am in love with this place. 

this place has also been on the Food Network Channel Dine-Dinners and Dive In with Guy Fieri"}
{"text":"Buns were better than Umami Burger's. I can't give a better and more detailed review because I had only tasted a bite (too full from earlier) However, the truffled fries were much better at Umami. This place is open until 1am on Fridays and Saturdays. And it's merged with the Ramen place next door, so they have the Ramen menu available as well! Another reason to come back another time."}
{"text":"I try to go to as many restaurants as possible that are featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, so eventually I made my way to Bachi Burger. I knew about this place prior to it being on the show, but for whatever reason, I never ate here until this month. Not sure why it was featured because it's not a diner, drive-in, or dive.

In any case, I saw the oxtail chili cheese fries featured on the show and chose that for my lunch. My favorite Filipino food is my mom's kare-kare, so I'm definitely a fan of oxtail. The dish was heavy on the fries and the oxtail was sparse. The fried egg on top was a nice touch that gave some nice creaminess to the dish. The flavor was good and I enjoyed the concept, but for $11.50 I really expected more."}
{"text":"This place is pure excellence!  The first time here we ordered 5 different burgers and split them all to share.  It's hard to recommend one particular burger since they all were so good!  But, I can recommend you order a burger with a crunchy element to it.  The crunch really topped it off for me.  That's what set it apart and why we try to always make a stop when we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Have been looking forward to come here for a long time and I'm glad I did, because I won't be back.  The oxtail fries were great (hence why they got 3 stars) but the burgers were blah.  The meat was flavorless and is only complimented by the several different ingredients added to the burger.  The pork belly was pretty good but again mediocre because I can get this at Chinatown and it's just as good.  I really wish this place was as good as everyone says, but sorry, it's just not."}
{"text":"Everytime  we come to Vegas feom Miami.... this makes the list of places to eat. The food is always great!  A bit of a wait, but not too bad.  It's  worth the wait. You leave full and happy.  So good!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the weekend and wanted to try a local delicious burger spot! And I sure found one the garlic fries are super good with a hint of ginger ... Was a 40 min wait but it was worth it ! Wish they open one here in the South Bay in Los Angeles ! Hint hint :p"}
{"text":"It saddens me to have to write a bad review on a place I like so much but this experience was awful. We typically go to the one on Russell which is absolutely 5 stars but we decided to go to this one because it was open later; bad choice. Ordered 3 drinks and 2 waters, kids burger, Kiki burger (well done with an egg added) & miyagi burger (well done) & fries. Got our 2 teas and 1 soda, no water. Got all our burgers, even the kids one cooked medium rare, no egg on the burger and no fries. Ignored the egg and waited a few extra on the fries incase they were coming but nope never came. Had to tell a waiter who said he would go check and then came out saying they were coming up which means they were forgotten. A lady then comes out around 10 minutes later with the fries & the egg stating she apologized that they forgot the egg in the first place and it would be taken off the bill. For someone who likes runny eggs, you could tell this was rushed just like the fries, as the egg white, not the yolk, was still runny and the fries were soaked in oil. Definitely will not be returning to this location!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Ronin burger and oxtail fries.. definitely not a meal for one person. Chili cheese fries are enough to serve 2-4 people as a side. Ronin burger was really good but not over the top amazing. Suggest asking for to go boxes as soon as you get your meal. $11 fries and $12 burger. Would likely opt for sweet potato fries next go around."}
{"text":"This place is a must eat. Really!

The pork belly buns (like Peking duck) were outstanding!

I did the Kik Wagyu burger MedRare. It was very good, but not over the top great. 

Their wedge salad was crisp, fresh, and loaded. Light on dressing which was perfect!

Wife had the Just Fries for the sole purpose of trying the pineapple ketchup. Both were very good. Funny but she said fries reminded her of McDonald's!

Strawberry lemonade made from scratch was outstanding and bottomless. Not too sweet. Just the right amount of tart. 

I had a Sapporo draft. Bonus was a free glass if I checked in!  Sure!  Was told it was a fresh keg, but it could have been colder and the pour was a bit light, a finger short of the rim including head. 

Overall a solid 4 stars. 

Note their ramen shop next door is opening soon. 

I will be back each visit!"}
{"text":"BACHI BURGER, PLEASE COME TO ORANGE COUNTY!  WE WILL WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS!  I PROMISE.

So like a majority of reviewers, I too became entranced by Bachi Burger after seeing them on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  Despite the fact that Vegas is pretty much my home away from home, I never got the chance to hit up Bachi Burger until recently.  I was staying off the strip during EDC weekend, and was hungry.  Quickly Yelped something and Bachi Burger came up only a few miles away.  Finally!  The stars have aligned!  Bachi Burger it is.  

We got there around 3 pm, the perfect time in my opinion because the lunch rush was over but the dinner rush had not started.  The place looks pretty small from the front but is actually quite large once you explore inside.  It looks like it expanded recently.  Downside is that the bathrooms are single stall.  There were quite a few empty tables but they still had a slight wait, only 5-10 minutes or so.  Ken and I took those few minutes to glance over the menu.  

If you are looking for a burger place with an Asian twist and a lot of variety, seriously look no further than Bachi Burger.  EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING sounded delicious!  Not just their burgers but all the other things they had on the menu, baos to bone marrow, it was like a nice spectrum of food.  

We settled on the Kiki burger substitute Angus beef with Wagyu beef, the Ronin Burger and oxtail chili cheese fries.  Personally, I thought Bachi Burger had an amazing menu selection.  They were different than your other burger places because of their extensive menu.  The ingredients within the burgers were very good and complimented each other very well.  I will go into more details later but I have to say, meat patty wise, Bachi Burger was good but definitely not the best meat patty I have ever had.  I think what carries them is how unique and different their burger combinations are.

Oxtail Fries:  Order this!  Awesome starter dish or even the main dish, it was a pretty large dish and the fries came crispy.  The oxtail was tender and blended in well with the chili.  Ken asked why they called this oxtail chili cheese fries.  I picked up a piece of meat and showed it to him.  He seemed surprise that there was actual oxtail in the dish.

Kiki Burger:  It was an additional $3 to substitute Wagyu beef for Angus.  I did not taste much of a difference.  This burger has 3 different types of mushroom, carmelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade and gruyere cheese.  The gruyere cheese made it taste a lot like the Fathers Office burger from LA.  I did not really care much for this burger.  The many different mushrooms made it mushy and the gruyere cheese made me want Fathers Office.  

Ronin Burger:  Now this...this was good!  Carmelized Onion, Japanese slaw, fried egg, katsu bbq, and miso goma dressing.  Everything went together beautifully, it was very good.  I only ate half of the burger because I filled up on the fries and ended up eating the other half the next day, still delicious!  

I wish I could try more from their menu.  I am happy that they have locations in SoCal, but come on!  Expand to the OC, we will love you, I promise!  Just think about it?  Okay?"}
{"text":"Good is great, DELICIOUS IN FACT
I highly recommend oxtail fries, and the Miso burger. Both are delicious.
However, service really wasn't so great.
They're slow - brought the wrong beer ( luckily I know the difference in taste )
also, only one waitress was able to bring me the sauce that I wanted, the others mistook it for something else and brought that."}
{"text":"In Vegas for business and I wanted something off the strip.  I saw this place on Yelp and it looked like it was right up my alley.

Beer - 
So I live on the East Coast and Dogfish Head is somewhat local.  They had some excellent Dogfish Head beers that I had never heard of.   They also had what is now one of my favorite beers on the planet called Hitachino Nest IPA - this is Japanese Micro Brew and it was phenomenal.  Thank you Bachi Burger!

Food - 
I had the pickled vegetable appetizer.   Very cool and tasty.  For $4 I had to try it.  Then I had the Bahn Mi burger - outstanding.  i highly recommend this place.  I spent as much on beer as I did food and it was money well spent.  I will be going back next time I'm in Vegas for sure.

In a strip mall, next to a tanning salon, this wonderful place is very nondescript, don't let looks fool you."}
{"text":"Solid lunch/dinner spot for all burger lovers. The wait can be pretty long during peak times, but that's because there aren't many seats in the restaurant. However, the hostess gave us great comfort by constantly checking on us and giving us frequent updates. I greatly appreciated that and wanted to make sure I called that out. The wait staff is also very good. They are constantly coming around and turn tables as quickly as they can. No complaints there.

In terms of the burger, it's a mixed bag. I got the Wagyu Burger & it was tasty. You can tell the beef was high quality. It was tender, juicy, and filling. My brother and father had the Ronin Burger & Kim-Chee burgers. Both were interesting as \"must-try once\" type of entrees. The Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries were average. They were standard chili cheese fries, but we couldn't really taste the Ox-tail. Nevertheless, this is a great place to try if you can venture off the strip."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We waited 50 (!) minutes for two burgers and fries (don't they have those ready to go?). and the restaurant was busy, but not crazy busy. The waitress didn't even check in on us until we asked a co-worker what was up. Too bad - the food is really good!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE!!! 

Put our names in and told it would be a 20 minute wait.....35 minutes later AND after watching them take 2 parties of 4 who arrived after us we were told \"sorry we didn't see your name\" and asked us to wait for the next table. I enjoy their food but unfortunately I will never go back again as the service was so horrible it's not even worth it."}
{"text":"I hate to be the buzz killer in the new buzzing restaurant on Yelp, but I feel I have to.

@ Jasmine Green Milk Tea w/ Boba ($3.50) - This is about the price for boba drinks if you go to a boba place. In the taste department, it was good. Nothing really special that makes them stand out like Easy Life Boba or Boba City Cafe.

@ Taro w/ Boba ($3.50) - Someone in our group got this. Taro was fine, but they said the boba wasn't cooked in the center. My boba seem fine though.

@ Truffle Parmesean Fries ($3.50) - Very good and flavorful fries, mainly because of the truffle oil. This reminds me of the awesome truffle fries at ENVY, except a lot cheaper. Probably the best fries to get out of their offerings.

@ Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries ($3.50) - Good and flavorful as well. Taste almost identical to the truffle fries, except without the truffles. Just stick with the truffle fries, you'll get a stronger better flavor. One point I have to ding them on is the cone shape containers serving the fries makings it seem like you're getting more than you really are. Cool presentation but not good for my tummy. I also noticed that someone else from the other table go more fries than us. *Shakes fist*

@ BBQ Bachi Burger American Wagyu w/ Cheese ($9 + $1 Cheese) - First bite made me say yes finally a restaurant burger worth its price, I can actually taste the difference in using quality ingredients. I should have spent the extra $3 to get an extra patty. Is there a limit to the # of patties I can get? Like can i get a 100x100 Wagyu burger (bwhaha).

@ Ronin Burger & Kiki Burger ($8 each) - The others in our group got this. One says its a lot better than the stuff at Fuddruckers. Both happy with their burger.

@ Peking Duck Steamed Buns + Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($8.50) - One person in our group decided to split the orders, so he got to try 1 of each item. This item reminds me in Vegas. Calling something Asian fusion and charging up the wazu for it. This is literally 2 buns with meat in it. Literally. You can get comparable items at Diamond bakery for a $1.25 each, a boba drink at Volcano Tea, and a banh mi sandwich at Hue Thai for a little more than the cost of this item and that would fill you up.  Sure you get a hard boiled egg and I get some salad, but thats still some crazy markup. Either charge less for this item, or give some more value for this item. This is more of an appetizer than an entree. 

@ Portuguese Donuts w/ Vietnamese Cinnamon + Coffee Gelato ($4) - This is donut holes with cinnamon and a side of coffee ice cream. So Portuguese donuts is a type of donut. But WTF is Vietnamese cinnamon? The waitress said its just cinnamon and it sure is. The donuts were okay (like you have to try to make a donut taste bad), but stuff at Ronalds taste a lot better. The coffee gelato ice cream is just okay as well. I guess they wanted to take a twist on coffee and donuts.

@ Cherry Glazed Pop Tart w/ Gelato ($4) - Pop Tart? I think everyone has memories of those Kellogs Pop Tarts you toast into a toaster as a child. Well now that we're all grown up and more sophisticated, we have a restaurant pop tart. The combo of the pop tart and gelato is good. Has a good flakey crust. Definitely something to order if you don't want a coffee based desert.   

Service is very friendly. They ensure that everything is good and ask if you need anything. When the kitchen got backed up, the waitress did acknowledge this and apologized.

The wait time is a little ridiculous. I don't expect fast food times, but 30 mins is a little ridiculous. Then another 20 minutes for desert. The kitchen got backed up, but how do you get backed up with only 2 table orders? I can imagine how bad it might get when this place gets filled up to a higher occupancy rate.  

New restaurants are traditionally understaffed, but surprising this place seem overstaff . On a Friday night, you have 4 waitresses, with only 6 tables with patrons. Over staff at the front of the house much? It seems like there was 1 person solely just making boba drinks, but I saw the waiters making the drinks as well. Then you have another person who looks to be manning the cashier and not doing much. Then you have the overseeing owner or manager taking care of paperwork. With all of these people \"busy\", you have 2 cooks in the kitchen. Maybe they need to devote more staff to getting the food out in a timely fashion, instead of doing damage control towards its patron for the long wait.

The food is good no doubt. But pricing on some items is questionable. Just because something is Asian Fusion or you give it a fancy name, doesn't mean you can charge more for it. They have a friendly staff, but they also need to work on getting food out in a more timely fashion. A great restaurant that might have a bright future if they address some of these issues."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had.  Period.  Took my friend to it 3 days later.   Same experience.  Great burger.   Ordered the kiki burger w/o bacon both times.

Its not fast food so don't expect to be in and out in 20 minutes.  Service was pretty good too.  Only critique would be that the chairs are not very comfortable - but overall a great meal."}
{"text":"I only give this restaurant one star because I never actually ate or stayed for an entire dining experience. My boyfriend and I had heard lots of great things about this restaurant and wanted to check out the hype, but once we arrived we waited in the front lobby for five minutes for a host to come to front and seat us. We were seated at a table in the midst of the busy restaurant and while everyone was either served or acknowledged, we were not. Plenty of employees walked by and yet no one said a word to us. After about ten minutes of sitting at your table without a single employee acknowledging our presence or apologizing for the wait, we got up and left. We would've appreciated at least an employee that apologized for the wait or said \"I'll be right back to take your order.\" But no. If a restaurant doesn't want to act like our service is important, then I don't need to dine and spend my money there. Overall just horrible service for what's supposed to be a \"gourmet\" experience."}
{"text":"I loved the food but the wait was too long and when we ordered a takeout we were not allowed to eat there which was a little disappointing in spite of the bar space (which I believe is one) being open. I ordered the lonely bird and my husband ordered the miyagi san's grass feb burger and they both tasted awesome! Only downside was I asked my burger without the tomatoes and they gave me one with tomatoes in it."}
{"text":"This place is F*cking Awesome!!! Ventured into the Vegas suburbs to try this Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives recommendation and left with a hefty food baby. My husband and I eat semi-paleo, so we replaced regular with sweet potato for the oxtail chili cheese fries appetizer. It was amazing. I wanted to take the plate back to the strip, find a drive-through wedding chapel, and marry it. For dinner, he got the spicy miso burger and I got the Mr. Ho's burger (both bun less, of course). The meat was high quality, and the toppings were super tasty. I wish they would open a Bachi Burger in Phoenix. I'll be back the next time I'm in Sin City!!!"}
{"text":"yummy yummy yummy

they need to open a location in san diego.

i had the kalbi burger.  tasted like mom's food served between two yummy buns.

the oxtail french fry thing was to die for."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Bachi Burger and it was excellent! I didn't think I'd care much about this place since there are many burger joints around the valley, but I was really impressed. We were seated shortly upon arrival and was given enough time to look over the menu. I ordered the Bachi Fish and my family's orders consisted of Kiki's Burgers, The Lonely Bird, No Meat Here... 'Burger', Kid's Grilled Cheese, Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries, and Truffle Parmesan Fries.

The Bachi Fish was reallllly gooood!! The bun was nice and soft and perfectly toasted. The veggies were fresh and crisp. The fish was a good amount and very tasty. The fries were very good as well, crispy and the seasonings and sauces complimented them very well. I think everyone with me enjoyed their food too because they cleared their plates!

Our server was friendly and attentive enough, answered our questions, and did her job with a smile. The looks of the restaurant was nice and welcoming.

Overall, I'd be back again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger restaurant. I live in LA but every time I go to Vegas (which is quite often) I have to grab a burger here before coming home. My favorite is the Miyagi-San but I can't say I've had an underwhelming burger here. All the flavors with each burger work well together. I can't wait for the LA location to open so I don't have to drive 300 miles to get a good burger ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is priced reasonably considering the quality and the portion of the food. Everything is fresh, staff is friendly... Definitely worth the visit"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, incredible oxtail chili cheese fries, and great service. They have fresh buns and adult milkshakes! This is one of the best burgers in town! 
As a burger connoisseur, this is a must visit place. The menu is really fun but with a Korean twist. The Bachi pickles are a fun fresh twist on kimchi, but tastier. They serve the yummiest green tea. The fries are addicting and freshly made. I highly recommend you read through the burger descriptions to find exactly what you're craving!"}
{"text":"The burgers are of the highest quality, with an Asian flair. The oxtail chili cheese fries are amazing and bountiful enough to share. Bachi pickles are a fun, light opener to any meal. Today I tried to white peach sangria, and Portuguese sausages which were also fun appetizers.the bottomless matcha green tea is the best I've ever had! 
Oopps....time for dessert!"}
{"text":"Last time we came here the wait was so long we decided to get a Togo order. We waited an hour for our Togo order ! AN HOUR! 
so this time, we decided to give them another shot. We called in to get a to go order for pick up. The person who answered the call transfered us to a server. When the server answered I was just making sure that the food would be ready by the quoted time, the server's response was \"we can give you a quoted time but if it goes over that time, it's not our fault. So you can either come in and put it an order or take the chances by calling\". (In such a rude tone) HORRIBLE. As good of a food you have, this location has bad service ! 

I'd rather get my food somewhere else or drive all the way to the one on Sahara and fort apache. I hope they make another location so I won't be stuck not getting a bachi burger since this is the one nearby my house. Never again will I come back here nor would I recommend this location to someone else"}
{"text":"These burgers are delicious! The meat is consistently cooked perfectly based on your order & the fries are delicious & a nice change of pace compared to your regular fries.  I recommend the garlic truffle fries with sauce. My suggestion when coming here though is do NOT make changes to the burger you order.  These burgers have been specially crafted to meet a specific flavor profile, making changes to them really diminishes the flavor they were designed for. Well worth your time & $$!"}
{"text":"Can I just give this place more than 5 stars?!!! 

I LOVE LOVE LOVE BACHI BURGER!!!!! I was introduced to this burger spot when I first moved to vegas and has been my favorite spot every time. I bring all my fam and friends here when they come into town and they loved it!

Favorites: Spicy miso burger with a fried egg is so juicy and delicious!!! Must order their truffle parmesan fries & garlic fries which are so good as well!!

As everyone have mentioned, the wait is crazy but it is so worth the wait. I promise you! Try to get there as soon as they open or else you could be waiting up to an hour and a half to be seated. Go! Go! Go!"}
{"text":"While in Vegas my spouse and I ha a chance to visit a few eatery and Bachi was the best on the list"}
{"text":"I love your food,  but tonight you guys did horrible, the cook shouldn't be arguing with the servers. My burger was burnt, even though I asked for medium well. 
The Filipino dude working all the tables. I love u guys, tonight 100% fail. The Ramen was delicious. Wish i got my money back 100%. Hope u do better next time."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place ever!! The fish burger was great and the soft buns are Awesome!!! Love the truffle flavored fries. The staff was very nice and accommodating. You guys rock, I told my friends to try Bachi Burgers. Because of this positive experience, I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my To Do list since it opened some 4 years ago.  We decided to share 2 different Asian influenced burgers.  The Ronin burger included caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq and yuzi citrus aioli plus Kiki's - sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aiole.  

We also shared an order of sweet potato fries with yuzi citrus aioli.  At first glance I could not imagine how I would get my mouth around the burgers, but most of the height came from the soft roll as the actual angus patty likely weighed in at a 1/3 of a pound.  We both felt Kiki beat out Ronin and, though the overall experience was good, I did not feel wowed by the experience and consider the burgers to be overpriced."}
{"text":"These burgers were great! Staff was friendly and courteous. When in town again, I will Be back! Thank you"}
{"text":"We met up another family because we were so excited about ordering the oxtail fries.  The atmosphere was nice.  It was a little bright inside.  Very casual.

All of us ordered different burgers.  However, the burgers did not include any sides.  The only good thing about the burger were the buns.  Very soft and moist.

The oxtail fries were not what we expected.  There were only 3 thinly sliced jalapenos.  The oxtail stew looked like regular chili.  You can hardly taste the oxtail.  It was a bit salty.

We were expecting more out of this place.  We've tasted better burgers.  Even home style burgers tasted better.  I would have rather had In-N-Out.  At least they have combos which include fries and a drink.

The only reason people come to this place is because of the name.  Would not recommend anyone to Bachi."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice this year. My favorite burger place as of this moment. Oxtail chili cheese fries were on point. I got the kalbi burger which was awesome. Sooo freaking good. I need to try the fish burger next time. I'm so glad I live like 3 miles from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food has been consistently fabulous. Most recently, I tried the Vegetarian-friendly NO MEAT HERE... \"BURGER\" and it was good. It wasn't amazing (like their other burgers), but the fact that they had a well-constructed and thoughtful dish for Vegetarians was awesome enough for me. It featured a shiitake mushroom patty, Japanese eggplant, tofu, red bean, mixed greens, and chili lime vinaigrette on a wheat bun. Pretty cool. I also LOVE their TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES and SALT & PEPPER GARLIC FRIES. The toppings are amazing and the aiolis are addicting (especially that Garlic Chili Aioli, drool). The other burgers I've enjoyed several times are the RONIN BURGER, KIKI'S BURGER, and SPICY MISO BURGER. Serious drool action all over the board. I've had the OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES once and they're pretty amazing too. Basically, I haven't had anything bad. I do enjoy the boba milk tea drinks as well. They're not the best boba drinks, but decent for a craving. The BACHI SAKE SANGRIA is really great too and unassuming.

The SHOGUN BURGER is really great! Loved the pan-seared foie gras and although I couldn't distinguish the Yamamomo Peach and Asian Pear really well, it added a nice sweetness to this rich sandwich. The Wagyu Beef was delicious as well. The Unagi seemed unnecessary though; it didn't add anything significant for me - taste or texture - and it kind of took away from the two main ingredients (Wagyu and Foie Gras). I also tried the SWEET POTATO FRIES for the first time along with my two favorite staples and it was okay. I liked the freshness and it not being salty, but with other amazing fry options, this doesn't come close.

We did have one bad customer service experience where we ended up leaving without dinner and going to another restaurant. It was a rather busy night (and I'm sure they have lots of those) and the communication with seating availability was horrendous. Especially since I had called ahead. There was lack of organization and the gentleman that appeared to be the manager poorly handled the situation. It was really disappointing. Very \"off-putting\" and since I'm a regular, it wasn't a complete deterrent, however, for my friends, it was bad enough to not warrant another visit. Not a way you want to lose customers! Otherwise, the service is just okay. Which is a real shame with food so delicious.

Update: I haven't visited this location for over a year because of my last experience. I have been to their Summerlin location a few times and prefer it MUCH more. The service is substantially better and it's not as crowded (no tourists!). I would stay away from this location."}
{"text":"So, I'm already a big fan of Bachi Burger as I've visited their Windmill location numerous times. What prompted me to visit this location was based on the last three unsuccessful experiences I had at the other location -- hour-long waits and unhelpful individuals. I almost gave up on Bachi Burger, even though that would have hurt me more than it hurt them. One evening, my friend and I remembered their Summerlin location and fortunately, it was approximately the same distance from our homes, so we decided to give them chance.

Our experience was wonderful from start to finish. There was no other parties waiting and we were approached immediately. After checking in with us, we were told that it would be 5-10 minutes (though a little odd since, again, there was no one waiting and half the restaurant was empty tables). We were just happy that it wasn't 45-60 minutes! However, before we could even get comfortable with a Seven magazine, we were escorted to our table with a sincere apology (for the wait) from the hostess. We told her, \"Don't be ridiculous, we hardly waited!\" Our server was friendly and attentive; we were so delighted.

I went with my usual Spicy Miso Burger and Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries. All very, very delicious. For dessert, I opted for a boba milk tea drink. I couldn't decide between Almond and Taro Coconut, so our server recommended a blend of the two, exclaiming that it was her favorite drink! Of course, I had to and it was delicious. 

I'm definitely coming back, however, to this location only and hopefully they don't let their popularity get to their heads like their sister location."}
{"text":"This was a great side trip during the last bachelor's party. It's a short ride from the Strip and located in the corner of a strip mall. No better place than this, I wish I was there right now. We went here after the advice of Guy Fieri's Triple D... I'm a huge fan of his books.

Five hungry guys devoured their food quickly. Oxtail? YES. Smothered on fries? HELL YES.  With an egg on top? WHY IS IT NOT IN FRONT ME OF YET?

The different choices of burgers made it a great place for our different tastes. I had the Kim Chi burger and oh my.. it was delicious. Banh Mi burger? Oh yeah.. I'll have one of those too. If I had a larger stomach and a bigger wallet, I would've ordered a few more burgers. Definitely worth the side trip.

Tip: If you're expecting to go there by cab, make sure you have a cab driver's number. After our meal, we couldn't find a cab to go back to the strip even after calling 10 different taxi companies, luckily for us, we found a taxi waiting at the local dentist."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Bachi, the food always taste great. I love their veggie burger! Yumm! I would give this place five stars if the service gets better. The last time I was here with my friends we got into an argument with the manager. We left the place very upset. But I will still come back for their good food."}
{"text":"banh mi sandwich is pretty bomb, so were the garlic pepper fries. The service is really good also, only reason I am giving them 4 instead of 5 is because the place is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Great Place to eat.. Great customer service as well as the greatest Burgers and Oxtail fries in town."}
{"text":"Has become one of my favorite burger places, very original an high quality. I defiantly recommend  this place, to bad I live in a different state, so I can't go very often : ("}
{"text":"Slightly pricey, but worth it.  Bachi burger blends a unique fusion of Hawaiian, American, and Japanese flavors into gourmet burgers and other dishes. Their food is fresh, delicious, and unlike any burger you've ever tasted. Too expensive to be a regular stop, but good enough to be an occasional treat, even though they are on the other side of town from me."}
{"text":"Blundered onto this place as I had a business meeting nearby and my GF wanted a burger.  It was a nice surprise...had a 20 min wait on a Friday around 2pm...so I knew the food must be good.  It was!  Oxtail chili cheese fries were a little sweet but the portion was large and the quality of the chili and fries was excellent.  Had the Kiki burger and the Black and Green...both great choices and satisfying.  Service was top notch and friendly.  Hard to go wrong with Bachi Burger...Wahlburgers better step up their game when they come to town with places like this to compete with. :-)"}
{"text":"Good burgers, great service and pretty good happy hour specials. 

The ronin burger was good, it had a sweet sauce on it, almost teriyaki like but I actually preferred my fiancé's Kiki burger. Yum! I'll have to order that next time. We paired our burgers with truffle fries and sweet potato fries for the table. My fiancé absolutely loved the truffle fries and I absolutely loved the perfectly fried sweet potato fries. Oh and then the limitless beers were a good compliment as well. The happy hour special was limitless draft beer for $15.  

I'll have to go back and try another burger off their menu. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Service is a 1-2 star.  Items on menu not served anymore, made to order from bar tender and he took 15 mins to take my order.  After order take, 30 mins before order ready to get out (to go).  Not offered anything to wait/drink.
Let me be clear, good food, but the service hurts"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, Matthew, has been hyping this place up since I moved to Vegas a year & a half ago. And maybe that's why I was so disappointed with how my meal turned out...... and then again maybe not. This place was downright awful. And by awful, I mean I can't believe I paid for my food. 

For so long I believed that presentation was everything, and then I started eating at places like Bachi Burger. Though artfully crafted, all three items I ordered were beyond bland and expensive to say the least. After doing some Yelp picture stalking, I ordered the Oxtail Chili Fries and Pork Belly Buns and requested that both be served as entrees instead of appetizers as Matthew and I like to have all our food at the same time so we can have a variety of items to munch on. My Oxtail Fries came out long before anything else, which was an annoyance, but nothing I was gonna raise a stink about so we proceeded to dig in. 

My sweet Buddah were those fries disgusting. When I'm dining at a place that's charging $11 for a plate of chili fries, I'm expecting quality ingredients and exceptional flavor, and these fries lacked both. If I hadn't known any better (and I guess in some way I don't) I could swear they were covered in a can of Bush's Beans... and nothing else. Not even the fried egg that topped it could add any flavor to this disaster of a dish.

The Oxtail Fries were followed by my Pork Buns and Matthew's Miyagi San Burger that he requested to come out medium. Brown meat through and through is not \"medium,\" people. Yet despite the obviously overcooked hunk of beef, we tried our best to power through the rest of the meal, and let me tell you, it was rough. The grease from the onion rings on the burger was enough to give you a stomach ache and the \"Buns\" around my pork belly where gummy... literally.. it was like eating thick gummy candies with cold pork....

I asked our waitress what condiments they offered so that we might at least get something into our system. Matthew inquired about a sweeter dipping sauce, and she proceeded to tell us they had a pineapple ketchup. I don't care much for sweet things, so I asked what other condiments they had, and finally decided on a garlic chili aioli. Our waitress brought both dipping sauces to us, which I thought was a very kind gesture considering we only wanted the aioli... until she charged us for both of them! 

First of all, if you are going to charge people for condiments at a RESTAURANT.. you need to tell the customer that there's an extra charge. Second of all, don't bring out a condiment that I didn't ask for and then charge me for it.

Matthew and I left all our food on the table and left. We won't be back."}
{"text":"food great once again...
but...35 minutes for a burger. .too damn slow
half therestaurant empty tables
kitchen help should be replaced...
i'm just sayin!###"}
{"text":"Prompt service. Please just get the TVs to work. That's kinda a biggie. Gluten free buns would also be a great idea."}
{"text":"I got so sick off of this food.  I will never eat there again.  I have never been so sick in my life.
My husband and I eat out a lot.  I got really bad food poisoning.  dont know if something was bad or if the pork in the burger was not fully cooked.  

Be Careful Pork must be cooked all the way if not one may develop trichinosis. (look it up)"}
{"text":"I'd def go back to eat their bachi fish burger. It was great and so tasty. Lightly grilled juicy fish was Japanese seasonings. 
We also got the veggie burger which was ok. It was good for a veggie burger. It was different and had a little Indian type taste. Were pescatarians so ...
I would get the truffle fries again as well."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating at Holsteins again a few weeks ago.  However, they didn't have any reservations on OpenTable and my bestie who is a local has been saying how yummy Bachi Burger is.  And, after all, if you can get off the Strip, it's usually better.  I love fusiony burgers so I knew I'd like Bachi Burger.  

It was a tough decision, but I finally decided on the Kalbi Burger.  He and I got the truffle fries to share.  My friend got the regular fries & both she and bf got the Miso Burger.  The wait for food was long, but worth it.  The burgers were huge and juicy.  Mine was cooked perfectly medium.  The sweet and savory sauce complimented the salty & semi spicy kimchee.  The truffle fries had a hint of truffles, however, while bf liked the gravy it was topped with I didn't.  Everyone enjoyed their burgers & my friend loved the refreshingly sweet pineapple ketchup that was served with her fries.  Prices are reasonable and the menu is eclectic and enticing.   Bachi Burger gets busy and I think the service can be a little more attentive (we were waiting awhile after we were done for the bill) but the food is so delish!  Though Bachi Burger is a ways from the Strip, I would say that Holsteins has serious competition from the restaurant for yummiest burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Bachi plenty of times before however it was our first time in this location. Came here at 5.30pm on a weekday- we were hungry and it was quiet, so we thought we would have a great experience. 

We ordered fries and two speciality burgers. The fries came and we didn't have any utensils or napkins until the main food which was kind of annoying because we had to ask for it.

The Spicy Miso burger did not come with peppers like it was supposed to nor the aioli sauce that we ordered extra on the side. When we told the server, he came back to apologize and said that the kitchen was \"out\" but \"they are cooking them right now.\" Fair enough. So we waited and the server brought WHOLE peppers to the table which SHOULD have been cut up inside the burger anyway, like it is on the menu. So we had to cut them up ourselves. 

By far the worst experience we have ever had at Bachi. Service was horrible. Really disappointed as we work in the industry and were really looking forward to this date night on our day off. I was really upset when I left this place."}
{"text":"I've come to this place several times now and I must say, I've been satisfied everytime.

I'd like to think of myself as an old-fashioned burger guy or purist, meaning I like to let the burger, cheese, and ketchup do the talking.  I'm fine with lettuce, tomato, fried onions, and at times, mushrooms and bacon.  I think having too much condiments and toppings ruins or hides the real flavor of the meat and cheese.


Having said that, I didn't think I would like this place too much as other burger fusion places I have tried before were just ok, but was open to trying Bachi burger out.  I have tried several of their burgers and I must say, all are good, though I have my favorites.  My favorite is the kiki burger.  I think most of their burgers at this restaurant tend to be on the sweet side.  Initially, I didn't like this burger much because of the sweetness, but when I put the aioli sauce on it, everything just came together.   The salty taste that I like came from the aioli sauce and just brought the flavoring and ingredients all together.  This burger is what I would recommend for everyone to try first.  It is not too far off the classic ingredients of a burger, I think.  Note, I'm not going to describe the burger toppings too much, as there are better reviewers before me that have described the specifics.  You can also look up the menu at bachi burgers' website 

The second burger on my list is the banh mi burger, which has a Vietnamese flare.  Again, their sauce just brings their fusion idea all together.  Yum Yum.  I would definitely pick this if I'm not up for the kiki burger that day.

The other burgers I've tried are the Kalbi burger and Mr. Ho's burger.  These burgers are fine.  All in all, I think it just depends on what kind of fusion burger you are in the mood for during that time.  If you are wanting something with a little Vietnamese taste, go with the Banh mi burger.  If you want a hint of Korean, go with the Kalbi burger.  

Others in my party have tried the American Wagyu burger and the Ronin burger.  They liked these as well. The buns on these burgers are soft and really good.  Also, I have tried the steamed sandwiches, such as the duck and pork belly sandwiches.  These are great.

Their sausage appetizers are pretty good.  We order this for our little one all the time.  Their fries are awesome too, especially the truffle fries.   

This place definitely has a good vibe and the waiters/waitresses are friendly.  It does get busy at times, so you may want to get their by 1130 for lunch or arrive on earlier dinner times (6??).  

Whenever I have guests from out of town and are in the mood for burgers, I definitely recommend this place.  I do give them a heads up it takes a little while for the burgers to cook, so their expectations for a little wait are set.  The good thing is that they have TVs that you can watch while you wait, if you're not chatting with your friends.  It's always tuned to the cooking or food channel, so there's a chance you will get hungrier, while you wait.  It makes the food even better when it arrives and you take your first bites.  So far, I think everyone leaves satisfied and happy like I am."}
{"text":"The food here was very good. The prices were high ($15 for a burger and that doesn't even come with fries! Really?) and we had a bit of a service issue, but overall it was good.

We ordered the oxtail chili fries. They were good but not much better than basic chili fries you could get anywhere else. We also got the pickled veggies, which were good if you like that sort of thing. I thought they were delicious, especially the garlic, but the waitress said many people don't like it.

The burgers were the best thing. I got the Miyagi San and the wife had the spicy miso. Both were great. We also tried the vanilla honey orange shake and it was good. My only issue with the food, as I said before, was the price. It's about 25% more than it should be considering the portions.

The service was also flawed. Our server started out nice but didn't seem knowledgable. Then after we finished our food we waited over twenty minutes to even be acknowledged! We had to ask another waitress for a box. Then since we wanted a milkshake for desert it was like they got confused about who our server was supposed to be. They were nice but someone should have noticed us waiting that long.

So anyway, this place is worth a try. I would go back again if I got a discount or coupon, but I can't see being a regular."}
{"text":"Oh man. If I could import one restaurant from Las Vegas to Denver, I'd have a hard time deciding between this and Osi's Kitchen. Apples and oranges, I know, but this was one of the best damn burgers I've had...ever. 

First off, the entire menu looks amazing. Every single burger. Every single everything. After seriously analyzing every menu item, I eventually figured I couldn't go wrong with any of them, and opted for the Kalbi. Holy flavor bomb...seriously amazing. The bun was perfectly toasty, the sauce was so flavorful, the patty was perfectly cooked, and the texture and flavor combo was spot on. 

I visit Las Vegas annually for business, and I will ABSOLUTELY make a point to come back next time I'm in town so I can try something else. But...um...maybe they could open a Denver location? For me? Please? Franchise, maybe? PLEASE?!?!?"}
{"text":"I felt like the burger was missing something, I also think although the burgers were really good, they are a bit overpriced... (usually price doesn't bother me) but I almost felt like it wasn't worth it. Employees were awesome though"}
{"text":"No problems with service here. Our server, Dan, was super friendly and worked quickly to get us everything we needed. 

The wait was about 30 minutes. There were quite a few empty tables, so it seems like the wait comes mostly from lack of staff to serve all the tables, not necessarily from quantity of people.

Food was delicious. We had the truffle parmesan fries, Kiki's burger, and the Ronin burger. Kiki's burger was angus beef, shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, caraamelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. The taste wasn't as mushroom-y as I expected, was was nice. And since I love sweet and salty, the marmalade really made the burger. Ronin was angus beef, caramelized onion, japanese cole slaw, fried egg, and yuzu citrus aioli. Also, very good."}
{"text":"Came here 5/10/13, and I don't remember exactly what it was called, but it was the turkey/chicken burger with onion rings, lettuce, tomato, and some teriyaki type glaze on the patty. It came with a mint tasting aioli on the side. The most juicy, flavorful turkey burger I have ever tasted. It did NOT disappoint me at all. I also tried the truffle fries w/ the sundried tomato ketchup thing on the side and that's when I reached food nirvana. I'm definitely coming back here when I come back to the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Just ate there. Wow!! The food was absolutely amazing. Glad we were able to choose between ramen or burgers. I had ramen and the husband had a burger. We also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries. It was delicious. We also had the bacon fried  rice which was soooo good! I loved everything we had here. The service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Is it? Is it the best burger in Las Vegas? On the strip, you are definitely not going to find the best burger in Las Vegas. Trust me. I tried looking -- this means I spent a lot of cash paying for subpar burgers. Luckily, just before you hit Vegas on the 15, exiting East Windmill Lane, you have Bachi Burger. The Asian inspired burger joint was showcased on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives, and I immediately made plans for a Vegas trip -- I made it my first stop.

We started things off with the oxtail chili cheese fries. Most times, chili cheese fries or poutine has fries that are left soggy from the sauce. I liked how the fries were still intact and crisp. The ox tail was tender and was almost chili like -- cooking for hours helped make it into a mush of things. The garlic aioli and fried egg made everything so creamy and smooth. I liked the edition of the cilantro. It gave the dish such a freshness and helped with the richness of the oxtail. With the help of the jalapenos which were quite spicy, the dish was complete.

Though the oxtail fries were good, we all came here for the burger. Morse specifically, I came here for the Ronin burger. This burger had angus beef, caramelized onions, jalapenos, coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I know that seems like a lot of ingredients, but all of the flavors worked. I am a firm believer that a good burger has to have gooey melted cheese or a strong cheese presence -- cheese is always a must. I was surprised that this Asian inspired burger, with no cheese was so delicious. The beef patty was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice crust and pink in the middle. The spicy jalapenos and the sweet bbq and citric aioli all bounced around and filled my mouth with flavor. If you were to get one burger at Bachi, this is the one to get.

Not feeling like another burger, we decided on the pork belly steamed buns. Filled with an irresistable duroc pork belly, the meat was cut thick. The skin and fat on the pork melted in your mouth and created such an unctuous flavor. The boiled egg added more richness to the steam bun. The cilantro, scallions, and radish helped balance the rich fatty pork belly. Interestingly, the chinese black vinegarrete and hoisin bbq sauce gave the salty and sweet flavor of the mini sandwich.

As a dessert, and to send us off in a proper manner, we ordered the malasadas. To me, the Portuguese fried donut balls were out of place. To go along with the Asian style burgers, they should have an Asian style dessert. To me, the fried donut balls were a bit stale and not \"melt in your mouth\" enough. With the help of the delicious coffee gelato though, the dessert was passable. I wouldn't have minded if it were just the coffee gelato by itself.

Bachi Burger is a Las Vegas pit stop for sure. Next time, I will have to give the decadent Shogun Burger a try. That one has foie gras and is $25. Though not on the strip, it is a perfect spot to eat for lunch on the way in or on the way out of Las Vegas. Even if you want to kind of step away from the busy strip, it's not far of a drive to go to Bachi Burger. The inside has all tables and no booths. You just find a seat, grab a beer, maybe a nice sake to compliment your burger, and have an awesome meal.

For those who are in Los Angeles, well, Bachi Burger is coming! It will be in West LA, on Sawtelle. Not quite sure when it will open, but I will keep an eye out for you."}
{"text":"We love it.  The place&staff are friendly and clean.  The burgers, fries, and drinks are OUTSTANDING!  I'm speechless....2b continued"}
{"text":"oMG!!!  Great burgers!! I had the Manga Burger med. rare and the beef was so soft with great flavors. This burger might be the best burger I've had so far.    Service was good but expect a wait...the system they are applying to seat ppl will is weird cuz there would be empty seating but it would not get filled when another table leaves. I guess it's to keep the order load to a certain level. The steam bun sliders are very good, but I prefer the pork ones. The oxtail fries I thought was okay....chili seems to over power the oxtail so it wouldn't have matter if oxtail was in there or not. I would prefer the mushroom truffle fries and those are Delicious. A must for me when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The burgers were good and the price complimented the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in Vegas. And that's saying a lot. We have some of the best burger places in the world here, but this is my favorite. Taste is incredible and the quality is excellent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. The waiter, Marquis, was spectacular. The food he recommended was delicious. I give it 5 stars because it deserves it. My whole family went together and we ate together at a nice table where we could talk and hear each other.  We loved the atmosphere and decor too."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had here in Vegas! Some might say it is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for! It was the juiciest burger I've ever sunk my teeth into!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food....BUT, we had a 20min wait to get seated and then it took 10min before I got up from my seat to walk over and talk to a hostess. We didn't have anyone visit our table or take our drink order until then. Got our burgers in fair time, but it took 30min before we got our Ramen."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers here, I first heard about Bachi Burger while watching the Food Network.  The burgers that they highlighted on that episode were nothing short of remarkable in terms of their creativity and I could practically see the flavors jumping out of the screen and performing kabuki theater on my tasebuds.  

Two of my favorite things - Asian Food and Burgers - combined into the same meal?  Sign me up!!

So, it practically goes without saying that my next trip through Vegas contained \"Bachi Burger\" at the top of my TO-DO list.

And I wasn't disappointed.  This place is incredible!  I've been here twice now and though I still have several of their burgers yet to try, my personal favorite has been the Kalbi Burger with Kimchee and the pork-belly steam buns.  Seriously some of the most flavorful creations I have ever encountered.  My friends had the Miagi San and the Black and Green Burgers and everyone was no less than amazed.

The creators of Bachi Burger have created a winner here.  I hope that their success continues so that I won't have to go all of the way to Vegas anytime that I want one of these Zen burgers.  Of course, for the time being, I'm more than willing - because they're worth it!"}
{"text":"So one of my friends invites a bunch of us to this new burger place that he discovered recently.  Says he and his girlfriend love the food here, and would love to go here as a group.  The burger place in question is none other than Bachi Burger, which appeared to take quite the beating when it came to service.  It had been a while since the place opened, so I figured any kinks in service would be ironed out by now.

Stopped by here tonight and I can safely say that there were no issues with the service.  Drinks were kept full, we were checked on regularly, servers brought extra silverware in case we all wanted to share a dessert etc.  No complaints there.  

The reason this place is getting three stars from me is that they seem to pile toppings onto burgers without know when to quit!  I got myself a Ronin burger, and it seemed that the Japanese cole slaw and katsu sauce were both fighting over who gets to my tastebuds first.  Yes, there were carmelized onions, miso dressing, and an egg on the burger, yet all these flavors were overpowered by the cole slaw and katsu.  Even the beef was overpowered by them; they also didn't ask how I wanted my beef cooked.  It was done medium well, while I prefer medium to keep some pink and juicyness in the middle of the patty.

I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee; it wasn't as good as I've had at other restaurants.  The coffee is served and is still being strained when it is brought to your table.  It came out dark and had a strong aroma, which set my expectations high.  Sadly, the coffee wasn't that strong and ended up being overpowered by the milk.

All in all Bachi Burger is alright, and I'd probably stop by every once in a while if I lived nearby.  As is, with me living in the southwest, I doubt I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Had the Kiki burger. It was pretty good, but not enough for me to fall in love... but keep in mind I'm comparing the countless burgers I've tasted...and I'm picky.

Maybe a different burger next time?

 I think bachi burger is a bit overhyped. But it was still good and our waiter was sweet."}
{"text":"The oxtail fries are amazing! It is a must eat!!! We also tried the kalbi burger and bison burger. The kalbi burger is perfect with the housemade kimchi. Amazing! The bison burger was very rich. A little heavy for me, but still really tasty.

Service was fantastic. This place is a MUST GO!"}
{"text":"It is a long wait but truly worth it. Everything was flavorful and delicious. Just what my tastebuds needed. The oxtail chilli fries were great. A must try."}
{"text":"Well today will be a Yelp first for me because I will be giving my first 5.

This place was awesome. After spending $100 on the overly hyped Wicked spoon the night before, this place was a breath of fresh air. The food was excellent. Asian fusion at its best with fresh ingredients and originality. The staff was friendly. The place was clean. I spent around $60.00 for both me and my wife without any regret. I highly recommend this place. The hype for this place was justified. 

Customer service: 5

{"text":"I truly enjoyed Bachi burger. I got a spicy miso burger with a wagyu beef patty and it was juicy and delicious. 

I also got an order of the Parmesan truffle fries and I thought they were just ok. 

My server was very friendly and I would recommend checking this place out if you want a fancy hamburger!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! 

I absolutely love a hearty bowl of ramen especially after a night of drinking.. With that being said, I woke up Saturday morning from a night full of clubbing/drinking to a monstrous hangover! I woke my boyfriend up and said, \"we need to get ramen RIGHT NOW.\" Thankfully, a group of friends of ours recommended Bachi Burger and I'm soo glad they did! At first I was a little hesitant considering the restaurant is called \"Bachi Burger\" though we were coming for the ramen, but it definitely did not disappoint! For those staying on the strip, this location was roughly 6 miles away and was about a 15 minute drive. We arrived a little after noon and waited about 15 minutes for a table. Dillon, our server, was attentive, polite, and patient - while I indecisively decided on what kind of ramen to order. I decided on the spicy miso ramen based on the numerous yelp pictures/reviews but was a bit nervous due to the amount of spice (sensitive stomach + night of drinking = possible regrets). Safe to say, it was the perfect kick to get me through the day. The spicy miso wasn't too spicy, in fact it was a little sweet. I also asked for softer noodles and they definitely delivered. I was a little disappointed because the ramen had 1 pork belly meat and not as much garnishes as I'm used to :( Aside from that, the meal was great! Perfect spice, generous portions, customizable textured noodles, and oily/rich flavors! I wasn't able to finish the entire bowl and took it to-go. I ate it 2 hours later and it was just as great!! Too bad we don't have a Bachi Burger in California :("}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this location. The menu has a variety of options and they also a have full bar, which is different than all the other locations. My usual favorites are the truffle fries and the miyagi san wagyu burger. (You can never go wrong with the truffle fries!) My usual server paul is always nice and friendly, as well as the servers named andy and roger. I will definitely will come back here! :)"}
{"text":"Went there sometime before Memorial weekend with some friends. There was probably about 6 of us and I got the Kiki burge r and sweet potatoe fries. We probably waited an hour before our food came out. The burger was good, the waiting part of it...NO BUENO!!...The guy comes out and asks how things are, one of they guys at my table ask how long it takes to make one of these burgers. Dude says about 12 minutes...12 minutes?....and it took you guys an hour to bring the food out?..what is it a one burner grill in the back or something??...besides the wait.. the burgers are good, small, but good."}
{"text":"Me, my sis, my bf and a friend decided to go try this location out. Got seated in minutes. Took a bit long for the food to come. I ordered a ronin burger, medium rare, well just my luck my burger comes out raw. I give a little piece to my bf n his son I did eat some of it. Told the waiter and the manager came n talked to me n he took 2 bucks off the bill..lol..and brought us some donuts and a small scoop of coffee ice cream. As I spooned some to my friend, she noticed something hanging that looked like coconut, so we thought, well to our surprise, it was a piece of tissue or could be part of the paper from a straw that was in the ice cream. We all were like wtf!!.couldnt believe it happened twice...def won't be going back to that location."}
{"text":"This place is burger shop meets Asian flair. The burgers are excellent with higher end ingredients, like gruyere cheese and shiitake mushrooms. The truffle fries are great, enough for sharing with someone. The prices aren't bad for this classier style food, and the service was very good."}
{"text":"1st complaint- Completely overpriced.  $12 burgers with no side and a $10 beer!

2nd complaint- Burgers were eh. Asked for medium, got practically rare. Flavorless. N-N-Out makes a better burger for a fraction of the cost.

3rd Complaint- I'm in my 30's and I don't love loud music but I don't mind it and it's not something I would usually complain about but when techno trance music is playing so loud on a Monday afternoon that you can't even have a conversation with your own party... it's too loud. 

Last and BIGGEST complaint- I'm still in shock by this... I ordered iced green tea.  I took one drink, it was horrible. Tried to pass it along to my friends but everyone thought it was horrible. I told the waitress she could take it because I didn't like it.  Her very first response was \"Well did you already drink out of it?\"  What??!!  Are you kidding me?!  What was she gonna do, give it to someone else?  My natural response to her was \"of course, that's how I know I don't like it!\"   Her next response shocked me more than the first... I kid you not, she said \"Hmmmm, I'll have to find out about this\"   HMMMM????  
I almost walked out then.  She came back several minutes later to let me know her manager would take it off the bill this time.  If I would have drank half the tea, I'd understand but there were 3 drinks taken out of it.  Worst manager ever! 

Waitress was all around horrible btw.  The whole experience was horrible.

$70 for 3 people. 3 burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 beer."}

{"text":"Service: 3
Food: after having it the first time I rated it a 5. Now after the second time it's 3.5-4 

We came here on a sat night knowing there will be a wait. We put our names down and was told that for a party of 5 it's going to be 30-45 min wait. Exactly 30 mins later we checked back in and it seems like they have already crossed our names out (we weren't waiting outside of the restaurant we walked around).  We were told that unfortunately they would have to rewrite our names on the bottom of their list again since we left the area. I personally have never heard of that rule or ever been to any restaurant that practices that so I tried reasoning with the hostess. Long story short turns out that they could \"make something happen\" and that there's another party just leaving and we will get seated right after. Our waitress was really nice and did a good job at recommending different menu items but she didn't check back in with us very often to see how things are going and if we needed anything. 

I remembered the burgers being amazing the first time I tried them. However this time not so much, my burger tasted a lot more saltier than I remembered and to my liking. We got the truffle fries and a side of pineapple ketchup. I mean I LOVE pineapple so I just HAD to try it. It taste just like ketchup that's a little on the sweeter side but other than that I don't taste anything different. I'm guessing it's just ketchup mixed with pineapple juice but who knows! I got the \"banh mi\" burger and the bf got the Ronin Burger. Banh mi burger...like I mentioned was pretty salty, but I think that might be because the pickled carrot was not made correctly. I tasted the carrot on its own and it was extreme salty and nasty so I had to take it out of my burger. Other than that little hiccup..everything was wonderful. The bf loved his burger I mean you can't go wrong with a juicy patty and fried egg! OH did I mention their flavored soda is ammmaazzingggg! I've tried the apple lychee, the peach one, as well as orange tangerine and every single one is great!  

Overall experience was great. Def will be back again."}
{"text":"A new twist w the Burger! I had mine w a fried egg and loved the garlic fries! My friends ordered everything off the menu and we all family styled it. 

Lots of options to choose from and wanting to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Great way to end a Vegas trip, limited selection for Vegetarians, but they have a delicious Veggie Burger, that is SO HUGE. I could barely finish half. 

My friends started their meal with the oxtail fries & I have never seen such a happy trio! They devoured the fries. 

The veggie burger flavors were fantastic! The actual patty tasted fresh and one of the best I've had.  It wasn't too dry, and the flavors were a great mix! There were bits of red bean & walnuts tucked inside the patty as well.  The patty was paired with fried eggplant, fried tofu, fresh greens and lemon aioli. The bun itself was so fluffy & light!"}
{"text":"This place/chain is slipping.  It used to be one of my favorite burger places off the strip, and I happily recommended it to family and friends, but somehow the service and food quality seem to be in decline since I first tried it two year ago.

Liked: pork belly steamed buns, Ronin burger, Kiki Burger, Miso Burger, and Miyagi San, the size of the burgers and how much you get when you order fries or oxtail fries

Disliked: how long it takes to get your food, how long it takes to get your order in, banh-mi burger, signature blend burgers

Hopefully they figure out how to recapture the magic of my initial visit.  I've been back several times since, and each time I find myself having to forgive little things or make excuses."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a date last 5/31/2014 night at the Windmill location. It took 20 minutes to get our burgers and the veggie gyoza and fries never came. When we got our burgers, I asked them to please get our appetizer (which is supposed to come before the meal) and our order of fries. Not only was it late, but it turned out neither were ever prepared. I told our server, I think her name was Ashley, to cancel the veggie gyoza appetizer, and she rushed to the kitchen I assume to communicate it to the cook. 5 minutes later, someone from the kitchen came out with them wrapped in a to-go box. I had to repeat that I already cancelled that order. (Another communication breakdown or  one that didn't happen?) At this point I was exasperated. My husband who had already finished his burger, was still waiting for his fries (dessert?). I asked him if he still wanted it after a server said: \"two minutes.\" He looked so disgusted that I just asked them to cancel the order. The manager came out with repeated empty apologies, but didn't offer to make it right. If you're a manager and you want your patrons to come back, shouldn't you try to make it right???!!! Instead of offering to comp one of our drinks, she continued to repeat her apologies. THESE EMPTY and REPEATED APOLOGIES irritated me. I'm from Hawaii and so are the owners. There is something called customer service, but I expected more of a Kama'aina service here. People are human and mistakes are made, but make it right. Their mistake in our order irritated me, but it happens. HOWEVER, their failure to make it right is downright disgusting and offending."}
{"text":"Bacon isn't a vegetable, right? 

After mentioning \"the girl I'm with doesn't eat meat,\" I ordered \"sautéed brussel sprouts\" for an appetizer. Two bites in she realized she'd eaten pork... for the first time in 10 years. 

The waitress made a slight apology, but didn't care enough to take it off the bill. Adding to that how long it took to take our order, it didn't leave a good impression.

The food was \"okay,\" about what you'd expect from a $15 - $30 burger, but as most recent reviews mention, the service ain't great. There are better burger joints out here. Holstein's, just off the top of my head."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had. My mouth is watering just thinking about the Ronin burger. Caramelized onions, miso, coleslaw, fried egg, yuzu citrus aioli. And a perfectly cooked (medium rare) burger. All of it on a perfect bun. Service was friendly and efficient, and we went back for a second round the following night."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. The pineapple ketchup and fries were awesome, so was the truffle fries."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I found it to be pricey for the quality of food. The services was great."}
{"text":"Not completely sold. I saw this place on the Foodnetwork and thought it looked really good. i had driven past it a few times and just never made it in until now. 
I came on a Thursday night and it was not too crowded and we were able to sit at the bar with really no wait time. We started with beer which was actually well priced and ordered 2 burgers and an order of sweet potato fries. We had the Kiki burger and the Mr. Ho burger. the fries were actually amazing and the sauce perfectly suited. The burgers however were not great, nor even really all that good. They were immensely salty and the mish mash of flavors did not work right together, they sounded good on paper but they lacked finesse and were really just redolent of salt not flavor. The burgers were cooked perfectly though and that is a plus.
I really wanted to like this place and it really started to fill up as we left but there are certainly better options in Vegas where you can skip this place and hit the next gourmet burger shop. You won't miss anything by not coming here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've never had a bad experience. The most recent visit, there was a bit of a wait. I asked the hostess if we can sit at the bar since we were starved. She said that unfortunately that we couldn't because they were on break. Immediately afterwards, the bartender asks if we'd like to sit down I told her what the hostess said and she told us to take a seat and that she'd take care of us. Awesome. 

As for the food, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries are a must have. EVERY. SINGLE. VISIT. All those flavors together coupled with the tenderness of the oxtail! Mmmhmmm! You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers. I've had the Kalbi Burger, Ronin Burger, Mr. Ho's Burger and the Banh Mi Burger. 

The Banh Mi Burger was definitely interesting. I love Banh Mi whenever I eat Pho but I didn't quite know what to expect from the burger. It wasn't bad by any means but I wouldn't order it again especially over the other options. 

I definitely would give this place a try...or two or three."}
{"text":"Great food.. Came in with 10 people.. Everyone tried a speciality burger.. I had the Shogun. It was a Waygu and foie gras burger with unagi. Pork belly sliders, ahi tuna burger, Mr. Ho burger, a bunch more that I cannot think of.. But you will not go wrong. Come with a open mind and try something you'll normally grub on and rest assured your tummy will be happy! Don't forget to get the Oxtail chili cheese fries!!"}
{"text":"Quality is on point. Everything is a little too sweet from all of the sauces and even my burger. I know it's special so I will come back for a different burger in hopes I will find my favorite. Truffle fries were ok. I've had better. Fried chicken nothing to write home about. They took over the ramen shop next door so maybe that's a future option."}
{"text":"Beat burger in town and super desert as well. I come here with my husband almost every week and still didn't get enough of it. Kiki burger is my favorite and the Portuguese donuts are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers - loved it. Meat is so moist and delicious. Off the strip but I think it's worth it. Definitely would recommend this place. 

No reservations - came at lunch time and had to wait 40min 

Oxtail fries is a must"}
{"text":"Heard about it on triple D, and it definitely lived up to the hype.  The oxtail fries are super original and tasty.  The duck was cooked perfectly.   If you go to Vegas, this place is a little out of the way, but well worth the detour."}
{"text":"This is a great place for burger and fries.  Kalbi Burger is delicious.  Great flavor.  The sweet potato fries are awesome and so are the truffle fries.  The service however is slow and average at best.  If you have time, this place is great.  If you are looking for quick, then pick again.  I will definitely be back but you have to be patient."}
{"text":"used to love this place. but the last time we visited before watching a movie, our food took an hour to come! and instead of apologizing, the manager rambled on and argued that it has only been less than 15 minutes. we were there at 5:15, order (main course) didn't come til 6:30! we had to rush and eat and argue with a stupid manager and try to catch a movie at 6:50! good food,  our chicken had some kind of fabric strand in it though, but really bad management or should i say, manager!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place because of the Triple D show...and of course, it was just as I had hoped. The burger was delish....I had the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. Yum! I took the Pork Belly Steamed Buns to go...amazing even as leftovers the food was good. I'm definitely going back and recommending it for others to try. 

I heard others have had to wait, but I went early for lunch and that was perfect because I walked right in and got a seat. The place did fill up by noon...so go for an early lunch or after the rush at noon. Service was great early on because I got my food quick and there was no wait for a table."}
{"text":"great tender burgers that just melt in your mouth! different types of fries, & all good! my personal fave are the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"So happy to have finally tried the food here.  Every experience I've had at Bachi Burger has always been excellent - the food, the service.  I wish I could try everything on the menu, but I tend to stick to the ones I've liked from the get go (Mr. Ho's burger, parmesan fries, oxtail chili cheese fries).  One thing more memorable than the taste of the food is the fact that I can never finish every thing... portions are on point!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried the BBQ burger and truffle fries. The fries were AMAZING! the burger was great and the bun was perfect. Took it to go and it didn't even get soggy."}
{"text":"Certainly among the best burgers in Vegas.  As long as you're not looking to spend thousands of dollars on a burger with gold flakes in it, you'll be impressed with this place.  If you think In-N-Out is the shit, this will be wasted on you."}
{"text":"Oh man Oh man! A trip to Vegas would not be complete without a detour to Bachi Burger.  The Ox Tail fries are on point and the Bahn Mi Burger is deeeelish. Saw this place on Diners, Drive In's and Dives and was not disappointed.  The service was excellent and the wait time wasn't too bad.  By far one of my most favorite dining experiences to date."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and ramen. Miyagi-san burger was an excellent choice. Oxtail fries as an appetizer and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"service issues have been accounted for and fixed. I have been twice recently, and the food is still the BOMB! The Bahn Mi burger is probably my favorite and this is a go-to burger spot for me! Lucky for me it's close to my house and half way to the airport. Great spot to catch a bite before you get to McCarran."}
{"text":"Great food. Absolutely shit service. If you come in and order a To-Go about 8 people walk by and look at you like you're and inconvenience. The food is the only aspect of Bachi and Shoyu Ramen keeping it afloat. Only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the guy who finally helped was awesome and made up for it..."}
{"text":"Called this place from 3 minutes down the street and was told no wait list. Walked in and 15 min wait. Waited the 15 minutes and got seated and waited another 8 minutes to get drink and food order. Was told the server would come. Server never came. We went to get up and a server told us to have a nice night. I guess no one wanted to serve us. Won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Terrible service again... Overpriced average food. Uninterested staff... This was my last time here..."}
{"text":"Okay 1 word sums up my whole expirience here. YUM! 

The bun on the burger tho! It melted in my mouf! The burger its self was a PARTY in my mouf! And their fries with the jallepeno slices on it YUM! 
(I just drooled on my laptop) lol"}
{"text":"I was really excited to stop by and check out batchi burger. After a long night drinking I was craving something substantial.  Unfortunately for me batchi bueger didnt live up to the hype.

The staff was really nice and accommodating.  I appreciated our servers input and attentiveness.  We started off with the pork belly steamed buns. I enjoyed them they were something out of the ordinary and I dont usuall like pork belly. I would recommend you try them especially if you like pork belly.

I also ordered the truffle parmesean fries and the mr miyagi burger. The fries were just ok for me they were cooked well. I enjoyed the parmesan but I really didnt care for the brown sauce I believe it was a truffle sauce. The mr miyagi burger was just ok for me as well. It had way too many sauces and seasonings. You can tell its quality ingredients I feel there is no need to mask the burger in all that sauce. Even though batchi burger is off of the strip you wouldn't know that by looking at the price of the
Food.

I would still recommend you check out batchi burger, but it was nothing exceptional and I dont plan on comming back."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place out and I'm glad I finally did.  We tried many different items and here is what we thought.

*Calamari - It was really good! I would recommend this dish.

*Edamame - This wasn't something we ordered. We got some free edamame because our food was taking forever. It was nice of them and I enjoyed it!

*Taro milk tea with boba - It was decent, but didn't have enough boba. 

*Vietnamese Coffee -  Delicious, but may be too sweet for some. 

*Truffle Parmesan fries - Yum! Not a fan of their sun dried tomato aioli dipping sauce, but perfect without it.

*Kiki's burger- Slightly sweet due to the sweet onion marmalade, ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly, delicious garlic chili aioli sauce served on the side.

*Bachi Fish- Not what I expected, but very good! Very messy, so ask for extra napkins. 

*Mandarin Orange Tangerine soda - So good! You must try this if you're a citrus fan.

* Trio of assorted ice cream sandwiches:

 Pistachio- This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors, so it's no surprise I liked it.
 Black sesame- Surprisingly delicious! My favorite of the three.
 Maple nut- Not sweet enough. Not as good as I expected.

I would love to go back and try some of their other menu items. So many things sound delicious!"}
{"text":"There burgers are amazing! No, the whole menu is but they took away there \"happy hour\" and there new happy hour is just pitiful and it's a dollar off milkshakes.. Service is okay but with a menu that good it's worth the wait.

Get the Ox Tail fries! Don't forget to add an extra fried egg! 

All there milkshakes are amazing! And worth the wait."}
{"text":"MLML always is looking for a good burger and we heard about Bachi Burger from a co-worker.
Bachi Burger is hidden in a small strip mall and has a touch of an Asian atmosphere.
We ordered the Bachi pickles for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised of the presentation.  Two small oblong trays of different items - cauliflower, beet, cucumber, and other  assorted veggies but the best was the garlic.  It was soaked in some teriyaki sauce or Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce and it tasted sweet not like a garlic at all.  I could have eaten a whole plateful of those.
MLML ordered the Kiki burger which he devoured and i ordered the steamed duck sandwich or a version of the hum bao or manapua.  We were both very satisfied with our meals and the specialty dessert.
The service could have been better - they forgot a salad and seldom filled our drinks.
That was the first time we were there...
I had to bring down the rating to 3 starts because the second time we were there, MLML ordered a burger with blue cheese which was not tasteful at all and I switched to the steam sandwich with the pork belly.  The pork belly had too much fat in it and I had to separate it.  Service was so-so.  Pickles were still great!
I would go back to try the last steam sandwich option with the short rib."}
{"text":"Best burger EVER. Tried the Kiki burger - it was like nothing I've ever had. Ridiculously flavorful. Carmelized onions were amazing. Dipping sauces were unique and equally delicious. I can't believe they only charge $8 for these things! We did have to wait awhile for our burgers (minor mixup) but the wait was totally worth it. Great staff, clean place, nice decor. We will most def be back. And soon!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We started off with the truffle fries, which were fantastic. Finally, a restaurant that does truffle fries right! my husband ordered the spicy miso burger and I ordered the miyagi San burger. Both were very tasty. We definitely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great food but every time I've gone it's a 30min plus wait. I even called once, they said there was no wait at all, got there less than 4 minutes later and there was a 20 minute wait magically."}
{"text":"The food was great! If you have to try anything, try the oxtail chili cheese fries! I went to this place back in 2016 and completely forgot to review them. This will be my go to spot next time I'm in the Sin City."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is my go to place for good hamburger. I hardly eat one but when I do, I'd rather spend a bit more for good quality. It's not your typical American burger joint. They have a variety of asian flavors. It's worth a try!

I'm glad they opened one near my house. If I'm not mistaken this is their third location. I used to drive to Eastern, then they opened in Summerlin now in Russell. The food is consistent and service is not bad."}
{"text":"The Manager Of This Place Needs To Step In The Service Sucks This Was One Of My Favorite Places Not Anymore The Food Quality Looked Good But The Tastes Not So Much No Wonder There Was No One In The Place"}
{"text":"Waitress could have been more knowledgeable with the beers and items they did not have that day. JUST LOOKS BAD ALL AROUND. BUT FOOD IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great job kitchen staff! If the patio was wiped down daily I would be there more often. In windy dusty Vegas I understand, but it really should be done BEFORE opening. It gets very very busy and it's NOT a large place. Off hours I DO suggest! ENJOY, i do! 
I WISH THEY OPENED an hour earlier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't be like everyone else. GRAB that extra hour!"}
{"text":"New twist on the classic burger, skeptical at first but I fell in love. Ronin Burger is great so are the Oxtail fries (I think that's what they are called). Try it out. You'll love it."}
{"text":"This place is on top of it with service. Everyone is on point and food is on point. Probably the best customer service I have seen in years. Although the wait was long, the food and service was well worth it.

BOMB food and great atmosphere!

Hubby and I will go here every time we visit family in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lots of hype around this place, and I can see why.

I came here last night to eat with some friends (ok more than a few...there were like 20 of us), and I was pleasantly surprised. We were all able to be seated, but I don't know how long the rest of the group was waiting to be seated, and I'm not sure if they made prior arrangements or whatever. (I don't know that this is really the best place for large groups though...the restaurant isn't that big). With such a big group, I thought we would be there forever waiting for food and everything. Not so...the staff were very friendly and everything was a lot faster than I thought it would be. I was actually pretty impressed with the speed. The staff were very attentive, and they joked around with us. Also, not once were our water glasses empty, which I really appreciated.

Anyhow, the food (which is why anybody is reading this review anyhow)...
Oxtail chili cheese fries...fantastic! If you've never had oxtail, the meat is really tender and juicy, so it definitely adds a new dimension to chili fries. They also put an egg on it. Also, it's huge so consider sharing it.

I ordered the black and green burger and it was delicious! You can definitely taste the quality meat in it. the combination of ingredients was quite superb. I guess it's a fancy burger, and for a burger it is pricey, but I think it's worth it, at least once in a while. Definitely something unique.

I was quite satisfied, and had a great experience. :)"}
{"text":"Saw Bachi featured on DDD one night and was so happy to find out that it was located less than a mile away from my house in Las Vegas. 

I've tried a few of the burgers. My favorite is the kalbi burger. I love the marinade and the kimchee and spicy mayo they use. I could smell this marinated beef patty from outside. In loooove with the oxtail chili cheese fries! Every time I bring someone here, that's a hit. Went one time and finally got to try the pork belly buns, but unfortunately the pork belly was cold when we got it, kind of congealed already. My family eats a lot of pork belly and being Chinese, I'm familiar with similar dishes. My friend and I were highly disappointed. I love their strawberry jasmine lemonade! So good ESP in the LV heat. Never seen the combo anywhere else. 

They also opened a ramen house next door. You can order from both menus. I'll be back to try the ramen (but probably not until the winter) and to give those pork belly buns another try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were staying on the strip but wanted something for dinner that was specific to the area. We love watching Drive-Ins, Diners and Dives and looked up to see if there were any local places that we were close to. We decided on Bachi Burger and we are SO glad we did. Ratha was our waitress and she absolutely took care of us and helped us decide what to get. We both got the pickled veggies of the day, as well as the oxtail chili fries. We both got different burgers- the Ronin and the Black and Green. I don't even know what to say other than you need to go and eat here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bachi burger on Russell is the place to go if you're hangry. You can take out all your anger on the huge patties and soft bun they serve their Asian fusion deliciousness on. 

Make sure if you are going in with a big group to reserve some seats because the place isn't that big. It seemed they were short staffed in the front. 

The oxtail fries were awesome. I recommend em highly. The kalbi burger was really good too. Kalbi marinated party with Kim chee and lettuce. Every bite was a juicy crunch."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to Yelp and I enjoy reading review and trying out new places. After reading some of their reviews, I think most of their customers are being extremely generous with their reviews.  If you noticed on most of their reviews, you'll see \"Understaffed, Long Wait, Mediocre Food, Etc.\" but the stars are 4 to 5.  

I've been to Bachi Burger four times.  First time, the wait was long (40 min) and they had empty tables.  I ordered the Miso Burger and it was cooked perfectly and delicious, but not worth the wait.

Second visit, another long wait (30 min) and about 40 min wait on our food.  The customers who arrived later than us were served first.  When the waiter realized we didn't get our food and rushed the order.  The waiter even blamed the chef.  If the customer who arrived later didn't order the same burger, I probably would've believed the waiter.  Our burgers came out rare and none of our fries were the right order.  Worst experience on that visit.

Third visit, our friend wanted to try the Miyagi Burger.  Once again, wait was about 30 min for seating.  We observed two open tables.  Long story short, none of us had the right order.  When we got the right order.

We decided to visit the restaurant for the fourth time and give it another chance.  Big mistake...what happened the second visit happened again.  Even though the food is good when properly cooked, the wait and the service isn't worth it."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook I am never disappointed when I go there. Their most popular dish, the oxtail chili cheese fries, really lives up to the hype it's so addictive. I usually get the kiki burger because caramelized bacon, spicy mayo, and gruyere cheese just sounds so amazing. If you're not up for the chili fries and like slightly spicy I recommend there salt and pepper fries which comes with fresh sliced jalapenos tossed in. Unfortunatley I have not had dessert every time I've gone because the burgers are so big and even though you say you won't eat it all you usually do. This place is good all around for food, drink, and your wallet."}
{"text":"on strip prices, should have on strip service! easy enough right? I gave the one star, so I wont have to get into talking about how the service was. \"Angela\" the girl that helped me, was; sorry totally clueless, Learn how many ounces your burgers come in. its not so hard, ask your chef, or your manager, eye ball it im sure you serve it hella times in one day. Ok maybe im being unfair with the one star, but this is my yelp review. 

order:  wagyu burger with  swiss and maple wood beacon with the specification of \"rare\" please, and the black truffle oil french fries.  

25 minutes later my burger comes out looks delicious, The buns looked like they were glazed with love and passed though a line of inspectors for flaws, my cheese is yellow, I didnt know swiss came in cheddar! my burger pattie, very well done. 

I wait patiently for \"Angela\" and as she comes to my table with a distraught look on her face. I calmy explain that I ordered a \"rare\" burger, at this point she doesnt know how to respond to me. I explain myself very respectively, and so while I wait for the awkward silence, she says to me \" well we can fire up another one, But we would have to charge you for it.\"  she saw my expression change even before she finished her last word. (awkward moment)  she grabs my plate and shows the gentleman who looks to be a manager, being kind and  understanding, he asked to have another burger re-fired , at this point, im knawing away at my truffle oil garlic french fries, and they are good, but first off, Ive never met anyone who thought truffle oil had any sort of aromatic value, and I understand this is a fusion restaurant, and Im assuming black truffle oil and wagyu gave them the $$. Well all in all my service was bleh, My burger, even after it was re-fired, bleh, and the $$, I couldve easily gone somewhere else and then go to another. Anyways the likely hood of me going back is slim, But everyone deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Our Canadian cousins LOVE this place and definitely put this place on top of their list to visit. My first time -- and I already want to come back! Excellent burgers. Truffle fries. Oxtail chili fries. Superb!"}
{"text":"An asian-inspired burger spot that we enjoyed very much. However, for me personally, I came for the burger but stayed for the fries. 

I don't eat pork or red meat - I only eat poultry - so I ordered The Lonely Bird which was a ground chicken and turkey burger. My +1 ordered the wagyu burger with avocado, Swiss cheese, and a fried egg added to it. We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries between ourselves and that was by far my favorite dish.

The buns were soft and sweet, the meat well cooked, and the added vegetation was fresh and balanced out my burger. I was only disappointed by how long it took my fries to come out. I like to switch bites between burger and fries but by the time my fries came out, my boyfriend was already finished with his burger and  I was half-way done with my mine and already full. Being quite the gluttonous person, I still ate the fries I was waiting for and it was worth the food baby/coma that came afterwards."}
{"text":"as seen on DDD.. (diners, drive-ins and dives)..came here wanting to come so bad..decided to place our orders to-go..took awhile because it was so damn packed..for such a small place..i ordered the bachi burger..it was good, but it wasnt GREAT. Somethings missing, but i cant complain. On to the oxtail chili cheese fries..i must say, it was delicious, but i only had like two pieces of oxtail meat..but then again i was on one.. french fries topped with chili, oxtail meat, cilantro, and a fried egg."}
{"text":"Great different concept of burgers, salads are very tasty and fresh.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here because of reviews recommendation and when I got here I didn't feel like a burger so I had the pork Ramen which was very good pork belly I would eat here again with friends but I would not drive across town for it."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting for a few days and came across Bachi Burger while out with my husband and son. I had no idea what to expect when we walked in, but I was pretty happy to see the menu had a large selection and even a kid's menu. It was obvious to me as a Hawaii resident that the owner/chef must have been from Hawaii as well based on their menu. I had the customized Wagyu burger and it was delicious! The buns are buttery and a little sweet; I would buy their bread separately if I could. We also had the garlic fries which were okay. It tasted more like parsley than garlic, but my husband loved the garlic aioli sauce it came with. He had the pork bao buns which were cooked to perfect. The buns were steamed perfect and the pork belly just melted in your mouth. I also had the haupia coconut panna cotta which was also perfection. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is definitely kid-friendly, a major plus for our two-year-old son."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Bachi burger, but this was my first visit to Bachi in Vegas. We ordered  a black and green burger and a cobb style salad.

The food came out and the salad didn't really have much ranch dressing on it... so I asked for extra ranch and the waitress told us that was going to be an additional charge of .50. I said OK  and also asked for a side of mayo.

The girl came back with extra ranch and ketchup (not mayo) and my boyfriend remarked that he's never been in a sit-down restaurant that charges extra for dressing or condiments. The waitress looked like a deer in headlights-- she's like \"Do you want me to have the charge removed?\"

\"Yes,\" he said, and she walked away...awestruck that he contested the charge.

The manager came over to ask if everything was ok, and it was. The food was great, the salad was incredible and although our waitress was kind of a bobble-head, it all worked out just fine.

**Let the record show that on their menu it says there's no charge for extra sauce. It says besides for their specialty aoli's (creamy porcini mushroom sauce, pineapple ketchup etc.) all other extra sauces are complimentary."}
{"text":"Ate here way before it showed on Triple D.  The burgers and fries are so unique!"}
{"text":"Its a Asian inspired burger joint!!!  Interesting ingredients made the ronin burger really tasty although I think I would wanna try another burger the next time I go in.  The truffle fries were amazing.  

The ronin burger came with a tablespoon of aioli sauce on the side, obviously not enough for a nice size burger.  I asked for more sauce but was told it was another $.50.  I swear, to my knowlege, aioli sauce is mainly mayonaise.  But whatever the burger was good. 

Service was timely and appropriate.  Im happy I came.  See you soon Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Friends and I met for dinner. Ordered calamari, ronin and kiki burger, sweet potato fries and pork belly buns. 

The calamari was lightly breaded, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Sauces also complemented the dish well. 
Both burgers were cooked how we liked them- well done. They are greatly crafted and an asian fusion perfection. I loved the sweet potato fries especially with the spicy catsup. The buns were good, although it tasked too \"porky\" and too sweet for me. 

Our bill was $60ish without the tip. I thought it was expensive for the size of their serving. Also, I am a fan of a classic cheeseburger, as compared to these...but Bachi was worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! Service is a little slow, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"$53 for 3 burger and 2 fries is a bit much BUT the quality of the ingredients is the culprit. Parmesan fries were a bit limp for us but the flavor was there. Sweet potato fries werent too sweet and just enough salt. The size of the burgers are great and buns are awesome. The yolk in my burger could have sat on grill for another few seconds but it was not overdone which is great. Shredded lettuce was crisp and just the right amount.  I'll be back but the price will detour me from going all the time."}
{"text":"Phenominal. Definately worth the wait. The food is very unique with great flavor. Tried several burger places while in vegas. I will miss this one the most. Try mr ho's burger for a very different experience. Went with a party of 9 and everyone loved it. Our waiter was great. Try this place you will not regret it."}
{"text":"AMAZING. . Unique and Delicious!!! I live in Florida and going to make an annual trip just for this place. Juicy burger even the vegan one is delish"}
{"text":"I love the food at Bachi and I like that you can get the ramen from next door also. However, the service tonight was really bad. I'm not sure why we were rushed on every little thing when the restaurant was half empty and didn't close for over 3 hours. The funny part was the girl would say \"take your time\" right after trying to take something away prematurely and us saying we weren't done with it, and also after the most rushed check drop ever. Um, thanks? Between that and the horrible music choices (2011 called and wants Party Rock by LMFAO back), I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious hamburger :) I got the Ronin burger, and the meat was so juicy. I've never tasted such a burger so delicious. I tried Father's Office in California and I thought that was good, but wow this is super amazing! I have yet to try Umami Burger in California but so far, this is my favorite burger!! Their pork steamed buns are super delicious too!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from the food network, and had to stop by when I was in Las Vegas. I have to say that this place had a lot to live up to, and it was everything and more! My mind was blown! Try their Banh Mi burger or Miyagi burger! You won't be disappointed! Also my brother and I shared the oxtail chili cheese fries, and OMG! This place is awesomeness!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! It seems like all the menu items were very well thought out as all the items we ordered were executed and put together very well. 

Location is clean, organized, and the servers are very attentive.

Truffle fries are DIVINE. Can't wait to come back  so I can pig out again!"}
{"text":"Drop your phone, stop glancing at Bachi's Yelp photos, shut the front door (quoted from Triple D) and order the RONIN burger. Have it done medium-rare. The Ronin burger left us wanting more. 

We also ordered the Miyagi-san burger. My friend likes it done medium and it wasn't as up to par and as savory as the Ronin. It looked excellent in presentation though.

The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries is a must get! It's a great item to share among 3-4 buddies. The part I liked most was the fried egg that they top the fries with. Genius.

In the span of our less than an hour savory visit here, we were helped by at least 4-5 waitresses/waiters. Everyone is so nice and attentive! The best experience I've had at a burger joint. (i.e. my friends and I were failing horribly at taking an #oscarselfie and a very kind waiter immediately rushed to our assistance at full speed. So very kind and extremely attentive! Thank you so much, everyone at Bachi!"}
{"text":"Burgers, salad, fries, drinks. It is all good here! The strawberry jasmine drink was excellent. Another of my favorites in Vegas that Ill definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Oh my god... oh my god. The calamari, fries with egg, and burgers are to die for. I had two different burgers and a sapporo because I'm on vacation and wanted to pig out. Both were very amazing"}
{"text":"Great originality burger concept!! This is a place for a bomb burger! Had the oxtail fries which took it to another level. A must try when in Vegas. Don't bother with the strip when looking for a decent burger. Well worth the drive off the strip!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers of all time comes from Bachi Burger.  The Miyagi will hit the spot every time. Ive ventured and tried other burgers.like the Bahn Mi and the one with Bleu Cheese, both very good, but for own taste buds its all about the Miyagi. Also.tried the Ox tail chili fries...its chili fries, but made with shredded oxtail which tastes like beef.  You'd never know the difference. My favorite appetizer is the Japanese sausage.  Definitely worth trying. Get those! 
Oh yeah, last visit grossed me out. Our server was wearing jean that looked like they hadn't been washed for months.  Looked more like a mechanic than.a.server. I mean it was gross he was serving us food! Go shower and wash your clothes! Management! Ask you people to look clean please...even the people next to us were saying how dirty the staff looked..because it wasn't just our server."}
{"text":"kiki burger is what i get
truffle fries is what i like
the one page menu is what i most adore about this place, i dont like looking through pages and pages of items.  service was good and product is good.  been there 3 times already and will keep on going."}
{"text":"Even with all the poor reviews on service, (something we greatly dislike!) we gave it a try one afternoon. It was probably around 2 or 3 pm so it wasn't very crowded. Service was ok... not as bad as some other reviewers experienced. It's obvious that the restaurant is new and the wait staff is new but they are working out the kinks. It's a mixed bag of people working there... some were spot on and attentive while others were too shy and one guy was cheesy, borderline annoying. They also need to quicken the pace with getting the food out sooner. We were probably 1 of 4 tables and it seemed like forever before the food came. 

So this is what we ordered:
Short rib buns
Ronin burger
Kalbi burger
Garlic salt and pepper fries

All very flavorful and tasty! However, I have to say the short rib buns were my fav. And I could have munched on the fries forever. Really good! The burgers are a good size and easy to eat. Burger places these days seem to pile on so much stuff that it's so outrageously big that you can't even bite into them. Not the case at Bachi Burger. 

All in all, we would visit Bachi Burger again. It's nice to have options such as Bachi Burger away from the strip."}
{"text":"Our first time we were going to try Bachi Burger, there was a 30 min wait for lunch. So when we finally went back to try it, we were less than impressed . First, the guy who seated us seemed less than happy about having to seat us. Some people came in behind us and asked if we were all together, my husband said \"no,there's 2\". It took the server way too long to figure out that the other people would be a table of 4. As he was seating us, he was yelling at the bus girl about why there was a 6 top set up, pretty rude, all in all. 

We got seated, then the people behind us got seated a couple minutes later, but somehow, the server went to greet those people first. Ok, but then it was another full 5-7 minutes before we were even approached. When Melissa finally came over, we were greeted by overly fake niceness. Never asked if we'd ever been there before, made any recommendations. She never asked if we wanted a drink to start, so we placed our order. We order the Bachi pickles, which are an APPETIZER, which usually means it comes FIRST. Nope, not at Bachi Burger, we got our fries and then our burgers and then asked if we still wanted the appetizer.  When we said no. Melissa asked if we were sure. The manager did come over and offered an explanation that there was a shift change going on and he offered his apology. Didn't actually say \"I'm sorry\" but said he wanted to offer his apology, which he never did. 

When we got our meals, Melissa was kind enough to bring extra napkins. And then more napkins even though we never used the first set of extra napkins she brought us, I took this as an implication that maybe we were slobs, interesting, since we hadn't spilled a drop. Oh well. 

Not a great experience. Bachi Burger was recommended to us by a friend and we saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and were looking forward to a burger experience. We didn't get anything more or special than we would have gotten at any other burger place. We've actually gotten better service and much less $$ burger joints. It was a \"been there, done that\" experience for us. Not one I'll look to repeat anytime soon."}
{"text":"After two days of driving for hours and surviving on Bunnies (Trader Joe's Annies Chocolate Chip Bunnies), this was my first real meal of the trip.  Why not go all out and splurge on a $20 burger?  Doing it.

Shogun Burger (medium) - Wagyu beef, foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter.  That's $20 worth of yumminess in yo mouf right there.  Definitely worth it
Truffle Fries - It was topped with what looked like gravy; something I wasn't use to.  Truffle and parmesan was subtle.  Texture was not as crispy.  I was quite disappointed with the fries here

Me: What's that pink fruit right there?
Dylan: It's a Yamamomo berry
Me:  Spell it and I'll eat it
Dylan: Y-A-M-....... (struggling)
Me: Forget it, I'm not eating it

Our server, Dylan, with his deep voice and charming smile was a good sport and provided us with great service."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Will definitely come back next time we're in Vegas. I love finding out of the way spots off the strip and this hit the mark! Shared a Ronin burger (Angus beef) and the Miyagi-San burger (wagyu beef) so we could try both types of meat. They were both delicious, though I preferred the wagyu. Had the salt & pepper garlic fries. One order is enough to share for 2 people. They were out of the brussel sprouts, but want to try those next time!"}
{"text":"Just tried Bachi Burger with a friend. 

Short - creative Asian fusion burgers that taste great but leave your wallet a bit lighter than you would expect.

We started with pork belly steamed buns  (bao). They were very tasty, but the pork belly was a bit tough and didn't have a crisp sear on it. The addition of soft boiled egg slice was a nice touch and the flavors were good.

For our mains we ordered the Kiki burger with waygu and the Bahn-mi burger plus a side of sweet potato fries.

Both burgers were excellent but the Bahn-mi burger was the star. It's a beef, pork and shrimp patty that comes on a bun stuffed with Vietnamese herbs and a side of fish sauce for dipping, really unique and super tasty.

The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. It's nice to see they are cut fresh in house,  but they need to be a bit thinner or dusted in starch to get crispy. I wouldn't recommend them. 

We followed up with Portuguese donuts and Coconut panna cotta for dessert.

The donuts were good, although nothing special.

The coconut panna cotta desert special was not good, it just tasted bland. There was a blueberry coulis on the plate that was delicious, but it was such a small amount that it was gone after the first bite.

The prices here seem high relative to what they are serving. The $16 burger turns into $21 when you add fries for example. Watch what you order as the prices will add up fast.

Overall this is a fun and original upscale burger place that you should definitely try at least once, but the prices may be prohibitive for most locals to make this a regular spot. 

There's very little value for your money to be had here, despite the dishes being hit or miss."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. But $12 a piece good? And without included fries? You have a lot of fancy ingredients and that doesn't make your burgers taste any better. This isn't a restaurant in a fancy casino on the strip.... save your money and go to In-N-Out and get a burger just as good."}
{"text":"This is me and my Hubbie's favorite place to go for date nights. The food and staff have never been disappointing. Growing up in Hawaii, this place gives us a little taste of home. We also make it a point to bring any out-of-town guests here to show them there is more to Vegas than \"The Strip.\" I highly recommend doing the same with your guests."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and Bachi has not yet disappointed.  If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.

And as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.

The fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!

This place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.  

PS - there's a new bigger spot also about 15 min away from the strip...but with traffic, can actually take much longer to get to, but if this place is too busy, at least you have a second option.  

Staff - Great!  Esp with the recommendations and the good humor.  Thanks Bachi! :)"}

{"text":"Frequency: Regular

My Usuals: Kiki Burger (medium rare), Ronin Burger (medium well), BahMi Burger (medium well), Truffle Fries and Jasmine Milk Tea

Wait Time: varies; weekends during lunch (12-2p) and dinner (6p-8p) expect to wait at least 1 hour | weekdays during lunch (12-2p) 30 mins avg.

Overall: I love this place! I frequented this place as a tourist but now living in Vegas...I swear I am always here whenever someone from out of town is here to visit and is craving Bachi (that's like every weekend. holy...). I do have to point out that the service here is rushed. They sit you down, get your order (think fast!), check in on you 1-2x, bill and out you go. I would love to sit down and actually enjoy my meal while I converse with friends but since it's crowded and busy most of the time, I guess they want to maximize profit. Nonetheless, enjoy the awesome goodness that Bachi Burger has to offer."}
{"text":"Oh - my - bachi - goodness. 

I got recommended to try Bachi Burger out after a nice dinner at Raku from the table who was sitting next to me... boy oh boy was that a good decision. I can't even eat a burger without thinking of Bachi Burger. 

The thing that separates BB from other burger places (and there are a lot of them) is their bun. The sweet (asian-y?) bun melts in your mouth and soaks in the deliciousness of the meat and sauces. Not only does it taste great, it's addictive. 

We also tried their famous chilli fries - the one that Guy tried - and I found them pretty OK. They use thin cut fries, which I personally like better than the chunky fries, but then again that's just preference. 

My favorite burger was the Kiki since the sauce they put in it was killer, in a good way of course. I'd say skip the milkshake - not too good. Just try everything out, it's great!

Obviously people know about this place since it gets super busy so be sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!   My dad lives in Vegas and this place is right down the block.  This is now a must stop every trip!  We split the black and green burger and the wagyu burger. The black and green burger has bleu cheese, roasted garlic, bacon, mushrooms and spinach.  The wagyu burger has a fried egg, crispy onions, caramelized bacon, and chili mayo.  Both were awesome, but I give it to the wagyu burger.  The fried egg pushed it over the top.  Both burgers were cooked perfect.

We also ordered the salt pepper garlic fries, Truffle Parmesan fries, and sweet potato fries.  I would say the Truffle fries are best without the sun dried tomato sauce they provide and the garlic fries were best with the garlic chili sauce.  I give the garlic fries the edge as the truffle fries needed more truffle oil on them.  The sweet potato fries were good, but I am not really a fan of sweet potato fries.  If you like them, these are great.

This place is great and I would drive out of my way to get my hands on these burgers.  Bravo Bachi Burger, keep cooking!"}
{"text":"Listen up folks, yelp exists for a reason.  See all those 3.5 star reviews for all the overpriced restaurants on the strip.  You know the ones that don't live up to and are more expensive than the original locations in New York and Los Angeles.  The ones that don't really care about how good the food is, because the celebrity chef whose name is on the marquee is at least an entire desert and mountain range away.  Those famous name places in the hotels, they care as much about return customers as those slot machines do.  They both know that as soon as they take your money, the next stooge is going to sit down in that same seat.

Bachi Burger belongs on the strip.  It so good and different that it should be featured in the Bellagio or the Wynn, but you aren't going to find it there.  You are going to find it tucked away in a hard to see corner of a strip mall south of the airport.  This gem who MUST expand to other locations, is a concept from Chef Lorin Watada, who has worked for Roy's for many years.  The fusion of Asian flavors and burgers are so perfect together, I have no idea why nobody else has really come up with an entire menu of it before.  Sure you sometimes see a Teriyaki burger on a menu, but this is a completely different level.

We started off with Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns.  While not listed as an appetizer, they are like 3 mini sliders, so good for sharing.  The buns were nice and sticky and folded taco style around a slice of sweet duck breast, cilantro, slice of egg, thin slice of radish, scallions, black Chinese vinaigrette, and hosin BBQ sauce.  While they were a good starting point, never order them in place of a Burger! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#3zjM4SbAXTNr8cRrcyHDeg

I split two burgers with my brother.  Both were so good, we couldn't decide which one we liked better.  First was the Ronin Burger.  7oz of Angus beef topped with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, miso goma dressing, and katsu BBQ sauce.  On the side was yuzu citrus aioli.  I also had them add Gruyere cheese.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was nice and pink.  The juices of the burger and the katsu BBQ sauce went so perfectly together I couldn't distinguish them as separate entities anymore.  The Japanese cabbage slaw had a nice crunchy sweet vinegar flavor to offset the texture of the burger.  I'm usually not a huge fan of a fried egg on my burger, but this just seemed so right.  So many times, burger joints throw on a fried egg for \"shock value\".  Somehow on this burger it was tastefully done to enhance the burger.  The miso goma sauce was on the slaw side of the bun.  The sweet rice wine/ sesame flavor worked perfectly with the slaw.  At this point my taste buds were just singing.  How could you need more flavor?  What was this yuzu citrus aioli about?   I added some of it just on one bite, and  found that the burger really didn't need it at all.  In fact that was the opinion I had about every side of sauce served with each item.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#8s5ab8tv_OI9keGxjmPErw

The second burger may have been even better!  More unique in flavor for sure.  The Banh-Mi Burger.  Ok, brace yourselves.  The patty is made up of...ground angus beef, pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, and plenty of other herbs and spices.   It was topped with pickled carrots & radish, cilantro, curry aioli, and lettuce.  The nuoc mam dipping sauce (fish sauce with lime, garlic, vinegar, etc..) was served in a large bowl on the side.  Plenty of room to dip your burger in the bowl.  But once I did that, I felt the strong sauce covered up the wonderful flavor of the burger.  Again we had it medium rare and the juices were everywhere.  For those that complain that the burgers are too juicy and the bun can get soggy....Eat it faster!!!  I actually thought the bun held up well.  A burger that tastes this good, isn't going to last long on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#ETcasvkOZaGaNUM3ZVIoQA

A burger isn't complete without some fries.  We had the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were enough to share.  This isn't your usual truffle oil just poured on the fries, it's black truffle porcini cream.  WOW it was great, but not very much of it.  I wonder if you can get extra of it on your fries if you are willing to pay more.  The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced thin.  Topped with a small amount of slightly melted parmesan cheese.  Really after you got past the the top layer of fries, there wasn't much topping left, so share nicely everyone!   We stayed away from the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce as the flavor overpowered a much superior flavor of the fries.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#z7-52AroniBC5F63yI0D4A

Nothing left to say other than GO NOW!"}
{"text":"We came to enjoy a great burger everyone was talking about...from the time we came in to the time we received our food was over an hour, and the food brought to us wasn't even what we ordered! When we informed our server she argued this is what we asked for... When we asked for management Joseph Perez (regional General Manager) also had the same approach. Unfortunately this establishment needs a class around customer service!"}
{"text":"We love Bachi Burger especially the crab cake sandwich and truffle fries.  

What I don't love is the kids menu. It's beyond overpriced to the point where we sometimes chose not to go. Last time we went the kids meal was $11.50 because they charged $1.50 for a slice of cheese.  The burger is too big for kids ordering off the kids menu.   Please add a mini burger or sliders for the kids. My 4 year old can not eat all that food, she can't even fit the burger in her mouth. The entire concept is ridiculous, too much food and too high priced."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've had.

I ordered the Miyagi-san burger, which came with my medium rare wagyu beef patty, fried egg, crispy onion rings, furikake caramelized bacon, and their chili mayo sauce. I also got to try their yuzu citrus aioli sauce on the side free of charge since our order took quite a long time. 

The burger was a work of art when it came out. It was a tower of juicy goodness as the sauces ran down the burger. Getting messy was inevitable, and I had no shame diving into the burger. The first bite left me feeling overwhelmed with satisfaction (I was starving to begin with). There was so much flavor in the burger, and that Asian kick you get from the sauce they used was fantastic. 

I can't recommend this burger place enough. If you're a big fan of burgers, Bachi is a place not to be missed."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! LOVED this place. (I emphasis the word LovED as in past tense) It's been a while since I've been back and I finally decided to go this Sat night with my family. Highly disappointed. There was no hostess to greet, it was not busy at all but yet we waited to get greeted, waited 10 min for a table (when all I can see were empty chairs) Then once seated underneath our table and the table next to us was so dirty with food and broken glass; it was beyond disgusting. Then waited another 15 min until Are waiter decided to show up. He took our drinks and asked him if we can place our order as well. He said no. (LOL) My husband went to the restroom and came back to say it smells like it hadn't been cleaned in months. At that point, WE LEFT! Someone needs to get Gordon Ramsey in here to clean the place up and find good management before this place has to shut down."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate a 4 because the food is amazing, but service was so off today!!!

We were greeted and seated right away, which is a plus for noon (we came at just the right time - right after the restaurant filled up). We were started with waters to drink, which was perfect.

However, during service was not what it usually is - our server kept paying attention to one table, which seemed to be friends of his, he refilled everyone's water in his section, but mine (drinks refills are huge with me, and the fact that my water was empty and NO ONE refilled it definitely took a whole star away), and he didn't do a check back with us until we were practically done eating. 

Once we were clearly done eating and I are most of the ice in my cup (see picture), STILL no refill and a few other servers walked passed our table, let alone attempt to pre-bus or offer dessert. Our server finally came back, asked if we were all done (no shit, Sherlock!) and we asked for our check. And still - no water refill!!!! The worst part about it is there was another server right next to us with a water pitcher, looked at our glasses and he walked right passed us.

I love the food here, but man this experience sort of ruined it for me! Maybe I'll have to check out the Bachi on the west side of Vegas?

Note: forgot to add a few things
- burger was medium well, when it was supposed to be medium
- the burger itself was not seasoned
- oxtail chili cheese fries were 80% beans
- oh, and didnt I mention I didn't get a water refill? (Just kidding!)"}
{"text":"OMG ! The food here was better than expected! We Tried the Oxtail Fries and Wagu Burgers both were amazing! Absolutely will go here again and recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and looking for a good place to eat away from the Strip. I saw Bachi Burger through Yelp. My family and I decided to try it. Hubby and I ordered a burgers $16 each and we shared the garlic fries. It was delicious! My oldest daughter tried the Ramen and gyoza. Taste just like food from Japan since we lived there for 6 years. My other daughter ordered from the kids menu and it was okay. I just thought the kids meal are overpriced. $12 for kids meal:-( But overall, food is good, but expect for a high bill if you are bringing your whole family."}
{"text":"If you want delicious burgers that are a bit out of the ordinary, this is the place to visit, and expect a wait.  The oxtail fries were outstanding and my adult son raved about the shakes.  I had a Ronin burger, added bacon and jalapenos, it was very tasty.  Everyone enjoyed the meal, and the service was good (not great).  The only issue was the one stall restroom, it was disgusting."}
{"text":"My family and I went here on a trip to Vegas and based on some serious good reviews and recommendations had to try it out....hands down best burger I have ever had! We all got a little something different but I decided on the Ronin medium rare holy cow this was awesome! the wagyu literally melts in your mouth and the fresh veggies just are a nice added touch My wife got the ....then the absolute topper was the chili oxtail fries holy cow the best fries ever. I didnt tell the kids what they where eating at first and then they were a little weirded out, but still thought that these where the best chili fries they had ever had...

The day we where there it was packed but didn't set us back from getting in quickly for a party of 10 and fast service...waitress was so nice and on point. The dont have a ton of beers on tap, but decent enough amount to select from...but did have a great drink menu with some nice choices but not this time. I am not a huge fan of Vegas but next time I will be back to conquer another one of these burgers."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas!  Come here at least once or twice a month and it never disappoints.  Sometimes it can be busy but patience definitely pays off.  Really enjoy the ox tail chili cheese fries and the Miyagi San burger is my all time favorite burger anywhere."}
{"text":"The burgers here are probably the best burgers I have ever had, very flavorful with a creative presentation; but they take forever getting the food out along with terrible service. We were on the waiting list for 10 minutes being told that there are no tables or bar seats available, but a couple comes in after us and they quickly seat them at a bar. I of course complained and they really didn't do anything special which was upsetting of course. When we finally get a table and order, we waited for 20 minutes for the food to arrive. If they had better service, I'd give them 5 stars because their burgers are beyond wonderful; but I unfortunately can't because of the terrible experience I had."}
{"text":"I have been to Bachi- both the Summerlin and the Green Valley locations quite a few times now. Either my husband or I usually gets a severe Bachi craving at least once a month, and then only Bachi will do. Between us we've tried every burger on the menu, with the exception of the crazy-spendy Shogun, which I think will call for a special occasion, and we've settled into almost ritualistic favorites.

The Ritual:
- If I'm at Windmill, I will start with the Yuzu-Cherry soda, Summerlin, beer.
- Then salt and pepper fries with those glorious little jalapenos, so perfectly crispy and salty and share-able.
- Then I order the Kiki Burger, which is pretty much my favorite burger of all time. Juicy, sweet, and just the right level of sloppy. Mushroom heaven. 
- My husband orders the Spicy Miso burger, and eats it in approximately six seconds and moans softly to himself in joy.

The prices are a bit on the high side for a \"burger joint\", but Bach isn't really that, so don't go with that expectation. It's more of a unique local \"nice, but lower key\" bistro or something. It is one of the Go-to places both my husband and I drag our foodie friends and family when they fly in to visit, and it always gets rave reviews. 

I personally think I like the Summerlin location a bit better (except they need the cherry-yuzu soda. seriously.) I've feel as though I've just had my burgers a little bit better put together and more well cooked there. 

I've never had anything I didn't like there, other particular favorites were the Ronin and the turkey burger I can't remember the name of, but we just like that order so very much it's hard to deviate. When I go to Bachi, it's explicitly for that glorious mushroom-y Kiki. Mmm. Now I need to go to Bachi."}
{"text":"It exceeded our expectations! Finally made our way here and it didn't disappoint. We started with the strawberry lemonade and apple lychee soda, the fresh strawberry in the lemonade definitely made it a winner. We wanted to start with the cauliflower and crab dip, which they had run out of (ugh), but we had the pork belly buns and they were yummy! We got the Kiki and Mr. Ho's burgers with the Parmesan truffle fries... Everything was TO DIE FOR! I would highly recommend this spot. We did come in kind of late, so the service was so-so, but with food this good, it completely made up for it. Can't wait to come back and try new things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice, and loved both visits! I'm so happy that we have Bachi Burger in So Cal now, although I haven't had a chance to visit the new locations yet. I really enjoy Asian fushion bar food, so I had this place on my food wish list for a long time before my first visit here. 

Since this place is super popular, try to come for an early lunch or dinner to avoid the crowd. You must order the oxtail chili cheese fries, this dish is perfect to share and is absolute perfection. I love oxtail, cheese, fries and fried eggs so this dish has my name written all over it! Get this, or you'll definitely regret it! For burgers, I've tried the Ronin, Miyagi-San, and Spicy Miso. My fave was the Spicy Miso. I enjoyed the others but found the Miyagi-San to be a bit too dry. I usually order my burgers well done, but I get them med well here so it won't be so dry. Don't forget to order a delicious beer to wash all this yummy goodness down, they have a nice selection. 

Awesome place, and I always try to come here when I'm in Vegas! Can't wait to visit the new locations in So Cal! :)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday because it was near the south point casino. Saw it on DDD and was excited to try. My group had the spicy edamame, oxtail fries, Miyagi san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the Bahn Mi Burger, and the Kiki's Burger. 

Edamame was addicting. I call them Japanese french fries. 
Miyagi burger was the most familiar thing I had tasted with the fried egg and onions on the burger.
The Bahn Mi burger was good with the strong taste of the pate being my only dislike.
The Kikl's Burger was tasty but the sauce was a little sweet for my taste.
The Oxtail fries were really good. theres something about a fried egg broken all over fries that just makes everything come together.

Overall it was a good experience. Would like to go back and try the pork buns and the spicy miso burger. Will return soon."}
{"text":"This place is always behind schedule! Just spend you money elsewhere! Staff is inconsistent and its just a waste of time..... i have been here more than 10 times. Throwing money away if I could give less than 1 star I would..."}
{"text":"I make a stop at  Bachi Burger whenever I am in Vegas, even when it's a matter of hours and not days. I am still in love  with the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, but my go- to burger lately has been the Ronin. They renovated the inside and it looks great, much more inviting. The drinks are always interesting and delicious, it's never the standard fare here. I really appreciate that, because who wants to pay for a meal that they can make at home? I can make a cheeseburger, however an Angus Beef burger patty with Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli is not as easily done. So the Ronin is a delicious meal that I highly recommend. I always leave Bachi Burger full and happy."}
{"text":"Been to all 3 locations and they're pretty consistent. Always pretty busy, food quality always quite high, service always just decent, prices always high.

Pros: Burgers are excellent, usually cooked right. Very very tasty combinations. They have beer which is great for a high quality burger. Locations are convenient in different parts of town.

Cons: Way over-priced, about 25% more than I'd expect to pay. Fries are gross because they are those shoe-string style that are basically 1% potato and 99% batter. Most locations very busy and food comes out very slowly.

Will eat here again sporadically because the burgers are just so damn tasty. Wish they'd change their fries and lower their prices though, then I'd come weekly."}
{"text":"We go to Bachi Burger pretty much every time we visit Vegas. We love it! They make an amazing burger and their oxtail chili cheese fries are to die for! The Loco Moco burger is my favorite. It's bunless and served on risotto. We haven't tried their ramen yet, but it always looks amazing. Definitely one of my favorite burger places ever."}
{"text":"I was really excited to take my brother here as he has never been.After waiting for about an hour for our food we had to get back to work.I was really bumbed we didnt get our food now have to go back to work on an empty stomach.I understand its hawaiian asian themed but really need to get off hawaiian time in a normal world."}
{"text":"Pretty bummed. What a great little place but I'm not likely returning anytime soon. My wife and I sit down at 6:30, no line and no one at the door while the team shoves a 74 dollar burger dinner down our throats over nearly 38 minutes. Seriously, the ambiance sucked as a 25 year old supervisor is running through the place like a mad man yelling table numbers and reset directions at a bunch of staff that aren't near him or listening to him and creating chaos around the room. Staff are trying to clear items not done, I was 2/3 thru my burger when the server stopped the check. Are you serious? Still no one at the door. Too many great places in town to pay 16 dollars for a medium well burger ordered mr and get rushed out of the place. Sharing review with friends. A Shame too."}
{"text":"Wowzers! Great handcrafted burgers! I can't wait to go back to Vegas....you can be sure Bachi burger will be first on my list to eat at!

For starters we ordered the oxtail chili fries, they were delicious and come with a fried egg on top. A must try for anyone. We also ordered the Brussel sprouts and they too were delicious.

Burgers ordered:
Ronin Burger
The Banh-mi burger
Black & Green burger
Kikis burger

Each burger had a different amazing taste. I had never been at a table where everyone passed their burgers around so everyone can taste. It was not only fun but delicious, everyone of them.  My husband ordered the Roasted baby beet salad and it was to die for. Although we were all stuffed we opted to go for the dessert and share it. The seasonal warm bread pudding. We were stuffed but could not put our forks down. 

I recommend this to all local and visitors. It's worth the drive out."}
{"text":"Went to get take out. The greeter hands us two menus and sends us to the bar area. 10minutes of standing, and not a single staff member acknowledges our presence. 

This place isn't that big and they had at least 4 waiters wandering around. Not to mention the guy who put us there in the first place. Fail. 

We left."}
{"text":"I came to Bachi Burger after seeing many great reviews, and some not so great reviews.  Bachi Burger proved to be a great restaurant, with very unique features that make it better than the average restaurant.  
I actually went out on a limb and took some friends from out of town to Bachi Burger to show them some unique, but still familiar food in Las Vegas.  
We started with the sausage plate, fried chili chicken, and the truffl-parmesan fries.  The sausage plate had two types of sausage, both good, but not great; one of the sausages made from kurobuta pork.  Both had great texture, but the flavor was good, but very traditional.  The fried chili chicken was the best appetizer we had, and the chili-garlic sauce was what made it so special.  The chicken was lightly breaded, fried, and coated with a light chili sauce.  The sauce was a little spicy, but the dominant flavor is toasted garlic.  The truffle-parmesan fries were very good, and were served with a porcini mushroom cream on top.  It is also served with a creamy dipping sauce that is very good.  Maybe a little more truffle would have made it better, but the fries were very good nonetheless.  

For entrees, we had the Rhonin Burger, the Kiki Burger, and the Steamed Duck Buns.  
The Rhonin Burger was very good, served with a soy glaze, asian style cole slaw, and a very good yuzu-citrus aioli.  The yuzu aioli made this very unique, and brought great acidity to the burger, balancing the boldness of the soy.   
The Kiki Burger was the best thing, served with two types of mushrooms, and a garlic-chile aioli.  This was the best overall because it worked best together as a burger.  Each bite had layers of flavor, and got better each bite.  
The Steamed Duck Buns were also very good, with the Duck being the highlight of this dish.  The Duck was very moist and flavorful, and worked well with the five-spice hoi sin, boiled egg, and soft steamed buns.  
We tried the Junmai cold sake, and was very impressed with how it went with the food.  Red wine would also go very well with the burgers, and they said that they will serve it very soon.  The thai iced tea was pretty good, but the texture seemed watered down.  A very minor flaw in a overall great meal.  
For dessert, we got the Walnut Bread Puding, which was served hot, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  They said they had their own pastry chef make everything fresh daily, and you could tell.  The bread pudding was soft, and very flavorful, and worked perfect with the crunch of the toasted walnuts.  Great dish!
Overall, the flavors that Bachi Burger has in all of the dishes we had were very unique, and worked perfectly.  It is very affordable for the food you get, and it a must try for anyone who lives in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here was good. However most of the things that I wanted to order they were out of and mind you I came when they opened. Service was excellent. Waiter kept apologizing for running out of the things I wanted and explained that their shipment came during later hours. He offered alternatives for what I wanted. Their fried squid legs was fabulous!!! And fries were super good. I really liked the pineapple ketchup. 3 stars was because I originally wanted to try the veggie burger that they offered and was extremely excited to try it, but they were out. I will return to try it, if they have it when I visit again."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are great but it is a bit to pricy for my pocket book."}
{"text":"i really wanted to like you bachi burger... but your burgers are just okay.

let's start with the service. i'm guessing that management read the negative reviews because our service was very good. we were asked if we needed a few more minutes to decide and once we ordered the server apologized for the wait. hmm... no apology needed.. we were the ones who needed more time!

the food didnt take long to come out. the crusty crab came out first with the garlic salt and pepper fries. i ordered the ronin burger which came out a few minutes later. 

the fries were really good at first.. but soon became a little soggy. i read that the mango chutney on the crusty crab was not very yummy so i made sure that my friend ordered it on the side. he said if it had been in the burger it would have made it too sweet. as a courtesy... i think the server asked for my sauce to be on the side. im not sure but it was nice. 

i liked the crusty crab over the ronin burger. i cut my burger in half and ended up throwing the second half away. i'll explain later. the ronin burger has a strong sour taste. it may be one of the dressings/sauces. i thought it was overpowering. i like the fried egg but thats about it. oh... well maybe the bun too. the bun reminds me of the top of the pork buns that are baked and not steamed. very soft!

so because i didnt like my burger i ordered the peking duck steamed buns because it was actually what i realllly wanted. but how could i go to a burger place and not order a burger right? should have gone with my instinct says my friend. the steamed buns were quite tasty. the hoisin sauce went well with it.

so anyway.. my friend got sick and threw up a few hours later. we suspect it may have been the crab but who knows. i only took a bite and i was fine. but we pretty much had the same thing to eat the whole day. 

will i be back? only if im in the area."}
{"text":"I may of died and gone to burger heaven. I've eaten at ALOT of burgers in my lifetime. I found this gem thanks to a website as I'm traveling through Vegas I figured I'd try this spot out. Sadly there were no fries at the time I came (10:40pm) but I still had a burger which was AMAZING!!! Just a regular old burger nothing fancy yet oh so delicious! I don't know how they do it but the burgers have a juicy flavor in themselves. No condiments required to enjoy this treat. On my way through Vegas going home I'll for sure be back to try some other options!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try this place because I've heard so much about it from other food fanatics. I love me a good burger! I do give them an A for creativity, but that's really it. I WAS warned that this place is overhyped, and I'm sad to report that indeed, this place is overhyped. However, that is not to say don't come here at all. If you've never visited, give them a try! They have really fun burgers that deliver in taste. It just didn't satisfy my craving for a burger though.

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: The portion received could easily feed 4 people who are also ordering a burger. I felt like my beau and I barely put a dent in it! They really skimped on the oxtail and chili cheese though. Taste wise, it's good, but nothing amazing or memorable. I was pretty disappointed that it just tasted standard and you were lucky if you caught a small string of oxtail with your fork as you dug into the fries!

Banh Mi Burger: We just had to try this one. It does remind you of a banh mi! Great flavor, but it still left me wanting a burger. It just didn't do it for me.

Miyago Waygu Beef Burger: It had great flavor as well and perfectly prepared as requested, but it still didn't do it for me.

Service: Though friendly, it was kind of lacking. They start slacking off once they put in your order and don't check on you after the fact.

If you're looking for a fun and different take on burgers, please give this place a try. It'll be worthwhile because everything is prepared well. I also didn't really have a good first experience on account of the table sitting next to me, which is no fault of the establishment's whatsoever. They just made me feel so uncomfortable and I almost didn't eat my food because the older white lady was staring at me and commenting on how only skinny people could eat food like that, etc. Seriously? If I commented on your body type and looks loud enough for you to hear while staring at you as you're about to eat, I think you'd be equally uncomfortable. Thank God they left shortly after I bit into my burger. Rude."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a woman at the nail salon adjacent to the restaurant. We ordered a salad which was nothing special, some garlic fries which were DELICIOUS and a protein style burger. The highlight of the meal was the fries so if you go there definitely order some garlic fries (the sauce is comes with is also fantastic). The burger was good, it had a hint of a korean flavor to it (like a kalbi marinade) and I enjoyed it. The salad was really nothing special so I would pass on that. 

Service was excellent and the crowd was young and hip. Really enjoyed and will be back soon. Thank you Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burger from another universe, check this place out! Unique flavors will have your mouth watering, well after you leave. As a frequent diner of Bachi Burger, I have tried almost everything on their menu. Nothing has been less than amazing! Try their specialty burgers, I suggest the Ronin, Kalbi, or Banh-Mi Burgers. You will enjoy some of the best flavors your pallet will ever taste. 

Their fries, are unreal. Crispy, and packed with well balanced flavors you will find nowhere else.They have recently changed their Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries, making them, hands down, the best fries I've ever had!

Dessert? Bachi Burger's Strawberry Pop Tarts, and Portuguese Dough-Nuts are superior to most fine dining restaurants. Adding to them, is a side of unique ice creams, you can't get at DQ... Truly the work of a master pastry chef.

The service has improved tremendously, and the kitchen staff still putting it down! They get better and better every time I eat there. Making them a well rounded, well oiled machine of awesomeness! Stepping up to the plate to handle the demands of their quickly rising popularity. And still keeping their prices rediculously low, at about $10-$15 per person. Way to go! Amazing what you can do with a staff that cares, huh?

I will continue to spend my paychecks with them, until they cut me off..

P.S. I suggest the Chili Fried Chicken for an appetizer, they're to die for!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The miso burger is so good. Lol. Esp for a hamburger. Can get very busy. Awesome fries w pineapple ketchup."}
{"text":"Service is still slow, but the Lonely Bird has been consistently good! So far, my favorite turkey burger in Vegas. Just make sure they don't forget to bring you the Herb Pesto sauce on the side. Come here when it's busy - you'll get served faster. It seems that the less customers they have, the longer it takes for your food to come out."}
{"text":"The Banh-Mi Burger was outstanding! 
The Asian style seasoning may have spoiled me for life on burgers!
The Truffle/Parmesan Fries were excellent as well!"}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday night around 7ish and were met with a 30 minute wait. Not a problem, as it appears this is a pretty popular place. Once we were seated and our orders were taken(Kiko(or whatever the one with mushrooms was called) burger with the garlicky pepper fries(again, I forget the real name) for me, kids bachi for the little one, Caesar salad with burger patty for the wife, oxtail chili cheese fries for dad, and whatever mom got), the wait began. After a while(and several others who were seated after us getting their food as we sat hungrily) the server informs us that there was some mix up with the chef, and that he was bringing a free appetizer to apologize. I like the way they handled it, and we especially liked the chili fried chicken they gave us, so I'm not going to tear this place apart in this review. Once the food did come, it looked good and the portions were not bad. The food itself was OK. None of us were wowed(I was actually happy he missed that I'd ordered fries after tasting my mom's, which were the same I ordered), but it wasn't nasty. I guess it was slightly disappointing given the hype(DD&D) and wait(which we somewhat enjoyed in the old school candy and soda store a couple doors over. I do recommend going in here), as it isn't somewhere I will likely return to. The wife didn't particularly care for here either, and dad thought it was just OK. For all the L.A. peeps reading this, I consider it of the same genre(and price range) as Fukuburger(feel free to read my review of that joint), but I think Fukuburger taste a lot better. For everyone else, feel free to try for yourself and see what you think. I will neither recommend nor not recommend this place, so you're on your own."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a nice place to go to if you are a fan of burgers and want to experience a different taste/kind of burgers. They are Asian infused and many of them contain an egg in the burger. 

Our server was great. She was friendly and very helpful. I ordered the Salty Caramel Marshmallow Fluff milkshake. It was very good-anything salty caramel is good in my book! For an appetizer we ordered the edamame seasoned with something that was on the spicy side-I forget exactly what it was. The flavoring they used was so good! I then ordered the Spicy Miso Burger. It was a good burger but I was a little disappointed because I didn't think it was spicy at all. I think next time I would try a different burger. 

It was a cool unique place because not everyone has burgers like that. I think if you haven't been here and are a burger fan I would recommend it to you."}
{"text":"Heard about this all the way from Hawaii had to check it out. If you not used to the hear wait in your car, there is always 15 to 20 min wait. Got seated pretty quickly as I was greeted by all staff members! Had my favorite beer Hitachino! Almost ten dollars but worth every penny. Tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and roasted pork on bun. Fantastic. For the main course was miyagi burger and kalbi burger, on point like island flavor Alan wong's American fusion. A must try at least once in LV..."}
{"text":"I HATE THEIR SERVICE!!! Although everything on the menu is delicious! Ugh! I get so torn to come here because of it. Ever since they changed out their old staff, the new staff is horrible. Not so much of rude but just lack of customer service or inexperienced. I think they try to hard to be a little fancy or proper but it just ain't happening in this joint. 

However, on a more recent visit, I dined in with my husband and infant (brought him in with his car seat) and totally forgot about the sucky service! The host walked us to our table and kindly brought over a high chair for my baby. He then flipped it upside down and said for us to place baby's car seat on there. My husband and I didn't agree with putting out baby (or his car seat) on the bottom of the dirty high chair where it's been dragging all over the ground. So I asked if we can just have another chair AND the response he gave me was baffling! He said, \"So you're OK with putting your baby on a chair where he can fall?!?!\" Yes, you'r damn skippy, I gave him the dirtiest look AND he was lucky I kept my mouth shut. I replied, \"yes and smiled (while doing whatever possible to put my baby's car seat on the chair the safest way possible).\" Seriously, am I that stupid to just put an unsteady car seat on a chair. Anyway, point being, he should've just it to himself. 

So after this experience... I don't know if I will be going back unless I really have to! I'd rather go to the Summerlin location, nice staff (a little slow) and less crowded."}
{"text":"If you are looking for gourmet Asian influence burgers this is the place to go. I had the crusty crab burger as well as a regular burger and both were fantastic. The fries alone could bring me back. Just outside the strip 10-15 minute drive but well worth it. The only bad thing was that the service took a bit of time. Other than that the food was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST GO whenever you visit Vegas. I wish they had one in Cali. 

My boyfriend and I always get top notch service here. This is our second time here in two years. They are so tentative and made sure we were happy throughout out meal. 

Let's start with the basic. 
Oh dear lord. THE BURGERS!!  The first night we touch down on Vegas we came here! Boyfriend and I had the kiki burger and miyagi San burger with a side of salt and pepper fries. Everything was made to perfection. I felt like lord Jesus Christ came down and blessed my burgers. It was truly  amazing. All the ingredient mashed together and made sweet love in my mouth. 

The fries!! We usually get the truffles but the salt and pepper was to die for. With some jalapeño sprinkled on it? Ingenious. Simply ingenious. And the portions were a hefty amount I wouldn't be surprise if they used an entire ox in my fries... 

 The last night we were in Vegas we wanted to go out with a bang. So we had the shogun burger with ox tail fries. I personally like the salt and pepper fries but the ox tail was good too for you meat lovers. 

People probably be like damn girl. You paid 26 dollars for a burger? You bet. And id do it again in a heart beat. 

I don't know what they did to their burgers but oh my oh my, your in for a treat. If your in Vegas, you have to try this place!! It's worth every penny. 

Jackiee approved."}
{"text":"Truffle fries: sooo yum! 
Veggie burger: not my kind of veggie burger, but the tofu on it was exceptional. I would order an entree of that glazed tofu if it was on the menu!
Milk tea: yummy

 since my last visit I have started eating meat again, so I'll have to go back to try their meat burgers, and oxtail chili fries."}
{"text":"Ah, I am having such a hard time reviewing Bachi Burger.  This is when I wish yelp had half stars.  I think they are a strong 3 1/2 stars, but I bumped them to 4 because three seemed too low.  If you read my reviews, you'll find out I love burgers.  I have had some fantastic burgers in my life, and while bachi burger is good, it's not my end all be all.  I really like the concept.  They have some great flavor combinations, and I love the creativity.  Don't get me wrong, my burger was good, it just wasn't the best I have ever had.  I tried 4, yes 4 milkshakes, and let me be honest, they are fantastic.  The milkshakes make me happy.  The oxtail chili fries...oh man.  Those are a must.  If you find yourself in Vegas, I would say you should definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Very good burgers.  Excellent service.  Skip the 'organic' coffee -- it's gross.  Sorry I can't tell you what I ordered. I tried accessing the menu, but their web site isn't cooperating."}
{"text":"LOVE the truffle fries and the black and bleu burger! A little pricey, but worth it! If you want a new Asian fusion restaurant, this one is always a favorite of mine"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  We really enjoyed this.  Very tasty burgers.  So many good choices.  We'll have to come back again and try all of the burgers"}
{"text":"Found ourselves at Bachi after a long weekend, hungry for food that wasn't fast food,  yet not lemme-just-stuff-myself-silly buffet style either. Overall: love the concepts and menu but with a couple hangups!

FOOD: downright delicious. Not gonna lie, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the truffle fries ($5.5) (medium cut, parm cheese, truffle gravy drizzle + sun-dried tomato aioli)...what in the holy hayellllll. This was so amazing! I could eat this literally as a side to every meal. The truffle wasn't overwhelming and I love the substitute of the aioli for like, Heintz ketchup or something. Very classy, Bachi. The Kiki burger ($11) was #1) cutely named and #2) cooked to perfection with the best flavor combo ever! I loved the bun, as it was somewhat sweet and pillowy. It had a mix of mushrooms, a bacon/sweet onion glaze and gruyere cheese. 

SERVICE: Not that great. It took a long time to get our food (30+ minutes). We were only 4 girls and didn't order anything out of the ordinary or massive amounts of food. Heck, the restaurant wasn't even that busy .. not all the tables were full, so I'm still a bit stumped why it took so long.

DRINKS: The lychee boba milk tea was aiiiiight. Nothing special. They didn't put enough ice, so it was a bit warm and milky.. not really what I hoped for in 100+ degree weather. The lychee flavor was good though and not overwhelming.

OVERALL: Satisfied, good for a try, not sure if I would go out of my way for this again, but if you do, it'll be a good choice!"}
{"text":"I needed a new Asian fusion burger joint after the owner of Fukuburger pissed me off with a snippy reply to a complaint I had about his silly \"funny\" name rule in his restaurant.  I found Bachi Kitchen here on Yelp.  It's good, really a 3.5 rating, but not perfect.  The food is good, but for some reason they put cold truffle sauce on my hot truffle French fries which very quickly cooled off the hot fries.  Lesson learned - don't order that again.  The burgers were good and cooked to order.  They also have a pretty complete bar.  

I want to try one of their breakfasts next visit."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  MUCH better than umami burgers~

At first didn't know how to eat it since the burger was SO TALL!  Very hard time to put into the mouth, but there's always a way to chow down yummy food.  ^_^ They have quite a few interesting flavor combo which I'd like to try next time~"}
{"text":"We arrived at this location after we were told the Windmill location had a 45 minute wait. Thankfully this location is a lot closer to where I live. We were immediately seated in a booth that we asked for. The ambiance of this new location was great. Table and utensils were clean. The menu was extensive and took us a few minutes to decide what to order. I ordered the Ronin Burger. It was delicious. The presentation was well executed. We also ordered salt & pepper fries; the menu is a la carte. The fries were served with a dipping sauce, which I forgot the name of, but was very delicious.

The service was less than average. It could definitely be improved. We asked for refills for our water and he only managed to refill my cup and didn't refill my girllfriend's; she had less water than me. I will definitely be back to try a different burger and hopefully get better service."}
{"text":"Was hoping for better.  Service was very slow and the food took a long time to get out.  After being seated, it must have been 10 minute before anyone waited on us.  The food was fine, not great but was fine."}
{"text":"Awesome cooked to order specialty burgers and fries. I had the Miyagi-San Wagyu burger which included a fried egg, caramelized bacon, furikake, onion rings, and chili mayo. The burger was a solid 8.5 with the wagyu beef and onion rings dominating the flavor profile. The crunch of the onion ring was reminiscent of a Carls Jr. Western bacon cheeseburger. The oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries were super savory, although they were a bit salty. The sweet potato fries come with a citrus, horseradish sauce that I cannot reccomend. I made the mistake of sampling it last and the aftertaste ruined all the goodness I had earlier in my meal,  This location is a good size and can accommodate large groups. When I'm in Summerlin ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"the burgers were adequate. i'm undecided about this place since i just moved here. as far as impressions go, and our take-out order......wow........um........my girlfriend must have had the smallest salad in the world in her to go box. come on, for $8.50 you need more than something that couldn't fill up a rabbit........not going back. there ar ebetter deals in town."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a burger person but these burgers are tasty!!! The whole \"fusion\" idea is getting played out but I believe Bachi does it right.. 

We went around 5 and so the restaurant was empty. Pretty clean & modern looking space with the Food Network playing on their flat screens. 

We tried the crusty crab burger, kiki burger (mushroom) & added an egg and also the truffle Parmesan fries.. I didn't care much for the crab cake burger but the Kiki was delish!! Good quality beef and I liked the buns they use.. I can't wait to go back and try the oxtail fries and the black & green burger! 
The manager, Tomoko, came by to make sure everything was amazing and she was so sweet~ 

Tip: Sadly, they no longer carry the delicious looking lobster roll ;((("}
{"text":"So glad I was introduced to this place the last time we came to Vegas. Located off the strip, it's still a definite must have every time we go to Vegas! I love the way they use Asian fusion style in their burgers. The flavors go so well.

I've tried the Ronin burger and Miyagi San burger. Both really good and comes with a fried egg inside. We also shared the Parmesan truffle fries. Tastes great but my only complaint is that the fries are so small. It's like we were eating the small crumbs as opposed to whole sized fries. No biggie. My dining experience was still so worth it because of the burgers. The food does take a long time to come out (~20 min) but it's definitely worth the wait. They're cooked to perfection.

Next time I would love to try the Banh Mi burger. You really can't go wrong with trying any of them!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of fusion burgers, I would highly recommend going to this location. These Japanese inspired burgers harbor toppings that range from enoki to furikake.

Being a Karate Kid fan, intuition had me deciding on Miyagi-san's Burger (although I'm not sure if that was their intention...) with Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries and a short Sapporo. 

I would highly recommend getting this burger. Although lacking in fresh veggies (which isn't a problem), this wagyu burger has a smokiness and flavor unlike similar burger places e.g. Umami Burger. The list of ingredients is not as extensive as the other burgers, but simplicity makes this burger stand out. This sported chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and onion rings. 

The garlic fries were delicious as well. Compared to say Coco's Curry House's garlic fries, the seasoning is very well distributed and flavorful. Paired with the garlic chili aioli, I would highly recommend these fries to any first timer."}
{"text":"Oxtail Chilli Cheese were decent worth a try since it's so different but it's overwhelming good for about four people. 

Sho gun burger was bomb!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed by Bachi Burger.  In fact, I truly regretted wasting precious room for calories and fat on Bachi Burger and wish I had went over to Miko's instead and gorged on sushi and deep fried rolls.

To start off, the bf Landon L. and I stopped in around 10p on a Sunday night and the place smelled horrible.  I realize that parts of Las Vegas have this disgusting smell and if you happen to be the unfortunate restaurant, I feel badly for you.  However, I cannot help but have to include into the overall experience. 

We asked to seated outside but they weren't serving outside for some reason so we sat at a table close to the back.  This helped a lot with the smell.  Apparently, whatever it was was confined mainly to the front of the restaurant.

The service was very friendly but slow.  It felt like forever waiting for our burgers.  We ordered the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the black & green burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries, all of it quite boring and unimpressive and over priced for what you get.  Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to pay a lot of money for good food.  For example, $19 for the Buffalo Burger at Burger Bar?!  HELL YES. Any day!! Worth every penny.

I felt that the burgers at Bachi lacked flavor and punch.  They try to make them complex and \"fusiony\" but the ingredients were incohesive.  First, the Miyagi came with a fried egg, which was overcooked.  I guess when I order a burger with a fried egg, I expect the yoke to have some sort of runniness.  The black and green was okay, but really sweet.  And the Truffle Parmesan Fries were just okay as well.  We also ordered 2 beers.  All of this came to $45.  I would rather have given my $45 to Five Guys or In and Out.

I'm sorry but though the food is okay, I think everything about the menu is pretentious and the price tags are way too high."}
{"text":"Will never return.

Their speciality burgers are too weird for me -- ingredients I've never heard of like lup cheong sausage, shisito pepper and yamamomo peach.

On my husband's first visit, he ordered a regular burger.  It was okay, but at $15 it should be.

We had lunch here this week with friends who like the restaurant.  We didn't want truffle fries, so we ordered the \"Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries.\"  They were good, but had raw slices of jalepeño mixed in.  

Not wanting beef, my husband ordered the chicken/turkey 'burger.'  He said it was okay, but he wouldn't order it again.

Not wanting beef, I ordered a fish sandwich.  It's cod.  It should have been fine, but it stunk; smelled fishy which means the fish isn't fresh.  It also didn't taste good; I only ate half and left the rest.

It took a long time before anyone came to take our drink orders, even though half the tables were empty.

One bathroom was closed, so my husband used the second bathroom.  He said it was disgusting -- then an employee walked out of a stall and out the door WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!!!!

The restaurant is over-priced; the food is too weird for me.  What ever happened to a traditional burger?  If you want a speciality burger, I recommend Burgers & Brews inside the M.  And the whole bathroom thing....."}
{"text":"Just about perfect.  Nothing to improve on food quality.  The Kiki and Kalbi were delicious - my wife and I tasted each other's.  Asian fusion flavors sets these apart.  Great menu with lots of options - encourages return visits.  We're back again next week."}
{"text":"The food was above par but the service was terrible. I will certainly give this establishment a 2nd attempt next time I visit as the burgers and sides were cooked perfectly with great flavors and very fresh. The service was slow, as I waited 10 min to be seated and the establishment wasn't even busy. Ordering a side of sauce shouldn't take 5 min to reach the table. Great job back of the house. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Apps were great. We had the duck rolls, sausage, and oxtail fries. Burger however was raw in the middle. Staff and manager were terrible. The food usually makes up for the terrible service you receive at Bachi burger, but no one I hate to say."}
{"text":"Rating on food alone.  Service was great.  Ate the miyagi San burger but my egg was well done and I was looking forward to a runny yolk since there was not really a spread. BUT the crispy onions were great.  Got the calamari but it tasted like raw flour.  I don't think I will come back being that this was my second upset here."}
{"text":"Great burger quality. I ordered masala lamb burger. The burger was overly sauced. 
The ice tea was $4 and no free refills. 

Staff were friendly. Had to ask for ketchup 3 X"}
{"text":"Okay. I was updating this review and gave it a five star. I do have to adjust them to a four star however. 

The food and creativity is exceptional. The service is generally great. Today we were there for my wife's birthday and it took over one hour for our burgers. Others were served before us as well and they arrived after us. Three times we were told the food was going to be out in two minutes even though we never asked nor complained. The third two minute statement we timed it for fun and it was 22 minutes before hey came back to tell us our food would be cooked next. 

I advised the managers that on the forth time and after almost 1.5  hours  that this was disappointing as we were celebrating my wife's birthday. They did say ' for what it is worth, Happy Birthday'. I think they were genuine. 

Food came out past the 1.5 hour mark and my wife's burger was medium rare instead of well done and they heated it up instead of a new one due to time. By then, my wife was not happy, the burger fell apart and was not tasty. She ate a bite and took the kids and left. I waited for the check. The team at Bachi was nice to not charge for her messes up burger. 

Unfortunately when they are too busy or when they make errors they do not know how to properly take ownership and control the situation. It got worse and worse and spoiled a celebration.  

So this is still a great place with quality staff and food. They just need to get to a first class five star by dealing with adversity instead positively rather than matter of fact like. 

They did nothing really wrong. Just when it got bad, they were ill equipped to shine. 

4 star but 5 star food."}
{"text":"Was recommended to try this place by a friend of mine who is a local.  This place is outstanding!  I'll be coming back here again in the future.

Having choices of Wagyu beef for my burger was something I haven't seen since Mastros in Beverly Hills.  I'm starting to notice a trend of people using this more often than Kobe Beef.

I had the Miyagi-san burger.  The buns are soft and buttery, the tempura onions were amazing and the egg adds to the flavor presentation.  Side order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries and my vice... Thai Tea.

I like that they offer the option of adding a patty to their burgers.  While it would be impossible to fit it in your mouth with the leaning tower of ingredients found on this burger, I'm sure that for someone like me who is a protein hog would take advantage of it."}
{"text":"Just great yummy burgers! I have tried everything and my favorite thing is everything ! I've been coming here for years and years even before I moved to Vegas! I love the fries yummy!!! Vietnamese coffee is a little water down but it's ok."}
{"text":"Incredible burgers and do NOT forget the Pho 'next door'. Both can be ordered from either establishment (their connected by a short hallway). The Bachi side is usually slammed with customers, so if you're looking for a slightly quieter venue, peek thru the doorway into the Pho place and you'll likely find a quieter atmosphere. I am not really a burger person, but the hubby is. That said, I'm NEVER upset when he suggests Bachi Burger! The burgers are insane, insane, insanely great!! In fact, their entire menu is!!  YUMMM!!"}
{"text":"Waited for 53 minutes (probably more) to get the first item in our order. Ordered 3 burgers, 1 truffle sweet potatoes fries and a vietnamese coffee.  No one, including our waiter, bother to check up on us, informed us of any delays in the kitchen, or refill our water. It was as if the staff was too ashame to face us.  All it takes to turn this experience around was to check in with us and keep us posted that our meal is taking a little bit longer to prepare.  Maybe we would have like an appetizer in the meantime.  It took me 5 mins to finally flag down a person to ask about our order.  She did not even bother to ask what our orders were. Then it took her another 10 minutes to come back and let us know what our order is coming....which actually took 5 mins to come. Once our food did come out, we had 3 people check on us within 10 minutes. One lady, who I assume was the manager,  even came by to give an empty apology for the long wait. She did not bother to look at our table. I am extremely upset and disappointed.  I used to recommend this place to everyone that comes into Vegas but that will no longer be the case going forward. I highly doubt I will return. Thank you to our server for your employee discount but what we needed was a sincere apology and much better service."}
{"text":"it is hamburger in a Asian way... oxtail chili fries, pork belly bun....a okay"}
{"text":"I live in Summerlin so this place is a good 30 minutes away from me.  When I was finally on that side of town my friend and I decided to check it out!!  I was honestly expecting a little burger joint like in-n-out or something, but this is a nice sit down restaurant.  Casual and trendy.  

My friend told me what to order so I didn't even really need to look at the menu, but I was intrigued by their \"Burgers with a twist of Asian fling\" deal.  There are so many things I want to go back and try, this will definitely not be my LAST time! Our waiter was also very informative. He asked if we wanted to \"hear about the menu\" and I thought he'd never shut up... He explained EVERYTHING to a T.  I actually felt bad because I was already ready to order before I even got a menu! 

We started out our meal with the pickle plate.  I had no idea what it was but we saw it in a newspaper article that  was posted in the front.  My favorite part of the plate was the pickled garlic cloves.  I was expecting way too much garlic flavor, but wow I was surprised.  I would get a bowl of just that!!  The other items were mediocre, but it was worth trying it.  Very interesting idea! 

For dinner I had the Kiki's burger with sweet potato fries and sun dried tomato aioli.  It was delicious!!  The burger was amazing.  It came with a chili aoili on the side and that was actually my favorite part.  Next time I want THAT for my french fries too. My friend had the crab cake burger, and it was good!  I like it a lot for a seafood burger.  It was a little sweet which was odd to me, but very interesting flavor.  

I ended up spending $17 for a burger, sweet potato fries and the pickle plate.  Not TOO bad, but a little pricey for 1 person at a burger joint.  

HOWEVER, I would go back in a heart beat.  I actually can't wait to return so I can try something else!  Definitely check it out, you won't regret it....  The drink menu alone looks amazing.  I drank water, but next time I'm gonna have to get one of those boba milk teas everyone was drinking."}
{"text":"Went with my husband and I loved it. The reason I took off a star is that our app (Oxtail chili cheese fries YUM) arrived well before our drinks did. The burger was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing (though my husband wasnt a fan of the asian flavors)."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today, and I will definitely  be back. It's pretty pricey for me but definitely worth it. Love that they had burgers and ramen, my husband and kids enjoyed our meals.  Everything was so delicious and on top of that our server was awesome!!!! I'm all about good customer service and our server Dan made our first experience here even better!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a gourmet burger. I ordered the kalbi burger which had kimchee and kalbi beef. My burger was a little cold however and we had to wait a quite awhile for burgers like 40 minutes for them.  The wait was not too bad at all.  I would come back here again and eat. I wished I tried the fries, but I was really sick."}
{"text":"Food is really good 

Ramen , ox tail fries and the shrimp plate 

The staff sucks , never answers the phone for Togo orders , when I go to order in the restaurant there not busy the staff isn't doin a jack thing just sittin around on there phone , and there allways missing one item for a dish late night but the food is real good lol just the staff sucks !!!"}
{"text":"My husband ate here before & was always trying to get me to come but I was hesitant, boy was I wrong for waiting! We shared the crispy hand made onion rings for our appetizer which were delicious. I ordered the black & green burger & my husband ordered bbq Angus beef burger, yes they were amazing! I also ordered matcha green tea which I loved. Overall the Asian flare comes together so well with the burgers here that we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is great.Price is a little high but definitely worth it!We tried angus burger with fried egg and it was delicious!!we also tried sauted brussell sprouts for our appetizer and they were delicious also!
We will return again to experiment something new.if your into an Asian. Spin on burgers this place is gor you!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and I immediatey put it on my list of places to try. I go to Vegas often for work, so I siezed the opportunity next chance I had. Unfortunately, like most things on those Food Network shows, it was very over hyped. Nothing was memorable. The crazy chilli fries were okay. The burger was okay.

Nothing special."}
{"text":"Came on a late Saturday evening, April 16, 2011.

The place looked very hip and sleek, with nice leather couches at the waiting area.  For a Saturday night, when most are out drinking, there was a surprising amount of patrons.

I won't bore you with a rundown of our orders, but I will mention a few things:

- Great presentation of fries, go with a group of 4-6 so you can try em all.  Unless you're a fatty.

- The Vietnamese coffee had a strong hazelnut flavor.  Fail in my book.

- Your burger choice may be hit or miss... but I'm pretty sure you'll have some interesting flavors to talk about.  I think I'll follow Arvin T's lead and build my own solid and regular burger with their quality ingredients.

By no means cheap, come here for a bit of a tasting adventure at a chic spot.  Plus its off strip, so you can claim some street cred for bringing an out-of-towner here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Miyagi-San all the way. Oxtail fries are great too. One of my top three burger places."}
{"text":"The best burger place there is. Visited back in march. I had Ox tail chili fries which have layers of flavor! I here that an Ox tail chili burger maybe in the works! For my burger I had the 4 mushroom burger, can't tell you what type of shrooms but the flavor was amazing! When I am back in Vegas I will be dropping by before the drive back to Southern Cal."}
{"text":"My friends went on and on about how awesome this place was.  They saw this air on T.V. and have been fans every since.  So I agreed to meet them there.  They have some very bizarre \"Policies\" that you should know about.  First, when I walked in, I asked to be put on the wait list.  They do not put you down on the wait list until all parties have arrived per \"policy\".  So, had to wait for their arrival.  Meanwhile, the place was cramped with people waiting to be seated.  I witnessed many people come in and leave because of the 45 minute wait (It's 1pm mind you). We were seated and some guy comes up and slams waters down in front of us and leaves.  He spoke not one word to us.  I was shocked and starving.  Finally, another waiter comes by and takes our order.  I ordered just a regular bachi burger and asked for a second to be cut in half.  By \"policy\" they do not cut the food for you, but they'll bring you a knife.  What kind of place is this?  The burgers finally come out and I was very disappointed.  The outside of the burger was almost charred, the inside very dry.  Plus, it wasn't served with any fries.  You have to order those extra!!  Wow.  Would have been nice if the server had told me that when I was ordering.  The food was overpriced.  a lemonade was $4.00  They're trying to be this snobbish burger joint when really it's not all that.  Seriously?  I will never go there again.  Oh, and by the way, their waiters are rude and don't even talk to you.  I looked on the receipt and now I know why.  Because their tips are included.  They feel like they're getting tipped regardless, so they can treat you however they please.  I do not understand why people think this place is so great."}
{"text":"What can you say Best burger in Nevada.  Always the best service you can want
  2 visits  on my 1 week stay. Kiki burger, calamari appetizers,  banana  pudding.  Also beer and the best green tea."}
{"text":"We arrived here about 4:30pm on a Sunday night..and the wait was 50 minutes. Such a long wait, especially with 2 small kids screaming..but we waited it out.

We ordered the truffle fries, sweet potato fries, kiki burger and the ronin burger. The truffle fries were AMAZING! I can't wait to get them again! A must try!

Sweet potato fries were great and awesome dipping sauce.

My burger (the kiki burger) was very good..but I also noticed as some other reviewers that the meat was seriously hard..and I ordered it medium rare. It didn't fall apart but the taste of everything else was good.

I tried some of the ronin burger and it was pretty good..

I would come back and try different things"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying this was my first experience at Bachi Burger and I would recommend it to anyone. I went in the afternoon about 12:30pm or so. There was a couple customers in there, I knew that it was new and was very excited. But my first impression as I walked in was the amazing atmosphere.  The window where I could see what food was coming out was pretty cool. It was a different kind of environment then I have ever been to.

I was seated immediately and given many choices and recommendations to choose from. I had never been there and wanted to know what the servers recommended.  They were educated and well trained in the menu. I ended up getting the Miyagi Burger, and the truffle parmesean fries. 

The food came out within 15 minutes and not just saying this but it was the most amazing burger and fries I have ever had. Not like what you would get anywhere else. The servers came over many times asking if everything was ok. Which was a change to most sit down restaurants. 

I highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Good stuff near the airport. We had the brussel sprouts, oxtail fries and meso burger. All were very good. The burger is more along the lines of a gourmet burger, very tasty. The fries have amazing sauce added to them and the brussel sprouts were chopped in smaller pieces with a great sauce on them as well. The only things I would change, would be offering up a pretzel bun option and using fresh cut fries. Other than that the food is pretty amazing. Service was ok. Parking was like regular strip mall parking. The price was fair and I would return."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I need to go to this place!!! 
I tried almost every single burger and all honestly they don't make a bad burger! 

I would probably say my favorite is the shotgun burger, it has Asian pear and foie gras! So so delish! 
Also make sure you order their truffle fries! 

As for the appetizers the must haves are the sticky buns and ox tail chili cheese fries! So delish! 

This restaurant is also linked to a ramen place which is also very good! Try the burgers first then the ramen!

The service is really good. I think the waiting room is a bit small so we always just wait outside. I would suggest not going during rush hour otherwise the wait will be over an hour. 

The also serve alcohol so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you get here is that the parking lot smells of awesome grilled burger! And it only got better from there!

Our burger was amazing. I didn't get the fried egg on top, because we weren't incredibly hungry, but how awesome is it that you could get one on top!

We got the Kalbi burger and couldn't have been happier. The only thing that we weren't super happy with was the shishito peppers, we added them to the burger and couldn't tell that they were there. We should have ordered it on the side.

Since we didn't get the burger with the egg on it, we did get the Oxtail Chili Fries with the egg on top. It was really really good. The chili could have been a touch more flavorful, but overall it was super yummy!

We will definitely come back here the next time we are in Vegas, and you should too!"}
{"text":"First Time in Las Vegas and I was told I had to try this. For a family of 5 our total was $150. That was for 5 grass fed burgers and an order of Ox-Tail fries. The burgers were okay but the fries were mind blowing. I've never had fries with so many toppings be so good! Great flavor with a bit of a spice and a over easy egg on top. The service was great, the waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and knew which burgers were best. In my opinion the burgers were pretty bland in flavor but the meat quality was good. 
Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Bachi burger has great presentation and great service. The MR hos burger is amazing along with the salt and pepper French fries .. The pineapple ketchup is so amazing too. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and always got good service and great food. I don't know what happened to the management but we have been sipping water waiting on basic burger and fries for nearly 45 minutes. We have been checked on once but still waiting. The waitresses are snots that think they are too good to wait on people - you're a waitress, stupid!  Doubt we will be back ever again."}
{"text":"Still my favorite mid-range priced gourmet burger joint.  The Kiki burger is one of my favorite picks from here.  Kiki burger has juicy angus beef, sautéed Japanese mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and a yummy sweet chili aioli!! Yum! This burger and aioli go so well together.  The buns they use for their burgers are so soft.  

It's also great that they joined the menu of Shoku Ramen next door.  So your gourmet burger and ramen craving can be satisfied all at one place!  Servings of ramen are big! Very filling.  

Tried the Portuguese donuts for dessert.  Very dense donut though.  Raspberry sauce on the side was great along with the coffee ice cream.  

Definitely one of my fave burger joints."}
{"text":"First time ever to Bachi Burger. It was delicious and service was fantastic. We had the oxtail fries (definitely a highly recommend), spicy miso burger (one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had), and than my friend has the crusty crab (also pretty decent). 

About the service, waitress asked of we had any allergies that they should know about. I do not have any, but this is the first time I was ever asked this question. It is a very considerate question to ask. Also, when my friend and I provided our credit cards to pay she asked for our IDs!? It is the little things that count. In a world so full of identity theft I really appreciated this question. 

Amazing food and service. This location is kind of far from my house, but I will be visiting the closer one more frequently now!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger place I have ever enjoyed!  Super delicious burgers! Try the brandy milkshake...its awesome!"}
{"text":"Celebrating the Husband's birthday (two months ago), we were looking for somewhere new that was children-friendly and had a variety of things to order.  Bachi Burger was his place of choice.  I called ahead to make reservations with our large party so that the table would be set up before we get there.  

Once everyone was seated, and drink orders were in place, we got to break down the menu a bit.  Since the Ronin Burger \"Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma,  Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($8) got a lot of praise, the Husband split that along with the Kalbi Burger \"Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo ($8) with his friend. The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share.  The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite.  Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different.  One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger.  He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).

I started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean \"Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil\" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food.  It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy!  It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!

You can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries \"Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli\" ($4).  It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.

Another thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries \"Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($4).  They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.

The kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken \"Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce.\" ($6) that they ordered a second round.

To close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts \"Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato\" ($5) with a birthday candle in it.  (Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.)  They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it.  The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.

Service - we got the waiter that everyone talks about.  He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong.  You can't blame the guy for trying, right?  They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter.  

Overall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread. There were some high points and okay points.

{"text":"Great service!! The Asian spin on burgers were amazing! If you are in Vegas you have to go here!"}
{"text":"So good it will make you want to slap your mother. This is by far my favorite place to get a burger in Las Vegas. The place has gotten so busy since they appeared on Food Network, but the quality is still high.

Last time I was there I ordered pork belly steam buns and truffle parm fries. the Buns are nice and airy and the meat melts right in your mouth. They could of course be bigger for my tastes. The truffle fries are always just a great thing to order for your burger or if some of the appetizers scare you. They has a soft crispness to them and added with the sauce and ketchup they provide really give you a nice experience with them.

Now I have had every burger that they make, but my favorite has to be the Kalbi burger. They marinate it in a nice paste which helps bring out the nice meaty flavor of the burger. The kimchi has a nice crunch and brings more depth to the burger as well."}
{"text":"When will this establishment open in sawtelle (\"Los Angeles\")? I can't wait till I taste that oxtail chilli cheese fries in my mouth again... 

I got the the spicy miso burger... It wasn't spicy... Kind of sad I wanted some kick! However, it wasn't the best burger I had it was ok.. I don't know you must really have to wow me on the burgers for me to love it! I think it's just it's burger or it's just burger lol...

My mom got the bahn mi burger I thought it was better than mine just because I think it had more flavor and more crunch

My dad got kiki's burger ... My first choice since I love mushrooms so much tho he was mean to not share booo so can't tell you what that tastes like...

Since the oxtail chilli cheese fries came as an appetizer I wanted to try the parmesian fries... You know bad mistake!?! I think I was too full too like this plus it felt like poutine instead of parmesian fries! Like I thought it was just going to be fries with parmesian and truffle oil but I didn't think they'd put gravy on it! 

But seriously, when are you coming to LA?"}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries!! (Drops the mic)"}
{"text":"Waited a LONG time for our order to arrive and was missing an entree. The entire table had eaten and the entree still had not arrived. Check dropped- entree still on check even though I asked for it to be taken off. In my opinion this place has potential but is extremely under staffed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we will not be returning to Bachi Burger. The last time we came here for dinner my boyfriend's burger was literally RAW. Both of us lost our appetite and could not believe they actually had someone working in the kitchen that would send out such unacceptable food. 

This experience made us question the level of professionalism and training in the kitchen. Bye bye forever, Bachi."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger you'll ever have. Every time friends of family come to visit I take them to Bachi Burger and 100% of the time they leave saying it's the best burger they've ever had. But burgers aren't the only hit, the oxtail chili crease fries are always a favorite too. I'm not a fan of spicy food at all but there are many things on the menu that are perfect for me which is always a plus when dining with a group given how picky I can be about food. As for the people who like a kick to their food, you'll be in heaven I'm told by my friends who love the heat!"}
{"text":"Best Burger in Vegas
Came here upon one of our visits to Las Vegas, was lucky enough to get in around a 20 minute wait but very worth it. The place is a few miles off the strip, but if you're able to take a cab or uber its very worth it. 

I have only had a few items, from the menu, but I highly recommend trying everything which just means multiple trips to Bachi Burger. 

I hope I am able to visit next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Minimalistic review because I forgot to write it back in July when I went.  The wait to get in was nuts, even though most of the tables were empty.  This made my husband really cranky and we almost left, as we had a movie to catch.

However, the food was good.  We liked the oxtail fries.  I had whichever burger they said was their popular sweet one.  I *think* it was Ronin but I am not 100% sure.  I remember thinking \"IT's a 4\" because I mentally review everything I eat, but I honestly don't remember details.  I do remember that there was another burger I really wanted to try next time I go though (I think it was the banh-mi burger).

It wasn't as good as our local asian fusion burger place (LA Burger in Irving, TX) but it was good and I'd go back."}
{"text":"All I have to say about this place is I had the best hamburger in my entire life when wagyu beef with foie gras totally awesome.Service was good and they had a great beer selection I definitely will be going. back sorry forgot to take pictures also try their truffle fries"}
{"text":"10.14.10

This place is amazing!  If you can venture off the strip and try this place, please do so!

Kiki's Burger:
Two types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, with garlic aioli on the side.  Um, are you hungry yet?"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome food! You have to start with some apps here. The pork belly buns are to die for...can't go wrong with the duck either. If you have more than 2 people with you, try the oxtail fries. All of the burgers are great. Perfectly cooked with a unique Asian fusion spin. But go with he Bahn Mi burger. The combo of shrimp, beef and pork is killer. The Miyaghi burger is wonderful too, as is the one with the Kim Chi. Good beer selection too. 

Service is ok but the food is so killer it doesn't matter. We usually go 3 times a year."}
{"text":"Realistically, I give this place 3.5 stars. The decor is nice and the menu is appealing. They list everything that comes on and with ur orders.... But I felt that it was a tad bit too show-ee for me... Maybe that's what u get in Vegas? Came in based on a recommendation for the oxtail chili fries. That did not disappoint. It was good. A lot of meat, and flavorful. I would say it's a must try if it's your first time. I also had their summer special, the Manga burger. That was OK. A bit too much sauce...couldn't really get too much of the burger flavor. I washed it down with the matcha green tea milk shake. Yum! Maybe I'm spoiled with the burger joints in LA. But Bachi Burger is opening a location on Sawtelle soon. I guess then we can see how they do head to head with the other burger joints out here. That will be fun!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Bachi Burger. They have a nice selection of beers and ciders, however the last time we went there, all the Dogfish Head's were out as well as some other Japanese beer I wanted to try, so that was a bummer, and instead I ordered the same Apple cider I have already had in the past. 

The burgers are yummy. I've tried the Ronin Burger and Kiki's Burger, both were pretty darn de-lish. We've ordered the Jalapeño fries which were friggin' amazing, only weird thing is that both my boyfriend and my mouth were tingling and numb afterwards. It wasn't a bad thing, just completely odd. I sort of liked it though.

The Summerlin location seems to have a bigger and perhaps a better menu, so for dessert we tried the Portuguese donuts (Malasadas) and some almond shake. Both were pretty good, however I will say that I have had better Malasadas, but seeing as those are limited around town, it's whatev."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent... especially for Las Vegas.  There isn't a crazy plethora of burger places here like there are in So. Cal.  

However, its too busy and super disorganized.  Its a poor use of space and the staff isn't trained well enough.  They should learn to maximize use of the space and at least seat people.  They're not the most accommodating so its hard for me to bring people or go back even though I loved the food.  

The service isn't great.  They tend to forget things and they can't seem to keep everything moving.  

I wish I could make this a regular spot because its just as good as umami (which has smaller portion sizes) and stout (with more food options... but much less beer choices) but I won't wait this long just to get a burger.  It would be great to have a bar area or find a way to get people in more quickly."}
{"text":"Was dying for a good burger when I got to Vegas. Looked up popular burgers and this place showed up as a Guy Fieri recommendation. I had a Miyagi-San burger and it was INCREDIBLE. Also had the ox tail chili cheese fries...wow. 

The atmosphere is really chill. Great place for lunch or dinner with reasonably priced food"}
{"text":"I had a meeting down the street, so I was conveniently located right next to Bachi (and I've been meaning to try this spot for nearly six months). Based on photos and the menu description, I wanted to try the spicy miso burger. It is BOMB! I slammed it and would love to go for one more. It's honestly not that spicy but has a small kick that brings a great flavor with the rest of the sauce, fried egg and shishito peppers up in there. Next time I'm bringing a friend to share some Parmesan truffle fries."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing!! Definitely try the Miyagi and Oxtail chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"I had the Ronin burger :))) This is the best burger that I ever ate! I am looking forward to go back to Vegas just for this burger."}
{"text":"Meh. I liked the idea and concept, but it was poorly executed. Service was impeccable. Our server Ray was attentive, and very helpful with suggestions. 

Miyagi San- The Wagyu patty was cooked perfectly. The bun was nice and soft. The onion rings were soggy/oily. All the flavors went together beautifully, but the flavor profile was just TOO SWEET. They put way too much furikake for my liking. A heaping amount of furikake paired with the glaze on the patty made the amount of sweetness overbearing. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- DELICIOUS!! ...but again, TOO SWEET! The chili was too sweet and overpowered the oxtail. They used the sweet white beans like you see in Pork & Beans, and I think that just threw the whole dish off. They could have balanced the flavors better by chopping up the jalapeños and cilantro so all the flavors can come together in each bite. 

Overall, it was nice to try, but I don't see myself coming back. I will stick to Umami Burger and Fuku Burger. Yelp has failed me, yet again."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious, can't go wrong on any item you choose. The downside- service is slow and most times I've come here the \"open bar\" is very limited and lacking even vital mixes for their featured menu drinks. It's also not a very welcoming environment when your waiter is MIA and you've got to search for them just to get your check."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Super juicy and not just average Burgers. I had the kalbi burger that was super flavorful (nice and spicy!) And my boyfriend had the banh mi burger. He ate it super fast so I assume it was really good. The calamari is also really good (although the mint leaves made some pieces taste funny) and the fries were nice and crispy. Close to the rent a car distribution place, so If you're picking up your car I recommend going here! Or go here before you board your flight ."}
{"text":"We had the Shogun burger, salt and pepper garlic fries, and chili fried chicken. 

Shogun burger was just okay. It was very plain, and came with a little plum of some sort which did little to enhance the dish. The flavors were not at all complimentary. There was nothing that stood out about the meal AND you have to order your fries separately.

I ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries because I love garlic and expected the salt and pepper to add a little kick. Ok...there was no garlic but there was a generous amount of ginger, which I really didn't expect. It was also under seasoned with salt and pepper. 

My chili fried chicken was extremely salty. On the salty scale of one to 10, it was at an 8. They were also not as crispy as much as they were soggy and oily. 

Overall I was disappointed. I heard about this place on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives. That being said, I wasn't expecting to be blown away but I certainly expected a decent meal."}
{"text":"Although I'm not usually big on burgers, Bachi Burger takes burger on a whole another level! I got the Miyagi, and it tasted like perfection. The buns were nice and soft, and I love how they added an asian twist to these burgers. In addition to the burgers, the oxtail fries is a must get!! They add a sunny side egg to the fries, which adds a nice creamy texture!"}
{"text":"I have been here around 4 times in the last 3 years. The service use to be really slow but now the service timeliness is very reasonable. Apparently they completed some renovations eight months ago and that probably helped the restaurant become more efficient.

My go to burger is the ronin burger, can't go wrong with that burger. I should probably try other items but why fix something that isn't broken? Also truffle fries are awesome! 

The staff here are very friendly and try to strike up conversations with the customers, that's always pleasant.

All in all, I will come here again. Especially because tourists seem to love it. My cousin Jackie for instance, she claims its the best burger joint ever!."}
{"text":"I struck gold with this place.....I must've come at a  good time because I was seated very quickly and given several menus to decide from what to order. Apparently the two places are owned by the same person so I instantly knew that someone was doing something right. I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered the miso soup. Hell if I know what was in that soup but it was the best after drinking meal I ever had in my life. So good that I had no shame in my game when I picked the bowl up to finish it off.... Prices were adequate with the rest of the restaurants in Vegas, although decor was so so, I spent majority of my time looking at my soup lol. I strongly recommend this little gem."}
{"text":"DDD

Had another great meal at Bachi Burger.  Eight of us went last Sunday night.  Was not too busy and got seated within a few minutes.

Started with both the Duck and Pork Belly buns (divine) and the homemade Japanese pickles, six varieties and always great.

Our party had a variety of the burgers, and everyone enjoyed.  If you really want a well constructed, delicious burger, this is the place!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Positives
- polite, interactive staff.
- large burger menu with crafty burgers with selection of multiple types of meats, no plan hamburger meat here
- very cozy back room, great for personal space for larger groups
- also have extensive Ramen menu

Negative
- the fries are dry and not very flavourful (truffle parmesan fries), except for the sweet potato fries
- asked the waiter for some of the pinapple ketchup and if I would be charged for it, he reported I wouldnt be charged. When the check came I was charged $0.50 for it.
- expensive burgers, cheapest is $11, and just for the burger, not with fries.

Overall, the burger was spectacular and l didnt mine spending the high burger cost for experience. Just wouldn't do it on a regular basis for a burger."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since their opening day and every time I'm in Vegas I make it a  priority to eat here. The food is damn good and the service is hit or miss. I've been here when there as been exceptional customer service and I've been here when my waiter came to our table a total of three times and took 15 mins to get a lemon for my water. 

Lets talk food! Even though I complain sometimes about the service...the taste and texture of the food does help the situation. All their buns have a nice crisp outside and a soft, fresh inside. I'm picky about my buns and these are @DmagicP approved! 

Must have starters:

- Peking Style Duck Steamed Bun (soooo good!)
- Truffle Parmesan Fries
- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries
- Stir Fried, Garlic, Chili Edamame 

Daaaa Buuuuuuurgers:

- Ronin Burger: The Japanese cole slaw, miso dressing, fried egg, and the yuzu citrus aioli make this burger so tasty! It's very flavorful and a simple burger. If you like fried eggs with your traditional burgers, then you will have no problem liking the Ronin.

- Kalbi: It's Kalbi marinated with house made Kim Chee. I just love the taste of marinated Kalbi. The marinated Angus beef is full-bodied with a kick of their house mayo. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection. It almost melts in your mouth. This one is a nice one to have if you've never had Kalbi before. 

-Crusty Crab: If you love crab like I do...then you will enjoy this burger!  I like this one not only because it's crab, but the chutney sauce that is on it. I do like chutney and I've never had it with crab meat before. At first it tasted a little intense for me- the avocado, chutney, and tartar sauce but toward the third bite the mixture of flavors started to kick in and it ended up being very palatable.  

Bachi Fish: This one is probably my least favorite. I do like fish (Alaskan Cod), but something about the mixture of flavors weren't pleasing to my taste buds. I might have to give this one another try. 

Dessert:

- Saigon Cinnamon Bread Pudding w/ Vanilla ice Cream
- Portuguese Donuts w/ Coffee Gelato
- Chocolate Hazelnut Ice Cream Sandwich (Summer Special)


Beverages:

- Apple Lychee Soda 
- Red Velvet Milkshake 
- Strawberry Guava Milkshake
- Watermelon Boba Milk Tea

You have to come here a few times to experience all the delectable items on the menu! Besides the strip clubs, clubbing, girls, and gambling...this is what's on my mind entering Vegas! Enjoy!

{"text":"A very good friend and fellow foodie referred us to Bachi Burger when we told him we were moving to Vegas. We were in town last week to look for housing, and gave them
 a visit.
 Very nice place, clean and new. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Our server was attentive, and professional. 
  We started with the house pickle sampler. Very good flavor, and we strongly recommend you try then. Not what we were expecting, and the variety was perfect.
  We ordered the sweet potato fries, with the citrus aioli, Yummmmm!!! 
  We both decided to order a different burger, and split them. My wife ordered the Ronin burger, I ordered the Kiki burger. The flavors were bold, eclectic and the burger was cooked prefect. Both burgers were outstanding, the portion was filling. 
 We can not wait to return and continue trying different choices. We are returning in a few weeks, and another review to follow. What a great find, and we are so glad to be moving close to this amazing burger find.
 Thank you, Captain Cook for the recommendation!!! We're gonna miss you guys."}
{"text":"YUMMM!!! 

What an excellent burger! 
I think the bun was what made it most excellent...and the delicious caramelized onions. So sweet, I didn't even add any condiments. 

Oh & their fries are superb as well. Truffle Fries win! The sweet potato were a close second though. 

So many wonderful choices...I wish I lived closer so I could try them all. 
I craved it the whole long drive home to LA. I'll HAVE to return. 

( One gripe: The service wasn't top notch...rather slow and unorganized, but once I started eating, it didn't matter anymore.)"}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good, if kind of overpriced.  But that's not why I'm here.
Normally I don't do this, but I had to deduct a star for their awful website.  Loud, obnoxious music coupled with every link being broken.  Every one.  Want to see the menu? Continue listening to the obnoxious music (no off button either!) while the site spins and spins and does nothing.
None of the other links work either. It either immediately goes to an error page or, while you continue to listen to their obnoxious music, just keeps trying to load without doing anything.
A page full of just text would be better.  Plain, black text on a white background. Here are our hours.  Here is our menu. Thanks.
How can you have a bunch of restaurants with more coming and not notice these things.  It's been like this forever."}
{"text":"The food here is always great. My favorite is the Ronin and Kiki burger though you can't go wrong with any of the burgers. You have to order the oxtail fries!!! My least favorite is the banh mi burger.  I've been here at least 10 times and have never been disappointed. However, I've never been satisfied with their  2-star service. It started with the hostess who seems upset we showed up. Not even a smile or a greeting. Whenever we go there, the servers always look unhappy.......maybe they should quit and find a happier place to work at. Otherwise, this would have been a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Best Asian fusion burgers in Las Vegas hands down. Unique flavors that has your mouth dancing with joy. The truffle fries was super delicious and so was the pork buns. Shogun burger is the the best but every other burger here is to die for. Also the lava cake is mouth watering. The service is impeccable and our server Dan was a delight. He should get a raise!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! Seriously, amazing burgers. Creative toppings, awesome sides. They pork belly buns were super tasty too, next time trying the oxtail fries!"}
{"text":"Joel wanted a burger for lunch and I just wanted lunch. We finally agreed on Bachi Burger.
Since it was lunch time it was pretty packed. We only waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. This was our first time here and I noticed they merged with the ramen restaurant next door. Very cool! We looked over the menu and I immediately saw they offered bao sandwiches!! They offered my favorite kind too! The peaking duck bao. Joel ordered Kiki's burger and we shared the truffle parmesan fries. 

The fries came out first! They were thin cut, crispy and came drizzled with truffle sauce  over them. I also ordered a side of garlic chili sauce to dip them in. Yum! Next came Joel's burger and my duck bao. Joel's burger was messy!!! It had lots of shiitake mushrooms, a slice of gruyere cheese and a thick juice burger patty. By the time he finished I felt like I needed to hose him down he was so covered in burger and sauce. My bao was tender and the meat was flavorful. It also had a thin slice of egg and radish and came with a side of hoisn sauce. That complimented the bao nicely. 

The service was prompt and friendly. I always love when places pay attention and refill my water glass when empty. The Bachi Burger staff fit the bill. The waiter even quickly brought napkins when Joel was messy. 

The decor is basic. The wooden benches and chairs are not comfy. They also have a bar you can sit at, but those high chairs didn't look any more comfy. 

I think it's great the Bachi has merged with the next door ramen spot. It lets them offer more options and a larger dining place. On the price it is a little expensive. ($3 for a soda. I'll stick with water.) 

Bachi Burger was tasty, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"After my friend had been super excited and raving about this place, I was disappointed that it's really not that great for vegetarians or vegans. The burger I got just didn't have a tasty flavor. Just kind of sour and sickly sweet. I actually got sick of eating it and stopped..which HARDLY EVER happens to me."}
{"text":"This place will probably be a one time thing for me.  Tried it, been there, done that, no need to go again.  Bachi burger is a fusion gourmet burger restaurant that also serves breakfast all day. They charge $$ for a burger because their meats are better in quality: ribeye angus and wagyu.  But beef is beef when it's all ground up. I certainly didn't taste the difference. My friend ordered medium rare, another friend medium and I ordered it cooked medium well. When they came out all of them was medium well so it's not like they do a great job of cooking it to your preference. 

I got the spicy miso burger and my friend got the Kiki burger. Yes our burgers were juicy and relatively decent sized but it's really not worth the price. The ingredients in my burger.. Miso paste, gochugang, egg, lettuce, didn't really seem that special to me. I liked the Kiki burger for the mushrooms though. 

We also ordered the oxtail fries. It was a big portion of fries but they skimped on the meat and the spicy garlic sauce. When I asked for more sauce they wanted to charge me :(. 

If you're into fancy fusion burgers where the burgers are slightly sweet, slightly spicy then this could be your jam. However this place isn't for me."}
{"text":"When it comes to the food, believe the hype. It's fabulous. I had the Miyagi-san burger and salt and pepper fries and could not find one thing outside of perfect. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that service a wee bit on the slow side. Took quite a while for someone to come to our table and then we never got a drink refill till it was time for the check."}
{"text":"I have visited Bachi burger 20+ times and always get cravings for it. There is not 1 thing on the menu that is not 5*s. I strongly suggest the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries, the Bachi Caesar, Kiki burger, or the Ronin burger."}
{"text":"Trying out the place and  I had the bao duck  with the bone marrow my partner  has the pork bao with chili fries it's awesome service it great too will come back when in town"}
{"text":"When is Bachi Burger not good? This particular location was pretty slow unlike the Bachi Burger in Henderson which always has a wait.  My wife and Iove the burgers here and the truffle fries are fantastic as well. Oxtail fries are a bit rich, but still tasty. 

Why waste your time driving to the strip and paying for parking (damn MGM and Caesars) to go to places like Holstein, Gordan Ramsay BurGR and Burger Bar... when Bachi Burger has 3 locations (Summerlin, Henderson and Southwest).

Skip the glam and get great burgers in town with half the cost!"}
{"text":"Bahn mi burger was a nice surprise. The bun was fluffy and soft with pate. Shrimp with the burger and a slice of grilled pork. I didn't care much for the dipping sauce and thought it didn't need it. I ordered the fried rice for my youngest. He liked it but thought it wAs a little spicy. I ordered the pork rice ball. He enjoyed that a lot. 
My husband ordered the MiYagi with fried onion rings, egg, garlic aioli served on a soft bun. He thought that it was great. My older son ordered the tonkatsu ramen and he slurped that right up. We ended our night with the chocolate cake and caramel salt milk shake. Both were ok. I thought that the cake would ooze out a bit but no luck. 
I los ordered the plantation ice tea and had them add boba. Got my boba fix after all. I would recommend you give this a try."}
{"text":"Great staff, yummy burgers. Not a place to go to if you're in a rush, there was a wait to be seated when I went."}
{"text":"Always spot on.

GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES!  They are the best you will ever have.

Veggie burger without the patty and subbed with more tofu is top notch.

Always great service as well.

Thank you."}
{"text":"Having a great first time around we had to stop on our way through Vegas.

Again we were amazed! 

Love the wagyu meats. Period."}
{"text":"Had the Banh Mi burger here and it was so so good. 

They put like 8 diff types of meat into 1 patty, (pork, beef, pate, shrimp...I can't remember the rest), add some tasty lettuce, picked dikon and radish, and give you a sweet dipping sauce on the side.  The patty was succulent and a great combination with the fluffy, soft bun...  had the tasty flavors of banh mi with the best parts of a burger (big bun, juicy patty) 

Everything great fusion should be. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Oxtail chili cheese fries were the real deal, but what a heavy dish.  Combining the space with the ramen place next door means you can choose from both menus.  They accommodated our party of 16 in the late afternoon.  I heard the bnah mi burger was amazing from others in our group."}
{"text":"The food was pretty impressive but the management needs to staff more people here.  There were only 5 people working this evening and customers were standing at the \"Please wait to be seated sign\" for at least 20 minutes.  The staff should at least seat people instead of letting us stand there unacknowledged.  Multiple parties waiting left unhappy but we decided to stick it out.

Even with the kitchen and staff backed up, the food came out in a decent amount of time though.  Here is what we ordered:

1) Kiki's Burger - I love the mushroom and aioli flavors paired with the gruyere cheese and caramelized bacon.

2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - I loved everything about these fries!  The oxtail was so juicy and the fried egg on top was a great addition!

It was worth the try!  I'm sad a lot of the California locations have closed but it was worth visiting it this trip!"}
{"text":"They were shut down by the health department for having roaches. They've reopened, but this is something that you only get one strike with in my book.

{"text":"Wow!

That was a great brunch. Picked this place on a whim and was blown away by the quality of the food and variety.

The one down side for brunch is that their coffee needs improvement but I'm not taking away a star from that."}
{"text":"I've always liked to bring my friends and family from out of town here but it's just not worth it anymore. There is always a wait. The food is good and but service is slow. Being there's always a wait I understand. But add the price along with having to wait around. Not worth it. Suggestions if you wait. Go next door to the lions tavern and get a beer while you wait."}
{"text":"Wednesday at 7pm, surprisingly not busy. It was good service and great food. I ordered the Ronin. It was as amazing as previous reviews stated.  Only reason for a 4 star is the upwell. The waitress I had, while purdy as she was, tried to upwell fries and drinks.  I respect that from a restaurant, but only if I ask your recommendation. If I order xxx beer and xxx fries, bring me those."}
{"text":"We were meeting my wife's friend out here for lunch today and here's what we each got:

Ronin burger & sea salt fries with pineapple ketchup!!!! (wife)
Kalbi Burger & Garlic Pepper Fries (me)
Green and Black & Truffle Fries (friend)

I liked the Kalbi Burger which is basically a Korean flavored burger with kim chi.  I had a taste of my wife's burger too and it was also on point!!!    Some people might not like this place, but I thought it was awesome.    I don't normally eat burgers that often besides In N Out, and I thought the burger here was delicious.

Service was on point and got my h2o refilled consistently.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY got the opportunity to check this place out!!!  As a passionate Yelper, I don't know why it took me sooo long to visit a place with over 1000 reviews with an overall rating of 4 stars.  To me, that sounds like a GREAT place.  A good friend called me to go to dinner and this place was a great choice.  I was stoked!

When we arrived, I found out the wait was 35-40 minutes which didn't bother me because it told me this place was popular.  The waiting area was a little small with not a lot of seating.  I was relieved to see that the employees were really quick about cleaning off tables once diners left so we weren't waiting very long.  Our party saw an area at the bar and decided to just sit there.  Total wait time, around 15 minutes :)

The place is a nice, quaint venue.  You have the exposed air ducts and lighting.  The walls were painted grey to look like concrete walls.  The overall feeling was a warehouse/loft look which ultimately made for a modern feel.  I love it!  The bar top was filled with very comfy stools, dark top with an opaque glass wall with different colors illuminating the bar:  purples, greens and blues.  

When we first sat down, the bar top was not clean had a fishy egg smell to it. We ended up asking the hostess to wipe it off. BTW, the hostess, was soo sweet!  From the greeting to the dinner service, she was super attentive and really helped her servers out.  Top notch!  The bar server was also a cool guy.  I think he was definitely in a managerial role, he just had that aura about him.  I felt like he was from Hawaii.  He kept using \"brah\" when he talked to me, which made it feel like a family place!  Alright, onto the food!

We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries for 11.50. I saw this dish featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and NEEDED to try it!  First of all, what an amazing and beautiful dish.  Start off with crispy shoe string fries, chili filled with shredded oxtail meat, topped with a garlic aioli, cilantro, sliced jalapeños and a  fried sunny-side egg. WOW, I'm in heaven.  This dish is savory, little spicy from the chili and jalapeños, packed with flavor. When you get this dish, you must first take a photo for Facebook, then break the egg yolk and mix everything together.  The yolk coats the chili and fries and brings the dish to a whole new level!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish :)

For our main course, we decided to get two different burgers, cut them in half and share them, so we could asses more than just one!  The first burger was the Ronin burger for $11. This burger was Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, topped with a katsu bbq sauce, miso type dressing and accompanied with a Yuzu citrus aioli.  This burger is my favorite of the two we tried tonight.  The burger was super juicy (make sure you get it medium done...only way to go!), the slaw offered a crunchy texture, enhancing the burger, love me some fried eggs in a burger so there's that.  The sauces really brought the dish together.  SOOO Good!  The second burger was got was the Kiki burger also for $11.  This burger is also made with a juicy patty of Angus beef.  What enhanced the burger were the sauteed mushrooms:  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii.  The burger also had caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, onion marmalade, arugula and accompanied with a garlic chili aioli.  What I noticed right off the bat was the super smokey taste of the burger!!!  Then you get a sweet kick from the marmalade.  This burger is packed with different textures:  crunchy arugula and dense chunks of mushrooms.  The garlic chili aioli really makes the burger a star, so do forget to use it!  All these burgers are held together by a Taiwanese sweet bread, super light and fluffy.  Soo good!

So I know my review was super long.  If you are one of the few folks that reads this entire review and finds it through the 1000+ reviews, I'm hoping that you're mouth is watering like a faucet.  You NEEED to get your butt down to Bachi burger and try their food.  This place is absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret it.  So what are you waiting for??  They're open late!!"}
{"text":"While I hear their burgers are divine and one of the best burgers ever, I can only review the pork belly steamed buns and chili fries. I couldn't get a burger because I just had a burger 2 hours before. Dammit!

Regardless, the pork belly buns? Delicious. So tender but at that point I was so full, I had to stuff the last one down. But the point is, I was willing to make the sacrifice.

I'm not a big fan of beans so you can guess how the chili fries went for me. I can see how they'd be interesting for fans of beans though.

One thing about this place is your entire party has to be there to be seated which is kind of lame.

Other than that, service is pretty good and the line isn't too bad considering this is the one further from the strip."}
{"text":"Visited this place from a referral from my brother and sister-in-law. It's a solid 4 for the time put into their food.

The ronin and kiki were flavorful. A bit sweet for my taste buds, but you can taste each ingredient. I thought the meat was cooked perfectly, yet the highlight for me was the garlic and sea salt fries. I love skinny fries and they even sprinkled it with a bit of chopped jalapenos. 

I can see why this place is busy. My only complaint is that it's a little pricey and the food takes time to come out. A good gourmet burger if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bachi burger!!! I love it cause it has the ramen place with it as well... It's kinda like a 2 for 1 win hahah

The restaurant itself is very chic and cute. Our waters are always refilled and the staff are very friendly! The service is always a hit or miss because I have had a different server the 5 times I've been here.

Their food has been perfect every time. I love the kiki, ronin, and the spicy miso burger, they're a faveeeee :)))) I will never go to another bachi except this one and village square, the jones location sucks in service and food and serves soggy burgers!!! Please visit this amazing location on windmill :)"}
{"text":"I decided to update my review because I got to dine in...and wanted to give this bachi location a second chance. The service still sucks and my burger was STILL soggy after two minutes hahahha. Our truffle fries were soggy too soooo we just left them. Ugh I am definitely giving all hope on this location and just going to the windmill and Sahara locations :( 

Our waters were never filled, and it took them 10 minutes to seat me in an empty restaurant.... The food took forever and when we got it, it was soaked in grease and oil and sauce so I had to remove the buns in order to eat it."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Best burger ever (foie gras and wagyu beef? YES, thank you!), service was kind of hipster, but very pleasant. Cool interior. Nice beer list and just all around great fusion concept"}
{"text":"After a day of slingin cookies for Rise Up Japan, I needed some fuel. I am rarely on this side of town and this has been on the list of curiosities for a while.

The BF and I shared:

Ronin ($8,Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli) - from the description, you can clearly see there was a lot going on. Somehow it worked for me but I think it's because those are familiar flavors I would find in a bento lunch but I know for some folks this won't work. It was very rich  specially when you're biting through the egg yolk area. You didn't need the yuzu aioli sauce served on the side (I ended up dipping fries in it). Both the BF and I were glad we split since neither of us can really eat a whole of that flavor. 

KiKi ($8, Sautéed Shiitake & Eryngi mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Ciabatta Bun, Garlic Chili Aioli on the side ) I love me mushroom and onion burgers and happy that they were generous on the onions and mushrooms in it. I did use the chili aioli to add a bit of zing to it to balance the rich earthiness and sweetness of the toppings.

Truffle Fries ($4)- they drizzle a bit of truffle gravy on the fries but I wish they just give you that on the side. The fries were crisp and light and well seasoned. 

They had a bunch of different drinks and I respect their nicely selected craft beers, but I was just feeling on a simple and refreshing matcha ice green tea. 

Overall, service was friendly and decent with keeping up on the drinks. 

I liked the sweet bun on the burger. I thought the meat was good quality, juicy and cooked right. I think the concept is good and I am curious to try more of their offerings. However, I don't think I would drive all the way from the NW to come down to eat here. If we're in Town Square I think this will be something I'd much rather go to instead of eating in the mall."}
{"text":"Came with the BF and Angela H. for lunch. I went to the OG location quite a while back and liked it, but it is just out of the way for us.  

The BF and I went to a place with the name burger in it, and didn't get burgers. Hah. 

We shared two items that I believe are new to the menu: 

Fish and Chips - these were pretty good. I don't know what kind of fish was used but it seemed denser of a fish than what is in usual and they batter it with a shiso leaf. The tartar sauce had nice zest to it. The chips are their usual fries which is a bit skinny and not the thick kind of British chips. 

Lobster roll - the lobster salad had some curry flavor to it and was really a great twist! They serve it on a bahn mi like baguette which was decent, but like some other reviewer said previously, they were hoping for the same soft buns used with the burger and I agree that would be aces. I'm just used to lobster rolls don't go in crunchy rolls but soft buttery ones. These come with \"root chips\" which remind me of those Terra chips. 

Salt and Pepper Fries for the table - these were nice. it had jalapenos in it and the seasoning I can't quite place that added more spice to the fries and the chili aioli was nice. I liked these and ended up polishing off the rest instead of my chips. 

Angela got a Lonely Bird which she reported was good, though the onion strings were a tad salty.  

Also a plus is the matcha iced tea! I love tea but sometimes I get tired of the standard ice tea offered at most places. Other than the green, there were a few other tea flavors that I don't think is refillable. I'm a beer person and it is definitely nice to see some respectable craft beer choices. 

Service was pretty decent and filled my drink a few times, but just fairly standard. 

Bachi is definitely a welcomed addition to the West and I definitely come back for other offerings."}
{"text":"Mouth watering burgers cooked to perfection. I had the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. The egg yolk dripping down the side of my burger was the finishing touch to this flavorful masterpiece. The parmesan cheese fries on the other hand, were anything but amazing. Had I known they were going to be lacking in flavor, I would have ordered them original with a side of ketchup. The waitress was attentive and not in the fill your glass of water every 5 seconds kind of way... We all know how annoying that can be!
I will definitely go back as soon as I can. I will continue experimenting with all the different burgers in search for the best one. Any place that makes eating a \"burger\" an amazing experience is my kind of place. Be prepared to unbutton your jeans/pants when exiting this establishment."}
{"text":"Watching food porn before bed can be as dangerous as going to the grocery store hungry.  About a year ago while watching Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, they visited Bachi Burger.  Now i live in Canada, and i was close to debating a road trip, just to have some of those chili fries.  While planning a recent trip to Vegas, i remembered Bachi, and immediately put that on the itinerary.  They have two locations, we went to the newer one, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  I didn't have to look at the menu, i had it planned months ago what i was going to order, the oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and a fried egg a top.    It came to the table and it was everything that i wanted.  The fries, even with all of the toppings remained surprising crisp, and the gravy was more of a ragu, and it was rich and delicious.  The problem with restaurants being on TV is that they will showcase a few dishes.  Now coming from another country you want to try as many dishes as possible, especially the burgers.  At Bachi they have sliders, so it would be nice if they could make the fries in a smaller size, so that you can try a burger as well.  My sister ordered the kiki, which they made on DDD's, and she gave me one bite, and it was my biggest food regret from that trip of not ordering a burger because i was so full from the fries.  
Overall, it is a very basic strip mall restaurant from the outside, but where they knock your socks off is in the flavour department.  They are not shy, their food is bold, and i cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE PLACE I WILL FOREVER KNOW AS THE BEST TASTING BURGER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE(no exaggeration). I had the Kiki burger with angus beef, shiitake&eryngii mushroom, enoki onion marinade, gruuere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. I also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries. The burger was unforgettable. I wish I could had taken 2 or 3 to go. The fries were decent. Nothing really spectacular and they cost almost as much as the burger themself. The main downside of why I couldn't give this location 5 stars is because of the service. It took approximately 20 minutes for our waitress to take our DRINK ORDER, not food, and then about another 20 minutes to give us our check after we had asked for it. Otherwise I would totally recommend this place for the delicious and great pricing burgers."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had never tried this place out, we were craving a burger so we ordered for pick up. After waiting an hour for the food one of the burgers had cheese on it when I specifically told them TWICE no cheese. I spoke to the manager I think his name was Mark? and he was very nonchalant about the whole thing. He didn't even act like it was a big deal; it was a big deal because we threw the burger away. I initially asked to get a credit for the burger they never offered by the way, but after hearing how unconcerned he was we will not be going back. He seemed annoyed with me more than anything. Rude."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in town. Stop wasting your time looking and head here. The burgers are cooked perfectly, the buns are the best (I usually use that phrase in different context!), the fries come a la carte and all options are great. I would recommend trying the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. You'd never know it's ox tail, trust me. I wouldn't eat ox tail in any other situation but I gave these a try and almost licked the plate clean. It starts off sweet with a little kick at the end, just try it! I don't venture off too far into the options of burgers but they have Asian Fusion styles and they all look good, just not for me. 

Tip - call ahead and check the wait. They have a Summerlin location that has more room if it's busy."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas! The buns are super soft and the unique asian style flavor combinations are to die for. I've been here numerous time and have never had a bad experience.  I also try a different burger on every visit and have not been let down once.  

The burgers are large and very filling but I say splurge and get yourself an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries as well because they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love it here.  It's one of my favorite burger places, especially good because of the asian inspiration they inject into each of the burgers.  The food, mixed with the atmosphere and friendly wait staff make it a good experience.  

My favorite thing to get here is the Kiki's burger.  Absolutely delicious.  I love everything about this burger.  The meat is always juicy, it has onions (good!), bacon (better!), cheese (best!), and this aioli dressing that is fantastic.  About once a month, I get a sudden craving for this burger and have to go back.

The kalbi burger is also something that should be probably be noted.  It's not just a burger with some kimchee on it or something.  The meat has so much flavor infused into it.  Very good, thumbs up.

I love the buns they put the burger on as well.  Its those buns that you can find in china town that's super soft and kind of sweet?  Even my cousin who said he despises those buns said it was good.

I always get the truffle parm fries.  In my opinion, its best NOT to share these.  Get your own!  =)

At about 8 bucks a burger and 4 bucks for the fries, its reasonably priced and well worth it.  I'll be back next month when my Kiki's burger craving comes back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, it was my first time here. I'll be back to check out the oxtail chili cheese fries, they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I tested this place out for a quick bite to eat. The menu is centered around burgers, who would of guessed with such a name. They do have unique items such as banh mi sliders and dry rub chicken wings. I had \"Kiki's Burger\" and it was tasty. My favorite thing was the bun, extremely soft and a nice change from a regular hamburger bun. My only gripe is that the burgers come a la carte. Fries and an additional charge. Good burger but for the price you can find a better one that includes a side of fries."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious Ramen with Pork.  Started off with Truffle Fries a delight.  Great atmosphere and the best thing is their burgers are tasty tasty.  Everyone is happy."}
{"text":"The other location of Bachi Burger is definitely better, but there are a few things about this location that you should know! :) 

Ambiance: 4 - Organized, Clean. Not too many people during the nighttime. 

Service: 3 - Our server was funny and really kind, but they were too slow with everything after we were done eating, such as the check and getting boxes. Took way too much time than it should have!! 

Food: 3 - Some tips! 

(1) If you're not getting a grass-fed burger, you really should. You can taste the difference, and to me, the regular is just...yuck! I realized I should have payed $16 for the grass-fed beef. 
(2) The fries are good, and the quickest thing on the menu! I suggest the truffle fries and the regular fries with the pineapple ketchup..I'm gonna start doing that to my ketchup whenever I have fries at home! 
(3) My burger favorite is Miyagi san's Grass-Fed Wagyu burger. One word: Delish. 

In all, I suggest the other location of Bachi Burger for a more pleasant experience, but if all you want is Miyagi and fries--this location isn't half bad!!"}
{"text":"These burgers are juicy, cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. Burgers never tasted better & service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times and it has always been great but came here 2 weeks ago and the service was horrendous. Being that it was a Saturday night and the place was maybe 80% full, that's not a good sign. I may give it one more shot, but very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to get around to trying this place out ever since I saw it on TV. The timing was never right...until now. I have to thank my two friends, Rob & Steph, who finally got me that elusive visit to Bachi!
It's not located too far from the strip. But definitely an area I had never even traveled, even living here 7 years. Inside, it had a nice clean, look. They were fairly busy for lunch, but the wait wasn't terribly long, 15-20min.
There was 3 or 4 burgers I wanted to try but I suppose I'll have to return to try them all hehe. I decided on the Spicy Miso Burger. I believe my friends had the Bahn-Mi & Wagyu cheeseburger. We also shared the oxtail chili cheese & truffle parm fries. My burger contained onions, shishito peppers, roasted garlic, swiss cheese, apple vinaigrette, a fried egg and spicy miso sauce. I loved the sauce. Little spicy, the subtle savory flavor of miso. And can't argue with a fried egg on any burger or sandwich, at least I wouldn't haha. Great burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries were also awesome, although it did cost twice as much as the other fries. The truffle parm fries I couldn't really taste any truffle. The Ramsay burGR truffle parm fries were definitely alot better.
Service was good from start to finish. I absolutely have to return to try more of their burgers!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger joint!! We had a party of 5 this past weekend. I really didn't like how they gave us a small table for 5 instead of combining one more table for us so we can sit comfortably. We ordered alot of food but no space to put it. 

[+] Ronin burger..yummm
[+] Kiki burger...mine was a little over cooked, but I like how they have shitake in my burger. I also like their buns. Its very \"asian market\" style buns.
[+] Pork belly steam buns...soooo fatty and yummy
[+] Oxtail chili fries + Egg....must get ....it is sooo good
[+] Edamame with ginger, garlic, chili....one of the best edamame I've ever tasted...perfection!
[+] Kalbi burger...soo good
[+] Truffle parmesan fries are good..but get the oxtail instead...so much better!
[+] Lychee milk tea..refreshing!

[-] Banh mi burger...go get a real vietnamese banh mi instead. 
[-] Fries with pineapple ketchup...its nothing special...and there wasn't enough pineapple taste in the ketchup. It taste like regular fries with regular ketchup with a pinch of pineapple juice. 
[-] Strawberry milk tea..taste fake/wierd. 

I will definitely hit Bachi Burger up the next time I go to Vegas! Our bill was a little pricey but some of the items on the menu are sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Burger place for foodies!!!

My friend who lives in Vegas brought me here last weekend and I could not have chosen a better lunch spot. After a few days of all you can eat buffets and high priced restaurants, Bachi Burger was a very nice change of pace. I heard this was the best burger place in Vegas. I knew I had to try it. Here's my take:

What I recommend: If you love blue cheese as much as I do, go with the Black & Green. I have no idea why they don't call it the Black & Blue. I ordered medium rare and it was delicious! It's a great burger. The burger patty if flavorful in itself, but with the mushrooms, bacon and spinach- I enjoyed it very much. One thing that I really liked about the Black & Blue is that the burger is not overwhelmed with the blue cheese. I would say it's in every other bite. Pretty smart if you ask me. Be sure to get the Parmesan garlic fries. Wash it down with a good beer. You'll be glad you did. 

If blue cheese is not for you, try the kiki burger. Different cheese, different tastes, but equally amazing."}
{"text":"Their burger was amazing.  We had the pork belly and duck bun, oxtail chili fries, and Miyagi'd burger. The food we ordered were yummy and very satisfying. Portion was good for the price you pay. Service was good as well, our waiter always check up on us and made sure our glasses are always full."}
{"text":"By far the best burger I have ever had. Its a hidden gem that everyone needs to visit."}
{"text":"Food is great.... Then they ruin it with the horrible service, and crazy \" policies \". Just one example...They ruined a very large order because they didn't make it..  I called in a very large order of steam buns that I was bringing to a party, I asked the girl on the phone if she needed my credit card when I was placing the order ... No , she said... When I went to pick it up.. They didn't make it because they said their policy was that all orders needed a credit card before they would make it. Really! Tell your staff then, cause I tried to pay on the phone ! No apologies, nothing! They are very full of themselves. The food is good but it doesn't make up for the hassle of trying to eat here. Always something from these folks.. Shame cause I like the food...:("}
{"text":"Steve the Supervisor was hella dope. He was so kind to us and to top it off we love the food here. Order the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen, Angus Burger, and Garlic fries. You won't regret it! Thank you Steve!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a work trip to Vegas. A co-worker had heard nothing but good things and after looking the place up it sounded like a good idea. 

The place had a few open tables but the lack of servers/service made seating take alot longer than it really should have, and honestly the service was even spotty once we got seated.

The food we got made up for it all tho. I ordered \"Miyagi-san Grass Feed Wagyu Burger  with Salt and Pepper fries. Both were excellent and delicious. I loved the jalapeno touch they added to the fries.  

Co-Workers ordered sweet potatoes fries which were excellent along with a Black and Green burger and rissoto wagyu burger. The both also enjoyed their meals.

I would absolutely come back. Even with the spotty service it was good enough to where I would like to come try some other their other burgers. Price point is basically $20 a head if you're not drinking."}
{"text":"Decided to go off the strip to eat with my family. I love trying new food like this place. The food was so tasty! I ordered the shogun burger and was not disappointed. I also suggest the moco loco which my mom had and it was great as well. 

My only draw back from this place is the food and service took forever. I think our server was new so she didn't really have the hang of asking people what they need and taking their orders in a timely matter. 

I was excited about the chili fries because that's what really sold me on coming to this place but unfortunately we never got them. We had gotten all our food (not all at once though) and kept asking the servers about our fries. But we couldn't wait any longer. We ate our food and had to cancel the order because we wanted to eat the fries with our burgers.
Luckily the manager or owner came around to ask how everything was and we had to tell him we never got our fries and to cancel the order.  He was very nice about it and also very apologetic. Kinda nice they didn't come because we were pretty full! 

Other than that the food was great!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but the wait time was not.
Granted we came on a Friday around 7pm; 25min wait for 2 even though there were several empty tables.
While we were waiting we already decided what we wanted, but even then it took a while before a waiter got to us after we were seated.
Beer took 20 min to arrive and was comped;
Burgers took another 15min;
Another 20 min after we finished the burgers we tried to cancel the dessert which was ordered initially and then it magically appeared.  It was boxed to go and was also comped.
Overall we spent 1:30min which is ridiculous for 2 people at a burger joint.
I don't know what their problem was, whether it was a lack of waiters (3) or if their kitchen couldn't handle the capacity. I wouldn't come here on a weekend ever again."}
{"text":"Well just by reviewing some of the reviews mine wont be any different. First the good news: As far a flavor Bachi Burger is definitely a hit. If you you wanna try a \"non-conventional\" American Burger this place holds true flavor. I've personally order the black & green burger and it was delicious. You can taste all the flavors described. I've added gruyere cheese which was good also. Now the service: Service I will give 1.5/5 on this one. List: 10mins to be seated, another 10mins to be greeted and order. 15mins to be servers my drink. 15mins later my fries come out , then another 10mins finally the burger. All together it took about 50 mins from arrival to eating. Oh and I only sat by myself with no parties. I can understand food needs time to cook to order, but I shouldn't have to wait 30 mins to finally be served a drink. I think that's kinda ridiculous for the amount of time to wait. I thinks it's really the lack of communication of the servers of the floor. One guy kept repeating \"I need all staff on the floor\" and no one seems to care. It looked like they were trying to look like the busy instead of tending to their customers. What a shame. Overall the experience needs some improvement. Food quality 5/5, Service 1.5/5 Overall 3/5. Sorry bout I hope the location on Russell has better service then this one."}
{"text":"The Best Burger joint in Vegas!!! This place was such a treat for my friends and I. And for the first time experience a burger place with an Asian taste! My ordered was Peking style Duck steamed buns, Mr HO's burger and Truffle Fries. We couldn't resist ordering Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries after seeing the table next to us ordering it. By far one of the most flavorful burger experience!!! I can't wait to come back to Vegas and have lunch here again!!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday evening about 9pm.  The tables were full, but they were able to seat us immediately.  We went HAMmer on the menu.  We got calamari, wings, garlic fries, oxtail fries, oreo shake, and the shogun burger.  

Ok, I had the burger, and it was totally worth the 26 bucks.  The wagyu was tender, and it was just a whole lot of fatty goodness. It was maybe on the sweet side, but it was fine by me.  Good balance of flavor.  I'm coming back to try more stuff"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is really burgerlicious! Be warned the amount of MSG is so freaking high it made me dizzy. well at least i assumed it was MSG.. not sure... I guess if your sensitive to MSG like myself you might end up on the floor.lol. But the two times ive been there i would feel it.

My recent visit to bachi burger was during the busy dinner hours.. The waiters were all busy and it took forever to get just a drink order , and the waitress took forever to take our orders, but it's okay just make sure you are aware during the busy dinner hours you will have slow service.. This was fine with me because I was conducting a business transaction dinner..

For drinks I ordered the green tea, it was really a drink that quenched your thirst.  Add a pack of sweet n low for those of you who love your teas sweet..

For starters I ordered the Oxtail chili cheese fries. I highly suggest you trying this.. One of my favorite starters here..

For our burgers we ordered;

The famous Miyagi burger medium on the meat. - This burger is topped with a sweet bun in the inside it came with friend breaded onions, egg, the burger sprinkled with furikake mix. SUPER BOMB!!!!

I also had the the privileged to taste half of my associates burger he ordered the Kalbi burger which if i remembered consisted of lettuce and kimchi and kalbi burger. Really good as well but i still prefer the Miyagi over the kalbi burger.

For french fries we ordered a side of truffled parmigian fries, which came with a special sauce. i highly recommend this as well.

Even thou service was slow during dinner time i still give this place a 5 star, during lunch service is better. I'm not sure if it was my waitress at the time , that made the service slow.. but hey im not complaining, i still love this place! going again once a friend of mine arrives from hawaii! :)"}
{"text":"On Tue/30 Apr my 2 friends (a couple) and I ate here at approx 8:15 pm:
- I had the $7.50 Bachi Burger made with Angus beef and it was excellent.  I had wanted the Mr. Ho's Burger but the server said that's a popular item and they were out of it at that time.
- My friends enjoyed their Spicy Miso Burger (they split it), the Sweet Potato Fries and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  They graciously shared both types of fries with me and they were pretty good.
- Service is quick and attentive.  I drink lots of free ice water and the servers refilled my glass about 6 times."}
{"text":"So here goes my first review since I moved back to Vegas..... Bachi Burger failed to impress me the first time I was here almost 2 years ago. I was staying with a friend the other day who lived nearby and we decided to go here for a late night dinner.

I was extremely happy I decided to give this place another try. The food is amazing and the service was excellent. My buddy already went back last night to pick up food to go. I ordered the truffled parmasean garlic fries and the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. My friend ordered the Chili Fried Chicken and Kiki's Burger. No complaints about any of the food. I was surprised at how good the Fried Chicken was. I wasn't a fan of the sauce served with the fries, but not a big deal.

The reason I don't give them 5 stars just yet is I'm still a bit disappointed in the length of time it takes for the food to come out when there is nobody else in the restaurant. It was much quicker than the first time I went (took 50 minutes then). But I guess good food is worth waiting for. Also, I still think they could improve the atmosphere of the place a bit. It still feels like a strange cross between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant when they could be so much more. With food that good its a shame they are not busy all the time. Maybe it's the location, maybe its the atmosphere... I'm not sure.

Anyway, I look forward to going back to try more delicious burgers! Hopefully I can bump this up to 5 stars in the future. Another plus was that the manager had reached out to me and apologized for my poor experience the first time around. That was probably the main reason I gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"Bachi, bachi, bachi.... my how you have grown on me since you first opened. After my horrible service experience when the original Bachi opened a few years back, I have turned into a huge fan that raves about this place to everyone. There's a really good chance that if you are coming to visit me in Vegas, you will be going to Bachi Burger. My favorite is the Miyagi-San burger. About as perfect of a burger as I have ever had and blows away anything else in Vegas at that price point. I mean, honestly you can get an amazing burger at Bachi for about twice the price of a Carl's Jr burger and won't feel like you know what after you eat it.

If you haven't been to Bachi yet, you are missing out. I like the decor and atmosphere of this location a bit more than the original. Don't like that I live pretty much right in the middle of both of them and it takes about 15 minutes or so to get to either of them. Can't they open up next door to my place??? I promise I'll come at least once or twice a week!!! Pretty please!!!"}
{"text":"More than a review this a request or better yet a plead, dear Bachi owner please open a Bachi restaurant in Portland, it has been more than 6 months since I moved from Las Vegas and I can not find a decent burger that vaguely resembles the taste of the Ronin, the Kiki, or the Miyagi San, I truly believe that Bachi had ruined any burger I may try, because all the time me an my family are comparing it to your Burgers!

Hoping to see Bachi around in Portland! otherwise I may need to seriously consider becoming a VEGETARIAN..."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for lunch on our way home from Utah yesterday. We specifically went here after seeing it on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives not long ago. 

Last start with the service. She was in training and did a solid job. She gets full stars.

We ordered the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. The flavor was fantastic, but he sprouts needed about 2-3 more minutes steaming. They where very hard. 2 stars for this. 

Then we ordered the Kiki Burger (wife) and I got the Bhan Mi Burger. Her medium cooked burger was way pink inside. Not medium at all. That was the only problem with hers. My burger was Med Rare and absolutely AWESOME! Seriously one of my top 3 burgers of all time. 3.5 stars for her and a solid 5 stars for me. 

The truffle fries, well they sucked. Hard and flavorless unless you soaked them in sauce. 1 star at best. 

All in all I'd say it was a 3.75 stars. I will without a doubt be back for another Bhan Mi Burger next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"PLEASE open a restaurant in Bay Area California!! :P I want me some risotto :P"}
{"text":"It's the best burger I ever had! But the prices does not match the atmosphere... if they updated the dining area this place would be on a whole different level! They have the food down pat!"}
{"text":"This burger straight-up knocked me on my ass. I came here having never heard of Bachi Burger before, and got (with a group) the oxtail chili fries, Kiki's burger, and the trio of ice cream sandwiches. There's no doubt in my mind that it was the best meal I've eaten in 2013. It might be the best three-course meal I've eaten for under $20 in my life. Are you freaking kidding me?

The oxtail chili fries were subtle and smoky, well spiced, had a gorgeous texture. I could have eaten the whole plate. The trio of ice cream sandwiches was a most singular dessert: high quality chocolate, not-terribly-sweet ice cream, and shortbread cookies (paired to the ice creams) witha  decadent nuttiness to them. I was already ludicrously full from the burger, but the ice cream sandwiches kept me coming back, nibble by nibble, to wonder: \"Wait, what's THAT flavor? How do THESE textures work together?\"

That sums up the whole meal, actually: the food was conceived with a level of attentiveness I associate with only the most elite of restaurants. The components of the dishes were all not just high quality, but arranged thoughtfully and playfully with the greatest possible attention to the balance of textures, smells, temperatures, spiciness/sweetness/umaminess/piquancy. The whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Kiki's Burger (angus beef -- caramelized on the outside, perfect juicy medium inside; onion marmalade; dressed greens; three kinds of mushrooms; caramelized bacon; aged gruyere; probably other awesome stuff that I'm forgetting) was the only burger I've ever eaten with motherfucking STAR POWER and that's all I'm going to say about it.

This chain is going to be bigger than Umami Burger. You're not going to be able to get a table at the LA location. In ten years there'll be frozen Bachi Burgers in the aisle of your latest supermarket. This chain is going to blow the heck UP. And I for one am going to eat here as often as I can (strawberry guava cheesecake next time? please!) before everyone finds out about it."}
{"text":"They've combined their ramen place next door. Ramen was okay, not the best broth or meat i had on it. Service was a little too rushed. Couldn't split the bill more than 3 ways when most restaurant could. We asked them to split it to 2 different tables and split it that way but it seemed too much of a hassle for them."}
{"text":"This is THE BURGER place! I have been coming here since they opened. Although I could've left a review back then, I didn't.  I felt like the restaurant needed to establish themselves with better servers (& they have!!). The burgers are so delicious here that my fiance and I have been taking our friends and fam from out of town here.  Everyone agrees that the burgers/fries/dessert are soooo good, they have *bachi* cravings.  Some of our faves are the Ronin & Kiki.  Most of our group like the garlic salt & pepper fries and the sweet potato fries.  They also have refillable iced matcha green tea and a wide selection of boba teas.  The boba teas are good, but I've had better. I like going to actual boba tea establishments for that.  One night around 11pm, my friends and I did not know where to go for dessert and no one wanted to go to the strip or get yogurt.  It's so awesome that bachi is opened late and we got to eat the portuguese donuts, bread pudding and pop tart (OMG they don't have these anymore...)."}
{"text":"Good burger. Not life changing, actually, nothing special at all when you consider the $15 price  on a burger without a side. I got a burger, side of sweet potato fries for $19.50. I eat out often and usually don't care too much about price. But what makes this burger $15? Simply put, overcharged and I was not impressed. 

Tan ten men ramen was weak as well. Super salty and think spaghetti type noodles."}
{"text":"So we bit into the hype and we're sure glad we did! We are now jumping on the Bachi bandwagon. For a location that's only been open for 3 weeks they sure have worked out the kinks and gave a very impressive first time experience to us newbies. Service was stellar and the FOOD? WOW! I know it's just burgers but match that with quality beef and the freshest of ingredients and you get one succulent and gratifying meal. I got the Kiki burger, there was a lot going on with all the components but all the flavors melded together creating an incredible burger paired with truffle fries and the moan inducing (in a good way of course!) salted caramel marshmallow shake. Hubby got the Mr. Ho's burger which was amazing as well (if you love lap cheong this is definitely the burger for you) with salt and pepper fries and a guava milkshake.

Sure they're a little pricier than your average burger joint, but I'd pay LV strip prices any day to get the first class quality of food and service here.
Shout out to the manager Chris who came out to chat with us and was very proud of his work of art (milkshakes) and their house made caramel and marshmallow. And to our server Desiree who was spectacular. You guys definitely made the experience one for the books. Ohhhhh we also got the Portuguese donuts (Malasadas) for dessert to go. So Onoooooo!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard and read so much about the burgers at this joint, so a few of us went over for lunch.  I ordered the BBQ burger,  i was good,, i wouldnt say the best i ever had but it was good, i also ordered the onion rings and garlic parmasean fries... I liked the onion rings better than the fries.. I would eat here again,, but its not the best as others have claimed,,,  Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent. I've tried almost all of the burgers. My go to items are the Ronin, Kiki, duck or pork belly steamed bao sandwiches, salt and pepper fries and oxtail chili cheese fries. If you're ordering the Shogun burger, I'd recommend sharing it, if you can. It's a great burger but it can feel heavy and rich. I can only have half before I get sick of eating it. Service is great. Everyone is friendly, even though they sometimes look like they're overwhelmed. I always look forward to coming back here when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for 5 years and when I finally did, I was disappointed! Did not like the veggie burger! Tasted like hard lentils soaked in berbere. And it was too crunchy!!! Felt like I was chewing rocks, I couldn't even finish it. But the fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible service! First of all, I repeated my order to the server 2 times and it was was still wrong, had to ask multiple times for a drink refill, waited about 30 minutes for our food, waited another 20 min or so for our check, waited 30 minutes for the waiter to come around to pick up our checks then waited another 30 min for them to return our cards. They had no courtesy at all to give us an update why it's taking so long to charge our card.

We had a party of 6, the trainer informed us we could only split the checks 2 ways but we wanted to split it 3 ways and she said that couldn't be done. The trainee was actually able to split it 3 ways. I don't understand why we were told 1 thing but eventually it was able to be done. 

Also, someone in my party wasn't satisfied with the salt and pepper fries and asked if she can get it without the ginger flavor and the trainer said he will fix it. About 15 minutes later someone else in my party asked about the fries and the trainer said \"I can get those fries out of your way if it bothers you\" REALLY? Where's the customer service?

This was my first time here and I do not plan on coming back here. If I could give zero stars then I would."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is terrible. Will not come back! Waitresses are all like their parents just passed away. How can i enjoy with such terrible service?"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy miso burger but subbed the angus patty for a turkey-chicken patty instead! The boyfriend loved his burger also. Great place for date night."}
{"text":"Great burger and the chili fried chicken is awesome"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsayesque review - Looks like someone took a crap on my plate.  It taste like it too.

Putting it gently, three years later, gone are the crowds and for good reason, the food has become shockingly bad.

To start, the once good oxtail chili cheese fries has become a disgusting mess.  Stringy, over braised, oxtail meat stewed in excessive quantities of cheap (taste like dirt) chili powder then slopped atop soggy fries.  An overcooked, rubbery egg with almost no yolk, processed cheese, wilted cilantro, and shriveled, rubbery Jalapeño peppers round out the dish.   No.

To the patties used for the burgers, yes, adding a little sauce in the raw mix adds flavor.  Adding too much makes the meat wet with an odd texture and causes the burger to break apart when eating.  The toppings lack freshness and now passé sauces are so heavily slathered on, the flavors are completely overpowering and off balance.  

Epic fail for the Kalbi burger (patty fell apart, kalbi marinade and ko chu jang mayo dripping everywhere).  The Spicy Miso burger not far behind, it too oozing some sweet miso concoction, mushy meat falling out with almost no toppings except a hardened piece of cheese in the center of a apple vinaigrette soaked bun.  No and no.

Service is off the Strip friendly and fast but with only three other tables at peak lunch hour, it better be.

Maybe just trying too hard to up the ante in Asian fusion flavors.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"We loved this place when we came 3 years ago on vacation and came twice. Food is delicious. This time we got off the plane, into the rental car and headed straight there for lunch. The wait was longer than told, no problem. When we got seated, my chair was wobbly and I couldn't lean back, I switched it out, no problem. The glass of water he brought me was cracked, no problem. We ordered burgers and fries and got the fries first. They were good, shoestring fries. Then we waited and waited for our burger. Meanwhile people who came in after us had ordered, eaten and paid and were leaving and we still waited. Finally got the burgers and one plate had a hair on it. Now we have a problem. We waited some more for the server to come back to take it away and off the bill. At this point, no one wanted to wait for them to remake it. The burgers are delicious, just so disappointed in our experience this time. Will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"I first came here after finding out that it was going to be featured on Triple D. We wanted to check it out before it was unveiled to the world and then everyone would be flocking to it. Since then, I've gone back a bunch of times and every time the food has been delicious (It makes me sad to see that some yelpers had bad experiences 'cause I just can't imagine it).

I've tried a variety of burgers and appetizers now. You really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The flavors are delectable, and it's all so unique. I would have to say my favorite burger is the Kalbi burger--I order it without kimchi though. Fabulous flavors from the meat to the sauce that they put on it. I've also had the Banh Mi Burger, the Ronin, and a couple more I can't recall right now. Again, I can't think of a single thing to complain about any of them. 

Everyone should try the oxtail chili cheese fries, though. I know the name can be intimidating to some who aren't adventurous in their food experiences, but it is so delicious! The meat part reminds me of bbq pulled pork, but it has a kick to it that makes it a little spicy. On top of thinly cut fries and a fried egg, this app is amazing. The fries, whichever way you get them, are good. Thin cut, so there's a bit of crunch to them. The other appetizer I've had was the Bachi Pickles. From my understanding, it changes almost day to day because it just depends on what vegetables the chef felt like pickling the night before. It was very different and interesting. I liked most of them, but I wouldn't say it's the dish for everyone.

Almost every time I've gone, I've ordered the jasmine milk tea with boba to drink. It's so delicious. I wouldn't say the boba is amazing, but it's decent for a restaurant. I just love that milk tea. It's very floral, though, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't like very flowery tasting tea.

Finally, the servers have always been really nice. The wait time has gone up since it's aired on Triple D, of course, but it's never really that bad. It's almost a coin flip. I've gone on a regular Monday night and the place was packed; probably a 30-40 minute wait to be seated if memory serves me correctly. Then I've also gone on a Tuesday night and barely anyone was there, so it just depends on how lucky you are I suppose."}
{"text":"Easily the most interesting burger I have ever had.  The manga burger was infused with scallops and crab.  The set up of the place is quite simple, but the execution was perfect. For beer fans, go with the hitachino white."}
{"text":"This is one the most ethnic and unique burger places I've ever eaten in Las Vegas.
It's american burgers with blast of Asian flare. 

My favorite burger is the Ronin Burger it was deliciously mouth-watering , savory and sweet. 
(Angus Beef, Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw,  Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ and Yuzu Citrus Aioli). with the Truffle Parmesan fries as a side was spectacular too.
 
This joint can get super crowded and you may have to wait for a table. I suggest going around off peak hours. The staff here is really nice and they provide great service.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So after a couple days on the strip paying for overpriced overrated food we decided to stop at Bachi on the way to Arizona. I first saw the place on triple d and have been wanting to go for a while.  Atmosphere and staff very welcoming and friendly. The food was very reasonable and lived up to the hype

Oxtail fries were exceptional and a must get. 
I had the shogun burger with eel and fois it was incredible. 
Finished off the meal with Vietnamese iced coffee and Portuguese donuts. What a meal. A must stop for anyone who visits Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"My food was good
My wife and my daughter could take it or leave it, but not horrible they said
Service not there
waited for a table to be wiped off at the front desk for 10 minutes as multiple employees passed it including the person who said it would only be a moment
Food took incredibly long
Check took a bit to process as the line to get in grew to at least 8 parties deep with no host and open tables everywhere
Could have been understaffed, who knows"}
{"text":"I used to rave about this place to my friends and family, but my last visit here was just ok. I had the Kiki's Burger on my last visit and the taste was ok. The presentation of the burger was something they just slapped together. The bottom bun was hard...maybe the bread was old. It's hard to imagine that this restaurant would have old bread to serve because it is packed with people. Be prepared to wait a while for a table. The hostess will try to convince you to drive to their other location which is about 20-25 minutes away...not 15 min unless you are a race car driver. Lastly, the service was horrible. Our server or the kitchen lost our order and we were left waiting a long time for our food. What is worse is that the server never acknowledged that our order was not put it right away and did nothing to try to rush our food out."}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on the Food Network so I suggested we come here for an inexpensive dinner. The food was in fact really good but the server we had did not know what she was doing at all. She was nice but totally lost. We shared the bahn mi burger and the pork buns and both were really yummy. It's a good standby place I think but not something that would blow your mind."}
{"text":"Horrible service. This was our second time coming here and left very disappointed. Our food took more than 30 mins to come out while everyone who were sat after us got their food. The staff didn't even bother to check up on us. The only time they checked up on us was after we complained about the food taking too long. When it was time for us to pay they also took 10 minutes picking up our check after they saw that it was ready and I made eye contact with on of the staff, instead they decided to bus the tables around us and came to pick up the check after I held it up so that they can see it. Don't waste your time coming here"}
{"text":"The problem with over hyped places? They never live up the hype. Bachi Burger is the exception to the rule.

In the land of the $10 dollar burger, Bachi sits high above the rest. Tried the Ronin and it was just so damn bomb. Patty was meaty, juicy and perfectly cooked. The soy glaze worked well to bring a tangy, salty-sweet flavor to enhance the meaty-ness. The egg just brought everything together.

Oxtail chili fries are just that. \"Oxtail chili\" - a chili made from oxtail. I was somehow expecting big chunks of oxtail in my chili but I guess they grind the meat. My misunderstanding I guess. Still bomb though.

A definite must try and/or return destination while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite burger joints in Las Vegas. Killer Asian fusion burgers! Always great service be fresh food. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I don't have to make that drive down to windmill for a delicious Bachi Burger, meat so tender that it melts right in your mouth.  

This spot here on Sahara and Ft Apache is a bit bigger with a less waiting period. Actually, I don't ever recall having to wait at all at this location.

Tonight I met up and made great new friends from the yelp community. Terri, Chad and Mel. Terri looks like she's pimpin' Asian males around her haha. But on to the good stuff. Tonight's choice of burger was the spicy miso burger but this time with a change to the beef. Instead of the angus beef it usually comes with, I took our server's recommendation to try it with the wagyu beef and wow was she right. This beef is so much more tender and juicy, especially when done medium rare. It literally did melt in my mouth, had me drooling like Homer Simpson. It also came with all the goodies I like from the spicy miso burger (Onions, Shishito Pepper Mayo, Lettuce , Roasted Garlic, Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette). All the burgers I order from here are ones with fried eggs in them. I just love the taste of yolk melting over the beef.
 
It's a must that you also try their oxtail or garlic fries. Simply irresistible taste. Unfortunately I didn't get any tonight because I was still planning on going for a run and didn't want to get too full.  

I can't remember the names but plenty of good beer to try out here as well. This place is a must to those who have not been here yet. Sucks to be a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were tasty and fresh. The service is wonderful. Everything tastes great. I highly suggest this restaurant as a stop if you visit Las vegas."}
{"text":"Super terrible service, saw our waitress maybe 3 times during our whole one hour wait for our food. No distinct prices on the menu so we were hit with a 26$ burger? Terrible place, wouldn't recommend. If I could I'd give you 0 stars. I literally didn't even have this app and I had to download it just so I could tell you how disappointed I was with my visit."}
{"text":"Service is pretty terrible here, from the moment we had to wait until we finished our meal, it was already left a sour taste in my mouth. I was hoping the food would make up for it, but even that was just a-ok.

The only item really worth getting is the ox tail chili cheese fries

Spicy Miso Burger - 1/5, way too much sauce and raw onions, can't taste anything else. Not even spicy or miso flavored, just sweet sauce

Kiki's Burger - 1/5, very basic tasting, nothing special

Miyagi San's Burger - 4/5, definitely the best out of the three I tried. You can really appreciate the meat on this burger.

Probably wouldn't come back and rather spend my money at in-n-out."}
{"text":"I expected more when I paid 40 dollars for 2 burgers and 2 French fries.Way overpriced and not the best burger I have ever tried.i ordered a burger with purple bun and another one was on wheat bread.mine was terribly gross.my bf complained about his as well.i don't want to describe all things in detail but those burgers didn't make our stomachs feel well later.definitely not going to come back there."}
{"text":"The food here is very good but the service was very poor. The only reason for the 2 stars was because I enjoyed the food. The waitress was attentive to our table but the entire time we were there she was in the kitchen yelling and cussing at the back staff about something she was upset about. Another different employee yelled & cussed at a busser for getting in her way. Our waitress also failed to tell me that there was an extra $4 charge for substituting a chicken patty into the Spicy Miso burger, even though both the regular Spicy Miso & Chicken Burgers were the same exact prices. Everyone was either yelling at each other or walking around the restaurant very fast to get around without acknowledging the guests."}
{"text":"Our first stop and Vegas and what a disappointment. We had 12 people total, but decided to get seated separately so we wouldn't have to wait as long. First party got seated in 40 minutes after writing our names down while the other party waited outside anxiously. I was in the 2nd party. I was walking in and out to check on my friends and I saw plenty of tables leaving and clearing up. After like 20 minutes, I asked how long the wait will be and the hostess didn't know.

I see my friends got fries but no burgers yet. After another 10 minutes, we see so many EMPTY tables so we ask if we could get seated. We even pointed at the empty tables and they told us we will get seated when they were ready... 10 minutes later, we still didn't get seated and our friends that were seated earlier didn't even have burgers yet. 

We all left and went to the Subway next door. What a joke"}
{"text":"AWWWSOME!
My husband and I tried Bachi back in August. We were at a basketball tournament and some teams decided to eat here. It was crowded to say the least! We waited a while but soon as we got seated, service was quick and very pleasant. 
Since this was our first time here, the waiter patiently answered all our questions. The burgers are definitely flavorful. I was worried about all the different additions to the burgers but the flavors worked well together.
The parmesan fries delicious! And my favorite part was the dessert \"Homemade pop tarts\" . Usually i'm too full to eat dessert after a meal but this was a must!

Can't wait for the West LA opening! Congrats to Bachi Burger and we will definitely be visiting  you in Vegas each time we go!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the past, food is always pretty good. 
However the service is closer to poor. They take a longtime to greet you and take the order. Slow to get refills on drinks and seem like there running around in a panic. Maybe the service would be better when it's slow."}
{"text":"Have been to the bachi on the east side several times and it's usually pretty good. The new one on the west side is terrible, poor service no manager on the floor and the food is not nearly the same quality as the east side.
Most likely we won't be back."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is pretty damn good. It is hyped up beyond belief, and some of that hype is definitely warranted. I'll get out the few negative things right off the bat. This place doesn't do reservations. There is always a wait because they don't seat you regardless of the vast amount of empty tables in the restaurant. My hunch is that because they take a while to prepare your food, they don't want to seat everyone at once so that it seems like you're waiting forever for your food. So this way you wait forever in the little waiting area up front before waiting a good while for the food once you order. The food is cooked pretty inconsistently. It's a crap shoot whether or not your burger gets under or overcooked. Also, the food is a little on the pricey side, $14 is one of the cheaper options on the menu for what amounts to a cheeseburger with no sides. I really don't mind it, but I can definitely see some people taking issue with that. 

Now onto the good stuff. The burgers are really damn good here. The buns they put these on are ridiculously good too! I would love to eat everything on those sweet, soft, buns if it were possible. You can tell the ingredients are all quality and you do get a good sized burger. You can easily leave here stuffed. They have tons of unique signature burgers, along with many ways to customize them. They even have options for non beef lovers. I have opted for the Miyagi Son each time. It's a Wagyu burger that has fried egg, crispy onion rings, and a chili mayo and caramelized bacon that I usually opt out of. But if you like those, then definitely leave em on. I also tried a friend's sandwich. It was basically like their BBQ ribs thinly sliced on a bun. But the meat was delicious. We tried their Chili Fried Chicken appetizer, it was also really good. It's basically chili boneless wings. Nothing too spicy, but they had a good flavor nonetheless. Also, the truffle parmesan fries are pretty on point. But do you want to know my favorite thing about Bachi Burger, like the thing that fills my dreams most nights and always put a smile on my face when I think about it???  Well I'll tell you anyway... It's that insaaaane Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. That was the most amazing milkshake I have had in my entire milk shake drinking life. Whatever black magic is used to make that thing so incredible, it is well worth the ridiculous amount of calories it most definitely has. Try it and then thank me later. And nothing says thank you quite like a Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. ;P"}
{"text":"Honestly, Bachi Burger is one of the best gourmet burger joints in Las Vegas. If you expect to have a plain burger with your average toppings for just $2, then go to McDonalds. Otherwise, if you want a next-level, out of this world burger and don't mind forking out $13 just for a single burger, then Bachi Burger is your place.

The employees at Bachi Burger make sure that all of the ingredients are of the highest qualities. Like I said, do not come to Bachi Burger expecting a McDonalds burger. Their burgers are HUGE. The patty itself is thicker than the dining tables. The bun is even thicker, yet it also doesn't overpower the party at the same time. Regardless of whatever burger you get (I got the Miyagi-san burger), it's going to be rich, juicy, and full of flavors.

Don't even get me STARTED on the fries. No matter what kind of fries you get, they cook the fries to absolute crispy perfection. Their oxtail chili cheese fries, especially, is the best fries I've ever had. Oxtail meat, chili, aioli sauce, and French fries all on one plate with a fried egg on top? The combination itself sounds really weird at first, but it is so delicious and fitting that you'll wonder how no one has thought of it before. Even their fry sauce is amazing and nothing like you've ever tasted. Bachi Burger may be famous for their burgers, but their fries actually won me over.

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone! I wish I could be a regular customer. However, I will definitely be back another day."}
{"text":"I am new to the Las Vegas area but I have to say this was a great intro to the burgers that can be found in the valley.  A friend wanted to go on a double date here and my husband and thought, \"why not?\"  I am so happy he suggested here! 

Oxtail chili fries ($14.50)- A definite must as an appetizer. It comes with a healthy portion of everything the names says it will as well as a sunny side up egg and slices of jalapenos on top. It is easy to share and a definite crowd pleaser. I am pretty sure that everyone at my table considered splitting another one.

Spicy miso burger ($10)- This was my burger pick for the night. It came with a huge Angus beef patty, roasted garlic, cheese, peppers, onions, and a fried egg.  I was hoping for something spicy but it didn't matter, I really enjoyed this burger without the kick. It was full of flavor and cooked to perfection.  It is a little hard to eat cause of the size and sauces, so be sure to ask for some extra napkins.  

I am sure I will be back in the future to try out their other burger creations. If you find yourself in the area and are craving a meaty treat this is the place."}
{"text":"i really, really, really wanted to like this place and i did -- i just didn't love it. 

first of all, let me come correct about my prejudices. i think good food is 80% good product (what did TED WILLIAMS say about hitting ?? look for a good pitch and try and do something good with it). the rest is 15% good technique (if you've seen the THOMAS KELLER video where he roasts a chicken, you know that that line blurs with genius but for us mere mortals ...) and 5% good recipes. 

BACHI BURGER works pretty darn hard at getting good product. they seem very conscientious about (locally) sourcing premium ingredients -- i mean LAS VEGAS is in the middle of the desert. i believe their recipes are stellar but their execution (at least the night we were there) is mediocre at best. 

other reviewers have complained about the service. ours was fairly attentive -- she did disappear toward the end of dinner and we had a bit of a time getting our check -- surprising because we came early (on a friday night) and by the time we were ready to leave the place was really filling up. but my biggest complaint was that she seemed bewildered by the menu and couldn't answer any of our questions and we had a few. 

the menu was confusing -- for example the THAT's CHEESY burger under the specialty burger heading and just above the notation that all their burgers are 100% angus beef is a cheeseburger sans burger -- who knew ??? 

kid's GRILLED CHEESE was nasty -- no ifs, ands or buts. JULIANA and WYATT took one bite, made faces and pushed their plates aside. bad idea. bad execution. delete from menu offerings sooner than later.

the STEAMED BUNS (we had the short rib) were really interesting but a bit dry. love the idea. wish they offered a trio (duck and pork belly too) so we could have tried all three. horseradish-yuzu aioli was stiff and a surprisingly poor pairing with the beef. 

the FRIES were limp. i'm sorry but fries are supposed to be crisp. the dollop of black truffle \"something\" looked like my spuds had been strafed by sea gulls in a fly by. the flavors were amazing but ... 

the seemingly endless array of little dipping bowls (house made ketchup and various aiolis) got confusing and nothing was soft and creamy -- mayos really shouldn't be hard and crusty -- should they? the flavors were amazing but ... 

who decided grease spattered buns toasted on a grill next to the burger are a good idea ?? they're slippery and hard to hold on to and you have to wipe your fingers every single time you pick them up. mine fell apart about half way thru the sandwich and i had finish up with a fork. the flavors were amazing but .... 

house made sodas and the PORTUGUESE DOUGHNUTS and VIETNAMESE CINNAMON-COFFEE GELATO were fabulous -- no buts. well, would have preferred the gelato in one of those little bowls the aiolis come in so i wouldn't have had to chase it around my plate with a spoon but ...

my understanding is that at least one of the \"BACHI\" brothers was executive chief at ROY's -- your restaurant shouldn't be good. your restaurant should be great. 

you've already done the hard part. now get to work a little harder at doing the rest."}
{"text":"I dropped by for lunch on my way home after a week in Las Vegas.  While on the Las Vegas strip I had plenty of great gourmet food, but was amazed at how great the food that Bachi Burger was serving.  I recommend the Bahn Mi burger with Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries.  Their burgers are pricey but if you follow my advice you also will walk away amazed!"}
{"text":"I always heard about Bachi Burger and how great it was. I was finally able to try it out! Three people each ordering a burger with Ox tail fries and two pints of beer came out to $75 with tax and tip. Price seems steep but the quality of the burger was spot on. I fell in love with how amazing the burger was. So flavorful and savory. The polite staff made the experience better. I will be sure to come back for more on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger! This was our first meal in Vegas!!! Got the word that this burger joint was legit and it was pretty good!! 

When we entered, it took a couple minutes to get greeted and seated.... so first impressions... not so good! 

Now, inside has a cool feel, modern and an Asian twist because they have a burger/Asian fusion and they even serve Ramen which looked really good! 

The service...... NEEDS TO STEP UP BIG TIME. The service was so slow, I got annoyed! Again, it took them several minutes to greet and sit us.....

Esteban took our drink order and I came out in a pretty good time.... then we ordered....slow..... when we got our first order which was the Ox tail fries which were delicious!!! Ox tail stew over a plate of fries... the sauce, meat mixed with the fries was great! However, when we received the fries, we didn't get plates or napkins, or utensils.... COME ON! 

And I ended up getting all those things myself.... then our burger came which was the kikis burger which was good BUT OVERCOOKED..... I asked for medium rare but it was well done.... but we were so hungry after the flight, I just wanted to eat.... and I even informed Esteban and was hoping for a nice gesture (like a small discount, complimentary fries or drinks) but nothing. 

We also ordered truffle fries and it was really good! Nice flavor and the fries were hot! 

So there was good things but the service really needs to step up.... but One employee Steven was consistent and worked hard and he actually took over to take care of us... and he actually was pretty good.... but the team needs improvement."}
{"text":"Found Bachi Burger through yelp, and nowhere near disappointed! This place has probably the most deliciously tasting burgers rivaling InNout. I was suprised when I saw the menu, asian-influenced burgers, who woulda thought?? 

I had the Ronin Burger, and it was nothin short of miraculous. This place deserves to replace every MCdonalds location and take over the world. Highly recommend to any burger or food lover."}
{"text":"I never write reviews... ever! This place was awesome! my absolute favorite burger! Fries are outrageous. Staff is awesome. And those soft as hell buns!!! Pair that with the awesome combinations of ingredients with wagyu beef! My only complaint is that I live in phx and not vegas! Bachi in Phx Please!!! :) Screw the places on the strip this place is where its at!!!"}
{"text":"Came back to give it another shot.

Ordered the same Miyagi Waygu, and this time they did cook it right.  Last time it wasn't done right, so maybe I caught them on an off day or something.

Also tried the crusty crab, and it was pretty good.  A little extra crunchy and crispy than I would have wanted (We mistakenly thought it would be more crab cakey), but a solid choice if you aren't craving beef.

Again, if you come here, you gotta try the Oxtail fries.  It is true oxtail, and super delicious and tender.

This is the best Asian fusion style burger in town.

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"If you have been to the original location, you know exactly what to expect.  

Only differences I noticed were that this location has much more space and was less crowded when I showed up.  Service was quick, food was cooked perfectly, and everything was great!

Banh-Mi Burger ($9.50): Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables and Nuoc Mam Sauce. This was a great burger! Lots of diversity, consistency, and taste...each bite was perfect.  Highly recommended :)

Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.50): Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream and Sun Dried Tomato Aioli. I've had these a long time ago and wasn't too impressed...gave them another go, and felt the same way. Not too much truffle taste here! Go with the Oxtail fries or the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries if you are solo!

I've tried quite a few of the other burgers here as well...Shogun was pretty good!  I thought the unagi/eel was a little distracting from the foie gras, but overall a good value and yummy burger at around $25.

Come check it out if you haven't already!  A few pics of my recent visit :"}
{"text":"Why have I not written a review for BB yet? My 3rd visit in 8 months. Oxtail chili fries. Eat them fresh. They do not hold up well. Just recently tried the manga burger. Crab & scallops on the usual burger, pretty good. Had Ronin burger the 1st time. Staff's attentiveness is up & down but overall good. Have they finally solved the sewage odor problem?"}
{"text":"I called 5 times to try to place a take out order.   Too bad the phones don't seem to work.   Bootlegger was very happy to take my order.   I've actually never been here even though this place is super close to us.   It would have been a great way to try it."}
{"text":"Mmmm....burrrgers! I literally eat burgers like once a year, and I was having a craving, sooo we went to try Bachi because we've heard from friends that it's pretty good, and it was! I got my burger fix for the year! I had the Black & Green burger with sweet potato fries as a side, it was delicious! My husband opted for the create your own and he was equally as pleased.  The only thing that wasn't that great were the prices, my burger was $14, just for the burger, the fries are separate ($4.50), but whatever I didn't wanna just go to McDonalds, and Bachi uses grass-fed beef, so I'm not mad!! :) It wasn't that busy in there on a Sunday and the service was good, they got you on the water refills, your glass will never be empty! I'd go back next burger craving!"}
{"text":"Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me at...BACHI BURGER! - Wiz Khalifa (roll up)

After all these years, I finally made my way to the infamous Bachi Burger. The wait is kinda long as there aren't that many tables inside but since the weather was nice, it wasn't a problem. I'm not sure how I would feel about the wait if I was hungover and standing outside in the summer vegas heat though lol

Since I had peking duck buns at the Wynn buffet the night before, we opted for the pork belly buns instead and they were delicious. The oxtail fries were quite good, not standout-ish but a nice change of pace as far as fries are concerned. The Miyagi wagyu burger was tasty, and maybe a little messy but the strong flavors were there. The egg was nice but I prefer smaller pieces of bacon. I definitely recommend sharing a burger though with someone (especially if you're planning to order other things) because the fries are a huge portion and the burger is also big enough to be shared. 

Definitely worth taking friends that have never been before."}
{"text":"A moments wait upon arrival... literally a moment.  They got us seated, and a server was there quickly to get drink orders.  We tried a couple of their specialty drinks that included Sake.  Pretty good!

For lunch there was a variety ordered among our four.  I had the \"Just Fries\" with sea salt and a homemade pineapple ketchup.  (YUM!), and a bunless (Im GF) burger patty with swiss and avocado.  So good!  Among the rest of my group we had the grilled sausages appetizer plate, the handmade crispy onion rings, truffle parmesan fries, and a couple more burger varieties that I didnt get to try due to the GF issue).  Every single thing placed on our table was fantastic.  One of my companions had eaten here on a previous visit through the area and loved the oxtail fries, as well.  

I think the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was our server.  She was nice, and friendly, and pretty quick... but each time we asked her opinion of something, or to explain the preparation a little she put a menu in front of us and walked away.  Obviously we had already read the menu (online while we were en route, and again at the table once seated)... I was looking for a better explanation, or an opinion on these items.  The food was great enough, that I would come back again, however, and give it another try!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've ever eaten! The pork belly buns were succulent an flavorful. The burger was so juicy and the seasoning is spot on for a ban Mai. The fried are excellent and I am so stuffed that I'm going into a food coma now so I think I need to stop typing! A must when you're visiting in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Bachi is an amazing find in Vegas. I am disappointed that I haven't tried it sooner! I went with a big group of people and they sat us very quickly. The ambiance in the restaurant is great. They have instrumental music on loop and the interior design is very simple, and modern. 

There were many different choices that sounded very appealing to me, but I decided to go with Kiki's Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The Burger had an intense amount of flavor that my mouth definitely wasn't prepared for! The mix of fresh greens, mushrooms, bacon, onions, cheese and the garlic chili aioli was so flavorful that it left me wanting more and more after every bite. The Truffle Parmesan fries was definitely  a work of perfection.

Overall my first experience at Bachi was great. I would definitely come back to eat here again. I still have many, many more burgers that I want to try."}
{"text":"This place is worth going back to, good food and nice atmostphere

the food:
I had Lychee boba, crusty crab, and banh mi burger. lychee boba, wasnt all that special, kind of pricy for boba, but i mean it was a sit down restaurant, and i dont think i ever saw this before so it was worth trying, tasty, but pricy. 
the crusty crab, first of all i remember the smell being super crabby. it was not the delicious kind of smell, but it was a good tasting burger. kind of like a huge crab cake on a burger bun. not too greasy, but the sauces on this thing was memorable. 
the banh mi burger, yes this was some good stuff. this is something i always wanted, hamburger meat on a baguette with the fun little side pickled vegetables. delicious!
this is a good place to experiment your eating

the restaurant:
it was not too fancy, but very clean! i remember the place being in a weird kind of lot, with other random places, but this place is a nice place to eat at, with lots of random asian like decorations. its to look around when your waitng for your food. clean bathrooms and all.

the service:
the service wasn't above and beyond but good, i remember the food coming out at different times, which doesnt sit well with me but it is a relatively small restaurant, so i guess they do their best. the people are very kind, and helpful when picking out random goodies on the menu. 

all in all this is a very nice place to eat at."}
{"text":"Holy shit show. We waited 20 mins to be seated. With open tables everywhere. They kept saying we don't have a hostess. They wouldn't let me order a burger and sub a chicken patty. 

Waiter: we don't have chicken patties
Me: but you have a chicken burger on the menu.
Waiter: yes, but we can't use the patty for burger style you want. 

We've been here a million times and they have always done it. Place is under new management. Asked for the manager contact info and he said they don't have any of those."}
{"text":"I remember all the hype surrounding Bachi Burger prior to its open last year, and when I tried it myself, I understood why. After leaving for school, I had a list of places I had to go to at least once before I left again - one of which was Bachi Burger.

My friends' never having been was the perfect excuse to go. Badgering them at eleven in the morning, my friends were dismayed at the fact that the burgers and fries were separate. Regardless, we ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries as well as the Sweet Potato. The former are always a good standby with the sundried tomato aioli on the side. The latter were delicious on their own, but the Yuzu citrus aioli didn't mesh as well. 

My three friends ordered the Kiki burger after asking for my suggestion while I ordered the Crusty Crab protein style. I've never had an issue with long waits for food like other reviewers have. The food came out quickly, and we began devouring. My friends loved the bun, but one of them complained that the flavor of the burger only hit midway through. My \"burger\" was a crab cake atop lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion, garnished with a Tarragon Remoulade and mango chutney. It was tasty, a bit on the salty side. Yet, it was a disaster to eat. It fell apart after a bite, and attempting to get all of the accoutrements in one bite proved a challenge.

As for service, one of my friends commented that she felt the need to beat them down in the nicest way possible. Our waters were constantly refilled without the need to pull out the \"I'm dying of thirst\" look at the staff. Our plates were cleared out before we could react. It was definitely the epitome of attentive. 

Overall, good food and service makes for a happy Diana. The only thing stopping me from driving the one minute in between my house and Bachi Burger is my conscious. Thank God for that."}
{"text":"The Kiki burger is hands down the best burger I've ever had! Delicious mushrooms, juicy burger, gruyere cheese, garlic aoli, all on a soft hawaiin sweet bun. Add that with a side of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and appetizer of Pork Belly Buns and you have a meal so rich in flavor that the trek off the strip is 100% worth it.

I've been to Bachi twice (first time was at the other location) and have been thoroughly satisfied with both my experiences. I don't remember the service at the other location but this location had superb service. Very attentive with ordering, clearing dishes and refilling water. What more can you ask for?

Definately for me a must go every time I'm in Vegas. Honestly, I'm not sure how far off the strip both the locations are because we had a rental car and have local friends, but if you have a chance, go HERE!"}
{"text":"Third time here, but this time was not good at all. Thumbs down, the meat was very dry and burnt. Very disappointed. Waiter was nice but really I was not happy with my food . I bought my family and friends they were very disappointed and not happy with there burnt burger . I will not come there any more . The man who got us a drink older man with glass was rude. And he was not happy. To get us napkin or spoon etc. I wast my money down the drain that it not worth the food that my friend except it. If I could rate this place I will rate no star at all . Really no star that how bad the food was . How are u going to sever burnt food to your customers and expect them to eat dry meat and burnt and on top rude man."}
{"text":"I went here on a quick lunch break with a co-worker. The service was good and there were no mistakes on our order. Yeah the prices are a little high, but that's what is becoming of Vegas. Greed. 
Anyway, so I got a burger and so did my co-worker, but she also added fries to her order and we shared. The sauces were good, and the burger was cooked like we wanted. Only reason why I might not come back to this restaurant, is because (and this might be TMI) you have to go to the bathroom right after lol. So, I do not know what's in the food, but make sure you have a close restroom."}
{"text":"I rarely give places a five start... but it is well deserved at this place.  The burgers are unique and fresh, fresh, fresh!  I went here twice in the few days I was in Las Vegas.  I have read on some reviews that the service is slow... it's a busy place!  You can tell they take their time in prepping their food so that makes it slower, which is fine with me since I wasn't there for a \"fast food\" type burger.

In the two trips I had there I had a couple of burgers that were beef/pork combinations and they were fantastic!

Don't leave the place without trying the pork belly steams buns as an appetizer or you have missed a real treat.

This is a place I would be a regular at working my way down every item on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here on 1/3/15 at 7:15 pm. The burgers were good, but the service was awful as usual. The hostess is always frazzled, and tries her best to discourage customers by telling them \"it will be over an hour wait, and then it will take over an hour to get your food. We have another location in Summerlin, you should go there instead.\" She went through this song and dance with me and several other customers who had to interrupt her narrative and ask her to simply place our names on the waitlist. She was irritated by this and it showed.

We go to Bachi for the unique burger combinations, but the customer service needs an overhaul...perhaps a new hostess with customer service skills would help. I don't know if we'll return. Too many other burger places to try out that actually WANT customers in their restaurant. If you go here, try the oxtail fries, Burgers (shogun, miso, calbee), bachi fish."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant from a friend that lives in Vegas and I've now been here a couple of times. The food is great and they have friendly service. One thing they are famous for is their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and it is delicious! The meat is well cooked and it serves as a great appetizer. The next thing to get is their burgers. I've tried their Ronin Burger and the Miyagi-San Burger and they are also cooked to your liking and tastes very good. I recommend to come here when you're leaving your Vegas vacation and you just have to try it!"}
{"text":"Honestly all the hype about this restaurant is overrated. 

Oxtail chili cheese fries overly sweet & barely any oxtail. 

Takoyaki was yummy big chunks of octopus.

Sausages was a tad salty.

Kiki burger, again too sweet & you couldn't taste the bacon very thin but meat was cooked perfectly. 

Miyagi San was ok nothing special, sane scenario about the bacon. 

Service was fast & great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but something they did in the beginning irked me so much that I spoke about it even after we left.. The wait time was said to be 25 minutes for a party of 3. It ended up  being about an hour wait, but that wasn't the worst part. There was a party of 2 sitting at a table made for 3 or more... when there was a table for 2 that was open right next to them. So guess where they sat our party? Yes, they sat my party of 3 in the table made for 2 when they could have easily moved the party of 2, who just got their waters, to our table. It bugged me so much that I had to take a star away from them...  

BUT the food made up for that silliness. 

\"Kiki Burger\" Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion  Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli (Got the info from their website) BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Everything about this burger was so right. The way the beef was cooked (order it medium, it's the best that way) down to how the buns were toasted. The mixture of the bacon, sweet onion and mushrooms were just heaven in my mouth. Seriously, the best I've had. [$10-11] 

I ordered the \"Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries\" thinking that it would be enough for one person. I was so very wrong. It took 3 of us to take it down (still had left overs). Definitely a great combo too. It had an egg on top & the fries were crispy! Loved it as well! [$11] Service was on point & the place was very clean... Great experience here. Definitely will be back when I get back to Vegas. It's \"a must have\" for me now."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places to go to! And a new location is going to open up in Summerlin (Fort Apache & Sahara)!

My favorite thing to get here is the bunh-mi burger. Tastes just like the vietnamese sandwich but in burger form! How'd they do it?! Anyway, last night I finally tried something new, the shogun burger..so flavorful and messy! But so good I could not help but feel the $25 I paid for the burger was kind of expensive for the 2 mins it took to inhale the burger in. Anyway, per usual i never order a burger without the truffle fries!  Last night, the server accidentally threw away my fries when I asked to have them in a take out box. Without any complaints they made me a new batch to take home! Service has changed a lot in the last few months, they are definitely very very attentive to their customers now... I swear there was a server asking how the burger was or how we were doing every 5 mins."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place sinec it was so close to home. But it really fell short. 

Initial impression of the place was that it looked nice and very clean. 

We were excited and tried the Wagyu burger and a Ronin burger. Took a while for the server to take the order but we figured it must be busy and it's ok if the food is worth it. 

Sat aroung for 15 mins, looked around and some people waited for about 15 mins and still didnt get water and have orders taken. Others looked like they have been waiting for a while to get thier orders...

How long does it take to cook a hamburger, its not an elaborate meal or anything. 

So food finally came and we were not impressed. 
-Salt and Pepper fries: man they smelled soo good but soft, soggy fries are hard to over look expecially when they look store bought. 
-Wagyu burger: the plate looked very poor in presentation, a $10 burger with the add ons should look a little nicer, a burger in the middle of a plate with nothing else looks dinky, maybe leave it open faced with side sauces or fries to fill space for presentation. 
Ronin Burger: It was ok, nothing to write home to mom about, the meat tatsed the same as the Wagyu one though. 

Asked for our check and took forever that to come as well. Seems like the servers take the order and just hang out at the food window instead of walk around and give refills or give any kind of service at all. 

Overall, this dont not impress at all. Same price as the Burger Bar (minus the foie gras, truffles of course) but not even close to the service at all. Not worth a second try, we both agreed an In-N-Out meal would of been better and less than half price."}
{"text":"Kalbi burger is my favorite, kimchi and burger goes so well together! I'd give this place a 5 star but the price had gone up too much, dislike."}
{"text":"Their Burgers are original and authentic...The Banh Mi Burger, Grass Fed Waygu Burger, Oxtail Chili Fries, Truffle Parmesan Fries...It's all really good. Its not your typical Burger joint...including nice table cloths, romantic lighting, and full wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is as trendy and hipster as a burger place can get. For wait times, I usually come in on weekend nights and I'm almost immediately seated.

The waiters are top notch, they have good knowledge of their food, what's the best selling, refills on water, and the normal checking up.

I usually order the ronin burger. It has angus beef, caramelized onions, japanese cole slaw, mis goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli aka just a bomb selection of ingredients. I've tried most of their menu but I feel like this is probably one of the best ones. Taking a bite out it the  yolk immediately oozes out and creates a secondary spreading on the burger making it even more juicy ^^. . This burger was definitely a 5/5.

And with any of their orders I always get their truffle parmesan fries, it is always consistent and I never had a bad batch of fries from them. Fries are also a 5/5. Not too greasy, and has the right amount of parmesan.

If I could change anything about the food is I wish they could give more sauce! It last only half the meal, and the charge for more :/ .
 
If you're anywhere in Vegas, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yes, the flavors were amazing and the portions generous.

Ambiance is top notch and the service was prompt.

But I just can't justify paying this much for burgers.

I was in Vegas and I didn't have much time for lunch so after reading the yelp reviews, I felt like I had to try it.

If you are a huge burger fan or foodie, you owe it to yourself to try it out, but I'm ever in Vegas again, I will just go to a buffet."}
{"text":"Whole lot of wow! The burgers and fries were amazing, truly a unique burger experience. I had the spicy miso burger, my wife had the kiki burger, and we shared the sweet potato fries. Everything was perfectly prepared, and very tasty! 

I wasn't a fan of the loud dance music, but the food was delicious, and a great value. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger place ever and the pho is amazing too. Pho is not as traditional as expected (not a fan of corn in my soup) but still delicious. The black and blue burger is my favorite by far."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointing. My husband and I have been here numerous times and the service has always been on point. I just left after being in there for 10-15 minutes. I brought my daughter in with me and as we were being seated I asked for a high chair for her. Ignored. There were 3 or 4 servers at a time standing at the bar. Never once greeted or even had a drink order. Definitely not busy & the servers that were going from table to table were walking like they had lead in their shoes. No one smiled. I didn't even get a \"Hello\" or smile from the hostess. Super disappointed and pissed that I drove across town for nothing."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very tasty burger with well seasoned fries. That simple. Just a damn tasty burger."}
{"text":"Wow, where can you go for a burger with a pork, shrimp, and sirloin patty, wild mushrooms, and parmesean truffle fries?  Only in vegas, and only here!

I was surprised to find such innovative and gourmet cuisine in such a humble place, its a real hidden gem!  In fact, before I love Burgers opened, it was my favorite burger place in town, bar none."}
{"text":"Recently went here and was amazed at how wonderful this place is. I was seated immediately and brought water as drink order was taken. I ordered an appetizer of the Chili Garlic edamame. This was Salty, with just enough heat to give you a thirst for a nice cold beer. They have several great beers on tap. Fortunately the y had a beer on tap that I recently had at Hakassan. Hitachino Nest Beer White Ale. I then Had the Rhonin Burger.
 Angus Beef  Caramelized Onions  Japanese 
Cole Slaw  Miso Goma Dressing  Fried Egg 
Katsu BBQ  Yuzu Citrus Aioli. 
I added aged Cheddar for an added bite. Cooked a perfect medium rare as I like it. You need to cut in half to start the egg just oozes down the burger making your taste buds yearn for that perfect bite. It was a perfect bite. I will with out a doubt eat  here again.
The service was excellent and attentive, and you know how I feel about that. Prices are moderate.
I will say this joint is jumping at lunch time and the staff handled it well. Good place for group lunches. If you get a chance go check this out if you have not. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Bachi burger but this location totally blew it for me..the service was horrible and we were 1 of 2 tables but the lady was pissy from the get go..maybe she was just having a bad day but I would rather drive to the other locations for their yummy burgers because service is just as important as the food!.."}
{"text":"The pork bally buns is so good that I can never have enough and the sauce tastes so good I think is more than barbecue sauce or seafood sauce but it is really good! The burger it is okay i order the Robin burger, But it's not as good as I thought maybe I didn't order the right one ;( Anyway I am going to try the baby back red and the lobsters Sandwiches next time! Over all this is a really good place But wish they got more dessert option...."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Bachi Burger and every time I come I'm more and more elated to be there and always leave satisfied. It's the best burger in LA and one of the best in Las Vegas. Make sure to get the Oxtail fries!! THEY ARE A MUST! Literally, everything on the menu is good. I've tried every single burger they have between myself and my friends and they are all good but by far my favorite has to be the Miyagi San burger. It's amazing and you have to give it a try! 

Go eat at Bachi!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down. Food is mediocre and waiting time for food is about 2 hours. I would avoid this place. We come to Vegas every year and we had a wonderful meal here Last year but this year is different.  My kids fell sleep waiting for food. Stay away...."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious, the burgers have an asian/japanese taste to them. Very freshly made and truffle fries are also a must! Casual but can be semi dressy. 

Ordered a kiki burger and the spicy miso burger and for the meat we chose medium, it was pretty much the best burger ever, very juicy and tender."}
{"text":"OMG- everything I just ate was amazing... we had Truffle fries, oxtail Chile fries, pork belly steam buns, chicken salad sandwich and a the Miami burger, holy heck it was soooooo good, and our server was great, fast and cool... is name is Adrian... amazing"}
{"text":"Been here many times now, on a fairly occasional basis because this place gives me the cravings. Their burgers are very unique and are very tasty. Personal favorite is the ronin - fried egg, carmelized onion, japanese coleslaw. Really great balance of flavors. The also do a really solid chicken wing - very crispy and great flavor. They also do some pretty good shakes. The only miss was the crab artichoke dip - definitely had a bit of a fishy smell to it and was fairly bland. Overall though, burgers and truffle parmesan fries are bomb. Service is ok, not bad.
4.25/5"}
{"text":"This is one of the better burger places I've been to. Each visit has been decent service. The haven't screwed up my order yet. The fires are delicious along with the burgers. If you like burgers and want something actually cooked. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time during a slow hours around 4pm. All I could say is I commend the staff and the cooks. The food and the quality of service surpassed all my expectations. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING FOOD!  GREAT SERVICE!  Asian fusion burgers - yum!

Went here Wednesday night.  No line!  Waited a few minutes to be seated.

Our waitress, Erica, was extremely pleasant throughout our whole dining experience, frequently checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.

FOOd ordered:
- Oxtail chili cheese fries: declicious, plentiful helping of chili and cheese along with jalepenos
- Ronin burger: coleslaw and egg in the burger, the bottom bun got a little soggy toward the end (i actually preferred my friend's Kiki burger)
- Kiki burger: sweet kick to the taste, bacon makes everything taste good
- onion rings: thinly sliced onion rings in batter, kind of like an onion tempura

BOTH BURGERS WERE OOZING WITH TASTY JUICES
** there are no substitutions for any of their menu items **

I most def RECOMMEND this place and I will definitely be coming back here again to try something different!

The food and service were superb - drinks were always filled and food came out pretty quickly.  Prices are decent as well.

This place is right next to the movie theater so maybe that's why it's busy sometimes.  Just go on a weekday then you won't have a wait!"}
{"text":"So good, I stayed at Jennie's Air BnB down the street (Brass Ring Road) and walked over.  The Servers were all very young but very attentive and professional yet relaxed.  
I went straight for the med rare Shogun Burger, a wagyu beef patty underneath a healthy slab of foie gras and fresh greens.  Got the truffle fries on the side and a not stale black tea (might have been freshly brewed, I'm not fancy enough to know the difference.)   
Service wait was about 7 minutes with a half-packed dining room and wait staff was very attentive.  
My Shogun Burger was pure magic, everybit worth the high price tag, and the fries were crispy yet soft, also perfectly cooked.   This is the kind of establishment I wish was in my hometown.  Enjoy Vegas."}
{"text":"Wasn't as good the second time around but I don't know if that was influenced by the horrible service.  Usually don't complain about service cuz I'm just there because the food tastes good however they were horrible top to bottom this time. Our waiter, the server, the bartender, the host, the cook... Ok probably not that far but all the others mentioned did seem to irk us in some manner that night, albeit slow service or simple lack of attentiveness. Felt bad that I blew this place up to all my friends. And btw the burger was just ok this time."}
{"text":"Delicious! The banh mi burger was mouth watering and tasted like... well, banh mi. The salt and pepper garlic fries were tasty as well. This place is going to be one of my have to go places every time I visit Vegas. Friendly service. Didn't get a chance to try the ramen. Next time"}
{"text":"Yes, I have already returned! I rarely write an update this soon, but the Crusty Crab and Bachi Fish asked me kindly to share their tastiness with you. Not literally of course, but these are two of the tastiest seafood numbers on a bun that I have come across. So, if you prefer fish over meat, don't fret! You will be just as pleased as your burger buddies if you head here. The crab cake is full of crab, perhaps a bit mushy, but delicious, and the fish sandwich is busting with flavorful pesce. I also discovered bottomless iced mochi and barley tea! The only thing missing is a ginger drink. If this appears, I may have to buy stock."}
{"text":"I love the original, and apparently, it can be replicated! Bottomless iced green matcha, check! The Lonely Bird, check! I have heard that this location has a slightly varied menu from the original, but I just can't keep my hands off the Bird. It was as delectable and beautiful as I remember, and the service was super attentive. Honestly, when the burgers hit the table, you almost don't have to eat them because they are a feast for the eyes, but a feast for the belly is so much more fun! Burger party in my belly! #YSB"}
{"text":"Excelentes hamburguesa las mejores de Vegas muy rico y súper original y muy rico  prueba las frais con trufa !"}
{"text":"To put bluntly, if you're a burger lover, you will absolutely appreciate all the work that goes into the making of this over-the-top, eccentric, amazing menu.

I went to the Windmill location with my husband and mother-in-law, and we had been looking forward to this since seeing Bachi on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  I already knew everything we were going to order: the steamed buns, oxtail fries, and lots and lots of burgers.  I swear I wanted to order every burger on the menu (and I thought I could honestly eat every single one because I'm currently pregnant).

The wait: We were told there would be a 40-45 minute wait (lunch rush, totally understandable), and we had nothing else to do, so we sat. We waited maybe 30 minutes before being seated.

The service: We had great service.  The waitstaff were attentive even though it was crazy nutjob busy.

The food: We ordered the following -- (1) pork belly steamed buns: AMAZEballs!  I'm not a big pork belly fan, but the sauce on the side and the crisp radish in the buns make it a great appetizer.  It comes in a plate of 3, so we each had one. A fabulous amuse-bouche.  (2) oxtail chili cheese fries: very yummy!  Thin, McDonalds-like fries doused in chili beans, garlic aioli, oxtail and cheese. A huge serving -- you can easily share with 4-5 people. (3) Miyagi San burger, (4) Kiki's Burger, (5) Shogun burger. 

Note: The Shogun burger is no joke.  A $26 burger touting amazing high quality ingredients like wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, and a bunch of stuff I can't remember. It was incredible.  Foodies will delight, just as we did, I'm sure!

Drinks:  Make sure to ask which drinks have free refills and which don't.  The lemonade, for example, is fresh pressed and you order each separately.

All in all, 3 burgers, the steamed buns, oxtail fries, a large Asahi beer and 3 lemonades cost us $100.  Which, for Vegas, isn't bad in my opinion.

I can't wait for their Santa Monica location to open up in January.  This could be dangerous."}
{"text":"Great place! The food was incredible and Bianca, our server and Miranda, the host were so nice and accommodating. They went out of their way to make sure we were happy eaters!! And the over 21 shake was so tasty! Next time we are in Vegas, we'll go back again!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet: overrated and disappointing. The server/barkeep, Dillon, was fantastic. I'm not going to review each burger my wife and I had....I don't think it's important, really. We had a small piece of foie gras, a la carte, to be eaten with our burger; it was grotesquely ill-prepared. The burger...each...was pedestrian, at best. The oxtail fries were pretty good...but only \"ok\"....by no means special. And with that, I'll stop. Skip it....the food is as memorable at Fatburger and the prices here.....BIZARRELY outrageous. Never again."}
{"text":"The burgers are very good, but be prepared to pay almost 18$ per burger and another 10$ to add cheese/bacon/and avocado. Yes 10$ addtl for all 3. & fries are also charged seperate...I pay it because its good, & u can taste the quality of the meat. however my least fav thing from here is the SUPER SUPER LONG WAIT. Be prepared to wait 15 mins for your server to greet you and another 40 for your food. (Not kidding) Theres literally one other table here besides our party of 4, and I have enough time to type all this, because its been a good 30 min wait for our food. Staff is very polite, just slow?"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!
Pork belly steam buns are not to be missed!!! 
Green & Black burger was great!!! 
3-way Caramel Apple Tart is awesome!!!
I'll be back in January for CES and bringing friends!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend from Vegas said, \"If you only eat at one place in Vegas, it's got to be Bachi Burger!\"

Kalbi burger - nice moist meat. The flavor was reminiscent of Korean BBQ especially with the kimchi. Nice touch. 

Oxtail fries - yum! What a great idea.  I especially love the over easy egg on top. 

Truffle fries - if you don't order this, you're not missing much. It was just ok.

Garlic fries - a lot better than the truffle fries, but alas, not that great.

Red velvet milkshake - if you like red velvet cake, this is a must try.  

Vietnamese iced coffee - umm...this was just regular iced coffee. This was not strong coffee from a French press with condensed milk. Nope. Nope. Nope!

Service - ever time I've gone, the service has been friendly and they've Bon on top of soda/water refills."}
{"text":"Let's just say I'm from San Francisco and I make a trip to Vegas 2-3 times a year and it's now going to be a tradition to go to Bachi as part of our itinerary. THAT, or I'm not leaving until I get my Bachi fix!

It's SO WORTH the trip away from the busy strip of Vegas. I've always loved Asian fusion burgers mainly because of the execution of pairing Western ideas and concepts with Asian sauces and marinate. I love the Ronin and Banh Mi burger; both had distinctive flavors but was not overwhelming! The burgers had key ingredients that were so proportionate and was just perfect with the moist patties and soft baked buns. I also tried their oxtail fries; yay for the topped fried egg. What isnt better with a fried egg?!

I wish Bachi expanded to Norcal. It would be a HUGE hit! Until then, I'll have to order two burgers each visit in order to try all their burgers. I said it Bachi -- you guys are worth the calories. I'd get fat for ya. 

Bachi Faithful! :P"}
{"text":"Found out not too long ago that they're opening up another restaurant in Village Square!! My only concern is that the food stays the same but nonetheless I am STOKED!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is, by far, the best burger joint that I've ever been to. The Kiki burger is the best burger I've ever had, hands down. Just amazing. My friends tried their other burgers, such as The Miyagi burger, or The Ronin burger, and they were equally delighted by the deliciousness of it all.

We also ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries, those were really good as well.

No complaints on service, it was excellent, everyone was polite and helpful. Our waiter was a really cool dude.

If you're in Vegas, you've got to go check this place out, it's a must. There is a little wait time, due to the popularity of the restaurant, but it is well worth the wait. BEST BURGER EVER."}
{"text":"I have probably been to bachi burger about 30 to 40 times since they opened in Vegas a few years ago, with at least 25 visits being at this windmill location. Expanding throughout Vegas and now California, it seems that taste has gone down it bit. Perhaps the mastermind of the menu is the one who prepares and cooks the burgers best?

Brought my boyfriend here, and he was disappointed in the oxtail chili cheese fries and in his burger. He loves meat, so he was not pleased when the chili overpowered the fries and he could barely find any oxtail. He asked the server if the oxtail was real and was told yes, but I wish we were given some insight in the oxtail to chili to cheese ratio since we made it foolproof obvious that neither of us tried oxtail chili fries before. I try not to blame the server for he is not the cook and is probably used to the dishes being just...dishes. But, if the server was deliberately holding his tongue to watch us just order things to reach some sort of sales quota, then I would be deeply disappointed. 

My boyfriend said the meat in his medium rare KiKi Burger was kind of tasteless, and said the same for my medium rare Miyagi-san. He loves meat so much that he expected more from such a popular gourmet asian fusion burger joint. I still appreciated the Miyagi-san, but I do agree that it has changed and slightly gone down in taste over the years.

For this location, the tonkotsu shio ramen by Shoku Ramen-ya (same management next door) had a delicious broth and tamago. We enjoyed it!

The 3 workers we interacted with were well-mannered, and we appreciate that."}
{"text":"Still 5/5. Went a few days ago on my last trip and was initially going to try their soft shell crab po' boy but they were all out! Not so sadly, I settled for another Shogun burger. While it is a $25 burger, I was up from gambling so I didn't paying the price. This time I added egg even though I was afraid it would conflict with the foie gras and unagi but it didn't.  Maybe next time I'll bacon too!

I will be back for the soft shell po' boy next time for sure."}
{"text":"Amazingly on a Friday night, not much of a wait (no longer than 20 minutes) due to the Foodie Festival happening over at the Linq. Great to be off the strip. Eat like the locals do! I chose the Ronin burger, which was Angus beef, caramelized onions, coleslaw, Miso Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ Yuzu Citrus Aioli. She got the Kalbi burger and we shared an order of the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (garlic aioli and fried egg). Next time I will definitely try another burger or the duck buns. I actually finished the whole burger, it was so good. Such a treat."}
{"text":"If you want to eat off the strip, try to stop by this place. This place is pretty good, but not somewhere I have to go when I go to Vegas. This places does get pack during the weekend, but the wait usually isn't that long. I only got the Oxtail chili cheese fries since I was not hungry at the time. I tasted some of my friends orders and it was pretty good. I can't say much about this place since I didn't get to really try the food as much as I wanted to, but I will update my review it once I head back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I got here pretty late, about 15-30 minutes before closing time with my boyfriend and sisters. We ordered oxtail chili cheese fries, one of my sisters ordered a kalbi burger, the other ordered a Miyagi-San burger, I got the banh mi burger, and my boyfriend got the spicy miso burger. We finished the fries, which were oh-so-delicious! They were a little sweet, savory, and the egg on top made it a million times better. Excellent. The burgers were awesome, but we didn't have room in our tummies to finish them. We did, however, finish them later that night. Even though we came before closing, they did not rush us. I heard they are opening a Bachi Burger in LA! Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent. The burgers are amazing, fries go well with the meal. Left here super full. 

Service here is hit & miss. We once waited over 20 minutes to get acknowledged I. The doorway and another 20 to have 3 groups in front of us seated when servers, bartenders etc are having drinks behind the bar. Another time we waited almost 45 minutes for a seat by was acknowledged and kept informed. I guess it just depends on the day. 

Overall, if you are willing to wait for service or lack thereof the food makes it more than worth it. They could step it up though.

Recommend: based on food alone yes. Good luck with anything else."}
{"text":"Went here last year, everything was really yummy. My Toronto BBF recommended it and it was no mistake!

The truffle fries were sooo good. The drinks menu was extensive.

Excellent music!

What was interesting when looking at their menu and their decor, was that the owner is from Hawaii! Cool! Extra points for that! :)

Recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of burgers at all but Bachi changes the entire game for me. This is a great environment for family dinners and gathering with a group of friends. Sometimes they could get pretty busy so wait time to get seated could range from 15-20 minutes. Once you get seated they take your drink orders and you look over the menu to see what you want.

I usually order the Kimchee burger with Oxtail fries. It is so good together. Everything on the menu in my opinion is savory and I think that's a huge plus in my book. They also have a bar if you want to order any other drinks. The wait time for your food is roughly 15 minutes, average. Because of the fries I usually don't finish my burger but the portions are big for one person to get full off of. Overall, great experience here!"}
{"text":"A lot of time things on Triple D are a miss (Diners, drive ins, and dives) and sometimes I wonder how these places obtain such recognition. 
But I have to say that Bachi burger is the real deal. Normally food like burgers and fries are very heavy and make you get the Itus aka food coma. Buf after eating here I felt light and refreshed. The food is a nice play on Asian fusion burgers and fries so if you're familiar with Asian food you'll get the subtle nature of how the flavors come together. (hats off to the chef because there are some very cleaver combinations).

The staff was friendly and we were seated right away. I know this place is off the strip, but at 4pm it was packed. So if you want to try this place go around the 2pmish time. My friend and I came here at 3:30 pm and there was a 20 minute wait so we opted to go to the bar.  No less than 30 minutes later there was a line at the entrance and people waiting outside.
The burgers here are an excellent value and the Foie gras burger was on par pricing wise compared to the one I had on the strip ($28 range) the other burgers are ala cart and were around $8-12 depending on what you want in it. 

I had the spicy miso burger and that was definitely a knife and fork burger (or lots of napkin burger). The burger was cooked to perfection. I really like the Taiwanese bun it was something different than what the normal burger joint has. 

So all you Vegas ppl  if you rent a car I suggest that you go out here and try it.  If you don't like it and are in vegas when I am I'll buy you lunch somewhere else*



* Note: participant must be in vegas the same time as me and must not like bachi burger. (sorry I don't go to vegas that much lol...)"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the bachi burger across town. This one maintains my expectations. Clean place. Amazing food. Great service. Love the black and green burger and the kiki's burger. Yummy! The flavors just meld together perfectly!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Black and green burger and garlic fries... Great service. Refreshing drinks. Nice atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place on the recommendations of several food blogs. It was certainly worth the stop!
Started off with the grilled shishito peppers which weren't too hot but quite flavorful. I ended up trying the Miyagi-san Wagyu Burger, which simply put was impeccable. The beef was buttery, the addons were fantastic and every bite was a myriad of taste. I imagine every burger has this taste so I'm looking forward to subsequent visits. Also tried the truffle parmesan fries which were the perfect accompaniment. Service was a bit slower than what i expect from a casual place but it wasn't an inconvenience.

Finally, this location is off the regular path which was great as there was no line on a Saturday night. Overall, a great experience. Thanks Bachi!"}
{"text":"Great portion size, I took part of it home. The garlic fries were to die for! Just wish the seating were a little more comfortable and encouraged you to hang out.
I will go back because I think their prices are set perfectly for the food they offer, my server was attentive and like I said before, I couldn't finish my burger. I got the spicy miso burger, wasn't to spicy but good flavor. I cant wait to try some of the other burgers."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Vegas! Not even a contest. Nothing else even remotely compares. 

Oxtail fries-a must! So delicious!

Kiki burger with a fried egg on it...pretty much a lifestyle change. You go from commoner to elite after consuming this. 

Truffle fries-another must. 

Seriously, just writing this review makes me want to go there today. So good!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Bachi burger. The service was great. Very friendly staff. We had the oxtail chili fries which were so good.  I had the waygu burger with fried onion rings and my husband had the banh-mi burger. Both were excellent.  I would definitely come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Kiki's Burger with Wagyu Grass Fed Beef
Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Yeah Buddy!

{"text":"Being a professional chef for nearly 20 years I like to read reviews on hot new concepts and I have to say that reading past entries regarding the service at this place was sub par almost deterred me from giving it a shot.  It was a Monday evening and we wanted something affordable but memorable.  Upon entry I was greeted right away and seated promptly (it was very busy but they were happy to separate tables.)  Approached by a great waiter..\"Lance\" and quickly given the rundown on the concept and the menu highlights...he was honest with suggestions and was excited about the food.  Great non-pressure waiter and service, all around awesome...Food was delicious...very stylized preparations, portion sizes and super packed with wonderful, delicate and intense flavors, every ingredient holds its own.....I thought it was great and I'm a foodie....
Had the Kalbi Burger, Bahn Hi, Burger, Sweet Potato Fries with Yuzu  Citrus Aioli, Truffle Fries with SDT Ailoi, Fried Chicken Chili App...and a couple of Tall Kirins and Vietnamese Coffee...less than $50...I was okay with that...I recommend highly"}
{"text":"I went to Bachi Burger originally about 5 years ago, at their Windmill location.  I loved it then, but never really found myself on that side of town when I was craving a burger.  

A while back, I had bookmarked Bachi HLK, but never had the chance to try it.  
Fast forward to a month ago, and I noticed driving home one day, that the location of the Bachi HLK was now a Bachi Burger.   YES!

The other day, I was craving a burger, and so my fiance and I decided to head over for dinner.

The location is a little small, but very open, and very clean.  

We experienced super polite service from several employees, from the person who sat us, to our server to the busser.  Everyone was super polite and friendly, which made for a pleasant experience. 

My fella and I split an order of the homemade pickles, which are to die for.  We had: pickled cucumber (pickles), beets, japanese eggplant, onions, and garlic.  (all pickled) 
Oh. My.  Word.  
So delicious, I think these have improved over the last 5 years.  The onions and garlic are my favorite!  These are a must, every time.

We also had the duck breast bao buns.  These had
Muscovy Duck Breast, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, and Hoisin BBQ Sauce.  
These were incredible.  All of the flavors worked so well together, and the Hoisin bbq sauce was a perfect compliment.  I'd had bao buns once before, and thought that they were good while others said that they were awful (at another restaurant), but THESE were amazing.  They were light, airy, delicate...SO good.  I can't wait to try the pork ones!

Now, the burger.  
We chose the Banh-Mi:  Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce. 
Wow.  We had it cooked medium, since there is pork, we wanted to make sure it was cooked through...we're definitely more medium rare people, but this was cooked very well.  
The burger was delicious.  Juicy, and packed with flavor.  They brought out a small dish of fish sauce (Nuoc Mam Sauce) to use as a dipping sauce for the burger.  I am not usually a fan of fish sauce...I think it smells like feet. 
THIS one though, had no unpleasant aroma, and actually enhanced the flavor of the burger!  

A friend that was with us also had the Brussels sprouts, which were really tasty as well.  

For drinks, we had the plantation style sweet tea, which had mint and was sweetened with pineapple juice!  It was really good.  

I had the Adult milkshake, the Kona Nightcap:  that has...a whole bunch of deliciousness that I can't remember...I know it had Godiva chocolate liqueur, Kahlua, Baileys....and ice cream. That made me very happy.

They're a little pricey, but they have some insane Weekday happy hour deals.  Monday through Friday from 3-6:30 they have $6 appetizers...and that includes the oxtail chili cheese fries (which are good, even second hand and cold like I tried them the other day.).  

I plan to be back to his location often, especially since they are right near my house. 
Excellent job to the wait staff and kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Consistently great! We love this place for ourselves, but always a great place to bring out of town guests. The oxtail chili fries are in a category all their own. The burgers are great quality and the mixture of flavors will keep you eating long after you are full. The also love the ramen. At this point I struggle to know whether or have spicy miso ramen or the Kiki burger. Both are amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to both locations now, and can say without a doubt these are some of the best burgers I've ever had. The flavors are very rich and creative, and the buns are light and fluffy so as not to distract from the meat/cheese/other goodness. This will always be a stop any time I'm in Vegas; it's just that good. Plus, this location isn't nearly as crowded as the one south of the strip."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back. I sat at the bar, and was offered a drink by the host. Who didn't even bring it. Why offer then? Server was nice enough, took my order brought me my drink and chopsticks. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which was so salty. Not once did the server notice that I didn't have a napkin because she was too preoccupied with her two friends that sat at the end of the bar. So she offers my bill to me. I immediately give her my credit card. And she goes and exchanges a few words with her friends then does her rounds and then brings me my credit card back. So I decide to go use the restroom. Paper towels everywhere, whatever no big deal. I try to lock the door behind me and the lock is broken in the men's room. I mean, does anything work around here. It isn't her fault for the salty ramen or the broken restroom lock. Still tipped her $3 on my $10 bill. I also work in the food service industry so it can be hard I get it, but all around fail. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Friends & I went on a Friday around 7:30- be prepared for at least a 30 min wait. The fries are amazing the burgers ok- a little on the sweet side for me. With that said I would be willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"A must try! Especially if you're like me and rarely splurge calorie wise on the whole shebang ... Burger, fries and shake! I always have a hard time choosing by my favs are the Ronin and Banh Mi, but they're is something simple n pure about the Lonely Bird. I am however a Salt n Pepper fries loyalist. And always start with the house made Bachi Pickles (ask for extra garlic!)."}
{"text":"Second those that have said this place has 5 star potential with some service kinks. It is new, however, and I have faith that this place can get it together !

Location: like others have said, it's hard to find. Pull into the parking lot across from Vons and aim for the NW corner tucked away. 

The menu is freaking awesome. Creative. reasonably priced. AND cool drinks! Bada** beers (Honey Wheat, Sam Adams Cherry, as well as the Japanese staples). Priced around $5 a beer that seems about right. 

We dined for lunch so I tried a Mango milk tea. It was alright. It took like 15 minutes to show up, but again that gets back to those new restaurant service kinks. 

Grilled cheese - I read Keith's review but stupidly ordered it anyways. It's overpriced ($7) and wasn't special. There's all these yummy gourmet ingredients but honestly the sandwich had the taste/texture/consistency of a white cheddar grilled cheese sandwich. I think they need to work on this dish a bit. 

Bachi wagyu burger (5 oz for $9). I enjoyed the subtle bbq sauce they added to the burger. The bun was delicious and soft. They had tons of unique burger options but we stuck with the classic. It was a nice take on the classic cheeseburger. The 5 oz size is absolutely perfect. You feel full but not disgusting after eating it! They didn't ask us how we liked it cooked - mb next time we'll specify medium. Either way the burger has so much more flavor and moisture and goodness than Create or Cheeburger in my opinion!

Classic fries - really great fries and the pineapple ketchup is uber yummy! Yup we were boring on this choice as well.

I love forwad to returning this place over and over again. The menu has so many cool options! Props to them for opening a truly unique burger concept in a town of too many burger joints!"}
{"text":"The oxtail fries are a must! The burgers were full of flavor and the buns were delicious too. My boyfriend and I tried the Bahn-mi Burger and the Kalbi Burger. The only reason why I'm leaving out that last star is because our waitress forgot my drink order and it took an extremely long time to get our bill. Other than that, this place is definitely a place to try. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Better than burger bar... Where else can I get my island taste than with a Burger... 

First off: Oxtail Fries are a must
Secondly: MIYAGI is my favorite... so much so that I'm scared to try other things because I won't have that favorite burger taste... 

MUST BRING YOUR FRIENDS"}
{"text":"Love it! Not as crowded as the Windmill place and not as far as Summerlin for me.  SO, it gets 5 stars just for that... Same awesome service and food. My go to BACHI until everyone finds out about it..."}
{"text":"Second day in Vegas, my friends wanted me to try this place out as they've been craving this place since their last visit to the Sin City a few months ago and I'm glad they introduce this place to me as now as I'm craving it. 

I got \"The Lonely Bird\" burger and my boyfriend got the \"Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu\" burger and both were is freaking delicious, good thing we split our  1/2 and  1/2 so we got to try each other's' burgers. Hands down these two burgers were the best I've ever eaten! \"The  Lonely Bird'' had a hint of sweetness and the pesto sauce was to die for, totally worked well together. The \"Miyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu\" burger was just so juicy and again they flavors just all worked well together.

We all shared an order of their famous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and although it was good, I would have liked it better if there were more oxtail in the dish. I think I would do without the oxtail fries next time and just get their other stuff but  I cannot wait to come back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place with a friend of mine, and I thought the food was pretty good.  I ordered Kiki's burger, and it was just delicious.  My friend ordered the fish sandwich, and I will probably get that next time.  The fish was seasoned so well, and the taste was great.  We also shared an order of sweet potato fries . ..  the sauce tasted like it was horseradish based, which I normally don't like, but it was a nice compliment to the sweetness of the sweet potato fries.

Definitely will be coming back here again.  Just expect to pay gourmet burger prices."}
{"text":"I'm not big on hamburgers only because I think of fast food when I eat them and how unhealthy it is...BUT this place is freaking amazing. They use 100% Angus beef, super fresh, the sweet potato fries with the ketchup-hawaiian dressing is awesome. I highly recommend this place! It's not cheap but for the quality of food that they serve there, definitely worth every penny :)!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on DDD and always try and hit a DDD spot when we are close to one when traveling, Service was great, burgers were awesome. We will recommend this spot to friends. Tip go when there is no rush 1 to 4 in the afternoon was a good time and the waitress told us the same thing."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness my goodness my goodness goodness gracious. I don't even know where to begin with how epically delicious our meal was at Bachi Burger... The Ronin is just the very best burger I can ever remember eating. Potentially there was a more insanely amazing burger somewhere in my infancy and I can't recall it. But that really seems unlikely, especially because we were eating dinner with my parents and I think they would have reminded me. But I digest..;)
Our hostess, our waiter and the manager helping to check on tables were all absolutely friendly and gracious. The hostess even set up a high chair at our table for my son before escorting us over to it, ix-naying the unnecessary chair and making sure the sharp knives were well out of reach. When we first got to Bachi Burger it was a young professionals at happy hour type of crowd and I was worried were wrecking the vibe (as my baby was nomming puffs of cereal and gumming teething toys like a villain). But later in the evening two other families with young children came in and I got the impression that Bachi Burger does a good job catering to a wide variety of crowds. It was already pretty busy at 7pm on a Monday so I would definitely recommend making a reservation.
On a future visit (who wants to come back with me tomorrow? And the next day?:)) I would order the salt and pepper fries to accompany the Ronin. The salt and pepper fries had just enough going on with their seasoning, the crunchy slivers of jalapeño and hot chili dipping sauce to complement but not compete with the burger main event. The Parmesan truffle fries I got were just a little too heavy to go with such an already complex burger, but they were definitely deserving of another visit in their own right. I also really enjoyed the Kiki burger and the iced matcha green tea (oddly much better-tasting with the meal than on it's own). 
Oh my goodness, Bachi Burger. I can't wait to see you again!!"}
{"text":"So good!  Haven't had anything I haven't liked. I always try to make a trip there whenever I'm Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A Japanese influenced burger joint? Great freaking idea and it really works! All the burger combos on the menu sounded great and we ended up ordering the veggie and Kiki's burger to spit and try something new. The veggie burger was really yummy but super crumbly and coulda used more sauce as the patty was a bit dry. Kiki's burger was excellent and it arrived and pre-smoosh was about 8 inches tall. With a side of the garlic fries, it was heaven. With a beer and garlic fries, it was nirvana. The service was also excellent and everyone was insanely nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"About a 20 minute drive off the strip, but it is totally worth it! 

Waited no more than 15 minutes and quickly got seated near the bar. The service was great and my glass of water was always full! 

Shared a miyagi san burger, oxtail chili cheese fries, and truffle fries with friends and my tummy was one happy camper.

I definitely recommend a fried egg in your burger (if it doesn't already come with one). BEST THING EVER."}
{"text":"Newer Bachi Burger location! Less crowded, more spacious, and similar distance as the original!

Per usual, must order the oxtail chili fries. While I've had the Miyagi San burger on several occasions, I decided to go for the Ronin burger. Less sauce-y, but definitely just as delicious! 

I would recommend heading to this location! I came around 430-5 pm and there was only a few tables occupied. 

Great srvice and great food! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place that was recommended by my brother when we went to Vegas. We were seated pretty quickly since it wasn't too busy and our waiter was really nice in taking our orders.

In terms of the interior design, I really like the clean modern look this place has, with the dark wood wall furnishings and seating along a spattered wall gray background and the dining area for customers is on a black chair + brown table combos. I'm seeing this growing trend of this look at I definitely like it

Now for the food itself I got the miyagi-san burger and my brother got the spicy miso burger. We both tried a bit of the others burger and we also ordered truffle parmesan fries with a tomato aioli sauce. The fries were great, fantastic with the sweet sauce they served it with. The miyagi-san burger was extra juicy, made with wagyu beef and bacon, a fried egg, and caramelized onions. Full of flavor and definitely a moutful to eat. I especially preferred my brother's burger, the spicy mayo, as it had a classic American burger look, but with the added kalbi beef, fried egg and spicy mayo flavor, gave it a new asian and zany touch to it. It was definitely sweeter than he burger I got, I'll probably get that one next time for sure."}
{"text":"Top 5 burger places I've ever been to. The menu makes me want to come back asap to try another one of their perfectly cooked, interesting burger concoctions."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 - we loved it. I ordered the meatless burger and I think it may have been the best one that I ever had. It was made from red beans and it was nutty which was great for taste and consistency. The bun was wonderful. Similar to the bread use for baked BBQ pork buns at dim sum/Chinese places. My brother got the Bachi fish sandwich which I believe was cod. He really like it, the fish was fresh and a generous size. We shared sweet potato fries and my brother also got the mocha shake which he said was delicious. 

Service: 3/5 - It wasn't bad just slow. There was one waitress (it was memorial day late lunch time) with a support guy, who I think was new, and served as drink/food runner. There was a manager-like guy and another woman-maybe owner (?) but, they were not really helping out when clearly the waitress was busy (maybe 7+ tables). I asked for lemons for my water and had to wait and ask several times. Finally, about 20 mins in, our waitress brought lime slices saying they didn't have lemon which I really found odd. I'm not sure I have been to a sit down restaurant where they didn't have lemons.

Space: 4/5 - nice, new, darker lighting. I've never liked the parking at this set of stores/strip mall. It is near the movie theatre so, parking spaces can be a far and once you are in a row, you can't just turn and go down another row. You have to drive a ways down."}
{"text":"Good food but grossly overpriced. $12 dollars for three duck buns? Madness."}
{"text":"Came in with my friends and I. The restaurant is full but we didn't wait that long because they did have a ramen side. I had asked Erica the hostess  for a recommendation which burger she liked the most and she has referrers miyagi. I'm glad I listened to her because it was delicious. The meat was cooked the way I had asked and from the way it looked, my friends also enjoyed their food. We had cleaned our plate because everything was just delicious. Our service was great: actually everything about this restaurant is great except the qena bathroom was out of order. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good! Obviously, you have to wait because they are pretty much always busy, but it's totally worth it. Small place, great atmosphere, and delicious food. Truffle Parmesan fries are a must have!"}
{"text":"Like every other young person from Southern California, I frequent Las Vegas.  Sometimes I get tired of the buffets, expensive restaurants, or 24 hour diners you go to satisfy some drunk cravings. If you're willing to drive a little off the strip,  you gotta try this place out.  Everything is so good and everyone is so nice!

We had:
Truffle Parmesan Fries
Peking Duck Steamed Buns (3 in an order)
Kiki Burger
Portuguese donuts with Vietnamese cinnamon ice cream

We started with a few craft beers which were all really good. Fries were perfect. The duck buns tasted pretty authentic!  Kiki burger was amazing. The donuts were a perfect end. 

I always say I'm not a burger person but i LOVED everything here. I think Bachi Burger converted me."}
{"text":"Really AWSOME burger. I highly recommend this little jewel. The staff is very friendly and they have some pretty good beer too."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, we found Bachi Burger/Kitchen on the Food Network, so we decided to give them a whirl.  Since then, we've been back a few times per year since we live on the other side of town.  Each time, we've never been disappointed including our family and friends who we've taken over time.  Today, the wife and I decided to have brunch there for Mamacita Day since we were coming from Town Sq.  Good thing we did.  

First off, they had a special buffet menu for Mother's Day which they allowed customers to sample over 10 items, and as many times as we wanted... all for $20.  They were trying to do something different for special occasions, and to drive more traffic during non-peak time according to their Corp Chef, Kellen, who happened to be there today and came out to chat with us about our dining experience.  That was pretty cool... and let us tell you, their potential new menu items were all AWESOME with a capital \"A\"!    And so was our server Alex!

On with the food for all you foodies!  
Instead of our regular Oxtail chili cheese fries and Banmi Burgers being avail, they had bottomless mimosas for all moms, and $5 bottomless for everyone else.  All dishes were petite size which allowed you to taste several dishes before getting full.  But if you found something you liked, you could order more.  The short rib hash w/sunny side egg was probably the best dish of the day.  Talk about Asian/American fusion food... Hope this item makes it on their potential new breakfast menu.  We had something very similar in Philly recently, but this was by far much tastier.  We also had their Wagyu sliders, Pan roasted chicken, Smoked Salmon Benedict, maple glazed bacon and sausage, and Pork belly sliders to name a few.   If you're a fan of pork belly, you've got to come to this joint.  I really like the sliders over at Fat Chows, but Bachi has hands down the best in town!  They apparently cook the pork 3 different times before serving them with the right amount of Hoisen sauce.   It's oven cooked, deep fried, then pan sautéed before serving.   Yum and borderline take us to \"Ohio\"!   

Two big thumbs up Bachi Burger/Kitchen for having outstanding and extremely tasty foods, but also for having courage to expand your already successful menu!"}
{"text":"We came here after a day exploring Red Rock Canyon in a group of 9.
Trying to figure out where to eat, someone suggested trying this place after he saw it on DDD. I looked it up and remembered I already had bookmarked it after seeing so many great reviews, we had to go!
Upon arriving we did run into a little snag, there seemed to be a bit of a wait and a lot of people in the group were getting grumpy.. We almost left, but my ever hungry friend really wanted to eat here, unusual for a guy who didn't want to wait to meet his idols Penn & Teller! Maybe his foodie senses were tingling. I knew mine were, the burgers coming out to people's tables looked amazing.

We stood around for a while, then we were moved to the back porch so we can sit while we waited. There were quite a few empty tables for a place that had a long wait, I can only assume they only seat people they can feed so people don't get pissed that the food is taking too long to come out. Makes sense I suppose.
We finally got seated after waiting almost 45 minutes.
From there things improved, food came out relatively quickly.
We started with the Ox Tail Chili Fries. Impressively good, it disappeared quickly.
When it came time to choose my burger I had a hard time deciding, they all looked so good! It was a tie between The KiKi and Mr Ho. A few others wanted to try Mr. Ho, so I chose the KiKi and a Mr. Ho to split with the group.
As we waited we snacked on the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries, which had some fresh ginger thrown in which I wasn't expecting, a nice surprise as I love ginger.
Our burgers came out fairly quickly. My KiKi was pretty good, the Shogun my ever hungry friend had was really good, but the Mr. Ho pretty much stole the show with it's combination of beef and Lup Cheong sausage on top not to mention it's purple Taro bun! It's a good example of how you don't need to spend $25 on a burger, at $10 Mr Ho is a bargain.

Certainly one of the highlight meals of my Vegas trip, my only complaint other than the initial wait, would be that we don't have Bachi Burger back home."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants! Everything is always on point every visit! I usually just get the build your own burger and add avocado and cheddar to it and it's so yummy! My boyfriend and I always go here for date nights and it's perfect. We recently tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and they were so good considering I don't like chili cheese fries at all. I also really like the Jasmine milk tea but some days it's on and off. I love the red velvet(not sure if they still have it) and peanut butter chocolate shake! Will always come back(:"}
{"text":"Friendly server but it wasn't busy and we ordered the oxtail chili fries (delicious), calamari and 2 burgers.  The server rang in my burger wrong so by the time I got mine, my girlfriend was done with hers and the calamari was never ordered.  4 bucks off the bill as a gesture and when I finally got my meal it was great. Mistakes happen but we probably won't go back:/"}
{"text":"Back for the second time and I was as pleased as the first. I ordered the crusted crab burger again. OMG. It is delicious. Seared crab cake with mango salsa aioli, avacado, tarter sauce , arugula, and onion strings on a soft bun.  Perfection!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas! Asian fusion style burgers, meat is high quality and everything is pleasing aesthetic-wise and stomach-wise.

I didn't know this until the last time I went a few days ago, but they have a lunch special for $19- appetizer, burger, fries, dessert, and drink (soda or tea)! Amazing deal for such high quality eats, especially considering some of their burgers by themselves are $15. My husband and I got the smoked salmon soup, brussels sprouts, Ronin and Kiki burgers, truffle fries and the doughnuts and panna cotta desserts, and everything tasted amazing. What made it even better was that for all of that, we paid $50 including tip! Very reasonable considering how much food we got.

Whenever I'm in the Summerlin area, Bachi Burger is definitely a must."}
{"text":"I've been to many burger places and eaten a variety of burgers... and I must say their Kalbi Burger is hands down the BEST burger I have ever had in my life!!!!!! My sister lives in Vegas so every time I come to visit, I make her take me to Bachi for that Kalbi Burger. The flavor and quality of the meat is just outstanding. The pickles that come with it is a perfect addition to the burger. And, Bachi also makes their own soda and it is so yummy and refreshing! 

Their oxtail chili cheese fries are also to die for. I really wish Bachi would come to San Jose-- we need an Asiani fusion burger place down here!

This should definitely be on your list if you are going to Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Placed a togo order on the phone at 4:34p... Got there at 4:51p and was told 5-10 mins... Still waiting at 5:20p and being told it's going to be another 5-10 mins... Finally leaving at 5:28p... That's over an hour for a togo order... Just seems a bit ridiculous for an established restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger I have ever tasted. We were in Vegas for my daughter's wedding and stopped here after reading the reviews prior to heading to the airport.  I had the Kiki and my husband had the Ronin. The high quality beef combined with the unusual Asian flair was just superb. The Parmesan truffle fries were very good as well. The customer service was great; however, we were there before the dinner crowd. Apparently they are opening a new restaurant in Summerlin; with any luck they will expand to Southern California!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Vegas. I liked it even more than Gordon ramsays BURGR. I'd say burgr has the better sides and bachi has the better burger.  Get the one with.mushrooms. delicious."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Bachi Burger, there was a 2+ hour wait around 7PM. We needed to head back to OC sooner than that on a Sunday evening, so unfortunately we didn't get to try it out until Cinco de Mayo/Fight Night weekend 2014. We went straight there upon arrival in Vegas around 10PM-11PM. My boyfriend was certain he spotted professional boxer Mickey Bey enjoying a post-fight burger...

A couple of us ordered Hitachino beers imported from Japan. At $9 each, I could have done without it since the burger was actually pretty filling. But when in Rome/Vegas, right? The Real Ginger Brew was light and refreshing, but not the most outstanding ginger beer I've ever had. I'm just glad that it was 8% ABV.

My boyfriend ordered Sweet Potato Fries $4.50 done Truffle Parmesean style for an extra $1. It was seasoned with sea salt and came with yuzu citrus aioli. He definitely couldn't finish them, so if you are very hungry it is a good value for an appetizer.

He also ordered the Banh-Mi Burger $11, a Vietnamese-style burger. It definitely tasted the way a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich would taste in delicious, beefy, burger form.

I ordered the Kiki's Burger $11 with a fried egg for an additional $1.50. I was very satisfied with this burger because it was a spicy and sweet tastebud party, but I could have done without the egg. Our server was talking it up, I feel like maybe he was just upselling me on the beer and the egg (tips for higher tax/tips haha). There was plenty of bacon, but of course I saved it for my last bite. I would definitely order this burger again, sans fried egg.

The buns at Bachi Burger are extremely fluffy, but once you start eating it will flatten out. Overall, the food is delicious and made with good quality ingredients. I am looking forward to the next time I come to Vegas for another yummy, fluffy-bunned fusion burger!"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister during my bachelorette party weekend.  I'd heard about it on the foodnetwork so I was excited to try it.  The concept is pretty cool . . . Asian-ized burgers.  What's not to like?

We ordered the onion rings, the kiki, and the truffle fries.  The onion rings were delicious! They're tempura style so they're nice and crunchy.  You also don't get the problem where you take a bite and the entire onion falls out of the crust.  The truffle fries were good, but I wasn't the hugest fan of the gravy on them.  I guess I'm a \"purest\" when it comes to truffle fries.  The only things on them should be garlic, truffle oil, parmesan, and maybe some parsley.  On to the kiki.  How can you go wrong with onion jam, mushrooms, and bacon??? It was very good, but not the best burger I've had.  The Taiwanese sweet bread bun was really tasty, but the burger was lacking the meat flavor I'm accustomed to getting in a good burger.  

However, I hear that they're opening a location in my hood (West LA) so I'll be sure to take my fiance there to check it out."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you're ready for orgasms in your mouth, followed by a food coma that hits you so hard, you're struggling to make it through the the rest of your day. 

Oxtail fries: OMG 
Ronin burger: OMG 

Only reason I give it a 4, is because my buddy ordered a chicken farmers? burger and they didn't have chicken. Waiter broke the bad news and dude ordered the Krabby Patty. Waiter came back and 'sorry we don't have it, man'. Dude then ordered a fish burger and it was all good. So because they were out of items on the menu, we were a little disappointed, though s**t happens, I guess. Overall, it was straight delicious."}
{"text":"One word... AMAZING!!! I came here from Sacramento with a group of friends who live in San Diego. We shared a few appetizers and each ordered our own entrees. 

Appetizers:
Calamari 
Oxtail chili fries 
Truffle fries 

Entrees: 
Bahn mi burger (medium) 
Loco moco with risotto, waygu beef, fried onions with siracha and bacon jam

Everything was ridiculously good! The Bahn mi burger was so juicy and it came with a side of pickled daikon (radish) and carrots and a fish sauce for dipping....Drools! 

The loco moco was a twist of Hawaiian and French! It was just incredible. 

Our waiter Mindi was very nice and attentive. The decor inside was nice and clean. 

They need something like this in the Bay Area!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger joint I've been to. Affordable and amazing service, our waiter was super friendly. His names Dan :) I got the miyagi sun burger medium well and oxtail fries. Oh my gosh. It was absolutely on point. Very satisfying meal and definitely want to come back here. Be prepared to wait in line though! But it's DEFINITELY worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"My friends were raving about this place so I decided to join in and try out this place even though I'm not big on meaty/beefy burgers. I ordered the ronin burger and their Parmesan  truffle fries. The meat was cooked just as requested \"medium\" and the sauce were tasty and delightful. The buns were soft and sweet and it kind of reminded me of Hawaiian sweet bread/rolls. I liked the caramelized onions but they were too sweet. I am a big fan of truffle French fries but they could do better. Overall I like the place but I find it a bit over price for location and ambiance. I give this joint 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Good food. Enjoyable environment. Highly recommend. Service good. Clean
The burgers are simply incredible"}
{"text":"Service is so bad here. It took 20 minutes for our server to bring back my change. The food is always good it's just the workers. Oh and the hostess (blonde hostess) was just rude right off the back. She really seemed like she 1. Hates her job or 2. Just was having a bad day. Either way its not good to show that type of attitude especially when you're the first face the customer sees when they walk into a restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the Ronin. He had the Black and Green. The house salad was exceptional with the orange vinegar dressing. Yum!  The citrus dipping sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was really good. The pineapple ketchup with the regular fries was to DIE for!  Both burgers were very well done. We will go back. A little pricey for burgers, but I wasn't mad.  Ambiance felt a little rushed and the waiters didn't inform us of much for being first timers. Seats aren't the most comfortable. If you are craving a burger, this is the place to go. Of you want just an ordinary burger, don't. Coffee mint shake with vodka was good. About $76 with tip."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas so many times and I don't know why I've never heard of this place. I came here with my large family early afternoon for lunch. They set up a table for 9 very quickly.

Here is what we ordered:

- The oxtail fries with fried egg on top was amazing. We should have ordered two for our big group but we didn't want to overstuff ourself before the burgers. We had 4 kids with us and they loved this as well!
- Miyagi-san's grass fed burger amazing!
- The Ronin amazing!
- Kiki's Burger was very flavorful.
- My cousin and I split the Shogun burger, we wanted to get our foie gras fix as we can't get it in CA anymore. Especially at $26 a burger, we figured we should share. It was delicious!

Honestly, even the burgers the kids ordered on their kid's menu was juicy and yummy. 

All I gotta say is wish we had one in CA. I could go for some of their oxtail fries right about now. :)"}
{"text":"The burgers were quite tasty and the variety of burgers and fries was very nice. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came back to Bachi Burger after dining here 3 years ago. The food is still very delicious and great quality, however the service was below average. The restaurant was empty, only about 3 tables with customers. The food took a very long to time to come out, the cooks were getting into arguments in front of the customers, which was embarrassing and took away from our dining experience. Hopefully the customer service improves."}
{"text":"I'm drooling as I am writing this review....

I went here last weekend and I must say, probably the best burger I've tried:

The following items I tried:

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:

Warning, this item requires more than 2 people to finish if you are also eating a burger. Me and my buddy made a mistake in chowing this down first. A few points, its absolutely delicious, the chili tasted great, theres a friend egg on top and some cilantro, and some sort of mayonaisse based sauce. The fries were crispy, just wonderful, but yeah just make sure there's 3-4 of you to share, or you'll fall asleep after eating this. 

Pork Belly Buns:
These bun taco type psuedo-sandwiches are popular nowadays. (I've tried the one at momofuku in NYC, so that was the benchmark). Tasted very good, not at the momofuku level, but very well prepared. The pork belly was well flavored, tender and the dryness of the sliced egg really balanced the sweetness and fat of the pork belly.  The portion is a little small but these really should be appetizers.

Ronin Burger

Probably the best burger you will try, the meat can be either angus or wagyu (similar to Kobe Beef) if you have the wallet. Honestly you can't go wrong either way because the meat quality is excellent. I asked for Medium Rare and it came back closer to the rare end, which is perfect. It is literally steak tartarte in the center. Well flavored, can't say enough great things. The bun was like Hawaiian sweet rolls (Taiwanese bread).

Only downside is, with all the money they are making they should invest in a better ventilation system, cause all the smoke from the kitchen made it difficult to see the other end of the restaurant, but all in all a must visit. I'm coming back next time im in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oxtail fries......In short........YUM!
Oh my the burgers are awesome!
Cannot wait until the next trip over Thanksgiving.....who cares about Turkey when Bachi Burger is all you need!"}
{"text":"Items selected:

Foie Gras, Apple/Celery/Cranberry Salad, Duck-Cherry Fritter
Chili Fried Chicken, Ginger, Garlic, Shoyu
Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Garlic Aioli, Fried Egg
Salted Caramel Marshmallow Shake
Peking Style Duck Bao - Cilantro, Scallion, Radish, Boiled Egg, Black Vinaigrette, Hoisin BBQ
Kiki's Burger - Angus, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki, Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Aged Gruyere
Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato

Generally eschewing ground meats it was for myself something beyond Angus, Kobe and Wagyu that brought me to the Summerlin location of local darling Bachi Burger on Sunday, though I will say from the start that the \"Kiki's Burger\" ordered by my mother was potentially the best dish in an afternoon where only a single dish failed to impress despite the best efforts of our server to misinterpret the phrase \"please course things out and do not bring everything at once.\"  A surprisingly large space featuring slick woods and polished surfaces throughout it was just after 3:00pm when we arrived for late lunch/early dinner and selecting widely from the menu inclusive of a $15 foie gras appetizer it was with the hunger derived from nearly 8 hours of unpacking that we waited, only to have every single plate arrive simultaneously thirty minutes later resulting in both an overloaded table and tough choices about what would taste best at room temperature or below.  Focusing on the food it should be noted that much of what was ordered actually came to the table exceptionally well prepared and beginning with the foie gras I was immediately impressed by the quality and presentation, a single vein the only flaw in an otherwise Robuchon-quality prep featuring a caramelized medallion alongside a semi-sweet salad plus creamy, rich croquette and moving next to crispy, complex chicken alongside the equally crisp but decidedly spicy fries it was with good fortune that the milk shake, albeit small, was present to quell the heat.  Overlooking the spongy, dense bao and tepid duck entirely lacking for crisp skin and instead assisting my mother with the lightly charred burger topped with woodsy mushrooms and aromatic marmalade it was perhaps with recollections of the zeppole at Settebello the day prior that I ordered the doughnuts and although not quite as impressive, the eggy brioche stood strong beneath a dense lacquer of sugar rounding out a fairly impressive afternoon largely warranting the $75 tab, if not a significant tip."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here after seeing it on Guy's 3D. I hate duck so we had the pork belly buns. OMG. There was every flavor imaginable in your mouth. And the bun was just so good on it's own. It was stellar. I also loved their homemade pickles because where I come from, we eat Japanese pickles with everything Asian. The pickles (and everything else) was plated very aesthetically and just lovely to look at. I got the Miyagi-san and it was okay. Maybe I was satiated so my brain wasn't as receptive to it. Or maybe it was that the steamed buns were so good that these paled in comparison. Or I just chose the wrong burger combo. Whatever it was, I didn't feel the beef had nearly as much flavor as the pork belly packed. I wished the beef was marinated more or something. I did love the bread though which was squishy and soft.
 
My bf got the Honeydew boba and that was disgusting. They did not put nearly enough powder to make it taste sweet. Whoever made that should be retrained! I also did not like the ice cream cookie dessert. And aside from the hour-long wait due to construction, it was okay. We will definitely be back and hope the service has improved then."}
{"text":"I love this place and I usually go this place like once or twice a month after school since it is also on my way to my house. But today I guess I have experience the worst service that I have been in my life.. They have like 4 servers and a bartender serving only 4 tables and still have to wait like 10 mins to get you order, If I did not ask the server who is passing by probably I'll be there forever or decided to leave..Plus over cooked my burger from medium to well done.. Sucks huh? And how could it happen that the burger comes out first before the apps? What's the purpose of the menu and the staffs who does not know what are they doing? I'm not sure if its the chef or a cook who did come out and stare at me like I'm the one who did fucked up after I talked to my server regarding on the temp of my burger... I love this place but not coming back after what happened... It is just a burger and thats a burger place, that there is no other way to overtemp the burger that far"}
{"text":"Yummy , prettytasty and have there own unique flavor. Wish the place was a little bigger because this place is very pack at night wait for 30min. Services was alright"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Really nice restaurant, seems to be fairly new. 
The waiter and staff are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about there menu. Very helpful for first timers. My wife and I enjoyed the French fries,Brussel sprouts, pork belly/bao, and Miyagi Burger. 
A must try while in Vegas if your in the mood for a unique burger. We will be back again"}
{"text":"Thumbs Up!  A great selection of burgers - Ronin, Ho, Kiki, Kalbi, Banh-Mi, Miyagi-San and more.  Don't forget the delicious oxtail chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"I never heard of this place until a friend recommended it.  It was so yummy and actually the burgers are very reasonable.  I really like the banh mi burger because of the sauce that comes with it.  The oxtail fries were the bomb!!  I need to fly back to Vegas just to try the rest of the menu!  Service was excellent.  The servers were so friendly!"}
{"text":"ZOOOOOOOOOOOMG FOOD IS SO BOMB! best burger ive ever had.......... sometimes the service and kitchen lag quite some time, but totally worth it! no lie. i want one, now!"}
{"text":"Informed it was going to be a 15 minute wait, but ended up waiting for 30 minutes.  Waiter was awesome in letting us know about all the burgers.  There was four of us eating and he said the ox tail chili cheese fries would be more that enough for all of us.  He should have said it was good for two.  Another suggestion would be to bring it out when we got our burgers.  There was nothing to eat with our burgers since we finished the chili cheese fries.  

Order the Banh Mi Burger!!!  The roll/bun is so soft and fresh.  I can't wait for my next vacation in Vegas so I can go back!!!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say that Bachi Burger did a superb job of bringing Asian flavors into the typical American burger.  The buns and meat that Bachi Burger uses both have a distinct flavor to them that you could taste in every single one of the four burgers that I got a chance to taste.  It was very interesting to experience how the different toppings from the different burgers enhanced the inherent flavor of the meat and buns.  The four burgers we got were the kalbi, miyagi-san, kiki, and spicy miso.  Of the four, I thought that the kalbi and miyagi-san tasted the best, but that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy the kiki and spicy miso as well.  

The oxtail chili cheese fries were absolutely amazing as well.  These fries tasted less greasy than normal fries, and had a little bit of a sweetness to them that you don't normally get from normal chili cheese fries.  

I'm not a truffle fries connoisseur, but the truffle fries here tasted pretty much the same as they did at other places that I've had truffle fries. 

Bottom line: Bachi Burger is the end game to what all asian fusion restaurants aspire to."}
{"text":"Tried this place after seeing great reviews and I have to say this is the best burger place hands down that I have tried so far. Totally beats Umami burger, The Counter, Slater's 50/50, and The Habbit among the gourmet burger joints that I have tried. Me and the wife arrive around 1:30 pm after getting from Vegas. There was still a line which to me was a good sign since it was after the lunch period. We ordered the pork belly and duck steamed buns, sweet potato fries, while she got the Ronin burger and I got the Kiki Burger. All the items were top notch and we can't wait till the open a location in LA. A definite must try if you are near one!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki sauce and burger, is a bit too decadent for my taste.   Good flavors.  Just too rich for my palette.  Asian infusion for the foodie.   I'm a bit more good ol boy.   Good calamari.  But I wasn't a fan of the sauce.  Good service.  Decent atmosphere.   Should have a bar to sit at."}
{"text":"Great burgers, but not my favorite location. 

Environment: It was my first time coming to this location, and while it was the busiest of any other location I have been to, I would say it does not have the best interior. The floor plan is not very open and makes the restaurant feel a little long and disjointed as opposed to the more open floorplans of the other locations which I have been to. However, they do have different types of seating such as a patio and a bar which could appeal to some other types of people.

Food: As with any location of Bachi Burger, the burgers are great. My go-to is the Spicy Miso Burger, which has a fried egg and shishito peppers which are the standout ingredients in my opinion. Additionally, I have tried other burgers before and am delighted with each one. From the appetizer list the oxtail chili cheese fries are great and filling, however if you are looking for something lighter I would go for the pork belly bao buns which are nice and light and don't fill you up too much to the point where you won't be able to finish your burger. I have tried a couple cocktails here however I wouldn't particularly recommend them. They don't have a ton of flavor and are either too strong or too bland in my opinion.

Service: Service was okay, but not the best. After waiting and being sat the staff did seem like they were busy but it was somewhat unorganized, with multiple people coming up and trying to take our orders for different things, making it a little confusing to know who is exactly was our server. Despite this everyone was nice and personable and it is not something I would fault them for to the point where I would be deterred from coming again.

All in all, this location is closer to home for me, however I think I would rather wait to get Bachi Burger until a day I'm on the other side of town to go to another location just for the environment and the availability"}
{"text":"One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in!
It was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later.
Service was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly,
The menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection.
For starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect!
Onion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win!
Kids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score!
I had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy 
Not a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn't eat the salad, no bueno.
Much better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime Vinaigrette
Basically 3 veggie burgers in one.
The breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING!
There was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that!
My husband had the The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile. 
Portions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion.
Can't wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Windmill and the Sahara locations of Bachi Burger and love both!
Same great menu, same friendly staff, same style and decor.
This location does not get as full, if you are in a rush.
We stick with what we love here, the chili fried chicken, the onion rings and fries, the burger kids meal, the no meat here for me and my husband usually tries something different every time.
The flavors are so unique, there is really nothing else like Bachi Burger and that's why we keep coming back, wish they would expand to SoCal!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a hipster's burger joint. Great asian fusion burgers grilled to perfection. The dining area is actually a gallery of Japanese photography. 

I tried the Kiki Burger which was great since I'm a fan of burgers with mushrooms. The Garlic Chili Aioli that came with it was really tasty. 

I also tried the Crusty Crab Cake sandwich which was delicious. The crab cake was nice and thick and probably too much for the bread to hold. They really don't skimp on the amount of crab here. I also liked that they put avocado to pair with the crab cake. They also add mango and tangerine jam for a sweet contrast.

The sweet potatoe fries here are outstanding. Each one is crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

I'll need to stop by everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Over priced but delicious. I come often because the service never fails. If you come just know that they don't do combos. It's all separate unfortunately. So if you're looking for a place that's a bang for your buck you should avoid it! Good date spot:)"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and let me tell you that was one mean burger. I got the Black and Green Burger, and let me tell you that was amazing. The beef was really fresh, and I loved the bun/bread that was used. The creativity and diversity of burgers here was definitely interesting. However, the fries were a bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the freshness of the potato. On the other hand, I was disappointed with the milk tea. There was way more ice than drink, and so I'm feeling quite ripped off. I could buy a bigger milk tea for just as cheap elsewhere. Overall, I will come back for their burgers, but definitely not going to order their boba or milk tea again. A littler bit pricy for a burger, but it was definitely high quality."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation from a friend. Now I always stop here because their food is amazing. Ronin burger, banh mi burger and pork belly steamed buns are awesome. Tried their oxtail fries and it was pretty good though i still prefer the truffle and sweet potato fries but that's just my preference. Hands down, this is my fav burger spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for about 30min waiting for staff to come grab the check so my group and I can leave. Food is great and staff are friendly, but obviously not the most attentive. Great place to eat, just don't have anything planned for your day."}
{"text":"I went here with my BF and went here and the service was two thumbs up.  Since it was our first time Dan explained to us what their burgers were, which was most popular, etc.  I ordered the No Meat Here burger and that burger is super huge!!  I had to smash my burger in order to make it more proportioned.  Since it was a veggie burger the thing fell apart eventually.  It also contained some egg plant and fresh spinach (which is a big plus).

Dan was really attentive to our table and others as well and I appreciated that.  I'd definitely like to come back here and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been craving Bachi since the first time I've had it which was over a year ago. 

First time, I had the Spicy Miso burger which was yummy. 

This time I ordered the Miyagi-san Wagyu burger. I ordered it medium, cut it in half, and the first half I had was amazing! Perfect flavors with the meat, onion rings, egg, and furikake. The second half, however, went from medium well to over cooked pretty much. Disappointing...how did they cook a single patty two ways? Ha eh...made my taste buds feel yucky. Wish I ate that cooked side first. But it was still good. 

Two other friends and I shared the Oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer. It turns out it was a good thing the fries came out way before the burgers because I don't think we would have finished it all if it didn't. They were so tasty! 

I'm definitely gonna come back next time I'm in Vegas. Hopefully next time my burger will be medium all the way."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and decided to try it out. The oxtail fries were very good.We ordered a wagyu beef burger medium well and it was way over cooked the burger was very dry. I will try the location in Pasadena C.A. The service was good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ate.  I ordered Kiki's Burger.  The burger consists of a bun with a hint of sweetness, caramelized strip of bacon, several types of mushrooms and a sweet onion marmalade that balances out the burger perfectly. 

The Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries were very good but did not compare to the burger.

Finally, I also had a side of their oxtail chili. This is definitely something that should be ordered.  Lots of oxtail and cheese!  The beans were kept to a minimum.

Overall I found the food quality was superb.  My only gripe about the place is that it gives off a pretentious vibe.  The decor is lacking.  Walls are painted brown with a couple of TV's.

The wall above the kitchen area contains two chalkboards with some items of the menu written out.  Don't see the point in that as the words are too small and congested to make out unless you sit close.

On a final note, the chef making the burgers seemed to have a hard time getting the meat cooked properly when I was there.  I noticed three tables sending their burgers back due to incorrect temperature, including mine.

A positive experience overall and I definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I don't see the appeal in large burgers that slip and slide all over the place. I assume these flavors are to be eaten together, but how can this be executed when size intervenes?

The \"No Meat Here... Burger\" was the biggest target of gravity, and I ate most of it off the plate with a fork. 

The \"Banh-Mi Burger\" had good flavor intentions. I tried cutting it in half and squishing it down in order to have all components together, but my hands were a mess afterwards. It was one of the few times I wished for those wet-wipes at Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the last few years....I love the food, its very good...that said- the staff seems clueless each time I go....once a ton of ice was spilled by a server -five minutes went by- yes it was five minutes and nothing was done- finally I saw customers get on their hands and knees cleaning it up....HUH...I have seen similar stuff happen almost every time-this clearly comes from management- which is a family of brothers- one of the brothers has an interesting story involving his interactions with the us military but no need to discuss here...just yesterday I invited two close friends to go there as they live two minutes away...their answer- NO- then mentioned something about entomology and stuff (all of gods creatures have to eat-right)...if clueless service is not a deal breaker you will enjoy the adventure here...(this review has nothing to do with the BB server who once called me by a different name FIVE times during service...I corrected him once....DUDE...)"}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers. Came here after we finished a trade show in Vegas. Overall very delicious burgers. Shoe string fries had several dipping sauces, and burgers were cooked perfectly. Want to try the miyagi-San and sho-gun burgers next! Heard this is one of the best gourmet burger spots in Vegas and was featured on the food networks diners drive-ins and dives..."}
{"text":"We haven't been to this place in a while so we decided to try it again after a year. Well... I am extremely disappointed. It wasn't so much the food as it was the service. The service was absolutely horrendous. We got there at around 6:40 p.m. There were probably 3, maybe 4 tables that were already in use. They tried sticking us into a corner, which my mother said \"No way!\" We ordered our waters and drinks. We had to tell Gabby (our server - hoping that's her name) 3 times about the water. It didn't arrive for a good 8-10 minutes. She apologizes, saying that there were a lot of people and she was trying to keep up with everyone. ....Really? 3 tables was that overwhelming? She kept acting like she was extremely overwhelmed and flustered. We finally order our food. My mom got the Banh-Mi burger and I got Spicy Miso, as well as the truffle parmasean fries. That was another 20 minutes on top of the already 8-10 minutes of sitting there without anything. Not even the fries came out early. Two tables came after us and received their food faster than us. It was ridiculous. It wasn't even that busy in there! We finally got out at 7:20 p.m. Honestly, this was the worst service I've ever experience here. I will not be back any time soon, and she's lucky she even got a tip. The worst part was she was fully aware we were unhappy with the service and never asked \"What can I do to make this right?\" We don't want free crap, we want better service! Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions and I love it every time! Asian fusion hamburgers done right! If you're gonna add asian ingredients, GO ALL THE WAY! Don't just add teriyaki sauce to the same patty you use for your boring burgers.

Ronin Burger: I'm a loyal fan forever! The sauce that they give you just takes the burger to a whole other level. Dip it, drizzle it, drench it. Do it all and your mouth will reward you. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Why didn't anyone think of frying an egg and adding it on top before?! So yummy, although a few times I've had it I could tell the chili has been sitting on the stove all day. But I'd still eat it, and definitely share it with a group because you'll probably get a heart attack from how much calories are in this bad boy.

Banh Mi Burger: Those pickled veggies! YUMM-O!

Mr. Ho Burger?: I forget the name because I took a bite from my friend, but I think this one has taro bread which is definitely interesting if you love mixing savory sweet. Unfortunately I don't, but I'd definitely share this with someone just for a bite.  

Miyagi Burger: A little hyped up for my taste, but still pretty good compared to your average American hamburger.

Pork Belly Sliders: I've only had this once, and we took it to go because we were so stuffed. Didn't eat it until we were in our hotel room, where it was cold. Still tasted good, but I need to come back to taste it hot!

My sister also ordered the lychee soda also very good and interesting!

If you don't love Bachi Burger, you definitely should go to In-N-Out and add some teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"As a person who comes to Bachi often & orders the exact same thing every single time, let's just say I don't appreciate the little dispute I had with my waiter.... for something I've had multiple times, I know how it should taste. So why argue with me? Just take a back and let it go. On top of arriving here at 8:45 and being seated at 9:20, it is now 10:07 and my food has yet to arrive!!!! 

Let's move forward to it now being 10:23 and my food finally arrived...
Llet's talk about when my fried rice arrived and it was extremely SALTY! And when I say salty, I mean it literally only tasted like salt on rice  so I had that sent back and they were kind enough to remake it for me.. BUT when I received my ramen, it was just bitter. I assume they just decided not to put any salt on any of my food after sending the rice back. Like I said, I come here so often that I know how my food should taste because I ALWAYS ORDER THE SAME EXACT THING!!!! 

Surely enough, I ended up talking to a manager with my complaints and she was nice enough to ensure a better visit next time I come. Sadly, it was my best friends first time there and she was not impressed. I felt bad because I suggested this amazing place that never let's me down & is always great when I go, except for this one time!"}
{"text":"We had the oxtail chili cheese fries (11.5) and the kiki burger (10) for 25 on a friday night.

- Fancy. Restaurant style was inviting, spacious and slightly romantic. dim lighting;)
- Food presentation was perfect! Even the fries look symmetrical. lol. I loved the fried egg on top. I was a bit scared of the oxtail, too exquisite, but it was okay. a bit sweet. To compare, not as good as carne asada fries or the fries from buldogis.
- Burger was made medium and was very juicy and flavorful. It was also too sweet for me. 
- Bun came from in-n-out? haha
- AHEM...water please? haha
- Overall, the fusion was a bit strange. okay concept. I'd prefer just American or Korean fusion, but it's a good try for once. do it!"}
{"text":"Overhyped....or people are easily impressed.

Let's start off with the service.  The hostess was unorganized and kept fluttering about. There were plenty of open tables but my party of 2 was kept waiting for almost an hour. And then she sat a group of 4 that came in after us.  

We were finally sat at a table that had been open for about 20 minutes right next to the people they sat before us. The waitress then came and said she would bring us water, we didn't ask for water but she made the gesture that was never fulfilled until we finally reminded her.  Once we ordered we really didn't see her again until it was time to boot us off the table.  She did make speedy walk bys murming something but she would be gone before we could respond.

The food...many tables were ordering the ox tail chili on top of fries with an egg.  Woooooo (sarcasm). From the looks and smell, there is a fry truck that makes a brisket poutine (which this basically was) far better.

I ordered a double Angus burger with fried onion rings (tempura style), bacon (because the waitress made excuses as to why they could not add pork belly from their bahns whoch lead to the conclusion that the bahns were premade) and swiss.

They also offer waygu (which I suspect is not true or if it is its for those who would ruin a perfectly fine piece of meat and doing the ungodly things they did to their burgers).  Basically they grill their meat, whichever one you ordered and basted the hell out of it with hoison sauce.  Which brings me back to why order a waygu burger and then cover the flavor with a hoison bbq sauce? 

And my friend got the waygu, it was tough and when I asked how it was he said he liked it. How was the meat? I just taste the sauce.

The fries are run of the mill, but you can get the truffle ones for those eaters who succumb to those parlor tricks.

In the end Bachi Burger isn't the worst burger joint I have been to, but far from the better ones.  Most people will probably like it (like the group next to us whose buzz words were \"waygu\" and \"truffle oil\"), but they also like Ed Hardy shirts, think Mercedes-Benz are awesome cars, and have rocked out to \"What Does The Fox Say\"."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I had the green and blue burger and it was amazing! The bun is delicous. Also loved the salt and pepper fries. Will be going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Wa tada the wonderful. I could eat here every day. Variety only eclipsed by the quality. Top notch food and service. You must go now! Makes Umami B. seem very ordinaire!"}
{"text":"The wait can be ridiculous but  I always get VIP treatment and not have to wait EVER. Unlimited iced matcha green tea and cherry yuzu soda, FTW! They have specials: crab dip and manga burger. Some make it to the regular menu, some don't. My faves include: shogun burger, miyagi san burger, Kiki's burger, steamed buns (pork belly or duck), sausage and truffle parmesan fries.

Shogun Burger:
Wagyu Beef, unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear,  miso butter  and Yamamomo peach on the side. It's very rich and fatty but oh, so delicious! It's worth the $26! 5/5

Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns/ Pork Belly Steamed Buns: 
Duck Breast, cilantro, scallions,  radish,  boiled egg, Hoisin BBQ sauce. The buns are fluffy and the duck skin is nice and crisp, the duck meat is tender and juicy. Pork Belly is fatty good. 5/5

Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage:
Sausages with a side of honey mustard. A great appetizer. 5/5

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries:
With garlic aioli  and fried egg on top. The chili itself is a bit sweet for my taste. Not my favorite thing on their menu but it's still good and worth a try. 4/5

Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries:
Sprinkled with Maui onion sea salt  and garlic chili aioli on the side. The dipping sauce is good, the fries are ok. 3/5

Truffle Parmesan Fries:
Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side. This is one of my favorite fries in Vegas/Henderson. Very tasty! 5/5

Ronin Burger:
Angus beef with caramelized onions, coleslaw,  miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and  yuzu aioli. Refreshing because of the yuzu and rich beacause of the egg. 5/5

Kiki's Burger:
Angus Beef  with sautéed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade,  Gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.

Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger:
Wagyu beef with chili mayo,  fried egg,  furikake, caramelized bacon,  fried onion rings. This and the Shogun burger are the best burgers on their menu. It's a thich burger so you have to cut it in half and press it down just so it would fit in your mouth. 5/5"}
{"text":"For the longest time, every time I went to vegas and wanted a restaurant recommendation people have been recommending this place and I was always skeptical. I finally gave this place a try and it definitely did not disappoint. This place wasn't super packed when I got there but after my friend and I sat down, it got crowded super fast. The place is nice and clean and had a bunch of TV's playing the local sports teams. The service was pretty good and the food quality was definitely top notch! 

We ordered chili cheese fries but it came with a sunny side up egg on top of it. Anything with a sunny side up egg is instantly that much better, this definitely helped! I don't remember which burger I ordered but I had it medium rare and it came out pretty near perfect. 

Overall the quality was great and the service was tremendous. Really have no complaints about this place. The price was more than reasonable. 

I would say the only bad thing about this place is the distance from the strip. You really have to go out of your way to get to this place and it's definitely not a short drive. 

Tips: 
1) Try the fries
2) Happy hour milkshakes
3) Enjoy"}
{"text":"One of the most pleasant dining experience of my life. Steamed pork buns are excellent."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger can be summed up in a few words: Creative, Inventive, and Yum.

I've been wanting to try this place. My friends have raved about it, my fellow Yelpers have raved about it, so when I had a burger craving, I drove across town and gave it a go! And I was not disappointed!

We started off with the pickled appetizer. It was light, different, and delicious. My favorite was the pickled garlic. Divine! Some of the other pickled options were alright, but the garlic blew my mind.

I got Kiki 's Burger which had a carmalized onion, bacon marmalade and two types of Asian mushrooms. It was great, but the way the patty was put together was odd. It had a sweet taste to it. It was odd, different, and good. I just wasn't expecting a sweet burger. 

I paired my burger with the Truffle Parmesan fries. They were delicious and crispy. What I didn't like was that the truffles and Parmesan were all pilled on top of the fries instead of mixed all the way through.

Of course, being the foodie I am, I had to try a dessert. I ordered the Portuguese donuts, with Vietnamese Cinnamon, and Coffee gelato.  The donuts that are dusted with cinnamon is a divine heavenly combo. It's melt in your mouth delicious. I would only order this is you are a coffee fan because individually the items are okay, but when paired together, your socks will be rocked off!

Bachi Burger was inventive, fun, and reasonably priced. The inside of the restaurant was clean and their was adequate seating. I will definitely be back to try more Bachi amazingness!"}
{"text":"burger was okay. 

service: bad. We were checked on once and that was so the rude waiter could take our order. He just wanted to fool around with his friends in the back. They were yelling and laughing.

Save your money go to smashburger or fuddruckers."}
{"text":"Very good burger. Prices are bad friendly place to eat. Filling and delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was our first and probably worst time at Bachi Burger on Windmill and very mismanaged. First, they only had Coke and Diet Coke available for beverages. Their Oxtail fries were delicious and came out almost immediately. Then, chaos!!! Two chefs started to fight in the kitchen, one of whom was cussing profusely and throwing F bombs multiple times to be heard by ALL customers including my 7 year old. Of course, after these clowns settled down, it took almost an hour to get our burgers and when they came out, my burger had a cardboard stub in it. Manager wasn't on duty but this store absolutely needs onsite supervision and the employees need to be disciplined. The supervisor who happen to be the floor supervisor was very apologetic and comp'ed my burger and drink but this wasn't enough to us to go back. Food just didn't go down with all the fuss and 3 hour sitting. Food and service always suffer when there are bad employees."}
{"text":"The Ronin Burger was one of the best I've ever had.  Combined with the Ox Tail fries, and you get a pretty ideal American meal."}
{"text":"so excited to try bachi from all the great reviews.  its in a strip mall and we smell theoven delicious aroma from the parking lot.   
when we walked in I was a lil surprised at how small it was inside. but we were seated within 5 minutes and ordered edamame... truffle parmesan fries. the kimchi burger and the bacon burger with blue cheese... forgot what it was called.  both medium.

the edamame was standard. the fries were super thin and crisp... we didn't care for the porcini sauce on top... it would have taste so much better without it... the kimchi kalbi Burger was inside cooked perfectly .but the outside was burnt.. for the rest of the burger nothing really stood out.  eating it was quite messy and the side of cucumber kimchee was disappointing... soggy and not that spicy.  

my man had the blue cheese bacon burger and again.. cooked perfectly medium and tasty but nothing mind blowing...  

we were stuffed after our meal but nothing to write home about... I rather so fukuburger or slidn thru..."}
{"text":"First of all the food was great!  Unfortunately I had to enjoy it from a box at my desk at work because the service was awful!  We arrived with only two other parties seated in the restaurant.  Not only did it take 15 minutes to place our order but two other guests who arrived after us got their food before us. We actually had our to go boxes waiting at our table before our food arrived.   Had just enough time to dump our food in our to go boxes, leave hopefully enough cash to cover the bill (didn't even have that in a timely manner) and hustle out the door to get back to work.   All in all we were in the restaurant for approximately an hour.   Service was terrible.   At least four other parties wisely left before getting seated because they has already waited 15 minutes or more.   Hopefully management reads this and makes some staffing adjustments because the chicken curry salad was fabulous."}
{"text":"This place is great. We came in 20 minutes before closing on a Sunday after the opera, and they gave us great service! The oxtail fries were so good and the ramen hit the spot!! Anytime we visit Vegas we will definitely stop in!! Thank you all!"}
{"text":"The second visit to Bachi Burger was not as good as the first visit. Not bad. Just not as great as we initially thought. ...I'm not a fan of their ketchup. ...Wifey said her chicken/turkey burger was good but not great."}
{"text":"I have never had a burger with Japanese flavours until this place and I was amazed. Prices are a little high but worth it and this location is by far better than any of the others because of the expanded menu you get from ramen ya that shares the space."}
{"text":"My fifth time here. I finally weened my way from the Kiki burger and had the Spicy Miso burger. Both are delish. Added some truffle fries to the mix and a Green Milk Tea and I was set.
Next time; the Ronin and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with my food here or at any Bachi Burger location. The food is always amazing to say the least. But the service is almost sub par. When we received our appetizer, we weren't given plates to eat it on, or silverware to eat it with. 
Our waiter didn't come to check on us at all the whole time we ate. Someone else brought our food, and someone else filled our water glass, ONCE. We waited quite a while for our check. All the servers were in the back chatting amongst themselves I saw none of them out checking on any tables at all. It was happy hour and no one told us or gave us a menu, we found it out in our own. I myself am a server, I do this for a living and I was embarrassed by the lack of pride taken by the wait staff. This is not the first time I have had below average service at the Summerlin location. 

As I look at the reviews it seems I am not the only one who notices the bad service. I hope it catches on and something is done to fix it."}
{"text":"Bachi never ceases to provide some of the best fusion burgers I've ever had. I just ordered the oxtail fries which are always good and the Alaskan cod fish burger. The cod was moist and not dry, if u like cod like I do. Give this burger a try, especially with lent approaching. 
If you are an American burger fan this might not be your place. If u have an ounce of foodie adventurer in you. You should love this place. Bring friends an excellent place to hang."}
{"text":"Shared the Kiki's burger and oxtail chili cheese fries with a friend and it was enough to fill us both up! Big portions and a great price point too.  The burger was perfectly juicy, but the oxtail fries were definitely my favorite.  We were in awe of the huge plate when it was set in front of us, but had NO problem at all polishing off every last delicious potato stick! 

Definitely worth the drive if you're looking to switch up your food options with places other than the strip. For all you LA-yelpers, apparently they are opening one on Sawtelle!"}
{"text":"These Asian fusion flavors will make an indelible impression on any burger fan willing to branch out and try something different. In fact, many food critics say \"Bachi Burger\" might just be the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas (which is a pretty bold statement considering all the burger joints on the Strip backed by famous chefs). 

Burger \"connoisseurs\" unwilling to experiment any further than some avocado or pepper jack, however, might be scared off by this menu. For instance, the Ronin Burger features Angus beef, carmelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso-Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli. The Banh-Mi Burger includes Angus beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, pickled vegetables, and Nuoc Mam sauce.

Don't be intimidated, though -- there are other options for those with simpler tastes and you can always build your own burger by starting off with an Angus patty or Wagyu patty and adding ingredients from there. Fried onion rings, applewood bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, etc can all be added to any patty for $1.50 each.

There are also a variety of different sandwiches to choose from and I could honestly fill up on the fries alone. The oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and fried egg are extremely popular, but the more traditional fries are also a big hit -- mainly because of the savory sauces that accompany them. The garlic chili aioli, Yuzu citrus aioli, sundried tomato aioli and pineapple ketchup are all HIGHLY recommended for dipping or drowning the fries of your choice (the options are regular, garlic, sweet potato, and truffle Parmesan).

If you're not much of an adventurous diner, you'll probably stay away from Bachi Burger. Your taste buds will definitely be missing out, though."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious, no question. Service is inconsistent as some servers are great, but some are slack and almost rude."}
{"text":"Stopped in and was waited on by Adrian, he recommended the Ho Burger and it was bomb! Make sure you ask for Adrian his service is on point you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are under the impression that the duck was not thoroughly cooked. Approximately two hours after writing the review, I experienced food poisoning. We did not eat or drink anything else before or after dining here. My boyfriend solely ate the red meat and french fries and was feeling perfectly fine which leads us to believe that the duck was the reason for the vomiting."}
{"text":"Wow, love, love, love Bachi Burger.  We started with the steamed duck buns. . . I have never liked duck until NOW.  I would eat these yummy puffs of delight EVERY Day!  I had the salmon burger, he had the cod burger and both were fantastic.  THIS is how any fish sandwich should taste, PERIOD!  Fresh flavors and seafood with sauce that doesn't over power the flavors.  

We like Bachi Burger so much we went back again today, I had the crab cake burger, he had a house burger.  The crab cake was light and fluffy, with nice lumps of crab, the chutney it is served with compliments the crab perfectly and leaves a spicy/sweet taste in its wake.  Mmmmm!  The burger he ordered was perfect, I have never had a better burger, REALLY, never.  Bachi Burger is doing it right, you will pay for the quality and fresh flavors but it is sooooo worth it.  ENJOY, I will be back next week!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best experiences I've had food wise plus the service was impeccable. Run to try this place."}
{"text":"This is our first Triple Ds joint and it did not disappoint. Great food and good service. Oxtail chili cheese fries- sweet, and savory oxtail goes really well with the crunchy texture of the fries.  Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage- it was just ok. Pork Belly Steamed Buns- although pretty fatty looking but it just melts in your mouth, the hoisin dipping sauce is too salty for my taste, should be more on a sweeter side. The Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger- very good, soft and light sweet buns compliments the burger perfectly. Shogun burger- a monster burger with foie gras, unagi, and pear. 
Overall a very good restaurant, will definitely come back to try their other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Okay, I was a little skeptical coming here- because most of the reviews I read were pretty mediocre, BUT...

BACHI BURGER WAS FANTASTIC!!! I PLAN ON VISITING REGULARLY IN THE FUTURE, I am SO happy I ate lunch there today. 

Jill was our server & she was so sweet! Great staff!!! I could tell they were starting to get a little busy when all of the tables filled up a few moments after we ordered, regardless we were given just as much attention as we would have if they were empty. Genuinely great service!

The Parmesan Truffle Fries were outstanding!!! A sun dried tomato aioli was served beside the fries, it was perfect for dipping & complimented all of the complex flavors of the dish. 

I ordered the smallest BBQ Bachi Burger, which was actually quite large- for something priced at only $6. I took some of it home with me, & I can't wait to eat it for a midnight snack. THE BUN- very oriental, & delightfully toasted. My boyfriend & I were extremely satisfied with our burgers (identical, only his was 7 oz, mine was 5 oz). 

To anyone who has complained about their presentation- lets get real here, you probably pay $6 for a large combo at McDonalds- did you complain about their presentation too? I liked the simplicity, I would rather my food taste extravagant than just look that way. =]

I have 3 adjectives for them- mouthwatering, cutting edge, & hospitable."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem. It's probably the best, most innovative burger joint I have ever been to.

A group of 5 of us came in and we ordered:
kalbi burger, grilled bachi fish, spicy miso burger (special), and kiki's burger.

It took about 20 min to come out and it was well worth the wait. We sampled each others burger and they all brought a different taste to each. Very fresh and very juicy for burgers cooked to medium. Kalbi burger had a small kick to it, and tasted like the bachi pickles appetizers you find in korean restaurants. Kiki's burger tasted like a mushroom and swiss, but gourmet. It almost tastes like they steam the patties! My fav was the grilled bachi burger. The sauce was tangy and the fish was really mild and soft. Not overcooked at all. The spicy miso burger consisted of radish sprouts, the patty, and a miso sauce that just mixes together so well.

We opted for the portugese donuts with green tea ice cream. It was a nice ending to the meal. Came out piping hot and the ice cream complemented it well.

Definitely coming back for the wagyu burgers in a couple days."}
{"text":"Delicious 1st (take-out) experiance here! Miyagi-san burger and sweet potatoe fries hit the spot..Service was very fast, friendly and I look forward to returning again soon! highly recommended....yum!"}
{"text":"The burger is well worth the wait. They have a huge variety of burgers and even some specialty items.
- Kalbi burger - it was ginormous and messy (might be personal issues but whatevs). i liked the kimchi with the burger and wish there was more kimchi. the pickled cucumbers on the side was a nice touch.. too bad they don't give refills like banchan :p
- truffle fries - their aoili was delish and the fries were crispy
- sweet potato fries - crispy fries but i didnt like th dipping sauce too much

i'll certainly be back to try some other items on a night when i dont have to try to stuff myself into a dress."}
{"text":"Warning, DO NOT get the boba tea. They make it with some nasty powdered creamer (per the waitress) and it results in a gross thick consistency. I got the papaya and it had no taste. They could have at least opened a Goya can and poured some papaya juice in.  I am fuming that I paid 4.5 dollars for that slop.

That being said, the burgers and sweet potato fries are really good and worth a return for. I got the bachi burger and it was well-seasoned and juicy."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is amazing. I'll be here again and again. We enjoyed the shogun burger ($26) waygu beef, bone marrow appetizer and ox tail chili fries.
The Burger was worth every cent. The combo of flavors is unique and blended well. I was pleasantly surprised with the unagi. The bone marrow was wonderfully decadent. The fries are delish but I would pass next time. I think these offer the 'full' feeling the restaurant is trying to push. I will come back to discover a better alternative."}
{"text":"Order the banh mi burger and the house pickles. Must try items on the menu. The shogun was fine, but (understandably) pricey and not as good as the banh mi. Worth a try once though"}
{"text":"If you really want me to get to the point: you can get a better and cheaper burger at Five Guys. 

For being a \"gourmet\" burger place I kinda got my hopes up. Strike one was that my mom mentioned to the server that we don't eat pork meat (but we can tolerate pepperoni in small doses) but still brought our appetizer with pork mixed in. She said that it stated it had pork sausage but it's not like my family had any idea what the heck the name of that sausage meant it was a pork sausage but whatever.

When our food came our burgers were dry and kinda overcooked. Both my dad and I asked for medium rare so it's a shame seeing wagyu getting cremated that way. It was still edible and besides it wasn't cheap so I wasn't gonna waste it (plus the hangry-ness needed to chill out).

If I gotta say something positive their momowhatever peach strawberry soda is really good.

Anyways, long story short if you want a good burger worth the money there is other cows in the sea... or something like that."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff serves up some of the most exotic tasting burgers I have ever tried with The Banh-Mi being the most flavorful of them all. Not in the mood for a burger? Try any of their amazing starters! The steamed pork buns, oxtail fries and truffle fries are always awesome treats to share with friends. BTW, if you get the truffle fries, get a side of the pineapple ketchup and the porcini sauce...the flavors are truly amazing."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! This unassuming restaurant serves some of the most amazing flavors I have ever tasted on a bun. From their truffle fries, to the dipping sauces, to the delicious texture and flavor of the buns, to the amazing concoction of flavors they serve up...everything is scrumptious. 

This place is great for a casual dinner with friends or even an intimate dinner with your significant other. The staff is very friendly and the prices are not bad at all."}
{"text":"I'd have to say, I've been to this restaurant many times since it opened. As far back that I actually have had the meat based meals on their menu. Bison is amazing and if you haven't had the pleasure, do try it! 

As a vegetarian, Bachi isn't really pinging a lot of my interest due to MOST of the menu items are meat based in some way. (Sauces, bacon, burgers, etc...) 

When I have business meetings or want to enjoy a clean atmosphere, its a great go-to and the \"No Meat Here\" burger option is really tasteful. 

Today's missteps finally reached a pinnacle that forced me to speak to it. At the end of the day, you would think this establishment would have worked toward elevating the offering. Bachi is known. From TV spots to publications, its no question of how they rose to success. 

The tide is changing though and its time to really move into an offering that accommodates more healthy eating choices fused with the traditional flavors Bachi already presents. 

Heres my complaints: 

Was out of the best vegetarian option which is the \"No Meat Here\" burger. Worst part is Dillon was quite unapologetic about it. Staff should really look to turn around a let down like that in a better way and not default to \"there's a salad\". (We're tired of hearing it really) 

Next, simple requests like iced water, appetizers out before entrees fell completely waist side. Speed of service is still a big deal, especially during a busy Friday lunch hour in a large commercial area. 

The ask: 

More Vegetarian options or enthusiasm to accommodate and reinvent for the customer on the spot. Work with the customer, explore the ingredients you have and come up with something fun! You never know, it may end up on your menu and a popular favorite. I've met so many chefs and cooks willing to take their skill challenge to new levels so I would think this is a fairly attractive opportunity. 

Last, hire exceptional people. They should be excited to bring an experience for the traveler, business person and foodies that come in purely on reputation. The negative effect of an experience can cause ripples in this current world. Easy misstep with long term effects."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives & decided to try it. I was leery because it is a different combination of tastes, but I must say, bar-none, this was the BEST burger ever. A fantastic combination of flavors, juicy, fresh & hot! And the sauce they served with the burger was great! Highly recommend, one will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Very good!  Was recommended to me and they were right! The place is in a strip mall but the vibe, menu and food would suggest it's a terrific restaurant on the strip. I'll be back."}
{"text":"3 years later, I decide to give this place another shot while in town - since the last time, they merged with a ramen restaurant next door, so while there are a few more seats, there are also 3 menus

The Banh-mi burger was very tasty, and a 2 napkin burger at least.  The garlic fries - nothing special, the garlic didn't even stick to the fries, it was all down at the bottom of the cone.  The sauce that the fries came with did have good flavor, but you only get enough for about half of the fries

All in all - some of the food is very well done and flavorful.  The prices are a bit high for that far off of the strip.  don't see a need to hurry back"}
{"text":"Customer Service was good so moving onto food...

1) Taro Coconut Milk Tea with Boba 5/5- very unique and delicious! You get a good balance of the Taro and Coconut. It's not too sweet and just right!

2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries 2.5/5- It was heavy, I was expecting more savory and salty but this dish is on the sweeter side (probably because of the Asian fusion). With it being sweet and heavy, it made it very difficult for me to enjoy this dish. Half way finishing this plate, the rest of the fries were soaked in this sauce and I could not bare to eat anymore of it.

3) Pork Belly Steamed buns 4/5- It was my favorite thing here! The pork belly was juicy and flavorful, the sauce it came with is just right for it.

4) The Bachi Burger 4/5- Pretty delicious especially if you like kim chi. I was scared that there might be too much going on but I was wrong. Everything complemented each other well. I kind of wish my burger was a little more juicier. I ordered a medium but felt like it was on the borderline of a medium well.

Overall, this place is okay. Almost all items have some sweetness to it and it's probably because of the Asian infused flavors. I think some of plates were too complicated and involved too many ingredients/toppings. Sometimes simplicity is good."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday evening, the place was empty. Maybe about 6 tables were occupied. Took about 5 minutes before a server came to the table. Let's just say the service had to be coaxed the entire meal. And my glass was empty for a good 10 minutes. In short service sucks.

Food was ok. For starters we had the Kurobuta & Arabiki sausage with grain mustard, which was good, but nothing to brag about, it reminded me of a skinny kielbasa flavored beef smokies garnished with shreds of scallion, which does nothing to enhance the flavor . Also had the Truffle Parmesan fries with sundried tomato aioli. The fries needed salt, and the drizzling of porcini cream was unecesary, it only made the fries get soggy faster in places. They should've stopped with truffle oil and salt. The aioli was forgettable. 

Now comes the burger, Miyagi-San burger was pretty good, although for me, flavor wise, it was incomplete. Sure, it has all the umami-ness needed to tickle the palate, Wagy beef, fried onion rings, fried egg over medium. Unfortunately it needed acid to cut the richness of the burger. So my tip is to order the Bachi pickles while you order your burger, so they come the same time. The pickles is by far the most epic plate of the evening. It was seasoned perfectly, the veggies have a nice crunch to them specially the pickled garlic. 

I'd go again with friends like after work, but I won't expect much"}
{"text":"This review is for service only, as we didn't get a chance to be seated. There were only 3 other patrons dining in the restaurant, while 4 or 5 small parties were waiting to be seated. Hostess said that it would be about a 20-35 minutes wait. Like I said, only 3 parties were seated. When asked the reason for the long wait, the hostess politely replied that it was because everyone arrived at the same time. ????
We tried. We tried to give Bachi Burger another try after many years of frequenting there. They've gone downhill fast with their service. It's too bad because their product is delicious. Our last experience there over a year ago was a disaster with snarky service. This time, their service was rather lacking, but with a smile. That won't keep my loyalty. Bye~bye, Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"The line is a bit slow to get through. The service is on the slow side, which explains the long waits. However, once you get in, the burgers are absolutely awesome. I had the Miyagi-san. Which seemed like \"everything on it\" type of burger. It was extremely juicy and tender.We did experience that they cook their meat one level above. I asked for medium and got medium well. We also order medium rare and the burgers came out medium.... so, try one one level bellow what you normally get.Not sure if it was the day or that's how they cook them, need to go again to check difference doneness. The sauces they offer for the fries are unique and quite tasty. We also order the ox tail fries... I want that ox tail stew by itself... its is quite awesome."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas , take the Uber to this gem. I had the oxtail chili cheese fries...wow. Follow that up with the myagi San waygu burger and and ice cold sopporo. The hardest part is choosing from the menu. I'm coming back for the moco loco"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE - I wish that staff was a bit more outgoing and friendly; Nonetheless, the food was amazing. We will definitely return again on our text visit to Vegas. Wow - a much! We really enjoyed our visit. Excellent quality food."}
{"text":"Let me tell you...those oxtail fries are the best fries I've ever had! Hands down!  Yes it's crazy rich and I probably won't be able to eat this on the regular, but it was definitely worth the calories.  The banh mi burger resembles a banh mi impeccably.  The Ronin burger wasn't that special to me and forgettable.  I enjoyed the Kalbi burger and Banh Mi more."}
{"text":"This has been the best gourmet hamburger place that I have been so far.  Still like in n out burgers but these were pretty good.  There were so many choices on the menu i wanted to try a lot fo them.  I don't live near one so I can only get it in Vegas, for now so I wanted to pick the right burger.  Unfortunately this may not be a place I would go to because there are other places I rather go to when i am in town. The onion rings and fries were pretty good.  The aioli sauce is delicious.  I saw the ox tail chili fries It looked pretty big as you see in the photos but not worth the 12.00 to me.  If you want to get something juicy and favorable try their burgers.  I ordered the hamburger medium.  It was perfect..  My friend likes the Kalbi burger but you will have to like kim Chee because that takes over the burger (my friend got the kim chee on the side).  It is not that spicy according to my friend who does not like spicy food.  I didnt go with her so I didnt get to taste it.  We went there the next day I shared my burger with my husband it was filling for us.   I got the Ronin Burger and it was yu,mmy.   My son enjoyed his meal and plans to go back.  I think he will try the kiki burger the next time.  A good hamburger place with good service.  It took a little long but it is made fresh."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why people rave about this place! We've been here three times or more and have not enjoyed it any of the times. The most recent time was terrible. 

We arrived and the place was empty meaning literally no one was there. We arrived a few minutes before two members in our party and they refused to seat us until our whole party arrived. We sat in the front of the restaurant with nobody coming in until our party arrived. Lame! When we finally sat down they took forever to come over to give us our drinks. One person in my party wanted well-done meat but the server insisted that he get it medium-well. He insisted that well-done was not good and wouldn't let him ruin their meat. 

I ordered the kids chicken nuggets (for my kid) which are called something else I realize but let's be honest it's glorified chicken nuggets. He badgered me for a few minutes telling me 'oh these aren't chicken nuggets they are much more'. Get over yourself! 

Finally the food came out after more then 45 minutes--Remember the restaurant was at this point almost empty--and they brought out the adult food first. Then more then 10 minutes after they brought all the adult food the kids food came... Uh what the heck! Sure my 4 and 2 year old are super patient and waited very well for almost an hour for their food uh not! 

The food was bland and almost flavorless. The salt & pepper fries had no pepper and whatever other toppings were listed as being a part of it were not there! My black & green burger basically tasted like meat with a stale bun. It was supposed to have blue cheese (the reason I ordered it!) but no cheese to be found. I should have returned it but I really didn't have 55 more minutes to wait for a new burger and didn't want to talk to the condescending server about food again. On a side note the music was loud and awkward. It did not fit the lunch crowd! 

This isn't out first bad experience here, but it will be our last! Service-terrible. Food-bland. Atmosphere-loud and awkward. Prices-extremely high for what you get. Highly disappointing $60 for a terrible lunch!"}
{"text":"Very good \"burger meets asian fusion\" joint.  I like that they had both Asahi and Sapporo options.
Burger was big and done like I asked --- med rare.    Order sweet potato fries --- cooked perfectly crunchy outside soft inside -- but i didn't care for the sauce that came with it - ketchup was fine for me.

Pretty fast service --- but it was early in the lunch hour.    I used the bar - but there are table and booth options.  If you like sports tv -- they have it on.

Parking super easy -- but there is a lot of construction across the road, so watch out for construction trucks, etc.

Menu straight forward and simple --- pick one of their combos or do a make your own burger.

Meat was fresh and very tasty.    Super casual or good for date night.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can you say over rated. I have noticed any place that's featured on a tv show like diners  dives and drive ins is avoid. The restaurant was busy and waited about 20 min during lunch rush. I didn't like the place as soon as I walked in. It felt like a night club with the music blaring. I don't mind some mood music but when I have to shout to have a conversation then there's a problem. 

Let's get to the food, ordered the oxtail chili with very little meat for $15 it was decent but not $15 good for some fries and chilli.

There was three of us and we all ordered different burgers. The problem with the fish burger was that the fish fell apart as you ate the burger so the fish was basically falling off the buns. The mr ho burger had way too much sauce on it and my grandma couldn't eat it. The problem with these burgers were that they were way to busy, multiple sauces that conflict with the burger itself. 
I felt for the price the burger could have been bigger. Lunch for three over $60.
I also thought their non alcohol specialty drinks were way over priced."}
{"text":"I kept hesitating to come to this burger joint because from several people that has been here said they didnt like it.  So, I never would come here when Brad T. would suggest it until one day, Im like \"what the hell, why not?\"

& Lo and behold!! I have fallen in love with this burger joint.  Was I imagining how great this burger (Miyagi-san's Grass Fed WagyuBurger) was! DELISH! We also ordered the:
Salt & PepperGarlic French Fries & the Truffle ParmesanFries.  The truffle fries & you dip it into the sauce that goes with it.  It is absolute heaven, never tasted a fry that is so addicting (besides Mcds fries, lol) I can eat probably two orders of the truffle fries. 

The service was superb, he was very friendly and recommended some things that we should try out next time we were there.

The ONLY reason why, I took away a star because I ordered Thai tea & coffee ice cream.  The thai tea was completely watered down, it tasted horrible. The coffee ice cream cost about $2.99 (I believe) it was soo tiny! 

However, I would definitely come back here but I probably would never order the thai tea or ice cream again."}
{"text":"No matter how much I pretend to not be a burger person, every time my friends want to go to one of these joints, I end up enjoying myself. There is always a stigma that burgers and fries are unhealthy. I won't try to refute it, but you can learn to overlook it for a great piece of Americana especially when you spice it up with an international twist. 

The interior of this place resembles that of an industrial art gallery. The mute walls are complimented with bright splashes of  Asian photography. The numerous lights above you do not flood the area with an obnoxious florescent feel, but emanates enough light to make it feel cozy. The earth tone place mates gives a warm contrast to the otherwise concrete room.

Did you know that I was on a search for the perfect balls? Yes, they serve boba tea here and I am impressed. The tapioca were smaller than I am used to, but they have the right amount of chewiness, so they did not turn into spitballs. The taro milk tea was perfect; the richness of the taro, the creaminess of the milk, and the right amount of sweetness. My friend ordered the jasmine milk tea. I normally tend to avoid plain milk teas because the tea tend to go M.I.A. Not the case here. The jasmine is ever present and bold. Flowery and aromatic, I would order this again. If they had durian, I would be here more often. For $3.50, I can come here to get my boba fix and save the gas money. Who am I kidding? I would end up in Chinatown anyways.

I walked in, expecting to get gouged, but found their prices reasonable. My dining partner and I split a Ronin burger and a Kiki burger. The meat used in these patties are moist and flavorful. The thick slabs of meat were definitely the star, but let the accoutrement boost it up. The Ronin burger is topped with an Asian slaw, fried egg, and pickled ginger. When I first bit into it, I was thrown off, and taken aback. The ginger can be off putting, but after the second bite it got better. By the time you had a few bites it is delicious. This burger is messy because the egg is over easy and the yolk will burst when you pick it up. The Kiki burger was perfection from the first taste. The mixed greens, bacon, and sauteed onions did not distract nor overpower the burger. The BBQ sauce did not mask any imperfections, but bound everything together. With an order of sweet potato fries this was a magnificent meal even for the \"indifferent\" burger consumer I pretend to be."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get my husband to try this place since it opened on the west side...it's hard to tear him away from Buldogi's which is in the same shopping center!
We stopped in for a weekday lunch. There were only a couple other tables with customers. Service was fast, friendly and helpful. She answered all our newbie questions and patiently waited for our decisions.
I decided on the Miyagi-san burger since I wanted to try their Wagyu beef. I had it cooked medium to their recommendation. I loved the bun! I think my burger and egg were over cooked. So my burger was a bit dry and I was hoping for a nice runny yolk egg on my burger. It was tasty but not all that special. I had a bite of my husbands burger which was had an Angus beef burger and we both agree it didn't seem any different from my more expensive beef. Disappointing. My husband got the Spicy Miso burger also cooked to their recommendation, his burger and egg were cooked better than mine. It was an interesting burger, good taste. My husband wished it was spicier, he thinks the egg made it bland. We shared some Truffle Parmesan fries, they were okay. Again nothing special. The fries were nice and crispy and not greasy, but not a lot of taste. I liked the Porcini cream on top but there wasn't enough, I didn't care for the Sun dried Tomato AiolI dip. My husband had the complete opposite feeling on the sauces.
The prices are pretty similar to other gourmet burger places in town.
I'd go back if some one wanted to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. I would definitely order something else, there are some yummy sounding selections on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and when I requested an extra well done burger with NO PINK, my waiter said the burgers are already kinda burnt, but he can ask well done. When my burgers finally arrive.... Cut it open and it's damn near rare:/ so I had to wait longer for a well done burger...."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  Truffle fries was only so so.  Pork belly buns was an inventive and delicious play on the traditional duck buns.  Will come back for some solid creative burgers, but not sure about the truffle fries...may improve with more truffle."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not, the best burger joint in Vegas. Coming from the Midwest where the burgers are really popular, this is by far one of my favorites. 

My first time here was a great experience, I ordered a Miyagi-san and some oxtail fries and it was really good. My 2nd time here, Paul introduced himself as a personable GSM. Another worker named Adrian was working the bar and they both recommended the Shogun Burger (picture below), and I'll tell ya, IT WAS WORTH THE PRICE. Both members are really helpful, the service are great, and the place is really clean. If you are in town, I definitely recommend to stop by and check out Bachi!"}
{"text":"We ate at Bachi Burger on our last night in Vegas. It was definitely worth the wait. Actually Diane didn't understand why I was so excited to try a Burger Place. Just like a lot of other Yelpers, I've wanted to try this place since seeing it on Food Network.

When we got there the hostess said there was a 25 minute wait. No problem! We'll just sit at the Bar. By the time I could order my Kambei Cocktail (Sake,Vodka, Pineapple Juice, Cherry, Orange Juice and Mint), the manager Ronnie, who was very nice and energetic, had a table for us.

We quickly ordered The Black & Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sautéed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese and Roasted Garlic. The Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette and Hoisin BBQ Sauce. The Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries with Maui Onion Sea Salt and Garlic Chili Aioli. As our server left with our order, we decided to add an order of the Bachi House Made Pickles.

Everything was wonderful. The flavor combinations were interesting and unique, while the different textures sent things to another level. Our favorite item was the Bachi Pickles. Instead of Cucumbers they used different products like Seaweed, Carrots, Garlic Cloves, Asian Peppers, Watermelon Rinds and Ginger Shoots. We both decided that next visit we'd skip the Fries and get two orders of the Pickles. Bachi is wheelchair accessible and the Staff was quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Bachi Burger is getting added to my list of must visit Vegas spots!"}
{"text":"I went to this Bachi Burger location last night for the first time, for their reverse happy hour on a Thursday night. They had a DJ and a live artist painting which was awesome! I really liked the $5 Seasonal Sangria, and loved my boyfriend's $6 Spiked Caramel Milkshake. We split a few apps and my favorite was definitely the sweet potato fries, but everything tasted great. Our bill for 3 of us with a drink or 2 each and a few apps was extremely reasonable at $47. Service was great too and the manager Joe is the best! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! After seeing this yummy burger spot featured so many times on Food Network & Cooking Channel shows I finally got to experience it...TWICE in one weekend! :D

I wasn't planning on eating a \"dirty\" meal our first night we got to Vegas since I wanted to still look somewhat lean for the Olympia Expo (cuz everybody that attends that convention and show is just shredded to the max and I can't go in lookin' like a flabby chump) but I ended up fasting for over 22 hours and I needed a place to eat STAT! So I ended up here, at Bachi, alone since the SBBF had his own team dinner to attend.

I didn't have to wait long to be seated even during their busiest dinner hour (7-8pm). Once I was seated I knew exactly what I wanted for my appetizer to start, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries of course! I love the fact that the table of 6 seated right next to me ordered the same appetizer, but for their entire table. And I loved it even more when my fries came out and I literally devoured that ish like a BEAST and I could tell that party of 6 were either horrified watching, or completely entertained. As I was scarfing these fries down I could taste every bit of authentic flavor to this dish. OMFG! Seriously the best of the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! I love how crispy these fries were and the oxtail flavor was just orgasmic. The raw jalapenos mixed in with the garlic aioli was heavenly. And the final cherry on top to this dish, that fried egg...omg, as I broke into that egg and it seeped down through all the fries, I seriously was jizzing all up in my panties right then and there!

Now onto the burger! I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which came with the most delicious beef patty, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. The bun itself had the right crunch and chewiness to it. I enjoyed every bit of this burger. Thanks Kristi (my waitress) for the recommendation!

**The following night...around 11:30pm we returned to Bachi! Technically, I returned here and just brought the SBBF along.**

Appetizers: 
1) Truffle Parmesan Fries with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream slathered all over it with a sun dried tomato aioli as the dip. The fries were delish! That black truffle cream hit the spot for these fries. There's really no need to even dip into the aioli because I felt it took away from that black truffle flavor on the fries.
2) Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt and a yuzu citrus aioli for the dip. You can honestly never go wrong with sweet potato anything! These were bomb diggity, end of story.

Burger:
I went for the Kalbi Burger this time with angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made KIM CHEE and a ko chu jang mayo. I think because of the fact that I'm a kim chee whore, this burger totally topped the burger I had the night before. OMG! Flavor was just amazeballs! And the pickled cucumbers that came on a little side dish was heavenly! Mmmmmmmm baby!

I also ordered their hot Japanese matcha green tea both times I came here. You get free refills with their teas and it was delicious. 

Service is top notch here. They are very attentive and efficient. I'm definitely returning to Bachi the next time we're in Vegas. It's a f*ckin must I tell ya!"}
{"text":"First time visiting a Bachi Burger, overall a great first impression, wish they had the wings, but they had ran out the night before. My waiter Matthew was pleasant and attentive. I had the Mr. Mayagi Burger and truffle fries, yummy. I recommend the Guava and Coconut Tres Leche cake, it was perfect end to a great meal."}
{"text":"While I don't think this place lived up to all the hype, but was still pretty good. The chili fries were wonderful as were the fries that came with the burgers. The burgers themselves all seemed a bit on the sweet side. Sweet on top of sweet is not the best combo. Especially when it comes to a burger."}
{"text":"I guess since I'm the Duke of Bachi Burger (as of 9/11/2014) I should relinquish my duties as Duke, whatever those might be, to finally write a review of this place.   It took 60+ visits for me to come on here and officially proclaim: Bachi Burger is the best burger joint in town.

I read all of the 3 star and below reviews and I feel sad for those reviewers.  Not because they don't have good taste, but because they clearly haven't experienced the Bachi that I've come to know and love over the years since it opened.  I will say that even though I am blessing it with 5 stars, I've definitely had moments where I questioned that rating, be it from visits where I experienced awful service, undercooked burgers, or the terrible, terrible practice of their writing down my credit card info every time I make a take-out order.  All of those are forgiven though for me due to the 85% of the time when everything is flawless.

I've had almost everything on the menu.  My absolute favorite order is the Black and Green burger.  When they nail it, they absolutely nail it.   The Wagyu beef, bacon, blue cheese, spinach and mushrooms all form together like Voltron to make one of the best burgers I've ever had.  But there are 70 other reviews where you can read about that.   I also really like the Lonely Bird when I'm not feeling like red meat, which isn't too often.   Miyagi San, Banh-Mi, Ronin, all solid as well and belong in my rotation.   

One thing I rarely see mentioned or see people take advantage of is the build your own burger feature.  I've actually had several times just a straight up Bachi Burger with a Wagyu patty which comes standard with Lettuce, Tomato and Onion and anything else you want, but it doesn't even need anything else.  It's nice to know that they're not just putting lipstick on a pig, or in this case, a cow, and that the meat can stand on its own.  

I hinted earlier at undercooked burgers and I will say that in my experience Bachi tends to cook on the lower end of the spectrum.   Medium-Rare which is how I would normally like it has come out too rare for me and Medium often comes out the way I'd normally expect Medium-Rare.   So I stick with medium for the most part. 

For fries they do a decent sweet potato fry, and oddly enough I just don't get the hype over the oxtail chili cheese fries even though I've had them 5-6 times, once done over sweet potato fries which I think is a special order type thing.   Fries, oxtail meat, and egg sounds like my death row last meal, but each time I found them underwhelming and prefer to just go the Salt and Pepper Garlic french fry route.   The fries aren't at all what keeps me coming back here and I'd like to see them experiment more with different varieties, but it seems to be the same ones from the first day I went there and I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon.

Drink-wise they do a mean sake sangria which I find irresistible, although pricey and they have Rogue Hazelnut ale, so I'm normally happy either way.   

Service can be inconsistent, usually due to how it's ALWAYS BUSY, but there are several very solid individuals who work there at the moment and they treat the Duke with respect, as they should."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? A few years ago the line was out the door, taxis dropping tourists off, 1hr wait to get on. We went yesterday 5pm and it was a ghost town. Literally empty (see pics). Waited 7 mins at host stand before being seated. Another 10 mins before waiter acknowledged us. Food took forever to come out. Service was sooooo slow. Anytime we needed waiter we had to hunt him down. Only one waiter and one host and they both gave off the vibe that they hated their jobs.

Appetizers were good but burgers were disgusting. Everyone in my party said they were nasty and we all got really upset stomachs from them.

Place is also grungy inside; seats and tables rather damaged up.

They opened an Asian restaurant next door and it too was completely empty."}
{"text":"Such a great customer service! The hostess, Melinda, was very sweet and prompt. She made sure we were comfortable while we were waiting and even got us water. All of the cocktails offered here are well made and delicious! Thank you so much for such a great experience! :)"}
{"text":"The food was unique and delicious. The presentation of the food was great. The waitress was super friendly. We went in a group of five and ordered four different kinds of burgers. We passed them around so we could all try the different flavors. They were all so good!"}
{"text":"The hostess said there would be a 20-25 minute wait for a table of 7, but was seated much sooner which was nice. We were seating in another room which was practically empty. 

Our server was friendly and helpful. Once we got there, asked for 2 orders of the oxtail fries. When the first order came, we noticed the portions were big and asked if it was two orders on one plate. The tall blonde female server (not our server) responded with \"..maybe the second one isn't out yet..\" Uh, ok. 

There was enough staff, but oddly the service was slow. Like I mentioned before, it was not super packed. Food came slow. I understand that we were a bigger party, but we noticed the smaller tables around us hadn't received their food yet either. 

They split the check by guest, which was nice. We ended up paying with one card, but it still took forever to get our card back. 

Overall, the food was good, the atmosphere was nice. Ordered the Ronin burger. Everyone at our table ordered something different and enjoyed their burger. Staff was a killer for me. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Asian fusion style burgers and drinks. I liked tasting the new flavors, I thought it was innovative and interesting change to classic burgers.

The only con I could think of was my burger [the Ronin] and my friend's [Kiki] both tasted very sweet. It was good, but a tad too sweet. I think people who enjoy Bulgogi will like these Asian style burgers. The only reason why I mention this is the burgers here reminded me of bulgogi because of the sweet flavors marinated in the meat.  

I liked the squishy bun and how well it held all the ingredients together. Besides the dripping sauce, I loved how it did not fall apart and was easy to eat. 

My favorites: Tasted a sip of my friend's apple lychee soda, it was DELICIOUS!!!! I rarely drink soda but I really loved this drink it was so refreshing. I also really enjoyed the garlic truffle fries!!"}
{"text":"The food is here ALWAYS 5 stars.  The problem is the service.  Out of the 4 years I have patronized this place, I have ONLY received 5 star service ONCE.  Whether it's attitude from the person at the door, or the waitress.  It is NEVER consistent.  This place has so much business that they don't care who they turn away.  I have contacted them by Facebook in the past.  They tell you what you want to hear.  The next visit will be better.  Nope!  Once I was told we couldn't sit at the bar(where they had seats available because we weren't drinking, and it cuts into the bartenders' tips.)  I love their Waygu burger, and usually get a double, but NO food, no matter how good it may be cooked, is worth this much wait, or trouble.  I hope one of their cooks opens a place with halfway decent service, and knocks this company off their high horse.  Their version of customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  My service should match the prices charged....not even CLOSE!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten.  Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the wagyu beef burger.  Taste was absolutely amazing.  So juicy, I needed three napkins !!!!!"}
{"text":"My hub and I have had this place on our list for over a year, came once before but wait was ridiculous, so we went next door to Shoku Ramen and we loved it. Anyway, we came back tonight, place is packed, hostess guy said 35 minutes so we said cool, but can we just eat at the bar? No! We don't serve food there, and mind you it has about 12 seats and no one was sitting there. Well, ok , then we will have a drink there and wait. So we have to order a drink over this stupid glass wall, and who knows why, something about a sushi bar, blah blah blah, makes no sense, especially since we work with the health department on restaurants opening and have never ever heard of this dumb partition, anyway, what a total waste of space for a place this busy, they could have turned tables like crazy if they would just serve some dang food at this bar!?!?  So after about 2 drinks each and forty minutes later and no one leaving their tables, we pay our bar tab and are about to leave but the hostess man says, our table is ready! Ok what the hell, let's just stay and see what the hype is about.....waitress comes over and I say quickly he will have the black & blue burger, and I'll have Mr. Ho's, and the truffle fries. Food comes about 20 min later, and the truffle fries are ok, some brown goop on about 5 fries, no truffle flavor, and they look like McDonalds fries but not nearly as good...then we get our burgers. My burger was on a purple bun, and I thought it was blueberry so I ask the waitress, she says it's taro, ok so what's that, and she says some thing called taro, it grows out of the ground, mmm whatever. It is a good burger, interesting to say the least, cooked perfectly, hubby said his burger was great but he won't be back due to the wait. I say fix the bar issue which is valuable wasted space, and suggest people sit on the patio which we didn't even know was an option."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is always pretty tasty! I highly recommend for when you are craving quality food yet casual and fun.

Got there a bit earlier than my friend that I was meeting so I put my name in for a table and waited at the bar. It took a few minutes to order but they were really busy and the moment the bartender freed up he promptly acknowledged me and got my drink immediately. I ordered a cucumber mojito. Yum!!! It was really yummy and made with Japanese cucumbers. I have never had a Japanese pickle so I don't know if they are typically bitter but the ones in my drink were so I avoided them after my initial bite. Trust me... Didn't stop me from sucking down the delicious drink whatsoever!

My friend arrived and we were seated. I immediately ordered the pickles as I have had them before and absolutely adore them. Now this isn't your typical dill pickle by any means. It's actually a variety of pickled veggies including watermelon radish, green onion, garlic, etc. Huge problem with this appetizer is that it's so tasty that I didn't want to share! We also ordered the truffle fries which were also extremely tasty but they came with a dipping sauce that didn't really seem necessary since it didn't enhance the flavor.

For the main event I ordered the Kiki Burger which was delicious but the bacon didn't make as much of an appearance as I would have liked. But then again, I'm a bacon whore. My friend got the Black and Green and was really happy with it. Our server was friendly and attentive. She also came back to make sure my friend was happy since she pretty much likes her burgers raw. We will be coming back for sure but I'm not sharing the pickles next time."}
{"text":"If you like burgers that are boring, this isnt the place for you,  If you like some really cool, fun flavors go to bachi.  I love these burgers, the Spicy Miso, the banh mi (spelling?), the oxtail fries (cant believe I even tried them now I cant not order them),

Have eaten at both locations and except for occasional below average service, you can get a great burger, salad and fries."}
{"text":"Please note I  never post a yelp review, but this experience infuriated me. 

Pickled veggies were dropped off and usually the dish is explained, due to there being 6 different veggies and it wasn't  Pork buns were fantastic.  Juicy and delicious 
Brussels sprouts were undercooked and drenched in soy. 
We order the loco moko to share.  The risotto was cold and they took the dish back. Dish returned, risotto was wonderful, the burger was RARE and the eggs were heavily salt. Inedible. Management offered to buy me a beer or  dessert and I declined. Received the bill and NOTHING WAS TAKEN OFF. That is terrible customer service..:if you are going to offer to \"buy\" a guest something and they decline..:take something like the beer I ordered off my bill. 

Extremely disappointed in my experience."}
{"text":"Great service and amaaaazing burgers! The taste and combinations are spot on! 
I had the Ronin burger and I became it's master! Nom Nom nom!
My friends got the Kiki burger and loved it!

The meat is soooo tender and melts in your mouth, the perfectly toasted sweet buns and tasty aoli's are the perfect match for these fusion burgers!

Can't wait to come back, will defiantly be a stop before going back to LA anytime I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Good burgers, glad they are coming to LA (sawtelle area). Banh mi burger was the group favorite. The foie burger didnt really taste like anything."}
{"text":"Food: We ate the Pork Sliders, Ox Tail Chilli Cheese Fries with a fried egg, and Bahmi Burger. The food was good but the only amazing item was the Ox Tail Chilli Cheese Fries with a fried egg. Unfortunately service was one of the worst I've had. I asked for a coke to drink. Waitress said no coke only diet. My friend asked for a Sapporo. Waitress said no we're out. I noticed the guy at the table next to me asked a waiter for sugar for his coffee. The waiter said no we're out. Then replied I don't drink anything with sugar blah blah. Poor choice of words to say."}
{"text":"We placed an order for a variety of foods. 

We tried the ox tail fries. Nothing to brag with this plate.  Couldn't really find the meat and the fries weren't fresh fried. They were soggy and cold. Wouldn't order them again.

Sticky buns with pork. Meat was good. Size of the plate was small compared to the price. Side sauce was yummy. Not bad but not worth the price.

Fish burger. Extremely soggy bun due to sauce on fish. Fish was tasty and flaky but the soft bread made it impossible to enjoy as burger. I decided to eat the fish without the bread and couldn't enjoy the condiments it came with. Keep in mind none of the burgers include fries! You must order them separately.

Bachi burger with onion rings. Maybe the best thing we ordered except the meat fell apart. First bite made the past crumble and made it tough to eat. The overall taste was enjoyable but not fun to eat. Just messy.

Alcoholic beverage. They have a special blend of drinks unique to their theme. The puree was bland and did not have a fair portion of alcohol. It was obvious that the waitress didn't have bar experience.

Thai tea. Didn't meet the mark. I have this at least twice a week at home and it didn't even meet minimal taste. 

Service. She did get best to provide us with a great experience. That's why I'm giving it a 4 star and not 3! The genuine interest to get things done with a smile and a professional attitude made the dinner worth the stay. I can't blame the server for the food but I can blame the server for the great service! She really tried make it fun for us!

I recommend this place because overall I think there's a good concept and if they work on quality of food and their consistancy of flavors as much as they do on service they will be a hit place! 

I will give it some time before I go back but I will return for a second Chance!"}
{"text":"Come here every time I have to stop in Vegas! Hands down must try! Oxtail fries, pork belly bun... Y'all just gotta try this."}
{"text":"Family in town, wanted to try Bachi, so we loaded into the cars and headed their way, only to find, a line!  It's packed and of course, we gonna wait.  I smell the flavors floating our way while we wait and my mouth is watering like crazy.

Love the Kiki's burger, and as usual the burger is cooked perfect, the flavors so palatable and titillating, I wish I had two!  Love their sweet potato fries.   Good service, very good food, always a good choice for a burger."}
{"text":"Family in town and this is on their radar, we've been wanting to come back, so this is the right time.  We haven't been to this new location since they opened, but we're hoping it's as good as the original.

The place is very modern chic, concrete stained floors, flat screens on the wall, broadcasting both the TV Food network and The Food channel at the same time.  There are five of us and we get a tables pushed together.  Our server is at the table right away, we get our order in and knowing what's to come, my mouth is watering already.
 
I get the kiki burger, angus beef, sauteed mushrooms (shiitake, enoki, and eryngii), some caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade and aged gruyere cheese with garlic chili aioli.  It was sweet!  The burger was cooked to perfection, the flavors melting together as the first bite is taken, in a matter of minutes, the whole thing is gone and I cannot remember enjoying a better burger.

The family all enjoyed their burgers, it was worth the trip.  Now that they are a little closer to the house, might be visiting more often!  Good food, great service, and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week on my annual Vegas girls' weekend . The food was pretty good...burger was cooked just the way I like it, medium. 3 of the girls ordered the Ronnin Burger and 2 of the girls ordered the Kiki burger. So as you can tell, those two were probably the more popular ones. I had ordered the Ronnin burger as well, and it was really good. The burger had a fried egg in it...but what made it even better was the citrus aioli. They give that to you on the side, but seriously, that was one of the reasons why I liked this burger. The kiki burger had mushrooms in it and that was great too. But if I had to choose, I like the Ronnin burger more. 

They have Strawberry Guava Shake, but I wasn't brave enough to order that...too heavy for me I suppose. I still had to drive 4 hours home. However, I was able to order the Momo..peach and strawberry soda! that was so refreshing and yummy. Too bad it wasn't free refills, otherwise they would have heard from me for more. The fries were okay. We had the parmesan cheese one and the salt and pepper one. Everyone liked the salt and pepper one more. There was this gravy looking sauce on the parmesan fries...not so good. The sauces that came with it were not memorable, I didn't even dip them. The salt 'n' pepper fries reminded me of the asian dish salt 'n' pepper shrimp. No shrimp flavor but that salt 'n' pepper is definitely there! 
 
I wanted to try the spicy miso burger because I heard it was only there seasonal. But maybe next time. I will get that milkshake next time!"}
{"text":"When we got there, there was a line, it's a fast wait but once you sit down and order the food takes FOREVER. It's not that bad because they provide wifi and TV so you don't get bored.
If you go I suggest going with 3 or more people, because the fries is a must to order. (The portion is so big that if you share it between 2 people you'll be full by the time you finish it). Additionally, ALL of their burgers are SO unique that it'd be a waste to just try one. Sharing the burger by splitting it into portions is definitely more worth it. (I tried the spicy miso and Mr. Ho, i would recommend the spicy miso). 
Secondly I would order any type of drink because their drinks are very refreshing."}
{"text":"I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. I had the Kalbi burger which is prepared medium and was a good choice.  The parmesan fries were very good.  I would recommend the karage chicken as an appetizer, which is something I cannot find in most restaurants and the dipping sauce for the chicken is excellent.  As for the service, I thought it was good.  I have read some reviews where service was a concern.  This was not the case on my visit.  It was a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"Wish I could have enjoyed the food if they even took my order. We sat there for 15 minutes just waiting to get our drink orders. The waiters were too preoccupied with the table right next to me pulling out their cellphones and hugging and chatting instead of doing their actual job. Definitely won't come back just because of the service it's a shame I was pretty excited for the food."}
{"text":"The oxtail fries were excellent! Fresh jalapeño weaved in a textured crunch and perfect layer of heat. The fries were well seasoned and even with the topping, we enjoyed crispy ones all throughout. The chili was rich and tasty. We also had the Kiki's Burger. Loved the caramelized bacon and topped with a perfect amount of spring mix greens. The buns are fantastic- soft and the perfect size! I enjoyed a draft Stella Artois with our meal that was the perfect compliment. 2 of us split these items and it was the perfect amount to walk away satisfied but not too full."}
{"text":"Since I've moved to Vegas, I've heard a ton of hype around this place. I finally decided to go check it out and see for myself. 
The ramen bar was closed when we went, which was fine since I knew I wanted a burger. 

Their menu is pretty limited, which isn't a terrible thing but it made my choices of their signature burgers small. I ordered the Banh-Mi burger, truffle fries and a bottomless lemonade. 
The fries and the lemonade were amazing, however I wasn't impressed by the burger. 

If I return, I think I'll try their ramen instead."}
{"text":"I really love the food here but the service so inconsistent I never know what to expect. Sometimes they are spot on and other times they completely forget about you.
They won't seat you until your whole group arrives and with the parking situation here you could wait an extra 20 minutes after waiting for a table while your friends park. 
The waitress we had seemed to enjoy correcting our pronunciation as we ordered. It's a little showy and degrading. 
The food is quite good and unique but with all the other hassles my husband won't go there anymore. Oh well."}
{"text":"So the food here is worth 4.5 stars BUT the service here has in my experience been consistently bad. I live down the street and would love to be able to come here more often but every time I do I'm reminded why I tend to stay away...the most consistently slow and inattentive service. There was the one time that our fries came after we'd finished our burgers even after several requests for them. Or the time we watched everyone around us get served but were somehow forgotten. I understand these are not your typical burgers and fries but waiting almost 40 min to receive them just seems out of line. Now it's not necessarily bad servers, I think their kitchen contributes a lot to the slowness. If you do go and brave the service...every burger we've had here is delicious. My fave by far being the KiKi burger."}
{"text":"My friend saw Bachi Burger featured on the Food Channel, and so we ventured off the Strip to try it.  There were 10 of us, and the service was slow.  Our table was set-up, but somehow it took another 10 minutes to seat us.  It was 20 minutes from ordering to getting our food.  However, once we were finished, they were in a big hurry to clear our plates.

Food Review:
Ronin Burger - quality meat and tasty bun, overalll good flavor
Kalbi Burger - a burger with Korean flavorings, we found the kimchi to be too sweet 
Ox Tail Chili Fries - little ox tail, IMO, not worth $11
Vietnamese Coffee - watererd down, not really Vietnamense style
Sweet Potato Fries - crispy and tasty-- a hit at our table
Parmesian Truffle Fries - fries were tasty, although most in our group didn't care for the gravy
Caesar Salad- a little too cheesy for us

For $20/person including tip, it's pretty steep for what you get.  It was an interesting experience, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wait was about 30 min at around 1 PM.
Parking is spacious though. Bathroom is clean. 
Waiters(Waitresses) were sincere but not overly kind. They are there to just do business.

I have to say the food in general is on the sweet side. Don't really like that, but they seriously don't mess with food.

I got the shogun burger the most expensive burger: too sweet, foie gras was slightly undercooked (or is it supposed to be not sure), and the eel tasted fishy. I suggest eat it all there. Taking the leftovers makes the hamburger smell even more. No bueno. I would not get this the second time, but it was worth trying. My friends and I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, sweet potato fries, and kale salad. The sides were bomb!!! I have to say ya'll have to try all 3!!!

I would definitely love to come back for other items on the menu. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Second time here...2nd better than the first.  Wanted to give 4 stars but just couldn't.  Service was pretty good - food was ok...had the oxtail chili cheese fries, more chili than oxtail.  We both had Mr. Ho's burger but it was too sweet and our burgers were under done as we asked for Med-well which is slight pink but it was more medium.  Taro bun wasn't fresh it was almost crispy.  Nothing id rush back for but worth it to try if you never did."}
{"text":"We drove past Bachi Burger on the way to  visit friends in Vegas.  I thought the sign was cool and later our friends suggested we eat there.  They live down the street and eat there often.  They'd totally get a four+ stars if the service was better.

The decor was great and the menu looked very interesting - I love fusion cooking.  I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger - it was amazing!  Cooked perfectly, juicy and a great flavor combo.

The service was ok at best.  Our waiter spoke broken English and brought foods out in waves.  Finally, after we all had our burgers, the waiter asks what else we needed.  We're like, uh french fries.  By the time we got our fries, we were half way done with our burgers and the fries were cold."}
{"text":"i dunno about them burgers, but i definitely fuks w/ them Shoku Ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick, but tasty lunch before heading to our hotel to check-in, so a family member suggested this place that she saw on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives.
Sunday (7/1/12) they opened at 12:00 noon, so we arrived at 12:10pm -- they were packed with people waiting inside and out front!
Our party of 5 waited 50 minutes to be seated and at least 30 min for our food to arrive.  
We started with Pork Belly Buns $10 (good flavor and various ingredients) and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50 (hard, dry fries with barely any oxtail meat -- pricey & over-rated) 
The burgers (Miyagi-san $13, Ronin $10 and Kiki $10) were juicy and tasty, but not sure the Miyagi-san was worth the extra $3 for the wagyu meat b/c we couldn't taste a difference.  Parents loved the Bachi Fish $9.50 sandwich, so would try that if we go again. 
5 burgers/sandwiches, 2 starters and no drinks = $95.74 including tax & tip, so not a bargain, but certainly worth the experience.
Though the wait was long, our server was very nice and the management apologized for the long wait."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a staple in bringing flavor and culture in Las Vegas...

This was a to-go order that consisted of the Miyagi burger and the infamous oxtail chili fries...

Miyagi Burger: teriyaki glazed medium rare grass fed wagyu beef, chili mayo,  fried egg, furikake (seasoning you put on rice), bacon, and crispy onion strings...plenty of flavor in this burger...you have the sweet, salty, and savory...excellento

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: honestly I have 5 stars in this review when I really mean for it to be 4.5...The reason why are the fries...it probably has everything to do with me taking a to-go order however the fries weren't as dank as the other times I had them...since it was a to-go order they separated the chili in a different container from the fries, jalapeños, cheese, fried egg, and cilantro. ..The fries for some reason were dry and hard...The chili is great as usual...very sweet and savory...These fries definitely taste better if you have them at the location...I forgot to mention the order size seemed smaller than usual

All in all if you never been to Bachi Burger I recommend trying it at least once...I know fusion cuisine ain't for everybody but for the majority, it is.."}
{"text":"I had the veggie burger and the truffle sweet potato fries. The fries were crispy and warm. I loved that it also had cheese along with truffle sauce. The downside about this was that the sauce was only on the top so the bottom had no sauce. I recommend asking for the sauce on the side. It came with another sauce on the side but that overpowers the truffle so I don't recommend using it. As for the veggie burger, I loved that it came with a slice of tofu. The patty was breaking apart as I kept taking bites. There wasn't much flavor to it but it was better than my other experience of veggie burgers in Vegas. I enjoyed the bun a lot! 

The meat burgers looked better."}
{"text":"This is our third time going to Bachi Burger. This is our first time going to this location. This one actually serves breakfast which is awesome because I'm a breakfast person. 
Rei was an awesome server. Very knowledgeable, professional, and helped us better understand the menu and recommended what he thought was best. He explained how each Bachi Burger had its own theme. How this one has breakfast and the one off Windmill has ramen. Burgers are exceptional. Truffle fries on point. Breakfast bomb. Just go there and you will want to order everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I will make sure that I come here every time that I am in town.       Wow. Great good thanks vid!!!!"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger brings the perfect asian fusion burger. My favorite is the Ronin burger, which comes with caramelized onions, fried egg and Japanese cole slaw. Definitely recommend it! I've also tried a bit of the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Burger and the Spicy Miso burger which were both perfectly packed with flavor. The beef itself were also juicy and always cooked to perfection. 

The only burger I did not like was the Black & Green Burger. It sounds good on paper - spinach, blue cheese, bacon, and mushrooms - but I think the mushrooms overpowered the burger way too much and left me with a weird taste. I was pretty disappointed with it. 

The Oxtail Fries are a must! It's a great appetizer to share. The Sweet Potato fries are also really good as well and come with a delicious yuzu citrus aioli sauce. The Truffle Parmesan fries were good too but it has some sort of gravy (it's called black truffle porcini cream in the menu) that some of my friends didn't like. 

All in all, there's so many options to choose from and most of the time it will leave you with a happy tummy! Bachi Burger is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"OMG! Burgers were fantastic!!! Specifically the Kikis Burger and the Black & Green Burgee! Kiki's burger (Wagyu) had shiitake and enoki mushrooms spring baby greens and caramelized bacon. Black & Green (also Wagyu) had caramelized bacon spring baby greens and blue cheese. In a word, spectacular!!!
On the other hand, our waiter needed help!!! I'm talking more training! He didn't know the menu or the specials; didn't check to find out the answers to our questions. I worked restaurants for almost 10 years, refused to tip him more than 15%! 
The reason for 4 stars, not 5 stars?|Unhappy with the service, but the burgers were GREAT!!!
My suggestion, maybe try the other location."}
{"text":"With locations now in California, there's no doubt Bachi Burger's popularity isn't dying down. With a couple thousand reviews, there's not much to add except that I'm a fan of the Asian inspired burgers with the extensive beverage menu. I just go in knowing that I'm going to drop a couple extra bucks and there will most likely be a wait for a table. You'll usually also find a drop off in service with increased wait times due to the high volume of patronage. But you're sure to find a burger with great flavor and a beverage to pair with it.

My favorite is the Kiki's burger which is basically a cheeseburger revved up with bacon, mushrooms,  sweet onion marmalade, and a garlic aioli. I would also recommend the oxtail chili cheese fries if you've got somebody to share them in order you not be too full for your burger because you polished off a whole order of fries on your own.

On our last visit, I had the Shogun burger with a Sam Adams Rebel IPA. Although I appreciate the combination of foie gras, unagi, asian pear, and miso butter combination, the wagyu beef gets lost. The pear was actually the most overpowering. I did think the yamamomo peach was interesting as a palette cleanser. If you like a little more simplicity with your burgers, I would not recommend this burger with a price tag attached of $26.

Bachi Burger will always be on the radar when we're looking for a unique, quality burger."}
{"text":"After teaching class I had no better way to get my food fix than to find a burger joint! 

With burger joint so finding a place that had high quality meats and different varieties of their super important to be! 

My husband and I shared the ox tail chili fries and they were GONE in two seconds! Fresh French fries with their special sauce and among ox tail chili, light cheese, fresh jalapeños and a sunny side up egg?! YES MA'AM! 

I chose the Banh Mi burger and hubby got the miyagi-San burger! He loved his choice and I wanted to keep mine and picture frame it! The ingredients were fresh, the burger was perfectly medium and the nuk mam dipping sauce was sweet and savory! 

Sides don't come with the burgers but for their prices around $14 each they were large in portions and super satisfying! 

We didn't taste any beers on this visit but WILL BE back to sample some of their neighboring restaurants ramen and other menu selections including desert!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one on Windmill and it was packed so when I heard there was going to be one in Summerlin I was stoked.  The thing that sold me on this place was the fried egg.  Almost every burger I get now everywhere has to have a fried egg on top.  I feel like it just completes the meal.  It's a much larger location that the one in Henderson and it is right next to the movie theater so it makes a perfect dinner and date movie.  

Started off with oxtail chili cheese fries with the garlic chili aioli and fried egg.  Then the next thing was our rare burgers.  Very juicy, with a fried egg,  Kiki burger.  Quite honestly the best burger bun I've ever had.  My friend finished it off with a marshmallow shake with salty caramel sauce.  My server(s)- (shift change) - we're very informative."}
{"text":"-----SPICY MISO BURGER-----

-----OXTAIL CHILI FRIES-----

Did I make it clear enough? 

I came here again just a couple days ago and tried out a different burger. You can read my previous review to hear about my experience trying out 4 different burgers and 3 different fries. 

This was my first time ordering the spicy miso burger and it was absolutely delicious. It honestly puts the other burgers to shame as far as flavor goes. A spicy miso sauce that's placed on the patty and the whole thing is topped off with lettuce, onions, sauce, cheese and a fried egg! Seriously, miso and a fried egg? How can you go wrong with that? It was so delicious that from now on that is all that I'm going to order. 

Also another plus is that Bachi Burger is open so late. They were open until 2am and the last call for food is at 1:45am. Bachi Burger is a must if you are in the Las Vegas area no matter what! 

**They are also opening one up on West LA for all the socal people!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burgers. Mediocre ramen. Mediocre everything. You can tell most of the employees that work there aren't happy to be there and the chefs are always screaming from the window. This place has really gone down hill. The tables are all scuffed and the floor is always dirty. Maybe with a little effort and money management could get this place up to par."}
{"text":"I dined at Bachi Burger earlier today for lunch. This was my first time eating here, my friend said we should  try this place out. 

The restaurant itself is very contemporary, not your typical burger joint with stools near the kitchen or anything like that. It's Asian inspired with artwork, wooden floors and a clean yet simple set up. 

I ordered the Bachi Caeser and BBQ Bachi Burger. They have a menu with American-Asian fused cuisine. Very Hip and Different!

Customer Service was okay. When we walked in there were several people who said Hi and right away set us up a table. Later on , there was only one waitress for the entire floor. I'm guessing everybody else went on break? It took a minute to get a refill or ask for the check.

My only concern was the Salt and Pepper French Fries. My friend ordered them and as we were eating them, we noticed a WORM slithering about the fries! To our disgust, we politely asked the waitress to look at it to prove we weren't insane. She took the fries away and sent the General Manager our way. He was very polite, apologized and offered us dessert. I think that was the best way to handle a situation like that. 

Overall, my first experience there was okay. I'll definitely come back another day... but I'll make sure to check the fries for any visitors ;)"}
{"text":"Just go here and try one of their burgers, you will not be disappointed! 

We hit this on our way out of town based on my friend's recommendation and I am thankful we did. We shared a Kiki burger with an egg and truffle fries which were both bomb! Also ordered the pork belly slider which were damn good as well. 

As Samuel Jackson said, \"Mmmhmm this is a tasty burger\"

Can't wait for them to open up in LA!"}
{"text":"Super good service, And awesome food! Burgers are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The oxtail chili cheese fries is a must!!! LOVE! I came here late in the evening during the week so seating did not take long at all. I do remember coming to this place around lunch time a year ago and the wait is pretty long. Not sure if this has changed. Also ordered the spicy miso burger. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best burger place in las vegas hands down.I am local here in las vegas and whenever I am in the mood for a quality burger I stop by at Bachi burger. I love the Ronin burger and Garlic fries is  my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent, unique burgers. The Kiki burger was amazing. If you're looking for a great meal off the strip, this is the place."}
{"text":"Used to come here multiple times when they were still new. The food has remained still great as ever. But the service isn't as great as it was before. They weren't busy but our server took at least 10 minutes to take out drink order from the time we were first seated. Once we ordered our dishes and our drinks that took a while too. I had to remind him about our drink orders that consisted of a basic coke and two plantation sweet teas and the kona coffee shake.  A table that was seated about 10 minutes after us and was being served by the same server received their drinks before us and they ordered a mixed drink from the bar and our shake came after all our food was at the table. I was definitely disappointed by the service. Next time I have bachi burger cravings I'll just go to another location."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place last month after many trips to Vegas.  It was excellent.  My husband swears this is the first burger ever he has never had to put anything else on it, i.e,. ketchup, mayo, etc.  He loved it.  Since then he compares all other burger places with this one and none compares.  He had the Miyagi Burger.  Wanted to try to oxtail chili fries but decided to just savor the burgers first and expand on our tasting later.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The oxtail chili cheese fries were the best. I absolutely loved my dining experience at this establishment. Very feeling 7oz Angus Beef BBQ Bachi Burger. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place out this visit.  I'm bringing the wifey back next time!

Ordered: 

Ox-tail chili fries - Wow i love chili fries and this is just like adding heaven to an already great side!  Must have if you like things that are fatty!
Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Very refreshing and nice starter.
Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu - I'm done searching for the ideal burger as it has now arrived.  It's fancy, it's big, it's rich but the way each flavor is introduced bite after bite, chew after chew it's texturally perfect and juicy is an understatement.  

Some go to mecca, i'm coming here for my spiritual fix."}
{"text":"Wagyu beef is very good. Highly recommend. Jon said cherry shake with liquor and chunks of cherry was great. Loved the Kim Cher pickles had sesame flavor. Blue and green burger yummy.  Will come back not much of a wait if you go early-6ish."}
{"text":"It was a bit pricey, and the burgers weren't worth what they were charging for it. There was nothing about the burger that made it stand out, nor the fries that we ordered either."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Manager's an a-hole! I had a table of 15, and he said it  was to hard to merge their center tables to accommodate my family. So we ate separate with gaps between our tables. What a prick! I wanted to walk out, but a certain family member was dying to eat there. Never again!"}
{"text":"BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
What's my favorite word? BACHI!

Hell yah, this is that make you feel good cuz it tastes good food.  It's kinda like anybody's 21st birthday at a club.  Everything is appealing, fun, loud, and new because it's LEGAL, but after you finish your asian fusion burger, oxtail chili cheese fries, and drink...it's all downhill from there.  You get sleepy, getting that -itis, and you can't breath because you're wearing skinny jeans and all you wanna do is lay down wherever you are.  But the next day, you look back and wanna do it all over again.  Yes it's amazing!

I tried out that Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and immediately thanked the cow that sacrificed their efforts to complete my happiness.  Pure joy I tell you.  

But it was the Oxtail chili cheese fries that put me over the \"unbutton my jeans and unzip my zipper\" line.  I guess I was supposed to share it but you know when you get into the zone...things just kinda happen.  Yes, I finished em.  Sorry fam.  

So again...what's my favorite word?"}
{"text":"I am not sure if we just came at the \"right time\", BUT our service was great, food came out fast, and it was DELISH.  I had the the kalbi burger, my boyfriend had the bahn mi burger, & we split the garlic fries.  All three I would recommend."}
{"text":"Subpar burgers. Had higher expectations for these bad boys. I tried the Kiki burger (mushrooms) and Kalbi burger as well as their oxtail chili cheese fries. I can pass on the fries for sure. The burgers were a bit hard to eat given its height. Nothing memorable about this place. I do remember I enjoyed the Kalbi burger the most. I found everything a tad salty. I would suggest going to In-N-Out instead."}
{"text":"This is the place you want to go to if you want a fresh delicious burger. Every burgers they made it fresh and juicy.  My favorite is the Kim chi burger.  It's a must try."}
{"text":"The hype on Bachi Burger rose to new levels for me after my friend michael m's review of this place showed up as Review of the Day.  So I was expecting great things when we rolled in here yesterday.  

First of all, I was surprised that it was Asian-influenced burgers - I thought this was going to be a better version of Fatburger or something.  (Sorry Mike, I didn't actually read your review.)  Somewhat skeptical, I ordered the \"banh mi\" burger and the garlic salt/pepper fries.  I was not disappointed with how tasty it was.

You can read the multitude of other reviews created by more polished writers than myself to get a sense of the food.  Despite being in a typical Vegas strip mall, the decor makes for a \"hey this place is pretty cool\"-type meal with friends or maybe a casual date.  There are some nice stylistic touches like the silver cup used for the french fries and pint glasses that have a sold feed to them.  

Suffice to say, I'll be back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"OMG. PLEASE come here if you're in the area. their kimchi burger, sweet baby jesus, AMAZING. i love hamburgers and this place delivers. unfortunately i don't remember our servers name but she was extremely nice. we were told the wait was about 30 minutes but we waited less than that. this burger joint is a gem. the oxtail chili cheese fries are also delicious. they also have boba, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here on own way to a UYE, and ran into two other Yelpers who joined us- and we were all there for the first time!

I got the Meatless burger, with truffle fries and my boyfriend got the Turkey burger and sweet potato fries. We also got a bowl of garlic edamame with truffle oil to start- which wasn't very garlicy, or truffley, so it wasn't worth the extra dollar in my mind.

The Meatless burger was not the best I've ever had- but it sure as hell was the most invent! You get two types of veggie burgers: patties made of a mixture of veggies, or a 'patty' of a vegetable (mushroom, eggplant).This burger had a base patty of rice and beans and other veggies, but also had a thin slice of tofu and eggplant, both breaded and seasoned, which gave it a very different dynamic. The flavor was good, but mostly just sweet and sour tangs- I didn't taste much in the veggies or the tofu.

My boyfriend liked his Turkey burger, but wasn't impressed with his sweet potato fries. My truffle fries on the other hand were really good, and the sun dried tomato sauce they come with is ADDICTING! 

This place turned out to be cheaper than other gourmet burger places we have been to."}
{"text":"Best burger joint around! I highly recommend the crab cake burger... I always make sure to order me a taro boba drink as well, yum!! Excellent restaurant to take people visiting Vegas. Fun menu and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Well, I can't review the food because I didn't even get to order. We were sat quickly and then ignored for about 15 minutes, at which point we just got up and left. There were about 4 servers and it wasn't even busy - not one person stopped by to take drinks orders, say they would be right with us or anything. I tried getting the servers' attention multiple times, but I'm not going to beg for someone to take my order."}
{"text":"So I decided for once to do a review while we eat. Well where to start, well the AC is playing up, so its hot in here, the wait time was quoted at 10-15 minutes, it took 20 mins to seat us, close enough. The strange thing is, we asked for drinks while in the waiting area, the hostess did say that was a good idea, then went back to standing against the \"bar area\".

Okay, at this point, it is only fair for me to say i'm in the hospitality business and the way the whole AC playing up thing is being handled badly, for the review I will look by it, but as I'm sure the management will be reading this, a quick couple of pointers, serves some ice water to the people waiting, no cost to you but makes waiting in a sweat box nicer. Also, how about running to home depot and picking up a couple of floor fans to at least get the air moving ? 

Actually, just talked to the manager, it seems the AC will be working tomorrow and the owners do not want to spend the money on fans.

Just seated, serves is nice, cold drinks served very quickly, smart lady.

Anyways, on to what everyone wants to know, the food.

Yeah, it is that good, ok, its better than good, it is probably the second best burger I have eaten.

I had the kiki burger, minus the onion, great burger, the fries were the truffle oil ones, very nice as well.

Proof yet again that quality ingredients gives you quality food.

Desert time, only thing they have is the doughnuts , let's see...

Mmm yeah ok, not the best ever, a little on the tough side, the ice cream is refreshing though, if a little bland, throwing a coffee bean on generic vanilla ice cream doesn't cut it.

So all in all, a very good meal, in a less than optimal setting."}
{"text":"Cool, hip ambiance with nice servers and a great decor. Food was good. The burgers have great texture and strong sauces with a big meaty patty."}
{"text":"This burger joint remains rock-steady consistent with their high food quality and its presentations.  Dan is the man who knows how to make every visit like your first.  The food is number one.

The forethought of the seating hostess is truly suspect.  Why would you try to cram seven good sized adults in a corner table that is designed for six?  And we were among the first five parties that opened the restaurant.  Of course, we refused to accept such an amateurish and unprofessional choice."}
{"text":"Went here while in Vegas for the weekend. A friend told me about it and I also saw it on Diners drive inns and dives so we had to check it out. My girl ordered the oxtail fries and I ordered a burger. The burger was done perfectly, the way I like it well done. It was still juicy and the bun was great. The service was pretty good also. The only reason I didn't give a four star is the fries. They were the main reason we both wanted to come here. There was absolutely no oxtail on our fries. They came out with three plates, one for our table the other two for the guys at the table next to us. Offcourse I we both peaked over to see there plates and yes they had chunks of oxtails on their fries. Otherwise the taste was great but it left us yearning for more. #oxtails#wheretheyatthough."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Vegas around summer of last year, I've been hearing much hype about this particular joint. Does it live up to it? ehhhh kind of. My first visit there back in September of last year killed it for me. We ordered the parmensean garlic fries with tomato aeoli sauce as an app............waited over 35 mins......keep in mind this place was not busy at all...........still no fries....come on now, how long does it take to throw some fries in the fryer? Not only that but our waitress at the time didn't even issue us an apology or anything, she got me at the wrong time cause I was hellllllllla hungry after a hard session at the gym. Burgers were alright, just service couldv'e been better, minus 1 star.

Decided to give Bachi another try last night, went late night around 11pm with my gf again , WAY BETTER SERVICE!! looks like they have a new staff? Anyway, was greeted and sat down right away by our waitress Melissa, really nice gal. She catered to us right away and was prompt with our orders, I had the parmesean fries again....but got them within 10 mins! superb Melissa! Munched on those while we waited for the Duck Steam Bums....kind of like a chinese taco if you think about it....BOMB.COM!! Our burgers came right after...I got the Miyagi-San Grass fed wagyu burger....a little greasy but worth every gut busting calorie! HECK YEAH!!!! my gf had the....I forgot...it looked a little healthier than mine though lol. WHATEVER, GO BIG OR GO HOME! We were constantly checked up on by Melissa and even a fellow waiter, don't know his name but service meant everything, I know...I'm a supervisor at asian diner. 

Good job on the food and service Bachi Team! the only negative I have to say about the latest trip though, the fries were a little too crunchy/well done for my liking, but whatever, burgers made up for it!

P.S 

They have the Food Channel playing on their LCD Tv's :) And the music is lounge/Chill, perfect mix."}
{"text":"The seating arrangements could be better, you can get boxed in, but the burgers and shakes are awesome."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi, how I've longed to come visit you. 

After a long wait, my family and I gorged on a wide selection of their menu. 

We ordered the pickled vegetables, oxtail fries, Spicy Miso Burger, Kiki's Burger and Kalbi's burger.

Despite many raving reviews, I personally did not care for the Oxtail Fries. It was like chili over a bed of fries .. and the oxtail did not add much flavor, even the egg yolk (which was very minimal) did not wow me. I expected a lot more punch but it just tasted like chili over fries. If you didn't tell me there were oxtail in it, I wouldn't have known. For nearly $11, I was super disappointed. 

Out of all the burgers we tried, I LOVED the Spicy Miso Burger. It was so good, mouth-watering as I reminisce the burger. Delicious combination with the egg in it this time, and a wonderful flavor with the spiciness and miso-sauce. The burger was cooked to perfection at medium, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I would rank Spicy Miso, Kalbi (the Kim Chee was alright. nothing too spectacular since I've had much better Kim Chee but there was a lot of flavor in every bite) and then the Kiki's 

We randomly tried the pickled vegetables (see picture attached) and it wasn't anything special. It was good though, just very dainty. 

The reason for the 3 stars as opposed to 4 is because I've had a lot of these different wacky speciality burgers and I only thought the Spicy Miso burger was worth the price. The food didn't wow me to the point where I would necessarily come here again because there's just SO MUCH more places to visit in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food: The Oxtail fries were pretty good, not what I expected but very filling and tasty. I'm surprised the two of us finished it haha! The Kiki burger was also very tasty and they cooked it perfectly (med-rare). My boyfriend had the Miyagi burger with the fried onion rings, which we were told is their #1 seller. I thought it lacked some flavor but I really liked the crunchiness from the onions and the fried egg added a nice touch. Overall the burgers were ok...I guess we were expecting a little more? 

Service was good too.  Understandably there was a lunch rush so we weren't checked on regularly, but our server was very nice!"}
{"text":"I love a good burger. Now, throw in an Asian twist to that and you may have just found perfection (two of my favorites in one?!) I felt like I was destined for food like this.

This place luckily makes up what they lack in service (service was mediocre, if that) with their food. The burger quality is excellent and the Hawaiian bun they serve them on is a nice touch. I had Kiki's burger, which is an Angus burger, sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese and a sweet onion marmalade. I loved everything about this burger. It was juicy, tasty, and the flavors were very well balanced aka MOUTHGASM. I also had the truffle Parmesan fries. Yum yum yum!

I would definitely suggest trying a burger off of their \"specialty burger menu\", rather than building your own -- because you can do that at any burger joint.

I'm hoping when I decide to return that the service experience will be a little better, but I'm not really here to rate service, just food. There were other menu options I saw that would definitely warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"I love this burger place! I usually stick to the Ronin burger and I get my patty done medium rare. It comes with a fried egg and it's done over easy which is perfect. It is a bit pricey here but it won't disappoint you. A burger and a side of fries usually comes out to around $20 but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and enjoyed my meal. Only thing keeping it from five stars was the service and the value. It was expensive (at $11-$17 per burger, and burgers didn't come with any fries or your typical burger sides). 

I was eyeing the lamb burger which won the James Beard award but when the server was asked about it he said they were out of lamb. We asked if we could switch the patty out and he goes \"no it's all out.\" Ok... Thanks for your help...? 

Also the server didn't explain any of the condiments on the table. I hope this isn't the servers full time job bc he isn't doing himself any favors by being so sullen. 

I got the Kalbi burger (kimchee) and it was good. Probably a 1/3 lb patty with a lot of thickened soy sauce. It wasn't as spicy as I was hoping, but it was good. I ordered it medium but it came out medium rare :/. Also, it didn't seem like the value was worth it. My $11 burger (made with regular angus beef) was good but it didn't come with any fries, or your typical burger sides. My party had to order the fries (see below) as an additional side. Other people in my party got $17 burgers which were made with wagyu beef, so that price makes sense. 

The fries were extra but deliciously hot. 

The restaurant was pretty basic but clean. Had two tvs on the wall so I could catch glimpses of the March madness basketball games. 

Overall, four stars for the good food."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers places in town! Incredible food, great staff, and amazing menu. Not only is it just a great place to be, they also serve Ramen! So cool! So tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.. Horrible service.. I ordered a Thai Iced tea and never received it until I was almost done with my food.  Asked for the dessert menu and the waitress asked my cousin what he wanted without knowing it and he received his dessert and then I told the waitress what we wanted AFTER I seen that she had already took his order.. Then we wanted the bill to be split 4 ways and she said they can only split it 3 ways.  How does that make any sense?? O and they brought the fries waaaay before our burgers even came.. So we ate cold fries with our meals.. None the less we won't be coming back.."}
{"text":"In the early days of Bachi Burger....I honestly went here one too many times and got sick of the place, but I am so glad I went back this past weekend!  The menu is definitely expanded and refined compared to their early days.  Eatworthy items included the oxtail chili cheese fries.....think chili cheese fries dolled up with oxtail chunks, jalapenos, and then a sunny side egg on top.  It was a thing of beauty when it arrived at the table....I was almost reluctant to break the egg and mix it into the chili.  For those afraid of eating eggs slightly raw.....once the egg is broken, the hot chili cheese cooks the egg yolk into the chili cheese sauce...so don't worry ;)   We shared it amongst four and it was definitely just enough without over indulging.  Onto the burgers, they have many new burgers compared to when I frequented this place last.  The Miyagi-san grass fed beef burger I think was made with me in mind, since it included all my favorite ingredients: chili mayo, furikake, bacon, crispy onion rings, AND my favorite fried egg!  Other burgers, I've enjoyed in the past...but not as much as the Miyagi-san is the Kiki burger and for a little less beef action....the fish burger is quite tasty as well.  If we hadn't chose the oxtail fries...the truffle fries are a delicious alternative as well.  The service is just as slow as it was before....but I give the wait time to the fact that the burgers come out and look and taste of quality preparations.  And I still love the bun concept they have...instead of regular old buns...they have what is similar to the Chinese baked barbecue pork buns with a little sweet glaze...yum so soft and fluffy."}
{"text":"I love this location compared to the Windmill one!  There is more seating capacity and little to no wait most of the time.  The menu also seem to be more extensive with seasonal specials as well.  I've waited over an hour on the weekends at the Windmill site....which puts a downer on the eating experience.  Most of the burgers are $10-13 and I think a lot tastier than some pricier burgers you can get on the strip.  My all time favorite is the Miyagi-san burger with the wagyu beef, fried egg, onion rings, and furikake.  The flavor balance is perfect and the soft fluffy char siu bun completes the package.  I branched out this last visit and tried Mr. Ho's burger and I was pleasantly surprised by the taro bun which I like even more than the original bun they have.  However, I wasn't a big fan of the pork/beef combo and wish they had more lap cheong (Chinese sausage).  My favorite appetizer/side item is the oxtail chili fries that comes with a sunny side egg that you mix into the piping hot combination (big enough to share between 4 people).  I may forgo the Windmill site for the rest of my eating life now that I've discovered this location."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible, ramen is mediocre, the Kimchi they make is disgusting and overpriced, and the staff I encountered there was causing scenes infront of people. Really wish I never came here, wasted my time and money.

They have more room for improvement than any other place i've gone to, thats for sure."}
{"text":"Service was so slow last night.  The table next to us turned over three times while there.  Only ordered appetizers, burgers and cocktails.  The bartender had to come over to replenish mixed drinks so they could re use the glass, really you don't have enough glasses for a new one.  Plates sat on table after appetizers for awhile, had to stack them so they would get the hint!  Burgers were good, fries and appetizers were good.  Food good, Service was marginal at best.  If service was good might go back however, will wait awhile hopefully staff will turn over!"}
{"text":"Went here on my last Vegas trip. I had The Miyagi-san burger which was very delicious. Also tried the Truffle Parmesan Fries they were soooo good. Definitely coming back to this place on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last review... since mid-2011 apparently, but after eating at this place this past weekend I just HAD to give this place a review.  YES, THIS PLACE IS THAT GOOD!!!

I went to visit a friend who's working in Vegas, and decided to hit this place up since I was craving a good burger.  I was debating between this place and Gordon Ramsey Burgr (mainly since I'm a fan of Ramsey... how can you not be?)

After studying up both yelp reviews for Bachi and Ramsey... I decided on Bachi.  I HAVE NO REGRETS!!  Although, to be honest, I did also end up going to Ramsey a few days later... Ramsey was nothing special, and definitely paled in comparison to Bachi.  But this is a review for Bachi, not Ramsey, so my apologies, I digress.  BACK TO BACHI!!

My friend and I went there Friday night, shortly after I arrived in Vegas.  I would say we got to Bachi close to around 745pm.  It's located in a medium-sized shopping plaza off the strip of Vegas.  Nothing about this plaza screams out that they are hiding the treasure trove that is Bachi.

There was already a good amount of ppl waiting outside Bachi at the time we got there;  when we asked to put our names on the wait-list, we were told that there would be a wait of around 30 minutes.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty big, they have a quite a few tables and lots of TVs hanging around... very modern and trendy.  They also have a bar area that was pretty empty, my friend and I just decided to sit at the bar.  I was hungry from my drive, and I wanted to eat!

After perusing the menu, I decided to go for the MIYAGI BURGER, along with an order of TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES.  My friend wanted to eat a little lighter so he ordered the Sausage appetizers and a Salad.... whatever, he's weird.

The restaurant was busy, so my food did take a while to come out... I think it was around 30 minutes or so until I got my food, but ohhhhh boy was it worth the wait!!

The Miyagi Burger was just gorgeous... everything was stacked neatly onto each other.  It looks like one of those burgers that you would see on a TV commercial.

When I took my first bite, I felt like I was in heaven.  The bun was nice and fluffy, and the wagyu patty was oh so juicy and oh so perfectly cooked.  Yes, I am a huge fan of bacon (what guy isn't?), but for some reason... I am not a fan of bacon in my burger.  Not the case here!  All the ingredients here, especially the caramelized bacon and the fried egg, worked so well with the burger.  Nothing was overpowering... everything just served as a perfect complement to accentuate the wonderful taste of the Miyagi burger as a whole.

The burger was a good-size, but I managed to finish the entire thing in about 5 minutes... maybe even less!  The only time I stopped was so I could take a few breathes, and tell my friend how delicious the burger was.  By the time I finished the burger, my plate was a mess from all the juices that had seeped out... but none of the juices got onto my clothes, so no biggie.

The truffle fries were really good too.  Not too oily, not too salty, the dipping sauces were good, although I didn't find them necessary.  What distinguished these truffle fries from other truffle fries I had was the brown sauce that was layered on. I'm not sure exactly what the brown sauce was... I thought it was gravy, but gravy isn't listed as one of the ingredients on the menu, so maybe it was the black truffle porcini cream...?  Either way, the brown sauce was soooooo good, I just wish the fries came with more of that brown sauce.

The place isn't cheap... ended up paying around $20 for just the burger and fries, but well worth it.  I can honestly say that the Miyagi burger was the best I've ever had, and the truffle fries are definitely no joke.

Definitely coming back to try their other items!!!  BACHI BURGER ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"Always awesome! One of the best burgers in town (or anywhere for that matter!). Don't come here looking for a cheeseburger-these burgers are unlike anything else. The flavors are incredible."}
{"text":"Whenever I go somewhere new, I look up DDD's in the area to try.  Bachi Burger came up, and even though I don't remember seeing them on the show, I wanted to try it.  

It's a little confusing because there are more than one locations in the area. I went to this one, which I think(?) is the one that was on the show.  The location is in a nondescript strip mall.   I got the pork belly steamed bun appetizer and the bahn-mi burger.  The port belly buns were good.  Pro tip: be careful if you bite in to the bun, the strip of fat at the back of the pork will all come out as one chunk that you can't bite through.  Consider cutting it with a knife or eating the whole thing in one big bite.  It comes with a hoisin type sauce which is quite good. 

When I ordered the bahn mi burger, the waiter asked me if Medium was OK.  I asked for medium-rare at which point he warned me that the burger contains pork and shrimp, but they will make it medium rare if you want, so I did.
The burger was very good.  Portions appear small here but are quite filling.  It comes with fries which are also very good.

Nothing knocked my socks off, hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.  I think this place has the potential to be 5-star (perhaps I caught them on an off-day).  I would come back and try more entrees in the future if I come back to the Las Vegas area.

My waiter was young but was on the ball and on top of things.  The waitstaff refilled my drinks competently.  There is a parking lot in the strip mall so no issues with parking.

Pro tip: if you see Bachi from the road, you will be tempted to park on the wrong site.  The entrance is on the inner-side of the parking lot.  I parked and walked in but was on the wrong side of the restaurant and had to walk through it to get to the greeter station."}
{"text":"The Shogun burger is the best thing I've ever ate!! I love Foie grais and eel, its a perfect combination.  I would love to try the other burgers on the menu but I can't help it, I must get the Shogun everytime."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying this place, however the service was so awful that we never even got seated. We waited to be seated for about ten minutes and there were several empty tables. I made eye contact with several different employees and hostesses, yet were ignored by all of them. After ten minutes of standing there without being acknowledged, we gave up and went to Archi's Thai a few doors down. And what do you know? We were seated right away and had a great meal! Oh well, Bachi Burger lost our business."}
{"text":"Hmm.... I thought this place was trying to be a Unami burger place.   I just wasn't feeling it.   Burger was definitely above average for food in Las Vegas not the best I've had of the new fusion-type burgers."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Saw this place on Diners Drive-Ins & Dives and I knew I had to hit it up when I was in Vegas. Started with Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. They were absolutely incredible. The meat was super tender and slightly more sweet than beef. Cooked perfectly. I had the Spicy Miso Burger for main course, cooked medium rare. It is the best burger I've ever had at a restaurant. Cooked nice and juicy and seasoning was just on point. They also had a very cool beer selection of a lot of imported japanese ones you can't find anywhere else. It sells itself as a asian-fusion burger spot and it does not disappoint. 

Remembering the food makes me want to jump in my car and go right now for a burger. Hands down the place to go for a burger. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Came to BB on a couple of friends' recommendations. Unfortunately, their burgers failed to make it in my top ten. They weren't bad... they just weren't as good as other gourmet burgers I've had.

I ordered the Miyagi-san Burger (medium-rare) w/ Parmesan Truffle Fries. My wife got the Ronin Burger (medium) with regular fries. They arrived at our table about half an hour later, and we immediately noticed her burger was bloodier than mine. This was not a good start for my wife. We would have asked to cook it more, but we were already running short on time, so we split our burgers (which we were going to do anyway) since mine was less bloody.

I thought the Miyagi-san was good... I definitely enjoyed it more than the Ronin, which wasn't as flavorful IMO. I liked the crunchy texture from the onion rings, but overall, I was a bit underwhelmed. I think there was just too much going on. The more burgers I eat, the more I appreciate the simplicities of them. And as bloody as both patties were, I found them to be a bit dry. The sauces on the burgers added the juiciness to them, not the patties.

The Ronin didn't have as much going on as the Miyagi-san, but it wasn't any better as a whole. The caramelized onions were good, but that was about it. The slaw was barely noticeable, and the sauce didn't make a big impact for me. And the buns on both burgers barely managed to hold up.

The Parmesan Truffle Fries were mediocre at best. I thought the truffle part meant they would just be fried w/ truffle oil or that the fries would be topped with truffle shavings, but they basically dumped this truffle-ish sauce over the fries that was very overwhelming. It felt like I was dipping the fries in a mushroom soup. I did not enjoy this. The only saving grace was the sun-dried tomato dipping sauce on the side.

Service was great and the restaurant was clean, but when it comes to the food, I'd say Bachi is just A-OK. I may return one more time to try the Kalbi Burger and Oxtail Fries, but if I'm not impressed with those, I'm scratching this place off my list."}
{"text":"Truffle fries were excellent.  You can pass on the duck and pork belly buns.  The iced tea was terrible, boba was not good.  Miagi burger was really good.  Cooked perfectly, juicy and tangy.  It was a little oily though but still good."}
{"text":"WOW! first timer and will definitely be back! we had a Bachi Loco Moco and a Short Rib Benedict. Our server Jazmine was so helpful in making our decision, because we wanted to try everything!  I definitely recommend Bachi!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the oxtail fries, robin burger, and spicy wings. Food was fast & service was great. Can't wait to return back for more!"}
{"text":"the crab cake sandwhich was yummy and the oxtail fries-which consist of chili, fries, and a fried egg. yumm!!! its all gourmet burgers.. so if you like burgers and want to try something different this is a place to be, and they have a great list of nonalcoholic beverages as well, and its open late"}
{"text":"Very good burger. Fresh and juicy meat. Service a little slow but not that bad. Love the appetizer the bun with pork is so good. Lot of choices to select Love it. My friend had the ramen noodles and he love it too. Will come back to try something more."}
{"text":"My husband and I have heard great things about this restaurant and with receiving a gift card for Christmas it was the universe telling us we had to go. 

We asked the waitress what to get and she recommended the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer. These were delicious and could be a meal by itself! We each order a burger as well: Ronin Burger and Black and Green Burger. We barely had room to finish it all. We will definitely be back to try it again!"}
{"text":"I've probably eaten at this location three times but this is my first time reviewing it.  I remember seeing this place on \"Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" and had to put it on my must do list in Las Vegas.  This trip I met friends who live in Las Vegas at this place for lunch and it didn't disappoint!  I chose the Ronin burger just based off the description: angus beef, cole slaw, carmelized onions, miso goma sauce, fried egg and katsu bbq sauce.  Making me hungry thinking about it again.  The burgers are big, so big that when it is served, there is a knife down the center to hold everything in place.  The flavors of the Ronin go well together and is one of their top sellers.  

We ordered an appitizer plate of oxtail chili fries and these are uncomparable to anything else I've had on french fries.   Very tasty and messy!  The order was large enough to share with all four of us along with our burgers.  

The staff that served us was very friendly and accomadating. The kept it up even as the restaurant began to fill up and get busy.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at every other Bachi Burger in Las Vegas except this one.  It is probably the best decorated of the three branches.  I ordered the Ronin burger and others in my party ordered the Ban Mi burger, the Kal bi burger, the lonely bird and the pork steamed buns.  These burgers are  juicy, flavorful and big!!   The orders came out within 10 minutes after we ordered and we had also ordered the famous oxtail chili fries! Which are out of this world!

While there are non-burger items on the menu, I would recommend you stick to ordering what they are famous more, which is a damn good hamburger.  

   It has gotten to be our must stop on our annual pilgrimages from Hawaii to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Warning this place gets packed! We got there when it opend and there was a stampede of people, i figured it would peter out but by the time we left the line was out the door and down the hall!! Damn this better be good. It is. The food is different, the flavors are hard to describe but good lord are they good. If you want mickey Ds or in and out go there if you want something delicous (yes a bit more pricey) then this is the place. Service is superb, the food magnificent and well worth the trip out of the way from the strip and the ordinary junk. How can i put it burgers with a twist."}
{"text":"I ordered some food to go... Had the salt garlic fries which could have use more salt though the aioli sauce did help.  Ordered some of the pork belly buns, came with a spicy hoisin sauce - okay.  It took forever to get our order too, if I hadn't gone back and checked on my order, I probably would have been waiting even longer. Service for to go orders is horrible. Even one of my bun's inner contents fell out when u opened the box... Maybe there more careful for dine ins, I hope."}
{"text":"I've only been to their Sahara location so I was excited to check this one out. It has a smaller interior comparatively but very clean, simple and well-furnished. We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger, the Ronin burger and the salt n pepper garlic fries. I wanted to try the Mr. Ho's for its taro buns and sausages. It ended up being pretty good, and definitely very filling. The fries were great as well, but probably needed more salt/pepper/garlic because they tasted very much just like regular fries. I like the creativity and variety of burgers they have here, but honestly, for the price of a burger (which is a bit high), this wouldn't be my go-to burger joint. But the quality is good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ill keep it short and simple!


Food = AMAZING.

-I am not the easiest to please, but paying upwards of $20 a burger is not on my usual budget for dinner. So, for the price, I was very pleased!

Service = GOOD

Could be a little better. Though they were renovating at the time of our visit so I wont ding them

Atmosphere = OK/GOOD

A little bland for the price. But Id rather pay for the food and not the art on the walls!


I will deff recommend this place and keep going back. Great good!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian's nightmare! They have only one item on the menu that is suitable for vegetarians/vegans. 
I was forced to eat here as some of my friends love to dine here. The restaurant has a cool vibe and is very stylish. The food is very unique and high quality. But I wish they would add more sustainable dishes to the menu so that I could come back with my friends. It's 2016 for heaven's sake - and we all have vegan as well as carnivore friends/ relatives who like to go out for dinner together."}
{"text":"The Fam bam and I were in town for a few days and I was craving a burger. Found this grubbery on Yelp and decided to try it! Kinda of a random little joint in a shopping mall with not much signage. Once inside you kinda look around asking yourself what type of food is served here......well being Asian I knew right away this was a Asian inspired Collab kinda place. Sat down and than we waited.....and waited.....and waited. Took an easy 10 mins to take our drink order. Eeeekkk! She finally arrived and we had our Fingers crossed the food made up for things! Ordered the Chilli Cheese fries to start and four different burgers. I got the Spicy Burger and it was bomb diggity!!! The food totally saved the day!!! We left full and happy and will be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers and parmesan fries are amazing !! Great service , clean place and great food !!"}
{"text":"I'm a chicken when it comes to Asian Fusion but I'll try anything once, Bachi Burger I'll try twice.

I ended up here because my stand-in date for the evening, Kevin P. suggested it after seeing a show downtown. When we were seated, we were spotted by 2 of our Yelp buddies and ended up joining them for dinner. This was the first time any of the four of us had been here before, so we were a quad of Bachi virgins. Our friends had already ordered so we hurried and got our order in too.

My first Asian Fusion Burger... a little scary for me, so I opted for the BBQ Bachi Burger with bacon, not really Asian now is it? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#CMhdPUkwikeURGRpixQYOw My burger was good, not too sausy  which I appreciated, but decent flavor. Their bun was soft and a little sweet. Kevin went all out and ordered the Shogun burger, he has more balls than I do. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#JrpSQPuPkCuqcSXkLeE93A For me, if I spend $25 on a burger I better be raving about it! He seemed to enjoy it but definitively wasn't raving... he also ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (he's a big spender - $11.50 just  for french fries) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#cOTkdWIsTkh4Gu4mLgsLZg. These scared me too because they came with a fried egg piled right on top.. am I the only person who thinks this is odd? But I was so glad he ordered them because they were delicious, the jalapenos were were a fun taste explosion with the egg! I'd come back just for these fries!

Our server was top notch, she was friendly and joked around with us. She was patient with our meal requests and checked back on us frequently, she was 5 star all the way.

Our fellow Yelpers ordered the No Meat Here \"Burger\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#VLK240RnTcPEkeIX2MOAoA and The Lonely Bird. No one seemed to complain about their burgers, but no one was really bowled over. They tried the Garlic Edamame and thought it needed more garlic, they didn't care for their sweet potato fries, but they did enjoy their truffle fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#4pQmh02OeugST4oQtepO2w - good to know.We all seemed to enjoy our meal and conversation. I don't think any of us would mind eating here again, but I also don't know that we'll be rushing to come back."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this place as it has so many good reviews. It took 10-15 to get seated which I didn't mind waiting. 

Our server informs us that they're out of mushrooms which is supposed to come with one of the burgers I wanted. I ordered the black and green burger which was actually amazing and is the reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars. 

We also ordered the parm truffle cheese fries which came out bland and didn't have any flavor. Along with that we ordered the oxtail fries and thought the flavors didn't mix well. 

Also our food came out in 45 mins which really felt like 2 hours since it was slow and we were starving. The server explained to us that they had new cooks in the back and that's why it took so long.........

Overall, I really loved my burger but the service and timeliness of food needs to improve."}
{"text":"AWESOME find.  One of those,  how did we get there? Im so glad we found this place, kind of experiences for my group of 4.

Service was great- our waiter was funny, attentive and CRAZY fast.  We shared a few plates including the shishito peppers, octopus balls (not the best but not bad), onion rings ( AMAZING, we should have ordered 4 orders instead of 1) and we each got a noodle bowl or a burger for our mains.

Broth was delish of my noodles and the noodles were good, but the chewier ramen from the dish with the XO sauce had better texture.  Pork belly pieces were like bits of porky heaven- honestly it was very memorable and delicious.

Cannot stress enough how good the onion rings were.  As a bit of a onion ring connoisseur I have to say they rank at the top of my lifetime list, and they were incredible inexpensive.

MUST GO BACK!  You need to go and try this place out, now :)"}
{"text":"Met up with a couple of friends that live nearby here and had a great dinner.  Started with 3 orders of fries for the appetizer (not my idea but hey..sure!).  All of them were tasty and went well with Asahi..garlic salt and pepper, truffle parmesan and sweet potato fries.  

On a sidenote...has any restaurant truly found a good dipping sauce for sweet potato fries??  I haven't had one although I was thinking something on the sweeter side might be better.  Maybe honey and cinnamon or something.  And another thing...I just read up on truffle oil..it's all just chemicals isn't it?  

I got the Kiki burger w/ egg and it was awesome.  Burgers are always better with egg..that's a fact!!  The bun had a real chinese bread...nikumanish quality to it which I loved and it just made it THAT much better.  Got to try the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers too.  The kimchi was interesting on the Kalbi burger..not the traditional tasting type but really went well with everything else that was going on in between those 2 pieces of bread. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bachi = short for Hibachi = Grill

My friends kept raving about this place and telling me to try it, so I went here on my recent trip to Vegas. I got here late in the afternoon at around 3 PM, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I think that's pretty good considering the other reviews I've read. 

We ordered the truffle parmesan fries, Wagyu burger, and the Kiki burger. The truffle parmesan fries were ok. I'm not too sure I liked the truffle sauce that much. It tasted very similar to Asian cafe mushroom sauce to me, but a little saltier and tangier. I think I would have enjoyed the fries more if it had just parmesan on it. 

While we were waiting for our burgers, I noticed the staff was in disarray. I saw way too many employees in the restaurant, and all of them were running around looking frazzled. The guests sitting at the table next to me were unhappy and complained about their burgers taking a long time. Our waiter later explained to us that they were having a problem with the computer system. I'm guessing some of the orders did not get put into the system, which caused the delay. Despite that, it seemed like a bad day for the staff. Our waiter did not even ask my husband how he wanted his burger cooked. When my husband told the waiter later that he did not get to tell him how he wanted the burger cooked, the waiter said he thought he said medium. Actually, I was the one who said medium. My husband always prefers his meats rare, so it's not possible for him to say medium. 

Anyway, when the burgers came out, they looked just like they look in the pictures: juicy and delicious. I was quite pleased with my Kiki burger, although I found it just a tad sweet. I enjoyed all the flavors mixed in together with the shiitake mushrooms, juicy Angus burger, the veggies, and the soft bread. I had a bite of the Wagyu burger and immediately fell in love with the Wagyu. I think I might have liked the Wagyu more than my Angus burger! 

I can see why people wait for this restaurant. It's one of the better burgers I've tasted, but the way that the restaurant was being run could have been a lot smoother, especially with all those employees. I'd like to come back to Bachi, but I hope that the restaurant will operate much more fluidly when I return. It would be good if they could expand outside of Vegas and open it in Los Angeles. I bet it would be a hit!

UPDATE: They're opening one on Sawtelle!"}
{"text":"It's getting 3 stars because the burgers really are delicious. You can smell them from the movie theater. 

That being said the service here is absolutely horrible. They will often make you wait for tables when there are plenty open. They are remarkably slow. And they screw up my to go order almost every time.

It sucks because the burgers really are that good. This review went from 1 star to 3 because of them."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times. The ramen is always excellent, but the service sucks. I've had the same server about 3 times and she is always SO rude! Today we got the attitude and we were rushed out. I understand when there is a wait you need to turn the tables. But be nice about it!! I won't be coming back to Bachi burger."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. They have no host or hostess so the staff has to take time from serving to seat customers. We waited 45 minutes to be seated all the while looking at the empty table we were finally seated at when my husband grabbed a server and asked to be seated. The service was down hill from there, we had no utensils when they brought our appetizer, we had to wait another 10 minutes to get them. Burger was just ok and the charged for refills of the sweet tea. We will not go back."}
{"text":"The wait here is ALWAYS long, but the food is entirely worth it. This restaurant has the best burgers I have ever eaten in my entire life. I frequent this restaurant when I am visiting Las Vegas, and every time I have brought someone to this restaurant, they absolutely LOVED it.

Burgers: 
Ronin - not a fan of the coleslaw on it
Banh-Mi and Kalbi are my favorites. 
I need to try the Wagyu burger but it is 24 dollars! 
Miso Spicy - my best friend gets this burger every time and loves it

Fries - 
Sweet Potatoe Fries - amazingly crunchy on the outside and sweet and delectable on the inside
Truffle Fries - I don't like the truffe oil and they are not as crunchy as I would like 

Edamame -
GARLIC TRUFFLE OIL - most delicious edamame I have ever eaten, have tried to recreate this at home and failed. 
Ginger - this one is good, but I like the garlic better 

Sodas - Try the Apple Lychee or the Mandarin Orange soda. They are so good, I wish they had refills though.

If you are visiting vegas, this spot is better than any buffet or restaurant you would have at the strip. Don't waste your money. Come here and you will be full and happy and ready to win all your money back at the casino."}
{"text":"While my meal was pretty yummy, part of me tells me to give this an average rating because I've had many-a-burger in my life. Namely, Umami Burger and Gott's Roadside, just to mention a couple. I am from San Francisco and currently live in LA so I've had my fair share of gourmet burgers. Bachi Burger is good, no doubt, but it just didn't have that \"oomph\" I was looking for. Maybe it was the burger I had and I wasn't really feeling it (The Ronin Burger). The Truffle Parmesan Fries weren't even that good compared to other places I've them. I didn't get a chance to try other burgers or the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I wish I had gotten a different burger because the Asian cole-slaw-like veggies in my Ronin Burger were not good. The patty wasn't even that succulent.

I think that this place is only popular because it's somewhat near the Vegas strip and tourists from around the world hear about it. Honestly, if you've had your share of American burgers from gourmet-est of gourmet, this place is just alright.

Service is great, the restaurant is spacious, and they seem efficient about seating people. Would I come back again? Maybe, but probably to another location and definitely not getting the Ronin Burger again.

Oh, also minus points for not having a fully functional website so that I can review what I ate."}
{"text":"Warning! service  sometimes dips and you have to  flag down your server, forgotten items,  too much time for apps.... FOOD IS GREAT !!! still tho..... 
I had to write an email to owner on one occasion and he seemed genuinely concerned.. still go back for food with \"meh\" expectations for service.
Update .. Ate there a few more times and they stepped up their service tremendously!


REPEAT FOOD IS GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Favorite burger place in the Summerlin area, hands down. Only downside is how they handle seating customers. A little unorganized. There's hardly ever someone standing at the podium. 
Once you sit down, everything is wonderful. The burgers are so juicy and are packed with unique flavor. You get what you pay for, so it will be more expensive than your typical burger joint. Service is occasionally slow (4 stars), but food is delicious. The fries and dipping sauce are GREAT."}
{"text":"Ok so Bachi Burger is the way I would want my very own joint. The food is excellent they got a great vibe and their food is excellent if i didnt say that. 

Pork Belly Steamed Buns

Out of control good. I'm pretty snobby when it comes down to pork belly n this is cooked/cut to perfection

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries

One of my favorite meats. Any time it's on the menu you almost have to order it. This place does a great combination of all the flavors in the dish. Oh n baby jesus they put an egg on it. (of course they do)

Banh-Mi-Burger

I was pretty much sold before i got to this burger but man their presentation and flavor profile they put in is amazing. Good Angus beef and all the sauces do it justice. 

A must go if your within a tank of gas!!"}
{"text":"Great food but service is terrible- SLOW. The night we went it was a full house but it looked like there were only a couple of servers. The only saving grace for this place is the food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I have had very few burgers as good as this. The place is clean and nice. My only complaint was the service I recieved was just OK. The waitress seemed to be moody and pre occupied. We had to wait too long for water refills and she did not check on us very much. I did not ding for that only because everyone has bad days and I understand."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying DONT WAIT get your butt in here and eat this amazing food!! 
I work around the corner and can't believe it's taken me this long to come in. 
Zach was our server and gave great help in picking what to order. He did not disappoint and neither did their chef. Our burgers came out medium (perfectly pink) and juicy. 

I don't eat bread often but these buns are to die for... 

Truly the best cooked, full of flavor burger I've had in a long a$$ time. 

We also ordered the oxtail chili fries to start. YUMMY 

100% customer satisfaction. Thank u"}
{"text":"Triple D definitely found a winner here.  Bookmarked this place after seeing it on TV and am so glad that I did.  I would never have thought to order their infamous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, however they were so delicious.  The plate was literally scraped clean.  

Also their No Meat Here ... \"Burger\" was one of the very best vegetarian burgers I have ever had.  And I've eaten A LOT of veggie burgers.  Everything from the eggplant to the tofu to the mushroom patty was on point.  A really great combination of flavors.  I would definitely come back here, just to order this particular burger again.  In fact I can't wait to take my vegetarian sister here.  That's how good it is."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty slow. We ordered the ox tail fries and i'll give it to you! i am not a chilli cheese fries person, but this fries was OFF THE HOOK! on the other side, the burger to me was just so so. the taste was good, but i don't think this will be my \"go to spot\""}
{"text":"So, recently I got a message from someone that works at Bachi Burger, I don't know if it was the owner, but they agreed with me that the restaurant was indeed too stinky from the egg smell, and actually hired repairmen to fix the problem and encouraged me to come and try them out again.

After I told my husband to \"suck it, I told you so,\" about the egg smell we decided to come and try Bachi Burger for dinner.  They were right, there was a huge improvement on the smell.  When it comes to eggs, my nose is like a shark.  I can smell eggs like they can smell blood from miles away.  While the smell wasn't 100% gone, it was at an acceptable level that didn't bowl me over as it did the first time here.

And overall the food and the service was really excellent.  I wanted to try some different things so I got the only salad on their menu, a mini chop salad, which was fresh and delicious.  My only complaint is that they don't have a huge variety of salads, but what they do have is delicious.

We also tasted the pork belly buns which were phenomenal, as was the lonely bird burger I had.  Normally I would try to stay on the beef path on a burger place, but seeing that Rick Moonen had enjoyed this sandwich, I wanted to give it a shot.  I am not a fan of chicken burgers but this was flavorful and great.

My advice, if you have complained about Bachi Burger in the past, and you happen to be somewhat near to the area, I would give them a second try.  They are definitely going to be on my regular rotation for restaurants."}
{"text":"Normally great food. But the fish sandwich was more like a fish skin sandwich. And it cost more. 
Service has slipped, also."}
{"text":"Place is not that good. Used to work their and the staff wasn't polite so on with the managers. I wouldn't ever send someone here to eat because it's a slow staff. Red Robin for the win!"}
{"text":"Well...where do I start? The overly chilied everything? The meh soggy fries? The \"no we don't have a happy hour cause business is slow\" ?  A medium cooked burger is slightly pink not raw and red. AND medium well shouldn't be pink and oozing blood either. I had such high hopes for this desolate strip mall burger joint. Back to the fries, they were Mac Donald's drenched in some sort oily concoction. The pseudo metro wanna be's really need some self help or customer service wake up calls. Two burgers and beers shouldn't be $50 with pan atitude. Maybe I'm having a man period,  but com'on what a joke this place is!"}
{"text":"I had High Expectations for this place. Been wanting to try them since their episode on Diners Drive Ins and Dives...

I came here for one thing, the Pork Belly!. I am from San Francisco where chinese food such as Peking Duck, Pork Buns etc. are in abundancre. However, I couldn't wait to try the Pork Belly at Bachi's. So? the Pork Belly Bao's are just oka6y. I imagined them tasting sooo much better from watching the episode on Diners. The actual chinese steam bun was not hot or even warm, they were cold. The worst part of a cold bun is that when a chinese steam bun gets cold it firms up, so the warm and soft texture of the bun is no longer. Also, the pork belly was not executed well. In the Diners episode it shows they dredge the pork belly lighly in corn starch then deep fry to give a suttle crunch texture, then they pan sautee it with the actual pork belly marinade. This clearly was not the case when we dined there. The pork looked as if it was only tossed in a pan with some oil. 

The Ox Tails fries sound better than they actually taste. Literally there is no taste distinction that will cause you to identify actual Ox Tail in the chilli. It could be turkey for all I know. Literally tastes like your traditional chilli, with their asian inspired mayo over it. Not much fusion here.

Miyagi burger was actually good. The burger was executed nicely and all the flavors were on point. I hate to say it, it also took about a solid 7 minutes for us to even get some service to our table. And the worst part was there was only 2 other tables being served in the entire resturaunt at that time. 

I would rate both Food & Service a 6.5 out of 10 across the board! 

Unfortunately, I probably wont be dining here again. $98 for a meal that I waited for, for years just to be left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Did a late night takeout order, ordered The Bah Mi burger (my favorite burger) and decided to order the oxtail chili cheese fries. I really enjoyed the burger but the oxtail chili cheese fries I didn't really satisfy my palate. It tasted a little sweet and the beans over powered the taste of the oxtail. I ordered it because of all the rave reviews about it but I wasn't as satisfied. Maybe I just have to try it in the restaurant instead of doing take it... I'll give it another try..."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries with the fried egg (It's a huge portion by the way). I asked for the chili on the side because I don't eat meat. I tried the oxtail chili because I have to try everything once and I couldn't believe it but I actually loved it! I love the crusty crab sandwich. It's always my favorite."}
{"text":"This place was very good! The burgers were cooked perfectly and had a good vibe going on! I got a drink with Whiskey and Mint and it was the BEST Cocktail I have had!! We will for sure go back to check out other items on the list!"}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends here. Casual atmosphere and they do not take reservations.  Had the Ronin Burger and it was good, but not great. Expected more after all of the reviews.  Our group had the Sweet Potato fries, Salt and Pepper fries, the regular fries, a Ronin Burger and the Crab Sandwich.  Overall consensus was that it was OK, but not outstanding as expected.  Service was good and they have an extensive boba, soda, and drink menu. Skip Bachi and go to BurGR if you only have time for one burger joint in town and don't mind the strip.  I probably will also not bother going to the Bachi Burger they are opening in Westwood when in town, since Father's Office, 25 Degrees and so many other much better burger places are in LA."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi burger, as seen on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, it truly looked out of this world! But sadly, the experience was still on this world and I would rather enjoy Guy's actual restaurant (see previous review)

We arrived in Vegas on Saturday and came by just about 11:00am, their opening time, with already a packed house and waiting patrons! That seemed to be a good sign!
The interior is simple, modern asian-esqu themed, bamboo and wood but it was a calming atmosphere. 

Our waitress was nice and friendly, and gave suggestions on items

today we ordered the following: 

Shogun burger: wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and Yamamoto peach; overall, for $26 i think this burger is ridiculously overpriced..
the beef, (i have had wagyu before) was very bland and overcooked; the sauce around it was good however; the foie gras was virtually minimal and the unagi was gone in a bite; the peach was very interesting to eat first too though and sweet! the bun was fresh and soaked up the flavors nicely; overall, a 3/5 for the burger

oxtail chili fries: these were very good but could have been better; the fries were nicely cooked, chili was delicious! oxtail was tender and mounded over everything! the egg was as tiny as can be and gone in two bites; the garlic aioli was also not enough

pork belly bao: this came as three, and the menu stated it came with \"boiled egg, cilantro, scallions, hoisin bbq and vinaigrette; well there was no egg, no scallion and almost no cilantro...the sauce was good but overall definitely not a good boa

kale salad: this was okay...mom ordered this and I did not try it

chili fried chicken: this was probably the best dish of all; chili, garlic, ginger, not too spicy, juicy, flavorful, 5/5!

Overall, I think Bachi is kinda overrated, especially the original location i expected a lot more; MAYBE a return to the LA locations closer to home"}
{"text":"During my visit to Vegas for the sema show my good friend said he saw this place on a cooking show and had to eat there. What are friends for? This place was great! I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the staff was very friendly and really good about explaining all the goodness they have to serve there. I can't remember the name of the burger I ate but it was tall and delicious. The buns were so soft they were like clouds. The fries we had were also really good. I truly enjoyed my visit and my meal there. If you're ever in Vegas, do yourself a favor and eat here. I truly wish they had one in South Florida."}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5 stars but this place is awesome! 

I've been here twice already, last time I got the kiki burger.

Fries are delicious, love the sauce that comes with it. 

Def would come here again!"}
{"text":"My friend had recommended this place, and it's GREAT. The gourmet burgers are different and delicious. We had the Edamame Soybean Stir fried with Garlic, Ginger, and Chili. It has an asian flair with the ginger and chili oil, but very good. The Truffle Parmesan Fries were also good, I really liked the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli it came with. We had gotten the Ronin Burger, which was very good. It had a bit too much cole slaw for me, but it was still good. We also got the KiKi Burger, which I really liked."}
{"text":"Great food. Happening environment. I love their burgers. Very juicy and tasty. This place is portion control though.
Definitely will be back. I also like their Summerlin location too."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since the day it opened. I absolutely LOVE this place. I watched the evolution of this place. I've had almost everything on the menu. I've always had quality service when I've been there and the food has been top notched. If you're a true foodie, you need to try this place out. It's a different take on burgers and other american classics so be prepared. I feel you have to have an open mindset when coming in here. I think that people who have given poor quality reviews have not necessarily understood how fusion cuisine works and that's OK! It's been a trending place and I see whether it's the burgers, oxtail fries and even the Shoku menu will continue to grow and succeed."}
{"text":"this place was recommended to me a few different times and i finally was able to try it out and it is amazing! i had the kalbi burger and it was one of the best tasting things i've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing special for the price that you pay. The truffle fries were pretty good, but that's about it.

Not sure if it's this location specifically, but the service was horrible. Went at a time when it wasn't busy and our server was nowhere to be found most of the time. When she did deign to come to our table, she was rude, would reach over and grab things without asking if we were done, and then sulk off when we told her we were still working on it. 

Wanted to try this place for the longest and was so let down when I finally did."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The Banh Mi burger was amazingly good.  The Oxtail french fries are a must have.  The decor is a bit strange with this large wall dividing the half of the restaurant.  Giving it 4 out of 5 stars because you can't get a domestic beer.  Asian/American fusion.....may want to offer a couple domestic beers.   

The food is outstanding.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Edamame beans soaked in garlic, ginger, chili!! BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Friends were on a long layover here so I picked them up and took them straight here to eat. We sat and were getting ready to order when two workers came and told us the health department was there and their water isn't hot enough, they are getting shut down. The second worker said \"we will make it up to you\" and told us to leave quietly, but that's all he said so not really sure what that meant. Some people were currently eating, not sure how that went for them. Seems like they were trying to quickly and quietly get people out before health department made an announcement. I know restaurants have violations from time to time but I'd there is no hot water early in the day when there are very few customers, you should know it's unacceptable to serve food. Not hot enough to wash dishes or even hands! 
** they lied. They were on dirty dining a week later and were shut down for a week due to the massive roach infestation. Nasty."}
{"text":"This is cool.  Very different way to look at a hamburger.  Ordered 3 dishes that no way complimented each other yet all 3 were very good.   Had the burger with foie gras and it was fantastic  Burger was cooked perfectly.   All the components worked well together.  

Give this place a try you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"YUMMY! After stalking Bachi Burger on Yelp for a few months we finally decide to head down and check this place out.....but it was closed!! :( SUPER SAD FACE! But not to be derailed by their holiday closing we returned the very next day 37 seconds before they opened. Yeah, cause thats how Tanya S rolls!

When you first enter you notice how clean everything looks. Nice tables, lighting ext. The ambiance was on! We were immediately greeted by the hostess who took excellent care of us as well.

We started of first with the pecking duck buns (~$12 for 3) and they were SO good. The pecking duck was toped with a slice of boiled egg and some greens.....it also came with a dipping sauce that was so tasty.

Next we had to share the Truffle and Parmesan fries (~$4). These were AWESOME! The tamatoey dipping sauce was perfect and the overall taste just won me over.

I had the Ronin Burger (~$9) and it was amazing! It was a teriyaki based burger with fried egg on it, Asian slaw, and caramalized onions. Every now and then I would take a bite and get a little too much ginger for my taste but the burger was amazing! The meat was cooked medium and the bun was so good.

We had planned to try desert but by this time we were stuffed! So on the menu next time we venture to BB: Ox Tail Soup and the mini doughnuts. 

If I wasn't already taken I would marry Bachi Burger....just saying"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is okay.  I had the miso spicy burger.  I was not a fan of the bun and the hamburger itself did not have much flavor.  The sweet potato french fries were okay, didn't have much flavor.  To top it all off, we waited about 20 minutes for our food to be served.  There was only one other small group there.  It was a little early, 1000 hours, but c'mon..really, and they charged us for a refill of lemonade."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers? Heck yes! Thanks Smitcha B. for this recommendation on our weekend trip to Las Vegas. 

First off, you will have to wait for a table. They're always packed here but for very good reasons: Asian fusion gourmet $10 burgers. Worth it when you're visiting Las Vegas or live out there. 

Plentiful appetizers: Oxtail chili fries (delish), roasted duck Chinese rolls (Bao), yes please. 

Gourmet burgers? I don't remember the name of my burger but I think I scarfed it down in a matter of minutes (it was that good). They also have good beers and service here. 

This location off of Windmill is about 5-10 south of the Strip (I-15S)."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger doesn't accept reservations, and our wait was about an hour.  There was about 4 parties ahead of us and plenty of tables available in the back to seat everyone, so don't know why we had to wait so long.  Our waitress took our order, but did not write anything down on a notepad. We ordered appetizers, burgers and fries.  She forgot to place our order of fries.  Half way through our burgers we finally were able to flag down another server to get our fries.  They apologized and placed our order of fries and charged us for one.  The service was okay, but the food was very delicious.  For appetizers, we had the duroc pork belly steamed buns with cilantro, scallions, radish with Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin BBQ sauce. The pork belly was a thick cut, tender and flavorful, and the steamed buns were soft and warm.  The pork buns were really yummy.  My hubby had the Ronin burger - angus beef with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ and yuzu citrus aioli,  and I had the Kikis burger - angus beef with sauteed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.  Loved the juicy burgers with the Asian toppings and flavors.  We had our fries towards the end of meal - sweet potato fries which were tasty, and the truffle parmesan fries with parmesan reggiano topped with black truffle porcini cream sauce.  The cream sauce was rich and would have preferred to have the sauce on the side.  Overall, we enjoyed our Asian American fusion burgers and appetizers, but the service needs some improvement."}
{"text":"That was the best burger I have ever had. Wow 
Bacon was caramelized 
Onion rings were tempura style. 
Beef was great. 
Bun was soft a bit sweet but had been toasted so there was more texture."}
{"text":"This place was the location of a friend of mine's birthday party.  He initially reserved 10 seats but there ended up being 15 of us.  Now, any normal restaurant would accommodate the additional people, but not this place.  They were more concerned about the other reservations, than the people standing around the tables, waiting for chairs, let alone another table to slide up to the group.  Then, on top of that, the waitress that was taking the order fully admitted to us that she was underage, but was still serving alcoholic beverages to our party, which last time I checked, I believe that's illegal.  The ordering was rushed, every question was replied by the waitress as \"i dont know, I've heard its good\", which in plain english means I have no idea what it tastes like.  The food was ordered, it took a good solid 30-45 min to get it, however, their additional servers were among the slowest I've ever seen.  I ordered some of the garlic and pepper fries since none of their burgers come with fries ( a severe crime if you ask me), but I wanted to give the food a fair chance regardless of crappy service.  The burger was the Ronin burger, which after reviewing the menu, had ALOT of ingredients, over 7 to be exact, including custom condiments which after tasting, i could do without.  The burger itself fell apart when i took my first bite, leading me to believe their cooks don't fully understand how to properly prepare the angus beef they claim to be using and just shovel it onto the bun, hoping no one will notice or care.  It was well done at least, not juicy at all, which i assume is why there was so many toppings to the burger to compensate for the lack thereof.  Our order of garlic and pepper fries came out about 20 min after we got our burgers, and to my suprise, it was jalapeno pepper fries, not black pepper like normal people use.  I can't handle spicy foods all that well, I tried 2 fries, and I was done, heartburn kicked in and I was miserable and upset that I paid $4 for fries that on the menu, said NOTHING about the pepper being Jalapeno peppers.  This lack of detail will seriously hurt this restaurant, along with the severely poor service and treatment of guests.  Then, after we ate, the server came back out and asked us all what we ordered because she screwed up the bills.  We paid in cash for our bill, and the server never came back with our change, again, I believe that's illegal as well.  So its a good thing we didn't pay with large bills, otherwise she might have thought she was being tipped massively for being a complete idiot.  I complained that I didn't even receive our receipt for the meal, and she looked at us like we're the idiots.  This place has a interesting concept, however, the size of the seating area, combined with inept service and shitty management, will be its downfall.  I'll be amazed if it lasts a year or two at the most."}
{"text":"Burger is awesome. Not the healthiest but greasy and juicy jist the way your mouth likes it. They also carry hitachino beer in tap. How awesome is that? Minus star for the wait. Waiting sucks."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment!!!!!!

I've had Bachi burger bookmarked for the longest and even had friends who went and loved it! So, today, while choosing a place to eat, I chose Bachi over Max Brenner. Yep. Big mistake. 

We ordered the truffle parmesan fries and salt and pepper fries.
For our burgers we ordered the ronin burger and spicy miso.

We waited 30 minutes for our fries and after complaining, our waitress said she didn't know we wanted the fries to come out first. Wthh.... . She gave us the sauces free of charge which was nice of her. Even though ALL the sauces tasted weird and citrusy. I thought the pineaple ketchup would taste like the special ketchup at Umami but it didn't. As matter a fact it tasted like regular ketchup.

Our fries finally came out and I was disappointed with my truffle parmesan fries. The truffle sauce were drizzled lightly and only got on the first layer of fries.
Our burgers came out looking so delicious! We both ordered rare. Taking the first bite of my miso burger, I could taste a slight miso taste and then just like that, it went away. And that was it. No other taste! From that point on it tasted like i was eating tasteless meat. The meat were tender but not juicy. I didn't even bother trying boyfriend's burger because he said the same thing about his."}
{"text":"Came here at the rec of my baby bro. Walked in and there was a sign for \"Please wait to be seated\". So we waited....and waited...and waited...It wasn't busy and there were several avail tables.

After about 20 mins, we were finally seated. Annoyed and hungry, we had already reviewed the menu and knew what we wanted to order.

-Sapporo ($5)
-Short Rib Steamed Bun ($13.50): OK, but a bit of the dry side. 
-Kikis Burger ($8.50): I had this protein style, which was perfect. The mushrooms added great flavor to the patty.
-Banh Mi Burger ($8.50): It was good! Although I liked the Kiki burger better. 
-Truffle Parm Fries ($4): Not bad, although I would prefer it without the brown sauce they smothered the fries with. 

Total was about $43.

We didn't get our beer, so had to ask for beers and waters (and subsequent refills). I noticed that other tables-who were seated after us-began getting their orders before ours and I had to ask the status of our order. The server was apologetic, and relayed that they didn't expect the place to get busy since they just recently opened for business. I found this bothersome and disappointing. Perhaps they need a better strategy to improve their business operations ???

After an hour and a half at a burger joint, I was over it. Sorry, but we didn't leave a tip. I didn't feel it was deserved with the wait time experienced, total duration in the restaurant and not be adequately serviced. 

The one star given is for the appreciation of the Asian inspired burgers and other offerings and creations. This place has potential and it looks as though it will have a strong following given prior reviews. 

Perhaps, it was an \"off\" night; however, there could still be awesome customer service but they failed to deliver even that."}
{"text":"A lot of people like to compare Bachi to Umami... but I think Bachi wins that competition by far (I am personally not a fan of Umami). They have a new location that opened up in Summerlin which is great because there is rarely ever a wait! 

We ordered some Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to share - it is served with garlic aioli dipping sauce and a fried egg. These fries are a must order if you ever come to Bachi Burger. I have tried the Ronin Burger - angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, with a fried egg and katsu BBQ Sauce - delicious burger and a group favorite. 

On my most recent visit I tried Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - Wagyu meat with chili mayo, caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, topped with furikake and a fried egg. This burger was bomb, loved every bite of it. 

They have a nice selection of milk tea drinks and specialty sodas that are worth a try as well. Great place for an upscale burger."}
{"text":"We visited Bachi Burger because it was recommended by friends.  I ordered their No meat here burger which was a Shitake mushroom Patty topped with eggplant, mixed greens and tofu.  It was very hearty, I did not miss the meat!  The sandwich was so huge that I had to use a fork and knife to eat it.  The bun was the best bun i've every had with a burger, wish I could have taken a dozen home with me.  We also ordered the truffle fries and I tasted my friends Ox tail chili cheese fries which was unreal!  My husband had a Angus burger which he will talk about in his own review.  There are many other menu items that i'd like to try.  Going back there again the next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger stops!
The unique flavors here have me coming back whenever I'm in Vegas, going on six years now. You really can't go wrong here, the entire menu is great. The Ronin and Miyagi-San burgers are my two favorites, and honestly two of the best burgers I've tasted..patties cooked and seasoned perfectly, wonderfully crafted for maximum flavor. The Ban Mi, Kalbi and Kiki's burgers are very good as well. Their Yuzu aioli sauce perfectly compliments the sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries very tasty as well. Only issues I have, their boba teas are too heavy on the milk here for my taste..and beef patties are ground very fine here, but the texture has grown on me.

Service here is always spot on, maybe because we avoid the busy times. 
Bachi Burger truly is outstanding and lives up to all of the hype."}
{"text":"Ingredients for a good burger restaurant:
1) The bun - Crisp and shiny outside, soft and flavorful inside and the condiments aren't soaked into the bun.
2) The burger - cooked thoroughly but not overcooked.  Flavorful on its own and enhanced by the toppings, not overwhelmed by them.
3) The toppings, choices and freshness are key.  Limp Lettuce and soggy onion rings just don't do it. (Sorry Whopper bar).  

Bachi Burger may have it all.  The texture, the color, the flavor.... YUM really says it all.  The place is a bit dark but the service was good. The combinations of beef and toppings, whether you prefer Angus or Wagyu, all seem to work well.  Their fries are good too. 

If you prefer a traditional burger, or to pick your toppings you can do that too.  All in all this is one of the better burger options."}
{"text":"I do not get their burgers, but i do get the ramon. And i always am in love when i get it. And you can have spicy to any of the ramons to choose from. The staff is very pleasant. However, get there early you will be waiting."}
{"text":"Got the Lonely Bird because I don't eat red meat. Wow!!! Not only was it amazing, our waitress was on point with her service. She gave us suggestions, our glasses never went empty and was genuinely nice. 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Came here expecting to have the artichoke dip, boo I guess they discontinued it from their menu. Nonetheless, still a fan"}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is a happening little spot that's off strip. The locals enjoyed it until the non-locals found out about it. Now it's a long wait, but the food is still great. The variety of burgers still amazes me.. if you're feeling like Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, or just plan American style, there's a burger to fit your taste buds. My favorite is the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Ronin Burger (a burger with a fried egg, yum!) We've tried the Oxtail chili fries a few times. I know some people rave about it, but I'm still not a fan. It just tastes like bbq sauce and chewy meat to me.. 

Overall, burgers taste gourmet and satisfy any greasy craving. Eat fast though, because people will be wanting your seat!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and will definitely not be last. Came out here for the weekend and I yelped this place at the last min. Reviews do not lie! This place is delicious and unique. The asian fusion that the burger had left a memorable taste. 
I ordered the Miyagi-San's Burger...was totally blown away by the flavors. I didn't really know what furikake or wagyu beef was but damn...I'm sure those were the main flavors. They gave it an asian fusion twist to it. The patty was so juicy...perfect! It was a bit pricey but I didn't mind that. I would pay that price again. I'm coming back here when I visit Vegas again to try their specialty fries!"}
{"text":"My 500th review.... WOW. FIVE HUNNIDD. 5 hundred ones.

On my 2nd trip back to Vegas in as many weeks, I just had to have more of Bachi Burger. I met a grade school classmate who lives in town at the original location on Windmill. It was my first time at this location. It was just a little after 11am on a Friday. I had just landed at McCarran. From the airport, I got my rental car and drove the short distance to Bachi. I was seated right away being that they just opened. I was seated towards the back by the window on the way to the restrooms but still had full view of  the entire restaurant. 

Waited a little while for my friend as she was in transit but stuck in traffic. The waiter we had made sure to check on me a couple of times and I started off with the oxtail cheese fries. It was served just in time as my friend sat down. Great timing!.. The oxtail chili cheese fries were as good as I remember. Perfectly crisp fries, tender strips of oxtail strewn about amongst cheese, chili (with beans), jalapeno slices & cilantro. Oh and dont forget the fried egg on top... Good stuff.

For my entree, I ordered the pork belly steamed buns (3 pieces) instead of a burger. It's just so tasty and perfect in its bite sized form. The soft & delicious still warm steamed bun, cradling the slightly crisp on the edges but buttery soft pork belly with hoisin sauce, sliced hard boiled egg & cilantro (i dont even like cilantro!) combination is so damn good. Its one of my most favorite cravings these days. Thankfully the Sawtelle location opened the same exact day I was at the OG location. I'm definitely going there to get my fix and to support my friend's cousin who is a line cook there. 

My friend ordered the Miyagi-san burger with furikake, fried egg, chili mayonnaise, honey bacon and onion rings. It was good but the patty was overcooked to well done as my friend specifically ordered it medium-well. I also found it to be super sticky eating. Even the bun was kind of sticky. It could have been better.

Service was good, attentive. I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows I was sitting at needed some dusting and I didnt like seeing a couple of flies buzzing by the window blinds. Parking was plentiful because its in a shared lot with several other businesses. Bachi gets full in a hurry. Within a half hour of me being seated (11:15am) the place was packed...Shoku Ramen's (formerly next door) menu is served at Bachi Burger now, so the paper signs say. Thank you Bachi Burger but I think I like the Summerlin location better. You know what they say about first loves... They  never die. And Summerlin won me over at first bite."}
{"text":"How much do I love thee, Let me count the ways... You had me at first bite with the oxtail fries. Then fell more in love with the pork belly and it was game over with the shogun burger. Dammnnnnn... So good. All of it... I had been wanting to eat here for a few years now but never could align the stars whenever I was in town. My friends that had tried it, raved about it and I've been kicking myself ever since. I finally went here a few weeks ago and am so glad I did. I saw the light. All the flavors I tasted were delicious.

We first had the oxtail chili cheese fries that was topped with an egg and drizzled with garlic aioli. It was delicious. I love oxtail. I love chili cheese fries and this was a perfect marriage of both things. The fries were perfectly fried and the tender oxtail covered in cheese, cilantro & jalapeno slices were great together. The latter two i'm not big on but I ate around them and would probably eat them if it was the only way to sample this great appetizer. I definitely recommend it. It was great. I really enjoyed it.

The other thing I had before my burger was the pork belly steamed bun. It was very VERY good. 4 come in one order. Perfectly cooked and tender pork belly (a little crisp on the outside) in a small steamed bun sammich with some slices of hard boiled egg, radish, cilantro (again!), scallions and hoisin sauce. It was perfect. It was so good that I ate the cilantro and i was good. And i HATE cilantro.. I always tell my friends I don't eat weeds. Hahah... But seriously, I dont like the after taste but soldiered through it cause I figured that the chef meant it to be eaten that way and the least I can do is follow suit. That and it looked so good & I was hungry and couldnt wait so I just dug in. Order it... trust me.

On to the burger... I ordered the shogun burger because I was on a mission to have foie gras as I miss having it at Los Angeles restaurants such as Animal & Mozza. The shogun burger has a patty that's wagyu beef. It's topped with unagi, yes unagi... pan seared foie gras (YUM), asian pears & peaches and a delicious butter on the bread. It  was all good. All the unique ingredients worked well and it was quite tasty. The wagyu patty was nice & tender. The unagi was soft & tasty. The foie gras was heavenly and I wish there was more. MORE. The asian pear & peach slices helped break up the richness of all the other ingredients. It was really a nice compliment to the burger. I really liked the burger big time. Glad it had foie gras. So glad I ordered it.

I had some of the sausage platter. There were 2 types of sausages (kurobuta & arabiki) on this plate. They were tasty. Good flavor. Nice smokey & sweet taste to them. The dipping sauce was honey mustard. But it didnt even really need one. The sausages were that flavorful. 

The drink I ordered was the plantation style sweet tea. It was good. A different kind of sweet tea. Hard to describe. Also tasty... 

Service was very good. We had a nice Filipino girl help our party of 7 that quickly became 9. She was friendly, was a good sport and got all our orders right. She also split the bill 3 ways which was nice. Thank you Bachi... Looking forward to eating there again soon. In fact, I'm flying out to Vegas in 36 hours. Wanna guess where I'm having brunch as soon as I land??"}
{"text":"First time here! Had the black and green and kiki burger.  Both were amazing, doesn't even need ketchup.  The crab avocado  dip was delicious too. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place! I'm not the biggest fan of burgers but when it's done right, I'm a fan. I saw this chain on Food Network's Triple D so we had to try it. Ambiance is great and plenty of parking (better than the other location). Oxtail chili cheese fries is a must and the burger I got, the Bahn Mi Burger, was amazing. I'm glad that they are opening up a location in Westside Los Angeles."}

{"text":"This Asian fusion burger joint is awesome 5/5! Upon arrival, I was greeted with the friendly server and was explained the menu. My group and I ordered the Truffle Fries, Oxtail fries, shogun burger and the spicy miso burger. The food was delicious and I HIGHLY recommend the Shogun burger ($26), though it's a bit pricey, it was worth it! I don't recommend the Taro bun unless you have a sweet tooth, I personally didn't like how the sweet bun countered the spicy miso sauce but overall the burger was tasty. The oxtail fries were SO delicious-- you won't regret!!!!"}
{"text":"I love how this place is open until 2AM! It's a great place to satisfy those late night cravings for foie gras! *

We ordered:

1. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50)
Oxtail is so good! The braised oxtail fries come with garlic aioli sauce along with a fried egg. The fries are very savory. Some people might not like it because there is a hint of sweetness. My defense is that it's supposed to balance the overall taste and not make it uber salty. A must try! (5/5)

2. Shogun Burger ($25) 
I only got this because of the foie gras! Get it while you can since who knows when the government wants to make it illegal as well in Nevada! The burger has delicious Wagyu beef and unagi (marinated eel), pan-seared foie gras, miso butter, and poached Asian pear. 

The server told us to eat the Yamamomo Peach first (it's in a little cup) because it's supposed to cleanse our palates to fully taste the foie gras and burger. Neat! Overall, I really liked the foie gras. However, the combinations of the other elements made the burger taste too sweet for me. I felt like they could do without the pear and the unagi. The foie gras was the saving factor. (4/5)

The place is located way off the Strip, so be prepared to make a bit of a drive (not too bad though). The service is friendly and there's cute art decor around the restaurant. There are other yummy burgers on the menu that I would like to try again next time. =)"}
{"text":"Second time eating here. By far the best burger joint I've tried so far. Quality of meat, customer service, portions deserve a five star rating. Thick cuts of ground beef and Korean marinates, very juicy melt in your mouth burgers"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in her on a whim.  We saw this episode of Triple D featuring this burger place wanted to give it try.  The burgers were amazing, and I am very picky about my fries, and these were good.  Our drink glasses were kept filled, which is a big deal to me.  If you looking for a non-standard style of burger, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best burger place ever! I'm not sure how anyone can give this place a bad rating. The burgers are so different yet so good. Like all new restaurants....you should ask the 3 favorite things on the menu!"}
{"text":"After a grueling drive from LA to Vegas, my mister and I wanted to grab a satisfying dinner.  We wanted something off the beaten path (not on the Strip), something the locals would frequent...Yelp lead me to Bachi Burger.  

When we arrived at the restaurant, it was pretty busy at 9PM on a Friday, but there was still a few tables available, so we were seated right away.  

Looking over the menu, I was impressed.  Their burgers had some asian flare.  I ordered the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which had Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon ,Crispy Onion Rings. The mister had the Bachi Fish which is Furikake Dusted Pan Seared Alaskan Cod Tartar Sauce, Lettuce, Onion, Tomato Bubu Arare Rice Crackers.  We also had the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries.  I washed it down with a sake cocktail: The \"Katsushiro\": White Peach, Strawberry Puree, Soda.  It was a yummiest, but I don't think it had a lot of alcohol because I didn't get relaxed from it.   

My burger was really tasty and very juicy.  I loved the asian inspired flavors.  It was so good I ate the whole think. The bachi fish was good, but it was a bit salty.  The fries were good too.  

Who knew that Vegas could have this kind of food and it wasn't on the strip.  Very cool.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visited this place a while back.  Just getting to the review.

Burger...
Ordered the Black & Green Burger.  
Very good.  Cooked to proper temp with all the toppings flavors coming through.  A very well made burger.

Sides....
Chili Cheese Fries.
Very tasty, but seemed a little over rated.  The oxtail was a nice touch.

Pork Belly Steamed Buns.
A few more of these can be a meal.  A real treat.

As far as the restaurant and the employees.  Everyone was real nice and helpful.  The waiter seemed to know the menu and was available to answer any questions.

When we pulled up, we could see the smoke coming out of the kitchen.  This is a good thing.  The smell was sweet burger heaven."}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm still not disappointed. Had the Ronin Burger. I must say it's a tasty burger, but I liked the Miyagi-san's grass Fed Wagyu burger better. I won't stop here, I'll try something different next time. Maybe there's a hidden treasure for me or maybe the Miyagi-San's burger is the burger for me. Also tried the Pork Belly steamed buns. I'm not big on pork, but what the neck, I'm in Las Vegas, I have to try something out of my comfort zone. They were good! Good to poach outside sometimes."}
{"text":"I recently stopped here for lunch with co-workers and the team loved the burgers. In particular, fresh ingredients and the buns were mentioned frequently.  We have other co-workers who give BB rave reviews as well."}
{"text":"Amazing burger spot just off the strip in Vegas. Brief highlights of what I ate- 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- The chili is the best part of this dish, got a decent little kick and melds well with the cheese and fries. The runny egg yolk on the top was also a great touch. Fries were cooked well enough to withstand the barrage of liquid from the other toppings. Our group destroyed these fries pretty quickly

Miyagi-san's burger- Great burger. The bacon/egg/onion ring combo is a classic set of burger toppings, but this burger took it to another level. Great quality ingredients that were combined very well. 

All in all, this place blew me away. After trying one of the traditional burgers, I'm even more excited to come back and try the build your own burger option."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. I have been hearing great things about them fr a while now so i thought i would stop in. The food was amazing, I had a custom burger and some ribs, my boyfriend had a Ronin burger, both were coold perfect and tasted wonderful. The service was spot on, Nick was suoer friendly and answered any questions we had. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and WOW!!! Oxtail chili cheese fries are a must.  Service was friendly and fast.  Little bit of a wait as its a small place and people just keep pouring in the door. Be ready for a 20 min wait."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to review this place.   Great gourmet burger joint with some surprising twists.  The burgers are Asian fusion which in some warped way works.  The selection of fries they have are insanely addictive.  The truffle Parmesan fries are my favorite.  

The other surprising twist is that this is also a ramen noodle shop.  The ramens are pretty authentic and reasonably priced.  Others I have been there with get ramens, I stick with the burgers.  :)    

They also do steamed Bao sandwiches.  The pork belly Bao is to die for.  This place is always slammed so expect a wait for a table.  The food is not cheap and borders on expensive but the quality of the food you gets makes it worthwhile.  

The service is bonkers considering how small the place is and hailing your server can be a challenge at times.   The bouncy and interested nature of the staff far outweighs how busy they are.  

If you have friends coming to town and want to show them some off strip Vegas goodness, you can't go wrong with Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Burgers are so amazing each bite delivers a different amazing combo of flavors. Take all our out of town guests to try. Never disappoints. Little wait to get in but not bad."}
{"text":"Let's touch base on the services at bachi burger. The  server that took our order said he will bring out a spicy paste on the side for me cause I requested on the side. When the food came out there wasn't any spicy paste. I flagged down a waitress and told her there was suppose to be a spicy paste on the side but she gave me a weird look and pointed to the chili powder which I knew she was wrong. I waited till another server walked by and she knew what paste I was talking about right away. She asked the waitress who gave me the weird look to hand it to me. In which she wasn't too happy about and just left it on the table. The whole time I was observing the waitress she seem frustrated and angry as if she was having a bad day. She never once smiled and also sighed every time someone asked her something. She never checked on me again or even asked if I wanted more ice tea when my glass was empty. Btw the menu says (unlimited ice tea). Honestly the food wasn't so bad we enjoyed the ramen and burger , but she completely ruin my lunch with my girlfriend and I. The worst part is that we are out of towners and my girlfriend has been hearing great stuff about bachi burger, but from the experience with the waitress she completely spoiled our meal and we'll probably never come back. If you're a server/waitress/waiter if you're having a bad day either don't come to work or suck it up and put a smiling face on. 50% of the experience at a restaurant is the service."}
{"text":"Another over rated and over priced burger place, dry wagyu burger...what a shame, ordered it medium rare and was over cooked to medium well.."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews but the place just didn't cut it. Me and my girlfriend are big foodies and burgers are always a staple. We were expecting some delicious and unique burgers based on all the hype (reviews, friends, etc.) but were extremely disappointed. First off the service was bad. He had a bit of a smart aleck attitude. My girlfriend got the Spicy Miso burger and even though she ordered medium rare she got medium well. No color at all. The egg that came in the burger was overcooked and there was no actual spice in the burger which was misleading by both the menu and server. They switched out our fries twice because they kept bringing us the wrong ones and when my girlfriend asked for honey mustard she got a very sarcastic \"no\" from the waiter. 

I ordered the famed Ban Mi burger which I liked. Nothing mind blowing but something new and tasty. Overall we probably won't be returning anytime soon....\"If at all\" my girlfriend adds. In our opinion we will stick with the In n Out staple or the surprisingly tasty Bobby Flay's Burger Palace."}
{"text":"So, I'm fairly sure that Bachi Burger #1 is famous (and busier) now after having been featured on Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" a couple of weeks ago.  It's nice to see local eats getting well-deserved attention.  I'm just happy as a clam that Bachi Burger #2 opened up in my neighborhood and it's just as good as the original.  It was my date's first time ever at Bachi and mine at this new location in Village Square.  We walked right in on Thursday night and were seated immediately.  Service was very attentive; our waitress checked on us often and certainly knew her beer, recommending a good one for me, who seldom drinks the stuff.  We started with steamed edamame, moving on to the Black and Green burger for myself and the Ronin burger for him with regular fries that we shared. The food came out quickly and we enjoyed every juicy bite. Bachi joins Firefly at Village Square in being two great food choices for those of us on the Westside.  Welcome to the neighborhood; we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Especially the OXTAIL FRIES! OMG. Those were bomb. I ordered the Black and Green Burger... Or was it Green and Black..? Anyways! It was pretty good. Kinda bitter cuz the the blue cheese and the veggies they put in it, but the sweet pieces of bacon balanced it out. I would've gotten the Kalbi burger (which was a whole lot tastier with kimchi goodness), but my boyfriend chose that and I didn't wanna get the same thing. 
We also got the Parmesan Truffle Fries. They were good... As an appetizer when you're really hungry and craving garlic. 

I didn't give this place 5 stars 'cuz the service kinda sucked to be honest. We sat there a lot longer than we should've before being greeted. The server came, and asked if it was our first time, and we said 'yes'. Then, he went over the menu us when we sat there for like 10 minutes looking at it ourselves and decided what to get, and then he was like \"I'll come back so you guys can look over the menu yourselves\". Right before he was going to walk away, I was like, 'Uh... We're actually ready\" considering the fact how hungry we were, and how long we were waiting there without getting drinks. 

I would definitely come back again and try the other items they have on the menu, and reunite with the Kalbi Burger and oxtail chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"This spot is actually up the street from my house. I like the whole presentation of their food very simple. The truffle fries can be very tasty. I ordered the bachi burger special and I can say it's very juicy texture not dry which is a plus. This place always has open seats so you don't have to worry about waiting."}
{"text":"The hype is real, people!

Prior to coming to Vegas, I was recommended by a friend to come check out this place. From my belief, there are 2 locations both off the strip. We went to the Windmill location which was about 20 minutes away. When we got there at 11am, there was already a small line starting to form. I got the grass-fed wagyu burger. It was good but it was a little bit on the sweeter side and I don't like my burgers sweet. I also got a chance to try the spicy miso burger. That was a little salty for me, but again, still very good. The winner of the day? The oxtail chili cheese fries. You will dieeee. Must get!!! 

Since our meal was so good, we decided to come back a second time the next day before leaving Vegas. This time around we tried the ramen. It's really rare that a burger joint would also serve ramen, let alone be good at it so I was extremely skeptical. BUT, much to my surprise, the ramen was so good as well! My favorite is the spicy ramen with extra meat. Their meat is sooo fatty and melts in your mouth but it's so good. I suppose being a fatty every once in a while is no biggie :)

Their service is amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. I will come back here every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Miyagi burger is the bomb. Quick service and food tastes great. Only been here once but i want to come again to try the other plates."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Las Vegas that I've found...excellent service as well.  Not cheap but worth it."}
{"text":"The Mr. Ho and Miyagi San burger is out of this world! By far the best burger i've ever had. The bread is so soft and lightly toasted. The burger is big and juicy! With a side of oxtail chili cheese fries and a glass of strawberry lemonade, i can easily say I've had the best of the best. Can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! 
Server Luis recommended the Miso burger.
It was incredible!! Had the salt & pepper garlic. Very  subtle garlic and jalapeno with fantastic spicy aioli! 
 Luis was extremely knowledgable! You can tell that he enjoys being 
Should have gone with his recommendation  of an IPA with the Miso burger and garlic fries! 

  Just a fantastic experience! Ask for Luis!"}
{"text":"I love this place I really do!! It is not your typical burger joint matter fact quiet the opposite. Asian hamburgers and quality ingredients and the prices are not outrageous for what you are getting. the oxtail fries are great and the burgers I have had so far have been awesome and Its honestly my mission in life to try them all. If you love to try something new than come here because this place is unique and high quality"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I decided to forego my usual trip to Yardhouse and have a bite here. The calamari is really good (if not much, but lots of flavor). I ordered the Miyagi-san, which was just bursting with taste. I will say that they put maybe a tad bit too much sauce, and the menu doesn't really do a great job of explaining what the size of the burgers are, so I ended up with the Miyagi-san, which is the size of a f'ing brick. Otherwise, you can't really beat the price and taste at this level."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We came for lunch and of course there was a wait...We split the Kiki burger with garlic fries and of course, we had to try the onion rings...Delish!  The burger was cooked perfectly, juicy wagyu beef with mushrooms and cheese.  I can't wait to go back and try something else like the oxtail fries or pork buns!"}
{"text":"Really good food, service was okay. A little on the pricey side, and as good as the good is, I'm not sure it's worth the food to price ratio. Worth experiencing a few times, a good change from the norm aswell but that's about it."}
{"text":"THE FAMOUS BACHI BURGER!

Been meaning to come here since I began my stay here in Vegas. Rumored to be the best burger and it did not disappoint. I don't know about BEST, but it did rank in the top burgers of my life. 

Right off the bat, service could be a lot better. There was a wait of 3 parties in the cramped lobby of the restaurant when you could PLAINLY see that there were 5+ open tables in the back. Our waitress told us there would be a 20-25 minute wait for a table of 5. So we went to the bar in the middle of the restaurant where there were at least 4 tables that could accommodate us... Sounds like a ploy to get us to spend more money on drinks! 

Well, it worked. The bar isn't the best. Drafts are a bit pricey, got a Sapporo for $5. But my friend got a well drink called \"Kambei\" that was DELICIOUS. It was minty and grapefruity and super refreshing. Highly recommend. 

So as soon as we got our drinks an empty table just happened to open up! And we were seated, 10 minutes into our estimated wait time..

ANYWAY, onto the food. I ordered/tasted: The Ronin Burger, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries, Truffle Fries, and Kalbi Burger. 

Ronin Burger: SO GOOD. I ordered medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. Really tender and juicy!  

Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Not the biggest fan of pork but the meat was tender and yumz. The buns though, were awesome! Perfectly steamed. 

Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries: These were amazing. My friends and I demolished them in 5 minutes. Meat melted in your mouth and the runny yolk of the fried egg made the dish. 

Truffle Fries: The garlic on this and the brown sauce was nommalicious! Def order these. 

Kalbi Burger: Took a bite of this from my friend and it was gooooood. The kimchi inside was clutch and the pickles on the side were essential to the pursuit of the \"perfect bite\". 

All in all, great food and well drinks. Highlights were the oxtail fries and the juicy & tender burgers. I'd recommend to a friend, but make sure your waitress doesn't hustle you with the seating."}
{"text":"A different type of burger joint. I would describe Bachi Burger as a Japanese fusion gourmet burgers. It's American burgers with an Asian twist to it, and you know what, the flavors work. I've been to Bachi Burger before and this location is a lot less crowded. Seating and decor is nice and intimate. I got the shogun burger to share. The burger was tasty, high-quality, fresh, and unique. We also got an order of fries to share. We went that hunger but there were other items on the menu that sound delicious like the oxtail chili cheese fries. The service here was good, but there were not that many people at the restaurant. Prices are fair and food is tasty. I'll probably be back someday but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wow. This place blew me away from their wonderful service to their tasty burgers. 

This Asian inspired BBQ joint brings burgers and fries to a whole new level!

The truffle parm fries were so good, but even better with the little orange dipping sauce. I like my fries thin and crispy so it was the perfect texture and crunch!

The oxtail chili cheese fries were pretty good. You can definitely taste the oxtail meat in the chili. Since I'm a fan of crispy fries, the chili soaks up my crunchiness.  great flavored and worth trying, but I like the truffle fries better.

I ordered the Kalbi burger which has Kim chee on the burger and it was DE-LICIOUS!  I'm a huge fan of Kim chee so I may be a little biased with this particular burger. 

Being greedy, I also took a bit of the friend's burger, the Miyagi San, and it was quite tasty also! If you like onion rings, this is your burger. 

And to continue being a fatty, haha, I also took a couple of bites of the KiKi burger with a fried egg.  BOYYYYYY!!!!!!! If you like mushrooms, this is your burger! The mushroom flavor in this burger is so strong and powerful, but not too much like garlic. I was so full from snacking on everything else, I still took another bite.  

Each burger and fries concoction has its own flavors and ingredients. You wouldn't be able to taste the same flavors in another burger based on the items we ordered today. This will be a place I stop for every time I visit Vegas. 

What happens in Vegas.......gets posted on YELP!"}
{"text":"I normally go to the other bachi burger closer to the strip, so I tried this one since it's closer to where we are staying.  We made reservations but it still took about 10 minutes to seat a party of 10 down. The service is a little slow for a not so busy restaurant. We had to ask for our cups to be refilled a few times and there are still dirty plates in my face as I'm writing this review, waiting for our checks. The fries and burgers are good, but it can be better. If I come back to Bachi burger, it would be the other one."}
{"text":"Love the salted caramel shake and the Kiki burger! The wait for food is long but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Oxtail and truffle fries are the way to go.... It's simply amazing!!! Best fries I have eaten at a gourmet burger place. The sauces on both of the dishes makes me crave for more!!
Burgers are good also, but IMO the flavors get too overwhelming after the first couple bites. If only they had one somewhere down in Cali near my area :-("}
{"text":"They were out of a lot of ingredients and couldn't serve half of their menu. We came in at 12 and they'd been open for an hour. 

Service was also really poor. They served our food and we didn't have any space on the table. They could've at least offered to take some plates out of the way. Our server hardly came back to check on us. Only to tell us that they were out of something lol.

The food, or whatever they could actually serve, was alright. One of our orders (wagyu burger) was ridiculously burnt and charred. We got our fries hecka late too.

Don't believe the hype. Or if you do, just don't go to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to Bachi Burger three times now, and I absolutely LOVE it here! I brought my man here (he's from Utah) and he's definitely in love with this place more than I am. They serve gourmet burgers here and yes, they're on the pricey side BUT it's worth it because of the quality of the foodies that they serve here. 

Quality of food: DELICIOUS! I usually get the Kiki Burger (I haven't tried any others), and it never disappoints. There's loads of flavor and the meat is just so tender and juicy! I almost always pair it up with the Parmesan Truffle Fries. BOMB DOT COM EXPLOSION IN YO' MOUTH! I actually tried the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries today & it's still pretty delicious! I still prefer the Truffle Fries over it. My man and our daughter get the sweet potato fries - And they love it! I've tried it and I actually really like it as well. 

Service: Variable, and this is the reason why I docked a star from them. Because the food is made to order, it takes awhile. But HEY! Not complaining because when you taste that burger.. Oh goodness, you'll be in Heaven! Servers are actually really friendly here, and they're accommodating. They check up on you every so often.

Other than their variable service, what's there NOT to like about this place? Great ambiance plus great food is definitely what'll keep me coming back."}
{"text":"* Bachi Burger had a very island vibe which made you want to bob your head. The workers were also very friendly and answered all the questions we had to ask. 

* The \"burger\" was unlike any that I've seen before; it had no buns, or any typical qualities of a burger. The patty itself was okay, nothing to rave about, but the rice underneath was very unique tasting. It had a creamy texture and this tocino sauce to mix with it. (Tocino is a sauce that most Filipinos use for recipes) The burger came with the macaroni - typically found in Hawaiian restaurants. I normally don't like that style of macaroni so, like-wise, I wasn't a big fan of the macaroni. Although some may like it more than I did. The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing though. It had that slight sweet taste of chocolate and the beautiful cheese texture -- btw. I love cheese, so that was a plus -- sprinkled on top. This entire thing fed 2 people and filled us both to the rim. We were stuffed. 

* Pricing were around the ranges of $20, but there were like 2 burgers that were $8; although, the burger I ordered was $17. The overall price for the fries and burger came out to be $27. 

* Would I come back? Maybe, but not something I would probably say \"oh. Let's go to Bachi\", but just in-the-moment kind of drop-bye. 

* Rate: 8/10
* Pricing: $$"}
{"text":"We saw the restaurant on TV's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. It looked like the perfect place to start our gastro tour of Vegas. We tried everything that was featured on the show. The Steamed Buns have seared pork belly seasoned just right. It's a great starter. The oxtail chili fries are so different that you just can't slow down when eating them, which you should because the Burger that is coming next is just delicious. I had the Binh Burger that's made with beef port, and shrimp. Yes, shrimp. 
Try the Thatch Tea to accompany your meal. 

Great service in s little restaurant way off of downtown or the strip."}
{"text":"I came here with seven other coworkers for an early lunch at 11am today. The restaurant had one other table with customers. We all ordered burgers (which came out like 30-40minutes later) but I never got mine. So I asked if they forgot my order, and our server just said, \"hold on,\" went inside to check, then came back and said \"sorry. Its coming out now.\" It was obvious that he missed my order because he had to ask me what I had ordered. He didnt even ask me if I still wanted my burger since everyone else at my table was already almost done. Anyways, long story short, i didnt want to make a scene so I just asked to put the burger in a takeout box. Asked for the pineapple ketchup but never got it. And I was charged full amount. I sure wasn't happy about it at all. My friend asked for takeout box but she never brought one, so she ended up asking another server for it. My $16 burger doesnt taste that great now that its been sitting in a box since im back at work now. What a unhappy experience."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying this: I have been here twice and I have not had the privilege of eating here even once!

Visit #1: Walked in an waited 10 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge that we were waiting for her. She was at a table speaking with other guests and looked up at us at least 4 times prior to coming over, and all the while acting as though we were inconveniencing her. We gave our name and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. She promptly went back to the same table to ham it up with the customers. 45 minutes later, we walked out, amazed that a simple, accurate wait time could not be provided. 

Visit #2: Provided our name to the hostess and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. It was busy, so we were asked to please wait outside (mind you, it is summertime in Vegas). At 20 minutes I went back in asking how long it would be. The hostess advised another 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, my daughter PASSED OUT OUTSIDE because she was too hot and because we couldn't wait inside. Obviously we left immediately after that episode.

My opinion? This place is not worth the wait, or the irresponsible manner in which they give their wait times. The service is severely lacking. I won't be back, and the sad thing is, I can't even comment on the food!!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed about the oxtail fries. For one thing I LOVE oxtail and when I ordered this.....it really didn't taste anything like oxtail, for all I know it could of been shredded chicken, OK i'm exaggerating a little but you get the point that it didn't taste like oxtail. Also had a few bites of my wifeys burger and it was OK, nothing really to die for or make me want to come back for sure to this place. One thing that was good here was their service, our waiter was really nice and made our dinner here worth while, but this is a restaurant and I did come here to eat, so I really expected the food here to be really good considering the ratings here and how big the bill was =( I probably won't be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"I tried the original bachi burger and was amazed how polished and juicy this burger was. My burger was only for $7 and the moist burger was a welcome sight to see, because as soon as I bit into my burger, all the juices/marinate flowed down my plate. This was awesome. Easily the best burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh.  Took forever for us to get our food.  Burger was too densely packed and the bun was stale.

Lame-O."}
{"text":"What else can I add that more than 800 reviews haven't already covered. I went here for dinner with my Yelp husband Justin G. and our friend Robin G. for dinner.

Now I should let you know that I'm not a fan of hamburgers whatsoever, and Justin knows this yet still chose this place for dinner. Whatever. The place was absolutely packed, as it was a Saturday night. Robin waited for nearly 40 minutes when we got there and we still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Crazy busy!

Wow, so this place is definitely a little speedy as all the sides are priced separately. I ordered the regular sized Caesar salad ($7). Robin ordered the ox tail fries - $11 worth of delicious. My salad was not the greatest, but it did come with a little anchovy on top. Justin ordered truffle fries to share and they were delicious, but could have used a little more sauce. 

2 burgers, 2 fries and my salad came out to more than $50. It's just a little too spendy for my tastes for what it we received."}
{"text":"This place offers unique burgers and ramen. There was no wait - we also went around 4pm. There is usually a long wait here,  around 30 to 45 minutes. The service was very fast and staff was friendly. I ordered the white and red sangria and they were both equally delicious! We also had the truffle fries, which are always fantastic and come with a tomato type sauce to dip in. I ordered the Myagi-san burger and it was amazing,  although the egg was a little overcooked for my taste. My husband ordered the shoyu ramen and it wasn't as good as usual. There was an strong flavor of tap water in the broth. This place is amazing 9 times out of 10. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes ramen or unique Asia inspired burgers."}
{"text":"Too much hype, in my opinion. The place was fun and busy! I really did have a good time here, but I honestly felt like I've had much better burgers before. I love their creativity though! I'll still come here again, but it isn't the best I've ever had. 

I ordered the oxtail fries with my family. This dish was the restaurant's saving grace for me. These fries were crisp and the chili was tasty and meaty! Sooooo incredibly good, but fries aren't supposed to be what makes a burger place. 

I got the Kalbi Burger. I ordered my kimchi on the side since I wanted to avoid it overpowering my burger. I'm glad I did because that kimchi was disappointing to me. Their kimchi is too sweet in my opinion, not up my alley. The burger was alright. I really liked the soft bun, but the patty was just okaye. What I was impressed with were the size of the burgers, since all the pictures make the burgers look smaller than they really are. I was really full after I finished, but it was just an okay burger to me. Maybe everything just didn't come together for me because in writing this review, I feel like the burger sounds special and promising, but that's not really what I was left feeling.

The service was nice though! Every one was very quick to pick up any trash. The place was very clean even though it was so busy. 

Eh, give it a try for yourself. It is worth a try."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has not disappointed other then the fact that we were seated a really hot room, I guess the air conditioner was not working in their newly added room. The service was great and everything we ordered was great. My girlfriends and I split 4 burgers in 4's so that we could each try a different burger. We shared 2 orders of Ox tail chili cheese fries and onion rings and everything was so good. 

If you are traveling from LA to Vegas I would make it a point to stop by Bachi Burger to eat here, it gets pricey when you taxi it over from the strip so its a must stop before arriving or before departing Vegas."}
{"text":"Burgers do not get any better than this.  From the outstanding service, to the magnificent creations, Bachi burger is one of those rare establishments that will leave you speechless.  I had a customized Wagyu beef burger, and the Salt & Pepper Garlic french fries.  The dessert was fabulous (Portuguese donuts?), along with even the homemade soda beverages.  Bachi has raised the bar on gourmet burger joints, and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Clean. Original. A great job of mixing asian flavors with an American favorite.  Pickled vegetables were delicious  Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"My goodness! I got the Kiki's Burger and it was amazing. The parmesan black truffle fries was so delicious that I ate the whole thing....really. And I ordered the calamansi lime soda to drink...very refreshing. I can't wait for the Summerlin location to open because that's only 5 mins away from my house. 

The service was friendly and all the servers worked together. I did have to wave them away because they wanted to ask questions and all I wanted to do was eat! Wonderful place to eat good and relax."}
{"text":"We came here with relatively high expectations from the great reviews. We ordered the oxtail chili fries and a specialty burger. Let me start with the oxtail chili fries...Not a fan! I hate hate hate hate soggy fries and it didn't help with the hot chili. To be honest, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between oxtail or pulled pork... it could have been pulled pork for all I know. 

I also ordered a burger with very unique flavors on the menu. I probably wouldn't come back. It may have been that my expectations were too high but whatevs."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't even know where to begin, maybe we came on a bad day but absolutely nothing went right. We waited nearly an hour to get full service, another 30 to get our food & when we did, boy were we in for a surprise, we got the black and green burger cooked medium, more like medium rare with a taste of cold & not fully cooked. Ugh it literally made my friend so sick. My daughter's cheeseburger was fully cooked and a little to much if you ask me, completely burnt from the bottom side I had to cut it off for her to eat it, the poor guy tried his best to do what he could on a busy afternoon and he was completely understaffed which explains the waiting time and delays, however the kitchen was fully staffed and we were not the only unhappy customers. I WILL NEVER be back, we got a refund for the awful burger but it still took us a good 15 minutes while the waiter asked his fellow coworker and the cook, TERRIBLE! I hope the owner or manager gets it together & doesn't depend on one person to run a busy shift."}
{"text":"Coming from California, we have a lot of great burger places.  Being a fan of burgers, my sister, her friend and I decided to try out this place.  We're glad we decided to eat at Bachi Burger vs. pigging out at one of the buffets.  Why, you ask?  Because I dare to say (and a friend of mine will agree it is a bold statement) that if there is a Bachi Burger put in Los Angeles, this place will easily knock out my Number One burger spot!

We got the ox tail chili fries and the truffle parmesan sweet potato fries.  Hoo Lee S***!  The truffle sauce and tomato aioli on the sweet potato fries are fantastic, and the chili fries are amazing!  I needed to look for my mama because I needed to slap her; yes it's that good!  And we didn't even get our burgers yet!  The red velvet shake was good, but was not something that stood out (maybe because I was having a food orgasm with the truffle fries!)

The burgers were just as mind blowing.  I got the Miyagi-San burger that has a Wagyu beef patty, onion rings, fried egg, Furikake infused bacon and chili mayo.  Our friend got the Mr. Ho burger, with Angus beef, green onion, cilantro ginger, Hoisin mayo, Lup Cheng, Mizuna and mushrooms... ON A TARO BUN!!!  My sister got the Ronin that has Angus beef with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, Miso Goma dressing,  and Yuzu citrus aioli.

ALL THREE BURGERS WERE FANTASTIC!!!

I almost needed to look for my dad now and slap him too, it's THAT good!!!

I must say we will now be coming to this burger place every time we visit Vegas.  As I finish up writing this review I realize I didnt get to critique the asthetics of the restaurant itself.  WHO CARES!?  If you are reading this and are in the Vegas area, get your rear to Bachi Burger and grab some bomb a** food!!!"}
{"text":"Food 5 Stars
Service 4 Stars
Atmosphere 3 Stars

The food is outstanding. You can tell the Chef really takes notice of the quality and freshness the food by the way the food tastes. I like the limited menu because it's put together well and doesn't get distracted from the fundamental idea \"Gourmet Burgers\". The service is Okay only because its a small business that can't afford to fully staff the dining area when it gets really busy. Be patient with the service because it's a local business and it's impossible to hire enough people to work the rush on a Saturday night. 

All the employees really care about the customer so I'm always willing to overlook a few things for Great food and local businesses. 

Start with a Cheese burger and work your way around the menu over time. It's great food at a decent price."}

My brother doesnt go to crazy bout much. I guess three wonderful yet wild boys does that to a man. Im normally burdened with picking food spots cause im a picky ass... Except for our first dinner in vegas for ces. Koreans have a pecking order where the first son leads in absence of father ergo i didnt object. Plus his selections are good. 

Service: 
Very good

Decor:
Trendy. Bit dark. Dont care to much.

Parking: 
Orale!!!!

Food:
Fries. Nice.

Oxtail chili cheese fries. Bomb!!!! This is the best food in here. Give it a shot :D good size unlike the burgers.

Burger with onion rings inside. This is what my hyungneem ordered. I sampled a bite of the meat. All i tasted was salt. Yuck!!!

Fish sammich. This what i got. The fishy came with ugly green tomatos. The greens were a nice addition!! I asked for sauce on the side and never touched it. I also asked the fish to have zero marination. The grilled fish was great.

Overall i enjoyed this spot mucho. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"They literally make perfect burgers.  Not only that the service was AMAZING!  They explain not only details about each burger with passion but tell you how much each appetizer serves like the Oxtail chili cheese fries (4), this really helps to get you to that perfect level of full and euphoria.  

I had the Spicy Miso Burger, wasn't really spicy but had a little kick here and there complimenting the entire burger.  

Can't wait to come back and tryout every single Burger."}
{"text":"Had to make a stop here before going on the 4 hour journey home. With the accolades of being on the Triple D/Food network, it was a must try!

Gluttony choices:
- Oxtail chili cheese fries with egg (Speechless....is effn delicious too vulgar?)
- Miyagi Waygu Beef Burger: juicy burger, lots of flavor, the cheese and fried onion strips sealed the deal! 
- Pork Belly with Sweet Buns: subtle and simple

There was a slight wait, but I understand since it was small location. Service: was good, just seemed like it was the \"Sunday no one wanted to be there type of vibe\"

If you are in Vegas and tired of the food on the strip and willing to venture off....this is a must try! Highly recommended and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers, Great Service. A bit on the pricier side but clean and modern. Well worth it."}
{"text":"After driving by this place every day for a month or so... I decided it was time to try it. I wasn't sure how 'dressy' the setting was so I wore a sun-dress. This wasn't a mistake by any means but I certainly felt like I could have worn jeans instead. 

Parking seems pretty ample, it was busy and I still got a spot right up front. From the second I walked in the staff was polite and accommodating. Everyone said hello when we walked in, promptly sat us, and helpfully explained their unique menu. The waiter was very energetic and upbeat... which I really like when I'm having a night out. 

To start, we had the Japanese pickles. Let me tell you, if you're a fan of vinegar or simply anything pickled... Get these. They were absolutely AMAZING! Our main meal consisted of the spicy miso burger (which is messy so be sure to ask for extra napkins) and (while the name escapes me currently) a rather amazing burger with home made kimchi. We cut both burgers in half and traded some so we would each enjoy both flavors. We settled on parmesan and sweet potato fries as our sides and we were not disappointed. By the end of the meal there was not one stitch of food left in sight. I even finished my sweet mango milk tea boba. 

The hours of this place are great for any schedule so don't hesitate to drop by after work. If a big dinner or a late night snack isn't your forte, they have plenty of beers to suit all of your needs. While I think it would be convenient if they had a bar area, the tables are just as good a place to 'hang out'. 

I can't think of a single thing about this place that didn't deserve 5 stars. 

Now hurry up! Put on some pants and get a bite."}
{"text":"This spot was a five star cafe last year but...higher prices, smaller portions and some questionable quality in the cesar salad will have me looking at burger spots on the strip next time in Las Vegas,"}
{"text":"Excellent! The Shogun Burger and sweet potato fries are amazing. Bachi is a great spin on a burger joint. Try something different every time and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just walked in, 40 minute wait. Not bad for a Saturday night. Waited about 25 minutes & 2 parties who walked in after me got seated. Went to host to see how many parties before me...my name was crossed off. No biggy, I'm with a large party, didn't make a big stink but just let them know that I've been waiting here & they never called my name. Host apologized & said it'll be no more than 10 minutes. Manager got us seated in 10 minutes & brought us an oxtail chili fries on the house. He put the fire out quick.
Our server, jordan, was awesome. Had recommendations for us & attentive. I ordered the miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger..delicious! Loved the egg, bacon, & onion rings in it. Just the right amount of everything in every bite. I ordered the pork belly steamed buns for the kids & my daughter loved it. We also had dessert...chocolate peanut butter soufflé w/wild berry compote. It was ok, I was expecting more peanut butter flavor but it was made beautifully. 
Check comes & they told us they took off all the gratuity for large parties. Great food and they handled everything quickly. This is how a restaurant should run. Great job, will be back when we're back in town. 

Thank you bachi burger!"}
{"text":"Food: Bahn mi burger, kids burger with milkshake, and Caesar salad. I had trouble deciding between Ronin and Bahn mi, but my server recommended Bahn mi so I ordered that (no pork pate)and it was soooo tasty. It came with fish sauce for dipping and pickled veggies. 

The kids burger came with fries and a milkshake. The burger was huge! My daughter could only eat half. I tasted my hubby's salad. He liked it but I thought it had too much dressing/cheese. 

Service: lunch on a weekday seemed to only have one server, but our service was good. Hostess could have been friendlier/more smiley."}
{"text":"Definitely away from the strip and traffic which is good, but they need a bigger parking lot! My first impression was good, Bachi Burger seemed like an asian infused burger place that knew how to do things right. 

The only problem I had with this place was service.There was a 20 minute wait in which we said bar or table was okay. After 15 minutes in, the hostess calls the table before us and asked if they wanted to do bar. They said no, and so I went up to ask if we could take the bar seating instead since we were next anyways. The lady says, \"sorry, the bar isn't open seating.\" Umm.. what? The first hostess said that if there was available bar seating she would let us know and seat us. So we were like okay.... I guess. We waited another 10 minutes (she seats a big party of 5 in the meantime) and then calls my name and asks if we were okay with bar seating. Seriously? You rejected us 10 minutes ago.. and then you ask us if we wanted it after? What a waste of time and space. It's just been empty sitting there the whole time.. By this time I was super hangry and unhappy at her, so I just stalked to the bar and sat. 
Our guy server at the bar was nice, but was extremely slow. We had to flag down multiple servers and busboys to get our check, and paying for the food was a really long process. For this place being busy all the time, you would think their service should be up to par and they should be running efficiently. But it's not... I would typically minus one for service, but this was at two points (hostess and waitress) where it was lacking...

Anyways on to the food- which was absolutely delicious.
Salt and pepper fries- they were okay, I really wanted the oxtail fries but I don't think the two of us could stomach that and a burger. Will be back to try that next time!
Miyagi-San- grass fed wgayu beef with bacon, fried egg, onion rings, and japanese spice (added cheddar). This burger was absolutely amazing! Everything was done so well, and the meat was delicious and juicy. Yum... 

Will definitely be back to try different burgers and the oxtail fries. Hope their service improves by the time I return..."}
{"text":"Food and service were great.  Unique flavor, the stir fry edamame and Miyagi burger were amazing.  We also ordered the oxtail fries and crab cake burger, they were good but not when compared to the other items ordered at the table, I wouldn't order them again."}
{"text":"2 stars because I wouldn't go back. The price takes it pretty far compared to nearby yard house and islands, but at least those come with fries. For an a la carte menu, i expected the burger to blow me away, but it didn't. I would have rather gone to in n out.  With so many other spots nearby, it wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Not a good experience!  Food was cold and took way to long to be placed on table! The 25 minute wait didn't help either.  Maybe I came at the wrong time, maybe someone quit! Just not a good overall experience! Food was average, nothing spectacular!"}
{"text":"Best Burger in town hands down. Can never get enough of this place. I take everyone who comes in from out of town. Go hungry and get some of the apps as well."}
{"text":"We shared the kiki burger.  The burger was great!  I think the bun is what really makes the burger.  It was soft and yummy.  When I was eating the burger, the bun was like smashed super thin (like a pancake).  I would eat here again and try a different burger.  We had the fries also with the pineapple ketchup- nothing special here.  It was just fries."}
{"text":"Bachi Kitchen serves dishes with immense flavor centering around primarily burgers but they have increased the menu to so much more.  Very convenient location at rainbow and russell that is simply decorated with wood booths and tables.  Must try is the oxtail chili fries as an appetizer.  The iced matcha green tea is very refreshing and goes well with every meal, love unlimited refills btw.  All the burgers are excellently prepared with great flavors making it difficult to try the same one during different trips to Bachi Kitchen.  Personally my favorite is the Kiki's burger with mushrooms, bacon, guyere cheese, veggies and special sauce.  Always cooked to perfection when I order it medium well and the buns aren't typical ones used at other burger joints.  If not in the mood for a burger, I would recommend either of the bun dishes: pork belly or duck."}
{"text":"Had an awesome first experience here!! Dodd was amazing and we ended up getting free fries since they made extra"}
{"text":"Last time I went to Bachi about a week or so ago. I take my kid and my BFF and order my Kiki burger as per usual. And I'm half way through the burger dissatisfied and questioning every bite .... What is this weird taste. I open my burger and notice my plate is yellow and my mushrooms have been soaked in curry.  Now if I go back I wonder if they are just going to hijack my burger and throw in surprises."}
{"text":"Mmmm Bachi burger I was impressed with you. The service was pretty good, decor was plain but nice and the food was also pretty good.The truffle fries and the sweet potato fries will definitely be a problem for my diet but the truffle fries just needed a little more truffles. And the crab cake burger was perfect, the right amount of crab without too much dressing slapped on to take away from the taste. Only complaint is that I just wasn't a fan of the actual burger themselves. Not to say that they're not good, it's just that angus beef wasn't exactly to my liking but others definitely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a weekday evening about 7:30 and was seated immediately. Service was a bit slow from waiting to take our order, waiting for the food, and even waiting for our server to run our bill. It seemed like it was dying down a bit after we got there and picked up when we were leaving. 

I decided to build my own burger. The descriptions of the other burgers sounded overwhelming for my tastebuds and I just wanted something simple since it was my first time here. I ordered a medium wagyu patty with an egg, gruyere cheese, and the onion marmalade with the regular fixings. I got to say, the onion marmalade really exceeded my expectations. I asked for it on the side because I wasn't sure of it yet, but I pretty much smothered it on my burger. 

Would definitely come back again and try their specialty burgers this time."}
{"text":"it's fire fam, just pull up. any wagyu burger is amazing, truffle fries are good as well. can't go wrong w/ pineapple ketchup. my favorite burger place"}
{"text":"Gr8 burgers even if pricey.  My favorite is Kiki's burger w/Kobe beef and mushrooms.  Appetizers are awesome.  Recommend the oxtail Chile fries topped w/an egg.  Service could be better but the ambience, creative Asian fusion menu and beverages make you overlook slowness.  Happy hour deals are good.  Vegi burgers, fish, chicken and pork are also available.  Gr8 buns here and on the burgers.  Desserts are unique too."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Burger and fries I've ever had the pleasure to try.  I ordered the Banh Mi Burger and couldn't even think of one bad thing to say.  The burger was perfectly cooked and super juicy. The herbs and daikon were very fresh and provided a nice crunch. To go with it I ordered the truffle fries, haven't had truffle fries before so I can't really give a good comparison, but these were delicious. 
The Vietnamese Coffee I ordered was a bit light. Too much milk, and they didn't use the normal condensed milk. That's really the only bad thing I could think of with this meal. 

The service was great, it was nice to see that the manager actually rolled up his sleeves and was helping out taking the trash out and wiping tables when it started getting busy. Usually never see that. 

The interior was nice, very clean.  Only thing I could have dealt without was the music, it was very loud for time of day I was there.. Oh yeah, and the hipsters... I could deal without them too but it didn't distract from the amazing meal."}
{"text":"The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries is AWESOME! So much flavor and very filling. My husband and I decided to share a burger because we wanted to try so many appetizers. Nothing was disappointing. The chicken is fried pieces with a dipping sauce (if you are from Hawaii, similar to Mitzuken or Sugoi's). A must try is the the Pork Belly steamed buns. I was craving this on the plane ride home. We had to try the Shogun Burger, a $25.00 burger but it was soooo gooood! It has Foie Gras, Unagi and although that may not sound like it would be good together, it was GREAT!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I wanted to try it because I saw it on a food network tv show. I got my food to go but only because upon entering I saw there were only two tables seated. There was staff who saw me come in the door and they just ignored me. No one acknowledged me for five mins or so and I was about to leave when someone approached me. Im sure it's a great experience if you had time to sit down and go over the menu, grab a few drinks and relax though. 
I got the ban mi burger and regular fries. The fries were amazing with the pineapple ketchup. The burger was very salty and didn't come close to tasting like the flavors in a ban mi sandwich. I would go back and try another time just to try a different burger though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Miyagi-san's burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. All of the flavors worked perfect together. I didn't care to much for the truffle fries though. I also ordered a Strawberry Boba milk tea and that was good as well. It's located near the airport, but if you're visiting Las Vegas without a rental car than the taxi to get here from the strip will be costly."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place but they quickly disappointed us after the food arrived to the table. We ordered two burgers, one medium well and the other medium rare. Unfortunately, there was a long black straight hair in the medium well burger. We made the waitress aware but she had the nerve to ask if it was my hair. Here I am, sitting at the table with big curly hair, disgusted that I might have eaten a piece of the hair intertwined in my meat, and she asks if it's mine. The nerve LOL We won't be back, ever!"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing, the new location is great! Carla was so cheerful, friendly, knows the menu, and gladly obliged all our special requests. If only you could lose the awful house music, it feels like an endless pounding loop..."}
{"text":"Burgers...bomb. oxtail fries...bomb. they even have ramen and guo baos and other stuff since they merged with the ramen place next door which is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Seriously. This place is a must!! The bison burger and truffle fries were phenomenal!!!! Best burger I've had!!! I've never had figs on a burger but I'm totally into it now!!"}
{"text":"The oxtail chili cheese fries are awesome - had to eat first then take pic!

We had seen this place on DD&D and despite sometimes having mixed results when following their recommendations Bachi Burger just looked fantastic.

We shared an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer & they were fantastic - somehow the fries didn't go soggy when smothered in the chili, the addition of a fried egg and cilantro just added to the depth of flavor from the excellent meat/texas style chili.

We then ordered the Kiki and Ronin burgers to share with an order of onion rings.  The burgers were cooked very well (nice and pink in the middle), very juicy and the toppings were fresh.  The buns were good - kind of \"sticky\" like a steamed bun - but the onion rings were the stand out.  They were like tempura onion rings and I highly recommend them.

We also got a side of the pineapple ketchup with was great with the onion rings.

I would for sure head back here to try more of the burgers on the menu and also get an order of those chili cheese fries that i wouldn't share!"}
{"text":"A very special burger! !!  Maybe not for all occasions or cravings. I love it!  However the bun is too soft and too sweet to make the Burger totally awesome..."}
{"text":"We had our reunion just this past week and this was one of the places that I was soooo curious about by reading all the praises about it..  When we stepped through the door of windmill address restaurant, I was already impressed with whole ambiance of the place..  Not your typical burger place that's for sure..  After taking a look at the menu, I was floored by the concepts of all the food!  Even the alcoholic drinks were intriguing!!  After constant deliberations..  I decided on the Miyagi-San burden and to share some oxtail chili fries...  The fries was simply awesome!!!!  Best fries in the world for at least a few minutes..  Till the Truffle Parmesan fries landed..  We have a new champion!!!  Unreal!!!  I was thinking someone needs to open one of these back home in Hawaii!!  The burgers had then came out and it was perfect..  Thick and juicy burgers!!  I was content!!  By far..  The best burger place I ever went to EVER!!"}
{"text":"Love Bachi Burger at Russell and Rainbow but NOT this location.  The fries in the 'Oxtail Fries' were raw.  Sent them back, but it was a huge disappointment.  The pork belly bao buns lacked flavor and they were served without sauce and were all fatty and lacked meat on them. These are 100 times better at the Russell/Rainbow restaurant.  Went home and got sick after the meal.  Will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"The food was good but it was pricey for a non-celebrity burger joint located way outside the strip. Just because the place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives doesn't mean I should pay $12-18 for a burger ala carte plus an extra $4-5 for fries. The kids menu items were a bit pricey too ($11) but those included sides at least. There are 3 locations for this place but the competition is either Five Guys or Fatburger, etc. It's not a celebrity burger joint like Bobby's Burger Palace or Gordon Ramsay's BurGR so please do not charge prices like these places unless you're actually in a hotel/casino on the strip. It wouldn't have been so bad if you'd include a side of fries with those burgers. I think The Cheesecake Factory has better prices on their Glamburgers."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmark for a very long time! So when my friend told me she wanted to try out this place... we knew we has to add it into our places to go for her bday in vegas. 

We ended up making the drive out which wasn't too far from our hotel. We got seated pretty fast and was ready to order. 

My friend ordered oxtail chili cheese fries and i got the parmesan fries with miyagi burger. We also share the pork belly steamed buns. 

My burger was delicious! One of the best burger I ever had. I think its was the freshness of the ingredients and the bun they use that make this burger out of this world. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness but the fries was just okay. 

Overall... great place to check out if you're cravings for a burger!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a delicious burger here. Bachi's prices are a little higher than a normal burger joint, but the quality is far superior. They have a bunch of delicious and unique burgers to choose from on their menu."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Do not judge the book by its cover. Looking from the outside you'd never know this place has the best food. Food presentation has a fine dining touch, kicking it up a notch. We had pork belly buns appetizer, the burger, cornbeef loco moco, hawaiian omelette, truffle fries, brussel sproats, strawberry bread pudding dessert. Everything delicious. I would definitely eat here again.?Highly recommended. We are from Hawaii. Aloha! Great job!!"}
{"text":"I think the most important feature of a burger place is the burger.  The burger I had here, the ronin, was phenomenal!  I ordered mine medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side, excellent!  Everything about the burger was tasty.  Unfortunately, I can't say the say about the side of truffle parmesan fries that I ordered as well.  The fries were somewhat bland, and the sauce on top looked as though some one dropped a Cleveland steamer on them.  The Thai iced tea was also a big \"meh.\" My recommendation, stick with the burger and you shall go home happy."}
{"text":"*military discount*

Went 9-6-15 around 12:30 PM.  Once we were seated I realized that Shoku Ramen and Bachi Burger are in the same restaurant whaaaaaat??? I almost lost it.  I was so torn...do I get a burger or ramen??? 

$39.40 got me the pork belly bao buns, a wagyu burger with an egg on it, a jasmine milk tea with boba, and a kale salad.  

This was my first experience with wagyu...I felt pretty fancy eating my hoity-toity burger.  I dunno if it was worth the price tag but it was pretty good.  I kept getting huge pieces of peppercorn and having to spit them out...maybe other people like that but I didn't. 

The pork belly buns....while pretty tasty I don't think they are worth eleven bucks.  Maybe if they were five bucks.  Hipsters will eat anything with pork belly in it.    

Next time I'm going to try the ox tail fries and some ramen!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty small and intimate which is not my thing personally but I can see how it would add to the ambiance. I.. I would order every burger and eat it at once if I had the stomach for it, that's how good they are at blending flavors in their dishes. I have never been disappointed in an order dining here. Wish they catered, do they cater? If they don't they should consider it."}
{"text":"Yuck!!!! Yuck .   The worst we have had in a very long time all our burgers were wrong.   It was like we got some one else's order.    Everything was terrible.  When I said something about the food quality the the thing the person on the phone said was you get what you pay for, how rude and impolite"}
{"text":"I have a confession to make....

I ended up here because of Guy Fieri...

I think that automatically makes me a douchebag and I ask your forgiveness.

Finished off our quick 2 days in vegas with a trip to Bachi burger before driving back to my beloved city of angels.  45 minute wait on a Friday afternoon...could have been worse.  In terms of service...they must have been having a bad day...because it was gawdawful...I was mildly annoyed when I saw other diners getting ALL of their food even though we were seated before them..and we sat there with nothing...the wife was furious..staff was semi apologetic at least.  Anywho, on to the food.

OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg

Quite simply amazing.  These are 5 star chili cheese fries...ridiculously over the top oxtail chili topped with cheese, jalapenos, cilantro and chopped scallions, garlic aioli and a fried egg.  Delicious Insanity.

Caramelized Bacon Crispy Onion Rings...I made the wife uncomfortable with the moans of pleasure emanating from my food hole.

{"text":"The best way to put it - I literally created a Yelp account just so I could share with the world how good the burgers are here. They are amazing.

The waitresses are always very nice and friendly. You can't go wrong!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Ate there once with my boyfriend and some friends and just had terrible service. The food was good but our waitress sucked. Unfortunately because of how bAd the service was me and my boyfriend haven't gone back."}
{"text":"Friendly servers and delicious food. It's a foodie's dream come true. 

The oxtail chili cheese fries (adding a sunny side up egg) is to die for !"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance was absolutely delicious. Apparently Bachi burger merged with ramen next door. The Ramen was one of the best I have ever had. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a quaint and awesome place. Wait staff are very friendly and attentive. Our group ordered different items and shared. Their food is unique, flavorful,and delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh Bachi on Russell, I'm worried about you! We live very close to this location, and although a bit pricy, it's one of my very favorite spots because of the food!!! Their burgers can't be beat, period. Last night I tried the no meet burger and then regretted my choice, thinking there was no way it would be up to par. It was PHENOMENAL. So good that I'd even chose it over some of the meat burgers. I've never, ever had that much flavor in a veggie burger. Best I've ever had BY FAR. And their cod burger... I seriously crave it.

We LOVE all of their fries too, but last night outs were very soggy and undercooked for the first time ever. Bummer. 

Now let me share why I'm updating with a lower rating. The service here is embarrassing. It's never been great... They always seem to be understaffed. But again... The FOOD! However, it's getting worse.it wasn't busy at all last night... Maybe 3-4 tables, and 3 servers (one was also tending bar on and off), and no hostess. I haven't seen a hostess in here for ages, and they need one!

Since it was quiet, we were seated fairly quickly. Then it took forever to get a seat. Then it took forever to get a server. Once we got a server, he took our drink order, and disappeared for a while. We then had our order taken. One minute later, another waiter came up and asked if he could get us started with our drink orders. With only three tables full, there shouldn't be any confusion. To add to that confusion though, 5 minutes after our order was taken, food was served. However, it wasn't our food, and it wasn't our waiter. Oops!

As we were eating, we saw about four other parties come in. There were only two tables full at this point, and we watched these people sit and wait for a table in a nearly empty restaurant for at least 10 minutes. There really is no excuse for that. One party just finally seated themselves, one or two left, and the other finally got seated. It was embarrassing to watch.

Another issue last night. We ordered the kale salad. On the menu, it states that it comes with pine nuts. When ours arrived, it had walnuts. I'm allergic to walnuts, and luckily saw them before I took a bite. I understand not having ingredients, but it's not okay to sub other ingredients without letting customers know. Especially with nuts, because they are well known allergens. They took the salad back and made us a new one, and apologized twice, which was nice. 

And lastly, please, PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, bring back the pickled veggie appetizer!!! It was the most unique, flavor exploding dish on the menu. We were told that you can only get it at the other location now.

Bachi, we love you. We know you can turn this around. But you've got to work on it, and quickly before you lose more customers."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger brings together my two favorite things - Asian Flavorings and Burgers. I can't pin-point which one is my favorite because they are all different (lies, its the Miyagi Sans burger but, I didn't want to hurt the others feelings). All I can say is that when you add an egg to a burger, it intensifies the flavors of the burger with the burst of the egg yolk. ::drools:::
I can't say I am a fan of the oxtail fries OR the truffle fries but, the burger is enough to fill you up and doesn't really need extras as its the STAR of the show. 

Try the vietnamese coffee to finish your meal but, order it half way through your burger, as it takes a bit to brew. A nice mix of condensed milk and flavorful coffee."}
{"text":"This bad boy is one of a kind! Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach. I've never had a burger with these creative elements. Absolutely delicious and unique. I wanted to also try the oxtail garlic fries but the order is probably best for at least two people. A bit off the strip, but take an Uber as the Shotgun Burger is worth it."}
{"text":"So I have to admit that lately Guy Fieri has been letting me down with some of his recommendations, and particularly his Vegas restaurant at The Quad. However, this was my second visit to Bachi Burger, and this place still rocks. We were three ravenous hikers fresh off a three hour drive back from Zion, still coming down from the adrenaline high of hiking Angel's Landing. So naturally we stuffed our faces with the truffle fries (fantastic), kiki burger (amazing), spicy miso burger (good), peking duck steamed buns (good but covered in cilantro which I HATE), and I topped all that off with a chocolate peanut butter milkshake (good... but definitely overkill at that point). The Asian fusion is right on point, and the burgers are clearly made with high quality ingredients with a lot of thought going into the various flavor combinations.

My only complaint is that the bathrooms were not very clean and they made us wait for a table at 3 PM on a Sunday, even though the restaurant seemed pretty empty. Also the parking lot (where you have to wait for your table) smells horrendous because there is a dumpster full of rotting fish from the sushi restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for the weekend and couldn't leave without trying a Triple D joint. I went with Bachi Burger and was not disappointed. I ordered the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries and the Port Belly Buns. Both were full of flavor - absolutely delicious. 

Couldn't have spend a cheat day any other way!"}
{"text":"Don't go there. Service is bad and slow, you have to ask several times to get anything. Asked to get a napkin and they completely forget about it. Wouldn't be a big deal but I had to do this for several things - very unpleasant. Very unorganized and understaffed. Burger was cold with little meat and a big bun. Considering that this was a $15 burger I should have gone to McDonald ... at least it's cheaper, service is better and food is even better. Last time I went to this place."}
{"text":"I think the food is pretty good, and reasonably priced at $10 per burger.  Unfortunately the service here sucks beyond belief!!!

Truffle Parmesean fries - below average  - I would've given this an average rating but I couldn't taste the truffle at all.  The dipping sauce it comes w/ is delicious tho.

Oxtail Chili Cheese fries w/ fried egg - below average - The chili was waaaaaaaay too sweet.  I couldn't put my finger on it but I've never tasted sweet chili before.  Wasn't a big fan.  The presentation of this dish is beautiful but it didn't live up to the hype.

Miyagi San Grass Wagyu Fed Burger ($10) - Slightly above average.  The shrimp tempura inside the burger was a nice touch, & gave it a nice crunchy feel.   They over-cooked my burger tho.  I ordered medium rare and it came out medium; almost felt like I was eating an in-n-out burger or something.

Kiki Burger ($10) -above average.  I dug the garlic, onions, bacon, & mushrooms.  It's a solid burger.  Basic, but solid.

Tips:
-Service sucks beyond belief.  
   -They had our table set up but didn't seat us till 10 minutes after the table was ready.
   -Food took about 30-40 minutes to come out after placing the order
   -I ordered some extra sides of sauce and they never brought it

-Food is gonna be messy.  I tried the Miso burger (also pretty good) and there were piles of sauce everywhere; this isn't an insult to the dish mind you, the burger itself was still pretty good.

The food is good and prices are pretty cheap, offset by horrible service.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Fish burger and sweet potato fries rockin the taste buds. Very well thought out and flavors galore in the fish burger. My server recommended the black and blue next time. She said they grind their own meat everyday. I'll leave that alone for now. Highly recommended by this yelper."}
{"text":"My first time today because two of my friends wanted to go here and I thought, why not?

I tried the Kiki burger because of a tip/review on here and it's definitely good. It was better than I thought since I'm not usually the type to eat burgers.

I don't know about the price, though the burgers are really good.

It's in Village Square and I don't usually come around this side of town so who knows when I'll be back.

Definitely was a good first time :)."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, it was still their vegetarian place. Now it's just bachi burger. 

As always, the Kiki burger ceases to disappoint. Always so delicious. Fries would also be a yummy addition but seeing as I usually don't finish my burger, I forego it. Coincidentally, this last visit I finished the entirety of my burger. Either it's gotten more delish than usual or I was actually that hungry. 

Service great. As expected. 

Place is decently sized, just enough."}
{"text":"My first impression was whoa! From the green tea to the fries to the strangely seasoned burgers everything was fantastic and prepared with care. The staff was incredibly nice. Everything about Bachi Burger was perfect a lunch after having too much to drink.

This location is right next to a movie theater and will be dead one minute and insanely crowded the next when a movie lets out. Not that you can easily plan to avoid the crowds, just be warned."}
{"text":"Wow Finally a place that lives up to the hype!! A solid find! step in to a funky little urban joint... right away it was comfortable. good solid service, I got there just before the lunch rush and ordered the \"No Meat Here Burger\" it was so good, only... like all the new \"trendy\" places fries do not come with... Arrrgh, hate that trend!!! Ordered \"just fries\" they were delicious with a hint of sea salt, I didn't care too much for the pineapple ketchup... but, nothing a little sriracha couldn't fix Oh yea that's what it needed, So my first visit went well, now I'm a big fan... So I'll be back and I hope you will too, The menu has alot more goodies to try..."}
{"text":"Burger was great and the Pork belly buns had perfect flavor. Dogfish Head beer also helps with the stars."}
{"text":"Several of my friends come here often and always checked in on facebook so I decided to give it a try. Their burger was pretty good and we got this pickled combination dish, man, who would have though pickled garlic can be this good!? LOL.

But anyways, it's definitely a place where I will go back to :)."}
{"text":"When I first tried Bachi Burger I was not impressed, luckily I gave it another try. My team at work decided to get together and eat here one night. They were super accommodating, considering we took up almost the entire restaurant on a busy Friday night. I had the Kiki burger and was very happy with the flavor. I mean mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere, and garlic aioli - how can you go wrong? My husband and I split an order of the truffle fries and I was really sad I had to share. The fries are slim cut and delicious. I really enjoyed the sun dried tomato aioli that came on the side, in fact I found myself slathering some on my burger. My husband had the fish sandwich and it had really great flavor. The fish was not deep fried, but pan seared which was unique and the glaze on the fish made it really tasty. 

My only gripe is the wait time, since the place is so small. We recently visited and they had remodeled and made more seating. They even installed a bar/counter area to help seat smaller parties. I really like the new look and hope it cuts down on the wait time, either way the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Over the last few years these guys have really dropped in food quality , customer service and cleanliness .  Service is slow , restrooms dirty , and food is mediocre . over priced now... and not worth the time or money .. ramen was bland and burgers were just ok."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with anything on this menu and the only mistake you'll make is ordering too much.  The burgers are huge.  All portions are huge.  

The strip mall locale is awesome.  Parking is easy.  Expect to wait but don't get itchy.  The wait is worth it.  

Whatever you do, do not overlook the oxtail chili fries and don't order it expecting it to be an appetizer.  It's massive, heavy, full flavored, spicy, amazing.  This is a meal for two on its own.  So don't get a burger and the oxtail chili fries.  You can't eat it all.  So sit back and enjoy!   

I went twice on the same trip, you have to have a rental if you're a tourist.  Cabs are expensive.  So rent a car and drive out here from whatever strip casino you are staying at.  It's so worth it."}
{"text":"Unlike certain other ostensibly fusion burger places (cough cough Fuku Burger), Bachi Burger actually has some interesting dishes with less commonly found combinations. I had the spicy miso burger, which I enjoyed. It's reasonably priced, too. Service was friendly though a bit slow. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Don't bother.... Heard good things about the burgers and sides and decided to go out for dinner with friends and their 4 year old. We were seated right away and brought water by the server who said he would be taking care of us and promptly walked away without missing a beat. A few minutes later he comes back to get our beverage order- we attempted to order for the kiddo, but he already walked away again... The sodas come and we order a beer and again try to order for the kiddo and same as before- gone within a blink of the eye.... About 7 minutes go by- no beer, no server and a handful of other patrons looking around to see if anyone was coming back to perhaps take a dinner order for anyone. Please keep in mind this is a Wednesday evening around 545 and there were only 6 tables in the place total. I can't comment on the actual food, but I do know if you can't even get an order in, it's probably not worth waiting around to see."}
{"text":"I've been here before and had the Shogun burger and Oxtail chili cheese fries. I Remember both being so incredibly AWESOME I had to come back, so we did.
My wife and myself weren't all that terribly hungry, but it was kind of a \"to do\" list on the way back from Vegas.

We walk in at about 10pm on a Thursday night. It's slow and there's a lot of staff on hand. We get seated by a guy who seems entirely indifferent about his job and just life in general. You may be wondering how I know this about a simple 
host /  hostess???? Because he was our waiter also. There were TOO many people working and only two other tables seated to get bad service. Not that bad service is ever excusable, but there are times when you understand to some degree. 

Like I said, we weren't that hungry so we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and a side salad; which sounded decent in the description. Micro greens, some kind of walnuts, avocado, and an orange vinaigrette. 

The fries come out first and the first thing I notice was the fries to chili ratio. Way off. Too much fries and not enough chili. Not a big deal cause there's no way we're finishing them. We start to dig in and holy crap is there a TON of salt on there. Enough salt to start my own mine if i was feeling  entrepreneur-ish. We didn't complain because fries don't save well and we were already full.

The house salad then comes out. Being a MAN, I feel a certain sense of obligation to conquer this small salad, even though i already feel like a glutton (first world problems, I know). So I take a bite.....  GOD DAMN!!!! Did a salt grenade go off in the back or something? Not only were the fries too salty, but the salad? Maybe someone in the back just discovered how great salt can be and was of the mindset \"more is obviously better\"? Enough about salt. The orange  vinaigrette was good. The avocado was pretty much non existent (two small chunks), but the walnuts were delicious.

Maybe my memory deceives me, but i could have sworn I LOVED this place when I came about a year ago. Bachi has a unique twist on the whole burger thing, but that twist isn't good enough to keep me coming back"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place! The servers are very nice and they have a great sense of humor, furthermore, the burgers are so excellent! I recommend this place to everyone who are looking to dine at a great burger restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't want to talk about it! It'll make me hungry and want to drive to Las Vegas NOW! I'm MAD! why no BACHI Burger in LOS ANGELES! REALLY.  

Here you go...GET THE Oxtail fries...and ask the waiter about the burgers featured on the food network show.  Then chose from there. You CAN'T GO WRONG! mmmmmmm yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"}
{"text":"For some reason, I bookmarked this place without actually reading about it.  I actually thought it was a fast food-ish restaurant.  HAH.  Wrong.  It's a pretty nice sit down restaurant!

Ordered:

Husband tried the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings.  The $13 is quite attractive and definitely the way to go if you want the wagyu beef.  A regular wagyu burger starts at $16.  Husband LOVED it!

I ordered the plain BBQ Bachi Burger Angus Beef with Cheddar Cheese.  Thrilling, I know.  I'm such a risk taker.  It was very good and however they cook these burgers is incredible.  It had a slight crispness on the outside, but still juicy on the inside (even ordered well done!).  The bun was perfectly soft, but not too much so that it dissolved around the burger.

Sweet potato fries were really good.  Perfectly cooked, not underdone or overdone.  I was really bummed they don't have ranch.  I mean, what else do you dip your sweet potato fries in?!  I didn't like the accompanying Yuzu Citrus Aioli, so I asked to try the Garlic Chili Aioli, which they charged us 50 cents for.  I hate being nickel and dimed for things like that, especially when I ended up not liking it.  Oh well.

Overall, I'd say my rating would probably be a 3 and the husband would give it 4-5, so I'll round up because I think not liking their creative sauces is a personal problem.  Definitely not a bad place to stop on your way into Vegas, or if you want to get off-strip for a bit while you're in town."}
{"text":"It's quite a drive from the Vegas strip, but it's worth it! The oxtail chili fries was delicious!! I sampled 3 different burgers (including the mizumi) and were all unqiue with different flavors and compliment. The patty was juicy and the bun was lightly toasted. One of my fav burger joint!"}
{"text":"After coming from a different restaurant where my experience was just not good at all, I didn't even eat there as I was expecting a foie gras and this place had it thankfully! And it's really good, the shogun burger!! Wagyu with unagi and pan seared foie gras! Mmmm! So happy I ordered one to go! And the service is just as great too!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers without the headache of the strip.  If you want a seriously tasty burger, some horribly delicious fries, and a good drink to wash it all down this is the spot.

I've been here a few times based on recommendations from a friend and it's becoming a go to place while in town, but better have a car as it's a pretty pricy ride from the strip which suits me just fine, so this gem doesn't get covered in weekenders and convention goers. 

I had the spicy miso burger which was a no brainer with my love for shishito peppers.  The burger is delicious with a nice soft bun and packed full of flavor.  Along with it we had oxtail chili fries which were delicious with good thin fries that weren't over cooked or soggy - perfect crunch!"}
{"text":"I can't put my finger on it, but for some reason, I don't like this location as much as the other two.  It has something to do with the atmosphere.  The burger and fries tasted the same...very good. One great thing is that it wasn't nearly as busy as the original location, so it had immediate seating."}
{"text":"We ALWAYS take our visiting friends here, without fail. Asian fusion burgers never tasted better. I love their taro bun burger as well as the banh mi burger. My husband's go-to order is kiki's burger. Since we've started going there about a year ago, they've added a multitude of appetizers and desserts, probably due to the hours extension and additional bar. For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner. 

We've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!"}
{"text":"Once again, the upwardly mobile citizens of Las Vegas who have moved out of their trailer parks and into tract homes have sold me down the river.

First of all, the music (like so many restaurants in this town) is so loud that you can't have a conversation with the company at your table.  Is this to cover up the Mexican families 5 little brats screaming or the weathered strippers puffed up boyfriend seated next to your table's homophobic rant about how 'he crushed that little f**'' ?
Anyways the service is very poor from the tattooed waitress I had.  Certainly no training or even effort involved.  Bad attitude, although it did make me feel like I was back home in Portland.

She plopped down my undercooked $13 burger with no fries and left, never to be seen again until she plopped down my bill.

No thanks Bachi. I will never be back."}
{"text":"This May be my shortest review ever, but these may be some of the best burgers I have ever had. I want to go back to Vegas just to get some more burgers. drool....."}
{"text":"*Thumbs up*
I reviewed the newer location, but this original restaurant also deserves one. This time I tried the banh mi burger and it was frickin' delicious. Tons of flavor popping through -- took the banh mi flavors and packed it in a juicy, meaty burger. Can't wait to try another different burger on the menu.

*Thumbs down*
The onion rings were a soggy and greasy disappointment. I will definitely be skipping on those in future visits. Stick to the burgers."}
{"text":"I returned to eat at this location for the second time in as many weeks (yeah I know, I'm crazy). Here are the other items I tried:

Chili fried chicken - a bit disappointing, as the chicken was a bit soggy and not crispy. Good flavor, though.

Ronin burger - this was the burger I ordered for myself, and I liked it a lot. The smooth and silky caramelized onions was a nice contrast to the bright and crisp cole slaw and miso goma dressing. The runny fried egg just put it over the top. 

I personally still prefer the richness and extra \"beefy\" and robust flavor from Miyagi san's Wagyu burger. Plus, I just love those damn onions rings.

Spicy miso burger - overall, great flavors from roasted garlic and the shishito pepper mayo, but the burger was not spicy at all. I say if you're going to put the word \"spicy\" in the burger, at least put some kick into it! 

Bachi fish burger - the pan seared alaskan cod was super moist, flaky, and full of flavor. This fish burger is the KING SUMO of all fish burgers, and would crush (literally) all other fish burgers of the world."}
{"text":"Ba-Zing!! Thing place is amazing. Great food and service! I love the kalbi burger! Kalbi beef with kimchi mmm!!  The burgers are so big you almost need 3 hands to hold it."}
{"text":"Love this burger joint!
Yes, it is a bit expensive for a burger but the quality and taste out weigh the premium!
A wide selection of fun, fusioned burgers!
I love the truffle parmesan fries, they complement the burger so well.
Will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat burgers. Now being vegetarian puts me in a bind at most places but bachi burger has an awesome grilled bachi fish burger!!! Add sweet potato fries and your in heaven. Wait I can't forget to talk about the BUNS.....to DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"So we wanted to stop by this place before he headed out to EDC... and  was seriously about to pass out at EDC. Everything was so good and I just kept eating and eating....

I went with about 6 people and so we could split and try the different appetizers that they had...

- Truffle Parmesan Fries - pretty good w/ the sun dried tomato aioli sauce
- Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries - I must say, this is one of my favorite appetizers... so simple, yet so delcious and addicting
- Chili Fried Chicken... not bad, but i probably would not order it again 
- Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries w/ Garlic Aioli and Egg - Pretty popular and it's on a couple of tv shows... and i must say... it does not disappoint. If you don't share this with more than 3 people... you're prob gonna be a bit stuffed by the time you get to the main courses!

- On to the burgers!

- Manga Burger - crab and scallop dyanmite on a 7 oz. Angus Beef , kainare sprouts w/ a sunny side up egg and a side of ginger.... not a bad burger! pretty good, but I felt maybe the crab cake portion was a bit dry. 
- Shogun Burger - Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach.... 26 dolllars for this... but damn.. every bite was worth it... would defintely order this again!!!

Overall, I would definitely come back again and try the other burgers. Probably the best burgers I've had in vegas to date."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place I've ever  been to by far !! The fries we're delicious along with the coffee milkshake !!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner the other night looking for something on a cheat day. 

Environment: Good decorations, not too noisy, and tables are a little close together, but spread out enough.  

Service: Our waiter did the bare minimum. He came when he was supposed to expect when we needed our check. Had to flag him a few times. In the end our busser was the one we saw more, and requested our check from. 

Food: We had the Parmesan truffle fries to share. I really enjoyed those! They were the perfect crisp and seasoned very well. The sauce with them was yummy as well. Perfect sharing size. 
I had the Kiki burger. It was tasty, but I felt a little bland at times. When I read the ingredients, I thought it would be a lot more flavorful than it was. A little disappointing, but still a good burger.  Same thing for my fiance's burger. He has the blue cheese one. 

Overall: Decent fusion burger place. It was good, but we are not dying to go back. 

Our total bill for two burgers, fries to share, and a coke was about $40 before tip."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers!! They are Fresh & Delicious! Def worth every penny. I will be coming back =]"}
{"text":"Got the Ox tail chili fries. Very good.I think this is the best thing I have tried so far.
The chili is really nice,with the thinly sliced jalapeño.

Tried the Miyagi san for the first time. I prefer the Kiki.
As usual burger a bit on the heavy side.(miyahgi) But next time I may just try a plain bachi burger. The meat is so good it doesn't need all the sauces and stuff.
Also to try: The turkey burger, because I rarely eat red meat.

Onion rings were a little greasy."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and vibe. Had better burger with fried egg else where."}
{"text":"Very slow on a Sunday afternoon.  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
Service was a little slow since there were 2 servers and only 5 tables seated. It could have been the time of day, 3pm. Staff maybe getting ready for the dinner crowd? I won't ding them for this because we were not in a hurry.
I ordered the 7 oz Angus Burger. The burger is good, Angus is my favorite beef and the portion is just right. I dislike giant burgers that leave me stuffed and wanting a nap. 
My wife had Kiki's Burger. It was obvious she was very pleased with her choice since she did not offer to let my try nor leave any on the plate for my to sample when she was done.
We split an order of Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries. The fries were very good, I always put pepper on my potatoes and you can never go wrong with garlic.
If we get the opportunity we will go back.  Maybe try the Windmill Ln location."}
{"text":"This was the best way to end my weekend in Vegas.

I wanted something new and different and so my friends recommended this place and by the Gods of Olympus was this place absolutely amazing.

The place was about 10 minutes from the strip, but for those going back to Cali through the 15, this is the perfect pit stop before going home. The place had a wait, but we got seated rather quickly. The inside was very modern with a nice bar and good selection of beers.

Anyways I split the Ox Tail Fries with my friend and ho' man was this goooooood! It was shoe string fries covered in chili cheese, tender ox tail, and one yolky egg. To absolutely die for. It is definitely big enough to feed three people so we were full after devouring it. 

At the same time I got a Ronin Burger medium rare. The bun was crispy and the meat was juicy. It also had an egg and some sweet sides that I wish I remembered right now.

Customer service was great. They refilled our drinks all the time, took our trash, and was around enough to make sure everything was fine. Definitely deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow what a place! I will say off the bat I almost didnt come here because the company website SUCKS!I. it never works the links are bad.
I dont eat red meat and I was afraid based on what I saw of the website I couldnt find anything on any other offerings, but when we got there I was happy to see an expansive menu to accomodate every one

BUT, back to the food... It's a tradition of ours to try calamari ( 9.50) anywhere we go and I will say it was good, a little oily for my taste but otherwise cooked beautifully and included tentacle pieces which is a must so points for including ! The burgers were beautiful and deliciously juicy everyone at the table was giddy at their yummy juicy burgers

 I had high hopes for the truffle parmesean fries and I was so disapointed they were underseasoned and eventhough they had a bunch of stuff on them it was just a flat flavor profile. A suggestion if you get any of their speciality burgers don't add or take away anything including any sauces that come with and I say that because each burger are handcrafted and intended to have all the flavor components work together and if you don't you will miss out, so live outside the bun you won't be disappointed. The staff were impeccable, they were attentive without being annoying and answered any questions we had since this was our first trip. We will be back"}
{"text":"I've been to Bachi Burger a handful of times and have never been disappointed by the food. The burgers are amazing! The only reason I am not giving five stars is that the service is just mediocre....very slow, unenthusastic waitstaff. I went on my lunchbreak with some coworkers and it took at least 40 min to get our food...even though we told them upfront we needed to be in and out."}
{"text":"I must have been unsensibly hangry when I reviewed Bachi last time. Yes the service is hit or miss, but the burgers and fries.... amazing. 

I've tried a few of the burgers, but I never stray too far from the Myagi-San. We have an off-and-on relationship, and we like it. The ox tail fries are delicious, but warning for those sensitive to spice -- ask for a few less jalapenos! 

The wait can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes, but the burgers are so juicy and delicious, I think it's worth it. Maybe just don't come with me when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"For some reason, all the threads in YT about burgers made me feel like having one. So I decided to head back to Bachi Burger and eat inside the restaurant. In my last review I had the Ronin burger which was very good. This time I went with the Kiki burger, which has applewood smoked bacon, 3 different mushrooms, guyere cheese and chili aoili mayo. $12. I also ordered a Mocha Almond Fudge milkshake.

The restaurant was less than half full on a Friday night at 8pm. I arrived expecting to have to wait a bit, but was warmly greeted by the cute hostess and seated immediately. My waiter came over after about 8 minutes and took my order, and my food was out within 10 minutes. Pretty quick. 

OK, why only 3 stars this time? Well, it would be 3.5 because the burger was pretty good, although the flavor of the bacon seemed lost inside. But what really bothers me is paying $6 for a milkshake, and getting it served in a small 10 oz or maybe 12 oz glass, with a lot of whipped cream on top. Really? Take notes restaurant owners and managers. A good milkshake that you are making me pay a small fortune for should always be served in a 16 oz glass, with the remaining shake served in the silver cup it was made in. This is not an option. Milkshake lovers like myself will thank you, and if you don't serve it this way, I will never visit your establishment again no matter how good the food is. Rant over."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger i ever had.  the Miyagi-san burger was amazing.  i need to go back there again soon."}
{"text":"Finally, I made it to Bachi Burger. Burgers ordered were the Spicy Miso and Robin Burgers. I must say these burgers are magical. They tantalize the taste buds and magically disppear leaving behind a satisfying grin from ear to ear. The combination of ingredients not only boggles the mind but mistifies the thought that any other burger could compare. My Spicy Miso Burger had just right amount of spice and at the suggestion of my server opted for grilled onion to top it off, what a treat. I'd eat here everday if not for spending $42 for burgers and some edamame keeps me from doing so. Five stars all day."}
{"text":"What's better than burgers? Asian-infused BURGERS!

I love the fact that there's no waiting whenever I go here (I go around 8 o'clock). I'm usually seated right away which is already a good sign. We ordered the truffle parmesan fries with a special sauce that was to die for. I love the texture of the fries - not too crunchy, but not soggy.

I ordered a Kiki's burger last time I was here, so decided I wanted to try something new. Me and my boyfriend got the Miyagi burger and let me tell you it deserves a black belt. I love the fried onions with bacon and fried egg. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate, haha. It reminded me of a more sophisticated Tamago burger (from Fuku). 

I love this place and my boyfriend does too so we will definitely be back. We still have tons of burgers and entrees to try!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't good.. Messed up our order Three times. Staff would argue about the mistakes in front of us. Then we asked to have an item taken off our bill that we didn't order. And the manager came to us with an attitude. We paid left and still tipped but this review is being left behind."}
{"text":"If you want a unique burger this is the place. 

The atmosphere of this restaurant is large and nicely designed. The staff is very prompt. 

Aside from the burgers they have some interesting side dishes and deserts. 

Overall this is great place for lunch or dinner. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"BEST truffle fries and chipotle dipping sauce. They are a MUST get. My boyfriend and I split a teriyaki burger and their meat was AMAZING!!! Really kicked back environment, and I would definitely go again. :)"}
{"text":"love this place! im not a burger fan... but i always crave bachi burger!

love the gourmet fries... sweet potato, or truffle parm fries.

i've had a few burgers here... kiki burger... and the ronin burger are the most popular.
i think i liked the kiki burger more.

when i want to spend $30 on a burger, im going to try the foie gras & kobe beef burger.

i also want to try the banh mi burger.

the staff is very helpful too with helping you pick your first burger if you've never been before.

highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Asian twist..must try! Not for the picky regular Joe! Definitely have to think out side of the box and expand your taste buds, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but it was the service that ruined it for me. 
 The oxtail chili and fries ratio was 1 to 4. The binding to my no meat burger patty was nonexistent; it crumbled each time I took a bite. Calamari had good flavor combination, but the portion was smaller than a past visit. Only thing I liked there were the plain fries and Plantain iced tea.
   15min in after ordering and the people who came after us got their entrees before we got our appetizers. The dishes they gave us were still stained, I had to ask for replacement. Even then, we still wiped the plates with napkins, just to be sure. The people who left after we arrived, their dirty dishes stayed there till right before we got our entrees. And there were only 3 tables filled, even then they weren't attentive. I don't get the hype, especially for the price. 
  If my experience in a place is bad, no food can ever make up for it. No thank you."}
{"text":"I got the Kiki burger and it was OKAY, but nothing that I'd imagine got, like 800 reviews. 

I asked for medium rare, more on the rare side - came out medium. The bun was thick and didn't compliment or add to the taste of the burger at all. The carmelized bacon was good, but I couldn't taste it much on the burger, unfortunately. I wanted it to be awesome, but was a little disappointed.

That said, the service was good and I do wish I could give them 3.5. Maybe I'm being too harsh and they deserve 4? It's just hard when I read the reviews and expected them to be like Bareburger in NYC, and they were not, even though their prices are laid out the same way and they don't have fries come with their burgers.

I'll have to go back and try something people recommended on here so I can make a bit of a better assessment. But for now, this is what I have to say."}
{"text":"So when you walk in to a new restaurant after the Yelp cycle has been kicked up and there are so many 5 star reviews from random people or even some friends you have this level of anticipation and expectation.  I alluded to this in a previous review. Its probably not warranted but, its unavoidable! So I went with a few friends to Bachi Burger, giddy as a school..... boy.

Bachi is oddly located in a strip mall so I missed it on the first pass and unfortunately for them they have an entry door on either end of the place so I imagine it can be hard tracking the new arrivals.  The venue itself is a small sit down type place that is clean, modern, and simple.  The 2 flat screens on the wall had news and foodtv running for some entertainment variety.

Our server came up quick after being seated and drink were served right away. The menu (if the name didnt give it away already) is asian inspired and has several options for food and drinks (yay boba tea). I ordered the Kiki burger and the truffled parmesan fries.  The first thing you taste on the burger is the bun and oh boy was it tasty!  Its an asian style sweet bun and it is awesome. The meat was very fresh and all the ingredients had a good harmony together and everything tasted great. The fries I expected to have more of a truffle flavor but, fell just a little short.

The only thing that kinda bugged me was our server kept trying to take plates that had a little food left on it. Now here is the kicker I would highly recommend this place to anyone here in town but, it only got a 4 star review from me.  Why? Because 5 stars is perfection. And this place fell just short on the flavor profiles. Everyone at the table agreed it was a great burger at a great price but, we just weren't blown away. I will be coming back shortly and ordering a few other things and will update this review then!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Is a family favorite. one of the few places that I can take my picky teens two and both love the food. The staff is wonderful and service is always good. Ignore the low raters, they are haters. You will love this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the family. We all got a different burger they were all great couldn't decide my favorite. Strawberry guava shake is the best thing that's ever happened to me! Our server Marcos was very sweet and gracious. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bachi used to be a favorite for me. However I was there Friday night and the experience was sub-par to say the least. First, the server was very slow and inattentive. We got our drinks (sodas and iced tea), but we had to ask for waters 3 times. The host finally came over and brought them. The server seemed annoyed, but that's OK. In fairness, the appetizers were GREAT! Calamari and Ox Tail Chili Fries - awesome. There were 5 of us at the table and we all loved them - even got another order of calamari. Dinner comes - my girlfriend gets hers, then almost 10 minutes go by before the rest of get our food - our server, the hostess and another server brought the orders (along with apologizing for the delay) finally. Back it up a bit, 2 items we ordered were 86'd (out of the item), OK - ordered something else, no big deal. So, I ordered my burger VERY well - done, do't judge, that's how I like them. My friend ordered his well done. When the server brought our burgers  asked which was which, she said (and I quote), \"Uhhh, the more well-done one should be the smaller one.\" Um, OK. So it wasn't. It was medium at best, my friend who ordered well, ad the more well-done burger. And they were cold. I didn't send mine back, because I didn't want to wait. They were also obviously thinner than they used to be. The only thing the server did quickly was bring our checks. So quick in fact, one of was still eating! I'm not talking about 1 bite left, I mean half of his meal. She dropped off the checks and was back in less than 90 seconds for the payments. I know because I timed it out of curiosity. Unfortunately for her, her tip was commensurate with her level of service. Couldn't blame her for the under-cooked burger or the 86'd items, but I can blame her for the lousy service and bum's rush at the end. I will add that Bachi Burger is normally very busy and you need to wait for a table, this time it was barely 1/4 full. I see why now. Very sad to see this place in this condition. A final note - the bathroom - the urinal was out of order and judging by the dust on the Hefty bag covering it, it had been for some time. And the curtain separating the dining room from the bathroom hall was very obviously filthy."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all and overpriced! I am a burger fan, and thought we would try it, since its a new different place. Yeah not! The waiter did not seem to care about our table, or that he knew what he was doing (I dont think he was in training) but we had to ask for everything, and then a bigger party came in after us and they were taken care of before us and their order and everything, not cool! So we wont be back, also when I tried to order basic burger, because everything else did not sound good at all. the waiter begged me to order a speialty burger, I do not like to be forced to order something I wont eat. Also hate when you have to buy fries seperate with your meal, seriously....oh well they had blew their first impression with me...."}
{"text":"Oxtail Chili Fries - YES.  I've ordered it once before... several months ago... and then again during my last visit during Thanksgiving weekend.  I thought it was great back then, it was even better the second time (much more oxtail meat this time around).

Crusty Crab - Yes, please, more.

I've had one burger here the last time - truffle burger?  I don't remember.  Either we added an egg or it came with it - either way, it was amazing.

I came here with my cousin, who is very much a fast food type of burger guy and he was seriously blown away.  Before I could even finish Instagramming my crab cake burger, he was 3/4 the way done with his burger.  Seriously - I can't imagine you could possibly go wrong with any burger on the menu.  It is seriously divine.

Service - top notch.  I came here on Thanksgiving weekend and it appeared to be really busy or just understaffed.  The food was seriously worth the wait and the staff was very very friendly and helpful.  They were not as attentive as I would have liked (which was completely understandable given their circumstance as previously mentioned), but if you are observant, you can see that they were absolutely trying their best and hardest to accommodate the demand.  Five stars for the pulling through and their efforts.  They kept their cool and didn't let it get to them.  

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back with more friends and family for delicious burger goodness."}
{"text":"i have to say it hurts to give this rating. I was soon excited to get here ever since i saw the episode of DDD. I decided that today was the day. Well it was kind of a let down. I got to the restaurant and sat at the bar. The bartender was nice enough and got my name and even acknowledged it was my first time there. 
i ordered the oxtail chili fries and asked what was a really good shake. The salted marshmallow  and caramel. Boom done. Kind of down hill from there. I was there right at 1 and there was not a lunch rush going on. i counted. I was very specific about the dish, the egg, scrambled. I have never ever ever eaten an egg any other way. Sorry Wylie Dufresne, I just cant. 
Fries came out, over easy egg. I give it back and all that was done was the through it in a pan and just mashed it up and put it back on the plate. After seeing that show and watching the regulars next to me get the presentation and visual quality of the plate. I waste down. Also no silver ware. 
I finished the fries and they were good, not great. i guess i wanted to wash them down with my shake that never came. I was done and about to ask for my check, when the shake came. 
I have seen pics on line of what it looks like. it was not picture worthy. truth be told anyone that follows me or knows me on Instagram knows that my IG account is nothing but food and the restaurants i go to with descriptions of wha tim eating to the minutest detail. 
I paid my check, left a tip for the effort and left. sadly, disappointed."}
{"text":"MMMmmm. Pretty dang good. Definitely a different spin on burgers. Not traditional, and would not recommend someone who is in search of the 50's diner burger. 

Asian inspired and innovative! They serve a variety of different kinds of drinks like lychee green apple soda and other unique sodas (no refills though). The macha green tea is delishhh and plenty of refills. We did not have to ask for a refill for our green tea, very attentive staff. 

So far, I have yet to try any beef burgers. I've got the \"Lonely Bird\" and the \"Crusty Crab.\" I would definitely recommend the Crusty Crab because it was light and delicately flavorful...

Only complaint, and not much of a complaint, but I wish fries came equipped with a burger... but how can something as delicious as truffle fries come with an already delicious burger... it's almost a sin."}
{"text":"Modern decored  restaurant in an obscure mini mall a few mikes from the strip.  Got there right at opening so was promptly seated.  The Oxtail Fries were amazing although slightly on the sweet side.  A little spicier than I anticipated so I was pleasantly surprised.  The Bahn-Mi burger was also tasty, but once again slightly sweet.  The pickled veggies really make that burger..I'd want it piled high next time.  Can't wait to try the Ronin on my next trip.  Worth the $20 taxi to get out here!"}
{"text":"Way too over hyped and too expensive. Burgers were ok nothing special. $20 for burger and fries no drink"}
{"text":"Bachi burger is worth the wait if come to this location.  I order the Kim Chi Burger. I love this burger and stick with it! ordered with the Garlic fries. The Burger Is Meal By Itself. Nice Thick And Juicy!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not all that impressed when it comes to burger restaurants, but I have to say this is definitely a new favorite of mine! Their menu is full of variety, uniqueness, and caters to every flavor and style you are looking for! Bachi Burger has a completely different approach from the standard burger you might find anywhere else, so give a look on the menu to try something you've never had before! 

I didn't dive into their desserts or appetizers, but I had the eggplant, tofu, and mushroom burger (forgot the name of it), and OH MY GOD... HEAVEN without feeling an ounce of guilt! It was surprisingly delicious with the combination of the three of those things, and instantly has me hooked.

The service is also excellent. Take-out is fairly fast and efficient, and the ambiance of the restaurant is casual, trendy, and social. I'll definitely be returning to explore more options!"}
{"text":"Omg, I love the oxtail fries! It's a must order if you come here. We  killed that huge plate in a few seconds! Very interesting and a change in fries from the typical mexican fries. The wait can be a little long even though we came here one Monday night. Very crowded for a Monday night. I tried two burgers, the Ronin and the Miyagi-sans Wagyu Burger. I would say that the latter is more appetizing and more flavorful than the former burger. I would come back here!"}
{"text":"ok ive been here twice so far and both times ive been very satisfied..both times i got the ox tail chili fries which is a must must try..its sooo good..the first time i made my own burger which was good but i wanted to try one of their specialty burgers..so this time around i tried the Ronin burger which was awesome..the meat is so juicy and tasty and the toppings were spot on..I will definitely be back and back and back!!"}
{"text":"Came to bachi on Friday last week with wife and friends. The one thing that stuck out to me about this place was that it has a very sleek and modern feel to it allot of hard wood everywhere and very little decorations making it feel very clean. 

The service was really good. The server was attentive and very knowledgeable. We ordered a Mr. Myagi Burger and some garlic pepper fries to be split between my wide and myself as I was not sure if we'd truly like the place. When the food came out the presentation of it was definitely top notch. You could tell that they use high quality beef just by looking at it. When I cut into the burger immediately the juices started flowing out letting me know that this was going to be a very tasteful burger. The beef on this burger was to die for it is definitely some of the highest quality beef that I have seen used on burgers. My wife is not a big beef eater and even she loved it which says allot. The fries were ok they definitely lacked a taste of garlic.

The reason for my 4 stars is because the meat was that good. I'm not a fan but I can't down high quality. However the price to me seemed a bit high, but I guess you do pay for what you get, but if that is truly the case then I truly didn't get my monies worth on the fries but the burger was stupendous.

Will consider trying this place again perhaps with a gropoun or some type of deal."}
{"text":"Great place! We had the oxtail chili cheese fries for an appetizer- pretty good but could have used a little more cheese in my opinion. For my main dish I had the pork belly steamed buns. So good! I've tried  pork belly a few times before and it can be on the dry side, but not these! And the steamed bun itself was amazing. My boyfriend had the Kiki burger and it was also very tasty and juicy. The portions are generous here so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Service is awful, but the food is good. We went for my GF's birthday. We were a group of 10. I made reservations 1 day before and when we got there, our table was not ready. The waiters are very unexperienced; forget orders and not attentive. After ordering our food, we got our drinks and did not get our food until an hour and a half later. Geees! Our guest were beginning to complain from hunger. I asked for the Manager and a guy with dirty finger nails and t-shirt said he was the supervisor. I told him our issue and asked if he can compliment us with any appetizers in the mean time while we wait for our food because everyone was hungry and he said that 10% of the check is all he can do. We were so disappointed. I suggest getting some experienced staff."}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here ever since seeing it on Triple D.  We ordered:

Pork Belly Bao - Very tasty, a must try!
Duck Bao - not as good as the Pork Belly
Oxtail Chili Cheese fries - not as good as advertised.  It's ok.
Banh Mi Burger - Very good. You can tell it was inspired by the sandwich
Kalbi, Ronin, Kiki, & Miso Burgers - Family gave them 2 thumbs up

Everyone was happy with their meal here.  Bachi has been added to our list of must stops next to In-n-Out when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"If your from the Washington DC area and like Ray's Hell Burger you would like this place. Its like an asian fusion burger place. I had the Kiki burger and some parmesean truffle fries. Both were good."}
{"text":"Wow! After waiting for 25min to be seated, our waitress was pretty cool. My food however was disgusting! My ox tail chili fries where SUPER SALTY! It took the chef 40min for my burger to come out of the kitchen, my bun was burnt, I ordered a medium rare, only to get a overly well done burger. The manager clearly doesn't care about her customers, because the previous complaint from guests next to us, we're brushed off. I doubt I will ever be back! Thanks for a fucking horrible experience Bachi burger!"}
{"text":"I usually get the Shogun Burger. This burger is everything, let me tell you. It's sooooo good! If you like foie gras, this burger is your answered prayer. It has wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and yamamomo peach. Dreamy right? I've been here many times and what can I say. I'm addicted"}
{"text":"Love the food! The Shogun Burger is amazing. It's sweet, savory, has foie gras, (I usually have it on a taro bun but that's not standard), so good! Also the oxtail fries are very good."}
{"text":"Good, but the only thing left to memory was that after adding on items to my kids' burger is that it came out to $14. Without fries. Or a drink. Not even a color mat or crayons to keep them entertained. 

The Kiki burger and oxtail fries were good. I wish that there were bigger chunks of oxtail, but it had the flavor. My shake was really good, not too sweet or thick. 

Awesome music playing
Parking was kinda hectic
30 min wait on a Monday night

I'd come back with the husband and friends, but feed my kids McDs beforehand."}
{"text":"Based on several recommendations by my friends in the local area, I had to try Bachi Burger. It appears they have two locations around the Las Vegas area although they are opening one up in West LA in 2013 which is good for me. This burger joint is somewhat distant from the strip, however, well worth the stop. I'd recommend coming during off peak hours. When we were leaving, there was a big line for dinner to this place, a indicator that there is good food inside. The service was really good. The waiters were trained to introduce themselves and to answer any questions that we had about the menu.

As an appetizer, I had a piece of my friend's Pork Belly Steamed Buns It contained Duroc Pork Belly, cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette, and hoisin sauce. I typically don't like eating steamed buns, but when I took a bite into this, it was SO GOOD! It made me rethink my stance on steamed buns.

Also, I requested the fries to come as an appetizer. I ordered their truffle parmesan fries which contains parmesan reggiano, black truffle shavings, chives, and comes with a side of sun dried tomato aioli dipping sauce. I was disappointed at their truffle fries. I was hoping that they would have utilized truffle oil to cook the fries. Instead, it tasted your typical french fry you would have at any fast food place. If I had to do it over again, I would skip the fries as their selection of burgers and appetizers are so much more appealing.

Finally, for the main course, I had the Spicy Miso Burger which contains a massive patty of Angus beef, onions, shishito peppers, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, and apple vinaigrette sauce. When a took a bite out of this sandwich, I was wondering what happened to the shishito peppers? I didn't really taste the peppers at all. I was completely overwhelmed by the apple vinaigrette sauce. The sandwich was decent, but the combination of ingredients is suspect. Perhaps there is too much going on in the sandwich where it loses its identity as a spicy miso burger. 

If I am ever around this part of Las Vegas again, I would definitely stop by to try some of their other burgers such as their Kalbi burger."}
{"text":"Came to this place with my boyfriend (who now lives in Vegas) and he told me that this place is delicious. So we decided to check it out for my sake. 

Place itself is nice. Simple decor and nice ambiance. clean.

So first off I order the Taro Boba. Now, I am a total fan of the Taro Boba drink back in southern Cali but their verison of the this drink was not for me. I took a sip and it was over. I felt bad that the waitress had to take it away but I'm not going to sit there and pretend to enjoy it. I'll just stick to the ones I know back in Long Beach/Orange county. 

Anyhow, as for as the burger I decided to try a specialty of theirs. The \"Banh-mi\" burger (I think that how it was spelled...don't remember). I have to say that this burger was flavorful and simple. Not your average ketchup burger either. It had this asian twist to it with the picked carrots on the side and a side of which I think is a light fish sauce dipping sauce. 

As for the fries there were about 4-5 opinions to choose from I picked the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Comes in the silver ice cream cone looking thing. the truffles on top of the fries were interesting and has the consistency of cooked mushrooms. Over all I enjoyed it...it's nice to steer away from something you're use to once in awhile.  I had to knock off one star because of the Taro Boba drink. awful. Good place to eat but not to drink taro boba's."}
{"text":"This is a real late post, but I went here for the 1st time a few weeks ago. Food was amazing! 

Pork belly steam buns were fantastic  - fat crispy pieces of pork belly in a soft bun with some pickled veggie (3 pieces in an order). 

The kalbi burger was  good - juicy and the patty was cooked to how I requested. Although there was kimchi in the burger, I felt there could have been more of a kick in flavor to it. 

I wasn't a fan of the oxtail chili cheese fries with fried egg. It was good but too much going on flavor wise. 

If I were to come back again, I would come back for the ramen. I strongly recommend ordering the ramen. The shoku ramen was on point - broth was spicy and had amazing flavor, meat was tender and the boiled egg was perfectly boiled!

I also recommend ordering the burbon salted caramel milkshake - what a wonderful alcoholic dessert to accompany my meal."}
{"text":"I come here every time I come to Vegas. My favorite my place to eat. The spicy miso burger and fries are to die for. The wait isn't to bad. Got in right away on a Friday night. Great service. I will always be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't get to eat at this place often since I live so far away but when I do I get all smiley! I went in for a late lunch last fri cuz I was in the area. I don't remember our servers name but she was pleasant and fun to have . I ordered the KIki burger and I was not upset about that decision at all. It was incredible and yum so yum . Everything was great until I noticed some yelling like talk coming from the kitchen. It was a female and she was not sounding nice. I couldn't really tell cuz I wasn't trying hard to not stare but she seemed to be a shorter Hawaiian chef that didn't seem to be happy. I don't know why she was so mad , she makes great food why the anger? If I wanted to eat with anger I would go to my dad's :). I will be back cuz the food is good and the servers treat me like family but maybe the back of house should take a chill pill and relax . It's just food :)"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. It says 'Good for Kids' here on Yelp, but there are no changing tables in either bathroom. So I had to change my baby (with a mat that I had) on the sink. Not very hygienic, but had no other choice. Otherwise, good spot."}
{"text":"Was a bit worried about eating here due to selection... I'm a picky eater. Food ended up being good, I've had better. Wait staff need to pick up their game, slow and inattentive. Matcha was great though!"}
{"text":"The menu is identical as far as I noticed to bachi burger. 
I of course my usual favorite, the kiki burger, and the consensus was that my burger is the best. I say this one is fail proof, and hands down one of the best burgers in Vegas.

Truffle fries- 3 stars. 
Fried calamari- 4.5 stars. 
Duck bao- 2 stars. 
Kiki burger- 5 stars."}
{"text":"wendys makes a better burger. they try to had to be different. had a mr.ho's burger and it the only way i can describe the way it taste was like breakfast food gone bad and had some weird cinnamon after taste . also had the ronin burger not as bad but still not good. who puts arugala on a buger?

the service blows btw had to wait twenty min. for a check,( and not impatient costumer time) was just disappointing  i had heard many good things"}
{"text":"Pricey burgers. Good but not great. One burger was kind of bland. Ramen is tasty. Good selection of beers. Service was very friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"Really really good fries and the ketchup had a hint of pineapple in it which was a nice touch. Burgers are good as well and I'm glad that people can build their own burgers because some of the burgers made on the menu weren't that great to me or I didn't know what it was. I ordered egg on my burger and did not get egg on my burger, but I still thought the service was good overall and the burger was still good. I would definitely go back whenever I feel like a good burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Today I celebrated my friends belated birthday with her by taking her out to lunch. The service was slow and our waitress, while extremely busy, ignored us and didn't give us napkins or plates when she brought our appetizer. We waited for another 8-10 minutes for our waitress to ask for our entrees. Once we ordered it was a long time before they brought our order. At the end of the meal I was given a bill that was intended for another table. In previous visits, the service was a lot faster and better than today's visit. In regard to the food, the Kiki burger is good and very flavorful with lots of mushrooms."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger has been on my list to go visit/eat in Vegas for a while now and since our family's timeshare is less than 10 mins away, we decided to stop by. We literally  just walked out of this place with my fiancé and 2 young sons, one 8 and the other 3, and this is why....We saw how many people were waiting so we decided we'll just do takeout. It took a while for the hostess to even acknowledge us and when she did, she handed me the menu and told me we can order at the bar. Waited and waited...and waited for someone to finally greet me. Surprised how long it took given the fact there were so many waiters walking by, not even a hi/hello etc... FINALLY made eye contact with one of the three employees behind the bar BUT to only tell me that it'll be a 45 min wait for takeout the same as waiting to be seated! WTF is the point of takeout and on top of that, if that was the case someone (anyone) should've told us from the get and not have us wait around. No apology, no nothing! We ended up at McDonalds down the street and believe it or not, their customer service was 100xs better! So so so disappointed......"}
{"text":"I've ate here several times and it's perfect for when you want something beyond just your typical burger with a nicer atmosphere then the usual burger joint. The food is so good!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I have EVER had.  I always have a weekly In-N-Out craving, but after having this I was able to not eat fast food for a month.  (Not a joke).

But, on to the specifics.  I came here with 3 other people, and I had \"Mr. Ho's Burger.\"  When I first bit into it (and I'm not kidding when I say this), my eyes rolled back like the girl in the Exorcist movies.  Oh man.  There's only one other feeling that's better than this. (I think you know what it is, so that's why I won't say it.  Plus, I might get in trouble for it).  

If you're ever in the area, you NEED to try this place."}
{"text":"Ok, these burgers are expensive, but the ingredients are totally fresh and the uniqueness of the flavor combinations is spot on. Totally worth having. 

Because of the sauces the burgers are pretty rich and different than what most are used to, but that's part of their uniqueness.... Ooot oh, I'm totally drooling thinking of these burgers! Haha! 

The bun... I used to think brioche buns were the perfect burger vehicle, but now I'm not as sure! The texture is perfect. I don't know how - but your fillings actually stay in the burger bite after bite. And if you look at the pictures on here you can see that they aren't small burgers by any means!

My only point of contention is that the host also had to be our waiter, server and busser. Don't get me wrong, he did a good job and had a great attitude, but that's a lot of work for one person. After he seated us he said our server would be right over. I heard the server tell him she didn't want any more tables. That's pretty unprofessional! We were only a party of two! Kudos to that host, perhaps he's a supervisor or something? 

PS- don't miss the pork belly steamed buns - they were FANTASTIC!

...I wish this place wasn't 6 hours away from our house!..."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way... I don't like hamburgers and I was blown away with the specialty burghers at this place! Like GOOD with an \"F\"!!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner this past weekend! It's been awhile since I've been here. I've been wanting to try bone marrow for a long time and they had it on their menu! So I ordered that along with the oxtail chili cheese fries for me and the \"No meat here\" burger for the wifey with an order of their salt and pepper garlic french fries.

The bone marrow came out first. I didn't know what to expect but it was AMAZING! I'll just call it meat butter. I spread it on toast and the overall flavors and texture was out of bounds! The oxtail chili cheese fries as AMAZING as well. So much richness and flavors. The kicker was the fresh jalapenos that added the necessary fresh and crisp (and spicy) element to this plate. I couldn't even finish half of the plate. The wifey enjoyed her burger and the garlic fries even more. 

Service was great. Our server was patient and friendly.  The quality and love they put in this food is noticeable from the presentation to the actual taste. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great testing food !!BUTTT they are understaff !!! You have to wait 15-30 min to get sit in and another 20-40 min to get the food !!!
Shame for a great restaurant! 
If you have 1.5-2 hours to lose is worth to wait."}
{"text":"It was so bomb I had the kiki burger and truffle fries!!! Apple lychee soda was good too..our server was really nice..I wish I had gotten her name.. The AC wasn't working but I won't let that affect a review.. My main thing is good food and service.. Mechanical glitches happen..."}
{"text":"I kept hearing great things about Bachi Burger the last few times I've been to Vegas. So we finally made it here on this trip and wanted to see what the hype was all about.

Since there were so many choices we asked our server for recommendations. She said the most popular ones were the Banh-Mi, Miyagi-san's, and Shogun burgers.  

I had the Miyagi-san's Burger: wagyu beef, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings. It was good but could have been a little more flavorful. I think the quality of the beef made the burger great. 

We shared 2 types of fries: 
Just fries served with pineapple ketchup which was literally just fries. I probably wouldn't order this again.
Sweet potato fries served with yuzu citrus aioli. These fries were really good!! 

The portion sizes were pretty huge. 3 of us could not finish the 2 orders of fries and I could only finish 1/2 of my burger. It was a little pricey but your'e getting a lot for it.

Glad I tired Bachi Burger but not sure I would come back again."}
{"text":"I took a bite of the shogun burger and immediately my toes started throwing up gang signs. Yeah, that good."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to coming here since I made plans to go to Las Vegas a couple of months ago. Since I've been waiting for so long, my expectation has been building up so high. When I get to the restaurant it's anti-climactic. Not today, Not here. 

You can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more. 

We got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately. 

Here's the rundown:
Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!

Pork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn't add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that's just my take on it. It's still a very very good dish. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure. 

Shogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call \"Umami\" if not I have a word for it \"Delicious!!\" It's got a hefty price tag, but well worth it. 

My son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a Béarnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that béarnaise sauce, oh so good. Anything with that sauce would be good. 

Usually reality out performs our expectations, not in this case. Reality out performed my expectations and it was high to begin with. Incredible meal. 

5 Star Plus
I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love burgers. We make them at home all the time. If I eat a burger outside my home it is either 1- in-n-out because I need something fresh and fast or 2- a gourmet burger.

This place falls into #2. A burger that is cooked to perfection, juicy and moist with delicious toppings. Placed on a toasted bun. It's fantastic. 

Try the KiKi burger, you won't be disappointed. All the fries are bueno too."}
{"text":"The menu is very original, love the sound of everything. I got the Kiki burger and my hubby got Black and Green burger. They both tasted just OK, neither is in my top 10 burger list. Location was good, plenty of parking. But the food to me was nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place for burger has really tasty burgers,and the prices are good try the truffle burger it's really tastes good"}
{"text":"Definitely starting to go down hill. Service is exceptionally slow. Not busy slow. But the type of slow where the servers deliberate if they will come to your table. When they do they go through the motions as if time were of no consequence.   Food takes a long time to come out now.  It's not fast food so don't think that way.  The amount of time it took for a kid's hamburger with ketchup only to make it to the table seemed to be as long as watching paint dry.   Now it's over priced hipster food that hipsters won't eat."}
{"text":"This place has excellent burgers, really really slow service.

I came here with some friends for lunch.  The place was 1/2 full, yet there were 2 groups waiting ahead of us.  The waiters ran around in front of us for 5-10 minutes without acknowledging us standing there.  One of the groups ended up leaving while we waited.

Once we finally sat down though, things got better.  We shared their brussel sprout appetizer and oxtail chili cheese fries, both of which were very tasty. The actual burgers are massive, and two of us could have split one burger.  I tried bites of the Ronin burger and the Pork Belly Bao.  I enjoyed all the fusion flavour combinations.

I consider this to be a place I would bring out of town guests to, but I'd make sure we came before we were absolutely starving so we could handle the wait :)"}
{"text":"I would give it 6 stars if I can.  This is the most favorite burger I've experienced so far.  If you're visiting las Vegas, make sure you stop by."}
{"text":"Bachi Burger is the place my boyfriend took me to celebrate our Valentine's day dinner! It was Amazing good in every way possible! The place was packed with other couples in love this special night of course and we only waited 15 minutes to be seated which was good considering the crowd!

My boyfriend and I started off with the Oxtail chili cheese fries, mmmmm soooo delicious and flavorful we really enjoyed sharing this large dish as an appetizer! I was doing a lot of moaning while we devoured this delicious and massive dish!

I opted for the bahn mi burger which was very tasty and juicy with all of the right ingredients. I had an order of the plantation sweet tea which was delicious and refreshing!

My sweetheart got the Wagyu spicy miso burger and he really loved the great quality meat and sensational flavor of the burger! He also enjoyed his giant glass of root beer in which he had many refills! 

We enjoyed our romantic and fun dinner out on Valentine's day then off to the movies!"}
{"text":"I went on a last minute one-day trip to Vegas for Jay-Z's magna carter world tour and a friend of mine told me to stop by this place. When I first walked in, I knew this place was going to be worth my wait. In fact, I didn't wait very long. I ordered the bachi fish burger and may I add that it was freaking delicious!! Everyone is super friendly and the food is great. I love this place and will add it to my \"must go to every time I visit Las Vegas\" list!"}
{"text":"I had some crazy high expectations going into Bachi Burger.  I had heard so much about it on a previous trip to LV, I couldn't wait to get back out and finally give the burgers a try.  I ordered the Miyagi burger, medium.  Hubby ordered a basic hamburger with cheese.  The bun is certainly tasty.  My meat was tasty, but slightly overcooked and a little dry.  I appreciated the effort at the unique flavor combinations in the burgers, but I don't feel like the execution was as great as I was expecting.  My husband, not a fan of sweet potato fries, said they were the best he's ever had and actually ate the bulk of the \"fry cone\" that we ordered.  That's a good thing, I suppose.  Service was good.  Drinks were consistently full.  I love that they offer iced green tea.  Always a nice touch.  Overall, it was okay.  I wouldn't be adverse to coming back and trying something different, but there are plenty of other burger places I'd like to go to first."}
{"text":"I also happened to see this on a food show, so maybe my expectation was too high. 
We decided to order, Shogun burger: the one has wagyu beef, unagi and seared foie gras , Black and green burger and Oxtail cheese fries.  
Fries: blehhh.. the egg was overcooked so no more running yolk. Oxtail with chili sauce that had weird flavor, too much bean? maybe not for me. 

Black and green burger: Hmm compare to Roam burger in SF.. it was about the same and Roam was so much CHEAPER.
Shogun. I think this was the best burger that they had. 26$ but because of foie gras and wagyu , I think its okay. 

Service? ehhh..?!!!! . Noone refill water and coke for us until we pay the bill?!!!!
Last but not least, we stayed at Encore so the round trip taxi for us to go back and forth was70$ +70$ for the bills. 140$ total. Worth it? Nooooo. 
Definitely not gonna come back here again."}
{"text":"Service was 2 and food was solid 3 stars.
Expected more from a place that charges up to $15 for a burger."}
{"text":"Burgers- yes. Flavor- yes. A must. But the grilled veggie sandwich??? Trust me, skip it, it's awful. The fries are just ok for the price. Homemade sodas are sweet & fruity. You want a juicy burger, this is a great place. Want anything else...like seriously anything else, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat and saw that it was on the pricier side, so I was hesitant to go with my friends.  Well, boy was I surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Happy Hour lowered the prices and the edamame (greasy but delicious), fries (perfectly cooked, nice toppings) and milkshake (salted caramel - I was sad when it was gone.  Really smooth) make me a fan.  Good service as well.  My pals said the burgers were good so we'll all go back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I have heard so much about it. However, my fiancé and I didn't even get a chance to try anything! We waited almost 20 minutes after being sat down at our table for anyone to tend to us. It wasn't that busy and they asked other customers if they were ready for a check or for desserts. The only thing we got to taste was water, and look at the menu. No one tended to us, when they finally did, the waitress, with an attitude, said, \"You ready?\" And when we said we were going to leave she just said, \"oh.\" We weren't even rude about it, but she was. Customer service should ALWAYS be your priority. Hopefully, the other locations aren't as bad as this because I'll be letting everyone I know that this place has terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!  Incredible!!  Superb beyond any unit of measure!!  Can you tell I love this place?  Now, I only eat organic, grass fed beef so that does limit my burger eating but I still think this place wins hands down over other burger places!  My favorite burger is the Black & Green (with bacon on the side for my hubby).  The sweet potato fries are so good but get the sauce from the garlic fries!!  The garlic fries were not very garlicky which I was a bit sad about. The buns are amazing!! The adult milkshake is soo good but thick so best as a dessert!!  Service is fabulous!!  This is my new go-to burger place!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time! Service was outstanding...they need one in Houston!"}
{"text":"Before coming to Bachi burger, I did my homework.  I researched the menu, read reviews on yelp, and even watched \"triple D\" just so I'd be prepared.  

Somehow I just wasn't WOW-ed. Maybe if this place weren't so over-hyped and crawling with other foodies lining up outside, I would've lowered my expectations just a tad.  

We ordered the Miyagi and spicy miso burgers with garlic fries.  Both were decent burgers flavor wise. But neither were juicy nor truly satisfying.  The fries were warm, well seasoned, but not crispy.  For the prices, I felt a little ripped off.  

Service was pretty good. Food came out in a decent amount of time though it did seem like some other tables were dragging.  

Overall decent and if in the area again,  I might give it another try."}
{"text":"We came here while visiting a friend out here. Omg eat here. It's so fantastic. The salt and pepper garlic fries were super tasty. Me and my friend spilt the Kiki burger and the spicy miso. Both were great. Can't really go wrong with anything in the menu. Hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever eaten....

I ordered the Miyagi-san wagyu beef burger--chili mayo, bacon, egg, onion rings, and furikake.  It had a good soft bun which I like.  On paper, the burger sounded interesting, but in my mouth, it was amazing!  I recommend this burger to anyone that visits Bachi Burger.  You will not be disappointed.  Almost too good to be true considering the base ingredients involved, but all positivity here!

Service was OK....  The server forget our drinks and didn't really provide informative responses to our questions on the menu items....

But if you are in Vegas, this eatery is a must-visit!  I hear they are opening an LA location...."}
{"text":"The food is always great, spectacular really. The pho and burgers are eclectic and offer flavor profiles for anyone; wether they be foodies or people just looking for a good meal. The two star rating this location is getting is purely for service. We entered the restaurant and waited at least eight minutes for someone to seat us- the other couple up and left- said they had already been waiting five minutes before we even got there. Why have a hostess station but no hostess? Finally a third server came from the back, looked over at us, and then offered to seat us. We got our menus and we were then forgotten. The server had apparently seated us in a different server's section and not communicated this to them. The new server was very short with us, and approached the table to ask if we had seated ourselves. The other server came over to the table and explained they had seated us- it was only then we got to order. Ordered the wings (they are delicious!!!) and were told they were out. Okay, so we ordered calamari for our app, put in the rest of the order, and waited. TEN MINUTES after ordering, the server comes out and tells us they are also out of calamari. Our actual food came out and as always, it looked amazing (Hubby got the black and green- my burger go to is the lonely bird) I take a bite of my burger and something tastes off- there is a texture missing. Realize they left the onion rings off the burger, so now on top of everything else, the food was incorrectly made. Our server did come over to the table and promptly got some onion rings so I could put them on, but the only reason we put up with the wait and everything else was the food. Needless to say I don't think we will be going back anytime soon and I would never take my friends or family to eat there. The service is inconsistent and they always seemed short-staffed and flustered."}
{"text":"I had the Kiki's Burger, which is angus beef, sautéed shittake, enoki, and eryngil mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli.  I added salt & pepper garlic French fries, too.  The fries were delicious and had slices of jalapeno included, which was a nice touch.  The burger was very tasty.  Excellent service, too."}
{"text":"It was okay. Too sweet of a burger for me, with the sauce overwhelming everything.  But it was cool how it taste like a vietnamese sandwich."}
{"text":"My cousin wanted to come here so I relented.  Interesting burgers and combinations.  We asked where they got the name \"Bachi\" since that means something not too good in Hawaii.  The answer?  It's short for Hibachi and it makes total sense.  

They were kind of busy so we waited about 10 min for a table which was a good thing since we could study the menu in detail.  By the time we were seated, I knew what I wanted to eat.  

Food took a while because someone in our party wanted their burger \"well done!\" - Yuck!  But they made it like they wanted.  Our server (forgot her name but she's from Waianae) gave us great information about the doneness and what she liked.  

Needless to say our plates were clean after it was all over.  

Going to try and come back again with my other friend."}
{"text":"Stopped by before hitting the strip to try what a friend called \"the best fish burger\". The atmosphere is casual and nicely air conditioned protecting the guests from the crazy heat. The service is friendly and attentive. Took off a star because of how long it took for our entrees to come out but the server apologized many times for the long wait. The bachi burger was delicious! I recommend it to any fish lover. With an Asian twist, the burger is plentiful and savory. It had some sort of teriyaki soy honey glaze and it was amazing. In addition to the burger I tried the truffle fries and salt fries both were delicious. The salt fries had jalapeños in it which gave it a delicious kick! We talked about the burger the entire drive to our hotel. Will return and will reccomend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Messed it up and then made it right! 
Another stop on my DDD tour and those of you, or that one of you, that reads my reviews know that I do not just dole out the four stars reviews. 
We were greeted nicely and ordered some adult beverages and some sausages.  Three stars could go for the sausages alone they were fabulous. Seriously, my partner loves when I give her \"sausage\" and she seemed equally pleased about the Kurobuta  and Arabiki sausages we received.  I must admit, I was a little jealous. (Just a little jealous, the sausages aren't that big.  Wink Wink)
Only two main hiccups.  When we asked what was the difference between the red sangria and the white sangria, we were told that one was red and one was white!? Really!?  Uhmmm....Ok.  Seeing our bewilderment the waitress went into small detail about the differences, but I am still not convinced that she actually knew.  I am sure that she will do better next time. It was good, but I still want to know what the big difference is, especially if they are both made with sake.  I'm quite sure that there is no red sake. 
The second hiccup was that  my dining partner loathes, simply loathes mushrooms.  She thinks that they taste like dirt.  And according to her palette she order the black and green burger without mushrooms.  And of course it came covered with mushrooms. I don't really get upset about the addition of the mushrooms, mistakes happen, but it throws off the entire pace of the meal when something like that happens.  Luckily the item was taken quickly back to the kitchen and the annoying fungi were removed.
A manager came out and did his best to make up the mistake.  The conversation was a little awkward between him and my dining partner but in the end we felt that he was making a solid attempt make up for the earlier error and that's what counts.
Oh let me talk about my burger.  I had the \"Shogun.\"  It was as epic as it sounds.  Wagyu beef, unagi and foie gras.  Foie gras!  You had me at Foie!
It was delicious, the only thing is that it comes with a sweet sort of chutney that works, but I am not a big fan of sweet with my savory.  When I come back again I will see if I can order it with the non-carne items of the side.
We also had the ox-tail fries.  I have red other reviews and would agree that for an entree that they  might need more meat, but as a side they were spectacular and a wonderful addition to our burgers.
Dessert was fresh doughnuts and coffee ice cream.  Excellente! Hai!
I will be back and you should go."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas on business with a group of five. We ate here twice and the food and service were the best! When we come back in town, we wil visit here again! Try the sauces. They are great."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger fan but my friend hyped this place up.

 I ordered their oxtail fries and it was good! I ordered truffle fries and it was just okay. Nothing special. 

I ordered the kalbi burger and I like how it came with Kim chi vegetables on the side. The burger itself was huge. 

The service was great. Friendly and was there to always refill our water. 

It was pretty empty when I came around 2pm.

Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"Bachi is one of my husband and I's favorite restaurants. The burgers are the best in town! We went on Thursday night and David was our server. He was attentive and friendly. Our food came out quickly as well. I had the kikis burger and my husband had the spicy miso burger. The burgers were a bit over cooked for medium but still very flavorful. All the staff was great and the manager even checked on us. The service was a breath of fresh air compared to most places in Vegas! A definite must for burgers!!!"}
{"text":"It's all delicious.  I wish I knew what they put in their ramen.  The broth was creamy and slightly spicy.  The porkbelly could be a cooked a little more, but the spicy miso ramen was great.  The shogun burger was also really good.  I left my seared pears on the side and nixed the unagi, and the burger was still rich and juicy.  I loved the foie gras and the oils from it enhanced the burger patty that much more.  The oxtail chili cheese fries were also a win.  I would like mine with a little more cheese to balance the sweetness of the chili, but overall, it was a great big dish of yum.  The boba pearls were a little on the chewy side for me, but the black milk boba was refreshing and didn't fill me up.

We showed up for lunch on a Monday and the place is packed.  A table for two would have only taken about 20 minutes, but we opted to sit at the bar.  Service wasn't super prompt, but we were never forgotten.  We wanted to try their fried chicken, but they had already sold out.  Next time Bachi Burger, next time."}
{"text":"The place was quite appealing.

Our server was overly nice and all of the items on the menu was his favorite...hmmmm....
For starters we tried the chili fried chicken and the garlic salt & pepper french fries....the chicken was not good at all...too much of their red sauce...it was both spicy and sweet.  We didn't care for it.  Fries were good on the other hand.

We ordered the Ronin Burger, The Crusty Crab, and Kalbi Burger.  The server didn't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked so we made sure that we told him.  Sheesh....After like forever we finally got our orders.  Everyone enjoyed their burger.  The bread was very good.  I loved it.

If not for their super slow service and annoying server it would have been a four star.  ;op"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BURGER PLACE EVER. It is far from the strip, but worth the drive.  Way bigger portions than Umami, about the same price. Loved the Miyagi burger- it has an egg and lots of great Asian-fusiony flavors. The ox-tail fries and the garlic fries are also amazing. They also have good drinks (like boba) and ramen (but get a burger). Can't wait for the one in LA to open up! Only con is that its usually busy and takes a while to get seated. Totally worth the wait though! (:"}
{"text":"Little bit more than a fan since I really had a lot of fun, ate well, and really enjoyed my shogun burger. They were able to accomodate my group of 20 at midnight on a Saturday no problem. Like the Asian themed burgers. Sorta reminds me of Umami burger but over there they serve sliders, they serve full size burgers here. House music plays all night long. 

*SHOGUN BURGER (5/5)- $26. Wagyu Beef x Unagi x Seared Foie Gras x Poached Asian Pear x Miso Butter. Had me lickin my fingers like I was eating some fried chicken. Maybe it's because I haven't had foie in so long since it's been banned in Cali but the burger was...... So rich. So lucious. So much umami flavor. So good. The juicy wagyu patty was cooked to order and had that distinct flavor. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=LR9rkRt2DKvzv-0OqUYIsQ#LR9rkRt2DKvzv-0OqUYIsQ)

*KALBI BURGER (4/5) $9
The kalbi marinade and kim chee made a delicious Korean interpretation for a burger. Burger mah sit sso yo! 

*SPICY MISO BURGER (4.25)  $10 
Still gotta knock Japan off my bucket list, but this tastes like something you'd get from there. The burger is huuuuge. 

*OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES (3/5) $12 
Good spice to the chili and I like the jalapenos but we were shorted on the oxtail. There was probably a few strands of tail in there. As good as it sounds, I'd recommend not ordering it. Truffle fries (3/5 - $4)  were OK. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=WiPeDnnQ-i-6y1Z_2UtEkg)

*RED VELVET and SALTY CARAMEL MILKSHAKES (4.5/5)  $6 ea. 
Order these! Wish there was more but I really liked how it was sorta melted so you could drink the shake. Tastes as advertised. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=JQFWvv783nmjygvI5Y3KVA#JQFWvv783nmjygvI5Y3KVA)

The burgers did take a little bit longer to come out and I'm not sure as a tourist if it's worth a special trip from the strip but I had a lot of fun and since my shogun burger and the shakes were so good,  It's good to have family and friends who are local!"}
{"text":"Sorry to see this place struggling. It has always been a go to place for us when visiting Las Vegas. Not anymore. We went there yesterday and were greatly disappointed.  They only had one beer on tap when the menu listed a much bigger selection. They had no bottled beer, only hard apple cider.  We ordered the calimari and chicken wings appetizers only to be told they had run out at 4 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon. The service was slow. It's obvious that something is amiss and that major changes will need to take place for it to survive."}
{"text":"This place had high hopes due to the 2k of reviews. But it didn't have that home run hit I was swinging for. The burgers were basic and for being in Las Vegas I expected slightly better quality of meat. It seemed over fatty and not seasoned well. But as far as the place was layer out it was cool. Not sure if I'd be back"}
{"text":"Let me just say, Bachi Burger packs one hell of a punch! Ever since I've tried their \"Miyagi San Burger\" I was astonished. Amazed with the components put into this burger! I am a burger person, and I will give this place 5 WORTHY stars! The atmosphere is sleek, service is awesome, food is excellent, what more can you ask for?!

Goal is to try every burger on their menu! 3 down, the rest to go! Try the ramen out too, its b.o.m.b"}
{"text":"Food was perfect. i got the galbi burger with house kim chi on the side. why the bad review? we came in with a group of 12+ we called in they accommodated us and had a warm welcome. So still why the terrible review...its courtesy especially when eating with people you havent seen in quite some time to wait for all the food to arrive at the table to begin chowing...2 of our parties food took 30 minutes later than everyone else's to come out. appetizers came in too fast which were fantastic (sweet potato fries) huge gap in between that and the entree. the waitress kept telling us the kitchen was behind and that the burger was being made. 10 minutes later she told us that they forgot the order. finally after 30 minutes the burger comes out. i dont care how many orders you have, the next burger should have been ours but no...we watched tables come in and sit down and get their food faster.

when coming to visit vegas, my friend told me this place was great and he wanted to try it. sadly i was a little disappointed not by the food. but its not always bad food that ruins the experience."}
{"text":"Bachi burger is the BOMB! There are no words I can use to describe the flavor and complexity of their burgers. The flavor combos are mind blowing. I had the Ronin burger done medium and the wagyu patty just melted in my mouth. The oxtail chili fries were so neat and exciting. I can't wait for them to open in Santa Monica! Yay! If you're in Vegas you have to stop by and try this place. You won't be disappointed. Service was good and the restrooms smell like cotton candy (sounds unbelievable but true). Thank you Bachi burger"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I designed my own burger with shishito peppers and it was so good.  Pepper garlic fries had a kick to them but were delicious. My husband had the miso burger, again amazing.  The best part, the milkshake.  We had salted caramel marshmallow.  YUM! Great place."}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation from a friend... If saying the word \"kobe beef\" and \"burger\" before jumping in my car even counts as a recommendation....

Although being quite distant from the strip, this place lived up to my expectations. The \"asian fusion\" burgers were just as I dreamed they would be: flavorful, unique, and damn good idea. The menu was mouth-watering. They had so many items that I wanted to try.

I had the Ronin burger which had \"Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma, Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ~if that didn't get your attention, then there is something wrong with you.

The girlfriend go the Kalbi Burger which was \"Ground Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo.\" AWESOME.

We ordered a side of Truffle Parmesan fries which was equally amazing.

If I hadn't tried the back abbey back in so cal, I'd call this place my favorite burger joint, it was close, but sorry, the best burger award goes to them."}
{"text":"4 items on the menu tried:

- Kiki's Burger: cooked to order (I had well done), 2 kinds of mushrooms, a nice variety of veggies to top it off besides the usual lettuce, the bacon onion marmalade is probably the best part because who doesn't love bacon.

- Truffle Parmesean Fries: absolutely delicious although I wished they had placed more truffle on it and a tad more parmesean.

- Sweet Potato Fries: Crunchy, with a subtle dipping sauce 
 I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoe fries, but worth trying.

- Green Milk Tea w/ Boba: Meh, I've had better at an actual tea house.

Service was great, got checked on a few times and no pressure on leaving. 

Will definitely come back and try that $23 burger &&maybe their sliders &&desserts &&..."}
{"text":"Just ok at best. I know they are trying to be different and all that, but they miss with the taste. I rather have a regular burger over some crazy combination. The line is also very long every time you go. Don't ask me why!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and inventive menu, but dangggg sometimes less is more. So much going on. I was so overwhelmed by all the add ons and bells and whistles that it had me craving for an in and out burger instead. Tasty burgers and quality products, but I found some things to be a bit overrated, such as the oxtail chili fries. And why would I get wagyu beef if I can't taste it over the different sauces cheeses fried things brioche slaw blah blah piled high on top of it? It doesn't make sense to me.

Perhaps as inventive and novel as BB tries to be, the conscious creativity effort undercuts the taste and inadvertently over promises under delivers flavorwise. Good food styling though."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi Burger.... When will we see each other again? It's a shame you live so far from me. I must say, the times we do meet up, things happen. All good things of course. Your spicy miso burger really makes me hot. I keep coming back for more. It's a incredible experience to say the least... Excuse me, I have to go clean up."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every time we are in the area this place is a must stop!  Everything we've had here is unique and really good!  If you drive by this place and don't stop here, you should probably just quit for the day and drive home because you've already failed to be happy."}
{"text":"Ahhh darn it. I had such high expectations but Bachi has disappointed. I thought the oxtail fries would have chunks of meat, but it's just basic ass chili cheese fries with an egg on top. Also, its sweet. Why?! :(

The ronin burger was good, I would say 4/5. The bun was really soft and fluffy. This was sweet as well, which I would usually like, but with the overly sweet fries, it was a sugar overload.

The pork belly bao were okay, not bad but not amazing. Would not order again. The best part of the meal was the burger and my strawberry lemonade.

Unless a friend was really craving Bachi, I wouldn't bother making another trip out."}
{"text":"I can't wait 'til the next time I go to Vegas and can eat here again. Oxtail fries are good, but the duck bao beats it! The salt & pepper garlic fries and truffle parmesan fries are also really good. Literally seems like everything you order there is good! The boyfriend and I could barely split and finish the myagi-sans wagyu burger because we were so full from all the other items our greedy stomachs ate! Needless to say, my hungover stomach was very happy and I'm sure my friends tummies were too!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday with my husband and our twins. It was AMAZING !!!! Great food, the employees were awesome, the environment was great! All around amazing experience. We literally wanted to tell them we loved them when we left ?. Def will be back before we leave town.

{"text":"The staff was so courteous and served us graciously even though we walked in to dine in just minutes before closing. The music was on point and the Asian twist on burgers and fries was mouth watering!"}
{"text":"So so service, the hype about this place makes it seem as you are going into a great location  with amazing  service and amazing food but the reality  is that it is another  burger joint. I decided  to come here and check it out and I must say, it was just ok. I won't be back as Reb Robin can provide the same experience with better service."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Enjoyed kalbi burger, miso buger, and Portuguese donuts!! The pork belly buns are yummy too, but I think I've had better at momo fuku! I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and delicious to say the least.  Been here a couple of times, and the service is good to very good only.  Only issue we have is how long it takes at times when you're ready for the check.  Doesn't seem like they move very fast when you've got to leave.  Understandable when the place is busy, but both times in the last 2 months we where there with less than 9 customers and it took 10-15 mins to pay once we asked for the check."}
{"text":"Ever since this joint was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it's become way too busy and disorganized. During our visit in March, this place was packed with a 30-45 minute wait at 3pm and there was only ONE waiter. What was even more puzzling was there were 5 bussers and table runners.The manager was just standing behind the counter doing nothing while everyone was running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Wtf. AND to top it all off, we were sitting in clouds of smoke and this was the second time where the A/C was not working hard enough. 

Good thing for them the food is worth it... The Banh Mi Burger and Pork Belly Sliders are both a must try.  But if they don't fix the exhaust fans and A/C, I'll have to pass next time.  Too bad."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in town, hands down.  I've had the Kiki and the Kalbi burger.  Both are amazing.  So flavorful and unique.  The bun is super soft and light.  The truffle parmesan fries are AMAZING.  I die for those fries.  I had a taro boba and that was pretty yummy, too.  

Service isn't great (just kinda slow) and I wish I could take half a star off for that but the food is so good it makes up for it."}
{"text":"I went here once before. Food is good, but there is always a wait. I am typing this now waiting in line as we speak. The reason for a low rating is there are open tables ready to seat people, yet I have to wait 25 minutes for a party of 2. Unacceptable. Hire more waiting staff.

Edit: We finally got seated but took much more time to get our order in, get our food, and then our check. We won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"I was looking for a simple, casual, dinner in Vegas and this place was perfect.  It is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking.  We came around 6:30pm on Saturday and we didn't have to wait.  It is a little difficult to find because the sign blends into the building.  

The service was great and place was clean.  The food was awesome, quite possibly one of the best burgers I have had.  I recommend the Spicy Miso burger.  The Oxtail Tail fries were awesome.  Who knew that a fried egg on top of the fries would be oh so good.  

Loved this place!  I hope they open a branch in LA one day!"}
{"text":"Great friendly place, ceaser saled is amazzing. Glad a friend recomended here. The fries are so slim and yummy, desserts are yum."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas since 2009 and am now moving from the area, this Friday being my last day in the fair city that has become one of my favorites in the world. And for my last Vegas meal out? You better believe it's Bachi Burger! 

Yes, that is how good it is. My only regret is that I didn't come more often to try out every.single.thing on the menu because there was always \"next time\". Lesson learned, and now I'll just have to make special trips back to Las Vegas to get my fix. 

Farewell Bachi, and Farewell Vegas."}
{"text":"Whoever decided to mix Asian flavors and burgers was a genius and Bachi Burger does it better than anyone else. Get the chili fries- you won't regret it"}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, i would.  I had heard about this place for over a year from co-workers who travel to Vegas regularly.  I get my share of Vegas as well but this place is about 6 miles away from the strip and I hear it's a pain to get a cab back.  So it's taken me nearly a year to try this place, but i'm glad i finally made it!

Enough storytelling, time for the good stuff.  Bachi Burger puts an Asian spin of the traditional burger and combines some of the things you love in Asian cooking into a sandwich.  Our goal was to try as many of the burgers as we could as there were three of us.  First, great beer selection here!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was a perfect side option for 3 people.  Comes with an egg on top.  The yolk mixed in with the chili and cheese is just the right amount of gooey goodness.

Again the goal was to try as many burgers as we can so we each decided to get something unique and promised to eat one half and split the other half into two so we can all get a taste of each other's.  This was a brilliant idea and I recommend you all try this if going as a group.

Burger # 1: Miyagi Burger - It's their signature burger and comes with grass fed kobe beef patty, some sort of amazing sauce, fried egg and onion strings.  Amazing texture and taste
Burger # 2: Spicy Miso: Simple with an amazing spicy sauce that provides just the right amount of heat. This was my favorite!
Burger # 3: Unagi Burger:  This one costs $24 but it's well worth the price.  It was a little too sweet and rich for my taste but def worth a try

So after all this we sat there.  Our stomachs were full but we still wanted to end with a bang. The debate was if we wanted dessert, and if so which ones.  Except I had another brilliant idea and recommended we get another burger and split it in three.  I think we were all thinking the same thing, I was brave enough to say it.  So we sat and wondered what else are we going to go with.  Our wonderful server recommended the Mr. Hong, since it was different than what we had already tried.  And what a great recommendation it was!  

So like I said, in the beginning, I'd give this place 6 starts if I could.  Not only was the food great, our server made sure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in.  I'm making Bachi Burger my go to destination every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh, I really want to like the place. I have eaten here a few times since they re-opened, this area is really lacking quality places to grab a quick bite. I am not much of a fan of the asian style burgers so I Order them plain. The meat is great quality making the burgers are delicious. The salads & truffle fries are also amazing, the food isn't my problem it's the wait staff.

Someone from higher management needs to take a look at the wait staff in this location. Nobody is paying attention to the tables as they chat behind the bar where there is not a single customer sitting. They act bothered when you ask for anything. 7 people are on the floor but nobody is doing anything more productive than marrying the sauce bottles. This is a town of service workers.. We notice when we receive crappy service ourself."}
{"text":"Food was great. Beers were cold on a hot day. Little bit of a drive from the strip, so if your taking a taxi from the strip, expect a $50 round trip..."}
{"text":"The bartender was such a jerk.
He rolled his eyes at us when he saw 7 people sitting at the bar. He separated all of the checks when we were very clear that the there was only 1 out of the 7 of us separate. On top of that which could be the kitchens fault the some (like three dishes including the appetizer) took over an hour to get. But everyone else got there stuff and even ate it before the other 2 got their food. But on the contrary the food was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Yep, I believe the hype... Bachi (short for Hibachi!) burger is super yums!!

I ordered the Ronin (carmelized onions+japanese cole slaw+miso koma dressing+FRIED EGG+bbq katsu) and it was very very good. They cook the beef to your specs, and the runny egg is just perfect! Definitely worth the $12. 

My friends ordered the Oxtail chili cheese fries....AMAZING, and everyone else in my party seemed to enjoy their respective burgers :) 

Next time...I'll try the Mr. Ho's :)

 The servers were all super friendly and helpful. We were there to celebrate a birthday, so they kept the surprise cake in the back for us, and brought it out with extra plates for everyone....and candles!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a little too high.. because the burgers here were just \"good.\" Not great, not spectacular, and not even memorable.

In an age where we have options like Umami and BurgR, Bachi's conceptually awesome... but my experience unfortunately left my tastebuds wishing for more flavor."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday for my first time. Sooo good! Friendly service. Delicious, quality burgers. Nothing like it. The place is a little small and pricey, but it's okay. Their fries and pineapple ketchup is super yum!"}
{"text":"Great service BUT our food was highly disappointing!  The pork belly buns were delicious; however, the Black and Green Burger was filled with mushrooms the texture of leather.  The Bachi Fish Burger was tough and had no flavor.  The Miyagi-San Burger, though cooked to perfection, was flavorless.  The Oxtail Chili (Dennison's Chili?) Cheese Fries were soggy and something we wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"This location is so close to the house that it could be dangerous... With that being said, I've been to this location 3x already.

On my first trip, the Spicy Miso burger was mind blowing!. Being a hybrid Yoshi I though that putting Aka Miso on a burger was ingenious! It had me hooked at first bite. The burger had a nice zing to it however at the same time you could taste the quality of the meat. It was so good that I came back a few days later for one. Unfortunately the encore came up a little short. It lacked the same zest and boom that made me fall in love with the first one. The first one was popping with the spicy miso flavor however the second was lacking all of the above and was just a burger...

On my third visit I got the Kalbi burger, I was hoping that it would be something crazy like ground kalbi but it once again was on the mild side and just kalbi sauce. Very timid, but decent nonetheless. 

I would go out to say that the only thing that was consistent was the fries. The garlic fries were nom each time. I really didn't care for the truffle fries as they were a bit messy and more confusion vs fusion (but that's just my opinion). 

I will address the reviews with issues about service. Each time we dined here, service was fine. I never had to ask for water refills and was consistently checked up on so I will put my neck out and disagree with the service issues.


I really hope that the next Spicy Miso I get will blow me away and make me fall in love with this place again. The last star depends on it! 

AND word on the street is that Buldogi's (right down the parking lot) has Korean fusion burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this location all the time however we moved zip codes so now our default location is the Sahara location. We were in the area earlier this week and decided to stop in for dinner. Man has this place changed. I have always commended the brand for maintaining a consistent product at their locations however this location seems to have gone rogue. The food here is nowhere near the expectations and standards of the other locations. The first fopaux on this visit came with our wings. The plating and presentation was very nice however the looks were very deceiving. The top 2 wings tasted as they should (sauced and at the right temp) however the bottom 4 wings were ice cold and raw in the center. 
The second issue came with the fries. The salt pepper garlic fries did not have the same shishito pepper taste, only 2 or 3 slivers of peppers and were super salty. The truffle parmesan fries were cold, did not taste of any truffles and only a small drizzle of the brown mushroom sauce and NO parmesan on it. We had to ask for a side of the mushroom gravy and sprinkle it ourself. 
Now to the burgers... 
We have frequented bachi enough to have tried all of their burger (with the exception of the shogun) and have settled on what we like.

Me: spicy miso add bacon medium/rare
The lady: Kiki burger medium. 

So the lady's burger came out \"ok\" however the bacon was undercooked and very skimpy (maybe a 2\" soggy sliver).
My spicy miso was super sad:
The shredded lettuce was not the normal type that we are accustomed to (don't know the exact name) but rather old shredded iceberg lettuce. As mentioned with the lady's burger my bacon was also undercooked and very skimp. Usually the bacon is crossed and sticking out of the bun however all I got was one small (less than 1\" piece) of undercooked bacon. 

The good:
The service here on this visit was very attentive. They did seem to be a bit short staffed however they did their best to be attentive to us and all of the other guests. They did empathize with the undercooked food and offered to comp us for the chicken and discount our the remainder of our check. 

This last visit was really disheartening as we have been avid supporters of the brand and constantly promote it with all of our guests and visitors. After this visit I can. I longer recommend this location. I hope that management can take the constructive criticism and improve the product consistency at this location. For now my recommendation is to satisfy your Bachi craving at one of the other 2 location."}
{"text":"Oh Bachi, I didn't want to love you. But love you, I did.


My brother was visiting and Bachi was a must do on his list. So off we went.

We ordered a kids menu grilled cheese and fries, oxtail fries, fried calamari, bahn mi burger, kalbi burger and bachi fish burger. Since it was our first time, we all shared our food since we wanted to try a little bit of everything.

 I actually loved everything except the oxtail fries. They were good, but I wasn't impressed. 

The fried calamari was good. However, you get such a small plate for $12. Definitely not the best calamari I have had in town, so for the price I would pass on this.

The bahn mi burger was Amazing. I could really taste all the flavors expected out of a bahn mi and the burger itself was juicy and cooked perfectly. Nuoc cham for a dipping sauce too? Oh yeah, you can't go wrong.

The kalbi burger was Delicious as well, just a little bit salty. I was a huge fan of the cucumber kimchi served on the side. I wanted more of that. I couldn't get enough.

The fish burger did not let us down either. It was very moist and delectable. 

The winner for me was my son loving his kid friendly meal. It is important that a kid meal is actually kid friendly and I wasn't too sure at first but his grilled cheese was perfect. Cheese melted in between a hamburger bun with a side of fries. My only complaint - too expensive. 

So yeah, I am on the Bachi Burger Train. We shall return. And return soon."}
{"text":"I was reading about this burger place awhile ago and finally got to try it last month in Vegas. Asian infused burgers isn't something many places have tried making, but they should, because it's delicious!

They're located a few minutes from the south strip outlets. The place is clean and very modern looking. They were busy for the lunch crowd but not hectic at all.

Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Open style steam bun loaded with flavor! Thick slice of pork bun that melts in your mouth.

Salt and Garlic French Fries - I go crazy over garlic fries. The fries were skinny cut and were the perfect size.

Mr Ho's Burger - Featuring Angus Beef , Pork, Green Onion, Cilantro Ginger, Garlic Hoisin Mayo, Chinese Sausage, Sautéed Mushrooms, Mizuna, all inside a Taro Bun. This burger is like a Chinese pork bun burger. I love the Chinese sausage which was implemented in the beef patty. The garlic hoisin mayo was sweet and tangy, and the taro bun balanced out the flavors of the meat.http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MGMXM26c3CIDRHT_NsaeSQ/l.jpg

All in all, everyone in our group loved the burgers here. Service was top notch when we were there. I will having seconds, thirds, and fourths here in the future. The unlimited green iced tea is the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"You can smell the burgers cooking as soon as you pull into the parking lot. And they smell great!

The mainstay is a bunch of Hawaiian fusion burgers. They all taste good. The fries, which are also a fusion kinda thing, are also very tasty. I highly recommend them.

There are a few salads. They are good, but it took forever to get the  order to the table and the portion was not that large for the price and time it took.

Then there is the usual drinks plus boba drinks. Good, but pricey.

All in all, I like Bachi Burger. It is a little slow, a little pricey, and not everything on the menu is worth ordering.
But, it is a unique place, clean, friendly, and the food tastes great.

I'll go back till I try everything at least once."}
{"text":"Spicy miso burger is amazing, banh-mi burger and sweet potato fries are also pretty good and service was great."}
{"text":"Finally went to try Bachi Burger after the Yelp Olympics event, as the restaurant was not far from ClubSport in Henderson.  And I am really glad that I went, because I didn't really feel like going to check them out after some not really great comments about their food from when they first opened.  But after my first bite into The Crusty Crab burger, I was hooked.  The burger was very flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it was not enough to make me feel full and more mushy than crusty. And as far as a crab sandwich goes, it was one of the better ones that I have ever had.

After that first visit with the Yelp crew, I went back to Bachi Burger for a late night dinner.  The place was relatively empty (weekday around 10pm) compared to a bustling Friday night, so I was seated quickly and was able to place my order shortly after I sat down.  This time I ordered the Bachi Fish, as that was the other recommendation from Nelson Q and other Yelpers, and the recommendation was spot on. I also ordered the Oxtail Chili Fries, which was decent but lacking in the oxtail department and at $10, not really worth the money.  I would rather spend that on another burger!  

Service was pretty good on my first visit, when they were so busy that they were not able to seat us until enough patrons left for them to combine some tables to seat our large party.  But on my second visit, service started out good but kind of went down hill after that.  I didn't like how it took much longer than expected to get the food out (almost 20 minutes on a slow night), and after dropping off the check that I have requested my server basically ignored me.  I guess chatting with coworker and folding napkins or whatever he was doing at the side station, was more important than processing payment from the credit card I had intended to use or make change.  In the end I just paid cash and walked out the door, and of course that was when they had that startled look in their eyes, as if wondering if I am skipping town without settling my tab.  

I am not sure if that is what people have complained about when they have less than positive comments about the service here. And I just don't understand why servers do what they need to do to provide good service, than can't finish strong and take/process the payment from the customer that are trying to pay. It is not like they work at a debt collection agency and have to cold call people on a list, and hating the negativity of their job that they procrastinate.

Food: 4 stars

Service: 1 - 4 stars. Seems like it is better when you have a large group or when it is busy, but really sucks when they are slow or you ended up with a crappy waiter.

Anyway, still giving Bachi Burger 4 stars for the food.  But if I go back alone, I rather just have it to go and not deal with this issue again and leaving tip when I really don't feel like leaving any. And I would not recommend The Oxtail Chili Fries, even though it is served with sunny side up egg on top (and I love that!), unless it costs less or there are more oxtail."}
{"text":"I have been suggesting that Bachi Burger open a second location in the SW since my first visit to the original location.  So when I found reviews on the new, and much closer, second location on W. Sahara, I was happy just like a lot of other Yelpers living in the vicinity.  So when fellow foodies suggested we meetup and give this Bachi Burger a try, it was a no brainer for me.

Perhaps in keeping with the theme of being bigger and better, the Summerlin location sports a larger dining room, as well as, a more extensive menu. The menu now spans four pages, instead of the original two sided menu, and looks great in their silver color menu cover.  Milkshakes, sake sangria, fried calamari, and Grilled Loche Duarte Salmon Burger are just some of the new items that are new additions to the Bachi lineup.

The hostess and our waitress were impressively knowledgeable about the menu, and did not hesitate to demonstrate their Jason Bourne-like photographic memory recall talent.  On a side note, how come \"Insert country\" Got Talent never showcase individuals that can recall the value of Pi?  Maybe that was part of the reason she knew who ordered what and checked on our table regularly.

Okay, moving on to the good stuff. This is a burger joint, with a lot of beefy burgers and other alternatives.  I however have always thought that their seafood burger lineup were better than their Angus or Wagyu fusion burgers.  Therefore, I opted to try their Grilled Loch Duarte Salmon burger, which I was told was only available at the Summerlin location.  I was not disappointed with my decision to order this burger. It was made with grilled smoked salmon from Scotland, with crunchy bacon, plus tomato, red onions and arugula to keep it healthy, and lemon herb mayo and ponzu vinaigrette for flavor, moistness (sounds inappropriate) and that \"if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" and ability to moisturize your sticky fingers leaving them smelling like fish for the remainder of your delicious meal.  Sticky and odorous fingers aside, it is highly recommended by yours truly.

My dining companions ordered the Mr. Ho's Burger (comes stock with meaty Chinese Sausages just for the ladies), Spicy Miso Burger (personallyI think it sounds moreinteresting calling it Mi So Spicy! Burger) and the Ronin Burger, and all seem satisfied with their menu selection.  So the consensus is that the food we ordered were yummy.  But I am in the camp that felt for a $10-$20+ burger price tag, you should be able to walk out satisfied, not wonder over to Archi's or Jollibee or drive over to Anime Ramen for dinner part 2.  Just sayin'

Decor/Ambiance:  4/5  Felt more upscale, even without the dim lighting.

Food:  4.5/5  NoM nOm noM Nom!

Service:  4.5/5  Good!

Price/Value:  3/5  Tab could add up fast if you have high metabolism, eat like a growing teenager or on the LV No Buffet List for threatening the profitability of buffets and other AYCE establishments (you know who you are)

Parking:  4/5  Better odds of landing a decent parking space here than hooking up with one of the Anime Ramen girls (already factored in enticing them with Panda Pocky).

4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day. Was pleasantly surprised at how tasty everything was!

Oxtail fries - crispy thin cut fries with a huge helping of oxtail toppings with an egg on top! Tasty!
Miyagi-san Burger - Burger was a little sweet from the seasoning. My fav burger
Shogun Burger - Intense! Fois topped burger + unagi as well. A lot going on!
Kiki's Burger - Mushrooms in the burger. Came out a little too earthy for my tastes

Walked out STUFFED!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place , the lonely bird is my fave with the fresh strawberry lemon aid  yummie, our server Daniel was great too , very on point !! Love this place !"}
{"text":"They won't let you call in an order without a credit card number.  I've never heard of a restaurant that does this... 
I called them while I was on my way home to pick up a few burgers but they said they needed to run a credit card first.  I said I was driving and unable to get my card.  They said \"ok I guess you can just order it when you get here.\". So I did.  I waited an unnecessary 15 minutes.  So stupid.  I'm never coming here again.  So sad too.  I just moved in nearby and thought this would be my go-to spot to grab food on my way home from work but don't want to fiddle around with a credit card number ever time I call in.  Oh well.  Their loss."}
{"text":"It's an ok burger. The bar area is odd. You sit at a big plastic looking wall. 
Too tall for the bar stools to fell comfortable. 
Ordered a med rare and received it rare. Just fries were okay. Asked for salt but didn't get any. 
Was over charged for a beer by 12.00 dollars! 
Had to wait to get server over to fix our check. 
Not a great experience."}
{"text":"So after so long I finally got to see what all the hype about was about, about Bachi Burger.

Burgers with Asian fusion, genius! Who doesn't love asian food?

Pork belly buns for appetizer = Yum! The bun finishes the taste to where it isn't too sweet, it's perfect.

My husband ordered the Miyagi burger, he said it was \"the best way to wrap up out date night\".

I had the Kiki burger which was delish. I wanted something simple but fixed to how I like it, medium well, mushrooms and Swiss, the patty still had an Asian flavor to it. As much as I wanted to put all of it in my belly, I couldn't finish it all, we will be going back to enjoy our burgers with beer next time, after my pregnancy. ;-)"}
{"text":"All I can say is I cannot wait until they open one up in Los Angeles!! The food was incredible!! We were in Las Vegas about 2 weeks ago. I should've wrote the review then, but forgot.
When we got there, there was about a 20-25 min wait. So worth it!! We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and had to come! Oh momma! We ordered the ox tail chilli cheese fries for starters. Holy shit, it was good! I had the Banh Mi burger which the patty was a mixture of angus beef, pork and shrimp. I didn't know how it was going to taste, but it was amazing.  I can't stop raving about the food to this day! If you go to Vegas, go out of your way off the strip and go to Bachi Burger. If you live in the LA area, I hear there will be one opening up on the westside. I couldn't wait for it to come here. Go there!!!"}
{"text":"I don't need to write a long one here.  It's very simple, Asian twist on American Fav.  The difference?  They do it better that any similar place I've eaten at before.

In short, Good Eats."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was well worth it. Great service our waiter helped us choose our food. The oxtail chilli cheese fries lived up to its awesome reputation. The manga burger is what i had and one of the best tasting burgers, my friend ashlee had the spicy miso burger and dusted it. We also had the duck bo buns that was amazing too..

love this place. so happy its 5 min away from my house"}
{"text":"Whoah, this place is right up my alley.

I am a big old white American dude (so I love burgers) and I also used to live in Taiwan (so I love Asian flavors).  This place combines both of my favorite cuisines in an amazing, affordable way.

I had the Ban-Mi burgers, it has pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, palm sugar, red oak lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, curry aioli, pickled veggies, and nam plah dipping sauce.  Try to order THAT from burger bar.

The bun was great, soft, on the inside, a little bit of crispness on the business end, and a good color.  The meat was cooked perfectly (they didn't ask me for a temp preference, but they definitely got it right).  Good sear, a bit of pink, and the meat really shone.  The thing was, all the Asian and American tastes just came together perfectly.  The little dipping sauce it came with really set the flavors flying.

This is now my second favorite burger in town (my fave is still at Daniel Boulud's)

I also ordered the cantaloupe milk shake (with boba).  When I lived in Taiwan, boba was about 20% of my diet.  I don't know if I would really classify the shake as a shake, it was more like papaya milk found throughout Asia, but it was amazing.  Perfect summer drink.

Best thing about all this?  The prices were fantastic.  $7.50 for an amazingly constructed burger (doesn't come with fries, but the $3.50 truffle oil fries were also perfectly crispy, with the warm, smooth center that all fry places should aspire to.)"}
{"text":"Boy would I kill for a Bachi's in the South Bay.

 My visits to Vegas rarely include venturing off the strip, but a good friend of my boyfriend suggested this place. I was not in the mood for a burger AT ALL, but the second I looked at the menu I was sold. 

Service was great, and everything on the menu looked so good it was extremely difficult to decide what to get. 

I eventually (reluctantly) decided on the Kalbi Burger which did not disappoint. Kimchee is the best condiment on the planet IMO and having it on a burger was an awesome addition. (I've had it on hotdogs and it's also thebomb) My boyfriend ended up ordering the Miyagi burger and it had such a balance of flavors and the onion rings on there were seriously perfect. 

All the buns on every single burger were fluffy and light and held up to the size and juiciness of the hamburger. 

Also order the salt and pepper fries because those things are legit crave-able. So crave-able that when I got back to the bay I immediately went to the grocery store and grabbed similar ingredients and attempted to recreate them at home. 


Stop at Bachis, order something, be happy. 

Easily one of the best burger experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. Had the foie gras and unagi burger, one of the best combos I've had. The oxtail fries were great too. Did not try any of the ramen, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"great place, fits the hype.  definitely would recommend. all you have to do is look at their menu to realize its filled with tons of gourmet choices."}
{"text":"Y U M M Y!!!! Their burgers are juicy, succulent, and absolutely original!! We started off with:

Oxtail fries: This is more like chili fries with oxtail bits in it...to be honest I wasn't a huge fan. Plain unseasoned fries with chili and dry bits of meat...ehhhhh it's okay. I would rather go for regular fries next time.

Sweet potato fries (garlic truffle): I've never tried garlic truffle SWEET potato fries before...so it was interesting. I think I prefer the garlic truffle on normal fries, but it was a good experience. Regardless, the fries were cooked well and overall well received.

I can't really go over all the burgers, but everyone loved their burger and I could see messy juices running down chins and onto tables...banh mi burger and Mr. Ho are some MUST TRYs. If you have a smaller appetite, then go for the steamed buns. There are 3 dinky little buns that still taste great, but like I said...just smaller portion (definitely not for Hungry Hippo Me, but to each their own). 

I can't wait to come back during my next Vegas trip and try more of their delicious burgers! DEFINITELY a must have!"}
{"text":"Always amazing...as all Bachi Burgers are! We ordered:

Shishito peppers: It came with a sweet sauce and it was smokey in flavor with a bit of FIYAH! as you get closer towards the stem (those sneaky seeds...) absolutely amazing...especially in between bites of burger!

Kurobuta sausages: Tasted very similar to hot dogs, yet at the same time, not quite. Very salty and sodium-filled, if you like extra savory apps. The mustard that came with it def cut down on the overwhelming saltiness and made it much more delightful though.

Kiki burger: I love shrooms (no not those kind!) and this really made my day. Delicious, juicy patty, oozing with deliciousness, topped with equally appetizing medley of mushrooms (all types!). I killed my burger within minutes! Yummiest burger ever!!

I had a great experience here, just as I did at the other location, and I can't wait to be back! Definitely a MUST-GO when you are in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner here during a work trip to Vegas. While I was a little worried that I would find the place overrated, the photos beckoned that I try it. What I ordered:

Spicy miso burger: meat was cooked just as I had ordered it. The condiments really made the burger, and overall it was just delicious.
Salt and pepper garlic fries w/ chili aioli: nice complement to the burgers. I have this thing with fries where I get really dissatisfied with boring and \"typical\" tasting fries. This was definitely not the case. They weren't the best fries I ever had, but they definitely had \"character.\"

Service was also very attentive. When I'm back in Vegas, I think I'll return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Stay away from this store.  They gave me the absolute worst service of my life, and told me that I'm not important as a customer.  They said I should have known that it would take over an hour to get a burger.  Maybe if the line was out the door, but there was no other customers in line in front of us.  Yeah the store was fairly busy, but not over the top.  Lot's of other problems like the bathroom that hadn't been cleaned etc.  But my vote is 0 for this place.  I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"Second time i went to bachi each time hopeing for the best. starters each time where cold fries that are cold suck i dont know why all the servers their and they cant get the food to you while its atleast warm kitchen is no more then 20 feet from the farthest table . I got my brother a peanut butter milk shake it was good but it was hotter then the truffle fries i brought it up to my other brother and he thought it was weird that they had warm milkshakes . When our burgers came i was the only one to get med rare at the table and it was med almost med well my med rare was but into some one at my tables set up and my burger also didnt have all the toppings for it i asked the waitress and she said oh its just a small layer i took apart my bugers and said where is it .I hate places like this gets good reveiws and you check it out and its Crap People have higher standers Big Dogs Is way better their servers are nicer and burgers are better and have micro brews their"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while and finally did; i was not disappointed!  We each got a burger, hubby got a wagyu burger and added his own toppings and i got the miyagi burger and we got the oxtail chili fries. The burgers were really good and so were the fries. The fries had great flavor with a kick of spiciness to them. The only thing is that it was a little more expensive than i would've liked, it was $50 (before tip) for 2 burgers, shared fries and 1 iced tea. Will we go back? Absolutely!  Just not often because of the price."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch and ordered their vegan burgers. Hands down, one of the best vegan burgers I've had! It was delectable..so full of flavor! Their sweet potato fries and garlic fries were awesome as well!"}
{"text":"went with friends and they all had fairly tame burgers.  I ordered the Shogun burger (Wagu beef, foie gras, unagi, poach pear, and the kitchen sink).  I thought u must be a genius to make this combo work.  It tasted like a bag of take-out that all got tossed together when their containers opened accidently in the bag.  Yes, I knew the job was dangerous when I took it, but it should be taste tested prior being placed on the menu."}
{"text":"Korean fusion at its finest! It is really no wonder to me that this place has been reported to serve the best burger in LV. The burgers here all are so amazing with diverse flavors yet still maintain the classic burger necessities of a quality tasting patty sandwiched between a great bun. I am in love with the buns here thats for sure. They are fluffy, moist, crispy, and buttery heaven. I think part of the reason why i really love this place is because I love Korean food and all that it offers with spicy and diversity in the food. And I love burgers so its the best of both worlds. 

I think my favorite burger on the menu has to be the Miyagi Son. It provides a really simple flavor that really packs a punch! The Ronin is a classic as well. They also let you mix it up and customize your burgers so if you're feeling like kimchi on your burger, go for it. 

The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must in my opinion. Obviously, anything with a fried egg and garlic aioli on it is going to be delicious but really the flavors on these fries are unreal! They also have a great selection of boba teas if you feel like getting your boba on!"}
{"text":"Holy huge! Share a burger! Got the truffle fried - they were meh. Maybe just a bad batch? Got the spicy miso burger and subbed the wagyu beef - it was delicious! Staff is friendly and helpful. I also like that they use real ramekins for all the sauces and they have a lot so that they don't waste all that plastic:)"}
{"text":"Bachi burger, oh my have I heard a lot about you. Friends of mine rave about your burgers and eat you (burgers that is) each trip to Vegas. 
With all that being said I knew I had to, just had to try your food. 

First off, I need to say that I will try it again and try sow thing different!
So I made a take out order of the wagyu burger with lettuce, tomato & onion with an order of fries. 
The fries were shoestring style cut and ok, maybe if I eat in then they would be crispier. 
Now for the burger. Ordered it med, which it was! Nice thick burger sandwiched between a delicious bun. However, it had no taste. I know the meat is the star of the show but it had no seasoning. Now I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this or not so I'll have to try again but for a first experience....disappointed! 
I hope that the flavor doesn't just come from all the different sauces or specialty burgers, the taste of a  plain burger will set standard for their other burgers. 

I plan on giving it another try next time I'm in Vegas, hoping for better."}
{"text":"service isn't anything to shout about....
the oxtail fries were a little disappointing...
but the burger was tasty, the bun nice and fluffy but crunchy on the ends w/a nice toast on it.  the ronin burger was a little too sweet, but the miso burger hit the spot.
not worth the drive AT ALL.  stay on the strip and get a burger just as good w/o a $50 cab ride."}
{"text":"Update and upgrade alert. 

I finally made my way back to Bachi after nearly two years and I was pleasantly surprised. We came here for lunch and they were extremely busy. We waited for about twenty minutes before we were finally seated. 

I decided to order the Kalbi burger this time around. I was enticed by the kim chi and it definitely delivered. The meat was perfect flavor and was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the pickled cucumbers quite a bit on the side as well. The bun, which is usually my biggest sticking point for finding a great burger was soft and delicious. My friend's burger was a little on the undercooked side, but still looked good.

Service was a little lackluster and that's the only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars. We waited quite a while to order, then another agonizing wait for our food and then when they finally brought our check, it was incorrect. Another long wait for them to rectify that and we were finally out the door. I wish they came by with refills a little more often as well. Service was friendly, however. I'll definitely be back, but I'll make sure I'm not in a hurry when I do."}
{"text":"Its been a while since the last time I was here and I have already forgotten how expensive it was. My bill came $98 plus tip for 4 people with no drinks,  and the food was just ok. 

Around 2pm today (Friday) I walked in looking around to see if my party have already seated, I did not find them so I went to use the bathroom, I came out from the bathroom, went back to the front and ask one of the server if I could get a table for 4. The place is very small and had about 3 tables being occupied.  I'd say 4 young male and female employees, most of them are  gathering in the back and no one had greeted me until I asked. 

Our waiter can use some advice on how to become a better waiter. You don't say \" oh ya, he has one, he can hand it to you\" when someone ask for a menu. You just don't!

and... I was the only girl in my group, my order was taken last and handed me the bill at the end... what a treat!

Bunch of kids working here and can definitely use some guidance."}
{"text":"We still love it here. Food is bomb and the whole wait staff and manager are super awesome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"F@#$% In and Out, this place has the some of the best burgers I've eaten.  The peanut butter milkshake is the \"essence of peanut butter\", not sure how else to describe it.  Just expect a wait, since this place is not a hidden gem anymore..."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that has been on Triple D....at least that is my opinion.   I vistied the location on Windmill for lunch and will definitely go back.  

We were seated immediately and greeted by a friendly server.   Considering it was lunch hour rush, I was impressed with the expeditous service and the repeated attention by the server.

I ordered the Kalbi burger which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.   The bun was fresh, soft, and slightly sweet...but the best part was the bun to burger ration was perfect.   In no way did the bun overpower the beautifully cooked Angus burger.   The kim chee was homemade and full of spice.    The Japanese marinade gave the burger the right amount of flare needed to call it a \"BBQ burger\".

Overall, you have to try this place.   Fresh, homemade buns with a medium rare Angus beef burger that is juicy and flavorful....you can't go wrong by this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and oxtail french fries are always an automatic order. I tried the plantation tea on my last visit and its sooo good. You'll want to drink it all in one gulp, but pump those breaks, because there are no refills. Lame sauce. I can't complain about their burgers, they are presented well and are very tasty. They are stacked high so biting into them will be a bit of challenge but when you're starving the challenge is easily accepted. Like I said depending on your server, you'll either get great service or you'll get mediocre. Nothing bad enough to not make me want to return. But maybe when people from out of town want to try something new."}
{"text":"The Miyagi burger is was delicious! The wagyu beef was perfeclry seasoned! But what really pop ut this burger iver the top was the fried egg! The yolk kicks up the flavor the the meat! I can see the reason why is most popular!"}
{"text":"I went to Bachi Burger on  Friday evening. It wasn't very busy and we were seated immediately. Service was pretty good, no complaints there. The food tasted good, but the prices are a bit steep. I order a burger that was $12. It was very good, but it was also (almost) the cheapest. There were $18 burgers all over the menu. That's a bit steep for me and it didn't even include a side of fries or anything. The burgers were a decent size, but no one in my party of 4 had any leftovers, including my 9 year old sister. So obviously they weren't huge entrees for the price. And speaking of kids, the kids menu consisted of 2 items: an $8 grilled cheese and a $10 burger. My little sister ended up just ordering an adult $11 burger and added avocado (+$1.50). There were plenty of burger options that sounded amazing, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay $18 for a casual restaurant burger. So overall, the food was very good, but I don't see myself going very often because I personally don't like spending $15-20 for a burger. But if you don't mind the pricing, I have no complaints about the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a mixed review from me for a few reasons.

1) The menu does not indicate that shrimp is added to marinade sauces, kimchi, ground into patties, etc. LET THEM KNOW IF YOU HAVE A SHRIMP ALLERGY. I didn't know when I ordered the Kalbi burger so I am thankful that 2) happened.

2) I got a wrong burger (it happens everywhere, so I'm chill with it)! I felt bad for whoever's burger I got, because it looked delicious but I cut it in half and instead of the Kalbi burger with kimchi I found... bacon? The waiter was very quick to take it away to replace it, but when I mentioned my shrimp allergy he told me that shrimp was in almost everything! Did I not read the menu very well? I couldn't find a warning anywhere when I went online and skimmed it.

3) The replacement burger they gave me just had lettuce and the spicy mayonnaise on it. Turns out, the kimchi also had shrimp (a lot of kimchi doesn't have shrimp, so I didn't think to ask if it wouldn't have any shrimp) so instead of being given the option to change my burger, they just gave me a very plain burger.

4) The plain burger was decently moist, the bun had the right amount of crispiness. The spicy mayo was delicious!

5) Service was quick and good.

So for all that the burger was good and the fries decent (parmesan, truffle oil, something fries), the lack of clarity on their menu for shrimp related items left me very disappointed and almost sick. Decent and quick service but it left something to be desired when I got the wrong burger and then a slightly plain burger to finish off the night without any choice for a change.

*Update: Boyfriend suggested it after seeing it on the Food Network."}
{"text":"The staff were polite but the food took a while to come out and was over priced. We got a couple burgers and fries and it came out to over $40. The food was good though"}
{"text":"If you want a huge party in your mouth - Bachi Burger is the place to be.  There is absolutely nothing bland about their burgers. Simple it is not. 

I am embarrassed to admit it but I actually first tried Bachi the day after seeing an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  And I am even more embarrassed to admit that my husband and I ordered everything that Guy ordered and even we found it to be \"burger bomb.com\". 

We started with the pork belly sliders and loved it.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy.  The pork belly was more pork fat than meat, but that is what makes it so delicious (and dangerous).  

The oxtail chili cheese fries are also good and I am glad we tried it our first time.  I wish there was a half order because it is a huge portion. It is meant to feed a family. Regardless, we prefer the truffle parmesan fries and it is a much more reasonable sized serving.  I am not a fan of the sun dried tomato aioli that accompanies it, but at least the fries are flavorful enough that they do not even need the dipping sauce.  

The Banh-Mi burger is the very first one we tried and it was filled with tons of flavor.  I love the hint of lemongrass and ginger.  The curry aioli puts this burger over the top.  We have also tried the Kiki's burger, Miyagi San's grass fed Waygu burger, and the Ronin burger over our multiple visits and they have all been quite delicious.  My favorite, however, is still the Banh-Mi.  My only complaint is that whenever we ask for \"medium\", it always comes out well done.  

My kids also enjoy the kids menu of a grilled cheese or bachi burger, with fries and fruits and veggies.  Everything is delicious.  The menu is creative.  There are also tons of boba milk teas and milkshakes if you still have room in your belly.  

I love the decor- it is so modern and sleek.  The service has always been fantastic.  I have never had to wait for a table for lunch, but on fridays and weekend dinners- definitely expect to wait."}
{"text":"WOW. Just wow. I don't remember the last time I was so impressed and happy with a burger. 

I opted for the Ronin burger, my friend got the Miyagi burger and we split it so I can have the best of both worlds. I would get the Miyagi burger! Burgers are similar because they both have a fried egg, onion but the Miyagi burger's crispy onion rings and furikake compliments the burger well giving it more of a Japanese flavor. 

Also tried their house made sodas. SO good. Omg. I have never had something like that. It was a little fizzy and tasted so fresh. I got the Apple & Lychee. Refreshing, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. There's nothing like that here in LA :'( 

Oxtail fries, on the other hand, didn't really win me over. Yeah they were good but you honestly can't really tell it's oxtail. Just tasted like shredded meat to me. 

Truffle fries are good though and the sun dried tomato aioli is really yummy. Truffle fries are half the cost of oxtail so I'd say skip the oxtail and just get the truffle fries. 

Truly wowed by this place. I will most definitely come back next time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"A lot of friends have been asking me about my experience at one of the newest spots to grub in LV, so I thought I'd break it down for you J to the Y style... 

Location: It's about 7 miles off the strip. If you don't have your own set of wheels and want to split between 4 in a cab it shouldn't be too bad. I'd say maybe $30? Though, that is just one way... 

Wait: Came here on Wednesday night around 8pm. Not packed at all and seated immediately. 

Bathrooms: Always a line. 

Patrons: A lot of Asians. Go Figures. 

Parking: Plenty

Service: Not bad. Our waiter seemed a bit flustered at times and would often repeat itself but I'd chalk it up to a long day. 

Food:

1. Ox-Tail Chili cheese fries: Not impressed. Don't let the fancy name fool you. It was just ok and rather forgettable. Also, not a big fan of the cilantro they sprinkle on top. 

2. Ronin Burger: Contrary to what other people's Yelp Check-in suggestions may state you might want to re-think about your own taste buds for a second. Had two friends order this burger cause it was \"Highly suggested\" from the other yelpers they saw who ate there previously and they were both a bit let down. Big surprise... 

3. Kiki Burger: I ordered the Kiki burger and I actually really enjoyed it. I had a bite of the Ronin and it just didn't have the same kick as the Kiki... 

*If you don't want to splurge for their $22 Shogun Foie gras burger, do yourself a favor and get the Kiki burger. It's bomb. 

*The burgers are decent size for the price as well. Slightly bigger than an Umami burger and on par with one from 38 Degrees. 

*Jessica Y. and I are both concur that this Burger is great for the area but it isn't something new...Especially if you frequent gastropubs and eat burgers from 38 degrees, Umami, and Slaters. 

*Never fear Californians, my inside sources tell me that they will be in fact opening two new locations in the So Cal area in 2014. One will be on Sawtelle and the other in some place in Santa Monica... 

** Bachi Burger in Vegas is  definitely worth checking out once if you're in the area and if you're sick and tired of eating at buffets and if you don't feel like waiting 1 hr 1/2 for pan roast. However, it isn't ambrosia. Manage your expectations and you'll have a great and memorable experience. 

Cheers, 

Justin \"Kiki\" Y.

{"text":"This place is always busy. Everytime I've been in, I've never been disappointed. There is nothing on their menu that isn't spectacular. I also have a sick obsession with there in house made black milk tea. They are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Don't come in a hurry or hoping for good, hot fries.  Waited 20 minutes after appetizers were finished to even order dinner.  Ordered 3 burgers and 3 fries.  Burgers came out first and were delicious. 2 of the 3 fries came half way through the burgers. Third fry came out as we finished burgers. Waiter apologized both as he delivered first 2 fries and again as he delivered the very late third fry, but didn't stick around long enough to see we were just about finished. Tried the third order of fries and they were luke-warm. Very disappointing. Couldn't find our waiter to get our bill, either. We had to ask the hostess to help us. She could tell we were frustrated and asked if we wanted to talk to management. We said no, just frustrated and needed to leave for a show. Waiter came back, saw the almost untouched fries, and asked if we wanted a box. A good waiter would have offered to refund the fries, since he knew it wasn't delivered as it should've been, but he didn't. Another disappointment.  Hard to say we'll be back for the delicious burgers."}
{"text":"Save you're money and go to Wendy's (at least the chili is better there). 

The wait was ridiculous for starters. Packed in a crowed waiting area in full view of open tables isn't a great way to start your dining experience. When we were finally sat, a hurried bus boy drops two waters and disappears, he would be the only acknowledgement from any of the staff for over 20 min. 

When the waitress eventually showed up to take our order she informed us they were either out of items or did not stock such crazy hamburger toppings like dill pickles. 

The food arrives its sub par at best. You'll enjoy you burger better at any fast food establishment. The ox tail chili was reminiscent of the area it originated on the ox (Hormel had a better recipe), and I don't know what the \"plantation sweet tea\" is supposed to be but it damn sure isn't tea. 

Year another \"hipster db my menu is hip and cool cause we put crazy things on things that never should go together\" place. Again don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is essentially Bachi Burger.. I don't know why it's called Bachi Kitchen. Even called to clarify prior to going to the restaurant. 

Ordered the Misagi-san burger and it was super good! The onions and the egg make the burger. Also ordered the truffle fries and they were BOMB. Every burger on the menu sounded really good, had a tough time finally deciding on one. Food came out very fast, but we were one of 2-3 groups in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been to Bachi Burger a few times. I have tried the Spicy Miso burger and it was super delicious. After being exposed to ramen, I no longer have the burgers. lol I get the Spicy Miso Ramen with extra noodles and extra spicy. My boyfriend gets the same but regular spicy. We almost always take some home, which we don't mind because it's just that good! They also have this salted caramel milkshake that is amazing! Everything we've ever tasted is super delicious and fresh! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.

Tons of great reviews inspired me to try this overpriced burger joint.  I should have known from all the reviews from tourists saying they came here from the strip.  I suppose if you're used to boring overpriced food in Vegas casinos, this place is a step up, but with so many great choices in Green Valley just 5 minutes away, this place doesn't even make the bottom of the list of places I like to eat.  I won't be back.

The oxtail chili cheese fries, meh, I've had better.  What's all the hype?  Mediocre chili heavy on the beans and light on the meat.  Fries were run of the mill boring fries, and the jalapenos not spicy at all.

My wife had just a plain burger with mayo and onions for $16.  She liked it, but it definitely was not a $16 burger

I had the Shogun burger...it was gross.  I removed the overly sweet pears and it was moderately better.  Not a $26 burger for sure.  Way too sweet...

But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.  So if you're craving a juicy, meaty, savory burger, avoid this place."}
{"text":"I initially heard about this place from a friend who mentioned oxtail chili cheese fries and I was immediately intrigued. Sadly, I couldn't eat it during that trip, so on my next Vegas trip, I decided to make a stop here before heading to the strip. Thank goodness this place closes late because I didn't think we'd make in time from LA. This would be the first time I tried a burger with Asian infused flavors.

Food:
1) Ronin Burger was good, but not spectacular. I enjoyed the Angus beef, caramelized onions, the gooey fried egg, and the crispy texture of the coleslaw. However, along with the Miso Goma, Yuzu and Citrus Aioli, it was too saucy and it had too much sweet flavor going on in a burger. I actually prefer a more savory rather than sweet flavor on a burger.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg#7CC4LhQgNIOvut_ilHgPEg

2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries tasted just like chili cheese fries. The chili was surprisingly light for chili. I could tell that there was a little bit of a difference in texture, but the flavor of the oxtail wasn't obvious. If it oxtail weren't mentioned in the name, I wouldn't have known that there was oxtail in there. There definitely wasn't a noticeable difference enough for me to spend that money on it.

3) Truffle Fries were some of the best I've had, but the sauce was only drizzled on the top, so there definitely wasn't enough of it for the rest of the fries.

Service:
Our server was friendly; Food was brought out in a timely fashion; Refills were constantly given."}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because the food is still consistent and great. Other than that this had to be the worst experience I've had with Bachi Burger. Aside from a really long wait before even meeting our waiter, bringing us the wrong burger and informing us we'll have to pay for it still (even if it was a couple bucks more doesn't matter to me) But it still wasn't what we ordered, already fed up with the service at this point I agreed in hopes of just enjoying my meal with my father who was a first timer here. This wasn't really the impression I wanted him to get. 

I think next time I'll just head to the other location."}
{"text":"Great Asian flavored burgers. I like the Ronin and Kiki best. Very busy so arrive early! Much better prices than other high end burger joints in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the Ronin burger and was happy with it.  The highlight of the night were the Oxtail Fries....Yummmm"}
{"text":"There are 2 of these in Southern California. With that being said, don't order something you can get in California. HELLO FOIE GRAS.

Shogun burger it is. A massive burger with a patty made of wagyu beef, a slab of unagi, and a beautifully seared slab of fatty rich foie gras - OH HOW I HAVE MISSED THEE. 

I ordered mine the only way a burger should be done (medium rare, DUH) and it came out perfect. The beef was juicy, unagi was sweet, while the foie gras was decadent. It got messy and all over the place, probably why there's always a line for the bathroom. My friend even warned me that I should sit closer to the table when our food came. Sound advice. 

The parmesan truffle sweet potato fries were good, but not amazing. I am just a sucker for sweet potato fries. 

There was no wait for us when we arrived. It was a Sunday during lunch, but then again it was just 2 of us and we had no problems with sitting at the bar. Service was top notch, (although there was a slight sexist incident.. I was dining with a pescetarian so obviously he had a fish burger. When our food came, the runner gave ME the fish burger and the shogun to my friend. I said \"other way around\" and he said \"oh I just assumed the shogun was his because it's meaty and manly. EXCUSE ME!? *rolleyes I digress)  and I would definitely wander off the strip for a Shogun burger again."}
{"text":"I like their truffle french fries and crab burger.
I give four stars for today, because the fries weren't fresh..."}
{"text":"Three stars is not for the fantastic burgers because they truly are great but the obtuse way in which we were treated when we put our names down to wait.  I'm going to be back as I've been here before but tonight I decided I wasn't welcome for whatever reason and dined elsewhere.  Bachi Burger became Snooty Burger as I was talking to a hostess trying to get my name on the long list, the other host (or gasp maybe he was a manager) asked me if I would like a menu and I said no thank you. And then he proceeded to lean his body in front of mine because he wanted to talk to her and perhaps thought I was flirting or something?  Not sure but I still hadn't got my name put down on the list in the midst of all this.  He shot me a dirty look and called her away to the middle of the restaurant, berated her on the floor for what I can only gather was some seating slight and then came back himself to ask me if needed something. To which I replied, yes, I needed to make sure I had my name on the list and to tell him that was all I was trying to do and proceeded to tell him how inexcusably rude his behavior was. What a putz.  I hope a great name like Bacchi Burger has secrete shoppers to let them know how their staff is acting when they aren't around.  But the Burgers, some of the best in town.  I guess I'll just eat at the other location they just opened instead."}
{"text":"When I found out that Bachi Burger had a $25 Shogun burger, it was so sinfully delicious sounding, that I had to have it first thing once we arrived in Sin City.

Having arrived at almost closing, around 10pm, we were no longer allowed to eat at the restaurant, so I ordered my $25 Wagyu and foie gras burger to go.  The AC was broken on this particular night, as was the bathroom.  As soon as you set foot inside, we started sweating as if we were in a sauna.  I waited for my order to come out.

Once it came out, I took it out of the box to take pictures.  I said to myself, I might as well scarf this thing down; and so I did.

I don't know if it was because I was sweating while eating the the burger, or because I was being rushed, or because it was in a to go box, or whatever it was, it was a bit overrated.  It was good, but when eating a delicacy, you probably need to eat this thing on a plate, and eat it slowly to enjoy and savor the flavors ingredients.

The bread was great (mildly sweet with a glaze), the meat, well it is Wagyu and of course better quality, and the foie gras was nice, jello'y and fatty.  A small bed of lettuce gave it a bit of crunch and healthiness.

I've also had a fish sandwich here on another occasion.  That time I was severely dehydrated and so it got in the way of my enjoyment and being a connoisseur.

Next time will have to eat here in normal conditions/circumstances."}
{"text":"The taste of their burgers didn't match the high price tag at all, I'd rather go to In-N-out or shake shack. The drinks were awful as well, both the milk shake and stawberry soda were the way too sweet. The service was slow, It took about half an hour to get my milk shake...Never again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Be prepared to be a bit clueless while perusing the menu, so many interesting items you've never heard of (thai sweet tea?). Interesting fry variations. A bit pricey but reasonable considering the ingredients and effort in the presentations."}
{"text":"We used to come here and everything was great, but there most recent trip was not so great. We came after playing at glow zone and as soon as we came one of the waitresses looked frustrated and told us it would take 20 minutes for her to clean a table that had no guests sitting in it. The entire party was so tired and we had 5 of us at the time so we just decided to stay because we were already there. After a very long time we finally seat and the same server came and asked us for our drink order. We never got our drink orders until after we were almost done with our food and we had asked multiple times to different servers. That made everyone mad but what could we do? We got our appetizers which was truffle fries and regular fries that was okay, but didn't get those until 30 minutes after we ordered it. Then 30 minutes after that half of our food came out. I got the miyagi San burger which was good that's why I gave the two stars, but most us were finished with our food and we noticed one person never got their order! That made me very angry. So many things had already taken so much of our time plus we were really tired and now one member of our group Head waited over an hour and a half for their plain burger with tomatoes and lettuce? I was very disappointed to say the least with their service that night."}
