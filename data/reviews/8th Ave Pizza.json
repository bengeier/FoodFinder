{"text":"When this place opened it was wonderful. It slowly declined to the point at which we gave up on them. In the spirit of nostalgia we finally ordered again. We ordered a pepperoni and extra cheese pizza. On a smallish large pizza we got 17 pepperonis and shuddered to think about the amount of cheese that the people that didn't ask for extra cheese got. When we called and spoke to the manager she succinctly told us that all toppings are standardized and pepperonis max out at 20 per pie. That's 2&1/2 per slice. That's far too few. This company's M.O. is the same which dictates how many pickles and how much ketchup McDonald's puts on a hamburger. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! BUY PIZZA HUT OR GRUBHUB METRO PIZZA!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic is all I can say.  I drove 20 minutes for this and I will do it again. Linh,  thank you. Doesn't get better."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I ever had! I ate 2 pieces because I was starving and threw the rest out.  I don't recall ever throwing pizza away. You can always just stomach it if if you don't really like it but this was just gross! Soggy, soggy through most of it. I had mushroom and bell peppers. There were 6 times more bell peppers than mushrooms. I think they used one mushroom on a large at most. I like pretty much ANY pizza so the fact that I threw this out says volumes! I would have enjoyed a frozen pizza from the grocery store more!  It really sucks too because I wanted to believe the good reviews on here because its so close to my house but unfortunately, I have to side with the bad!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken salad was disgusting - chicken was fatty and tasted straight out of the packaged deli section at Walmart. Also, it is advertised as coming with carrots and cabbage. Mine had neither ingredient.   Pizza was good. I won't be back though."}
{"text":"Rude assholes run this place . Pizza is ok .  Why all the rat traps outside the building ? I wonder !!!! If there are rats running around outside I'm sure a few have gotten inside too. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My buddies and I were on the way home from a Vegas trip.  Bad traffic so we put in \"pizza\" for search.  Ended up at 8th Ave Pizza.  The service was incredible.  Very friendly staff and obviously local ownership.  I am happy to support any small local business.  The pizza was good and the ingredients were obviously fresh. I would give the food 3 stats and the service 5 stars, hence the 4 star rating.  I will go back again next time I pass through!!!  Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to complain about regarding 8th Ave pizza, actually we really like these guys!!  The pizza is good, as good as you can do for this neighborhood, that's for sure. It's tasty sauce and high quality cheese and crispy crust. I'd like a little more chewiness, but it's hard to do with the water in Vegas and only a very few guys have figured it out.   The wings are really great, properly sauced (lightly) and crispy. Ranch dressing is damn fine as well. I wish they'd throw a couple celery sticks in with the wings, however. It's tradition. Salads are good too.   Bring the price of a pizza pie down two bucks and this place would get five stars. I can eat half a pie easy, they are small!!  All told, Southern Highlands is better off with these guys here."}
{"text":"Well pizza is still tasty and now the service is better!!!  Btw i love the chef salad (i know its really simple but...)  sorry i just can't give 5 stars because of my live of italian pizza.  Good job guys."}
{"text":"Any restaurant can have a bad night. Give them a second chance for those not happy. This pizzeria is probably one of the better ones in vegas. pizza and chicken wings were outstanding. they are opening a new pizza shop. Proof enough they got their act together."}
{"text":"Great pizza from a unique little shop.  Dine-in service has always been great. Fast delivery times as well.  This isn't a huge chain, so the pizza is not identical each time- but it is always delicious. Highly recommended for southern highlands."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  The pizza was cooked all the way, Yay!  Crispy, thin crust, spicy pepperoni, mozzarella, and a sauce that pulls it all together.  Great pizza!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from 8th Ave Pizza numerous times. Have found it to be hot, tasty and the same every time. I wish they had a few more options for salad and things for the vegetarian but for the most part we are pretty darn happy to have them in our neighborhood. If I could pick one thing to wish for it would be a little more friendly on the phone!"}
{"text":"We love 8th Ave Pizza! Our son was just home for two weeks for winter break and couldn't wait to order their cheese pizza and wings. In fact, we ordered it twice while he was home. It's a great special with a great price.   We wanted to keep eating after we were full because the pizza and wings tasted so good! The ranch dressing is wonderful.   We have never had a problem with the staff. They have always been friendly and polite.   I don't understand how some SoHigh residents prefer the local Pizza Hut over 8th Ave. The last two times my husband picked up a pizza from Pizza Hut I got sick after eating it.  We will never order from Pizza Hut again, but will definitely keep going back to 8th Ave! Thanks, 8th Ave, for having a great pizza shop in SoHigh!!"}
{"text":"Its good thin crust pizza...leagues ahead of the Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  It's as good as Grimaldis as a point of reference at a more affordable price(5th star.) Though unlike Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, its best served fresh from the oven.  So leftovers are not really an option.   The pizza is delicious and simple to the core, isn't that what pizza is supposed to be?  Definitely the best choice for pizza in SH!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how long it took me to get over to a place right in the neighborhood.  I love NY style pizza, and this place really delivers the goods!  The cheese, pepperoni, and sauce were all of the highest quality, and the crispy crust was a pleasant change of pace from my other favorites.  The restaurant is pretty small, but comfortable.  They only do lunch three times a week (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), but when we don't feel like cooking, the delivery service, close proximity, and incredible prices ($10 14\" large cheese) will make this a new staple for the family.  If you live in Southern Highlands and have not yet checked this out, do so, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Thin crust, nice and crispy! Never soggy and will never droop when u pick up the slice!  The wings aren't very good but I love the pizza! Definitely the best pizza in southern highlands! Always friendly staff, and delivery is always on time with super fresh, hot, delicious pizza!! I call multiple times a week cause there isn't pizza in southern highlands that delivers to my house nearly as good as 8th Ave!!! 4 out of 5 stars!!(only because the wings aren't great lol. If the wings were hotter and crisper I'd say 5 out of 5!!!)"}
{"text":"The worst pizza ever! Microwave pizza would be a vast improvement! Bad food, bad service. Should be out of business !"}
{"text":"So, after moving here I decided to give 8th Ave a shot.  After all, the reviews are hit or miss, so I thought I would be the judge and try it out.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great and it was super greasy.  I don't love Domino's Pizza, but Domino's was better than 8th Ave.  I guess I will have to pray for a better pizza place in Southern Highlands than 8th Ave."}
{"text":"If you're like me and you like NY style pizza...piping hot, thin crust, stringy cheese, and a little on the greasy side, then this is the place for you! If you are looking for CPK (yuk) or a $50 pizza with foie gras and pineapples on it,  then go to Grimaldi's. This place is simple and delicious, and oh yeah they're wings aren't bad either. There's only two options for pizza in Southern Highlands and this is waaaaaay better than Pizza Hut! And a BIG PS to all the yelpers complaining about the guy who \"demands\" coupons...this is a small business and they probably want to track how many customers they receive by printing those pricey coupons. Every time I have called to place an order they always ask very nicely for me to bring in my coupon if I'm using one, and the one time I forgot, they gave it to me at the coupon price anyway. =) So, don't be a hoarder, just bring in the coupon! Don't worry, you'll get another one in the mail next week. ;)"}
{"text":"OK pizza and wings - tried it for the first time.  Not what I expected... especially when a guy came in the back room and started yelling at \"Vinny\" the pizza maker... very sad place, only 1 eat-in customer. Pizza looked poor and wings get a 6 out of 10.  Choose a local pizza chain inst"}
{"text":"Pros: great crispy thin crust pizza, tasty cannolis, good service, fair prices(minus the fries) Cons: fries are a little on the skimpy side portion wise, no bacon  All-in-all: Great place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and wings, besides the crust being rock hard and the pizza tasting flat the service was good but not all can make it on good service. The prices are high especially on the wings and really not worth it. IMHO Dominos and PH have a much better tasting pizza."}
{"text":"I order from 8th Ave regularly. I love their chicken teriyaki pizza and my kids love the plain cheese. We order delivery on a regular basis but also like to stop and eat in. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Just had 3 pizzas, wings, chicken tenders and cannolis for a birthday lunch.  Pizza was great.   I was surprised how tasty it was.  Thin crust and lots of cheese.  The cannolis were a great finish to lunch.  Not too sweet, fresh and very good!  I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and really fast. They have a thriving delivery business but the ambiance in the dining area is relaxed and friendly too.  When we first stopped in we were concerned because nobody else was in there but we decided to give it a try b cause we were hungry and already there. So glad we did!  Definitely one of the best pizzas in town!  Give them a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The pizza is better than SAMs clubs bake at your house pizza... So like 5/10 their ranch and fries are pretty good but that's not saying much,.... When we showed up the guy at the front took our order fast... And got it out pretty fast but that guy continued to yell at some girl that was in there not a customer or anything but he kept yelling to the point the girl was crying and arguing with each other... Eventually two members of the staff started yelling at this girl for I don't know what.... It just made the situation awkward. The food was ok for the price but the service was bad to say the least."}
{"text":"The guys were very friendly and the pizza was bomb! Chicken wings were bomb! And the lasagna was amazing. Good place to eat! And very clean thank you guys"}
{"text":"Never mind trying this place. I ordered 3 pizzas to go for a poker party at our house in Southern Highlands. At the end of the party we had 2 and half left. We ordered from pizza hut. The crust was stiff and just tasted flat. We had pepperoni at ir appears thay are using inferior products. We need a great pizza place in SH and this place is not it."}
{"text":"We have had pizza and chicken fingers delivered for a couple years now.....always fresh, always On time!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza joint in town.  Never disappointed. The Asian cashier is always on point. I don't think I gotta tell him my order anymore cuz I think he memorized it.  Good atmosphere and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Long is the best at making people feel welcome. The pizza was amazing too! I drove twenty minutes to eat here and will return as they don't deliver to Henderson. Oh how I wish they did! Great food and only rated 5 because that's my only option."}
{"text":"Horrible Service and Horrible pizza .... had to drive all the way  back with a simple return and the employees could not grasp the fact that I wanted a refund for my untouched salad . It was mind blowing . Besides that the pizza was NOT good ! Sooo much garlic and just horrible service point blank ... will never be back again ! Pizza shouldn't be this hard lol"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Simple menu, fast and friendly service and great pizza at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Going to be brutally honest with this review and hope the owners take it as constructive criticism to improve.   This is the first time that we've been here. Wanted to try it out since we pass here almost everyday.   After our first experience, it'll most likely be our last unless there's major changes.   We ordered our pizza and were told it would take about 15-20 minutes. well that time came and went. we ended up waiting nearly an HOUR for our pizza to come out.   We were hoping it would taste good. But it's a basic pizza. nothing really special about it. we also ordered the Garlic bread. we were told that they were really good. Sorry but it was very basic as well. i'd take little cesar's crazy bread sticks over that one any day.   that pizza was not worth the nearly 1 hour wait.   like i stated earlier, we will most likely not be returning here nor will we be referring any of our family, friends or followers here.   wish you the best."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. Close to home, but a little pricey. It is currently my boyfriend's favorite pizza place.The pizza is thin crust, slightly burnt, and nice and hot. The cheese pizza with pineapple is my half and my hunni gets pepperoni, jalapeno, and pineapple on his. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"We've tried a lot of pizza places and so far, 8th Ave is the super best!!! Killer thin crispy pizza and honestly, the wings are out of this world -- crispy and delicious. My husband's favorite pizza ever is a place called Prima Pizza in Gilbert, AZ... This place is very close to that taste and flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"These pizza is on point. Perfectly cooked, and just the right amount of cheese. High grade cheese used cause there is no grease. They have great wings and offer like 15 sauces to cover them in, similar to BWW. The ranch is amazing, no hidden valley here. My only issue with this place is the sizes of pizza they offer; it's either a personal or a large, nothing in between. Will be back!"}
{"text":"After 4yrs of living in southern highlands i finally tried this place. ..i always forget about this pizza place and noticed it's usually always empty. ... i wasnt expecting my pizza to be thin crust,  i ordered the Hawaiian pizza and 5pc \"hot\" buffalo wings. ..  First my pizza was just ok.... i dont really like thin pizzas it was again,  just ok..  My wings weren't even \"hot\" to be the buffalo hot wings, and  the fries were bland :(   When i called to place my order i can relate to those reviews saying who ever answered had no emotion, but he wasn't rude.  I went to pick up my pizza, it was ready on time, i wanted to add a drink and the guy working gave me a free drink. ..  Overall, i wont be back,  maybe people that like thin crust pizzas will enjoy"}
{"text":"I ordered because I got a flyer and I was bored with the place I normally order from. I won't order again for a few reasons. One I'm not a thin crust type of person. If you are then you might like it. Two, the grease was nasty! I soaked it up with a paper towel before I ate. Third, their prices are bananas! Not worth the cost in my opinion at all. They do have good ranch and steak fries. That's about it. Sucks because I like supporting non-chain places."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new pizza spot for my family, so I turned to Yelp. The reviews were good and the location was great. I order and pull up around dinner time on a Sunday evening. It was absolutely dead, literally not one customer. Red flag! Should've gotten back in the car, but I already ordered and I'd feel bad.   Service was good despite the fact that me picking up my pizza disrupted the cashier eating her dinner and taking selfies in the corner. The restaurant itself was a bit in disarray but it appeared clean and halfway decent decorated.  Price was great but when we get the pizza home and dig in it tasted like frozen pizza. French fries were very good, pizza was not. The next day...my 2 year old, my wife, and myself were all SICK. Stomach was still upset 3 days later. Find a different pizza joint."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good and has a thinner crust that I like. The ranch was bomb! I had to wait a little when I went to pick up but they gave me three free ranch to make up for it! A+"}
{"text":"So impressed! Just as good as Grimaldi's (if not better) but without the $25 price and much better customer service. I just found my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot! Great service and food. Went out of their way to make us happy with our order. Always nice to have a place go above and beyond, especially when they're right down the street"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time.....Ordered pizza wings 20 bucks.....At first I thought wow this place is really clean inside but it was deserted.....Now I know why... My wings were cold...they looked like they had been dipped in sauce like 3 hours ago then dried up.....I said its ok ill just put franks red hot on them at home....The pizza was just garlic and pepperoni....wow that was the worst pizza I have ever had...its thin crust but it tastes like a thin crust frozen pizza you microwave. The pizza sauce was just so bland and the cheese and pepperoni the same....I counted 12 pepperonis on my Large pizza. Not sure why they were stingy on the pepperoni. They did give so much garlic clumped all over the pizza I had to scrape it off with a knife. I have ate pizza almost everywhere in this town/country. I don't think I have ever had pizza that was literally GROSS. This pizza was so gross we tossed it in the trash (which is a first in my family) Going to brush my teeth after I leave my first negative yelp review about PIZZA in my life."}
{"text":"Meh. Cardboard pizza that delivers to Mountains Edge. We ordered a large supreme, personal cheese pizza, and 12 wings based strictly off of good reviews for this place, but we were just plain disappointed. First, it was $50 after delivery fees, credit card fee, and tip to the driver for a small amount of food. I would have been fine with the price if the pizza was delicious, but the pizza was mediocre at best. The second star comes for the second day when we reheated my daughter's cheese pizza and it was better cooked again, compared to the night before. The hunt for good pizza in the southwest will continue, but seriously don't bother going to Eighth Avenue Pizza if you like NY style pizza or Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizza, or pizza in general."}
{"text":"This place sucks do not go here. Staff is rude. Hire a new staff cuz they all have sticks up their ass. They dont answer their phone to anyone...ever. How are u even supposed to order a pizza? This is the worst greasiest pizza in the world. You will have the worst stomach ache from their poisonous food. No wonder they never answer their phones. This place deserves zero stars. Yuck"}
{"text":"To be fair this is my first order of delivery pizza at my new place in Southern Highlands and I feel like I had a fairly different experience.  - The woman who answered the phone was nice, not something I would yell from the roof tops as amazing customer service, but she was nice and did what I needed her to do, take my order. - Delivery was on time with the quote of 45 minutes, which mean it was delivered 15 minutes after they technically closed.  - I liked the thin crust, my pizza was a small with ham and black olives. Toppings were evenly distributed, maybe a little light on the black olives but that is probably just me cause I've been craving them for 2 days.   All in all it is an okay pizza, since delivery I did a take out and I have to say, I'm probably okay with a frozen one from Smith's if I'm craving pizza. After living 2 minutes away from Pizza Rock for a year, I'm a snob."}
{"text":"Solid tasting thin crest pizza that is consistent. Best pizza place in Southern Highlands. Like the other pizza places in the area, 8th Ave I would say is an order and go place. Cannot really go wrong on any of their combinations. Good prices, and even the non-pizza items satisfy."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place in Vegas.  Pizza took 2 hours to deliver. Was cold and tasted poor. The garlic bread was awful, ended up throwing entire thing away. So disappointed. Go get yourself a frozen pizza from the grocery store!"}
{"text":"They have horrible service, waited and hour for delivery then called them. The guy who answered was rude and said they were trying to call me on a number that was completely wrong and someone else's phone number because my card did not go through turned out they typed in the wrong card number. Was not polite or helpful at all even though it was all a bunch of mistakes on their end. If I could do 0 starts I would."}
{"text":"The place smelled like a sewer. Enough methane gas to make you sick. Pizza was tasty I will give you that,good sauce cheese & crust. But the smell and the attitude of the bald Asian guy wont be bringing me back! Really sad when you hope for something good in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"This pizza  is terrible. The crust is so hard it's like eating cement. It's supposed to be a thin crust pizza but it's just really a cheap crust pizza. The place is always empty for very good reason. Terrible food bad service and high prices."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza and wings for delivery. I picked up my pizza before and I got a weird vibe from the staff. They are very unpleasant, thought if I phoned it in I would get a happy tone on the other end.... WRONG! They need to hire delightful people to work the register and take the phone calls. This will be my last time ordering from them until my free pizza coupon is valid lol! Oh and the pizza's not all that bad! Definitely better than Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"A little high priced and out of parm cheese was sort of a big bummer.  Also $4 for a two liter of soda is a bit over the top.  The pizza is ok, but then they also aren't flexible on the promos they have (very strict around toppings).  Expressing my concerns a few times but didn't get the feeling they knew how to make it \"customer first\"."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was very good.  I think the extra topping prices are a little high and it would be nice if they had some more options but overall pretty good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Vegas!! Delivery is always fast and accurate. I don't really understand these bad reviews about service. We order from them about twice a month and the staff is always friendly and helpful! Great wings and awesome ranch dressing!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok if you like thin crust.  Chicken fingers with ranch were pretty good and I liked their steak fries.  My salad was a chicken Caesar and was made with some wilted iceberg lettuce, not too good but the ranch, which was $1 extra was pretty good.  They got us for $50 which was very overpriced so we probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"New to the area and wanted to check this place out since we had a coupon. Ordered pizza and wings. Both were ok, nothing outstanding. Employees were nice. I gave 4 stars because there was nothing to complain about. I do not think I would order here again though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint.  The pizza is always consistently very good.  I've been eating here for 6 years now.  The crust is nice and thin and crispy.   The cheese is excellent.   It takes good cheese to make a good pizza.  The people who work there are always very kind.  Thanks especially to Nikki!     I highly recommend this pizza."}
{"text":"First time having this amazing pizza. We were blown away. We were leery of ordering because of some of the reviews. Holy cow were they wrong. This place is awesome!! Yes, delivery is generally an hour. Plan accordingly. Yes, when you add fresh garlic you're going to get GARLIC!! I can see how some would think there's too much. We love garlic so there's no such thing. It was perfect for us. Yes, it's pricier than Pizza Hut. But there's a reason!! Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it because I really love independently owned and operated local businesses but it was average at best.  I ordered carry out with the Val Pak coupon for a LG pepperoni.  They got it done fast and it smelled terrific. But it was a bit greasy and the crust really wasn't what I expect in a NY style pizza.  Sauce tasted average and quite honestly Pizza Hut has more flavor in the crust/sauce.  Really can't recommend it. Grimaldi's is still the best in LV.  I haven't tried Red Rock Pizza yet but will compare."}
{"text":"We used to love this place when we first moved into the neighborhood 3.5 years ago. First they started making all of their pizzas thin crust. You can't even pay extra for their original thicker crust. Still tastes good just less pizza for your money. Kinda disappointing but not a deal breaker. Well tonight we ordered a \"large\" pizza and I swear even the circumference got smaller. Not a good value at all. Maybe times are tough and they are trying to make more money?"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good!  Both my husband and I liked the crust and the flavor of the cheese.  The wings were okay, too.  Nothing too special.  We enjoyed the small bistro feel of the inside tables and the service was great.  We had no complaints about the price, either.  The only drawback is that 8th Ave Pizza does not offer salads.  We pick up pizza, wings, and a salad once a week at a place close by and would love to switch to 8th Ave and support our neighborhood business.  But... without salads, we won't be making a change."}
{"text":"Im from the East Coast, so I have high expectations of my pizza.  This place is good.  Not GREAT, but I am happy to have a local small pizza shop that makes good pizza.   We bought from here a few times.  We got the white pizza, BBQ Chicken, and regular cheese pizza.  All were good, but our favorite was the White pizza.     Pizzas are a little small, BUT the prices are reasonable for them, so you can just buy 2 for the price of 1 elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family loves this place moved to southern highlands this year and this is the go to pizza place! Thin crust good sauce Good pizza period"}
{"text":"Pizza is average at best. Wings and fingers are not good, very small. Service sucks. I called for a delivery of 4 pizzas and guy on the phone couldn't care less, no emotion no thank you. Delivery guy the same. We order from here because there is nothing else nearby. I hope the owners read these reviews and make some changes to the service and the business would be better despite the so so food."}
{"text":"I love this place! We anxiously wait for 4pm to order our pizza.  Great food and nice people :)"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this place and live right down the street which makes this location so convenient for anyone living in Southern Highlands! Though many food spots have been opening up around the area, finding quality food and decent service are tough to find. Being a native New Yorker finding a good pizza is a struggle for me to put it lightly, but I've gotta say this place always consistently delivers a thin crispy crust on their pizza and great medium heat wings! I would definitely recommend this spot and they also send out coupons pretty often and take care of our soft drinks when we dine in. The majority of the staff is really friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I la la la love the crispy, thin wheat crust. It doesn't leave you feeling like you need to unbutton your pants when you are finished. Now if you do what I did and pile on pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, extra cheese and a side of ranch (by the way...they have fantastic ranch here) it kind of takes away the healthy benefits of the whole wheat crust...but I felt good about myself for just a minute.   Vinny and his staff are the nicest guys. The service is great (I was asked multiple times if I needed anything, how was everything, etc). They even sent out some cannolis for me and the monkeys....and they were darn tasty. So glad to have this within walking distance from my house. Now I know what to do if I have a day off and I don't feel like cooking. Thanks again Vinny...you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service! Decided to give them a try after a horrible experience at another pizza place near by. Very glad we did! The pizza is thin crust and delicious.  The staff was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Still a great little local pizza place.  My family and I have been eating 8th Ave Pizza regularly since my first review five years ago.   I believe I've only had one poor experience with the quality of pizza over the course of that time.  Overall it is a very tasty good quality thin crust pizza.  I don't eat wings, but my husband loves them and gets them often.  Also, just an FYI, the garlic sticks are crazy garlicky, almost like raw garlic. The employees have never been over the top friendly, but I don't think it's such a big deal like some other reviewers seem to.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm SO glad I didn't listen to most of these bad reviews. I was scared to try 8th Ave. pizza, BUT I tried it in March 2013 and I've ordered a lot of pizzas from here ever since and they are always FANTASTIC. I'm extremely picky and pretty sensitive to pizza; 8th Ave. pizza doesn't ever upset my stomach. The ingredients are very fresh tasting and I have never gotten a greasy one, we order pepperoni, mushroom and green bell pepper. The crust is the thinner chewy with a slight crisp type. This pizza is definitely a pleaser and not like cardboard at all. I am very picky and highly recommend 8th Ave. Pizza. We are regulars and can't stand the national chains.   P.S. the pizzas are NY style (thin crust)."}
{"text":"These guys are the best... Great staff ... Good thin crust pizza and their ranch is crazy good"}
{"text":"The low price makes sense given the mediocre pizza.  Watery tomato taste, cheese either not enough and/or lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of these reviews- the pizza is about a 6/10 but the staff is fucking awful.  They treat you like shit for no reason.  Every time I think pizza, while I'm at home, I think of this place- Then I remember how shitty everyone's attitude is that works there and I choose something else to eat.  Sorry guys. Be less douchey."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten there on several occasions. Only for delivery or takeout. For the most part the pizza has been okay and wings were okay also. On one occasion I got sick from the chicken wings and it is been very hard to go back there. My wife has again started ordering a pizza and salad for pick up but I will definitely not order chicken wings from there again the delivery has always been on time and everyone on the phone were very helpful and courteous"}
{"text":"I went in there to order a chicken sub. The service was quick and it was delicious I would highly recommend it. The cashier Maddie was really friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Other than Pizza Hut this is the only other delivery pizza spot in the neighborhood. Pizza and wings were fantastic! The white pizza, chicken salad, mozarella sticks were all less than desirable. Nothing I would order again. The chicken salad was comparable to a side salad with cold chicken on top, 1/2 small chicken breast at best . The mozzarella sticks were same quality of something I could have thrown in my own oven ( not the point of ordering out). The white pizza, just pass on it.  I'm sure we will order another pizza from here, but not because it's great and were craving it, but because it's around the corner and less greasy than Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I love pizza and am pretty picky... so it means something when I give a positive review on it!  haha   I have only had their pepperoni, but it is really good! It is a thin crust, New York Style. I did ask for more sauce on future orders. They put it on pretty light...   The garlic/cheese sticks are INCREDIBLE.   However, there is A LOT of garlic on there so now I request light garlic!  Much better!   I definitely recommend giving this local business a try!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place has bad reviews about both their food and service! We've ordered pizza here a bunch of times, and it's always been really good. It definitely has that back east feel. The white pizza is excellent, if you want something different. The service has always been great. They do answer their phone, they are polite, the delivery is fast, the drivers are always nice. My pizza always gets here nice and hot. We'll definitely keep ordering from 8th Ave!"}
{"text":"The staff is nice, and the food was regular. Like nothing really good but not bad either. Just kinda that place on the corner. I just tried it cause it was down the street"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I decided to give it a try as I like to support local small businesses.  I placed an order at 5:30 and asked it to be ready at 6:15.  I arrived 10 minutes early as I often do.  I received my order late, which is forgivable on a Friday.  I ordered a Margherita pizza, a Chicken Caesar salad, and Spicy BBQ chicken wings.  They said they were out of basil.  Odd, because someone could quickly go to Smith's and buy some.  I get home, and the Margherita pizza has tomato sauce and enough garlic for 3 pizzas.  Margherita pizza does NOT have tomato sauce.  Second, my caesar salad DOES NOT HAVE ANY PARMESAN.  NO CHEESE FOR A CAESAR??  It was made with iceberg lettuce, which I understand given the romaine scare.  But let someone know.  Lastly, the Spicy BBQ chicken wings had zero spice.  I did not want to post a review but there was no option on the website to email the owner.  Please make some changes."}
{"text":"Just tried the new Caprice Pizza. Can't wait to have it again!!! I would of expected to find a dish like this at a high-end restaurant at high end prices, but here we have it! I was even surprised to have an order of thick cut fries with home made thick and creamy ranch and even garlic salt set on the table. A great place to grab a pizza in our Southern Highland area."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place! It's nice to have something besides a run of the mill chain pizza place. All of the employees are very friendly. I recommend the white pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is always on point (this is coming from a native New Yorker too/still not the same but good!) We had one order/delivery snafu with Grubhub but 8th Ave Pizza made up for it by personally delivering our order with an additional drink and dessert. They care about their customers and will be getting our business again soon!"}
{"text":"this pizza is really good and I don't even understand how someone could complain about the service. almost every time I go in there I walk out with something I didn't pay for. love this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing!! I always get pepperoni pizza and this place is one of my favorites in town.   As for the bad customer service that everyone has mentioned, it hasn't happened to me. The owner was friendly."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre pizza - nothing special at all.  Overpriced, too.  Their \"large\" is 14\" and they charge  $14 for a 2-topping pizza.  When I complained to the manager/owner, he said their sizes and prices were comparable to Pizza Hut.    They're right around the corner from me, but I won't eat there again.  We will stick with Joe's NY Pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible. The crust was hard as a rock and the guys running the business were pretty clueless. No basics like beer or  iced tea to drink either. Even though not busy tables weren't clean.   I do not reccomend"}
{"text":"Thank you for reminding me why I make my own pizzas. I was excited that Southern Highlands was getting a pizza joint besides Pizza Hut. But 8th Ave fell short of my expectations.  I ordered a whole wheat pepperoni and tomato and a bbq chicken pizza. They were thin, crispy, and flavorful. But they were borderline burnt and overpriced for the size. Call me cheap, but 2 large mediocre pizzas for $32 is steep in my opinion. I ordered take out but the ambiance was dead and depressing. It could've taken cues from HGTV and made it look more inviting. But I liked how they offer whole wheat option. But $2.00 per extra topping, including veggies? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  We had a thin crust (regular) pizza with pepperoni and mushroom.  This place is better than the pizza chains nearby like Pizza Hut.  However, it is not as good as Grimaldi's.  I don't know about the other reviewers, but the asian guy at the front was really nice and gave good service."}
{"text":"The pizza was tasty, but that's about it. I ordered a to-go order asking if they could add red pepper flakes cooked into the pizza. But being that that was a fairly tall order, they decided instead to hold off on the pepper and instead move all my toppings only to one side of the pizza. So I got 5ish slices of pretty decent food, actually."}
{"text":"Place is in a newly developing area that's pretty scarce. I think that's why there wasn't anyone in the restaurant. We were looking for something quick to take on the road home with us.   This place offers thin crust only (which ends up crisp kind of like a cracker and probably thinner than a cracker) - I do like a crisp crust but I know some don't and won't like this pizza at all. We had the garlic sticks and margarita pizza. Both were packed with lots of roasted garlic. If you're not a fan of garlic, I'd suggest you pass on anything that has \"garlic\" on the list - think we ate a whole clove of garlic!!  The pizza sauce that comes with the sticks is a bit thin for my liking. I like my sauce thick. This was more like tomato sauce.  The sticks are made from the same dough as the pizza so super thin, tons of cheese, and like I said earlier tons of garlic."}
{"text":"I get their coupons in the mail every week for $8.25 Large Pizza.  I called in to place my order for pick up.  As I got there the cashier said $8.25 with the coupon.   I told him that I didn't bring the coupon as I didn't think the coupon was needed.  He charged me $12 for a terrible pizza!!!!!  TASTE like garbage!  I would rather of had Little Caesars for $5.00 or a frozen Digiorno!!  F this place!  I will never spend another $$ here!  Never again I will go to this s*it hole!  Asian guy in the front needs to learn some customer service skills."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza.   My personal favorite is the pepperoni!  Staff all very friendly.  I've picked up and I've had delivered and only reason I'm not giving it 5s is because you normally have to wait about an hour for delivery for a simple order.  Otherwise, everything is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. Idk what's going on here with ppl posting bad reviews about their pizza but come on people!!! I'm from Brooklyn New York and I'll tell you their pizza is one of the best I found in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza nothing special and a little over priced.. chicken strips are good and fries but I don't see my self ordering this again hope this helps.."}
{"text":"We brought a party of around 20 people into 8th Avenue Pizza to celebrate a birthday.  The 8th Avenue team was friendly, accommodating, and went far above and beyond to ensure that we had a great experience...and we did!  Oh yeah, and the pizza happens to be AMAZING!  I highly recommend this hidden gem to anyone interested in great pizza and great customer service!  THANK YOU, 8th Avenue!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! the staff is very friendly. Both times the pizza was cooked perfectly, exactly what we ordered. Not sure if he was a manager or not but my first time there I was deciding what appetizer i wanted to try, I finally picked he charged me and when the food was ready he went ahead and gave me a free order of mozz sticks anyways to try. The second time while I was waiting for my pizza the guy gave me and my fiance a free soda.  The people hear give great customer service and the cooks are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Do not order from this place unless you like having to wonder if your food will actually show up or not. As it was, the 70 minute time was a little excessive for being less than 5 minutes away.  I ordered online and the food never showed up, would be 0 stars if that was even possible. Tried to give a local place a try, but looks like I'll just go back to the bigger chains since they actually show up and in a timely manner.  I guess this place has enough business to where they don't need mine.  Thankfully my credit card doesnt ask questions about charge backs for small amounts."}
{"text":"Pizza was hot and had some real good flavors.  Just a little pricey for a togo pizza, better then Pizza Hut, just not $11 better!  I most like will go back just not any time soon"}
{"text":"New to Southern highlands, I decided to try this pizza joint. What a mistake!!! This is absolutely the worst pizza I have ever tasted in my life!! I ordered a Margherita and a supreme plus box of frys. The Margherita was caked in garlic chunks, had very little cheese and hardly any basil!!! Taste horrible!! The supreme looked like the Red Baron kind you purchase at Smiths, but Red Baron taste a million times better!! The frys $3.75 for like 10 frys and their frozen steak frys you buy in the big bag from again Smiths for like $2 bucks. 2- pizzas and frys $35 bucks, I feel so ripped off that I had to write a review. I'm all for small business being successful but this place is the worst!!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying the Pizza, got 1 topping (pepperoni) pickup special for 8.99. Very tasty but very greasy. Still will order again, the crust was nice and thin the cheese stretchy and would prefer it to our nearby pizza hut. I like ranch, don't love it but they have the absolute best ranch EVER!! The guy at the counter gave me the ranch for free because it was my first time there. He was also very polite and welcoming. Drove there the other day just to purchase ranch but they were closed :(."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest place. And just ok but it's convenience to hone. Imagine how much more business they can do if they are nicer or actually deliver when it's supposed or have it ready as promised.  So sad it's always so behind and have teenagers working in kitchen. Especially with attitudes. Oh yeah and pizza is mediocre. It's only convenience people go"}
{"text":"Just moved in close to this place. It was between Pizza Hut and here. I thought id give it a try. Not reading all the reviews and basing it off it's overall rating 4 1/2 out of 5. I called to place my order and the gentleman on the other side was not friendly at all, I fact, we was a dick. It was like prying teeth to get any info out of the prick. Picked it up and got the same attitude from the guy. Only gave me 1 ranch for 10 wings. I had to buy 2 more at a dollar a piece. Pizza was just decent. Nothing special and it was overpriced. Will never return due to the big asshole up front."}
{"text":"This place makes delicious pizza! We use their delivery service and it is always hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been searching high & low for a good pizza shop. Having grown tired of Pizza-Hut we decided to try 8th Ave. To tell you the truth, I REALLY wanted to like this place! But the truth of the matter is, we were very disappointed. The crust was paper thin and stuck to the parchment paper underneath which had to be peeled off.  The toppings fell off the pizza as the slices were being served. It tasted very bland. As a matter of fact, I compare it to a supermarket frozen pizza. I gave this place two stars because the service was good and the guy taking our order gave us two free drinks. Sorry but we won't be coming back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Order from here a couple times and it's been great. However tonight was a different story. Ordered two large pizzas for delivery, cost $30. Not the best value but you get what you pay for right? NOPE! Apparently they \"changed their recipe\" their typical pizza now comes \"thin crust\".  Thin crust? The cheese is literally sitting on the parchment paper in the box. I called to make sure we didn't order it incorrectly, the response I received...yeah we changed it and? Wow ok. 8th Ave Pizza hope you enjoyed the last $30 I'll ever give your business."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today just to try something new. Cashier was really helpful, she explained the menu in detail. We ordered the 8th avenue supreme pizza, everything there is thin crust. Got the pizza to go and was skeptical from some of these reviews but the pizza was actually really good. Five stars for the pizza and great service."}
{"text":"Gave these guys a second chance tonight and I'm sorry I did. Ordered two pizzas and chicken fingers. First of all, their prices were raised from their already high prices for small pizzas.   They charged 50 cents to sub blue cheese for ranch and didn't honor their usual large cheese pizza deal.   To top it...they screwed up my order...again. Ordered a plain cheese pizza for my picky son and it came in as a pepperoni. The second pizza did not have evenly distributed toppings.  On the phone, the guy justified the mistakes, did not say sorry, never offered money back and said he would only make a new cheese pizza to replace the pepperoni. He said I could come in to get it and did not offer to have it delivered. When I asked, he said it would be 45 minutes. I came in.   When I got there, again, no apology, no refund offer. I told him it would be my last time in here after giving them this second chance. We conversed for a minute and I left. I'm done with their overpriced, poorly prepared product."}
{"text":"The kids & I ordered Pizza, White Pizza for my daughter & I, and a BBQ chicken personal pizza for my son.  We wish we had ordered a large BBQ Chicken pizza because it was the best pizza we have ever had. We ordered pick up and it was ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Note:  I tried this place twice, as I wanted to make sure it wasn't a one time crap pizza fluke.  Since this place is less then a mile from my house, I was hoping this place would be good or at least decent.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  For $16 I got a large pizza with burnt crust.  It was a very thin pizza without a lot of toppings or flavor at all. Definitely overpriced.  You can make a much better pizza at home for 6 dollars.  Even pizza hut or dominoes would be preferable to this.  My question is why go to all the trouble and cost to open up a pizza joint and then make extremely mediocre pizza.  Heck, the ingredients don't cost much - pile them on at least if your going to use crappy quality stuff.  Very disappointed  in this place."}
{"text":"The food was ok. It took them more then an hour to get to my house and I live 1 miles from them.. probably won't be back for some time I rather have had dominos"}
{"text":"*WORD TO THE WISE* I dont know where these other people got their taste buds but 8th ave pizza was cheap in quality not price the lrg is only a 14\" which is a medium in most pizza shops. trust me ive worked delivery for a couple pizza shops in my life.the pizza was your standard cheap super greasy pizza about the same as in the grocery store freezer but the worst part of this place is the chicken fingers and fries ewwww not to mention the lack there of it looked like a 5th grader threw a handful of fries in the basket. if you have an option for a different pizza shop TAKE IT!! i lirterally just made this yelp account to specifically hate on 8th ave pizza lol. i live 2mins away from this spot and would gladly drive to a shop 10-20mins away including bootlegger, pizza my dear, grimaldi's, even grocery store pizza would be a beter choice. dont make the same $30 mistake i did and regret havin a medium pizza and 5 sticks of cardboarded chicken for dinner ha oh ya fries didnt even come with condiment i guess their delivery is like mcdonalds u have to beg for an extra mustard packet wow with all seriousness im a huge pothead and i still had to throw these chicken fingers & fries away, that shows how bad this $hi..t is."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from here because it was near my friend's new home.  Almost an hour after ordering delivery we had 3 crying young kids and no pizza.  We called and checked the status and did mention we ordered \"approximately an hour ago\" only to be corrected that it had only been 50 minutes and it would be at least another 5.  So we said, ok sounds good, and we waited another 10 minutes to get our cardboard pizza and over garlic laden breadsticks.  Within minutes the entire house smelled of garlic and even though me and my friend love garlic, it was still too much for us. My kids, despite being hungry only ate half a slice of pizza because it was too greasy even after we paper toweled off much of it. I had one bite of flat breadstick, but the seasoning was way overdone and just gross.  We actually THREW AWAY PIZZA.   Waste of money. Call another mom and pop shop if you're looking for good service, timely delivery, and want to satisfy some taste buds!  This place was a complete disappointment. Worst pizza ever."}
