{"text":"The service and food were fantastic. Calamari appetizer and beef screwers were my favorite but all the food was really good. All four of us loved it, going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Not only is this overpriced, the quality of the food was mediocre and the portions were small. Dry Pad Thai, My Mee Krob, which is chicken, shrimp and mixed vegetables sautéed in a sweet and sour sauce served 
over Thai egg noodles was actually a few morsels of chicken, no shrimp to speak of and what tasted similar to McDonald's sweet and sour sauce mixed with ketchup smothering it all. I had 5 bites and didn't finish.
I take that back, the coconut soup - Tom Kha - was excellent.
A group of 10 of us were here for a birthday, and they had dedicated two staff members to us that night, or shall I say rather, one wait staff, one High Pressure Sales person. Wow, I expect high pressure sales and up selling in many environments, just not for dinner.
We were basically told it would be ridiculous to order anything but the King's feast, which was waaaay too much food for what we wanted, and also cost $35 per person.   excessive when you can be full at other Thai places for a mere $16 pp. We were asked many, many, MANY a variation of this script below:
\"you'd like coffee?\"
\"no thanks.\"
\"I think some wine then.\"
\"no, thanks my beer is fine\"
\"another appetizer?\" (after already sharing a few between us). And then proceeded to repeat this convo with each one of us. EACH ONE!!! Arggh. Our friends saw my sister and I's eyes bulge out at the constant interruptions.
And then again the same convo at desert. We at first thought it was funny, but we dreaded her presence eventually because it was beyond annoying. Poor birthday girl, she felt bad for us.
that being said, they allowed us to bring in our own cake ($2 plating fee pp). And the owner did ask us how our food was briefly and we could've said something, but it just didn't feel like the time to bring it up, and no one wanted to deal with it. 
No, no, no. That's not customer service - it's harassment. Good thing her serving co-hort was absolutely silent.
Unfortunately, most of us, or maybe all of us, will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was OK but not great. Dishes were not that spicy and strangely very sweet.  Service was nice but kitchen took a long time. Very nice inside. This is a pretty upscale Thai place."}
{"text":"I'd like to review this as better, but the food - for the price - was not fresh and not very flavourful. 

I need gluten-free foods, so I called and they said they could accommodate. I was so pleased, and they said they could prepare salad rolls, pad thai, and two different types of curry and even some gluten-free calamari. 

So I picked up the food - it was really pricey for what I got - but I was very excited as I haven't had gf Thai for a long time. 

When I opened up the first package of pad thai I couldn't have been more disappointed - basic overcooked rice noodles with bean sprouts, and some egg and chicken and two freezer burnt prawns on top. No garnish no love in this dish... It was a sad looking state. Mind you, they said they couldn't use the regular tamarind sauce, so I moved on. 
- next was the calamari - I was actually sort of impressed; the calamari was tender, and flavourful - not a lot of spices but you don't need a heap when the food is fresh. 
- green curry chicken: the sauces wasn't very thick, the veggies weren't bad but it just lacked flavour, and spice
- red curry prawns: this was the worst - the prawns, again, where the overcooked freezer burnt prawns that you can get on sale at superstore for 2 for $10 - and they didn't even take the darned tails off so that was a whole mess. I'm not expecting fresh fish or seafood in Calgary, but really - if you are charging these prices, there should be an attempt at using fresh ingredients. 

Overall, I was very \"meh\" about this place. The ambiance was great, but as I was taking my order out, I really just got the food, and that wasn't worth the price. Recommendation: go here if someone else is buying, and don't set the bar too high."}
{"text":"I have heard of the King and I for several years and finally went in to try it out. I was not sure what to expect . I went with an open mind to experience this restaurant. We found the menu overwhelming with all the choices and I was not sure what to order and how to put it together for a good dining experience, so I asked the waitress what was good on the menu and she suggested to do the chef special. This means the chef put a menu together for you base upon the guess at your table. Our table had 4 guess. We had a appetizer, soup, and the main course was 4 other dishes from mild to hot. It included seafood, chicken, beef, vegetables, and of course rice. It was delicious. The service from I  walked in the door was outstanding.  look forward to going back for another experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, decent food, good service, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for our staff lunch for \"Festivus\". I had heard great things. I've been missing good Thai food  since moving here from Ontario-yes it exists in Calgary (not nearly as much though) but so far my experience has been mediocre food at really expensive prices.

The decor at the King and I is lovely....soothing and cozy. A little on the \"nicer\" side actually-I'd want to be in business casual if I was going again. The service was great-very attentive.

The food was good. A couple of our dishes were amazing (red chicken curry and some kind of beef curry). The rest was kind of average-good but I've had better. 
The real kicker for me is price. I don't mind paying a pretty penny for great food but in this case we paid a pretty penny for average food, smaller portions that just weren't warranted by the food itself. I'd consider going back for the red curry but for the price I'd rather take a chance on trying somewhere new. It didn't impress me or offend really-it was in that scary zone for restaurants of somewhere in between."}
{"text":"Thai food has become very popular in Calgary.....there are a few wonderful , small Thai restaurants around the city now and they share a few characteristics. ......tightly packed tables, spotty service and a noise level that prevents normal conversation. 
THE KING AND I .......is in a class by itself.   Great food .......Great service......spacious seating areas......and a much lower decibel  count than most others. You can actually TALK to your table mates without yelling.
Fail safe dishes that I recommend, 

Tom Ka soup

MEE Krob appetizer 
Pandulas chicken appetizer

main course dishes ....... ( there are too many to list )....some favorites
Chu chi seafood
panang Kai
a few curry dishes with chicken

desert......
coconut cake and coconut ice cream 

they also make a great cup of coffee and the Beer is always COLD.

this is the premier Thai Food Restaurant in calgary........."}
{"text":"If my brother didn't show me where this restaurant was, I would have walked right by it.

Please don't let the exterior throw you off from dining here. You'll be pleasantly surprised the moment you walk in. Upscale interior with quality food.

My recommendation is their Lamb Curry. This was easily the best dish we had here, and I will continue reminisce.

Quiet environment with plenty of space inside for larger groups. We had warm, friendly service by all staff."}
{"text":"I sure do love good Thai food and at The King & I, they sure do know how to make it right!

I've been a few times, and I've never had a bad experience. The service is always impeccable, the decor is undeniable, and the food is irresistable.

Although you'd rarely have room for dessert, I HIGHLY recommend trying their coconut ice cream. Seriously, Ben & Jerry's has got NOTHING on them!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I went to The King & I Thai Cuisine.  It is so close to my work and yet it never seems appealing enough for me to go back.  Ah yes, now I remember why I don't want to go back again.....I am paying way too much for what it is. 

Food is so-so.  Service is good.  Atmosphere is on par.  Price is too much for Thai.  

Food is actually quite salty.  I felt really thirsty after which can only mean one thing - MSG!  We ordered the Thai Sticks appetizer which is a tiny shrimp wrapped with a giant tasteless meatball deep fried.  It just wasn't good.  And the name definitely misleading \"Thai Sticks\"....more like Thai Balls to me.  For main course, we ordered the Pad Thai, Buddha's Delight and Moo Moo King.  Portion-wise is kinda small even for lunch."}
{"text":"Very bland flavours, not impressed. We got two different dishes and coconut rice (which barely tasted of coconut.) I felt they were much too expensive (about $22/ entree) for the quality of food. Will not be going back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Food and Drinks: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

The King and I is like a fine dining Thai restaurant. It is very non-traditional in the sense that you couldn't tell it was a Thai restaurant except for a small statue of a temple greeting you when you come in. It is very tidy and fairly spacious with divided areas; ideal for private parties. The staff was very accommodating for our 10+ group and the food came out in a very reasonable time. However, our  waitress wasn't really engaging. She just came to drop off food, left, and only came back to re-fill our water glasses.

My biggest turn off was the price of the food (at least $22 for curry)! There was nothing special about any dish and I felt the flavours were too tame especially for Thai. This is the reason why I only gave this place a 2. It is definitely more geared towards a Western palate.

The menu consists of what you will typically find at a Thai restaurant: appetizers (meat skewers, spring and salad rolls starting at $10.50); spicy soups ($6/$7); salads ($12); meat/seafood/vegetable curries ($21-$25); stir fries ($16-$19); noodles ($14) and rice ($2.75/bowl). If you're with a group of 4 or more, you can also try their 'King's Feast' ($32/person) where the chef selects a variety of food for you to try (3 pieces of appetizer, one main dish per person and rice) if you don't know what to order.

Whenever I go to a Thai restaurant I always have to try their Tom Yum and Tom Kha soups ($7) to gauge how well the rest of the food is. The soups had a mild spicy flavour and didn't have a lot of meat/vegetables in it. Definitely wasn't what I was expecting.

The curries with coconut rice was the highlight of the meal, but even then I wasn't impressed. Each curry dish is enough for two people to share, but at $21 it wasn't worth the price. The spice level was surprisingly mild and the flavours seemed subdued. However, if you decide to come here I recommend getting the \"Red Curry Chicken\" (chicken breast sautéed in a spicy red curry with vegetables; \"Gaeng Keo Wan Pet (Spicy green curry of boneless duck with fresh Thai eggplant) for something unique; and \"Lamb Curry\" (Lamb with taro roots and onions in a medium spicy curry flavored with coconut milk). These curries had the most flavour. 

I was most disappointed in their \"Pad Thai\" ($14). DO NOT GET IT! It was REALLY bland, un-inspiring, and was more like a stir fried Chinese rice noodle dish.

Overall, skip The King and I. You can get much better (and authentic) Thai food for cheaper elsewhere in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I had read many reviews regarding the King and I and have been wanting to come here for months. Never saw it passing by while out and about, had to seek it out. Yes, I am still in search of the most perfect pad thai that Calgary has to offer. Walked in for lunch, was greeted warmly and it was noted that we did not have long for lunch. This was respected throughout the meal, communication great between greeter and waitress. The space itself was beautiful, not too busy. Roomy, cozy, nice soft lighting. The service was good, waitress forgetful at our table and surrounding tables about little things (requested napkins, lemon for our water), no biggie. The waitress mentioned that we must be from another province as we asked for lemon for our water? Her being from L.A, stated that she loves Calgary water, it is not salty as she is used to. So what, I like lemon in my water! LOL! I said nothing of course, just nodded politely. Anyhoo, I went with the pad thai and it came quickly, presentation-wise, very nice, texture of the noodles and veggies, very good. The egg strips on top were prepped in advance and were not warm like the rest of the dish. The saltiness was there as was the sourness of the dish. Where was the sweet? I had asked for extra spicy which consists of you getting chili sauce on the side of the plate and peanuts come as well as lime. I like those touches but still was surprised by the lack of ANY sweet element on the plate. The server advised there are 2 ways the kitchen can prep pad thai but this sour-y one is preferred by customers. OK, fair enough. I would ask for no tofu next time. 3 shrimp came on the dish, few chicken pieces - value so-so. My husband got a green curry chicken - he enjoyed that a lot. He got coconut rice instead of the usual steamed rice bowl and this was a hit. We paid for Jasmine tea with our meal, all in before tip, $38 for 2 people. I would not say that it was a cheap lunch but this place would lure me back to try out another spicier dish. The greeter was nowhere in sight on our way out but the candies were - interesting lemon concoctions, grab a couple of those on your way out if you come to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food at the King & I. I had heard a lot of good things, and frankly, expected much much more in terms of authenticity & flavor. The food was bland - not the poignant, crisp, distinctively Thai tastes I was craving. Our 10$ martinis were watered down, and lacked pizazz. The menu was much too large, and incorporated many Chinese & Vietnamese dishes, to my dismay. Portions were decently sized, but plates were definitely too high. We ordered a Green Curry Lobster, specifically asked for it to be extra spicy when the waiter explained that it wasn't that spicy, and were royally unimpressed by the 32$ dish. It was a muddied green curry, with no zing to it whatsoever. The amount of lobster in the dish was so minimal - maybe half a lobster tail.

The decor was nice, but felt somewhat contrived. It seemed they were trying for intimate with the space division, but it felt much too commercialized for me. The best thing about this place, and the reason I've awarded it 2 stars, was the service. We were served in an attentive and sensitive manor.

I will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome. Fantastic music and dacor. Food was great, don't be surprised at a bit higher price tag but worth going at least once."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into the restaurant, you know you're in for a treat. The decor alone puts you in a Southeast Asian frame of mind, with soft lighting, authentic decorations and a relatively quiet (not like a library) setting that is perfect for a date, or even a meal with family and friends.

There is a lot of care put into the food, and I know this because I interviewed the owner and the chefs. They have all travelled to Thailand extensively and it can be seen in the food. Even basic things like the coconut rice are impressive, so you can just imagine how good some of the more complicated dishes are.

They also pride themselves on service and they certainly live up to their own expectations. Once you're there it is a pretty safe bet that you will be treated well, the food will be fantastic (as are some foe their speciality drinks) and you are going to walk out happy."}
{"text":"I'm glad take away was the only thing on my mind when I ascended upon this second floor eatery. A bit disheveled from a planes (no trains) and automobiles, I was also famished and craving a take away fave, noodles. I placed my order by phone and was happy it was ready when I arrived a mere 10 minutes later. I was surprised to find such an upscale looking space with a clientele that appeared to be all business men on a Monday night. Swank! Perhaps a quiet place for a romantic date?

The friendly staff got me and my Bankok Noodles on our way quickly. But, back in my hotel room I found myself less than satisfied with my choice. A mess of over sauced, under flavoured flour noodles may just not be my thing. There's much more on the menu, and judging by the many 5 star reviews, I would be doing my tummy a disservice by not giving them another try. Stay tuned for an update!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once every two weeks.I love this place!!  By far my favorite place to go for dinner.  
The decor is lovely, the service is exceptional and the food has always been exquisite!"}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Excellent food expertly prepared. Attentive service. Pleasant and relaxing decor and music. It would be to your benefit if you had knowledge of Thai cuisine (more like Thai-fusion) prior to visiting or accompanied by a knowledgeable friend. Very plain rice rice servings are small and pricey. Portions are on the small side, so if bringing along the big guy, you might think twice about this place. ExpenS$ive. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"The food? It's okay. Portions are SMALL AND EXPENSIVE and the food was smothered with oil.
The venue? Nice - this is what earned them 1 star.
The service stinked: too bad for the owner/s but the hostess was way over her head when I came by for some take-out.
Not sure I'd give them another chance to 'wow' me - I don't really think they can. And I usually give second and even third chances but for those prices ... me thinks better NOT!

I am a Yelper: treat me well and I'll give you a good review! Treat me bad and hey, I'm not afraid to share.

:)"}
{"text":"Could this be my final Calgary review???? Not if I can help it! Though I am relocating to Vancouver Island I think I have a  couple more reviews in me before I go.
One of my going away lunches was today at The King and I with a co-worker and the food was amazing! They have a lunch special with a little bit of a few different things and that's what we both went for. There was satay chicken, a spring roll, coconut rice, some noodles with shrimp and pork and ginger beef with lots of veggies. That is A LOT of food for the price (around $14 I think) and it was fantastic. The spicy peanut sauce for the satay was delicious, the stuffing in the spring roll perfect and the veggies in the ginger beef cooked the perfect amount.
So with all this food praise why the 3 star rating you ask? One word.... Service!  We arrived just before noon and were seated quickly. And we waited, and waited and waited until the server stopped by to see if she forgot our tea. When we said that we hadn't ordered any we didn't see her again for another 10 minutes.  From the time we sat down it took 25 minutes to order and then another 20 to get our meal. As mentioned the food was fantastic, probably 4.5 or even 5 star. Slow and in-attentive service brought it down to an average rated restaurant. Too bad......"}
{"text":"I was at The King & I the other day for a Christmas lunch provided by my new employers.  They had arranged for us to enjoy a spread of several different items on the menu.  While not my first experience with Thai food, it was my first experience with The King & I.

The food was phenomenal.  We were able to try different chicken, beef, and shrimp dishes along with some vegetable items.  In particular, I would recommend the Tiger Prawn Curry and Galanga Cashew Chicken, both excellent.  The deserts were also well prepared and I enjoyed a chocolate dish that literally melted in my mouth.  One of our companions did not eat beef, and so our server went to great lengths to ensure he knew what he could and could not eat.

Furthermore, the service was excellent.  Our server thoroughly explained everything that was being served and went to great lengths to ensure we were happy with everything.  Additionally, the atmosphere was amazing and everyone enjoyed the afternoon immensely."}
{"text":"Three dishes delivered came to $61.00 (Cashew chicken, Pad Thai and Som Tum), food was marginal at best and definitely not worth it, even at half the over-inflated prices. AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I both live in Calgary.  We don't see each other often...he's busy with a girlfriend...I am busy with kids.  We finally decided it was time for a get together and for us to meet said girlfriend.  So they booked us into a Thai Restaurant.  As we got closer to the date, we received the details...The King & I Thai restaurant on 11th.  

Well.....I visited this restaurant a couple years ago for a birthday celebration and it honestly didn't wow me (never went back).  But since I was meeting up with my cousin we decided we would try it again.

Firstly the restaurant isn't overly traditional in decor besides the temple statue.  It's just simple...which works.  The food 2 years ago was over priced and so I was disappointed to see yet again each dish way over priced.  I had hopes that at least the food would wow me.

My cousin and his gf ordered the Tom Yam soup and we all shared some crispy spring rolls. They enjoyed their soup and the spring rolls delivered.

We decided on 4 mains to share along with rice.  Bangkok beef, cashew chicken, a curry and pad thai.  

The food was decent but not worth $22+ per dish AND not as good as the Chili Club Thai House.  In the end the food failed to wow me for the second time.  With all the fabulous restaurants in Calgary and new ones opening all the time, I will not be returning to The King & I."}
{"text":"Good place for a first date!
Very classy, yet not too much. 
The staff are courteous and professional the food was really good quality and we couldn't find anything wrong. 
Towards the end the manager, an elderly gentleman came to see how we were doing. Very nice gesture."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I was so impressed! The place is really modern, clean and beautiful. The hostess was super friendly, she checked my coat. I felt like a boss.

We get seated, the menu sounds really good. I get the mee krob, my friend gets the lemon grass veggies. It takes maybe 5 minutes for the food to come: my heart sinks. I don't have high hopes for something that was probably thrown on to the plate. The mee krob was basically egg noodles drowned in the sweet and sour sauce with vegetables that were cooked to varying degrees of doneness (not in a good contrasty way either). The lemon grass veggies were marginally better.

Maybe the other dishes are good and would change my mind about this place, but as of right now: meh."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to The King & I by my mom a few years ago. We had the Moo Moo King Man and since then I have never ordered anything else! It is SO delicious. I also really like salad rolls but couldn't enjoy these ones because of the cilantro =( The atmosphere is really nice, service is good, however it was a tad on the expensive side. I'm sure I'll be back but there are many other restaurants in Calgary to try first!"}
{"text":"How does anyone afford to dine here? This is my initial thought as I am browsing the menu. $80 for the two of us, said and dome. The King & I has an atmosphere more contemporary than most, with a very comfortable seating arrangement, great for large parties. The only downfall is the mediocre food. 
The server is extremely friendly but at the same time extremely pushy. Upselling as much as she can, and not really allowing us to say no. Water? What about cocktails? Oh you don't drink alcohol, what about $4 juice? She wouldn't stop asking so we ordered juice to avoid the awkwardness. We didn't really want an appetizer either
and as soon as that was communicated she wasn't too pleased and it showed. She continued to ignore us and make recommendations anyway. We figured the heavy up selling might be a sign that it was something delicious. $18. It wasn't delicious nor worth $18. 
I ordered a Pad Thai, $25, and they neglected to season the chicken, or anything else, matter of fact. The entire dish had to be douched with chili oil to be edible.   
We ordered another dessert out of pressure, at $8 to find that it was the size of a sauce bowl. 
I could continue to go on, but I think I made my point. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the King and I. Lots of great dishes, but the portions are quite large. I think this is a great place to come if you are sharing dishes. They have a great selection of beers I've never tried which was definitely fun to try and the coconut ice cream was TO DIE FOR. I never wanted to stop eating the ice cream.  The service was great, the food was cooked well and the prices were fair. Overall, I have no complaints! Try it if you are in the neighbourhood :)"}
{"text":"Easily the worst Thai food I have ever eaten. I've eaten Thai food all over the world, from Japan and Malaysia to actually eating it in Thailand. More recently in Vancouver and most recently here in Calgary. This was by far the most hyped, most expensive and most disappointing dining experience of all of them. 
The portions are TINY, the food is mediocre at best, and I got the WORST acid reflux I have ever experienced from eating here. I have NEVER had indigestion/acid reflux from Thai food before. It was aweful, and lasted nearly 3 days!!!! 
The Curry that I ate was SMOTHERED in oil and sat like a ROCK in my gut. Considering my entrée was nearly $20 I was surprised that it came with no rice, I ordered my rice separately and had to ask for a second serving to finish my curry. (which I had to pay extra for btw)
My wife was equally disappointed with her Tom Yum Goong soup - virtually flavourless, no colour in it, no fresh thai basil, only a few shrimps and comically oversized pieces of mushroom.
My dining companions had the \"kings' feast\" and while the food fairly plentiful - all of it looked like soupy, watery overcooked/steamed Chinese restaurant vegetable dishes.
If I had paid a more reasonable price, I *might* go back to give it another shot - but with the prices these guys charge, I'll take my business elsewhere.
I would classify this as a restaurant for older Canadians that have no idea what good Thai food should taste like."}
{"text":"In Short: Westernized Thai, overpriced, small portions.

The decor inside is nice and cozy feeling....  

Service was not great ... we were kinda forgotten at the end (and it wasn't that busy). It took us standing up and putting on our jackets for them to even realize that we wanted to pay.  We were ready to just walk up to the front & wait there to pay!

Now the food... NEWS FLASH!... this is not authentic Thai!   hahah. sorry to burst your bubble.  This is a VERY toned down version of Thai for those who's flavor palate is not adventurous and cannot handle exotic spices.  Thai flavors should be like fireworks and exciting in your mouth - sour, spicy, sweet... This was a bore!   

The Pad Thai was not even pad thai. haha  Looks like they fooled some ppl into thinking that any type of  noodle with crushed peanuts is pad thai. haha.  Coconut rice was not coconutty... The pork curry had cantaloupe in it... and cucumbers...and not spicy, not curry tasting... all i tasted was the coconut milk.  

Guess I'm still on the hunt for good Pad Thai!

Go to a real Thai Restaurant.  They exist!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here once and have not returned. Decor is lovely and service was OK. Food itself was not that tasty and had small portions.  I think people go here to say they've tried it but the flavours seemed to cater to a more western palate and was not as authentic as I had hoped. Thanks for trying but there's many other Thai places to visit in this city."}
{"text":"Meh is the right word to describe this restaurant.  

Overall the King & I have very nice people and great decor. 

Horrid Pad Thai (greasy noodles with a few token veggies and a couple pieces of burnt tofu - looks and taste like they forgot the sauce!).  NEVER GET THIS!

The Green Curry had nice flavour and spice - but NOT worth the $26 dollar price tag. Especially with the overcooked, low quality shrimp.

Coconut rice was okay, but the portion is tiny for your $4.

Also had the veggie spring rolls - had a funny taste I was not a fan of and not enough filling for the size of sheet used to roll them.  These were $11 for 4 small rolls!

You can get absolutely amazing thai food for cheap at The White Elephant and the only reason we didn't go there is because they are closed Sunday's and we were craving Thai.

That is the gist of how we ended up with the King & I's sad and very expensive food in our house...

Don't Bother."}
{"text":"The décor of this restaurant is lovely.  They offer to take your coat when you arrive which would be a great service when it's cold outside.  We had booked for a party of about 10 or so and were seated in a semi private area.  We had 2 servers during our meal and they provided good service to bring the food out and refills our drinks.

The first dish took a little while to come out after we ordered drinks but after dishes came out promptly.  The food seemed decent but I'm not a big fan on Thai food as I find the sauce can be too rich for me.  We pre-ordered for more people but all the plates were almost cleared so either the portions are small or we didn't order enough food.  For the price we paid, I think there should have been more food.  We were there for a few hours and it was an ok evening."}
{"text":"I'm really not planning on writing anything too extensive about the place.  All I can say is that the food was ok at best, in small portions, somewhat overpriced, and \"watered down\" for the tourists.  In other words, ok at best food wise. 

Service admittedly was quite attentive though, and the decor is nice.  That does go a long way.  But honestly, the food can be way hotter and use the right spices."}
{"text":"The King and I was the opposite of what make Thai cooking one of my favorite cuisines in the world.  Thai food should be sweet, spicy, and flavorful.  I would not have used any of the adjectives to describe the meal I ate.  The words I would use would be bland and boring.  I guess I am off to find better Thai food in Calgary."}
{"text":"Long standing as Calgary's most well known Thai place. Always busy. There are some better Thai places in cow town but the K&I has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to the king and I for almost 10 years, absolutely love the food and the quality is always consistent! Love the decor and atmosphere, although on the odd occasion you end up sitting on an awkward corner too close to the next guest! Be prepared during busy times to walk some distance as parking can get chaotic. Would recommend to anyone looking for Thai food and an in between too fancy and too casual restaurant!"}
{"text":"WOWWZERS!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The food is amazing, everytime we go I am amazed by the food, we tend to eat at the King & I monthly and have never been dissapointed.  The atmosphere is nice, the staff very nice, you will not be dissapointed!"}
