{"text":"Tried a chicken pizza and wings tonight...pleasantly surprised!   It was really good, and their wings were great too!"}
{"text":"Quick friendly staff! Love how nice and friendly they are. But and this is huge!!!! The food is bland. I literally found a pizza I actually hate! Everything else is perfect! What a shame!"}
{"text":"For $5, you actually get a decent pizza. In a manner of taste, it's not as good as Pizza Hut or Sbarro (my all-time favorites), but it does the trick if you have a craving for pizza and want (or need) to go cheap. (It's certainly better than going to Little Queasers!) The service here is decent. The gentleman who took my order was polite. Just be forewarned... The area outside the restaurant has - shall we say - some interesting characters that like to hang out especially after dark."}
{"text":"The supreme pizza was excellent the crust was very soft and the wings where made just right. My mother is 84 years old and she love their food and she is a picky eater I would recommend it to anyone."}
