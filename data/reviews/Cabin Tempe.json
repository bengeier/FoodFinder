{"text":"My new favorite spot on mill! I've been to the cabin for an after work beer, dinner and a night out and haven't been disappointed with any of the visits. The menu is diverse, and I've been working my way through it and haven't found anything I would not strongly recommend, they have an incredible selection of beer and the music is always on point! The staff is always great, I've had a bartender Dillon who's served me the last couple of times and is always a great host and entertaining. Highly recommend this place for whatever you're feeling-it looks, smells and tastes amazing and is always a blast!"}
{"text":"Working at the office buildings along Tempe Town Lake, I usually walk down Mill Ave during lunch to find a bite to eat. Tried all the usual places: Loco Patron, Rula Bula, etc. Today, a few coworkers and I walked in Cabin, and were blown away. They did an amazing job with the remodel. Quickly greeted by my server Marissa. She was very sweet and helpful in showing us the lunch menus. We got the calamari as an appetizer, which I usually don't care for. Usually calamari is a little chewy, but this more tender to my liking. My Mediterranean wrap was awesome and very reasonably priced. The manager, Cody, came over to check on us. Overall great experience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I recommend their Sante Fe burger. The staff are attentive, friendly, and quick. I'll most likely stop in again any time I'm back in the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"While my wife shopped for shoes, I shop yelp for a sit down little restaurant. What I found was this place! What a find! Very happy with everything here. The lunch was an incredible price, with incredible portions. Very very satisfied."}
{"text":"Hey great places waitress was on it. Great service awesome drink specials. Girls looks amazing. Food was good."}
{"text":"This place is really cool and has great food but unfortunately the service was subpar."}
{"text":"The Salsa tasted like it was made with ketchup.  We had to strongly suggest that guacamole would be a good addition 2 Mexican food. The wings were dry.  Their saving grace is that they carry whistle pig and four roses. The atmosphere is fun.  The wait staff is friendly and willingly to convince mgnt that guac is necessary.  Thank you to both our wait staff and the manager for making the guacamole.  It was good. It was the best food on the table."}
{"text":"This was our first, and last time there.
My wife ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and the drink came with glass shards in it.
She complained to management and was told stuff happens."}
{"text":"Awesome set up. Did a great job with the remodel. 2 star is for the service. The place is completely dead and we waited 28 minutes til the first drink was delivered at our table. 

A party of 8 decided against ordering food because of the lack of urgency in service. We decided on a different place to go before our drinks were given to us..."}
{"text":"I went last Thursday for their deal! It was the most ridiculous service totally not worth the wait! I'm not exaggerating it took an hour to get our chips and salsa, an hour and a half to get our food and we never ended up getting our drinks not even water. All the tables on the patio were so pissed off. They ran out of budlight and food so early (around 8PM) when we asked how much we owed they said \"Ummmm... $6?\" so we dropped the money and just left without getting the rest of the food! When we asked our waitress where our food was she said \"Honestly I don't know.\"
On the flip side food was not terrible. I would go back if they figured out how to run as a restaurant."}
{"text":"Today we checked out this new place in Tempe. Food was killer and management even came out to make sure everything tasted alright. Huge shout out Elise and Mark for making a great guest experience.  Vibe is chill during the day, and dance party after the sun goes down. Check it out!"}
{"text":"So!!
Place is super good located at the heart of tempe, aka mill ave. 
Environment is pretty cool, like the name says, cabin like. During winter they had a pretty cool fire place. Hopefully during summer they can handle the heat (last place before this was a pain)

Thursday is definitely your best day to go. 
Happy hour is amazing that day. 
8-10pm: 
$.1 cent taco, $.50 cent beer and $.10 chicken wings. 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, music and drinks. Indoor/outdoor is epic as you can be part of it he action and still chat."}
{"text":"It's been here since October but I just got in here. Best ambiance in Tempe, for a few drinks or food - animal heads on the wall, stump tables, wooden lips to welcome you into the women's restroom... what else could you want? A DJ stand made out of whiskey barrels? An awesome guy named Mark who works there? Oh yeah, they have both of those too. This place is kickass without being pretentious, and they have real people serving you who like to have a good time. Highly recommended for locals or visitors!"}
{"text":"I've seen some negative reviews about this place, as well as some positive ones, but I honestly could not have had a better experience here. Stopped in randomly while out of town on a work trip. Manager came by to chat and ask how everything was, and Letti was a phenomenal server! Beer was good, had a good whiskey selection, and the food was great too. Jalape√±o torpedos, avocado egg rolls, and carne asada tacos are all a must. I don't get what would turn someone off on this place. Great spot. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great taco Tuesday happy hour. Big whiskey selection, only a few non major brand domestic beers."}
{"text":"Drove by and decided to stop in for some food and drinks to watch game 7 of the World Series. I'm so happy we decided to try this place out. Love the interior and vibe of the place. The food was absolutely fantastic. Caesar salad was fantastic, avocado egg rolls were delicious, and who can say anything about a BLT that looks like that. They have about 12 beers on tap. Wish they had more craft beers but that's me being choosy. Will definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Mark and Corey were great hosts and very knowledgeable about the menu. Food was great! Avocado egg rolls and braided pretzel were the best! And the expansive menu has more great options. The casual atmosphere and tucked away location will defiantly have me coming back again. Two thumbs way up for the cabin and it's staff."}
{"text":"We went here March 18 about 8 pm. Menu looked amazing. New place in town. Here's my recap:
1. Greeted immediately and told can sit anywhere.
One other party of 4 outside playing beer pong and one bar patron present so food and service SHOULD  be perfect as there is nothing else to do, right??
2. Nice waitress greeted us within 2 mins and took drink order. 2 beers, 1 Tito mule, 4 waters.
3 waitress returned to report no ginger beer for a Tito's mule. Ordered a cosmo instead.
4. Waitress returned to state no cosmo glasses so would serve it in a standard drink glass. Okayed this. 
5. Drink comes and rather than pour a good drink in a large glass, they fill it with cran juice so it just taste like cran juice. Strike one. Stuck with water when normally would have had a second drink.
6. Order potato skins app. They were marginal in flavor but came out quickly.
7. Order 3 burgers, 2 Med, 1 MR and a taco salad with chicken.
8. Food comes in reasonable time. 2 Med burgers are Burnt on one side, talking charcoal, yet the cook served it? Not sure what had his/her attention but when you screw up that bad you certainly don't serve it. MR burger is Med and was good. It was a bleu burger, recommend a tastier blue cheese to be used. Taco salad had great presentation but salsa was fairly tasteless so would recommend adding a dressing. Strikes 2 and 3.

Overall rating 2 out of 5, nice ambiance, good music. Waitress nice and efficient although never offered to refill waters. Non-smokers beware. Smokers outside so it can drift into the open style restaurant. Food rating is D, huge disappointment based on menu. Drinks C, good draft beer (hard to wreck that) but an F for watered down drink and presentation. 

Too many awesome places in Tempe/Phoenix to go to so don't waste your money here unless you want to try a Fri or Sat night to see if more action, drink a draft beer and play some Beer pong. 

Management, get a FT manager in there who cares about the food and the business, find a good chef to oversee the cook and ensure a quality food product. Won't be back unless I hear rave reviews in the future but hopefully you won't continue to lose business by providing future patrons with the same experience. Good luck."}
{"text":"The Cabin has great scenery leaving you feeling like you are away in the mountains. They continually spray maple scented air refresher which gets a bit overwhelming. Our servers were all new and did not seem to know anything about their specials. We ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and chips and salsa. The food was very tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is mind blowing. We came here for the first time on football Sunday, they greeted us with a warm welcome and put us at a table right in front of the tv and by the fireplace. Their hospitality was impeccable and the environment is very comfy and inviting. Sports bars don't always have the best food but I definitely can't say that about the Cabin. Try their avocado egg rolls. You will not be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great I love coming here! Great tacos  good drinks. Me and the boys hit this place all the time! Come to taco Tuesday now its gonna be lit!!!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I were looking for a new restaurant to try instead of going to one of the few places we usually go to. I've been to this place on taco Tuesday and enjoyed the tacos and trivia. I pulled up the menu online and my dad and I  were interested in all the different menu options. We ordered our beers and noticed it wasn't very cool inside. Then we were given the menu, and only a fraction of the items on the online menu were listed. We asked the waitress if this was just a smaller menu since the online menu is what brought us in, and we were told \"Oh, that's still on there? That's our old menu.\" So..... doors open, only a few fans running, and a fraction of the food options that we were wanting to choose from were available. Bartender and waitress were both very friendly, but we didn't find what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Awesome scenery! We got the nachos and they were delicious! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They refused to give me a To-go box. What restaurant does that? 
The waitress also told us \"unfortunately I can't do that\" to almost every request we had.
\"Unfortunately\" for them I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! Would recommend to anyone in the Tempe area!"}
{"text":"The staff here is so amazing! My waitress Tamatha took such good care of us and the manager Mark was so amazing to us. I would definitely recommend this place! Music is great and got to love some football on that tv!"}
{"text":"We are avid Mill Ave visitors and decided to check this place out. Service was very good. Beer selection is mainly domestic big brands. Ordered the chicken walnut salad sandwich and wifey got the chicken kabobs. Both were very good. The only opportunity I can say is the bread used on my sandwich was OK, would of liked a more rustic style to go with the theme. Overall really good service and food."}
{"text":"Heard this place just opened. Went in to check it out and I was blown away. The remodel looks awesome. The food was great. I got the calamari as an appetizer and the grilled chicken sandwich for my entree. Both were very tasty. Morgan was awesome. The manager Mark, was really cool. Checked on us and made sure everything came out right. Can't wait to see what this place looks like at night. Highly recommend everyone come see this new place on Mill."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waitress kept talking to some dudes she knew instead of checking on us or getting us things we asked for. They have veggie burgers but there's a $4 up-charge for some reason(weird considering beef is way more expensive than pinto beans). Yelp offers a free appetizer with first check in and they tried to give us a low quality version of the appetizer. Didn't refill waters at all. Pancakes were dough. Mixed up checks. Honestly impressed at how they managed to mess up every single thing when the place was probably 20% full. Was hoping the food would be good enough to make up for the bad service but it wasn't. I'll never come back and won't recommend to others. 

Update for the waitress who messaged me about this comment supposedly overhearing my table's order: We ordered the veggie burger entree, it was not a substitute to another order. How pathetic, an employee harassing me(literally using vulgarities) for my honest review of what was one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Service was great, outside bar was very quick and easy to order from! We were there after ASU beat UofA (go devils!!!) and a friend of mine had drank too much and really needed food. The bar tender helped me figure out what the fastest dish would be (French fries, which were great by the way) and got her some water asap. Fun atmosphere! If you don't like the smell of syrup you might have problems because they blast the smell throughout the place!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for cabin but was sorely disappointed. My parents were in the area and wanted to go there so we arrived at around 7 and were the only ones dining at the place. The prices seemed a bit high for bar food at around $17/entree and the food was just meh. The kicker though was when my mom ended up chewing on GLASS that was in her drink and when she talked to the manager he defended the situation by saying that \"mistakes happen\". Come on Cabin, I get that food is food and you mainly function as a bar but that kind of response is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place was great! Loved the atmosphere. There was a fireplace going and sports on multiple screens playing the Olympics and college basketball. There are enough TVs to watch whatever your into. Chris was amazing. He and the bar tender/server on shift, Corey were fabulous. Very attentive and enjoyable  to talk to.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, the servers super slow, food orders are constantly wrong, do not come here unless you mind waiting forever and getting the wrong food."}
{"text":"Food, beer, and service all 5 stars. Nothing but good things to say.  Leigh the bartender was very friendly and gave great recommendations.  Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Front door people where very rude. Decided not to even go in. Great place to get a cheap drink."}
{"text":"This place is the shizz nit. No liez. Cum you know won't regret it. I swear"}
{"text":"What a delicious adorable place, the manager Mark is super cool & Our waitress Tamie was very kind & attentive."}
{"text":"I simply asked the Dj to play country and he said \"we can't\" and I said why and he said \"we're not a country bar\" and I said \"there is elk on the wall....\" and he said \"I own this place and it it NOT a country bar....\" WTF its called THE CABIN. Wish it was still moonshine, don't expect anything different besides blasted barley which they themselves say they are like. (Also weak drinks for $$$) NEVER RETURNING"}
{"text":"Fun new place off Mill. Outdoor patio is a perfect place to hangout,  chat & enjoy the music."}
{"text":"Great bar atmosphere. Bartenders are super friendly and Mark is the greatest GM ever! Ask for the apple pie shot!! Waitresses are beautiful...so is Mark..."}
{"text":"I've ordered from the Cabin delivery many of times and am always pleased with the quality of the food I get. The chicken Cobb salad and torpedos are to die for. This past week I ordered for pick up and before I event entered the restaurant, I was greeted ever so politely and the server already knew the to go order was mine. She rang me up in a gippy and I was out of there and back to the office in no time at all. For the price the food is of larger quantity and the freshness is never disappointing."}
{"text":"Came in for a friends birthday, got a medium rare burger and it was the best burger I've had in a long time. The manager was so sweet and comped my friends wine and meal for her birthday. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a bite during happy hour - 50% off a reasonable list appetizers until 7:00 and $4 drafts.  Well priced and kitschy atmosphere with nice outdoor patio seating and plenty of TV's.  The beers on tap are somewhat limited, especially when you compare to their next door neighbors.  And the service is mediocre...at best.  Mostly college-aged girls with no clue about basic service details."}
{"text":"TORPEDOS!! Those are awesome. It's an open area bar cabin themed with a huge fireplace.
The Lemon Chicken entree; comes with cilantro lime rice (over cooked), Vegetables were very good, the Chicken was VERY SALTY, we think it was made with lemon pepper vs actual lemons. We had the Brownie with vanilla ice cream.... Very good & warm.
Great Whiskey selection, plenty of TV's & very friendly waitress.
Overall; nice, friendly & warm. 
GET THE TORPEDOS!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the one in Glendale/Peoria and it was fantastic. This location however was awful! Waitress didn't even know if they had miller lite. She stated they were out of the pretzel then the table next to us got one. We ordered an appetizer and a 2nd round of drinks that never came. We left and went next door to blasted barley for lunch and it was awesome! Blasted barley was also super busy and we had good service. The cabin was dead had 4 tables."}
{"text":"I live on the outskirts of mill ave so I was quick to come in and check out the cabin. As I was browsing the menu outside the manager struck up conversation and then walked in our group of three. He had some nachos sent over and all around the service was great. It's nice to have a family bar and grill with great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Cabin is awesome and 42oz beers? Sign me up! The Ozark was on point. Ask for AJ, she was great!!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT get the nachos! Worst nachos I've ever had. If you do get the nachos don't spend the extra 4 dollars on the six jelly bean sized carne asada pieces. Very dissatisfied and I'll never eat there again-- waste of 15 dollars."}
{"text":"A different vibe from the other places in Tempe, and especially a different vibe from the norm on Mill, in the best way. If you're looking for a place that has an atmosphere that allows you to escape from the desert, enjoy a cold brew, grab food and awesome conversation, then this is your place! Be sure to ask for Lee, the bartender, if you want the best experience and Mark, the manager, could handle any concerns/issues you had (though we didn't have any, he was very friendly & genuinely cared about our experience)."}
{"text":"10/10 I would highly recommend cabin in all aspects on the line. The food is absolutely phenomenal, with extremely generous portions as well (which for me calls for yummy leftovers). The staff always goes above and beyond to meet the expectations every deserving customer needs. As well, they are very friendly and personable the second you get into conversation it's like you've known them your whole life. I love coming here for lunch and dinner, as well as their night life. It is such a great time like any other bar that sits on mill, great music, a good crowd and still exceptional service even when all of their employees are super busy and have a great number of people to attend to."}
{"text":"We came for a soft opening and tried the buffet. 
Food: buffet food consisted of avocado rolls, pork rinds (definitely need some sort of sauce), jalape√±o poppers (bacon could be crispier) and coconut chicken (too much breading).

Service: super confusing. We came for an open house - but no one came around to talk to us about the restaurant or offer a to go menu or take our order for drinks.

Options were definitely on the heavier side."}
{"text":"Mark and Cory were excellent. Super helpful and very accommodating. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible, the staff are rude and very inattentive. Would not recommend to anyone going to mill ave in Tempe. Would recommend other bars vary close like Rula Bula or Low Key"}
{"text":"I love the people who work here and the prices are great! Taco Tuesday is my absolute favorite. The torpedo tacos are to DiE for."}
{"text":"Cory is one of the best bartenders I've ever encountered. He made us his own craft cocktails and the food is phenomenal. Will always recommend. GET THE STEAK"}
{"text":"The best place on mill for Sunday football hands down. Everything from giant burgers and fries to salmon grilled shrimp. Always great deals on drinks and the staff is cool to hang around with. Not a bad place to drink on the weekends either. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place was horrible!!! Hit this place up on Thursday, it was slammed so they were charging 5 dollar cover. No problem paid my cover walked in and walked around checking it out. I wandered over to a high top and stood there hoping a waitress would stop by.... 10 min later and 4 waitresses walk by twice and a manager walks by looks at me and continues to go. I understand your busy however what do i need to do to get a beer and a food menu. Finally i chased down the manager and asked for a menu. He asked if I was seated by a host at the table, I responded \"I wasnt told i needed to be seated by anyone for a empty high top\". He told,me i would need to go back outside and put my name in and wait 30-45 min for that high top. Seriously.... He then said \"we are out of wings anyway\". I had never said anything about wings or anything... I just asked for a menu and a beer. So after i was kicked off the table I wandered to the slammed bar to try to get me a beer. Again, 3 bartenders and they were all too busy selling dollar zimas or some wine cooler craps to even help me. I finally got a bartenders attention and asked for a coors. He said \"thats not on special bro\"... I responded with i didnt need it to be on special thats what id like. At that moment a girl asked for 5 schmirnoff ices and he completely ignored me and helped her. I am aware this place is catering college kids. However, you would think money is money. Nope apparently college money is worth more then my money. I was pissed. I walked to the front door told the manager what happened and how disappointing the customer service in this place was and asked for my 5 dollars back. I was forced to give a star, so I'll say its for him nicely giving me back my cover charge. What a waste of time,and energy to come in here if your not 21 wearing skinny jeans or jogger pants."}
{"text":"I came to checkout this new business and was pleasantly surprised. I wanted to see it, but I won't lie... I definitely had a pessimistic attitude because of a rough week and I didn't think anywhere on Mill would help that. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Cabin Tempe. 

First thing is the down to earth staff. We had a table upstairs and were lucky enough to have Tamatha as our server.  She was a legit and down to earth-- not that obvious fake personality I've seen more and more in bars. She's definitely an asset to Cabin Tempe. Luckily most of the staff I interacted with were very personable... Including the bouncers. That's pretty impressive for Mill. 

I'm glad they have personable staff, because their prices are pretty high (think old town scottsdale pricing). Redbull and vodka is $9 and a double is $16. I understand red bull is more expensive, but I can literally get the same drink at mint for the same price... and mint included grey goose. 

Inside is definitely a different layout than the prior bar that was here. It was a pretty slow night so it's hard to say if it will be beneficial for dancing or not. We shall see."}
