{"text":"Uncle Betty's is a family foodie heaven: the sole Toronto provider of New York's famous Dreesen's doughnuts, a colourful ice cream and dessert bar, warm and fuzzy comfort food, and a small selection of beer and wine for the grown-ups in the crowd, all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike. Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.

Offering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the \"best ever,\" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. 

For dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.

The service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the \"gourmet\" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. 

Most appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. 

Betty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday around 1pm and had to wait for about 10min for a table of 2. 

We ordered the eggs Benny on a donut and the stuffed french toast. I loved the ricotta stuffed French toast because the ricotta made it lighter than cream cheese. 

The donut in the eggs Benny was a nice change to the usual English muffin. The sweetness of the donut balanced the peameal. 

I would definitely go back for brunch and get some donuts to go."}
{"text":"Went here awhile ago (gave it a second try) and didn't work out like the first time. Wait was too long, staff looked very disorganized and confused- one dude seemed to be the head server/host - really weird set up. Finally we were placed (hustled) and our table was still dirty. Took 10 mins for one cup of coffee.
Got the food, sub-par, left feeling ripped off for the price we paid. Too overpriced. Will continue going to Boom instead!"}
{"text":"Who could resist a nice stodgy meal after a hard week of work and a late Friday night soir√©e. If you're one of the many looking for a traditional American style comfort food restaurant then Ugly Betty's is for you. The meatloaf is to die for, grilled cheese combinations are plentiful and breakfasts cooked to perfection. The staff are pleasant, knowledgable and eager to make your visit an enjoyable one. Even so, my review has fallen short to average unfortunately due to the slightly high prices as well as the abundance of grease and grossly over cooked vegetables. If you're sticking to meat and cheese you'l be golden, else be wary."}
{"text":"Went for sat brunch. Wait tines were ok. Got the ultimate grill cheese (pulled pork & meatloaf). Delicious! Ended with ice cream & cinnamon  donut. Ice cream is from kwartha dairy. Donuts made fresh every morning.  Tastes like tiny toms."}
{"text":"Super cute diner! They have a weekend brunch menu and an all day breakfast menu in addition to their regular menu. They also serve ice cream and donuts. When line ups are long, they offer those waiting in line donut samples. Delicious! I normally get the Cobb salad there which comes in very generous portion sizes. I don't think I've ever finished an entire salad in one sitting. Another great choice is the grilled chicken sandwich with sunflower seed pesto with their skinny fries."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not a difficult meal to prepare. Somehow they got everything wrong! 

I ordered the sweet potato hash meal... The potatoes were severely undercooked, some were still raw. The toast was... well, not toasted. The coffee wasn't fresh, either. My girlfriend got the stuffed blueberry French toast. All they did was blend some blueberries with what seemed line ricotta cheese and smear it on toast. Not really stuffed with anything nor was it French toast. Plus they didn't provide syrup, despite us asking twice. 

When the waitress walked up to ask us how we liked the meal, she just kept on walking and didn't wait for a reply. 

So, crappy food + crappier service = $40

Save your money, go to the Tim Horton's across the street."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to breakfast here and was a bit disappointed.   I had the big breakfast and received an over cooked pancake, toast that wasn't toasted and home fries that were up there with one of the worst I've had.  My husband had the grilled cheese with pulled pork which he thought was pretty incredible and the reason I give this place 3 stars.  For the price there are so many other great places to have brunch in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I have been to Uncle Betty's twice and can definitely vouch for the grilled veggie sandwich and the Chicago hotdog. The grilled veggie sandwich was exceptional (my friend got it and loved it) and I have had the Chicago dog twice now and both times it was reallllllllllly good - hot peppers, celery salt, onions and a slice of pickle. 
Side salad was really fresh and dressing was very good. Chocolate shake is solid. 
Greg's ice cream, obviously amazing. Owners very nice!
I think the other criticisms are a bit harsh - the service could be improved, but the food, or at least what I have tried, is good."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. The staff are always friendly and the service has been awesome in the two years we've been coming here.

We've mostly go on weekends for brunch or dinner and the food is always great. The poutine dishes are a meal on their own, but not something I would want to eat every day. The cobb salad was one of the best I've had in this city.

We always have the donuts with ice cream. Fights have broken out at our table over those things. Eventually we'll get around to trying something else.

If you are planning to come here for diner you may want to consider skipping lunch."}
{"text":"Coney Island dog is the only thing I have ever ordered from here and it's great. I'm not a big hot dog fan but when I crave one I'll come here."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on that TV show You Gotta Eat Here, and guess I went in with high expectations. It was a very average place! I ordered the big people Mac n cheese without the bacon and it had no salt, therefore no taste. The fries were pretty good. I was hoping to have the famous chocolate twinkies, but they were sold out... It was only 8 pm. Why wouldn't they make enough of this?! It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I fully admit, I judged this book by it's cover (oh! nice branding!) and got the sour end of that assumption.
Went in for lunch, excited that they had Greg's ice cream, then realized how dirty and uncared for the entire place was. I picked up the sugar for my coffee and it stuck to the bottom of the table with a lingering pool of miscellaneous substance. Ordered chili and toast & side salad. My boyfriend ordered pulled pork and a side salad. While we waited I started to look around, the glass of the ice cream case hadn't been wiped down in a week by the looks of the one thousand fingerprints smeared across it. Ok cool, I thought, I've eaten in dirty places before, no biggie.
Food came, chili was an oil slick of watery beef, and both our salads were sadly filled with rotten leaves and a spoiled cucumber. Had to send them back. At least the staff were friendly.
So at least they have a cooler of Greg's ice cream right? NOPE. The sides were labelled with Kawartha Dairy, which is fine, but lesser quality, and they market it like it's all the same. 
Skip this joint, many more places to eat in this strip that are far better!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. We had to stand and wait for good 25 minutes for that british guy to seat us...and waited over half an hour for pulled pork sandwitch... wretched service. Service in the Congo is better, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Great food, service was no problem (other reviewers seem to have this issue). Came for brunch and was excellent. No oversized portions either. Had the eggs benedict. Would recommend for any Midtown brunch seeker."}
{"text":"Not worth the trip.

The food was blah and the service wasn't great either. I should have listened to the reviews. No idea why they were featured in you've gotta eat here..."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day because I had been dying to try out their dessert selection. Unforuntuately, it took us a long while to be seated, and when we did get seated we had to wait 15-20 minutes before we could even place our order. 
However, despite the long wait time I must say that the staff were very friendly (especially the tall brown haired man), and the food was great. I ordered the icecream donut sandwich which was amazing. I do plan on coming back for more so hopefully the service won't be as slow."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but unfortunately the branding and the deserts could not make up for mediocre food and poor service. Have been there twice as we thought we had just hit a bad night the first time but our second visit confirmed that they just don't quite have it all together.  Everyone is nice but how many times do you want to hear apologies for slow service (we counted at least 8 not to mention the apologies we overheard being given to the other tables). The food was ok - we had chili, fish and chips, chicken fingers and a Cobb salad - but not even good enough to want to finish. We even decided to skip desert, which is their speciality, because we just wanted to get out."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 3 stars. Besides the friendly staff and quick service, the food is amazing. The Mac and cheese is perfect I wouldn't change a thing about it. Poutine has a vegetarian mushroom gravy option which was really good. The donuts are made fresh daily, and if you go near the end of the day, the owner may give you some for free! Definitely would return here. Overall great food and experience."}
{"text":"We went to check out this place because it was on a Toronto Life list of favorite places, along with other great places like Lisa Marie, Bar Buca and Lady Marmalade. Let me tell you, Uncle Betty's does not belong on that list. 
The grilled cheese sandwich looks great on the menu but it was a disappointment. The Eggs Benedict are nothing special, and are served with nothing but a sad side of home fries. A little fruit would have been nice but that comes at an extra charge. 
For such a small place we expected at least our order to be right, but some of the items we ordered were never served. The spotty service, which included a grumpy teenager, put the nail on the coffin. 
The place is kids friendly and the menu seems to cater to that demographic. Unless you have a family with kids under 5, I would say skip it."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this diner, but the experience ended up being incredibly disappointing. The service was awful. We were seated off in a corner and after our food was delivered, our server never return to check in on us or fill up our drinks. Having finished our meal, we sat with empty plates in front of us for a good ten minutes before flagging down one of the staff who reacted rudely when I asked for the bill.

The staff were just completely inattentive. I even had to get up to get some maple syrup from the counter at the back because our server failed to even ask us if we wanted some for our French toast. 

The food wasn't anything special. The sweet potato \"hash\" was just roasted sweet potatoes with a few scattered mushrooms and onions thrown in and the poached eggs on top were overdone. The \"stuffed\" French toast had a very small amount dollop of ricotta and a meager amount of berries.

The coffee was lukewarm. 

Maybe I should have gone with the ultimate grilled cheese as it sounds like that's the thing to get in this place. Unfortunately the service was so bad to deter me from giving their food a second chance."}
{"text":"Food is good here. Your typical breakfast. Pancakes are the best thing there. The problem about this place is the staff. Every time I've gone the staff is soo rude."}
{"text":"After entering for the first time in this place, while standing and observing the place and waiting to be seated, an older person - I presume a waiter, came up to us and said:
\"Excuse me!!!\" (with the tone of voice \"I can't believe you just did that!\")
\"The brunch is over. The lunch is coming in more than half an hour. Sooo......\"
I really thought we are on Candid camera. 
Maybe it is forbidden for children, although mine was really quiet when we entered, but other than that, I have no rational explanation for that tone or that sentence.
Resisting the urge to ask \"Are you a restaurant or?...\", we just left. 
Never to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing greasy brunch. I came here after watching this restaurant being featured on the TV show \"You gotta eat here.\" Since then, I have been back multiple times because it is so delish. The eggs Benedict, stuff French toast and the ultimate grilled cheese are my favourites on the menu by far. The eggs Benedict is served on one of their freshly made donuts, so it is the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. The stuffed French toast was so rich and creamy without being overbearing. And the ultimate grilled cheese is a sandwich is stuffed with Mac & cheese and your choice of pulled pork or meatloaf - I've had it both ways and each is amazing. My only criticism here is that there is no hostess to take your name or seat you when you arrive so it can be a little awkward waiting around until one of the servers has time to help you (usually no more than 5 mins). Regardless, the food is epic and I will continue to go back and recommend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"I went in this place for brunch with my friend today. Service was slow, we had to wait forever to get our bills and they forgot about our utensils. Main problem is that their food really isn't great at all.. I got egg benedict and the eggs were fully cooked, not runny. My friend's grill cheese was horrible. The macoroni inside was very blend, no flavor. We make better grill cheese at home..  I would give it 1.5 star.. Will never come back!!"}
{"text":"The positive: The coffee is superior quality, which is great for a diner! They serve Greg's Ice Cream which is some of Toronto's best homemade ice cream. The donuts are delicious and supposedly low calories. The wine is affordable for the neighbourhood!

The negative: They still haven't worked out their staffing issues. The servers they have are friendly and genuinely trying, but are completely run off their feet trying to do too much. They need more staff especially on weekends as service sometimes takes a really long time.

They are constantly running out of donuts and that seems to be the product they're most promoting! It's like Tim Horton's running out of coffee.

Finally, the main course food is hit or miss. Sometimes the food comes cold and greasy as if it's been sitting under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Brings you back to your childhood with a twist. Very kid friendly. Those doughnuts are a killer. ;)"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday at the tail end of lunch and found a table for two without waiting. I had the ultimate grilled cheese with homemade mac and cheese with all beef meatloaf. The toppings were thick and overflowing with flavour. Ultimate cure to hangover. Must try for any fan of Mac and cheese! The meatloaf was an interesting spin ... But definitely worth the grease stain it left on my hand!"}
{"text":"Update.  I've eaten at Uncle Betty's about 10 times.  

On the plus side, you get hot fresh donuts if you eat there in the morning.  On the downside, your clothes will reek like fryer oil because the display fryer in the dining room is far from properly ventilated.  I think they should move the fryer downstairs and put in more seating.  Took two dry cleanings to get the smell out of my wool coat.

It really bothers me that the owner has told me each time I eat there that there is \"only\" X number of calories in the donuts.  C'mon!  They are not health food, so don't promote them like they are.  It seems dishonest.  What's worse is that he doesn't recognize me from eating there so many times that he keeps repeating this each  visit.

Service is always slow.  I love the male server with dark hair/eyes/glasses who has been there at least a year, but he's overstretched.  He's AMAZING with kids.  I saw him get a kid to eat his veggies (enough to make any woman think he's a superstar). I wish the owner played a more hands on role and would jump in to help bus and run food to tables.

They do not have a waiting area, so you have to hover over the people on the patio or tables just inside the door in the awkwardly curtained entrance.  Even when tables open up, they are consistently understaffed to bus the tables or get people seated.

Their salads are really fresh -- which is surprising coming from a diner.  I usually get their house salad.

Coffee is above average but it will get you buzzing!  They are good at refilling it.  Hooray.

Their hot dogs are huge.  Usually only see big links from street carts. \"The Uncle Betty\" is a serious meal and very addictive.

2 Meatball sliders  and a house salad is enough for most people as an entree.

The Greg's roasted marshmallow ice cream is still my fave and so glad they are closer than going to Greg's store downtown.  They often give people blow torched marshmallows as a dessert, but do not eat them because they'll ruin this ice cream if you eat them first.  I do wish they kept their ice cream freezer colder though.

There is parking for 3-4 cars parallel to the building if you're lucky.  Otherwise metered parking on Yonge St and 1 hour parking on side streets."}
{"text":"We dined at Uncle Betty's last month using a Groupon to check out a new-ish local spot.  Always looking for a new little diner to frequent and enticed by the mouthwatering menu items I had perused online, I was excited to go on a lunch date as my man took a break from work. 

Let us start with the positives, shall we? The panko crusted onion rings although light in the portion size (even after $2 additional as a substitute) were delicious. Perfectly crispy and beautifully stacked.  The pulled-pork, mac'n'cheese grilled cheese sandwich (yes, all that, one sandwich) was a mix of ups and downs. The ups: see ingredient list above, as amazing as it sounds. The downs: the simple white bread was soggy and just not substantial enough for the sammy.  At least a texas cut toast would have been nice. We also ate the steak sandwich a the recommendation of the server. meh.

Ok, the positives above may seem not so positive, but in contrast to my following comments on the service... everything is relative my friend. We arrived around 12:30 during the week to a fairly empty restaurant with what seemed flexible hour to get in and out. There were two servers on, one seemingly the main guy and another female server who mostly took direction and scooped ice cream.  The first bit of our interaction, approach and drinks, went smoothly, but then it got busy.  It took the server 15 minutes to return after he made recommendations for previously decided order, causing us to need just a little more time. The food was taking what seemed like forever as the service team mis-communicated and worked rather inefficiently.  Eventually reinforcements arrived in the guise of what looked to be the owner.  He  got to work quickly really rolling up his sleeves and making magic happen.  Arriving with our lunch he was friendly and we ate with no quality check from anyone. Time for the bill and again we wait.  Even after a flag down and request the bill, we wait.  

The bottom line: what was supposed to be a quick lunch turned into an almost 2 hour ordeal. The food was not tasty enough nor well portioned enough to justify the $65 lunch bill for two with two beers.  Had it not been for our Groupon I would have felt rather cheated for my money.  

A word to the owner: more staff, more quality staff, and don't be late for the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"I would give half a star if I could. Brown soggy lettuce in the Caesar salad with about three lettuce stumps. Poutine flavourless. Friends seemed to enjoy the pulled pork but I truthfully would never return. It's a wonder this place has survived.."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and another couple and we each had a 12month old child. They were accommodating for moving us to a table of six on a busy day at a busy time. Food came out quick enough for a busy diner and the staff was attentive to coffee and always in reach. 

Would definitely go back for dinner to try it out."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last Saturday - had to wait a long time for a table because my friend was late (they will not seat you if your party is not all there) but as soon as she arrived, we were seated right away. 

I ordered the macaroni and cheese special with pulled pork. It was basically mac and cheese between two pieces of bread with a bunch of pulled pork. It was pretty good but really heavy since it's served with a side of fries/home fries (carbs overload!) 

My boyfriend ordered the egg's benedict which I thought was delicious but if you really don't like sweet and savory together, you won't like it since it's served on one of their homemade donuts. 

We ordered a donut to try but didn't think it was anything special. The real disappointment was when I ordered the homemade twinkie. When I saw it I had to order it because I was just talking about how much I wanted a twinkie but wanted one homemade so I figured it was fate. The twinkie was TERRIBLE. There is the smallest amount of cream filling inside and it's basically just a chocolate cake (a bad one at that) molded into a twinkie. It was so dry and terrible and not worth the price at all. 

I was also super disappointed with their orange juice that tasted like plastic. It was really awful and I couldn't even drink it. 

Service was okay - our drinks and food arrived fairly promptly but our waitress was no where to be seen after that. I was also mad since she specifically said the twinkies were amazing. Damn her for getting my hopes up! 

The food is decent but it's definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great Family restaurant. It covers all the basis. From fun to healthy meals. Food is good. Atmosphere is simple and nice. Great milk shakes and an awesome grll chese   
This place was recomende by son again. Apparently he has the ability to pick good family restaurants."}
{"text":"I like many have see this restaurant featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and for that reason I figured I would give it a try.  My wife and I have been to several restaurants featured on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" and although not every restaurant that we see on these shows are everything they tell us it is - I do have to say that this is the first restaurant that I had tried that was truly disappointing and did not live up to the hype of TV.

We had read several reviews about the restaurant and almost decided not to try it out as a result - but chose to just to say that we did.  It was pretty much everything that the other reviews said it was.

The Service - yes it is a little diner and although I don't expect the service I would receive from somewhere like North 44 - I did expect the server to be a little bit friendly. but instead it was pretty much quick and to the point.  Drop the food off and walk away.  Let's me clear here - most of the tables were empty so it was not like they were rushing off to another customer.

The $$$ - It was expensive (very expensive) that said - for good food and service and experiencing food that I would not normally get somewhere else - I am fine with that.

The food - My wife ordered the burger and fries and I have to say this burger was good.  It was not overcooked - which I find most burgers are when you go out to eat in Toronto and the fries were pretty good as well. I ordered the grilled cheese (with mac 'n cheese and meat loaf).  The idea is awesome and the bread was good but the mac 'n cheese was very bland and the meat loaf was definitely nothing to write home about.  I also decided to order the poutine instead of the fries (for a hefty $$) and I have to say this was the worst poutine I had ever had.  It came in a small bowl with a some fries smothered in a gravy and cheese.  I have eaten alot of things in my time - but I have to say that I could not finish it - and I finish just about everything.  It resembled more of a gravy and cheese soup more then poutine.

The good - The chocolate shake (although over priced) was very good as were the donuts we grabbed for the kids for later that day.  That said, these are not reasons for us to ever return.

So, am I disappointed we went there today? Nope - because I can say that I went - would I recommend it to anyone? Nope - unless you want to try it for the sake of trying it - like us."}
{"text":"I am adding this to my List of Top Ten Places to Eat in Toronto for People Who Decide To Eat In Toronto Even Though Food Is Crazy Expensive.

Every visit, I did the same thing. Ordered \"real food\" with the intention of \"I'm going to try the doughnut this time\" and never got around to it. (I'm sure it's fantastic.)

Everything here is tasty. Too many times hungover at this place. Happy memories...

Can't wait to see you again. 

Greetings from the other CA!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Uncle Betty's. Our server was friendly and attentive, and he also provided great suggestions. He was even patient and friendly to a very indecisive woman sitting in earshot.

The place is decorated very cutely and it's bright and clean. Be prepared for a bit of a walk if you're traveling by TTC as it's smack dab in between two subway stops (1.5 km north or south from Eglington or Lawrence). 

The food I had was delicious and unique. I had the grilled cheese sandwich and it's by far the best I have ever had. There was cheese, macaroni and cheese, and meatloaf between two perfectly grilled slices of bread - some crazy genius concocted this beauty I tell ya.  And the side salad was fresh and crisp. My boyfriend had the Chicago hotdog and that was pretty good too (although he wished he had ordered my grilled cheese too). 

I had the doughnut sundae for dessert and I don't regret it. The doughnut was fresh and still a little crispy and who doesn't love Greg's ice cream? 

The serving sizes were great for me but I normally find servings too big. If you are feeling like a hungry hungry hippo when you visit perhaps you will need an appetizer."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty lousy, all around, a most typical midtown Toronto dining experience. The restaurant being mostly empty at 10:30 on Saturday should have been a huge giveaway. The restaurants in this part of town really suck. 

Where this place fails is on details:

- servers are unprofessional (saw a server whack a regular customer on the knee with a menu before presenting it to another table)
- servers do not write anything down (server took our order, walked over to a table of regulars instead of going directly into the kitchen... and promptly forgot our order, instead sending over a manager-type who lied about there being a printer issue... I'm not an idiot... there's no printer issue, server got distracted by a table of regulars and didn't put it in and he forgot it, because, ta-da, he didn't write it down)
- walls were dirty and sticky
- staff did not seem to have assigned tasks... they were running around all over the place, but not really doing much besides socializing with regular tables
- we were told to sit wherever we wanted, but none of the tables were prepped with napkins or silverware 
- cream was not refilled (coffees took 15 minutes to arrive)

Food is OK. Eggs were fried nicely, donuts were dry, hashbrowns were really good. 

- have to mention the sausages... which were among the worst I've ever had. English banger style, but overcooked to mush. One snip of the casing with a knife revealed what was basically pork puree. 

The manager-type guy did his best to fix up issues, nice guy, despite the lie (since tables who arrived after us got their food before we did... what printer problem?), but I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I will never go to Betty's Uncle for food again!
Have been there a few times before, being that it is so local and all this time it was Meh not bad!
Brought friend there for her first time to uncle bettys...not a good experience for her either. The service was extremely slow... beyond slow ...slow. Not just that but the waitress had a glib attitude upon seating and also totally \"out of it\"! 
Food was bad! Ordered the breakfast poutine thing. Home fries were hard...,undercooked potatoes ! 
Asked to pay bill twice! 
Overall not good at all!
Wont go back!"}
{"text":"Uncle Betty, I want to like you, I really do. But this morning you ruined my birthday brunch before it even began.

All I wanted was Eggs Benedict on a donut.

Instead, I get ignored by the staff while waiting for a table. Then I get yelled at from the center of the room when a table opens up; I get seated with a dismissive wave and a point of the finger. I get menus thrown at us. I get asked 3 times by 3 different people if I want coffee, and yet it never comes. I get up and leave after 15 minutes. I get a look of shock that we're walking out from the rude kid in glasses who was trying to act as host.

Uncle Betty, I tried to imagine your chaos as an endearing quirk but you've worn me down. Like Dave G who also walked out today, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dessert and got the donut ice cream sandwich. It was lovely and the servers were so nice! They chatted with us, gave suggestions and offered to make our hot chocolates EXTRA chocolatey the way we like it!

When we'd paid the bill and were lingering the owner gave us some christmasy shots on the house and wished us a happy holiday. Such a nice touch. Great neighbourhood spot!"}
{"text":"Busy on sat for brunch. But the wait was short and food came out quickly. We got the ultimate grilled cheese. Both the pulled pork and meatloaf options are good. The portion is huge so if you're not hungry I advise sharing one. We also had ice cream for dessert. The mint chocolate ice cream reminded me of the kind I used to get when I was little. All in all great food, friendly staff and decent prices. I'd go back. The lunch menu looks great too!"}
{"text":"Note: this is only a review of service as we didnt have the opportunity to dine here!

We were at this diner on Family Day and after waiting for about 25 minutes with a bunch of other people (about 10 people in parties of 2-4) ahead of us, we were extremely disappointed that no one even came to acknowledge or take down names for seating etc. This was when, on counting for lack of anything to do while standing in line, there were about 6-7 tables available to be seated. After realizing that nothing was going to change, we left and so did most of the other prospective parties. 

Maybe it was a lack of organization on part of the mgt to not staff well on Family Day but it was a let down!"}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment! The Yelp photos looking sooooo gooood tempted the tastebuds but the visit neutralized them. Fries were skinny and dried up, not a good companion to the \"thimble-full\" portion of gravy. BLT was OK but sloppily served on a plate, (had to reconstruct the sandwich myself as the toothpick didn't keep anything together). Service was lousy for 1 o'clock on a Fri afternoon. Patio patrons seemed content to be eating on the street beside rushing pedestrians and traffic but the atmosphere inside seemed gloomy. The floor was dirty (fork and fries under our table), lots of servers meandering about but unhappy. Honestly the diner had a very cold and unwelcoming vibe. 2 BLT's, 1poached eggs, 3 fries/gravy, 2 coffees served in demi-tass cups soaked us for 50 bucks! C'mon guys....for that price I'd like the other half cup of my coffee and a smile at least!"}
{"text":"Unique menu, friendly staff and good food. Definitely not the kind of food that I could eat on a regular basis but good for when you want to fill up on some comfort food"}
{"text":"The macaroni/meatloaf grilled cheese is probably the only reason to come to this place. It was delicious. Everything else is fairly basic."}
{"text":"We gave this place a go after hearing good reviews and cannot complain! I got a standard breakfast with scrambled eggs and it was really good a decent price and good portions (thought it would be a bit skimpy on the portion sizes). Well recommended, but would advise to get there before 11am on a weekend as it gets very busy!"}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars **

Came here last Sunday for brunch with a friend - my first brunch in my own neighbourhood, and not downtown! Aforementioned friend had been here twice and loves it, and wanted to share her love of Uncle Betty's.

The decor is cute. And it's definitely not hurting for business - it was bustling when we arrived, so we had to wait in line for seating ... which I think was *about* half an hour? I spent the first 10 minutes in the corner, making sure people didn't swing the door in my face when they came and went.

The food was decent - I tackled the Big Breakfast while my friend got an omelette. And man, was it a lot of breakfast. (Minor quibble: I ordered toasted rye; I got whole wheat. But I chalk it up to perhaps the noise?) But it was decent.

Service was decent - the wait staff kept my friend and I in stiches. 

Overall, it was okay. I'd come back another time, but I'd like to try other places in the area before I return."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. As it stands when my girlfriend and I rolled in after getting our nails done around 3:00 last weekend, we were super kindly told by the owner that they were between meals and could only do ice-cream. We decided to eat elsewhere and then come back for some desert.

Design wise, it's adorable. Anyone who knows me knows I love a good 'stache. Looking at the menu, my friend pointed out that it read like how I'd want my restaurant's menu to read, a bit kitschy, a bit ridiculous, all tempting. So definitely watch for the update for this review, I'm hoping I can get there after they've gotten over some kinks, and love the food.

Joc and I decided to try a donut ice cream sandwich (!!) with Greg's Roasted Marshmallow ice cream in the middle. I LOVE THIS ICE CREAM. I live in Vermont for most of the year, but this ice cream makes me all Ben and Who? Butttt - Most of the flavor was lost on the donut sandwich topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, it all tasted like a delicious fatty mess. When I tried a bit of ice cream solo though, I was a happy girl.

All in all, warm if frazzled, def one to keep an eye on."}
{"text":"Ugh. I went with a friend today, I won't return.
We stood at the entrance waiting to be seated (there were empty tables, inside and out) and were passed/ seen by 3 members of staff. Having been ignored we went to seat ourselves at one of the empty tables. A waitress then said \"is there anything I can help you with?\" Really. A table would be good.
We ordered our food, that was a challenge. I ordered the exact same as my friend, I guess \"I'll have the exact same\" was difficult........ we had to go through all the options.... ugh.
I know the restaurant has no control over tired/ cranky/ screaming/ crying children, or inattentive/ distracted parents, but please, if a parent decides to leave with said child, don't keep him waiting at the cash, making conversation and laughing. Expedite his bill and allow him to remove his by now screaming child as quickly as possible.
We were brought the wrong food, we did eventually get the right order, it was so so.
When we got the bill, I paid. Two minutes later a waitress came and said would you like to pay by credit or debit. Neither sweetheart, we just paid.
That was probably the most attention we got the whole time we were there.
As I said, I won't return."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on 'You gotta eat here' I had to try it! 

We came here on the weekend- big mistake! It was queuing out the door! we were seated rather quickly much to my surprise. the service was quite slow but we didn't mind as we could see how rushed off their feet the servers were! 

The noise level however was deafening, and we felt rather rushed for someone else to get our table.

The food- I don't know if i had my expectations to high because of the hype over this place but I must admit i was disappointing. I opted for the famous pulled pork and mac sandwich and it was dripping in fat and grease, eek.
My Fiance had the eggs benny on a donut and enjoyed it!

Overall I think I would like to give this place a second chance, perhaps when it isnt so busy!"}
{"text":"The service has gone downhill since the last time I came here. There's nobody managing inexperienced staff who aren't able to clear off empty tables to seat people in the lineup waiting for over 30 minutes. Those tables are empty for gods sake.. I've been informed the wait would be around 15 minutes for at least three separate times I asked. 

As for the food, it was poorly presented and didn't come to our table till 2:00pm (we came at 12:40 and was seated around 1:30). The pancakes are just lumps of dough with no texture and the home fries were stale. 

The grilled cheese sandwich was drilling in oil thereby making the bread really soggy. The waitress took our order without writing it down as if she had good memory and sure enough our meals came out all wrong. People who asked for bacon got sausages and people who asked for pea meal bacon got actual bacon. 

Horrible management. I won't be back because their food is not worth the wait. The staff also lost their friendly smiles from before.. I'm not sure what changed. 

The table was sticky and cutlery wasn't washed. My knife had jam on it..  They clearly don't even have enough staff to keep the restaurant hygienic.

I don't understand how they can be so laid back and indifferent to the angry line waiting out on their patio. Congee Wong was way busier than them last night and was still able to execute fast and efficient service. 

ZERO stars."}
{"text":"Wanting brunch on a weekend, we searched for the best brunches near us and found that Uncle Betty's was top rated and close by! We arrived around 1:50pm on a Saturday and had no idea that the kitchen closes for brunch... (Yelp doesn't say that!) so we nearly got turned away. Thankfully they were nice enough to let us in very quickly if we ordered within the next 8 minutes (seriously!). At 1:55pm, we got our orders in and were excited to eat! 

I ordered the Betty's Benedict since I've been on a bit of a poached eggs obsession. I guess I glazed over the menu since I didn't realize that instead of the eggs (instead of sitting on an English Muffin) were served on a donut. DONUT. SERIOUSLY?! It was really good. Super hungry, I managed to nearly finish my entire plate and share my homefries with my brunch partner. 

Pretty generous portions and decent pricing.. We also grabbed a donut to go, but maybe I'll just stick to brunch next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Ate here with my boyfriend, we were planning on coming for brunch but arrived late. I ended up getting the mac and cheese and he had the ultimate hot dog. My dish was great, cheese and filling but a little bland for my taste. My boyfriend was satasfied with his choice. I'll be back to try breakfast and some dessert."}
{"text":"So we came here at 12:30pm on a Saturday. Waited 30 min to be seated. I ordered the eggs benny on a donut with a side of fries, and my boyfriend ordered the yam hash. My eggs benny was yum- the donut is what makes the difference. The fries on the otherhand tasted horrible. Weird texture, as if they were freezer burned, then fried, then left on the warmer for too long. My bf's yams were 75% burnt. Btw, its not hash in the typical sense. A better description would be yam home fries. (Aren't hashbrowns made with shredded potatoes? And not cubed?)
So yeah, donuts are good... that's about it. Not worth the walk from Eglinton station. :/"}
{"text":"Decent little Sunday brunch place - never can go wrong with eggs and sausage which is what I had. Big portions. Came here with my husband and a cousin of his to reminisce over old times. We shared the homemade donuts which was a-ok.

Stayed there for quite a while and no one bothered us which was nice. Service also a-ok - asked us what we wanted, got our orders and took away the plates."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating at Betty's. Unfortunately, I do remember the food being better from my 1st visit. 

The decor is awesome! I just didn't get the same cool vibe (they claim to have on their site) from the staff. Our server seemed to be in a rush when taking our order. He seemed to be that way with all the customers even though the restaurant wasn't busy. 

My friend had a milkshake and the ultimate grilled cheese and she said both tasted amazing. I'm happy she was satisfied. I had the meatball sub sandwich. I found it to not be very flavourful and it wasn't hot or that warm even. The fries were ok. 

I love diner food but I want it to taste amazing to be worth consuming so many calories."}
{"text":"Brunch

Ambience: 3/5  
Food: 3.5/5 (Notes: Blue berry pancakes and fries are amazing)
Service: 3/5 (Friendly)
Value: 3/5 
Repeat: Perhaps. It is a great brunch spot for locals."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on Saturday for brunch. Getting a seat for two was pretty quick! I had already taken a look at the menu and knew I was going to get the Breakfast in a Bowl which is their spin on a poutine. She ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese which was mac and cheese and pulled pork. An absolute heart attack! Nonetheless, food was very very yum!

In-terms of service, my friend noticed that it seemed some of the male servers didn't seem to care enough... a bit rushed? The ladies served us much better. What really made this review go from a 3 to 4 was the fact that they gave us some treats - not 2, not 3 but 4 FREE donuts! C'mon how can you not feel good about that?

The homemade donuts are absolutely delicious! If these were at my doorstep, I'd come by every few days for a coffee and donut!"}
{"text":"Came here after work for a glass of wine while waiting for traffic to die down. It's a pretty good time to show up because the diner was only half full and the server was very attentive. We had the Ultimate Poutine and the Crazy Donut. It was alright, your traditional comfort food."}
{"text":"Not good. 

The service was fine. The place was cute. Cute patio on the warm days. And far away enough from Yonge and Eglinton to not be caught up in the weekday hustle and bustle. The items were reasonably priced and on par with other places in the area.

But the food was just not good. My coworker and I couldn't place it but something about the food was off and was simply disappointing.  
I got the UB donut with eggs and peameal bacon and a side of home fries. The home fries were the best part, but they were very salty and tasted old. Actually everything on my plate tasted not fresh and reheated. 
After I felt hungry and dissatisfied and a bit nauseated. 

 I always wanted to try it and I had high hopes, but I wouldn't raise my hand to come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the service was painfully slow. The food is delicious if you can stand the wait."}
{"text":"After walking past this restaurant several times and thinking it looked really cute, I decided to give it a try for a weekend brunch.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  After being ignored by several employees, we finally caught the attention of a hostess to seat us.  We asked if we could wait for a seat on the patio (there was a table just settling its bill) but were told no, we had to take what was available.  We ended up sandwiched between two tables packed with children- my friend could barely squeeze past a stroller to get to her seat and I had to sit sideways to fit at the table.  awkward! We were in the back of the restaurant and the heat was oppressive.  

The menu was fine, there were limited options that would be considered healthy but lots of the usual diner fare.  The food was good and served quickly, the service was sub-standard.  It took ages to flag someone down to get a refill on my coffee.  

We ended up leaving pretty quickly because my friend was pregnant and couldn't tolerate the heat.  I was looking forward to finally checking out this place but was very disappointed.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Uncle Betty's is an adorable place with friendly staff and delicious food. The portions are a little small for the price but that is my only complaint!"}
{"text":"I had heard of Uncle Betty's while watching the food network and the old adage is true; don't believe everything you see on TV. This is a very average brunch place, they have a nice decor and menu, but the food quality is nothing special. It is packed because of its popularity so it is slower than average. I've been here twice now and find the food to be average at best, I don't think it's worth the wait or cramped seating to be honest."}
{"text":"Really busy on a Tuesday afternoon! I had the Ms. Piggy poutine and it was good but nothing amazing. It was also extremely oily and I finished only about half of it. The service was a bit slow but I like the ambiance of the restaurant, it's nice and relaxed. :)"}
{"text":"I came to Uncle Betty's after the food network hype has died down, so as a result I don't think the service problems mentioned in previous reviews for their weekend brunch exists anymore. When I went, the place was pretty quiet. However I was slightly disappointed with setting, cause the diner seemed a bit more worn out then I had imagined, but hey, the quality of the food is more important anyways. I ordered the eggs benedict which replaces the english muffin with their doughnuts which are made fresh daily. In addition, the hollandaise sauce incorporated lemon, which I thought was very clever cause it cut down on the savouriness of the dish making it less overwhelming and easier to finish. The choice of the doughnut was also clever because the sweetness (not too sweet though) complemented the saltiness of the peameal bacon and the tanginess of the sauce really well. However, though I found the experience satisfying, I'm not sure if it quite meets my personal \"You Gotta Eat Here\" standard in either flavour or presentation. However, I will happily return at other times to try out other items that aren't on the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"1. Waited ages to be seated, which is usually fine if the food is good, but the servers also pretended they couldn't see us for the first ten minutes or so, didn't offer menus for us to look at, nothing...
2. After being seated, waited ages for drink and food orders to be taken, and when the waitress did come around she was busy being talked at by her boss so I couldn't get a word in edgewise.
3. Food took ages to arrive, only for the order to be wrong.
4. Food was subpar at best. Mac and cheese was powdery and bland. Had to soak it in ketchup which I never normally do. Very unfortunate.

Waste of time and money. Stay home or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The good: home fries, donuts, pancakes, coffee. 

The bad: eggs were unseasoned and barely warm. Service was mediocre. 

The really bad: upon arrival of food to table, 2 pieces of toast fell off my wife's plate onto the table. The server used his hands to pick up the toast and put them back onto my wife's plate. The same server who was just carrying menus and wiping down empty tables. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I really liked it here. It feels like your walking into a 50s movie set. Great breaky deals and comfortable seating. Service was very personal and conversational. I like how they have a front patio which is nice for summer days. I had the sausage wrapped in egg a cheese and YUM it was amazing! I'm excited to check out other meals I like how the coffee was very good pricing for a nice cup of Java!"}
{"text":"No real complaints here. The food is good.  The service can be spotty if they're busy but they genuinely seem to be trying.  I can live with that!

Can't wait to bring my 7 year old next time.  The kids seem to love this place!  Fun desserts and bright, cheery decor is certainly part of it."}
{"text":"Uncle Betty's was one of a number of stops on my summer Ice Cream tour of Toronto. It was listed as one of the best in the city by some blogger who I've slowly learned knows nothing about ice cream. Sorry, don't write about it if you have no clue!

Uncle Betty's ice cream fell right in the middle of the pile. It's not the worst and it's not the best. It's really just fine. I would go here again if I just happened to be in the area and also just happened to be dying for ice cream at that very moment. Otherwise, there are a good number of better options worth the extra travel to find. My various reviews will reveal the best this city has to offer!"}
{"text":"FOOD
Comfort diner food with a whimsical twist. The menu reminds me of the food you can get at a carnival or amusement park... In meal form. Definitely try their made in house dreson donut (only 140 calories which is an added bonus!) I especially enjoy their eggs Benedict which has a dreson  donut to replace the usual english muffin as a base. The sweetness goes surprisingly well with the saltiness of the egg and hollandaise. Their pancakes are to die for. Light, fluffy, and huge. Try it with the chocolate chips! Coffee lovers, be glad to know that Uncle Betty's serve Dark Horse coffee. Tea selection is a bit skimpy though. 

SERVICE
It's hit or miss. Mostly it's a miss. I would've given this restaurant a 4 star rating if it wasn't for their spotty service. The servers are usually swamped as this place fills up fast, and lacks attention to detail. They're also so busy that it's hard to get their attention. When not running food, they're busy turning over tables, often leaving guests unattended to or forgotten. 

ATMOSPHERES
I don't often visit restaurants for their atmosphere but Uncle Betty's is an exception. It's fun, whimsical, and has a nice touch of classic diner. I love it. The fact that it's an older building also adds to the charm. The decor is bright and fun, and they have a cute little patio outside for summer time dining. 5 star in this category."}
{"text":"adorable place, cute servers, simple sweet menu. Wish i took a photo of my stuffed blueberry ricotta french toast , but by the time that cross my mind, it was half gone.  the place is worth trying at least once. if i lived in the neighbourhood, i probably be here every weekend."}
{"text":"Was a great dining experience.  Got there meatloaf sandwich to go.  Was a tiny bit hung over and this helped with the cob webs.  Will be back for more"}
{"text":"Really friendly (and funny) service. 
Food was good but i wouldn't say it was...amazing. It was a little pricey for what it was...but i'd support them again. Love the ambience and decor"}
{"text":"Amazing family restaurant in an area without many options for families

Great for brunch, lunch, dinner or just an ice cream treat or doughnut (they make their own!)

Nice patio in front - great spot to enjoy a cocktail

Owners are super friendly and go out of their way to welcome guests

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Adult milkshakes.  That should be an auto-sell.  But there is more!  We went here for a birthday lunch and had a great time!  I had the grilled cheese with pulled pork and onion rings.  The sandwich was really yummy - it was a tad soggy but when someone is soggy because there's so much goodness on top, I'm not complaining.  My vegetarian buddy found her sandwich tasty, too. 

But the real winner was dessert.  A sugar doughnut, cut in half, filled with Greg's marshmallow ice cream, topped with caramel, whipped cream and Skor crunchies on top.  I died, it was SO GOOD.

Our server was really nice and charismatic!  It was fun to banter with him.  Also, a totally hip but welcoming environment.  This place is a gem.  I hope to come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here, prices are reasonable. But the service is slow as hell, waited over half an hour for food. No sorry, or excuses for the long wait. There were only 3-4 other tables full in the restaurant. At least the service isn't rude. 

Food 4/5
Service 3/5"}
{"text":"Food is alright, came out cold. Had to return it. Service is absolutely horrendous. When we arrived there 3 groups ahead of us...There were 4 tables for 4 people open for 15 minutes until someone invited them to it. There was a table for 4 that just had empty kitchen bowls on it!! There has been a table for two uncleaned from previous patron for 10 minutes. Just really unorganized. This was on Sunday for brunch. FYI to all."}
{"text":"A great place for a patio breakfast.
I often search for a quiet place to have a good Saturday morning breakfast with my son (an infant), enter Uncle Betty's. Known for their donuts I had their take on my go-to breakfast Eggs Benedict. You guessed it, no English muffin; yes donut. It's sweetness was a refreshing take which I enjoyed. However it seems like UB is still poaching their eggs in the 80s because of the vinegar content I found on my plate. Nonetheless, 4 stars is nothing to sneeze at. A great atmosphere on the patio looking over Toronto's prestigious Yonge street will make a great morning for you and your infant son. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"No axe to grind, no bad service, no flies, no long wait. In fact, the atmosphere was cool, service was really good and the wait was not long, despite it being really busy. It's the food: it's overrated. It's just ok. Great texture; flavour - meh."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. The service was absolutely amazing and we enjoyed the charming and amusing waiter. My coffee cup was always refilled which I really appreciated. I had the breakfast in a bowl poutine which was really amazing - it was a perfectly sized portion. If you can, save room for dessert as they have a big selection of ice cream type desserts. We will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today and was not impressed with the food or the service. I was meeting a friend and arrived early. I walked in and there was a customer drinking coffee but no employee in sight. I sat down and waited a full 15 min before the waitress decided to come by. I wasn't impressed with the menu...not much variety. I went with the traditional two eggs breakfast. The sausages that came with were gross...like not edible gross. that being said the location and physical appearance of the place were good. However, considering there are tons of great places around there steer clear of uncle Betty's!"}
{"text":"The Ultimate Grilled Cheese was tasty for sure, but super heavy and greasy (more than I had expected). It's something worth trying but not something you'd order every time.

Overall I was happy with the food and service but it's REALLY STRANGE that they're basically closed from 2-3pm. If you have time to read my story... Came on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend just before 2, but we were turned away because they weren't seating anyone for brunch anymore, and their lunch/dinner menu doesn't start for another \"45 mins\". We decided to just walk around the area and came back for around 2:30. We were seated but they didn't actually take our order until 3:15. I don't understand why their kitchen needed an HOUR to switch menus, especially when they close at 5. Why not just extend brunch? Overall it was ok, just be sure not to be there for 2-3."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good: I live close by and do brunch almost every weekend, so I had high hopes for it after it was recommended by a friend. I ordered a breakwich with donut and a side of kid-size pancakes. I waited for an hour for my order to arrive (no exaggeration, I actually took note of the time). After asking about it a few times it finally arrived, but instead of a donut breakwich it was served on an english muffin: apparently they ran out of donuts... If I was told that before bringing it over I would have ordered something else or just canceled that part altogether. The waitress was very apologetic and offered a free sweet donut, but afterwards came back saying they ran out of those too. The couple next to me had also a very long wait for their order and the people at the other table were complaining as well. Not sure if they were having an off today or simply not enough staff, but unfortunately I will not be coming back. With abundance of awesome brunch places in this city, there are far better options."}
{"text":"fresh made donuts, twinkies are amazing. food is very good too. 
super cute place"}
{"text":"I usually don't complain about bad service, but this place was kind of disappointing in that aspect. We called beforehand to ask about the wait time (since it was a Sunday and we went during brunch), and the guy told us it would be about 15-20 minutes. When we arrived, I had difficulty opening the door because it was so packed. Someone told me that the guy (with white hair) will come take our names, so I didn't bother walking up to him. But after about 5 minutes, nobody came to us and a couple who just came in went up to tell the guy their names. I quickly followed, and when I got there, he was texting on his phone. I said excuse me, and he didn't respond. I repeated myself, and without looking up from his phone, he said \"one second\" and continued texting. Rude. He finally wrote my name down and I went back to wait with the crowd. I continued to see tables being cleaned but for some reason, he didn't seat us for a long time. Our server was nice but slow. The food was nothing spectacular. If you do decide to come, I would suggest trying the eggs Benedict. It is served on their own donuts and it tasted pretty interesting (in a good way). Other than that, their home fries were a bit dry and bland, pancakes were too dense, and the sausages were just alright. Perhaps there would be better service during less busy hours, but the food wasn't amazing enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"I'm sure they have some good stuff here that is worthy of 5 stars, but the big breakfast I got I wouldn't count as anything super special. It's a convenient location in the Yonge & Eg area, which is lacking in \"hip\" brunch spots as it is, so of course this one gets over populated at times. 

Went on the weekend and did not have a huge wait for a table of 4, but we did wait for about 10 minutes before even being greeted by a server. Food came out fairly fast, but my order was sent out incorrect (French fries instead of home fries). Took about 5 minutes to fix it though - everyone else was almost halfway done their meals by the time I got mine back. 


Coffee cups are super small for regular coffee - they are served in espresso/latte cups, so you get a few good gulps before you need a refill. We felt like when we did empty our cups, we were ignored because they wanted us to hurry up and leave so they could reseat our table. Perhaps if you greeted us after more than 10 minutes, the transaction would have been a lot faster. 

Table service was definitely sub par. No 2 bite check - it's a small restaurant, so just popping in on your way by our table to see if anything else is required shouldn't be that hard.


We were also a bit taken aback by the bill situation - we were there with another couple, in which our server brought over the bill asking \"who the lucky one\" was that was going to get the bill. I understand that in a fast paced restaurant you like to drop the bill in order to keep people from lingering, but there are definitely less awkward ways to do it. Our server did not ask if the bill was together, or separate - which makes for a super awkward situation. We are grown ups so we just split it in the middle, but I'm a bit appalled on a service level that our comfort as a customer was not taken into account here. 


Not sure if we will be back again - would rather drive elsewhere than go to brunch in my own neighbourhood if this is the only option."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch with my 6 year old and husband. Horrible food and horrible service. I don't think they were fully staffed because it took forever to get any service at all. The food was soaked in grease, the fries were limp and greasy and inedible. My husband's meatloaf sandwich had enough grease to lube a car and it tasted awful! Thankfully, my daughter's pancakes were good. 
Otherwise, horrible experience and we will not be back. Ever."}
{"text":"BLT Salad was crisp light with amazing taste. The diner does get busy so bring patience. Decor is charming with lots of colors. I would eat here again. I will try some other menu items and report back."}
{"text":"Great place, slightly understaffed but they did let us know while we were waiting to order. Staff was great though! 

Had the eggs Benny on a donut! Awesome"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant with plenty of room for improvement.

(1) The food was bad.  Ordered the two-egg breakfast.  No garnish, no flair, looked like something I'd make at home on a lazy day.  Sunny side up eggs were greasy, toast was soggy, three sad skinny little Jimmy Dean microwave-at-home sausages, and the french fries (*not* homefries, just ordinary shoestring fries = ?) were hard on the inside and soggy on the outside.  I ate the eggs and toast, but barely touched the rest.  

(2) General atmosphere of confusion.  Server forgot to bring us cutlery.  When we pointed this out, he said he'd bring it over, and didn't.  We asked someone else.  Several minute wait ensued.  It also took forever to get our bill.  I want to emphasize that this restaurant is not big, it was at most half-full (9-10 tables), and there were at least 6-8 staff of various kinds milling about the floor, so I'm at a total loss to explain the poor service.

(3) Busboy was wearing sandals.  Perhaps this is a matter of personal taste, but open-toed shoes on restaurant staff (except maybe on a patio when it's 30¬∞C and sunny) really bothers me.

I hope they're able to turn it around."}
{"text":"I first got interested in this restaurant because it has the word Betty and I name which is my grandmother's name. I figured any restaurant with that was going to be good.

Once I arrived I found the food was perfect, the coffee was amazing and they brought out crazy icy water in those perfect little fliptop bottles. I have these bottles at home and guests crazy love them  when you pull them out. 

We ordered breakfast which was perfect, everything about this restaurant I loved it. I could've spent a long time going over the menu but just order the first thing that went to my mind.

There is a Australian chap working there who refilled our coffee and water many times and then even gave us some free donuts as we left. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch over the weekend and was not impressed. 
This place is surprisingly packed, food is mediocre with a price that doesn't justify. I tried their home made donut....the texture was very moist.
I also had their french toast, it was dry and tasteless.

The service was quick and friendly, the windows were open which brought in a family of wasps."}
{"text":"Slow service, waiter didn't take our order until later.  Tons of wasps on the patio,  the restaurant did warn us.  Food was over priced,  ok quality.  Stay home and make breakfast, you'll enjoy it more"}
{"text":"Hubby decided to surprise me one day and so we read some yelp and ended up here. The food is interesting... the donut egg sandwich thing really is TINY. home fries wasn't all that great either. best part of my meal was the coffee.. won't come here again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised when they sat us fairly quick for Sunday brunch. Food took a bit too long in my opinion but it WAS busy. Our server was good at making us feel attended to despite the long wait."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Star rating should be right in the middle 2.5.

Their menu is definitely not for the health-conscious... and I don't think they have much if you're a vegetarian. They do have an extensive kid's menu so I guess this is an ideal place to take a child.

For the adults, this is where things get a bit pricey. The dishes here aren't cheap.  You're looking at around $13-15 for a dish which would be categorized as a sandwich, burger or meatloaf (or a mixed of the three).

The hot dogs count as a dish and they come just under $10. The hot dog topping variety centre around their own, New York and Chicago. For the New York \"Coney Island\" dog, they use Nathan's but I'm not sure if they use Lester's for the Chicago dog.

Anyways, I wanted to try one of their sandwiches with a donut as the bun but unfortunately they were out. I guess having it on rye bread is better for me.

Overall, I left full but not overly impressed with my meal. I also felt that some of these could be dishes would be just as good if I made it at home.

If any of my friends want to try it out because of \"You Gotta Eat Here!\", I'd probably go with them but on my own, I probably would not."}
{"text":"Was disappointed to be honest.  Saw the restaurant on YGEH and had high hopes.  The Service - was just so-so they weren't overly friendly and the food took a half hour to arrive.  I could understand if the place was busy but it was pretty much empty.  

The Food: The potato skins were waaay over cooked and were hard to cut through.  The egg/bacon poutine tasted good but there were egg shells in the egg.  The pulled pork on the sandwich was delicious though and real pop in a can is always good.  

I might try this place again for desert but I'll skip it for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Overall, an average diner. Service was friendly and the spaghetti and meatballs that I ordered was good. There should've been more spaghetti though, since the meatballs were really big and took up more than half the dish."}
{"text":"I want to eat here everyday and get fat from the food. The portions are delicious and huge, which is a problem because it becomes difficult to leave room for the amazing desserts. 

I had the amazing grilled cheese (sans meat) and then two scoops of ice cream (Oreo and Roasted Marshmallow) with a donut.

The kicker was when the owner came by our table after we ordered dessert with a plateful of actual roasted marshmallows, which went great with the ice cream.

It was a great meal."}
{"text":"The food is delicious with simple but effective flavors but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the female owner is incredibly rude and upon leaving we saw rats running out the back door of the restaurant. Would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, save your money."}
{"text":"Too sweet for my liking. The egg and donut mix did not sit well with my stomach. Maybe I'd come back for just the donuts, as they were yummy."}
{"text":"A good little diner just north of Yonge & Eglinton, Uncle Betty's has typical diner fare like All-Day Breakfast items as well as decent lunch options such as burgers, hot dogs. mac & cheese and poutine. It's simple comfort food, but its done right. I had the Betty's burger and it was cooked well. The prices were also reasonable. 

The Only negative is service was slow but it looked like there were only 2 people working that shift so it was understandable. 

The diner itself is a very small space with a few tables in the back area. A selection of various ice cream up front, as well as donuts. 

A solid diner for the area."}
{"text":"Uncle Betty's has been on my radar for some time now. Finally decided to pull the trigger and try it out this weekend. 

Ordered the ultimate grilled cheese, consisting of white and yellow cheddar cheese, mac n cheese, and meatloaf, with home fries on the side. 

The grilled cheese was delicious. This is the dish to order at Uncle Betty's if you're a cheese lover. It was quite rich, so you really need to be in the mood for a heavy meal. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummmm comfort food and ice cream! Grown up Mac and cheese with a side of Greek salad. I have never been offered Greek salad as a side and I was excited. Boyfriend had the cobb salad, big portion and also delicious."}
{"text":"We ate here last night on a whim for dinner.  Me, the husband and the 3 year old kid.  Why?  Because it looked family friendly - the restaurant was bustling with lots of family's with multiple kids.  That should've been a sign for me to turn us all around.  The noise level was so high, I couldn't hear myself (which is really unusual).  The food is o.k. - the nachos starter I had was fine (nothing to write home about).  My salad was the BLT - bacon, arugula, tomato - there was some avocado there, and 1 small bite of a tomato in the entire dish.  Strange to have 1 bite of tomato for a dish called the BLT.  Bacon wasn't crispy, either.  It was just...meh.  I just read online the complaints on waiting for the food, menus, etc.  I am afraid the complaints are true.  It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  The kid had a grilled cheese sandwich with fries.  The husband had the 2 egg breakfast for dinner.  The highlight of the evening was the ice cream bar, where we got the kid a scoop of Greg's chocolate ice cream with sprinkles on a cone for $2.75.  If you tell them in advance that you'll pay full price but don't want the entire volume of a kid's sized cone they'll do it; I appreciated their respect of my wishes.  All in all, I'll have to go to my usual fave diner in the 'hood - Good Bite, if I want the same kind of fare but with more flair."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure I want to know who Uncle Betty is (maybe he/she works in the kitchen?)

The ladies and I went to Uncle Betty's for Sunday Brunch. Even though we arrived late (past 2pm) the waiter was kind enough to let us order from the brunch menu anyway. 

I tried the Betty's Breakfast (2 eggs, toast, peameal, hashbrowns). I like that you can swap the potatoes to green salad and they don't try to charge you extra! 

Most of the brunch menu was under $10. Lunch looked a little pricier - $13-$14.

My food was pretty good, especially for the price. No complaints.

The service here is a bit of a gong show in a charming sort of way. They had A LOT of servers - 4-5 people running around serving 10-12 tables. The problem was, there was no cohesiveness and we had to answer the same questions multiple times from different servers. They were all so cute and friendly though, it was hard to be annoyed.

They also make a lot weird desserts with ice cream and donuts, if that's your thing. They have Greg's ice cream (yes!!!) and they make donuts in house. The donuts can be subbed in any of the breakfast and lunch items (eggs brunny on donuts?)"}
{"text":"Had to trek up to Yonge and Lawrence yesterday, and stopped into Uncle Betty's for a late lunch. It was about 3pm, and the place was pretty quiet. It's a cute spot, with kitschy colorful wall graphics and that awesome donut making machine smack in the middle of the space. There was stroller parking (nice touch), so I unpacked kiddo and we grabbed a table. Ohhhhh, if only something else had been open...

This place is cute, and the food was ok, but the service SUCKS. It sucks sooooo bad!! It was so frustrating! Here's a highlight: Waiter says \"extremely hot plate!!\" about a bowl of soup, then places it directly in front of my baby girl!!! Are you kidding me???? She of course then dunks her entire arm in it, and my mommy instincts kick in as I yank her high chair out of the way with my leg while simultaneously sticking her entire arm in my mouth to suck off the hot soup. (This is a true mommy instinct - it is always faster and more effective to lick your children than to try and towel them off. Always). Luckily, the soup really wasn't that hot, and she didn't touch the plate, just the soup. BUT JESUS DUDE, REALLY?? Doesn't every waiter know not to put this kind of thing next to a 16 month old??? In a place with stroller parking even?? Argh. He walked away without even noticing the chaos he'd created, he was none the wiser. And this was AFTER we had to physically get up and ask for a menu. After we waited forever for our food. After I ordered donuts before I even ordered food, and the waiter forgot that I even wanted them. After no one brought us any extra napkins, or a straw for my coke. Before we waited another 20 minutes for the bill. *sigh* It was a comedy of errors. You can pepper your language with \"absolutely!\", \"great choice\" and \"perfect!\" as much as you want, it doesn't make you a good server. 

The food was ok. Sweet potato fries were nice and crispy with just the right amount of salt, and kiddo totally mowed out on the creamy tomato soup. Meatloaf sliders were meh, but much cheaper than the meatloaf burger.The much hyped donuts were completely forgettable in every way. They were better than Little Nicky's. That's the only nice thing I have to say about them.

The owner was there, and seemed to be working so hard he didn't notice how poor the service was. I didn't have the heart to tell him we won't be back."}
{"text":"Saw on the food network.  Was excited to find out I lived down the street.  Been twice.  Service wasn't bad.  Food is a bit gimmicky..  It sounds like a good idea, but then it's just not executed very well. Just needs to work on the food a bit. I had the ultimate grilled cheese.  It was surprisingly very dry.  It's a good thing I like ketchup with my grilled cheese. My girlfriend had the eggs Benedict on the donut. Same problem.  Donut was just dry and not very flavourful... Was a bit disappointed.  Their ice cream wasn't bad!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day with one of my cousins as we were looking for somewhere along the Yonge St. Strip to enjoy lunch. After disappointingly finding our first choice had closed down (RIP Soho Bistro), we decided to try Uncle Betty's.

Yes, this place has been profiled on 'you gotta eat here' but I did not come in with any pre-expectations. Service was friendly and prompt. The menu is filled with comfort food classics. The dessert menu is to die for, we didn't actually try anything off there but I will in the future.

My cousin had one of their famous grilled cheese stuffed with cheese, Mac n cheese, and roasted vegetables. A tad big but delicious. I had their adult Mac n cheese and enjoyed it though after seeing the grilled cheese had some second thoughts. 

All in all, we had a pleasant experience and would not hesitate to go back (especially for dessert!)"}
{"text":"Quirky name, quirky food. Uncle Betty's standard brunch fare stands out not because of how they taste, but because of how they try. We had:

- Ultimate grilled cheese: Standard grilled cheese sandwich but with a chunk of meatloaf and a dollop of mac&cheese. Meatloaf tasted pretty good but mac&cheese was really bland (how is this possible?) and couldn't really taste the cheese part on the actual grilled cheese. The home fries were amazing though, with really good seasoning.
- Breakwich: Standard egg/cheese/sausage breakfast sandwich, except this one had donuts as the \"bread\". Sounds fun, but actually didn't taste any different.
- Donuts: They promote these as their \"famous donuts\" so expectations are high. Maybe in a different time (when there weren't so many good donut places in Toronto), these would stand out. Now you're left going: tastes homemade (which is pretty good), but unimaginative flavours and doesn't really stand out.

Overall 3 stars: 4 stars for trying something different, 2 stars for the actual taste. A try-once place.

One last tip: On weekends, come before 10am if you want to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"I would give it 1 and 1/2. The wait was long and the food was okkkeyy. Nothing special. I ordered their Betty's Breakfast and specifically asked the waitress if the bacon and salad/fries came with it. She said yes. So I ordered a salad coz I hate fries and a peameal. Both were extra and while it is fine, I would have simply preferred to know in advance. The waiter said it was on the Menu but I do not remember that. I could be wrong. 

It is one of those neighbourhood places that get popular due to vicinity. I am not sure how it ended on the Toronto Best 100 list. No different from Sunset Grill.

I think they need more waitressing staff too. They are too busy and while they are polite, you wait a long time for food and refills."}
{"text":"I headed here for some tea and snacks. Yummy doughnuts!! I'm not even a doughnut lover but I admit these were good. 
After serving me the tea and doughnut that was it. I actually wanted to order more doughnuts (I'm a bit of a glutton) but they forgot about me in there. It was the afternoon on a weekday. We were the only customers in there. I counted FIVE  employees.  Three were standing around chatting. The other two seemed to be busy in the back. After waiting for about half an hour my son started to get fussy, so we headed out. As I approached the counter the employees cheerfully said goodbye. Ummmm... Can I pay? One actually said I should have just left without paying. Yep. 

Summary: yummy doughnuts but the service sinks. Hey owners, do you guys read your Yelp reviews? I'm not the first person to point out there's a bit of a problem with this place."}
{"text":"This place is ok for ice creams but breakfast is not worth it, their special grilled cheese is extremely overpriced for what it is. Their service is not consistent."}
{"text":"So I've been to Uncle Betty's a few times in the past and I'll admit I wasn't blown away by their offerings. But I definitely saw a ton of potential, so when a brunch visit was suggested, I jumped at the chance to give the joint another chance.

I'm so glad I did.

After waiting about 15 minutes for a table, we were shown to a comfy spot near the back and I began perusing their brunch menu. I quickly landed on a ridiculous concoction that, if done right, had the potential to be seriously delicious: The Ultimate Grilled Cheese (\"Real White & Yellow Cheddar, topped with a slab of our homemade Mac & Cheese, your choice of Pulled Pork or All-Beef Meatloaf & drizzled with our own Roasted Garlic Aioli Served with Fresh-cut Fries or Home Fries.\")

(I went with the Pulled Pork option and opted for Home Fries on the side.)

The sandwich arrived a short time later and it looked glorious. It was the messy, melty masterpiece I was hoping it would be, and I tentatively took my first bite. Surely, I thought, it can't possibly taste as good as it looks.

It was better.

Everything in this sandwich worked. The pulled pork was tender and delicious (and certainly didn't taste like it had been sitting under a heat lamp), the mac and cheese was fresh and perfectly cooked, and it was all held together by a copious amount of ooey, gooey cheese. I mean, this thing was basically sandwich perfection.

(Sure, I felt a little sick to my stomach all afternoon, but good lord was it worth it.)

And although the 'wich arrived to the table piping hot, the home fries were room temperature (at best). But I couldn't possibly have cared less. All I cared about was cramming that delectable masterpiece into my mouth."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to check out Uncle Betty's after it sitting on my Yelp bookmarks for ages, labelled as \"EGGS BENNY ON A DONUT!!!!!!11\"

Uncle Betty's is located right smack dab between the Lawrence and Eglinton subway stations, so if you're commuting and not driving, you'll likely want to keep an eye on the weather because it is a bit of a walk from the subway to get here.

The vibe, from the d√©cor to the waiters and chefs, is some mix of modern hipster chic. I want to wait that our waiter was a bit \"playful,\" which my party was totally cool with, but I think could possibly come off to some people as rude.

Their donut special of a day was not exactly a donut but a... CRONUT!!! This threw a wrench into my plans of getting an eggs benny on a donut, because as soon as I heard the word \"Cronut\" I knew I needed to try one of these bad boys. The vanilla glaze was absolutely amazing, but with the cronut, the same way I feel with many croissants, while it was good, but probably would have been better if it was warmer. It was a teeeensy bit dry, also.

One of my girlfriends got their homemade chocolate twinkie, so I stole some bites;  this thing puts all other twinkies to shame. Moist, chocolaty, scrumptious. For only $2.50 a pop, these babies are worth a try if you come here.

As for the actual breakfast, it was a bit of a mixed bag. I ordered the \"big breakfast\" with scrambled eggs (to which the server verified, yes, scrambled), but they came fried. The server replaced them, but it did take a little bit, and they didn't keep the fried ones at our table for us to nibble on while we waited. The fruit cup that can come with your meal is quite small and lacking in variety. The French Toast (we tried both the stuffed & non-stuffed variety,) which I read some great things about, really was a let-down. Dry, bland (both the French toast and the filling), and the Maple Syrup container was leaking all over our table.

The pancakes, however, kick some serious butt. Many pancakes can be too dense and very one-note, but I had a chocolate chip pancake and it was pretty delicious. Moist, fluffy, and packing lots of flavor, these pancakes are worth gorging yourself on some carbs for.

Some items of note I didn't get to try but I NEED to come back for are: Ice Cream Sammich (on a donut,) and their boozy milkshakes. Yum. 

While a couple of things here fell flat, there were definitely some shining stars and I will be back - especially as the menu is full of awesome."}
{"text":"\"You gotta eat here!\"

I hate waking up early! I love to sleep in as late as possible, so waking up for a 1:30-2pm brunch was a miracle. But, I did it after seeing it on Food Network and John Catucci made it seem so awesome!!

It was a Saturday afternoon at about 1:45pm when the two of us arrived to this cute modern family diner. It was packed... kids, parents, young couples, elders. There was a couple ahead of us, and couple more small parties behind. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes before a table opened up. I noticed a chalkboard at the front painted beautifully with all the different drinks, desserts, ice creams of different flavours, and toppings (I was already debating on which ice cream to get for dessert!). Then, there it was!! The donut-making machine that was featured on the show!! But disappointingly, it was not in use.

The brunch menu consists of the typical steak and eggs, sausages, pancakes, etc as well as granola sundae, and cereal for kids. I came for their eggs benny on DONUT... but then I noticed the breakfast poutine! Then the breakfast dog?! Finally decided on:

Affagato: $4.50 (5/5 stars)
Vanilla ice cream topped w/ espresso shot. The slightly melted (not sure if it was intended) ice cream was perfection! This just may be the trick to get me out of bed. I would wake up early everyday if I can always start with ice cream and espresso!!

Frozen Hot Chocolate: $? (5/5 stars)
Not usually a frozen drinks fan, but if you are, then get this! Very simple, but very YUMMM!

Stuffed French Toast: $13 (4/5 stars)
Stuffed with ricotta and blueberry, maple syrup and fresh berries on the side! Control the sweetness over the ever-fluffy toasts yourself! However, it could use a bit more ricotta. But again, there's never enough cheese for me. Soo good!

Betty's Benedict: $12 (4/5 stars)
As seen on TV! Two poached eggs with peameal on top of 2 small donut halves w/ side fries. Perfect portion! At first, I was afraid it was going to be too sweet with the donut, but it was actually more like a mildly sweet, old fluffy country-style donut, so it all worked!

We were stuffed, and were about to pass on desserts. But, how could I after I feasted my eyes on the chalkboard at the front?!?!

Donut Ice Cream Sandwich: $5.50 (5/5 stars)
Exactly how it sounds w/ your choice of ice cream and one topping. The server recommended the ROASTED MARSHMALLOW ice cream w/ skor bits. SOLD!!

Service: (4/5 stars)
Slightly slower than I would like, but I guess they were slammed. Enthusiastic, helpful, patient, and all the staff seemed to be having fun!!

I was glad I did not get the breakfast dog I mentioned earlier, because I saw the table next to ours get it. It is simply a hot dog with a fried egg wrapped in it. Nothing exciting. As we were finishing up, all the staff were setting up for a giant kids' party of 50+ or something before they opened up for dinner. So i guess they host private events as well...

How can I not come back the place that served me my BEST BRUNCH EVER?!?! Actually, I don't usually have brunch often, but I am definitely coming back to check out their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Stop in  this place with friends for late lunch as they have patio and weather was nice.  But food disapoined. Sand in the salad. Burned meatloaf.  Dirty tables. Service was good. That's why I give two point."}
{"text":"It's somewhere you want to be stellar, but it's inconsistent at best. Some food is good (my wife enjoyed the Mac & Cheese, my meatball sandwich was good, and we haven't tried their desserts...), but some sides arrived cold, and each time I've been here the service seems slow, disorganized and inattentive."}
{"text":"My 6 year old son and I love watching the food network, so after seeing uncle bettys diner being featured on the show \"you gotta eat here\", we decided to head there the next day.
The diner is cute, has a old feel to it. The donuts being displayed in the front cash beside the icecream freezer didn't look freshly baked like it said it wasm
We sat down for lunch and my son orderd chicken fingers, he was very hungry. I ordered the pulled pork  mac and cheese sandwich, I saw on the show. The waiter also recommended I get that sandwich. So I was excited to eat, and we sat patiently for our lunch. It did take a while, and there was only 3 other tables that were almost done their food. We still waited 30 minutes.
Our food came, and my sons chicken fingers wernt edible. They were extremly dry and had no seasoning. My son was so disappointed lol, but like the trooper he is he ate somewhat of it. When the waiter saw my son wasn't thrilled he came over and asked if he liked the chicken fingers. I politly said \"no they have no flavor, they taste burnt\", then the waiter was like \"oooooh that's cus its breaded from captn crunch cereal\". That was it.
My sandwich was very disappointing for $ 14.00. The bread was so soggy from all the oil dripping off the cheese that wasn't from the mac n cheese, and the pulled pork was really sweet. The first two bites were ok, after that I was forcing myself to eat it. I felt really gross and just asked for the bill. I don't eat a healthy lifestyle at all but that food was a heart attack waiting, I never thought I'd think like that for food lol.
Anyways just me and my sons food and soft drink our bill came up to 50.00. How? I have no clue, and I tipped 5. Not my cup of tea. Waste of money."}
{"text":"The donut ice cream sandwich was amazing. Our server was cheerful and awesome.

The owner came around and gave us shots of liqueur and wished us a merry xmas. Great service, great dessert - will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, ruined by rude servers. My friend and I went there on a Friday night. We were told to sit wherever we wanted and then when we proceeded to sit down at a table near the front, were told to move to the back because \"it was easier for them\". Female server who was helping us allowed us to ask one question each before she began to run away (restaurant wasn't even half full) and we had to call our questions after her as she kept moving. Food took way too long to arrive, bill was slapped on the table before we asked for it. We didn't know the place closed at nine and were finishing dessert at five after. Nobody told us anything, they just rudely mopped us out of the place. We had barely stood up from our chairs before both servers started to mop under them while we were still standing there. HONESTLY?!?! It was 9:15. The manager/owner seemed to be fine with this as he was placidly sitting nearby. The food was better quality than I would expect from a diner but not good enough to outweigh the lousy service. Plus it was FREEZING - I had to put on my parka halfway through the meal."}
{"text":"Uncle Betty's is an ok neighbourhood joint, serving comfort food classics with a twist. They get brownie points for serving Greg's ice cream. 

Brunch menu I found was a bit lacklustre though and I wasn't too impressed with the daily omelette. It was ok, but it didn't stand out as smack you on the head great, but it was serviceable if slightly over cooked. 

The breakfast sandwich looked ok, if bit unassuming. But it was small and little sad & lonely on its plate with the side salad coming along a bit later. 

Price point was ok - but I think I was expecting a more presentation along with the food. 

Service was so-so, a bit hurried, since they have a steady table turnover; which is great. But I don't think I will come out of my way to come here next time with friends, and only if I find myself in the area and I want Greg's coffee toffee ice cream."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I go for the homemade donuts on my cheat day.  We all need an Uncle Betty's cheat day.  Love the ambiance and the waiters can flirt and give it as well as take it - sass with the hash!  We always have a good time, the food it always great and too much.  A great brunch place we love to visit when calories are not a concern (CHEAT DAYS!)  Take your friends, go early - there is a wait sometimes but worth it - so wait.  Very family friendly.  Yumm"}
{"text":"Second time here. I really enjoy the food, service and they are great with my kid's allergy.

Today I had the awesome blueberry ricotta French toast again. Delicious.

My kid had the grilled cheese with a fruit cup. She wrapped it up with a kiddie scoop of ice cream.

Love that they carry Greg's ice cream, although I didn't have room for it today.

Washrooms in the basement are plentiful and clean."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food is hit or miss, though they do serve large portions. Staff is also hit or miss. Loathe the decor. Have only been for breakfast. It's where I go when I want breakfast out, but am too lazy to go somewhere better."}
{"text":"I can go back to this restaurant again and again.
I've tried their meat loaf dinner and the porky pie and I think they are definitely as good as they get. The meats are tender and juicy and they serve them to you hot and steamy. I appreciate also the wide variety of their menu, especially of their desserts!
I've tried their donut ice cream sandwich for dessert. They were heavenly! Their home made donuts are sweet but they're not heavy. 
The servers are pretty sweet too! At the end of a dinner there, they gave my boyfriend and I some of the leftover donuts to go for free ^_^
My only complaint is their HUGE serving size. So if you plan to try their desserts, I suggest you share a meal with your company to leave room for it."}
{"text":"Arrived at 1:40pm on a Sunday just to get flat out rejected from the restaurant, didn't even try to seat us. 

The host claimed that their kitchen was \"closed\" and will not take requests until 3:30pm, upon which they would re-open and their lunch would start.

1. Where does it say that there is a midday break? Their business hours say 8:30AM TO 8:00PM continuous. No where does it say there is service stop of any kind. I checked yelp, website and google.
2. We were thinking of going there for brunch; admittedly, we did arrive a little close to the end, but the website menu says service is available until 2pm SHARP. Which we fully complied with, so why would they close early?
3. How can a kitchen just close down during late-lunch hours and not have any other options? 

Absolutely despicable."}
{"text":"Uncle Betty's is OK. The staff was very friendly, service was prompt and my coffee was always full. I hesitated when ordering the eggs Benedict on a donut, but our server reassured me that it was delicious and definitely seemed genuinely interested in knowing (and hoping) I enjoyed it once I took my first bite.

I was more apprehensive about the calories in the donut than the flavour combination but again, our knowledgeable and invested server was able to recite the nutritional value of the donut, and also how it compared to that of an English muffin. Anyway, the eggs Benedict was fine. The flavour was exactly what I expected and I wasn't OMGing over it. To be honest, I've had better at the Sunset Grill. Maybe they could've toasted the donut? Anyway, I ordered the salad side option which was simple, lightly dressed but again, nothing notable.

My friend ordered the omelette of the day and said it was very good: light and fluffy.

The staff were very good at letting us chill out and chat after our meal... always offering more coffee and making small-talk. We left when we noticed how busy the place was getting and that our table would soon be needed. 

Uncle Betty's is not outstanding. It's cute. The staff is friendly and efficient. The food is alright. This is definitely a great family-friendly environment and there were may small children brunching with parents. I'd certainly recommend it for those looking for something homey and welcoming with some kitchy food pairings.

All in all, it's a good place, not a great place. If you just want a great hang-over breakfast that's tried-and-true, head to the Good Bite across the street."}
{"text":"Simple food, brought to you with humour and kindness.

Best feature is the home made donuts."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Great variety on the menu. The donuts are amazing. My friends are I did not have reservations but we were seated almost right away and service was good. Definitely want to go again."}
{"text":"This place is actually great! I find Midtown to be full of hit and miss type of places, so that is why Uncle Betty's sticks out so much more - because it is consistently great.

I have been there a bunch of times at this point, and have never been disappointed with their food or service. I like the fact that they try to incorporate donughnuts into some of their bennies, and their Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich is absolutely decadently amazing. I would recommend getting the pulled pork sandwich - the pork is perfectly smooth, and has no fat. Having doughnuts and ice-cream as well, makes any trip there even more so gluttonous and delicious. 

And, come on, that name is just too good. Just gives a good vibe. Feels like it's edgy and modern, yet the cosiness and comfort of the space make it approachable and inviting. Definitely will be going back there again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Two stars is generous. The eggs Benedict had barely any hollandaise sauce. When I asked for more, it came out cold. Tiny portion overall... Overcooked home fries. If I hadn't been completely starving I would have sent it back and ordered something else. 

Won't be back unless its for ice cream or donuts."}
{"text":"Was really pumped to find out that the location was so close to my best friend's apartment on the day we watched \"You Gotta Eat Here\" on FoodNetwork. We didn't even wait until the end of the segmentm, we immediately got on our coats and were out the door. 

For a newish location (all I know is the google maps photo is of Lolo Restuarant or something, not Uncle Bettys) the place kind of seemed run down, as I noticed paint chipping off the walls. But no matter, all I care about is good food in the end. My BF and I were really pumped about the desserts, so we decided to just share an entree. Holy over-priced, especially for a diner - 14 bucks for a grilled mac and cheese sandwich and fries (think McDonald's fries, but overcooked)! Meatloaf in the grilled cheese was delicious, but the mac and cheese was dry, and in the end I ended up using a lot of ketchup to moisten it up.

Service here, as others have mentioned, is very lacklustre. A grilled cheese took more than 25 minutes to come out. Water that they gave us tasted/smelt mildly of cleaning fluid. When it was finally time for dessert, I choose the Twink Eh Sundae (homemade chocolate twinke with ice cream). The menu doesn't list the ice cream flavours, so when I asked \"What flavours do you have\", the waiter's response was \"There's 16, I'm too lazy to list them\". I kind of laughed but after a few seconds of the waiter just staring at me in silience, I realized he had no intentions of even making a suggestion or hinting at flavours. In the end I asked 'well......do you have Raspberry, or any fruit flavours?\". His answer was \"Raspberry it is\" and walked away. Really guys? 

The only saving grace of this place is that the ice cream is fabulous. The Twink-eh which I was really excited about after seeing how it was made on TV was very dry and just tasted like a betty crocker cake you'd make out of a box. 

Won't be back again unless it's to pop by in the summer to get a scoop of ice cream to go."}
{"text":"Super cozy, retro, family style place! I came here for Sunday brunch, there was a line as per us usual but I got in pretty fast. 

The menu has all your brunch favourites and then some. I found the staff to be accommodating and friendly!!! Everything that walked by looked tasty and large portions. I was quite happy that the prices weren't bad and the size of the plates were hefty !!! 

I for sure will return, and get an entire portions of pancakes they were OH SO GOOD!! I actually would like to try everything.... mmmmmmm

PS
They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Old fashioned Chocolate Milk Shake!!!
Amazing...
Enormous Greek Salad with REAL Chicken Breaston freshly cooked and lightly seasoned...
One of Toronto's hidden gems!
Quiet, great atmosphere... very clean."}
{"text":"I like this place. Great for breakfast and for lunch. The doughnuts are delish! The staff are super personable. 

I just wish they were open earlier. If they opened at 8:00 I would use them twice as much. I wanted to go today :("}
{"text":"I saw this place mentioned on 'You Gotta Eat Here' & wanted to see what it was about... 

We came for brunch on a Sunday & it had a good number of people there but it wasn't too busy where we had to wait long for a table. 

The service is mediocre. We waited for a bit to be greeted, when we had problems with our order (which I will get to) we waited & when I wanted to top off my coffee we waited. & when I say we waited we WAITED - more than 5 minutes. 

I ordered the Nathan's dog wrapped in egg & my boyfriend ordered the grilled cheese with meatloaf & bacon. My order was no big deal except that they use Nathan's dogs. Now, if you've ever been to the states Nathan's has AMAZING hot dogs.. So that's what helped me decide.. The meal itself was ok, I found the hot dog bun to be really greasy. The home fries were pretty good. They forgot the bacon for my boyfriend's sandwich & when we tried to get someone's attention we couldn't find anyone & that's where we waited. At this point the tables that were filled with people when we first walked in had already paid & left, so I'm not sure where the staff went. 

He got French fries with his meal & those were really good. The meat loaf also tasted good. He was pleased his sandwich was not covered in gravy or soaking in it. 

I noticed that there were a lot of flies in the restaurant & a few bees hovering above the maple syrup. Not really appetizing to see. It was entertaining though to watch a girl cleaning cutlery swat at the bees using whatever cutlery she had in her hand.

We ordered dessert after the meal & at that time they also brought the bill. I had to ask three times to get my coffee topped off & it was only topped off when we got the bill & dessert. 

The dessert was meh.. My donut was cold & these were featured on that show. These donuts were no big deal; I'd rather a Tiny Tom's. My boyfriend ordered the chocolate Twinkie that was supposed to be filled with buttercream. I don't know if they've had twinkies but their whole being filled with buttercream was not filled with butter cream. He didn't get to the buttercream until the end of the Twinkie & it was this small like of it along the side. I may say the Twinkie is  very chocolatey which was pretty good. But if you're saying its filled with buttercream - FILL IT. 

The bill came to $36 before tip. I'm not sure how I feel about that considering the food was ok & not as great as advertised on tv & the service needs improvement. 

I would eat here again but only to try out the dinner meatloaf, but even then, I am hesitant to do so. 

For large groups, they have an 18% gratuity - watch out."}
{"text":"We went for a breakfast on a Sunday, has to wait 15 mins to get a seat. The staff was courteous. We ordered the eggs Benedict, the omelet and the stuffed French toast. The food was good, nothing amazing. They can work on their portion sizes and maybe have some more vegetarian options. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"Aweful food... Ridiculous service... They served the food after 45 minutes waiting, and guess what... Wrong orders for 2 out of 8 ppl!!! They offered to fix our orders while we have the home fries and GUESS WHAT... We never received the food... And we were charged for home fries... With tip included... Do NOT waste ur time and money and just have a simple scrambled egg at ur home"}
{"text":"I went there today for brunch after hearing good things. The food was just ok and the service was terrible. 

Our server only talked to us once to order and then didn't stop by at all to ask how things were going or if we wanted anything else. Our glasses (everything- water cups, juice cups, coffee cups) were empty for a good 20 mins before I was finally able to get his attention to refill on any kind of beverages. Had to wave my arms and shout a couple times for him to finally notice us. 

I ordered eggs Benny. It was edible, but over cooked and the doughnut it's served on isn't very special. Waited 45 minutes for THAT. 

Won't be eating here ever again. This place sucks and the service was such a negative experience."}
{"text":"I had built this place up in my mind.  Not sure if it was the name, location, look.  I thought it would be a 4, maybe even a 5 star place. It ended up be pretty good.  
I had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was good.  Decent size piece of chicken with tomato, avocado and bacon.  All served on a very fresh ciabatta bun.  The fries were about  a 2 out of 5.  They had potential (they tasted good!), but were cold.  And, it wasn't just my dish.  I was with two friends and their fries were also very cold. We were there for lunch and it wasn't overly busy.  Maybe they made a ton of fries expecting a big crowd  and they ended up just sitting...waiting.
The service was also lacking.  It took a very long time for our food to be served.  The servers were nice enough, but seemed like they wanted to go home.  They all looked very uninterested.  We arrived for what we thought would be about a one hour lunch.  It ended up being over 1.5 hours!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times in the past, and with each visit I received fantastic service that was attentive and fast. On my most recent visit, it was the complete opposite. We went for sunday brunch, so as expected it was busy and there was a 30min wait. However, right off the bat it was a bad experience. The man with white hair who was seating people took around 10mins to come to the door and put us down on the list. He also looked unhappy the entire time and was not very welcoming. When we finally got seated, we were not asked about drinks/water and when we were ordering, we were told several items on their brunch menu were unavailable and that their lunch menu was unavailable to order from. It would've been nice if they had mentioned this while we were waiting in line or within the first few minutes after seating us. When a few cups of water were brought to us, they were in paper cups strangely, while other tables had regular plastic cups. Not a big deal really, but it would've been nice if the waitress had acknowledged this. 

On the plus side, the food was fantastic as it always is. The ultimate grilled cheese was awesome as it was the previous time I had it and the blueberry pancakes were nice and fluffy. Unfortunately our waitress was absent throughout our entire meal. Not one check-in or refill of water or coffee. I get that it was Sunday brunch and it was busy, but this is what they do every week. Probably the worst serviced meal I have ever had, and as a result, I will never be back here. Unfortunate as the food here is quite good."}
{"text":"I recently went here for brunch on a Sunday. I had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated, which neither my friends or I minded. 

The chocolate chip pancakes were absolutely delicious. The coffee was not very good, especially if you (or your friends) are coffee snobs. 

The service however..... We had to ask 3 or 4 times for us to get water, cutlery, an extra fork, more coffee, etc."}
{"text":"Went to Uncle Betty's diner as it was recommended to us by friends. I don't mean to sound like a food snob. But for these prices I would've expected better quality & nicer decor. It's a pretty casual atmosphere. I ordered the Uncle Betty dog & hubby ordered the Chicago because they were out of the chili for the Coney dog. We shared sweet potato fries & onion rings. The sweet potato fries were ok, the onion rings had some kind of spice I didn't like, so hubby at the rest. The Uncle Betty dog is basically a dog with carmelized onions & mushrooms. It was good, but nothing really memorable. Same for hubby's dog. For dessert we each had a powdered donut, which I thought was quite dry & not fresh tasting at all.  We didn't stay long after eating. It's kind of small & they have lots of tables crammed into the space. So it's not a comfortable place to just hang out after a meal."}
{"text":"The food is below average (cold eggs and unseasoned home fries).  The atmosphere is retro and decent. 

But the service is SLOW (waited over 25 minutes for eggs when the restaurant only had 3 tables with people).  

Worst of all?  The manager!   I returned a juice because it tasted bad.  The manager ended up coming to the table, asking what's wrong with it, telling me he drank it himself earlier and enquiring about what drink I'd like to purchase to replace the juice.

Anyway, the food is less than satisfying, the portions are small and the service is slow.  The manager hovers over you and is almost abusive."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch menu. Highlights include the breakfast in a bowl, Grilled Cheese, and Breakfast sandwich. House made donuts are fantastic and the roasted marshmallows ice cream is perfect. 

Also the wait staff is consistently friendly, helpful and entertaining. Only place I've been convinced to order dessert when I originally had no intention of having any. And it was a good decision. Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"We went to Uncle Betty's for brunch today.  The restaurant was a bit chaotic when we were there - very busy, mostly with families with small children.  It was so loud that I could barely hear anything my dining companions were saying.  

Our service was very spotty but overall I was not impressed.  Our friends arrived early and already had their coffee.  After my son and I arrived, he didn't bother coming to the table for at least 15 minutes if not longer.  We had to get up and call him over.  We asked for more coffee but he didn't come back for at least 10 minutes so I had to again flag him down and call him to our table to ask for the coffee which I assumed he had forgotten.  Instead, he said 'I told you I was making a fresh pot\".  He brought my latte without a spoon so I had to flag him down for a spoon and some Splenda.  I was not impressed with the way he spoke to us and I think he could tell I was upset because he would periodically come by after that and with false friendliness (at least that is how it felt to me) ask us if everything was ok or if the food was \"worth the wait\".   I also had to ask him three times for ice water.  

We did wait what seemed like a long time for our food.  Someone from the kitchen (I think it may have been the owner) came out with it.  He was very nice and attentive and I when I mentioned that I was still waiting for my water, he made sure I received it.  I felt bad for him because I know how difficult it is to run a successful restaurant but I think the biggest problem he faces is his servers.  They seems completely disorganized and disinterested.  

The food was generally fine but nothing blew me away.  I ordered three eggs over medium with a side salad instead of potatoes.  The salad was a nice size with a light dressing.  The yolk on one of the eggs was broken and fully cooked and since I hate my eggs like that, I asked for it to be replaced. I don't know if I would have bothered saying anything if the service was good but I was generally annoyed with our waiter so I asked for it to be replaced.  This was done promptly and cooked properly.  

The blueberry pancakes were good and the omelet of the day was also good and a nice size.  The bacon was crispy but the potatoes were not well done as I had requested. I thought that the breakfast smoothie was quite small for the price.  

I made a special trip from North Toronto to try this place.  I can't see myself doing that again."}
{"text":"As a straight laced, fiscally conservative yet socially progressive dude with an appreciation for all kinds of subcultures, I really wanted to like Uncle Betty's. I'll spare you all the hollow 'some of my best friends are...\" references, but damnit Janet, any business that combines an Archie Comics heroine with a sweet handlebar moustache has to be good, or at least interesting, right?

I did a bit of homework before visiting Uncle Betty's yesterday. I read about it in a community newspaper (and was mildly disappointed to learn the more mundane origins of the name), and checked the place out on Yelp. The two reviews covered the spread. One diner had a great experience, the other was bitterly disappointed. 50-50 odds. I've tried worse and been pleasantly surprised. 

I called ahead. Yes, they were open. No, they didn't take reservations. Yes, we'd see them shortly. Hot patootie, we have ourselves a destination!* 

So I met my equally button-down, fiscally conservative yet socially progressive family members for lunch. I secretly hoped to walk into a diner and be greeted with Rocky Horror Picture Show abandon. 

It was a horror show all right.  If you remember the dinner scene from that movie, you'll appreciate the reference.

We were seated immediately, at a table way in the back of the restaurant, underneath oldie-blaring speakers. We waited while Phil Spector's wall of sound crashed into us again and again and again, making conversation impossible. No coffee. No menus. Not even water. For 30 minutes. Service was less personal and more triage. Frustration would mount, and we'd flag the nearest server as she dashed between tables. it's a shame the stereo mix never hit the Beatles \"Helter Skelter\". It would be a suitable anthem. 

Coffee, once it arrived, was hot and strong. Menus, once they arrived about 15 minutes later, were disappointing.

*After reading the Yelp reviews, it never crossed my mind to ask whether the full menu was available. It wasn't, We were limited to four or five brunch items. This enraged one member of our party, who'd already had breakfast, and by 1:30 PM was ready for something heartier. 

Of the limited items on offer, one member chose the stuffed french toast, while the others opted for Uncle Betty's version of eggs Benedict, served on a halved donut. 

We waited. 

Again. 

For forty five minutes. 

I appreciate that Uncle Betty still has a few issues to work out, but if they plan on limiting our options, they'd better execute them properly and in a timely fashion.  

The eggs arrived properly poached and the peameal bacon was serviceable, if a bit underdone. Promised lemon hollandaise sauce had split during the journey from the kitchen. The dissolving donuts underneath were a mess; better to transfer the rest of the dish onto the accompanying crispy french fries and call the lot \"breakfast poutine\". 

The long-delayed stuffed french toast sandwiched insult between injuries, cloyingly sweet and dry and stone cold. 

The manager asked how our meals were. We answered. He told us that he would pass our feedback along to the kitchen. We didn't see or hear from him again. Perhaps he was attacked in the freezer by an axe-wielding alien transvestite scientist. If so, the killer got him before he could   remove the offending item from the bill.

Uncle Bettys offers house-made twinkies and Greg's ice cream. I love Greg's ice cream, but give it a pass. At this rate, it might show up for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

I ordered the Ultimate grilled cheese sandwich, with pulled pork. ($16)
This grilled cheese sandwich was a layer of mac and cheese, layer of pulled pork, with another layer of cheese all squished in 2 layers of bread. Each layer had its flavor, but all together it lacked flavor. I was actually hoping the pulled pork would be more saucy and would add some bbq flavor to the sandwich. It was tasty, but felt super greasy which gave a really heavy feeling after eating half the sandwich. I would not recommend eating the entire sandwich alone! Definitely calories overload. The dish came with a choice of fresh cut fries or home fries - I had the fresh cut fries. The fries were so good! It sort of tasted like Mcdonald's fries!

My boyfriend ordered the Betty's Benedict ($12)
Eggs benny served on peameal bacon, and instead of an English muffin it was their famous donut instead. I personally didn't like it because I'm not a fan of peameal bacon, and I also thought the donut was too sweet. One thing I didn't like was they served one of the eggs benny with the egg yolk already broken with the yolk running all around the plate. Also, the plate not served hot or warm, but slightly cold - a big negative for me. My boyfriend had the home fries as a side, which had the same flavor as the home cut fries but it was more potatoey. 

Tip: if you leave your name down on the waiting list, and the staff tells you it's going to be a 30 min wait, I wouldn't fully trust him and would hang around and not wander too far. That day I went, he pretty much told everyone 30 min wait but if a table is available and he calls your name and you're not there, he moves on. He also doesn't loudly call names so I would check in here and there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Came for brunch and dinner. Had their adult grilled cheese loved their homemade meatloaf and Mac and cheese. Their dessert was also great too. It was their doctor nut with Skor Bits and toasted Marshmallow Ice Cream."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when my friend tolde we were eating at a placed called \"Uncle Betty's\". I was very surprised though!

The interior looked like a place that's more for kids, plus only families with young children were eating there when we arrived.

I had the ultimate poutine thing, and did not enjoy it. Too many flavors in my mouth, and it was all greasy.. It was my own fault for going with the waiter's recommendation!

My friends liked their food though, plus the waiters were super nice. However, don't think I'll be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"For both treats and a meal, I love Uncle Betty's! 

I find the brunch menu to be a welcome deviation from the standard brunch fare. You can go with their classic breakwich, small but decadent because one of their signature homemade donuts is the \"bread.\" Or you can opt for something a little heartier. I had the blueberry stuffed French toast--meaty slices of French toast stuffed with blueberry infused ricotta cheese. SO good. So BIG! (but my pregnant self still managed to eat it all!). I took some sausage on the side because, well, I'm pregnant and sausage is delicious--it was average/good sausage, I'd say, and a nice complement to the sweet French toast. 

My husband had their special omelet -- pulled pork. He said it was good and different, but he was a bit underwhelmed (though I think it was fall-out from going the wrong way in the Great Brunch Debate of savory vs. sweet). I will agree with some reviews that the service wasn't exactly speedy, but we found our server to be polite and helpful. 

For treats, their ice cream selection is fine. But what you really want is their donut ice cream sandwich. You can't exactly eat the thing like a sandwich--too messy. But off a plate it is just as satisfying. I went with a chocolate ice cream - Cinnamon donut combo. I highly recommend! Delicious! 

Overall, for a somewhat quirky experience (certainly quirky food) in this otherwise poshy neighbourhood, I highly recommend Uncle Betty's!"}
{"text":"Average diner.
Not very big portions.
Foods average.
The server was fine..
Nothing special about this place at all!
They do make their own doughnuts but I didn't even want to try them because the place is so over priced. 

The food was fine but like honestly we hardly got any home fries or toast..
The cappuccino was ok.. nothing great."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to come here since they usually have good food but sadly we were disappointed.

We ordered poutine and the cheese curds weren't even melted and mac and cheese wasn't a big portion.  The kids version is even worse.

Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We waited in line for 45 minutes before being seated during which we overheard a table comment to the server that they had been waiting over 45 minutes for their food. We looked around at all the tables and realized that most of them were empty and had drinks only. We then asked our server and she, indeed, confirm to us that food would be another 45 mins to an hour. I understand that restaurants can be overwhelmed and can get behind on orders, but to not inform your guests is just irresponsible. I felt especially bad for tables that had young children.

I would recommend Mars Diner down the street. When we walked in, the server informed us that there was a 4 to 5 minutes wait. That's what I call good customer service! And the food was not bad either!"}
{"text":"I first found out about this place through a friend that lives in the neighbourhood and found their food to be delicious.  I've since used their Chicken Pest Sandwich and the Panko crusted onion rings as a peace offering after a fight with my girlfriend (It really works and she now wants to start a fight everyday to get one).

The Spaghetti and Meatballs is also out-of-this world!"}
{"text":"I still don't know how I feel about the name.

Anyways...

Good
- the chocolate twinkies are good
- the milkshakes are good (but then again it's tough to screw up a milkshake)
- nice little patio on quiet section of Yonge and Eg
- friendly staff

Bad
- the coney dog was awful. Like awful. And they have the nerve to charge $13!

I sure hope the rest of the offerings on their menu are better than their coney dogs..."}
{"text":"Area is great and I was excited to try it since it looked very neighborhood hidden gem feel. I was wrong! 
Seated quickly which was great. Waitress brought us water in hot glasses, didn't even ask us if we wanted something to drink. Menu was pricey but figured it must be good with the creative menu items. Wrong! I had the stuffed French toast that came almost dark brownish with edges burnt. The toast was hard to even cut like it was dried out. The ricotta/blueberry was just put between the dried pieces of bread not stuffed and it lacked flavor. Just tasted like cheese whipped with blueberries and was watery not creamy. Fruit on plate was only good thing. I did eat at least one piece of French toast thinking it must be burnt for a reason...nope. Waitress never came to even ask how the food was and only came back after I asked the hostess for the bill. Then sent someone else and only stopped to add more water after plates were cleared. 
My friend has eggs Benedict which was okay. Home fries were really good just a little undercooked. Cute place though. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped into Uncle Betty's because I was curious to try it out and in the neighbourhood. Ordered the pulled pork sandwich which turned out to be pretty mediocre. It was bland on taste and a bit of a soggy mess compared to some others I have tried elsewhere. Fries were ok if only a bit on the soggy side. Neither item was served very hot. Service was slow even though there were less than a handful of people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it.  Kids meals were big enough to satisfy two seven year olds who eat lots.  Our meals were really good.  Meatloaf is yummy."}
{"text":"Grilled Mac and cheese with meatloaf nuff said small little joint with good service nice staff."}
{"text":"OH MY YUM!

Diners and comfort food are my weaknesses. Uncle Betty's is no exception. I grabbed lunch with a friend and wanted to go somewhere north of Bloor, since I never venture uptown or midtown. This place delivered! I had the ultimate grilled cheese which was heavenly! Pulled pork and mac'n'cheese stuffed in it! I also tried the scrumptious donuts! Mmmmm!

Our server was super friendly and our food arrived in a timely matter. Only downside, was coffee took forever to get refilled and I didn't get a spoon for the longest time nor did I bother asking for milk or cream. Also they didn't refill our waters... Little things....

But I'm definitely returning, my friend had the chili cheese fries and they were GOOOOD!

So. Much. Too. Choose. From.

Brunch next time!!!"}
{"text":"Prior to going to uncle betty's for brunch this morning I had read all the reviews, so I was prepared for a bit of a wait (we had a group of 6 and wait 15-20 mins for a table) and for service to be slow (drinks came quickly, but it did take quite a while for the food to come to our table). I really enjoyed my meal - the breakwich (aka a breakfast sandwich on homemade donut). It was really tasty, but the portion size was pretty tiny. Although that's probably a good thing because I was eating a sandwich on a donut. 

The place itself is a decent size and the decor is simple and cute. I was expecting it to be more cramped, but tables are spaced nicely. They have a tiny patio out front, but it was quite warm enough to sit out there. 

All around it was a pleasant meal and I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"When I saw the menu I immediately decided this was going to be my favourite place in the whole world but the circumstances of almost all my experiences say otherwise. The first few times I tried to come it was 'between' hours so there was no food. This was pretty weird since it's not fine dining it's a basically a licks burger with a whole bunch of menu items that don't life up to their expectation. Since you could only get dessert during my peak hunger hours 3-5pm I became obsessed with a dessert that's a donut cut in half filled with ice cream and covered with whip cream and whatever topping you like (skor bits, gummy bears, chocolate chips etc). It's actually a fatty's dream but after twice getting stale donuts and once standing at the counter for more than 15 minutes waiting and finally walked out I decided I would retire the donut-sandwich because this was turning into borderline obsession. How does one stand at an ice-cream counter for that long? I was the only customer it's not like I was waiting in a line!!!

When I finally went here for a hangover lunch months later I spent $15 for spaghetti and meatballs and my meatballs came out frozen, I got mac and cheese to replace it but that was mediocre AT BEST. They brought me free donuts to compensate for having to wait but those were stale... The coffee was horrible and the service is consistently terrible. The worst is when the manager/owner is there and he stands there watching his staff fall to pieces. Why are you there if you're not going to help, it's your diner you should have a fleck of feeling as to how it's run. Once I went for breakfast with my mom and grandma. His iphone rang at full blast continuously because he had no voicemail and the person kept calling back. I kid you not at least 3 full minutes of horrible ringing until I had to ask the server to turn the wretched thing on silence.

Go for ice cream sandwiches but make sure the donuts aren't stale otherwise you could easily make this yourself with donuts from metro."}
{"text":"We love this place! Been here twice now and can't fault it.
I even took my family who was visiting from the U.K and they loved it too. 
My personal recommendation is the eggs Benedict, served on donuts instead of English muffins. It's really tasty and the combination works really well with each other. 
We have never had any issue with service and always found staff friendly and helpful. 
My only nag is the home fries. I would like to see hash brown on the menu as I prefer that to home fries, but that's just me. 
Overall a great place that looks quirky and colourful. An overall pleasant environment for a breakfast outing."}
