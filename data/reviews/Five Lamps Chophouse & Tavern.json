{"text":"The pasta we ordered tasted like it was taken directly from the pot of boiled water and thrown into the plate. Absolutely no taste, they think adding diced tomatoes and some spinach makes it a meal. The pizza is just ok, I've had better at home."}
{"text":"Reading the previous reviews I am left scratching my head.  I had rainbow trout with horseradish and bacon....as nice of a lunch as I have ever had.  Craft beers, great bar. Eat in the bar or upstairs in the dining room.  Service top notch.  Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best and the service isn't that great. A couple of my friends & I ordered chowder and they came back with veggie soup that looked like it came from a can. We told them there was a mistake and all the waitress said was, \"I'm not sure what happened\" and there was nothing she could do about it."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way.   Checks all of the boxes if you like a pub that features a talented kitchen.  A terrific array of local and imported micro brews on tap including a rare find: Scotland's Brewdog Punk IPA.  The menu is well thought out and carefully delivered.  I had a killer mahi mahi over kale with lentils and olive oil.  My colleague had a salmon done with horseradish and bacon.  Both really, really good.  Mo the bartender was very knowledgable on the subjects of beer and the menu.  Downstairs pub and upstairs dining room located on Unionville's quaint Main St.  Only drawback is the lighting... seemed dark.  Washrooms in the basement were a bit of a hike from the bar, and while exceptionally clean, were quite cold."}
{"text":"Nothing really worth mentioning about this place.   The pulled pork pizza was below average - at $15 you get a thin crust pizza with you typical tomato sauce and cheese with some pineapples and petite portion of pulled pork. The size of the pizza is similar to a dinner plate and the portion of actual pulled pork is similar to the size of a ping pong ball. (2 stars)  The burger of the month was a bit better. The bun used was the same texture as a bagel which I liked. There was some cheese and ham and the actual patty itself was very juicy and done perfectly medium rare just the way I like. For $1.50 you can upgrade the fries to sweet potato fires. No special dipping sauce, just your standard ketchup. (3 stars)  At the end we were up-sold to get dessert. Worst decision ever. Got the cherry cheese cake for $7.49 and the quality level is similar to what you can find in the frozen section of your local grocery store. (1 star)  Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"Five Lamps has 12 drafts on taps with a selection of imports and locals, which is not bad for Unionville.  Their House Draft Five Lamps Cream Ale ($4.75) is quite a steal in the area. Not amazing and quite drinkable. Brewed by Magnotta Brewery similar to True North.  I couldn't comment on the food as I was only here for a drink.  Bartender is super friendly. The atmosphere is quite casual at least downstairs in the tavern area.  Not a bad choice if you want a quick drink with your friends."}
