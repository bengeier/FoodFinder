{"text":"I am nothing if not fair so I here's my update on barrio fiesta, one of my most disappointing dining experiences of recent memory. We were driving along steeles and lo and behold a sign that said Barrio fiesta, now serving crispy pata. Did my eyes deceive me? a few blocks later, another sign. It had to be true.

We ended up having lunch here and my oh my how things how changed. They now served pork and had a whole menu page dedicated to it. Apparently some minor ownership changes brought about this pleasant transformation.

We ordered the crispy pata, sisig, squid and vegetables. The menu had some other cuisine on it which I find strange and unnecessary but at least everything looked appetizing. When we were done, while I was happy with the options, I found the food to be a bit mediocre. Nowhere near what the real barrio fiesta is. Sisig had strange texture to it, crispy pata wasn't that great, and the chinese style vegetables was plain ridiculous with the size of bokchoy they used. The baby squids werent babies at all but one giant squid though it was the most successful dish of them all.

I'd give it 4 stars for the effort but 2 for the food. I would see myself trying it out again because other stuff on the menu looked interesting."}
{"text":"I can't give zero stars, Food is average just like any other Filipino place, the SERVICE SUCKS!!!!! Do not i said do not come here as the service sucks! I ordered beef wonton amd the siumai was not there, i asked the server and she stirred my bowl and asked if it was not there, after a few minutes they brought 1 siu mai cut in half where the order should have had more, the server did not even apologized and was very lousy on the service, this is the last time i am coming here - for the price, the restaurant should provide better service."}
{"text":"The food here is OK. I found that the prices were not reasonable considering that the food was just fine. It is not fine dining but they insist on charging fine dining prices, it's silly and not worth the drive. I was really surprised that the restaurant was full."}
{"text":"A lot of people think the food and service are horrible but it's actually not that bad. The Filipino food are actually great. There are a lot of non-Filipino food on their menu but if you're gonna come here, you might as well try the Filipino food. So I would recommend the Palabok noodles and Pork Sisig. Previously they didn't have pork in their menu at all...which I found very odd because a lot of Filipino food consist of pork. But when I came here today, they finally have pork sisig. It was quite good, but I would definitely recommend adding mayo in that sisig for extra yumminess (that's how we make our pork sisig at home and trust me...the flavours are bolder). And I would really appreciate more Chicharon in the Palabok noodles for extra crunchiness next time. Last but not the least, I definitely recommend the halo halo for dessert for obvious reasons - it's the bomb.

It's true, Filipino food is quite expensive. It's very disappointing. I would definitely like to see more less than $10 food in their menu because a lot of these food are actually a bit overpriced. 

Overall it's ok. A lot better than Max in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was bad and expensive.Their sisig was so bad and the shrimp on the fried rice was spoiled.The tables were so dirty and service was mediocre.Take your business somewhere else.Definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"I visited Barrio Fiesta around noon on a Tuesday and it was empty. The service was prompt with no complaints. Ordered the crispy chicken sisig, crispy chicken skin, and bagoong rice - all of which was enough for 3 people for lunch so make sure you either come with a big appetite or with friends/family! Taste-wise, it was overall delicious. My favourites were the bagoong rice and crispy chicken sisig. The bagoong rice includes green mango, which I don't often eat so I really enjoyed that! If you're in the area and a fan of Philippine cuisine, this place is worth a try.

I enjoy these items much more than what Max's offers across the street."}
{"text":"very average food and slow service. 
My wife and I had lunch here and didn't like it at all. 
Not reccomend to come here."}
{"text":"2 star for 1 reason.. poor customer service! i phoned in earlier around 8:30 to placed pick up order and who ever answered the phone said that they're already closed when they suppose to be open till 9 and she even told me that their chef Does not want to cook anymore."}
{"text":"We work in the area so we decided to venture out of our usual preferences and try something new... Should have just stuck with our usual go-to. I ordered the Laksa noodles which which was $10.94 and my husband the sweet and sour pork with veggies and a pepsi which was $13.95. We ordered this stuff to go and I was completely shocked that everything we ordered fit in 3 little containers. My Laksa was in a small white foam container with the soup, noodle and toppings crammed in (which you can probably imagine the portion was extremely small) how in the world do you cram noodles with soup with toppings in a SMALL FOAM container?????? And my husbands sweet and sour pork? He 2 extra small containers one which consisted of 4 small pieces of pork and another soupy container of overly salty stir fried veggies.  For $23 this is pricey, and on top of that the portions were ridiculously small they may as well be robbing people for their money. I'm guessing the portions would be a little bigger if you were to eat there.. b/c i cannot imagine an extra small bowl of Laksa being served in the resto for $10.94. None the less, the food was crap, extremely over priced and on top of that we spent 20 mins sitting there waiting for the food to be ready. 

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, expensive price. Paid over $10 for special fried rice packed in small soup container. Service slow. Waited 15 min for take out during past lunch hours. Waitress didn't bother to give my $0.10 change.  That isn't the tip if u asked me, unless it was mutual!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since we were in the area. We went there on a weekend dinner and we were surprised that there were no lineups. We ordered Kare-kare and Litson kawali. The service was prompt and the food was delicious. Comparing to Maxx nearby, I like Barrio Fiesta better."}
{"text":"Wow! I didn't know there would be a Filipino restaurant this good in Toronto! Came here for Tuesday lunch and ordered the lechon kawali and crispy chicken sisig. The food was just right and serving size was more than average. The service was quick because we were the only ones. I'd prefer this restaurant than Max's across the street. It has better price, service, food, and place!"}
{"text":"I dont get ALL the hate. As a person who just moved from the Philippines, I really appreciate their Sizzling Pork Sisig (LEGIT. IT IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK/TASTE/BE THAT WAY). I also had the sizzling bangus (alright), and sotanghon (bad, not worth it at all). 

One down side is that when my mom and I were there, there was only one lady so she was really busy so we couldnt really blame how we had to wait quite some time for her just to get our orders or the long wait for the food/service, in general. Quite expensive, too."}
