{"text":"I got a plastic spoon on my waffle yesterday, and the manager did nothing at all about, just acting like it didn't happen,  I even had to pay full price. Never come back again!  The start is for the place, which looks so beautiful."}
{"text":"I decided to go here as I've passed by it before, and I took a chance without expecting much difference between dip 'n dip and caffe demetre.   I have to say that the cafe layout, furniture, and ambiance was as good or better than demetre. The main attraction was definitely the four large chocolate fondue fountains they have on display. A WOW moment for foodies like me.   We ordered the chocolate fondant, with vanilla ice cream and I must say I was thoroughly impressed with the taste. A 10/10 on the item. As for the coffee, take a pass on getting any flavoured coffees and get regular coffees. Not worth the extra money for a couple pumps of syrup.   The huge problem (and the reason for a 2 star)  was the horrible wait staff and attention to detail, due to understaffing on both the front and back end of the cafe. Wait staff didn't show up to take our order, drinks and food I didn't order started coming out, which were intended for other tables, and customers around us were very unhappy.   The table next to me was starting that Demetre would have been a better choice, and I would have agreed.   This is a new franchise in Canada, and it clearly needs proper training, and systems that take orders properly. The staff was stuck with a bunch of papers, and could not confirm the orders with customers, and it was very unprofessional.   I asked what happened, and said that they were under staffed, and the people in the kitchen were 17 year olds that were not trained.   If you are the franchise owner, I would highly recommend that the process of ordering and staff training be delivered immediately before it gets worse,  and customers take notice.  The only time I would go if I returned would only be during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Chocolate and coffee very well prepared. I had this trio of desserts. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to have free count of calorie tell midnight in Toronto, hope to see more places on Ontario"}
{"text":"It's a nice place for dessert in the area, if you're not feeling for ice cream or yogurt. They serve everything chocolate, you can get crepes, waffles, drinks, fondue etc.   It can get a little busy inside, but lots of seating. There's something about the decor wasn't as inviting to sit for long periods of times. There was a lot going on, but they have nice arm chairs and tables.   I found the price a steep for a crepe. $12.99 and up for a crepe or waffle. It was good though. We got the brownie crepe - filled with chocolatey baked goodness, and topped off with the sauce of your choice (or all )  - milk, bitter and white. It tasted awesome, but we finished it too quickly.   The service was okay, although I felt like the server was judging us on whatever we ordered and seemed a little off.   I'd come back again when I crave chocolate."}
{"text":"Great chocolate based desserts with very friendly service in a nice location with plenty of seating conducive to conversation and meeting with friends!"}
{"text":"The food here is SPECTACULAR. I've never had so much chocolate in my lifeeeeee! The service was somewhat subpar but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Very expensive coffee house with a cool location. Right on the corner of Bloor West & Jane St. I had a $5.00 cappuccino with little tiny finger desserts. Don't know what their called. This would be a great \"date Ender\" location!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Its a great place for desert. their chocolate is comparable to none. Exquisite taste. I was baffled by their chocolate fountain display which made my chocolate experience even better. I definetly recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"The best chocolate fondue I have ever had!!!! I came here with 2 of my friends, and it was the best dessert place I have ever tried.  We had the fondue platter with strawberries, bananas, and white chocolate to dip. We also had the s'mores platter with marshmallows. It was amazing. There is so much more I want to try here so I will definitely be back. Service was also great! The waiters and waitresses were so nice!"}
