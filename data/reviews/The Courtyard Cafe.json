{"text":"I have only been here twice and I love it. The atmosphere just has a real home feel to it. I have received great service both times and its very clean an the food was great ! I ordered potato skins and they were well worth the money. I always have some to take home. I have already recommended this place to several people."}
{"text":"The most consistent place I've ever been to as far as normal traditional american fare. I love sitting at bar wi my wife. Great bartender. Lunch specials and soups are always good. Fresh homemade bread is a must there. Owner is there and smiling a lot. My father took me when I was a kid. Never fails. Pizza very good as well."}
{"text":"Since 1989 I've probably eaten at the Courtyard about 100 times. This past Friday was the last. My mother-in-law was in town and we decided to go to the Courtyard for dinner. She ordered the lasagna and was mortified to find a wadded-up piece of plastic wrap in the lasagna. It was wadded up into about the size of a small french fry and soaked in red sauce. She chewed it before pulling it out and unwrapping to discover what it was. This turned a nice evening into a sickening experience. The waitress idiotically acted as if we had made up the story. The manager comp'd my mother-in-law's entreé but never even came over to apologize. That specific manager (big guy with glasses] has seen me there dozens of times. To assume that I was making this up is ludicrous and insulting. I'm usually very tolerant of little mistakes at restaurants. This one and the restaurant staff's response to it  was unforgivable. I would discourage anyone from ever going to this place."}
{"text":"A lunch place for the blue bloods and blue hairs of Phoenix. But good. And pricey.  Seriously, this is a great lunch spot, whether you are visiting the Heard or not. They have a great outdoor dining area and service is attentive. Yes, prices are high, but they have a captive museum audience and can get away with it. And yes, everybody there this particular Sunday was at least 20 years older than me.  Their menu is not very extensive, but it is eclectic and original. I had an awesome veggie wrap (hummus, roasted bell peppers, pickles, spinach, feta, grilled onion, and nuts) and a side quinoa salad. My partner had a hearty turkey sandwich which he claimed had too much meat on it. Both of us had a great salad topped with jicama and raspberry dressing.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place. French onion soup is amazing!  Service is amazing!  Every time we visit the staff is always friendly and courteous. One of my favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"I had the berry salad with candied pecans, brie, and prickly pear dressing. My husband had stuffed peppers and frybread and turned it into a taco by sticking the peppers into the frybread and folding it in half. The food was amazing. We both had iced tea, which had a fruity flavor to it. I think I would try the prickly pear lemonade next time. My husband says that the frybread and stuffed peppers were very good. My salad was excellent. Prices were museum prices, a little more than what you would pay somewhere else, but the flavor is so fabulous, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Hot! Tuna melt so good! Danielle W was a great server and took very good care of our group. I would definitely go there again when I'm in this area."}
{"text":"For over 20 years this has been our \"go to\" restaurant.  From the chicken salad to the ribs you will not go wrong. Clean, great food, great service, casual, moderately priced and a fair sized portion, this restaurant will soon find you 20 years later to be your \"go to\" place. Our family has grown with the Courtyard family from birthdays to just a night out. Many of the same service team is still there since we started going.  I would like to say thanks to the staff and ownership of Courtyard for the many years of great service.  5 stars for our Michael and his fantastic team at the Brecksville Courtyard."}
{"text":"food was tasty & very fresh, although over priced, and the service was great.  Nice to eat on the patio as well."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good here and they run specials I believe if buy one get one free on Tuesdays.  Love all of their pizzas.  Other food is average which I am sorry to say.  I know it's average because I can make better food.  I am not sure they have a real chef or someone who just grew up in a kitchen and likes to cook.  My wife and mother in law are ten times the cooks these guys are.  (Except for the za).   For breakfast.  Food is pretty good but Yiu really cannot mess that up.  Coffee is horrible and isalways weak on top of that.  How much do they really save by serving weak coffee. If You out cream in the coffee Yiu are basically drinking cream out of their croaky mugs that feel dirty all the time."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Courtyard. Their  soups and salads are great and I really think their burgers and fries are really good. Try it!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and experience here at this small, but delightful restaurant that is part of the Heard Museum complex (we visited the Heard Museum for Kahlo/Rivera and also Rick Bartow --his work, previously unknown to me, was exquisite).   We had Chile Lime Shrimp Ceviche (wow!), Tepary Bean Hummus (good, but not as amazing as the ceviche), posole (requested extra fresh items to mix into the soup, and was nicely obliged), heirloom BLT sandwich, turkey and melted brie sandwich, and to finish: a really tasty chocolate cookie ala mode... Prickly pear margarita, also tasty.   I would absolutely return here as the food was so good. Service was quick and seamless. Location was excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here for years and to date have never had a bad meal.  The salads are enormous and filling the steaks are large and cooked to perfection. If you are just in the mood for a cocktail or two you will not be disappointed by \"short or light pouring\" fHighly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the Courtyard Cafe. It was even better than I anticipated from the other reviews. My wife and I ordered more than we should have though, because the portions are very generous. For soups, we tried the French Onion and also the New England Clam Chowder. The salads we chose were the Texas Tumbleweed and the Spinach Strawberry. The main courses were Grouper and Ribs. Chocolate cake with vanilla bean for dessert. Everything was wonderful and we took home more than we ate. Five stars."}
{"text":"Went to this place twice this far and the food has been good. I had the chicken pesto and my fiance loves the frech onion soup. The last time we went the bartenders seemed to be more in tune to cleaning the whole bar a little more then service, but it was still good"}
{"text":"Been coming to the Courtyard for over 20 years and always leave saying the same thing' \"how do they keep the quality so consistent?\"    The food is great and both the staff and customers are always friendly!   Couldn't imagine Brecksville without the Courtyard!  If you haven't been there, you owe it to yourself to visit; you will be a fan, too."}
{"text":"Our uncle took us to this place the last time we visited them in Cleveland.  The place isn't fancy, it doesn't really have a family feel to it either, it kind of reminds me of a Bar/Grill.  But the atmosphere was comfortable.  We were told everything was good, our family didn't lie and the food didn't disappoint.  I remember the french onion... mmm... onion... =)"}
{"text":"Very generous portions.  Had a quesadilla for lunch and it was very good.  While they give refills for the ice tea, they only give a can when one orders a soda.  If were to order a drink, I would probably order the ice tea, which I have heard from the members I was with, was good."}
{"text":"Courtyard is an excellent restaurant ! Great staff, food, and GOOD SERVICE. We was seated immediately and our food came out fast and hot.   The restaurant is huge but judging from the outside you couldn't even tell. Courtyard does offer free wifi once you get the password from a server as well as entertainment with TV's around their huge bar area.   Another great feature in this cafe is their wall of Cleveland's history, I mean I don't know too much about Cleveland being as though I moved here from Washington DC but it's evident that Courtyard Cafe is passionate about the city of Cleveland from Sports, Rock and Roll, and it's development over time.  Last, I have to mention that Courtyard Cafe isn't pricey at all for the price that you pay, you'll get a huge entree, appetizer, and even dessert as well. I give Courtyard 2 THUMBS up and recommend everyone to try it out."}
{"text":"As a general rule, I like Courtyard. Great salads, reasonable prices, nice outdoor patio in the summer. Soups and muffins and french bread are always very good too. But here's my complaint.......it is their BIZARRE policy about chicken strips. The other night I stopped in for a drink and a snack. I was hungry for chicken strips, and asked if they had them. The answer was yes, but they don't sell them to adults. Really?????? I understand having a small kid sized portion with a kid sized price, but why not have an appetizer sized portion for adults? They flat out refused to sell them to me for any price. Just weird!!!!!!! I don't blame the server, he was just doing his job, but the manager refused too. No flexibility."}
{"text":"The food here was really good with fresh / interesting ingredients. Service was only ok. Pricing was fine (mid range)."}
{"text":"I discovered the Courtyard Cafe while googling other top shelf burger joints so stopped in last Saturday evening with six friends to see what all the fuss was about. Turns out, the fuss is justified.  We were seated in not the best of locations -next to the waitstaff stand and the host desk. Seated at a couple of four-square tables, the noise was at the limit of acceptable. The constant movement of staff and customers past our tables was also a bit distracting. But, what the heck, somebody's got to sit there, Right? Either that or wait for a better location to open up. Who knows how long that would take as they are pretty busy. But if you can sit outside in the courtyard to enjoy the music (cool jazz playing the night I was there), go for it.  Anyway, I ordered the Courtyard Burger. Their basic burger is described as a generous portion of fresh USDA Choice Angus Beef on a toasted Kaiser roll, served with lettuce, tomato and a kosher pickle slice. The Courtyard Burger adds melted Swiss cheese, grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms, with sour cream, for $8.99. A side of hand cut French fries were added for another $1.99, which in my estimate is an automatic.  The fries were crisp and ample, the perfect compliment for what would be the nearly perfect burger. While I didn't get to try the sour cream on the burger (someone at the table grabbed it thinking it was theirs), I don't think it really needed anything else. It came just as I ordered it, had a great flame-cooked taste, and the cheese was melted all over the top and sides of the burger. Now usually when onions or mushrooms are added to a burger you get just enough to justify calling them a \"topping.\" The Courtyard was so liberal that when I picked up the burger for that first bite the cheese just slowly oozed down onto the plate, carrying with it an abundance of onions and mushrooms, which would later be eaten with a fork. But yet there was still enough to enjoy in every delicious mouthful.  The bun was also huge. But even toasted it couldn't last through the entire meal without turning into a soggy handful for that final bite, that's how generous the extras were. And that is not a complaint! So, go for the jazz in the courtyard, stay for the burgers."}
{"text":"Arguably the best burgers in the Cleveland area. Soups and salads are also excellent. Highly  recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch (served buffet style) on Sunday on a Groupon. It has a really nice ambiance and there was live jazz so it's definitely a good place to have brunch. The food is pretty good for the most part - I absolutely loved the dessert selection. If you want eggs benedict, you have to order it from the server. I don't really like this because there is no indication of this, I had to ask someone because I saw a couple of other people who had it. Who knows what else might have been included that was only served if you asked for it. Service was OK, we had to flag down our server if we needed anything.  The main downside is the price. Even on the Groupon, it was $37, full price is around $50 I believe. I think you can have way better/comparable brunch for a fraction of that price. I'd expect more options, better service and overall higher quality food to justify paying $50."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  It is nothing fancy or flashy, but all the food is great.  The menu is pretty standard: hamburgers, salads, pasta, pizza sandwiches and it is all excellent.  They have different lunch and dinner specials every night.  My favorites are the Oriental Salad and the French Dip.  The best part by far of the whole place are the muffins of the day.  They have some of the best muffins I have ever tried and they are huge.  If you are looking for something easy, casual and tasty this is a great place.  You will not be disappointed I have been going here for something like 10 years and I have never have."}
{"text":"Ah-maxing grouper!  Everything I've tasted on their menu is good. They have an extensive menu for all tastes."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers for family meals for about 8 years. It has generally been good experience- good food, reasonable service, great neighborhood atmosphere. However, over the last year or so the service got markedly worse - the waiters are slower and not very attentive. But what is worse, the place is just dirty - to the extent that after the last visit we decided we would stop further visits until the management decides to do a cleaning freshen up."}
{"text":"Repeating my review from before... this place originally was run by the Arcadia Farms folks, and the Heard Museum has now taken over the operations directly.    Fortunately they have not screwed it up!   Everything is really YUM - all fresh ingredients.   And the setting couldn't be more beautiful.   I often grab lunch here even when I'm not going to the Museum, it's just such a beautiful, quiet setting, particularly if it is nice enough to sit outside.  I've often brought out-of-town guests to this spot and they are ALWAYS impressed.  It's one of my top-5 lunch spots when the weather is nice and you want to sit outside.  (Hmm, I gotta create a list about this!)    There are far too few outdoor dining experiences in Phoenix like this - because the sitting is in the middle of a courtyard, you don't have the annoyance of car noise or smells nearby.   It's an oasis!   You'll love it and your guests will too."}
{"text":"The café is situated alongside the entry courtyard to the Heard Museum, adjacent to the bookstore and the museum store across the plaza.  I like this because you can dine before entering the museum, or get refreshments after your visit.  They have outdoor and indoor dining.  The winds were stuff on the day we visited, so we ate indoors.  The hostess and wait staff were very attentive and friendly.  I enjoyed the posolé, a pork stew with garbanzo beans.  My Mom and sister shared the tasty Dreamcatcher salad.  Our meal was followed by coffees.  Parking is free, and the courtyard restaurant is in a relaxed setting away from the busy streets."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the loveliest places to eat in Phoenix. Indoors or out in the courtyard, the ambiance is top notch. The food is quite pricey so I was very disappointed to see how much they scrimped on my salad. It was supposed to be kale and greens. There were just a few kale leaves. I counted four pomegranate seeds and a tiny smattering of walnuts. For the most expensive salad on the menu, it broke my heart. Even my husband's sandwich, one that he used to get at the Heard North restaurant, was not up to par. There was actually a large piece of apple core that he had to spit out because it was not edible. Lastly, we lingered over a coffee and a cookie on the patio after taking in much that the museum has to offer. The oatmeal raisin cookie was awful, simply awful, stale and tasteless. The café does not even have a real cappuccino machine. This is a ridiculous oversight given the high price of meals and the expensive admission fee. Overall, for first time visitors, it was a hugely disappointing eating experience."}
{"text":"Went back for my second visit last week.  This time was dinner around 8pm on a weeknight with one of my girlfriends.  There was no wait, but the place was pretty full, which is kind of surprising since it's tucked away in a stip mall in a suburb.  The crowd was mostly older folks, which was also a little surprising considering the time of day.  We both got salads, which were again fresh and large.  I especially liked the red French dressing, which tasted homemade.  My friend had to customize her salad, which the waitress had no problem doing.   I got the meatloaf sandwich to take home for my husband, which he said was tasty.  He said the bread was especially good.  I will agree with Steve W. that this is not ever going to be an adventurous foodie's favorite place.  While I generally am a very adventurous eater, the majority of my relatives are all very picky eaters, so it's pretty impossible for us to go to a restaurant that I am excited about and they are not afraid of.  I am happy that places like the Courtyard Cafe exist because my relatives know they can find things here within their comfort zone, and I don't have to endure the agony of eating at a national chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Consistent good food for years. My family and I love this place. The French onion soup is the best you'll get around Ohio. I love the ribs and the salads are huge and good. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very classic and it had an old school \"comfy\" feel to it. I had the Courtyard burger and it did not disappoint. The mushrooms and cheese were flowing and there was a gracious bun with juicy toppings. I prefer medium-rare and it was cook pretty accurate. I would recommend this place and would come here again! Great work."}
{"text":"Great place. Fantasic 'old world' bar and decor. The food was amazing. The service was great. Don't hesitate to visit this great restaurant."}
{"text":"The Courtyard Cafe has been a fixture in Brecksville for the past three decades. We've been coming here for years and haven't had a bad meal. It's located at the southeast corner of Route 82 (Chippewa Road) and 21 (Brecksville Road) in what's now the Marc's plaza.   With the Courtyard you get a mix of Brecksville history (similar to old New England), a sports bar, and a fine dining restaurant. The space seems a bit cramped and darkly lit inside, but it's cozy. There's also a patio for the spring and summer months.  The French Onion soup as always been a favorite of ours, and they do it up well: baked in a bowl with croutons, and topped with provolone cheese. Highly recommended as a starter or, if you're not too hungry, a meal.  If you're a fan of fish, they do a really good job -- especially with the grouper wrap.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"While hanging out in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, I Yelped some places for dinner and head over to Brecksville on the edge of the park for dinner. It was a Friday night and the place was crowded. They said the wait would be 30 minutes, but i only took 12. We explored the local stores while we waited. We got a table outside and I'm glad we did, it seemed very noisy inside. Dinner was great, will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so of course it's awesome!  They have a very tasty tuna melt and the club is great.  I enjoy their fries with the house seasoning (cajun?) at the table.  I was a little turned off by the croissant when ordering but it works.  Some of the tables are rather cozy but that's great if you're with someone you love and the memorabilia on the walls is fun to look at.  Our service was great both times as well.  The courtyard looks like it would be cute when its warm and it was fun to sit and watch the snow fall in the winter."}
{"text":"This is a review for take out only. One word RUDE. Call to place a to go order and they ask what I want...I ask what kind of soup they have and the guy rudely says \"hold on\" then he doesn't come back for almost 5 whole minutes! Frustrating. I was just about to hang up and call Simons but he came back right then. Such poor customer service but I guess when you're one of the only games in town you don't care much. Love their food and bar but this was just annoying"}
{"text":"The place must be bustling, because I called around noon to order a gift card.  The guy said how do you want to get it.  I said you can mail it.  He then said they were too busy to help me to call back at 2.  I called back at 2 and was told they only do tokens, not gift cards.  No worries send me $50 in tokens.  They put me on hold, hung up on me.  I called back and they said they were too busy to write down my credit card number.  Seriously, there are 16 numbers on my cc and you can't write it down.  OK you obviously need a class in phone ettiquete.  No problem, got one somewhere else.  Hope their service in person is better than on the phone."}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing exceptional.  Very average, Americanized food. Mer."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Very tastefully decorated, I felt like I was in a different country! And the menu is small but everything is so thoughtfully put together. The fry bread with ya part bean hummus was delicious, as was my pasole and my husbands quesadilla. Loved the prickly pear lemonade. Prices were totally worth the quality and quantity!"}
{"text":"The Courtyard is the perfect neighborhood restaurant. The food is consistently good, the staff is always friendly. The bar is limited, but the pours are generous.  I'm currently obsessed with the Oriental Salad. You have a choice of adding grilled chicken or tenderloin. I always get the tenderloin - love the marinade on it. I recommend the poppyseed dressing, which is their suggestion as well.  For those days when you need some comfort carbs, meals come with choice of muffin of the day, French bread, or garlic bread. All amazing. I usually take the muffin to go and give it a family member, but every once in awhile I indulge in the French bread. That is a bread love moment! LOL.  On my most recent visit, I tried the Soup of the Day Mushroom Barley. So delish! If you're a French Onion Soup fan, they have that every day and it is everything."}
{"text":"The chile lime shrimp cerveche was amazing and the pulled pork stew dish (posole) was excellent. I loved the Spanish market chopped salad. Even the coffee and prickly pear lemonade was great. Nice experience. And the fry bread sundae was so so yummy."}
{"text":"A great restaurant with a great diverse menu. Their soups are awesome, have been going there for many years. Need to get back there. It's been so cold that we haven't done our share of eating out. Miss the waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy restaurant. The booths are tight and there is not much arm and leg room. We went for dinner on a Saturday around 6 and they were busy. We waited about 10 minutes for a booth. My son ordered a wrap and Cajun fries which he liked. I ordered the chicken Parmesan which was grilled chicken breast on capellini. The red sauce was delicious; however, the chicken was covered with a slice of unmelted cheese and an uncooked tomato slice which was a little unappealing. The French bread is a round loaf and was delicious. I highly recommend it as your choice of bread. My husband ordered the smothered chicken with rice pilaf and vegetables and thought it was pretty good. Service was good, alcohol prices are very reasonable, and they give a generous pour on the wine."}
{"text":"I've been a Brecksville resident for 14 yrs and have never fallen in love with this place. I've tried many times and just find the place dirty and the food disgusting. I have never had a good meal here. I really don't understand why so many people think this place is great. It must just be the cute outside courtyard??? I met some friends for lunch today (they picked the place not me!) and the fruit in my salad and my friend's salad was rotten. I can't believe that the kitchen staff would think of serving rotten food. Really??? Wow. Our waitress was very polite and took it back to the kitchen, only to return and tell us that's all they had. Yuck! I picked around at my salad and couldn't wait to leave the place. I said to my friends in the parking lot \"Let's never go to this place again\". Needless to say they agreed. I just hope none of us get sick from the food we ate."}
{"text":"Family of four just spent Christmas dinner at the $75/person buffet. We failed to be seated for 25 minutes after our reservation time and had some of the worst service from wait staff we've ever experienced. Surly and inattentive is putting it kindly. Food quality was adequate for a buffet but we will skip this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Good solid place, never had anything that wasn't prepared well... plus you can get a fish dinner (lunch sized portion) for under $10.00 and its fresh and yummy!  Not a bad deal..."}
{"text":"With a glass of Santa Rita wine ($5.50) and their French Dip sandwich at $8.49 (roast beef & melted provolone cheese, served with au jus on a sub roll), it was a perfect lunch combo. I've frequented this place several times over the years and it still remains a favorite in Brecksville. I love how they present a gift card when it's ordered...complete in a box with a bow!"}
{"text":"We like this cafe. It is certainly not the best lunch in Phoenix but where it is it is close to perfect. Service was great and that is what I think of first. The waitress was friendly and gave good advice and apologized when the food and drinks were delayed. The kitchen was slow though not as slow as some places. I had a prickly pear margarita which was tasty.  With my main course I had a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc which worked with Georgia O'Keeffe green chile enchiladas. Unfortunately the tasty enchiladas were a challenge to my digestive system. My wife loved the pesole and a quesadilla with chicken added.  It was a great day to dine outside."}
{"text":"Great place to eat after or before visiting the museum. Friendly waiter Logen, he is professional.  We just had a mixed berry salad, we had to share it's large! It was so delicious! My son had a vanilla ice cream,  he said it was the best ice cream ever."}
{"text":"Being new to the Brecksville area, I decided to try this place out for lunch.  I chose to pick up my order so I can't comment on the service aspect other than that I was greeted and helped expediently.  I'm only giving this place three stars because I ordered a tuna melt expecting it to be a warm meal considering the description indicates \"melted sharp cheddar\" and \"warm croissant.\"  However, the tuna salad felt like it came directly out of a refrigerator, the croissant was not warm at all, and the cheese was barely melted...The sandwich was tasty, just not what I wanted on this cold day.  I'll definitely give this place another shot considering its great reputation but it missed the mark this first visit."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant in Brecksville. Always awesome! Food is consistently good. They always score perfect on their sanitation inspections so that's a really great tangential benefit!"}
{"text":"A little noisy for the price but I had the strip steak and it was simply amazing.  16 dollars for my girls margarita seemed a little high though."}
{"text":"We ate inside this small cafe. There is a large patio that has shade and sun tables. This was a great lunch spot while taking a break between a guided tour and our own tour. We had a bowl of Posole(pork,onion,tomatoes,hominy,pinto beans,cheese) and a pulled pork bbq torta sandwich that came with a choice of a side salad or corn chips. Not sure if there was a choice on the dressing, but it came with a lite vinagrete kind. The ice tea has free refills, but the diet coke came in a can, so no complimentary refills on that. We wanted to try dessert, but we were too full and they closed at 3pm,so that was not doable on this trip. service was a little slow the day we were there, but food was great."}
{"text":"I've not been to this side of Cleveland.  Love the fries!!!!!  Best old school  restaurant.  This place is hammered busy so that's a sign that ALL THE FOOD IS GOOD!"}
{"text":"Very pricey and lunch took a whole hour (I was late getting back to work and I work across the street).   The food was good and the service was pleasant, but still don't see how a quesadilla 1) costs $15 and 2) takes 40 minutes to cook."}
{"text":"Had an excellent vegetarian salad. It was had avocado, pepitos, tomatoes, and other tasties. It was called Dreamcatcher Salad. Now I'm off to view the exhibits at the Heard Museum."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant. Reliable, delicious, satisfying.   I've been on a take out kick, so tonight's order was two orders of French onion soup, twice baked potato, and French bread roll (this really sets the bar for rolls, it's more like a loaf).    The French onion soup is flavorful, more broth than meat and onions (before the meat and cheese dressing), but carries enough taste that you don't look for the bits of beef. I always order the cheese and croutons on the side (some places ruin their soup this way.. to me:), and had no issues with specific requests.   The twice baked potato isn't the same as your own home made, but it suffices without all the work! Good sized potatoes, cheesy whipped filling, enough to eat as a light meal.   If your meal doesn't come with a bread side, order it!  They're fresh muffins are different every day and the French rolls put others to shame.   4 stars for inconsistent service, sitting on the patio sometimes feels like you were forgotten. Outside seating needs to be improved"}
{"text":"Lunch service was fairly quick for a full-service restaurant (no more than 10 minutes wait).  The food tasted fine but was not outstanding.  Ingredients were just average.  Prices seemed about 50% high for what was provided.  The venue and decor were adequate but not inspiring."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite. I drive 20 minutes just to come here( I know it's not a lot ). I love the French onion soup. My son gets there chicken and fries and I also love them too and he just loves that it comes on a frisbee and he gets to take it home with him. Even when we get takeout the food is just as delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"For nearly three decades Brecksville has been blessed with this special eatery. No matter what we're in the mood for, who we're with, or what the occasion, we head to The Courtyard! Comfortable, fun, pub-like atmosphere, but it's the consistency that brings us back, time and time again. From burgers/sandwiches, steaks/ribs, large selection of seafood, homemade soups, and the best pizza around, you can be sure it's prepared perfectly, delicious, and served with a smile. Great food, attentive, friendly staff ... can't say enough good about our favorite eatery. Great seasonal patio dining, too. Our \"Cheers\" ... always a favorite!!"}
{"text":"Still, one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been going to the Courtyard for the past 20-25 yrs. Having lived close by, I used to visit the courtyard at least a couple times a month. The service and food are just as great now as it was 20 yrs ago. Nothing has changed except maybe an update on the restrooms. The decor is charming with a bunch of Cleveland related chachkas and photos.  Although I've tried a lot of different things on the menu, I always go back to my same few favorite items. I'm very picky about Cesar salad and french onion soup and theirs is the best. All dressings are homemade. Their Cesar dressing has just the right detectable hint of anchovy. They actually sell their dressings by the pint or quart. I stop in whenever I am in the area and pick up some Cesar and creamy peppercorn (my fav) dressing. The only place I have had a better Cesar salad is Vegas. The french onion soup is perfect as well with a nice thick slab of melted slightly crusty provolone on top.   The appetizers are great and they arrive on your table in about 5 minutes...seriously. Some of the best ones are the mozzarella sticks and the potato skins (OK, so the skins take a little longer than 5 mins). For the skins, I always get the mushroom and provolone. The ratio of potato to toppings is perfect. I don't like when there's too much potato. They really load the toppings on.  As far as main courses, I used to get the chicken salad on a croissant almost every time I was there, but I have since OD'd on it and I have moved on to other things ;) I highly recommend it though. It's got huge chunks of tender chicken with almond slivers and grapes. Lately, I have been opting for the \"old french dip\" sandwich which is roast beef on a croissant with creamy peppercorn dressing to dip in. It's not on the menu anymore in this form. It's more like a traditional french dip now. But if you ask for the \"old french dip\", they will know what you are talking about.  They have good dinner type entrees like steaks and fish as well, although I don't get them often. I am too fixated on the items I mentioned above. Their twice-baked potatoes are great.  The Courtyard is a really good, consistent, basic American restaurant. I hope they never change."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while visiting the Heard Museum. It's a bit pricey (what museum eatery isn't?), but the apps we had were very good, and the entrees being delivered to other diners looked delicious and attractive. We opted for the chips and guacamole and the shrimp ceviche. Lots of chips and healthy portion of guac. Ceviche was flavorful and had plenty of tiny shrimp. The service was adequate, although we would've appreciated water refills (we had to ask a couple of times.)   The café is small, but bright and welcoming. There are tables available on the outdoor court patio. The water feature in the courtyard creates a serene setting. The café is located outside of the museum entrance doors, and is a great place for lunch at times other than a museum visit.   The Heard Museum is one of Phoenix's treasures and this little café is also a gem. Only am giving three stars because we only had appetizers - we'll be back and order some \"real food.\")"}
{"text":"Tonight, my grandparents treated me to dinner at the Courtyard Cafe. It was my first time there.  We sat on the patio and at first glance, it appeared spacious and clean. However, after about 5 minutes, I realized that I was going to spend the majority of my evening swatting bugs out of my face and my food. _______ I attempted to order pizza but was shot down by the waitress, who told me that it would take approximately 40 minutes to prepare it.  While selecting a less labor-intensive entree from the menu, I found myself distracted by the loud, jazz music blasting in the background. I couldn't think straight--which is shocking, given that I am in my twenty's and have a pretty high tolerance for noise.   I ended up ordering pasta with garlic and olive oil because it seemed like a safe option. But, when the food arrived, I found several small bugs in my pasta. I, then, brought it to the attention of the waitress, who promptly removed my dish from the table. She did not return to see if I wanted anything else nor did she offer to remake it for me.   Instead, a sloppy-looking manager showed up at our table to tell me that I was wrong about there being bugs in my pasta. He said that \"bugs\" were actually cooked garlic. Unless garlic moves, I am 200% sure that the \"bugs\" were, in fact, bugs.    After that, he walked away. At NO point did he apologize, offer to remake the dish or ask if I wanted to see the menu/try something else. Isn't the customer always right, especially when they are right?  Throughout dinner, I nibbled on the garlic bread-which was average. It looked and tasted like microwaved french bread with shredded cheese.  Based on this experience, I have NO interest in returning to Courtyard Cafe.  Below average food. Terrible service. Disgusting bug problem. Loud music. Confused wait staff.  I am truly shocked this place has received such good reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! I have been going here since I moved to Brecksville when I was 4 and still love it. I've never had a bad experience. The staff is friendly and the food is consistently great. The price is very reasonable and hasn't changed even with the economy."}
{"text":"Pricey but good. Indoor and outdoor seating. Tempery bean hummus is amazing but the fried bread is more like pizza crust. The tacos are super for lunch. Gelato for dessert is a nice treat."}
{"text":"Hot and tired after walking around the museum. Stopped in for a drink and a snack. We decided on the Caramel Apple Quesadilla. Are you kidding me!! So good! Service was polite even they were closing soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I like to drive up from Akron to shop at the Marc's next door. We decided to stop in here for some Pre-shopping lunch. We were very pleased with our choices, strawberry spinach salad with salmon for her and a BLT for me. We will definitely be back. Also our server Annie was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome time with the crew of 213EIS. The food, drinks and atmosphere were great. Waited about 40 minutes for a table, but the wait was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know this place is full of old people eating dinner...But, they do have a nice bar, nice outdoor seating and great selection of Fish dishes, all at reasonable prices.  No it's not gonna please the perpetually complaining modern day snobs who want everything to be like it is on Top Chef, but you will get a good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Had to get a snack wile at the museum. Food was ok but dessert was sooooo good fried bread sunday."}
{"text":"I went to the Courtyard Cafe for the first time for a late lunch and it was very enjoyable. The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere and the staff is friendly and attentive. The menu is extensive offering homemade soups, salads, full entrees (fish, beef, chicken, ribs), sandwiches, burgers, pizza, etc. They have a full bar and it looks like a nice dessert selection.  The mini-strip plaza that the restaurant is located in is undergoing renovation (Sep. 2011) so at the moment, the regular restaurant sign is not present but this should be corrected once the construction work is done.  Even with the construction and the odd late-lunch time, the place was about 1/3 full - I suspect they get packed during normal peak rushes.   I opted for the Smoked Turkey Bacon Monterrey Jack Wrap which was really really good. The wrap is sun-dried tomato flavored and went well with the smoked turkey and bacon. I particularly enjoyed the preparation at the Courtyard as they put the wrap into their pizza oven and toasted it, giving the outer wrap firmness, and marrying the ingredients via the melted cheese. Very tasty, and something I would order again. It came with a small cup of sour cream, but I did not use it as the sandwich was tasty enough without it. Additionally, I had a small cup of their homemade Italian wedding soup (Thursday special). It was also very good, with a lot of mini-meatballs. Each day, they make a different homemade soup. During pleasant weather, they also have a nice outdoor dining area.  So yes, I recommend the Courtyard Cafe. In case you want to go now while the construction is going on... Drive into the plaza where Subway/Honey Hut ice cream is located, and go to the corner of the plaza. Walk towards the corner and the restaurant is on the right.  Sorry, as I said, it was a late lunch and I was famished so I bit into my wrap before I could take a photo!  Oh No...  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out this place on the way to the Rocksino.  They have a full bar and decent beer selection. It was around 6pm on a Saturday night. Extremely bustling with a one hour wait to sit outside. Luckily there was a booth inside.  We ordered the Texas Tumbleweed with chicken with pepper dressing and a small pizza.  The food was excellent.  However it did take some time getting to the table."}
{"text":"This place is more like a restaurant than a museum cafe.  No foil wrapped burgers here...   Yum, for the tostada salad and the chicken tacos.  Prickly pear lemonade was refreshing.    The grounds are beautiful and with the outdoor fountains, you get a very serene feeling.  We ate here before entering the musem, but you can certainly just go here for a meal since it is in a separate building."}
{"text":"Charming with indoor and outdoor seating.  Excellent food - menu was refreshingly special and they executed it with ease.  Service was very friendly and responsive.  We would come back just to eat here.  A treasure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot! Always super busy, but worth the wait. No matter what I order the food is always amazing and the fries are to die for! the service is great, I don't think I've ever had a complaint here. Even the take out is amazing, the guy who puts the order together is super attentive to everything that goes in the bag and he double and triple checks to make sure you have everything and its all right. Never a disappointment when we go here."}
{"text":"Food was great, came out fast but our waitress was not very nice. Would've gave 5 stars but the waitress needs a personality adjustment."}
{"text":"This place has the best rolls!  It's casual with a large menu and yummy daily specials. My coworkers get their food a lot at the office and it makes me drool!  Most recently I caught myself drooling over a mushroom pizza, some sort of quesadilla, and shrimp tacos... I am a big fan of their salads too."}
{"text":"Nice dinning environment in a nice museum, but the menu is a little bit limited. Good as a tourist attraction dining option, but do not recommend come here just for the food."}
{"text":"This is definite a sure thing when you are on the \"Southside\" and are looking for a tavern-like experience and food.  The food I've had has always been good, and sitting at the bar I've always met with friendly folks and conversation.  Great traditional American food, but they do get extremely busy on the weekends and service (especially at the bar).  Highly recommend it if in town."}
{"text":"Cafe in the museum complex.  I had the chicken lime soup which was spectacular. My friend enjoyed the hummus veggie wrap.  It was a little spendy-$9 for a bowl of soup. But it was good to eat and not have to leave the museum."}
{"text":"Courtyard IS Brecksville's BEST restaurant as well top in the South of Cleveland area. The staff is always on top of their game and very friendly. The decor is vintage with Cleveland historical artificats etc all over the walls. The Food is AMAZING and is always the same when you come back and get it again.  Top food items: Chicken or Tuna Salad, Filet, Fish, Pasta, Filet wrap, any of their soups and salads you can't go wrong with!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots to eat! The menu offers a variety of choices for even the pickiest of eaters! I have tried at least 1/2 of their selections and I have yet to be disappointed. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and fun. This is a great spot to grab drinks, have a quick dinner, or meet up with a group of friends. Their blueberry muffins are the best in the world! If you can get Jen as your waitress I def recommend it. She is sweet, funny, and attentive.   My favorites: Caprese Salad with Chicken, Fillet Croissant, Pizza (any, but esp the Hawaiian), Mahi, French Loaf, Spud (twice baked potato), French Onion Soup, Muffins!   Great food, great fun!"}
{"text":"The Cafe is located off the courtyard near the Heard Museum. The food and service were outstanding and, by checking in on Yelp, we got free glasses of prickly pear cactus lemonade, a real treat. The food was Southwest Mexican style and was very good, although some dishes are quite spicy, so you should ask if that is a problem. As the Museum allows visitors to exit and re-enter, we were able to take a break from the Museum and return after lunch."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Recommend the courtyard club or the French onion soup. Rotating muffin selection available with many of the entrees as a side. Blueberry is the best! Staff is very personable!"}
{"text":"While although the courtyard is not primarily known for its Pizza, and offers a wider variety of food fair, I am going to review their pizza. This pizza is Fantastic Excellent.  I must say...I'm torn between making this my new #1 pizza destination or keeping my current. The plus about this pizza is EVERYTHING is fresh.  Sauce, meat, veggies, dough ALL OF IT.  Great tasting pizza in a bit of an unsuspecting place The only draw back is that their pizzas are smaller than a typical pizza parlor but for what it lacks in size is definitely made up for in taste. Their hours don't always make family pizza time easy, however its worth it when you can get it! Drew Carrey needs to stop here as I would put money down he hasn't."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dine in experience. The ambience was kinda cute and they have a nice little outdoor patio/courtyard. I ordered the French onion soup and a crispy grouper wrap with Cajun French fries. The soup was phenomenal. The cheese was melting and hot right out the oven like you want it in a French onion. The onions were mild and the broth was very well made and seasoned. The crispy grouper wrap was incredible. The fish was tender and crispy and extremely fresh. It came with some sort of creamy sauce on the side that I couldn't get enough of. The fries were very well seasoned and definitely a generous portion. They were homemade and hand cut with the skin on like I like them. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area again. They had a very nice and extensive menu. Might try a fish entree next time!"}
{"text":"I love the Texas Tumbleweed salad here - totally a unhealthy yet delicious take on salads but i figure I'm still getting the leafy greens :) the peppercorn ranch is excellent too! Plus the huge French bread roll is fresh and delicious!  It's my goto cheat salad! :)"}
{"text":"The food is decent and prices are as expected. I have had some friendly staff, however, on multiple occasions have been aggressively hinted that people are waiting and it's time to go. Anything on the table is picked away at until one time we were bluntly asked to leave. The theme that I noticed is that we were the youngest (mid 20's) around. Also, the male manager isn't worth approaching because he is not sympathetic. So unless you're older than 40, I'd say pick a different place."}
{"text":"Best ribeye I've hadn't in a long time. Good service and good martinis."}
{"text":"Well it all started about 25 years ago my wife, girlfriend at the time, brought me here for a burger for my birthday and it has been our favorite place ever since. If your looking for great food, great service and great people, the courtyard is your place. Burgers, ribs, seafood, pizza or sandwiches all are tasty and affordable.  There isn't anything on the menu that I would not recommend.  Michael, Susan and all the staff have been there for years and have treated our family like their own.  Thank you to all the staff at the courtyard, we have spent many weekends and special occasions there and look forward to many many more.   So if your wondering if you should give it a try, we'll take my advice and go for it. 25 years will go by quickly.  Eric table of...."}
{"text":"Been going here since 1989- still to this day one of my favorite restaurants ever. Always consistent never ever a bad meal."}
{"text":"The Courtyard Cafe is probably one of Brecksville's greatest treasures. My only complaint about this location is that they aren't open on Sundays--the night when my family is typically craving going out to dinner.  Decor/atmosphere: a bit crowded, a bit noisy, but fun and full of local charm. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to get the saxophone table! Regardless of where you sit, there is local memorabilia hung everywhere in the restaurant and you'll likely spend more time paying attention to it than spending time with whoever accompanied you. Or you can watch a game on their giant tv's!  Service: friendly, attentive, and accommodating. You can tell that the servers make friends with the regulars (although, honestly half of Brecksville is probably a regular here!) and they pay attention to your needs even if they are being run off their feet, as they were New Year's Eve. But they also handed out noisemakers and hats! We actually made reservations NYE, but they lost our reservation and we had to wait for a table. But it was worth it. We were seated in a half an hour (impressive for the line that was out the door!) and the staff was attentive in visiting the line and answering questions that people had. They also gave us hats and noisemakers while we were waiting!  Food: Splendiferous. And so much of it. If you're feeling indulgent, get the cheesy garlic bread, but I adore their French bread--more like a loaf! They give you practically a whole loaf! And warm... so fresh. I've always wanted to try their french onion soup, but find it a bit intimidating. Last time I was here, I ordered one of their entrees and ended up taking half of it home! There are so many sides and add-ons, it's like two or three meals! At my most recent visit, I wised up and got a salad with salmon. Still got that tasty french bread but was only full when I finished, not stuffed!   Family favorites: The Courtyard Burger. Dad swears this is the best burger he's ever had in his life. I don't think he'll ever order anything else. We also really love the salad with spinach, walnuts, and strawberries. Add some salmon to make it a meal! And their fish dishes! Never been disappointed in their fish, which is always a bonus since fish can be difficult. And that french bread! Mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I have always liked this suburban restaurant in a strip mall. I tell people to get the Twice Baked Potato and the Grilled Tuna. They really do seafood right at this restaurant.   I love to take my children out to dinner. They have an advanced taste in food.   I was a little perplexed that when I ordered wings and ribs at these two items were not sauced. In fact, the sauce was served to the side. What??  I asked a simple request to have the Chicken Wings sauced. You would have thought that I asked them to part the sea.   The word NO should be taken out of the hospitality dictionary! So, I heard the GM or owner say just dump it over the wings!  I informed our server that the kitchen staff should make a trip to Buffalo to learn how wings are made properly. I even showed them a picture of Anchor Bar Wings.   Food great! Don't order wings or ribs as you will be disappointed.  Also, if I go out to eat I appreciate having my food packed in the kitchen. I don't appreciate doing it at the table."}
{"text":"Has a broad traditional menu.  Food consistently very good.  Usually busy for dine-in.  Carry-out service is good, which I use often.  Locally owned small business.  They aren't trying to be cutting edge, but they are very good at what they do.  Better alternative to popular chains."}
{"text":"After spending a chilly morning at the Brecksville Nature Center in the Metroparks feeding chickadees, my boyfriend and I wanted to grab some quick grub for lunch. I used my trusty Yelp app and found The Courtyard Cafe.   Nestled in a bustling strip mall, I didn't expect much, but I was really pretty pleased with this restaurant. You can definitely tell that it's a locally owned establishment - but in a good way. There's all kinds of neat Cleveland memorabilia on the walls and there's a huge bar area. It's so nicely decorated that you wouldn't know you're in a strip mall, if that makes any sense.   I ordered a half avocado sandwich and a half garden salad. Hooray for vegan food! My sandwich was really good. Instead of using a sauce to flavor the veggie sandwich, they used super fresh guacamole. I was impressed. (nothing is sadder than wilted or gross guac) My boyfriend ordered a burger, fries, and a cup of their French onion soup. He liked his meal although the fries were a little bland.   Overall, The Courtyard Cafe seems like a great little local restaurant, and if I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely stop back."}
{"text":"I must like this place - my wife and I have been coming here for well over 20 years. They usually have an unusual and extremely tasty soup of the day. The specials always seem to be very good and the staff is always good. If you have never been to the Courtyard you should consider it for lunch or dinner when in the Brecksville area."}
{"text":"good food and service but alot of food so come hungry"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at the Cafe at the Heard Museum! Ordered the posole, which was a generous bowl of pork/hominy/chili soup.  Delicious!  But for some reason it was served with an unusually small tortilla.  The coffee was excellent, a flavorful brew.  Our server was cheerful and attentive.  The cafe had a warm inviting atmosphere and was doing a good business.    This cafe is far superior to the museum's previous cafe.  Looking forward to another lunch here!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant,  fantastic variety  of food with great service.  The filet sandwich is awesome and the potato skins are a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I don't understand the overall rating so I just keep coming back because the location is cute and convenient but I've never really enjoyed anything I've ordered (French onion soup, twice baked potato, various sandwiches and desserts). Service is also slow when the lunch rush hits so it's hard to get back to the office...I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Our family has been visiting the Head Museum since the 1980s, so there is a strong connection to the place and a great appreciation for the progress and diversity of the museum.  The cafe is set nicely in the museum courtyard, with a modern fountain, elegant sculptures, mature trees, the open vista beyond the terrance was comfortable and beautiful. The weather was an almost perfect April in AZ ---though a bit breezy.  The cafe has both outdoor and indoor seatings and a revised menu. Elizabeth and I shared a delightful cold chili shrimp appetizer;  accompanied by a small green salad topped with sunflower seeds, my grilled cheese with mushrooms and red onion satisfied completely. Elizabeth's quesadilla with roasted vegetables, guacamole, and crème fraîche was excellent.  Our server, Jody, was fun and efficient and gave the atmosphere and extra 10 points!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I loved the prickly pear lemonade and Margarita. My husband and I sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings. Our server was amazing. She recommended all of our dishes and each one was superb."}
{"text":"What a lovely setting! I had the posole, which was yummy and filling but even better . . . the Prickly Pear Margarita. It was so good I had to ask for the recipe (Casa Noble Crystal Tequila, 100% Organic Blue Agave and Prickly Pear Syrup. Spectacular! BTW, service was stellar."}
{"text":"I organized a meal for a party of 35 people here. The service was fast as the whole group placed their order within 10 minutes of our arrival and the food was on the table another 15 minutes later. Multiple items on the menu were ordered and those in attendance had nothing but positive things to say about their meal. Pretty impressive to serve a party of that size and have the tables cleared within 45 minutes tops!"}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch. I tried their salmon with pilaf and steamed veggies and pesto chicken sandwich.. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I'll definitely go there again. Looks like it is going to become my new favorite near my office"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.  Every time we head back to the Cleveland area, this is a MUST hit place.  Casual, quality and delicious!  Reasonably priced.   Always a winner!!!"}
{"text":"If you want a place where you can drink a nice cocktail or beer accompanied by an assortment of quality sandwiches, fresh fish or unique burgers courtyard cafe is the place for you. Wonderful staff great atmosphere just an all around great place to dine."}
{"text":"The food for this cafe is actually pretty darn good. I order the grilled cheese with a side salad and regular Lemonade. First the cheese in the grilled cheese was fresh, the bread was toasted and the grilled onions with the mushrooms gave it perfect taste. The side salad was the perfect size for a side meal. Most side salads are either huge or really small but this was perfect and the flavored vinaigrette really added a nice taste to it. Our service was really nice too, our waitress was super nice refilling our beverages."}
{"text":"Beautiful weather. Clear blue skies. Sunny and warm out about 70 degrees with a cool breeze. Wonderful courtyard setting with fountains and well manicured grounds. Terrific food and service. Sounds like a romantic scene out of a movie? Too good to be true?  I would have thought that too, except I actually experienced it. Definitely not any typical museum cafe. The menu is limited but what they offer is an eclectic selection of gourmet type sandwiches, appetizers, and cocktails.  On the day we visited it was a stunningly clear sunny day. Before heading into the Heard Museum we decided to grab some lunch here. Perfect choice! Started with the prickly pear lemonade. Only $3.50 for a large glass and our waiter brought over a carafe of it for our table. We ordered two of the most delicious sandwiches. Turkey, brie, and sliced granny smith apples on toasted walnut cranberry bread. Panko crusted chicken sandwich with fresh mozzarella, tomato, and pesto sauce on ciabatta bread. Both were quite big and filling for only $13 each. They came with a side garden salad or quinoa salad. The waiter told us the quinoa salad made with with black beans was a favorite and we could see why - it was mighty tasty.   This was like Heaven. If there were only some hammocks or recliners on the grounds to take a nap after our meal would have made it even better. It was so nice out we really did not want to leave but we had to give ourselves enough time to view the museum."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to this place, I am amazed at the crowd. There's a line from the dining room to the door and people don't mind standing there for a half hour. I don't get it. I usually end up at Simon's, Creekside or Austin's rather than wait for this place. That's not to say it is a lousy restaurant, just that it isn't my kind of place. I can't seem to find a go-to item on the menu that's worth the expense, the wait, and the hassle.  One time I had a special called, 'Mulagatawny Soup' which was one of the best soups I've ever had. I never saw it again. I've had burgers and sandwiches and salmon entrees here and none of them made me glad to have been there. The fries aren't bad but they're not worth the sat-fat they're soaked in. Too many sandwiches made with croissants.  It is worth mentioning,though, that everyone I know who has been there totally disagrees with me. To them, Courtyard is a good place worth going to fairly often. I have seen the you're-an-idiot-look more than a few times when I say I don't really like the Courtyard. I want a ten dollar hamburger to make me happy...at least for a little while...  Still, they give you amazing muffins with your meal and the Guinness is always cold and fresh. The patio is cool, too."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been here, but I wanted to post this review because of all the positive reviews this place has. Do not eat here! This place is very dirty, employees do not wear gloves, kitchen and service staff all touch food with bare hands! Also manager Micheal and the owner are not only rude to customers, but are abusive POS' to their staff!!!"}
{"text":"Completely worth the visit. The french onion soup was delicious. The french dip is alright. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"First...NO WIFI.....It is very important in this day and age.    So, I go with my daughter to enjoy a nice modest early dinner. You know, a salad and a shared side.  Let's start with the side...their hand-cut french fries.  Awesome!..nuff said.    We both selected a \"Texas Tumbleweed\" salad.  It sounds great on the menu, but the deal is..it's not what is delivered...well, not entirely. The salad is described as \"greens\" with .....etc... But, what you get is iceburg lettuce. Seriously, noone offers iceburg lettuce on a menu unless you are in podunk Kansas. To me greens are a variety of baby lettuces, baby spinach, arugula, endive, red cabbages,  etc....very healthy stuff.  THAT is greens.   NOT iceburg lettuce....EVER.  So, be prepared.  The accompanyment of breaded mushrooms, however, was really good. The crunchy onion toppings was great also, but, much too much. You literally had to move it all off to begin to eat.  They should accompany the salad, not overwhelm it. But, alas.   The \"French\" bread option is good also, but ask for olive oil for dipping because.. Ready for this?...they only offer MARGERINE!...No real butter.  No kidding.  And where can you find such nonsense on a menu....at the aformentioned podunk dive in Kansas. Once again, we all know just how incredibly dangerous margerine is, I am really amazed that it is still offered anywhere at all. And why?  Cheap....so, that drags my ratings down a notch for this place. You shouldn't have such a stylistic menu with the effort of quality and then try to get away with CHEAP...it only ruins the experience and the quality of the meal you came to enjoy."}
{"text":"I popped in real quick looking for a last minute to go option. They made my order quickly and had me out the door in less than 10 minutes. The tumbleweed salad was so good. Who would have thought breaded mushrooms on a salad.... Yum!"}
{"text":"About as solid and old school as restaurants get. This is a great place to go if you have a craving for a burger, chicken sammy or french dip. The fresh cut, skin-on fries are what french fries should be.   Don't let the spate of geriatrics fool you-- this place is great for families or for friends out to watch sports and have a bite. They have a great kid's menu with lots of options-- applesauce or veggies instead of fries.   The service is ultra fast and very accommodating. Refills are nearly instantaneous. You want it, you got it! It's really amazing considered how completely packed the place always seems to be."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch.  We'll, 15 years ago, it was great..... But not any more.    The food was beyond dreadful.  No seasoning, no herbs, not even salt and pepper!    The salads, the seafood, nothing was seasoned.  The so-called potato salad was cooked potatoes, skin on, and no dressing or seasoning of ANY kind.  The whole salmon was good.  The cooked shrimp were ok.... Hard to screw that up.    The eggs Benedict you have to order.  You wait half an hour.... And you get an uncooked egg.  You order again, wait 45 minutes, it's hard boiled.    The couple beside me had the same experience, they were in before me, so I saw it.  Desserts were ok.   Service was truly dreadful.  They definitely need more servers/staff for a room that large.   Check out the King Edward Hotel brunch, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"This is one of two GREAT restaurants in Brecksville. If you haven't tried their clam chowder - do it. If you haven't tried their chicken chef salad with only romaine and with peppercorn dressing - do it. If you haven't tried their french bread - do it. You pretty much can't go wrong. Also, their staff is always friendly and courteous and willing to do what they can to meet your expectations."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  Love the chicken salad with sherbet side!  Big portions, nicely cooked, well priced.  Only down side is the cramped dining area - but you can get it to take out!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch (groupon) I usually check the reviews from yelp before go to restaurants. I was pretty shocked after looked at the reviews for this cafe... all the reviews complain about the brunch buffet... But I like it, although it does not worth $37 per person (groupon) croissant is really good, i ate smoked salmon, cooked salmon, chicken breast, and a daily special (the cheese roll? sth. like that, it is really good) they have roast beef instead of steak, which disappointed me a lot although i don't love meat, but someone does haha!!! Dessert is good. you have a lot of choices but tastes just so-so. Service is good. Orange juice, Coffee is included in the price. I won't come back again for the brunch buffet, but I bought a afternoon tea groupon and im gonna try it later:)"}
{"text":"Courtyard Cafe is a very straightforward restaurant with great food.  Tried burgers, pizza, soups and salads - all fresh and full of flavor.  Often crowded for a reason - never had to wait longer than ten minutes.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here 3 or 4 times and found the food quite good. That said I did find it extremely loud. Guess I was too stupid to go out to the patio (courtyard). This time we did. Went here for lunch with my wife and got Steve for a waiter. One of the best waiters I ever had. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay served in a clay cast filled with ice. Divine and only 16 bucks! We ordered an appetizer... a generous wheel of baked brie which came with slice almonds, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, and warm succulent flat bread. We were full. All I can say is what an incredible lunch. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The Courtyard Cafe is one of my favorite local restaurants in Brecksville. It's always packed with people, and the service is consistently wonderful.           I waited 30 minutes in line for a table and another 30 minutes for food for a table of three, but it was without a doubt worth it. Personally, I love wraps, so I had to try the chicken club wrap. All of the wraps are made with a sun dried tomato wrap and has a tomato slice and lettuce on the side.            I ordered the wrap with a side of fries, and I finished every last bite. The chicken club wrap came with a small container of dressing that was delicious, and the fries were crunchy and perfect.            I recommend Courtyard Cafe for causal dinners or lunches and even special events. The food is always served hot and fresh and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"A group of ten of us went for lunch recently. To be honest I had never even heard of the Courtyard Cafe before, but not living in the Brecksville area, cut me some slack.   Because of the size of our group (I'm guessing), we had two servers who were very attentive. It was quite crowded so figured this must be a good place to eat.   I ordered the Cajun fish sandwich and it was very good, just the right amount of heat. I did encounter two bones in the fish however.   The entire group seemed pleased with their orders overall. I ordered an extra dirty martini served up and it was perfect.   I would return if in the area, but not sure I would drive the 35 minutes again as my destination for lunch."}
