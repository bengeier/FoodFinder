{"text":"Top choice for Pho in Charlotte. The service is very fast and friendly. The servers have a great sense of humor! The food is consistently delicious and the prices are fantastic! Definitely hard to beat on the east side. My kid loves it so it's a winner in our family!"}
{"text":"What this place lacks in looks it makes up for in deliciousness! So good! Just look around, when everyone is being quiet because they are too busy eating to speak you know the place is a winner.. Try a combination bowl or vermicelli noodles with grilled shrimp and pork.."}
{"text":"One of the restaurants that we often visit. The Pho are great. The porstion is right. The environment is okay."}
{"text":"I'm Asian (not Vietnamese), with a good appreciation of a good pho bo (beef noodles) when I see one.  The pho bo here is the best I've tried in Charlotte imo:  Their broth, which is the key to a good pho, is flavourful with the right balance of beef, bones and herbs, but I also noticed some MSG in there too.  Out of a few pho places around CLT (Saigon, Doan, Vietnam Grill, Truc) I think they have the best pho soup here.  More importantly, their pho is served HOT - makes a hell of a difference for me who like to put almost all the garnishes into the soup, and my pho stays at the right temperature when I'm half way through it.  This seems to be a small detail that many other places overlook.    Prices are also more in line with those in NYC and California.  You really shouldn't have to pay more than $8 or $9 for a regular pho these days.  The location is a bit meh, but for such a good pho I'm willing to make the trip there frequently."}
{"text":"I come here almost once a week religiously for the pho.  This is a franchise chain of the american-inspired Pho Hoa.  If you've been to one in the states before, the menu is the same.    What I love about this restaurant is that their tendon never disappoints me.  I love tendon, and have it everytime I eat pho.  Their pho is absolutely first-rate; best i've had in the toronto area so far.  I've also tried their Mung (vermicelli bowls), and they are very authentic.  Their deep fried spring rolls are nothing to boast about though.  They use the chinese wrapping, and keep it at the smaller size which I don't enjoy.  Usually, the vietnamese ones are much larger and are wrapped differently."}
{"text":"I've actually been to the Pho Hoa chain in the following cities: Chicago, Edmonton, Vancouver. This one is definitely the worst.  First of all this place is so dirty. Big turnoff. Secondly they do not serve normal Sriracha sauce, it's this weird orange flavor Sriracha. How can you fuck up Sriracha?!?!?!  Food: 2 Service: 3 Ambience: 1 Overall: 1 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving Pho; I've driven by this place about a 100 times and didn't know it was there.  She saw it and it was a quick decision to try it.  What this place lacks in looks it makes up for in taste and service.  Don't expect overly attentive five start American Service.  Except great service and great food!  So good! Just look around, when everyone is being quiet because they are too busy digging in you know you have a winner!  More so, this place is authentic.  If you're ever second guessing this place because of appearances, try it and your taste buds will thank you later!"}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese, I hate to write a bad review for one of my own but my experience with this restaurant was just ridiculous. I was visiting some friends in Charlotte a couple weeks ago and was craving pho so they recommended this place. I stopped by and ordered it to go. When one of the employees brought my food out, I specifically asked if there was Sriracha sauce and he adamantly assured me that there was. Ok, thanks! I bring my food back and open the container - no sriracha sauce. Alright, that's ok I can improvise with some Texas Pete I found in my friend's fridge. Next, I find that the broth was cold. This place was only a 4 minute drive from my friend's place so I know it didn't magically freeze from the arctic 80 degree weather. Yes, nobody likes finding their food cold but it's extremely important for pho broth to be as hot as possible when served because THE BEEF IS SERVED RAW (the hot broth is supposed to cook it and for take out, the beef is packed raw next to the noodles, not in the broth). Cold broth, raw meat - this was not the convenient take out I had in mind. So I had to apologetically rummage through my friend's kitchen and reboil my broth. When my food was finally ready, I sat down and took out the chopsticks they had provided. Oh what do you know? To complete this wonderful experience, there was dust and mold all over the chopsticks. Fluke? They gave me 4 pairs and as I pulled them out pair after pair - all dust and mold. I still feel nauseous thinking about them."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here at least once a week. Their food is fantastic. We especially love their Pho. If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out."}
{"text":"If I had a dollar for every time a friend said \"Vietnamese food is great, I love Pho\" I would have enough money to go back to this place right now and get another bowl of this amazing soup.  This was my first experience eating Pho and I was not disappointed.  I opted for the vegetarian bowl with Tofu, but they had a ton of different meats they add to these for you carnivorous types.  The service was fast, the food was filling and delicious and the atmosphere was casual.  I love good food from all over the world, and thanks to Pho Hoa, I can add Pho to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"I have to preface this by saying that we ordered via Postmates - so maybe in the restaurant it is different. My husband liked his pho well enough, but said that his favorite is still lang van. I ordered the vermicelli with prawns (definitely 3 small shrimp...) and pork. I didn't care for the pork - maybe others would, but the flavoring and overall look/texture of it was not appealing. The lettuce was shredded like from an inexpensive taco place (or like taco salads back in middle school), but overall the dish itself tasted fresh and ok. The fried rolls were good, but I haven't really met poor ones. Overall, I prefer Vietnam Grill or Lang Van for Vietnamese food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I just moved from Southend over to Plaza Midwood and have been exploring the hood for some good go to spots. So glad I found this place! I ordered takeout on a rainy weekend and it did not disappoint. The Steak & Brisket Pho was amazing! The broth was so flavorful without adding anything addition. I like things spicy so I added jalapeños, a touch or hoisin sauce and some sriracha. Also, this place has BUBBLE TEA! I have been looking everywhere for a place and finally found one. I went with a suggestion and got the avocado bubble tea. I was a little hesitant because I wanted something more fruity, but I'm so glad I tired this. I can honestly say it was the best bubble tea I have ever had, NYC and all. It was sweet and so refreshing! You have to stop in!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Papaya salad in Charlotte!!!!   Great pho, vermicelli, service, everything (:"}
{"text":"Finally, I return to the quite & cleanness restaurant again. I had a special pho for the lunch. It was huge as usual, and I still cannot finish it. However, the service here was still nice. Same people and  new menu for a couple years reminded me of couple stories. lol....  Let me tell you the reason why I gave five star on the review for the food and the restaurant! First of all, the meat is always fresh, and the soup still is my flavor dish for past several years. Compared to other pho, I believe that Pho Hong Ha always makes the soup by using  fresh beef bond and fresh meat. That's why I can always taste and smell the meat flavor from the broth all the time.   Secondly, Pho Hong Ha is the hugest pho restaurant in the Great Toronto area, and it always keep the place clean as much as possible. I saw that the management team try so hard to maintain the quality and service. The service is other remarkable memory for me as well. They always tries to bring new 'blood' to the restaurant. Rather hiring a more \"experienced\" waiter/ess, the waiter/ess always have a proper attitude to the customers. They do like their job and pretty enjoy with the environment. So I can really see the teamwork in this workplace.    However, Pho Hong Ha did have several revolution during the past twenty years, from changing the franchise to the management owned, we can see that they attempted to make the restaurant better. Different from other pho restaurant, Pho Hong Ha tries to maintain their tradition and principle based on the culture and background of the pho. They always make the pho simple, and it is exactly what am I looking for. Others make that so complex, mixed with different cultures. However, I cannot accept it personally.    Wish you do have same experience and point of view with me!  Recommendation: Special Pho, Spring Roll, Fruit Smoothies,Rice Combination."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for Pho! First of all the waitstaff is always pleasant and the service is fast! There are times, that I have eaten here several times a week. The food is fresh, the portions are large and flavorable. You will NOT be disappointed! Go...right now...really go."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly fast and the staff extremely friendly! The chicken pho had a great taste as well as the pork roll appetizer."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of the old Pho Hoa years ago because it had the best pho broth in Scarborough. Then it slowly deteriorated in both consistency and flavour.  Now with the recent name change, things are even WORSE. There is barely any pho taste in the broth, just 2 tons of salt & MSG. I literally drank a litre of water afterwards and was still thirsty. The noodles were UNDER cooked & tough even after sitting in the broth. The worst part? They jacked up the prices as well. XL size is now $9.99 instead of $8.3.  You'd think that by leaving the Pho Hoa franchise to save on fees would mean that they could afford to spend more money on better ingredients but NO. The new owner cheap out on the broth and probably switched to a lower grade noodle, THEN jacked up the prices."}
{"text":"Before I walked into the restaurant for the first time I had concerns about the cleanliness.  One look at the glass door and I knew this restaurant was not clean.  Why did I eat here anyway?  I was meeting a party and couldn't say \"no\".  I ordered vegetarian given my concerns.  Food was average and I know various Asian types of food pretty well.   The biggest mistake I made was going to the restroom.  Absolutely disgusting and clearly is never serviced.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was 10. I always order the Pho Ga (chicken pho) and it always taste authentic and delicious! The prices have increased a bit but regardless the portions are still very large!"}
{"text":"Yum. The phó is is flavorful and presented exactly as it should be. A plentiful plate of basil, lime and sprouts come with every bowl. The servers are friendly and helpful. Summer rolls come out within minutes and your bowl of pho or bun is not far behind.  Overall a a great dining experience. Not for the atmosphere, solely for the food."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has some incredible Pho!  You've got to try it!!"}
{"text":"I have never had pho before today, but after hearing how awesome of a dish it is, I decided today was the day. pho Hoa keeps it simple it seems. There's a section on the menu for beginners (aka me) that has easy to identify meats, and pretty much straightforward with ingredients. I went with steak and fatty flank. The large bowl is ENORMOUS and could easily fill three people or serve three meals for one person. I LOVE the plate of fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, Thai basil and jalapeño. The taste of Fresh ingredients is something I love in this great world of food, and this def hits the nail on the head.  Perfect amount of spice in the broth, and def could be a saving hangover cure, or just a good comforting meal on a cold day.  Being that this was only my first time, I gave it three stars simply because I don't know if pho hoa offers \"THE BEST\" or \"most authentic\" pho. I will def be coming back though, hungry as ever!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and this is probably the best pho I've ever had. It really stands out from other pho I've had lately, and has very quickly become my favorite pho in the area. I haven't tried much other than the pho, but I had part of a noodle and pork dish(I believe its number 30 or 32 on the menu) and the pork was delicious- seasoned well, cooked well, and flavorful. The rest of the dish, which mostly consisted of noodles and a few veggies, was a little dry. I tried some bubble tea here my first visit, and I have to say that the green apple flavor is one to avoid. It's thick, and tastes far too strong and artificial. It gave me the impression that they used way too much of the mix for making the drink and not enough water. When I poured a little water in it it was much more bearable, but even after that the flavor was just okay. However, a friend tried the soursop and thought it was very delicious. The pearls were not quite as sweet as I like them, but I think I prefer them sweeter than most people. Never really had any trouble with service, I found it a little slow my last trip, but otherwise they're very nice. Overall this is a great place and I will continue to visit! Not to be confused with Pho An Hoa, another restaurant close by."}
{"text":"Careful...not a 5 star spot, choppy service to say the least, BUT, the food is authentic and tasty.  I always get Pho or Vermicelli...the rolls fresh and spring are decent too."}
{"text":"Best pho in Charlotte. I usually eat pho on a bi-weekly basis, so I have tried every spot in Charlotte. Pho Hoa has the best balance of flavors in their pho broth. My go to is the 44... gotta love the fatty flank, tendon, and tripe. The staff is super friendly, so don't be afraid to ask for off-menu specials. My favorite is Mi Quang (pronounced me waang as far I as can tell). Get the avocado shake for dessert."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me this long to phind this place. Awesome and authentic experience for Charlotte! Yay Pho and tsingtao lunch :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Pho places this is not nasty but not great. Here I got way too many fillers and not enough noodles or chicken. My advice cut down on the extra veggies and put in more of the actual Pho ingredients...noodles, chicken, & broth. I'll be getting my Pho from somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is not $, it's overpriced. The food quality is ok to decent, not the best for the price. Traditional and family owned feel. Employees are friendly. Doesn't seem like the cleanest if places even though they have the place decorated."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is so much better than Lang Van! The vermicelli with pork and chicken is amazing! The fried noodles with seafood is so tasty! And it has so much add-ons: celery, mushrooms, carrot, broccoli - it's freaking tasty! The shrimp spring rolls are so soft and fresh too! I've been back so many times now, thought I'd write up a good review ;)"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch and had an extra large bowl of Pho that was extremely pricy-it came up to $11.30.  The broth was stale and flavourless-disgusting, really.  Very little meats, and beef lining was given.  The service here was terrible. There were only two other tables and 3 staff were working, but yet it took almost 5 minutes to get one of them to realize that we wanted to pay the check and leave. One was too busy on her phone and another was just inattentive.   I gave a 0% tip and I will never be making a return again. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Love the fresh ingredients and different flavors. Really enjoyed our meals and will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I go here every Sunday almost for the authentic pho. I ask for the steak on the side so it comes uncooked, and then I put it in the hot pho broth (which is amazing) to get it done to the perfect rareness. The vegetarian and the seafood pho are also good choices. You MUST finish with a 'bubble tea' - what they call their boba drink, a smoothie with tapioca pearls (I've had bubble tea all over the U.S. and Pho Hoa does the best - perfectly firm tapioca) - I recommend these flavors: mocha, taro, green tea, Vietnamese coffee or Avacado. Just try it...you can thank me later!"}
{"text":"Great Pho.  Time after time I try someplace closer to home and time after time I wish I'd have gone to Pho Hoa. Rich broth, oodles of noodles and just nice guys. Try it, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My previous review stands... but just realized today that Pho Hoa opens up at 8:30 am.  Hot diggity dog, over the last year or so I've tired of the standard breakfast joints in town. Now I can have a hot bowl of Pho for breakfast, can you think of anything better on a cold winter morning ? Yes winter is a few months away, but I'm sure I'll sneak a couple of bowls of Pho for breakfast before then"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent pho and great staff. Been here numerous times and never had a complaint."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho spot in Charlotte! The papaya salad is my favorite appetizers. The owners are very friendly and personable. I would definitely recommend this place to other people!"}
{"text":"May not be the best pho I've ever had, but definitely the second best one. Actually, the most cost effective one that contains so much meat. I tried five different pho stores in my 10-day trip, it's the best one. Very tasty soup, and I highly recommend this store! BTW: the bubble tea is amazing, I love it too!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little disgusted by this place before I even walked in. There were tons of cigarette butts all over the front of their restaurant. Their pho tasted okay. The bean sprouts that came with it, however, were browning and did not look fresh."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful staff. A lot of places you go in and you get greeted by a grumpy old person. Everyone here was happy and jolly. It puts you in a great mood to enjoy their delicious pho. If you're looking for a good pho restaurant to go to. You def gotta check these guys out!"}
{"text":"I came here very excited to order my favorite vietnamese soup called Hu Tieu..  I asked them to include meatballs and the server told me \"No, does not come with meatball\" .. Ok.. not the end of the world. The soup came, it was delicious and I was almost done when suddenly I saw a very bright blue, thin, rubber band swimming in my noodles!  YUM! :-(  My husband got the waiters attention and we showed him the rubber band. He did not apologize, but reacted upset and immediately started speaking loudly to the other staff and then looked to my husband and asked if I wanted a new bowl. I did NOT want a new bowl.. I had immediately lost my appetite. But to my surprise when we went to check out, they did not give us the soup for a discount or even offer a slight apology! Later, when I told the story to my friends.. I was informed a similar situation had happened to them also, except I should be glad It was only a rubber band, because they found a cigarette in their soup!"}
{"text":"I've never had Pho in my life.  My brother and sister in law were home for Thanksgiving and we decided to try Pho Hoa.  So amazing.  I can't wait to go back.  If i were sick, I'd come here and just ask for the broth and noodles-that's how good it is.  So many flavors, and I loved them all!  My sister got a lavender bubble tea to go which she seemed to enjoy.  Next time I'm in the mood for anything with noodles, I'm going to remember that this place is top of my list."}
{"text":"First off I was greeted politely and seated right away . The restaurant was half full at 3:00 pm on NYD . I ordered some Thai tea, and some spring rolls. The tea was very good and the rolls were fresh. Peanut sauce was good too. Then I ordered the pho with brisket and seafood. I personal do this because it makes the broth more complex. The broth needed a bit more star anise and beef flavor for my taste, but that's me being picky. The sprouts , cilantro , jalapeño , and basil were fresh and came out with the soup. All in all a very good experience. I would eat there again and bring some friends."}
{"text":"Pho Hoa was a staple restaurant that I used to go to a million times with my family when they had a location in the metro Atlanta area.  I basically grew up eating pho from this franchise.  I was hardcore craving some pho tonight, so a few coworkers and I went to go try it out, based on the rave reviews.  Upon pulling up at the rather run down looking shopping center and ugly facade of the restaurant, my coworkers all looked at me like I was nuts for taking them to some run-down building in what seemed like the boonies (but obviously wasn't).  The inside was much more promising than the outside and there was a steady dinner crowd on a Wednesday night, which is pretty good considering that place is basically a lone gem on that stretch of road.  I've had one other pho place in Charlotte - Pho Plus in Uptown.  My coworker and I agreed Pho Hoa was better.  The broth and spice was super flavorful and on point and the meat amount was reasonable.  The prices here are slightly higher than I've paid in Atlanta, but it's still 100% worth it.  I got the steak (which could have been more rare, in my opinion, if I had anything to complain about), tripe (yum!), tendon, and beef ball soup.  You can build your own pho here, which allows you to customize.  Their menu is set up in a way that helps pho-beginners choose their dishes and more experienced-pho'kers to more complex dishes.  The appetizers are so-so here - cha gio (fried spring rolls) are filled with juicy and flavorful meat and comes with the standard nuoc mam (fish sauce).  The goi cuon (summer rolls with pork and shrimp) are a little lackluster and puny, but that's not to say they weren't still delicious.  Comes with a hoisin/peanut sauce.  On a side note, Jeremy Lin eats here!  Staff/owner was really nice.  Would definitely come back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Although the place does not seem too clean, the food is always good and the servers are always super nice! We love their papaya salad and pho.  In our opinion, the pho has the best flavor in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"My first every pho experience! Still the same old place. I would give it Ok for food, service and pricing."}
{"text":"First time trying pho and the staff there helped me pick out the flank steak pho. It was a great recommendation. They Ben gave me suggestions on what to add with the various condiments.   The food itself was delicious. Huge portion of noodles and the steak was on point. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Love it...best Pho in the 704 Queen City, you must go here. Best food and service....thanks"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see my old go-to joint  Pho Hoa had changed names.  I was apprehensive in going but gave it the benefit of the doubt.   New menus = higher prices.  Broth was bland and I didn't even finish my noodles.  Would never go again."}
{"text":"Food is served fast. You can sit anywhere you please. Prices are reasonable. Staff are really friendly. No fan fare Vietnamese resto. If you want a quick fix and you're around the area and don't wanna bother driving anywhere else then yea- go here. But I've had way better Vietnamese food in Scarborough like Pho Vietnam or Pho 88 so if you can drive to one of those spots!"}
{"text":"This is a super simple, unassuming Vietnamese place on the western end of Central Ave. I never would have found it were it not for the friend who brought me here. It's the perfect lunch or takeout spot.   Their menu is not QUITE the same as what you find online - it's more extensive. Which was good news for me as a vegetarian, because their tofu/non-meat options weren't immediately clear when I looked online. Rest assured, most meals can be made with tofu.  I got pho and it was perfect. TONS of green vegetables and noodles with a side of bean sprouts and however much sauce and hot sauce your heart desires. Really hit the spot for a chilly day!"}
{"text":"Oh, Pho Hoa... how I love thee.  Pho is something I crave uncontrollably sometimes, and this little place is close to my house, affordable, friendly and delicious.   Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING ! My husband and I are returning customers  !!!! I absolutely ADORE their avocado shake with freshly made tapioca pearl .... I usually have their Chicken Pho, the broth has this amazing taste and all the veggies and herbs served with it is always very fresh! My husband like to eat their more spicy pho with tripe, he loves it as well.  Highly recommend this place, we're addicted !"}
{"text":"I went there last week. The service is horrible. If you ask for anything it takes ages to get there. I asked for chilly oil handed me ghost peppers. I almost had a heart burn. Didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Hands down the best. Friendly staff, great food, awesome atmosphere...if you dont try this place you are definitely missing out. Also ask for Terri's hot sauce!"}
{"text":"By far the best pho place in Charlotte. The flavor is incredible and the portions are very very generous. You'll always have plenty to take home. If you like spicy food make sure to ask for the house made chili sauce. One of the few places in Charlotte that has glass noodles and extra noodles is always an option! The summer rolls are very good as is the quail appetizer."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first entering an empty restaurant on a Sunday night I ordered the special pho, pork and chicken rice and pork bun Poor ingredients arrived for the pho with wilted basil and brown bean sprouts. The pho itself was sub par and to my ignorant self just the beginning of it The next thing that arrived was my drink, red bean ice and to my horror it came in a bubble tea take out cup  The drink itself was overlly sweet and large chunks of ice existed I waited 15 min for the next dishes to arrive and they both were worse than the pho  Burnt meat and spring rolls on both dishes....... I waited 15 minutes just for a bad taste in my mouth.....  In the end 0 stars for the food and service but I'll give them 1 star for having free wifi :P"}
{"text":"The pho is alright.  The portion of noodle that I got in my pho was small.  I still prefer the pho at Truc at the Asian Corner Mall location.  I love the Laos style papaya salad but the 3rd time I order the dish it was disappointing.  The sauce was different.  Maybe they ran out of their regular/original sauce or the papaya salad was not made by the usual individual.  The most disappointing part was that I was raving about how good the papaya salad was to my people. When they finally got to taste the papaya salad from Pho Hoa, they didn't even get to taste the papaya salad that I was raving about.  I wish that they would have just told me that they were out of the main ingredient and I would have been fine with that response. If their sauce for the salad changed than I completely understand.  PRO: the papaya salad  CON: Lack of integrity."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good Pho you should come here! It is delicious! The Pho Dac Biet was amazing and even the simple Pho Ga!  Come here if you are looking for some great soup! The host was so funny too!  Overall a fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"Great, quick service. Was recommended to go to Pho Hoa from a Vietnamese friend who works in Charlotte, as I was visiting from out of town. The pho was good for being in an area where Vietnamese food is not too popular (I am from Northern Virginia/DC where the Vietnamese community is very large). There was a good amount of meat and pho noodles in a small bowl, which I thought was bigger than an average small pho bowl (but I might be wrong). The broth was super hot when our order came out and definitely satisfied my pho craving, as I am from Blacksburg, Virginia (Virginia Tech) where we don't have any pho places locally. Overall, a really great experience!"}
{"text":"I go here on a daily the manager is always a charmer. Everything is good here ! I recommend it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Love to go to this place. Large servings, tried the meatball pho, that's my new favorite. Put the heat to your meal to open sinuses!  See ya soon."}
{"text":"Pho Hoa is the best pho I have had, hands down.  They take their pho to a health level with adding green vegatables..a little snow peas, broccoli,  celery..etc.  The chicken was moist and tender and sliced in thin layers and the broth was absolutely delicious.  I live in northern Virginia and I am on the hunt to locate a similar one up here.  This is a must Go To resturant!!"}
{"text":"Omg where do I start! My sister introduced this restaurant to me and I'm glad she did. I literally come here all the time. My son has been coming here since he was about two years old which is now 4 and he seriously finishes his bowl of soup. He knows his order and cannot forget to order his bubba tea. This is the only place I will come to eat pho."}
{"text":"9.50 for a big piping hot bowl of pho? I'll take it! Although in a somewhat off putting strip mall, like many of the gems on Central, I was pleasantly surprised. Their egg rolls are delish, obviously homemade, but skinny. The pho we ordered came out very quickly. The meatballs in my boyfriend's bowl were steamed not grilled though and had the texture of tofu. We were not fans. Service was okay, but it took forever to get a check at the end of our meal. I would come back on a cold rainy day."}
{"text":"Vermicelli bowls are great. Pho of course is phenomenal. If you like spicy ask for the really really spicy chili sauce. The fish tank is awesome too. Great people. I'm here at least once a week."}
{"text":"A little surprised I hadn't reviewed Pho Hoa in the first place, but had the pleasure of having Pho for dinner last night. Learned a few new things this time 'round and couldn't be happier.   Here's a few fun facts:   Apparently, this place is a chain with several other locations with the Pho Hoa branding, but each location retains creative control over menu items, development, etc.   The divider in the men's room is an old kitchen galley door. Rad.  Jalapenos are freaking hot.  Sriracha is an institution.   Loved the Pho Thai. Some of the most \"buttery\" broth I've had to date. Broths vary from restaurant to restaurant and Pho Hoa makes the short list for me. The summer rolls are top notch, too.   Plenty of boba options, too. I'm a large proponent of the avocado variety."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom while we were on our Ikea trip in Charlotte. We were seated very quickly, as there weren't many people, and within five minutes of ordering, we both had steaming bowls of pho in front of us. The broth was clear and flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. They gave us a lot of meat (definitely your money's worth!) and I particularly enjoyed the steak and fatty brisket. My mom thought her broth was on the salty side, however, and she didn't finish all her meat because it was too much. This place has reasonable prices for a nice bowl of pho that really hits the spot, and when you come, be sure to add the basil (check to make sure it's fresh first though), bean sprouts, lime, cilantro, jalapenos for a nice kick, fish sauce, and sriracha to your soup. It really brings out the flavor. I'd definitely come again, as there are no good pho places in Chapel Hill."}
{"text":"Awesome pho.  From DC so i was skeptical that charlotte would have decent pho.but damn get the number 20"}
{"text":"Not authentic pho ga, spring rolls were very good but pho was nothing special and has a lot of non traditional vegetable ingredients that were frozen/canned"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian pho bursting with veggies. The bubble tea is great too! This has become a regular place that my partner and I hit up for vegetarian pho, and we are always satisfied. Awesome portion sizes too. I have a big appetite and sometimes I can't finish my pho."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Ask for the homemade extra spicy hot sauce!!    I would recommend having an extra glass of water, it has 6 different types of hot peppers to include Ghost! Peppers.  Bubble tea is amazing too, any kind!"}
{"text":"Good pho. Expensive price. My Vietnamese friends have been there before and claimed that the business has definitely increased their prices."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese so I am extremely picky with Pho. Of course you need the star anise, cinnamon, beef bone broth etc... to make your pho broth rich in flavor. Take my word for it, this has to be the best place to get Pho. Honestly, it is very hard to serve rich in flavor pho at a restaurant because the general nature of the dish takes so long to make. For me, nothing beats homemade pho, but I have been here since I was a kid and I love it. You will know when there is a not so good bowl of pho, the broth would not be rich in flavor and you will be able to taste \"water\". Their menu has stayed the same since I first came here as a child and there are many wonderful options to get. Hu Tieu Xao (stir fry) and any of the Com Tam (broken rice) dishes are phenomenal. The sauce is the most important part and they manage to hit it every time.   The place could be a little cleaner(reason for 4 stars), but the preservation of the restaurant decor and everything else has been the same for many many years. The family who owns this restaurant is extremely nice and welcoming and my review is not in any way biased because my family knows them. The food comes out fast and I have not had one bad experience. I have yet to find any other Pho restaurant who can manage to bring a good degree of richness to their broth... so check it out!"}
{"text":"Sticky utensils. Kid meal pho was okay but the Bun Bò Hue and Bun Rieu in the Special Menu were worst. Cloudy and bubbly soups in both bowls, meats tasted weird. Lesson learned, NEVER try something else at a Pho Chain-Restaurant. Both myself and the husband had a couple tummy-cleansing time already. ;(  Never return."}
{"text":"First experience was great been going weekly clean environment and good service check them out you will not regret it"}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in Charlotte thus far! Broth is savory and fragrant and the meats are fresh! It's also less than 10 minutes away from Uptown by car. Service was really quick and received my pho within a few minutes from ordering. I'll definitely be back next week"}
{"text":"My chicken pho was delish. The fried rice was not so great. Next time I'll pass on the rice and go straight to the soup!"}
{"text":"Living in the South it's hard to find a good pho restaurant. I definitely got spoiled growing up in California. We came here on a Sunday morning for brunch and were seated right away. I decided to get the traditional beef noodle pho and also got an avocado shake with boba. I love avocado shakes and it has been awhile since I had one, so it was given that I had to order it. My husband and I shared a plate of spring rolls which I enjoyed.  Our dishes came out in a timely manner and they provided plenty of veggies to put in our pho. Everything was tasty! If you are looking for a non traditional breakfast spot, you should come here especially after a night of partying."}
{"text":"Yummy Pho with chicken.   I'm a rookie with this cuisine so I'll leave it to the experts to battle it out.   Fast service,  easy parking,  good prices.   They even explained to me how to prepare it at my table.   Good experience."}
{"text":"I come here far too often to rate this place a mere 4 stars, so I'm updating my review to 5. Without a doubt, this is the best Pho in town.  As much as I love Lang Van, I don't go there for the pho anymore, which is wildly inconsistent. Pho Hoa rendition is spot on every time.  But can a mere bowl of soup be 5 stars? Well this is not just a bowl of tasty noodle soup, this is the best breakfast in town! Pho Hoa opens everyday at 8:30, and on any given Sunday you will find me here. I wish Charlotte had more international options for breakfast. Google \"50 of the World's Best Breakfasts from Around The World\" for an interesting illustrated look at what other people eat for their morning meal.  Break out of your breakfast rut and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last Friday, and I'm absolutely shocked that that I hadn't been here earlier.  Very good pho and a great vibe at this place.  I got the Number 5 Pho, which consists of two kinds of beef.  Very fresh thai basil, cilantro and jalapenos are served separately.  It is easy to bring large groups here (which we did), the service was extremely friendly, and they have a number of veggie dishes (even veggie pho) for who swing that way.  Big ups to Pho Hoa!!"}
{"text":"At Pho Hong Ha today, craving for some Vietnamese food! It used to be called \"Pho Hoa\" but has now changed to \"Pho Hong Ha\".  They sell the typical Pho, other noodles, rice dishes but I usually come for the vermicelli bowls! Because their grilled pork here is the bombbbbbbbb!  Tea is naturally provided in an Asian restaurant. In Pho Hong Ha, tissues and utensils are all stacked up at the side of the table and I usually like to clean my utensils with the hot tea before I use them because who knows how long they've been there? Just a tip!  Tried the Strawberry slush with tapioca bubble tea here, and it's not bad. You can taste the strawberry bits with each sip. The tapioca balls aren't as chewy as I'd like it to be, so it depends on preference.  Our food came pretty fast, all of us ordered vermicelli bowls - pretty easy job for the chef if you ask me. Hahaha.  Most of the others ordered #85, which was Grilled Pork and Spring roll. Vermicelli bowls are vermicelli noodles with tons of vegetables like lettuce, cucumbers, carrots and raddish with the type of meat which was grilled pork and spring roll, sprinkled with crunchy peanut bits and green onion!  Personally, I don't like the spring roll here as it was more Chinese-style than Vietnamese-style, so I got #81 instead, which was Grilled Prawn with Pork to try for the first time. And I didn't necessarily like this option either because the prawns were fried with their shells on - and I'm a bit wary of eating prawns with shells.. I usually peel them off. So when I did try to peel off the skin, well, 1) it was hard to peel it, and 2) there wasn't much meat from the prawn left...  Each vermicelli bowl came with a side bowl of soup and a bowl of fish sauce which you'd drizzle all over your vermicelli bowl so it wouldn't get too dry while eating your noodles.   Service here was alright and we went at a quiet time so we were easily noticed by the waiter. The space is huge so you'd definitely get a seat when you come. The wait for food is never unreasonable. Although I'd have to say, parking here is really limited and is pretty tight so that'd be a negative.  I have had the Pho here before but don't enjoy it quite as much mainly because they don't have the type of chili oil that I like, and they use a different type of noodles. The noodles aren't a big thing, like I'd still eat it. It just feels plain to eat without my usual chili oil.. so I turn to the vermicelli bowls!  I really enjoy the vermicelli bowls because, like I said, the grilled pork here is sooo good!! There's just something about it that makes it so chewy and tender. Major yum!! Plus it usually comes with lots of veggies which makes the meal fresh and crunchy.  100% recommend the vermicelli bowls, so do get it when you're here!"}
{"text":"Best pho for Charlotte! Phos are authentic. Plenty of meat. Rice dishes are yummy and huge portions. Love the papaya salad (hot and spicy). I always order an extra pho and papaya salad to go since we live an hour away. The broth is just right! Prices are reasonable. You know it's good when you show up at 10 and the place is packed. Small parking lot."}
{"text":"Ill preface this review by saying I have never ordered pho at a restaurant before so I cant fairly say 'this is the best pho ever' but I certainly enjoyed it.  It had been a late, long Saturday night so come Sunday morning, when I had the 'feed me now' shakes and it was 10:30, I wanted something filling and fast. I did not want breakfast and brunch in Plaza Midwood really doesn't start until 1 (near where I live).  Its a chain, but no frills, plenty of different dishes and noodles and fast.  I got the number 1 pho with beef. Simple but complex broth and great, fresh bean sprouts, juicy limes and cilantro to add to it.  I will be back for sure. I would think the to-go size would be big enough for two since the bowl in the restaurant was quite generous."}
{"text":"Chain or not a chain? Both. If you order off the main menu it is part of a chain; however, the menu on the table is not chain and has vegetarian options.   I enjoyed the fresh taste of the ingredients. It came out very hot and tasted delicious. Each entree is big enough to share; however, if you have a large appetite and want your own it will be enough. Rewarming the leftovers was not appealing to me due to the fishy smell. Eat it all while you are there so you don't encounter this issue.   You'll need to go to the door to pay...they are a bit hands off when it comes to bill time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My go to Pho place! It may be because it's delicious, it may be because it's super close to my home... Either way I rate them high! Great customer service and I am never disappointed with the quality! I get my Pho to go all the time and they give you all the bells and whistles so you can customize your Pho at home! I'm addicted to Pho and I find this to be the best price around town!!"}
{"text":"I was dying from the plague or a cold or something and then came Pho Hoa to the rescue. I don't have Pho often but I'm going to make it a staple in my diet during the upcoming colder months. Everything Pho Hoa serves up is extremely delicious. The seasoning and flavor is on point. The portions are huge. A large bowl is easily 2 servings. Service is super friendly and the cashier and I shared some witty banter. He put extra effort to make sure I was engaged and welcomed. Prices are affordable, especially since you'll definitely have left overs. I love that I was able to pile on stuff to my bowl and added pretty much all the meats available. I came in and ordered take out and was on my way pretty quickly with a well packed bag of soupy goodness. I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Pho place in Charlotte. We eat Pho probably once a week every week for the past 15 years when introduced to it in DC. My boyfriend LOVES yellow crunchy fat. Most people don't know what that is or don't offer it. We both love fatty brisket as well. I usually get vegetarian with beef broth. I love veggies and we get extra meat in his so I steal a couple pieces:). I like my tofu  thin cut so it's a little more crispy. This place has chunks but still good. I like the veggies they use too. No baby corn (yuck) and no mushrooms!!! They have 2 really cute aquariums that my daughter loves.  The guys we see every time we come are pretty gangster and I LOOOVE that. They are very nice and always get excellent service. You can tell this is a family run place and they mean business! Well done family we will see you every week!"}
{"text":"The best place to get Pho in Charlotte. I'm a Boston transplant. There is a Pho Hoa in Dorchester MA. This is the same group of people. I honestly feel at home when I eat here, and that is the best feeling to have when you are dining out. My highest accolades."}
{"text":"Five stars.   We were a party of 10 and there was space for us immediately. I loved that there's a kid sized bowl of pho instead of having to divide a regular bowl for my kids. The  vermicelli bowl was flavorful and fresh as was the pho. The green tea boba was just what I needed. Overall, a great place for family dinner!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful.  Fast service, friendly owners and wait staff and the food is amazing.  I have been twice.  Once I got the Pho and the second time I ordered a vermicelli noodle bowl.  Both were absolutely delicious.  You get a lot for your money as well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the parking can be somewhat difficult, but it won't stop me from eating here.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pho was delicious and served in a huge portion. Perfect way to warm you on a cold day. In addition they went out of their way to give me a \"secret\" hot sauce they had in the kitchen after I told them I liked my Pho spicy. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"As a lover of vietnamese food and living fairly close to Pho Hoa, I'm a bit shocked it has taken me this long to venture in and try the food.    Pho Hoa is located in a small strip mall on Central Ave, just next door to the (now closed) Dim Sum.  When we walked in, we were seated immediately.  There were several bags of take-out waiting for pick up and the restaurant was about half full on a Monday night - all very good signs!  The walls are decorated with lots artificial flowers shining under fluorescent lighting.  Not great ambiance, but, that's not really why we were there :) .  At the tables, there were small menus underneath the glass - so that they are always visible and then larger menus with lots of photos.  The larger menu offers a variety of bun (vermicelli) and pho options, along with some spring roll appetizers.  I tried to order a glass of wine (offered on the under-the-glass menu, but not the larger menu), but was told they weren't serving alcohol today.  I'm unsure if they ever serve beer/wine, or just not on Mondays.    We ordered a seafood pho and a bbq pork bun (vermicelli).  They came out quickly - but, both were underwhelming and a bit bland.  The food was fine, but not exceptional.  I wanted to love it here, but the kitchen just didn't deliver the flavor punch that I expected.   Overall, I wouldn't not come here, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Steak and Brisket Pho! I get as my weekend recovery meal and always brings me back to feeling 100% Avocado Jackfruit Bubble Tea is the best I've had not from powder either!"}
{"text":"Thank you for Yelp on this one!! I love plaza midwood but hadn't been down this far, it turns into a genuine Chinatown! Firstly the staff gets a 5 as well, so happy, friendly and eager to help you find exactly the dish for you. We love pho but I've never ever, even in NY Chinatown seen so many options! I love it! I wanted to try something else and he suggested the chicken pho, and wow!!! I loved the pea pods, cabbage, carrots and broccoli all still crispy, along with the regular awesome rice noodles and great toppings. The kids had all kinds of non conventional things in their pho and loved them all! (I was nervous on the tendon, tripe etc). Wonderful food, great service and fantastic prices ($8.95!) along with wonderful other options of vermicelli bowls and rice bowls.. Yay! Our new favorite for pho hands down :)"}
{"text":"Took 10 of my friends here and everyone loved it! First time fav is a #2 pho bowl. I like to get one with meatballs, steak, and lean brisket. A few others got the Vietnamese dishes, they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Uh this place gave me a natural food high! I felt my endorphins releasing and I felt so happy after my meal. Haha. The pho was good and rich! They served our dishes out pretty fast which was real nice! I would recommend everyone to come here if you want some AUTHENTIC food, and if you want to support your local small family buisness! I'll make sure to come here everytime I stop to North Carolina ! This place is YUM !"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious.  I would eat here daily if I could.  The service is great and if you aren't sure what to eat, the waiters are remarkably helpful and will give you suggestions."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a no-star then I would. Completely disgusted with this restaurant. Went here for lunch. It smelled so bad in here like a sewage drain. The tea tasted like rotten water and had no taste of tea. The tea pot was rusted inside when I opened it. I ordered the vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring roll. The sauce was bland, the soup was bland, the lettuce was at the stage where it was a day before spoiling and what's worse is that I chewed into a raw piece of chicken, and instantly puked in the restroom. The lady was so close to giving me attitude when I told her my chicken was raw. I told her I could get sick from this and she's like \"well what do you want me to do\". Well obviously I want her to take it off the bill!! There was not one thing that was good about the dish!! I am so disgusted right now, my stomach feels like it's flipped inside out. Ugh! NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in the pho I received; it was rather bland. I had to add various spices and sauces to give it some depth of flavor. It was a good portion of broth and meat! I just wish their was more love in that bowl."}
{"text":"I wanted to get crushed by a snake. Should have gone to Pho Boa.  On the one hand I really like this restaurant and I was about to stop here for the third time this past Thanksgiving. On the other hand they told me they would be open on Thanksgiving and when I arrived they were open but were in the process of cleaning up and told me that they were closed and they couldn't serve me. Even though people were ordering and having their food still brought to the table. And all I wanted was a take out sandwich. Oh well. that's the reason for the deducted star but honestly it was going to be somewhere between 4 and 5 anyway."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm...this is a tough review to do. Maybe it's the paying $9+ for a bowl of soup that gets me, but I just don't get the hype surrounding pho. That being said, Pho Hoa does a good job compared to other pho places that I have been to. The service is friendly and quick, and the food tastes good. If you like pho, you will like Pho Hoa. Not sure what else to say since it really is just soup with noodles and meat.  One complaint that I have and the reason for four stars is that they have a minimum charge required for credit card use that they conveniently put just above the price of one order of pho. Stop being cheap and greedy, and start accepting credit cards for all charges."}
{"text":"Pho Hoa is a link in a worldwide pho chain that I've been familiar with for two decades.  A location in Atlanta back in the day was slick and modern, but this one comes off as a homey, warm mom-and-pop pho shop.    We had Christmas Eve dinner here, the only time we took a break from my brother's excellent home-cooking over the holiday.  This was definitely better than average pho, at least for those of us who live in the 98 percent of this country that does not have heavy Vietnamese popluations:  rich, silky, complex broth; properly prepared meats; and plenty of fresh condiments.  Big goi cuon were a little bland, though, lacking in fresh herbs, but the accompanying peanut sauce was bold enough.  Good soda chanh, although $4 seems a little steep.  Service was pleaseant and efficient.  Appropriately interesting music for a pho restaurant--instrumentals that sounded like a bizarre cross between traditional Vietnamese and Hollywood western movie music.  Overall, a good one."}
{"text":"I admit their Pho and Vermicelli dishes are good, but I've tried to eat here twice in the past month at 8:15p and 8:30p (somewhat late I know, but it's post-gym), and they wouldn't serve me either time. Said they were shut down, with the entire dining area packed. Sign says 9p, but they seem to shut it down about an hour before. Unfortunate, and they seemed to have cared less."}
{"text":"Very consistent and solid pho place. As with any noodle soup, the broth makes or breaks the dish. The broth here is very balanced; it has good flavor without feeling overly salty or fatty. I always go for the \"adventurous\" combination pho for the tripe and tendon."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Had no complaints. Wish I could have tried a shake but I was in a hurry. Only thing that I'd like to point out is that the sanitation score was a 90, so if you're picky about that don't go I guess. Nice spot on Central. Located in a small shopping center full of oriental joints."}
{"text":"I drifted in here on a rainy day, this a nice cool spot with healthy tasty options. I tried the Vegetable Pho which was very good, it came with nice chunks of tofu, noodles, vegetables, and bean sprouts, its was simple yet tasty and very filling. On the downside it seemed to take quite a while for my soup to arrive. The people that run the restaurant are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is our go to Friday night dinner spot. We really like going out on Fridays but we try to find places that meet two major needs: 1. Doesn't bust the budget 2. Has delicious gluten free options  Pho Hoa meets both needs with spectacular fashion. I'll shamelessly admit that we have literally eaten here 3 Fridays in a row. It's hard to beat the friendly and fast service, high quality food, and low price point.  Lately we've been letting the staff pick our meals for us. We tell them the kind of thing we are (or aren't) in the mood for, and they always bring out something spectacular. We also have been going often enough that they let us taste test the new dishes they're trying out for themselves. You really get the feeling that this is a family restaurant, and they're happy to welcome in smiling regulars as part of the family."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time and good god almighty, I could eat pho all day, everyday. After a staggering 11 hours in the car returning home from upstate NY, along with a weekend full of carb induced hangovers, a pipping hot bowl of pho was just what my tummy ordered. Fresh veggies, herbs and just the right amount of sriracha and I was ready to get my stomach back on track for the week.   We ordered the summer spring rolls to start and the chicken pho for my entree. The spring rolls were on point with the fresh ingredients and creamy peanut dipping sauce. The chicken pho was just as good as the last time I came. The enormous bowl of noodle, chicken and broth goodness had nothing on me though. I finished just shy of becoming a fish and floating away.   Service is always pleasant and quick, with the food arriving in minutes of ordering. Favorite part of the scenery, in the winter there's a lovely kumquat tree near the register (if you've never experienced a kumquat, you're missing out on natures very own sweet tart), huge tank fully of funny looking fish and in the very center of the restaurant a community table that has more laughs than the joker."}
{"text":"One of the longest Pho place in Charlotte, they are consistently good!  They are by far the most traditional Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte when it comes to their ingredients and flavor. Try their papaya Salad.. made with tons of extreme spice, shrimp paste, and raw crabs.. even someone from Vietnam will say that's pretty potent stuff!  Their pho is consistently good not the best in Charlotte but good.  Their Ban Xeo is awesome with the nuoc nam but do not order on Sunday's because for some reason they will not.  My favorite is their Mi Quang and House fried rice.  Their Mi quang is greasy but its suppose to be greasy.. VERY flavorful of great seafood and pork flavors!  Their fried rice is awesome due to the mixed ingredients and the \"Smokey\" flavor of the hot wok it was cooked up in... perfect combination of rice and soup!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants out of the many that I've visited across the country. The pho is addicting. My personal favorite is the steak and brisket. Do yourself a favor and try the bubble tea. I'm obsessed with the frozen coconut bubble tea, but each flavor I've tried had been good. This is a chain, but the franchises are independently operated. This place knocks it out of the park on execution. The atmosphere isn't anything to wax poetic about,but the food is."}
{"text":"I've had pho many places and am very particular about food. This is hands down the best pho I've had in Charlotte. Easily. Great atmosphere and customer service. The owner was very personable and super friendly. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I'm a pretty big fan of Pho. But Pho Hoa is the first Vietnamese place that I had ever eaten at and this was way back when I was in kindergarten. And if I happen to be in the area (which isn't a lot nowadays) I do try and hit this place up. The decor has pretty much remained the same for the last 15 years. Same old tables. Same old chairs. Same old dirty bathroom.   That's probably why this place doesn't get 5 stars because the restaurant isn't exactly 5 star restaurant cleanliness. But the Pho. Ooh. So good. I like to get a couple spring rolls when I go to start things off and they come with this vinegar dipping sauce which is really good. For the Pho bowls, you can get them in different sizes and I always get the XL because it is HUGE! They have a lot of different dishes but please, if a place has Pho in its name, you don't go asking for a grilled cheese sandwich. You get the Pho. Well. I like mine with some beef balls, tripe, flank, tendon ... pretty much the works.  I like to add a ton of the hot sauce because I like my pho to have a nice kick to it.   They do have other vietnamese dishes but I really prefer to only get the pho."}
{"text":"We ordered a 2 large beef pho bowl. Service was quick and within 10 mins we got our soup. We have been her plenty times over the years ordering pho or plates. The quality soup is still the same, the beef flank was a bit chewy so I had to spit this piece out. If you compare it to the other pho in town, eh it's a three star."}
{"text":"One of the many few gem restaurants in the charlette area, and I mean very few that actually taste good and that is authentic! Their service is outstanding. The broth that comes in your pho is so rich in flavor that you can tell there is no short cuts like flavoring cubes. Just straight up bone simmering for hours. Everything on their menu is a must try(specially try the rice dac biet)! All in all. This place is a must try and really recommendable place.  #TeamFatAzz and #TeamFatAzzJr Approval guarantee"}
{"text":"THE VEGGIE PHO IS MY JAM! I come here several times per month to get my Pho fix. The folks that run the place are great and very helpful if you just ask.   If you want something a little sweet to finish off your meal, ask for an Avocado Bubble Smoothie. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, this is a great place for pho. I always get the same bowl so my rating of the food is based on that bowl (Pho Tai, Chin Nac - noodle soup with eye round steak and well-done brisket) and the perfectly decent summer rolls they make as well. However, I'm a big fan of iced coffee (you know the strong stuff with the sweetened condensed milk) and whatever coffee they're using tastes like crap. So they lose a star for that one."}
{"text":"Pho Hoa is ow of my favorite pho places in Charlotte. The food is so authentic and I love the customer service. They are always so busy yet friendly and very attentive towards their customers!"}
{"text":"Pho Hoa has the sweet lemonade juice stuff that I crave at these kinds of restaurants. I enjoyed the spring rolls and the cool French press-style coffee with the condensed milk.   The menu is a little difficult to understand, but there's pictures, so you can always just point.   I'm a fan of Pho, so it's hard to go wrong in this part of Central! I thought that it wasn't as yummy as Ben Thanh, and the bubble tea selection is less glorious, but it's good stuff, and the price isn't bad. The last time I was here, I was treating two friends who had helped me out with some yard work, and all three of our meals were around $30, and that includes tip."}
{"text":"This is the place to quick for a solid Vietnamese hit on your tastebuds. As I have been to Vietnam a few times before, I had to visit Pho Hoa to satisfy my crave. It had such a familiar taste to it that we went to Pho Hoa twice in our one week visit in Charlotte! We tried the Vermicelli bowls with spring rolls & grilled pork and, the Pho noodle soup with the tripe, fatty flank, flank and beef balls. The broth was full of beefy goodness and was fairly generous with the amount of meat. The vietnamese coffee was a little too sweet so I suggest not to mix in all the condense milk given but the coffee definitely did have that Vietnamese brew to it. The set up is casual and the service is simple, quirky and good.    **To all the homesick asians out there, this is a pretty good joint for you. Plus there's a well stocked asian grocer right round the corner."}
{"text":"That was some gooooood pho! My go to chilly weather food was very well done by Pho Hoa, and with good service too! Water was refilled frequently and we were checked on just as often. Had the Hot and Sour Seafood Pho, and it had tons of flavor. Summer rolls were super fresh and light, the wrapper wasn't at all dry, which is usually a sign of pre-made rolls that are left to sit out. Portions were grand and prices were good. Brought some friends for their first go at pho and they seemed to enjoy themselves (and the food) immensely. They have a beginners pho part of the menu which could be helpful for the uninitiated.   Interior isn't too much to look at, but who goes to a pho place for atmosphere anyway? Location is in a small plaza on Central Ave next to Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant, look out for the bright green neon sign."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a couple different Pho's, to go. I think that ordering to go was our big mistake.  When I picked up the food the restaurant was pretty busy and everything looked pretty good.  However, our broth was ice cold, and the meat was raw.  Maybe this is normal but I have ordered Pho carryout at a few other places and the broth has never been cold nor has the meat ever been raw.  I don't know what else to say about this place.  The flavor was there, which ultimately is why I'm giving it three stars.  Again, I'm chalking up my experience to ordering carryout.  If I go back I will eat in and see if it's any better."}
{"text":"The pho tour continues...this place is solid 4 stars. I just got the basic #1 (steak pho) and the meat was very good, broth was A+, good size portion, clean atmosphere and friendly wait staff. I wish there had been more veggies in the soup, but that's just a personal preference. This was dank and I will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"The soup has too much MSG, and the noodles were too soft and had weird texture."}
{"text":"When you look for this place, you're looking for the sign that says \"Golden Metropole\" in the little shopping strip next to Dim Sum on Central Ave.  I used to trek over to Lang Van all the time to get my dose of pho, but I'm starting to think that this place may be better.  The broth has a more interesting flavor, and my perception, at least lately, has been that the quality of meat used in the pho is better.  Pho Hoa is a franchise chain, but each one is a little different and this one seems to have a few specials and items that are not part of the standard franchise menu.  Their menu is no more unusual than any other Charlotte Vietnamese restaurant, but they do it right and they open at 9:00 a.m. so that you can have pho for breakfast traditional stylee."}
{"text":"What the pho?  No seriously...  How does this place have 4.5 stars?!?!  I can ask this because I'm Vietnamese.  I grew up eating authentic Vietnamese cuisine not only at home but at restaurants in Little Saigon in Orange County, CA -- where there is a heavy concentration of mouth-watering, satiating, authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  Oh, and I've had pho in Viet Nam in both Saigon and Hanoi as recently as a year ago.  Pho is my comfort food; you know, the food you grew up eating that just made your tummy feel safe and happy.  I dragged my boyfriend out of our warm home in the rain so that I could enjoy a nice, delicious, hot bowl of pho, my quintissential rainy-day food.  I got a hot bowl of pho alright, but it was NOT delicious.  Pho broth, done well, is very complex to make (which is why I completely shy away from the kitchen altogether) because it takes all day to marinate the bones and then add the subsequent layers of flavors to it (there's anise and other flavors).  So 3 stars, and honestly, I think that's a really generous rating for the experience I had given their: (1) unclean restaurant (2 stars); good service service (3.5 stars); canned pho broth (2 stars); extensive menu (3.5 stars).  Unclean restaurant.  Ok; so pho is kind of like good authentic Mexican food.  You know the place is good when you're going to a little hole in the wall.  However, hole in the wall doesn't have to mean unclean.  When we came on a Sunday evening, the restaurant wasn't very busy.  However, there were food and remnants of who knows what on the floor.  It is quite bewildering that the restaurant has a 97% or some very high cleanliness rating.  The servers were standing around so it wouldn't have killed them to pick up a broom.  Just saying...  It just makes a bad impression and is really unappetizing, in general.    Good service.  The servers were very attentive, prompt and friendly.  They are obviously accustomed to explaining the menu, which is broken down like a \"Vietnamese cuisine for dummies.\"  If you're a newbie, they really know how to ease in slowly to pop your Vietnamese food cherry.    Extensive menu.  They have an extensive menu, kind of like Cheesecake Factory but for Vietnamese cuisine.  I'm certain that there's a dish for everyone's palate, with the caveat that it's prepared correctly.  I didn't try anything other than the pho so I can't speak to the other dishes.  They have a pho for beginner's section where they break down each ingredient and you can add whatever you want.  Basically, all pho restaurants do this, but it's not spelled out in such a rudimentary way.    The best analogy I can give is if someone has never had a burger before, you're not going to give them a Western Bacon Cheeseburger or quarter pounder with chili cheese on it; you're going to give them a bun, a patty, some pickles, ketchup and mustard to ease them into it.  You can go to ANY burger joint and ask them to hold the onions or add extra pickles; they just don't lay all of the ingredients out like at Five Guys for you to pick and choose.  Pho Hoa is like Five Guys but like all burger joints who let you pick and choose your ingredients, all pho restaurants do the same.    If you're new, just try the chicken pho (I prefer the beef broth though) or the pho thai (which is just rare flank steak lightly cooked by the heat of the broth).  All my non-Vietnamese friends ease into pho by trying these basics (chicken pho or pho thai) and then slowly trying new ingredients.  Canned pho.  The pho I was served was completely lacking in the complexity I was speaking of earlier.  It tasted like a step up from Top Ramen, although Top Ramen is more flavorful.  The broth I got was very bland to the extent that I needed to add fish sauce to it just to give it a little more flavor.  It tasted like beef broth from a can -- you know how chicken broth tastes like straight from the can.  When I have to add fish sauce to my pho, that's an epic pho fail.    I did have the honeydew smoothie though; it was delicious.    Overall, I left feeling really disappointed in my first pho experience in Charlotte.  Yelp, you have failed me on this front.  Total bummer.  I definitely won't be returning and next time it rains, I'll have to drive farther to satiate my pho craving."}
{"text":"For a Vietnamese girl who grew up eating pho in Little Saigon, California, the beef pho here  just doesn't cut it.  It's not even up to par.  If you haven't had the best, then you may not be able to tell the difference.  The most important thing in a good pho is the broth.  The broth is the hardest and takes the longest to make.  The broth holds all the flavor; it makes or breaks the pho.  The rest are just additions to the bowl of broth.  Here, I don't know if it's because the broth is too watered down, or if the spices are off, but the broth is just not satisfying.  A good pho broth is made from boiling beef bones with plenty of marrow for hours with spices like cloves and star anise.  Pho is supposed to be a hearty meal in which the combination of protein, spices, and warmth  puts you into a slight narcotic trance. It calms your nerves and makes you want to chill the rest of the day. It is the ultimate comfort food.  However, the beef pho at this restaurant was not hearty enough and certainly did not hit the spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. As my best friend said \"The food has all the right seasonings without being too spicy\". I just love how I can taste all the different flavors. My sisters always get the Papaya Salad, I love the veggie or chicken Pho. Especially when fighting a cold!"}
{"text":"Good thing I didn't review after my first visit...this time they took my order quickly (last time I was forgotten, apparently) and I barely  had time to read a few pages of a book on my phone.  Stuck with my usual pho tai--surprisingly good broth. Hearty, beefy, subtle, and the noodles were just right. The meat was a bit thicker than I prefer. The limes were juicy, but the sprouts and basil appeared to have been in a skirmish and both lost. Bruised and limp, they did their inadequate best.  I do wish pho places would give an option for different bowl sizes.   Vietnam Grille and Lang Van have more aesthetically pleasing interiors. Lang Van has a selection of wines. Both have attentive staff.   I should mention that I went to Pho Hoa yesterday only because Lang Van turned out to be closed on Mondays (which I never saw mentioned on their website)."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho! This is the type of authentic food, which includes all the sauces you need. They have the spiciest sauce that you could ever imagine for you spicy lovers. For those with a more milder palate,like myself, they still have very delicious milder flavors to add to your pho.  The service was excellent and they really have delicious tea beverages, which seemed more like milkshakes. Nevertheless they have tapioca with all sorts of different flavors. Definitely would recommend this restaurant to friends"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the Pho here. As someone who prefers to eat vegetarian, Pho places usually don't offer very good options. This place had all meat phos listed and a basic bowl that was just noodles and broth. I asked if I could have that, but with veggies. They asked if I minded if it had meat broth, and I said I didn't since I'm not that strict. They were very accommodating and served me a bowl full of noodles and veggies. It was enough soup for 2 meals.  Service was a bit slow because there were only 3 workers and a ton of take-out orders, so it took a pretty long while to get our check. That being said, they were working hard and very very kind about it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my daughter. She had the chicken pho and I had spring rolls. Place is cozy family atmosphere. Food was good and definitely will visit again"}
{"text":"Great Pho, hidden off the beaten path little distance down on Central. The broth was perfectly seasoned and and hearty, plenty of sliced steak and a multitude of options to build your own pho if you choose. They even have kid pho, with the noodle already cut up for them! Our 3yo was excited about that."}
{"text":"Took a few friends here for their first Vietnamese food experience. We all had the basic pho (one fri3nd got the chicken pho). Overall they really enjoyed the food.  It is an old, famil owned restaurant and the atmosphere reflects that.  The pho was great but the spring rolls (rice paper, not fried) with the peanut sauce was not that great. They had large pieces of mint in the rolls that were just overwhelming. They lack other flavor as well.  But still a recommendation for relatively cheap but good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Pho Hong Ha - Vietnamese restaurant run by Mandarin. From the outside I thought it would be a small restaurant but its surprisingly very open and large inside with many seats.   Got a extra large beef and tripe pho at $9.99 - it was pretty big I guess. There is a decent amount of beef and tripe. I wish the beef was more rare but it was fully cooked when arrived.   Deep fried spring roll $3.99 - it didn't look very appetizing at first glance but it was really crispy and tasted great.  Iced milk tea $3.69 - It tasted good but was more of a warm milk tea.  Overall, a decent Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new Vietnamese restaurant in the area and many friends recommended this place. This is where we discovered Mi Quang!!! Never had it in my life and it was life changing! The owner highly recommended it and it's not even on their menu. It was so well balanced. It's a little sweet and a little spicy with both seafood and meat! That's usually weird but it works so well. Even the side dish of garnishes are different than pho. The sesame rices cakes on the side are a great touch as well. My wife has the vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and BBQ beef but we've had better else where. Fast service and very clean inside. Can't wait to try their other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I only come here (it's a far drive!) for the papaya salad. It's so bomb! The rest of the foods/pho are mediocre. Last time I ordered Pho Ga, I think they either ran out of chicken or threw on some random meats on there. Was kinda sketchy. Didn't even taste like Pho ga lol. I was trying to be healthy and order Pho Ga, should of stuck with regular Pho seeing that it's not a popular dish here since the meats seem like it came from a wings or thighs. There were definitely no chicken breasts (white meat) there!  Then when I do ordered the Pho Dac Biet, they give you so little noodles. The meatballs look like it's been cut 10 times into small pieces from one meatball.   BUT the papaya salad, gets me salivating. Everyone knows this is the place to get your papaya salad. It's authentic. Loves it!"}
{"text":"Best vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. Try their bubble tea if you haven't! Would always recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling great due to feeling too good the night before so I was in no mood to put any effort forth for dinner.  I just wanted to order something and have it delivered but than I remembered that I am house & dog sitting and they act like wild beasts when the doorbell rings. So, I consulted my bf (yelp) for some help... after figuring out my options in a mile radius I decided to try Pho Hoa  Good decision!  This is exactly what I needed.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and explained what my veg options were.   I was in, out and back to the pad in under 15 minutes.   This was my first experience with vietnamese food but now I'm hooked.  I got soup with vegetables and tofu.  The tofu was baked and soaked up the flavorful broth but didn't get too soggy. It came with a bunch of fresh herds like cilantro, mint, and thai basil as well as jalapeno and lime slices.  Being a first timer I wasn't exactly sure how to assembly it but it's pretty much common sense.  Put the noodles, veggies, sprouts, herbs, and tofu in a bowl and pour the broth over top.  I know that sounds boring but it was delicious! Granted I added the hoison sauce they included and some sriracha I found in the fridge but I tried the broth on it's own to try to figure out if it was vegetable of miso based and although I still don't know I can tell you that its yummy.  After eating about 1/3 of the portion size my tummy feels happy.  Thank you Pho Hoa Restaurant for being the best part of my day!"}
{"text":"We got the pho with everything in it. Great prices $9.** for regular and $10.99 for large. Tastes amazing, a regular is big. We also got the spring rolls 2 for $4.50."}
{"text":"The amount of times I said \"Yeah, I'm so totally a fan of here\" while sitting in here waiting for food was kind of ridiculous.  Vegetarian options, a variety of Vietnamese cuisine, an awesome family of staff people, and wicked relaxed.  Oh! And bubble tea. Bubble tea is fantastic.  I'm having a hard time putting words to the overall feeling of why I really, really like here. The vegetarian soup is exactly what I'd expect, the spring rolls are also up to my expectations, and the bubble tea is run-of-the-mill (at least for if I was back in NY). I guess the atmosphere and the people have me rantin and ravin about this place. Definitely, definitely check it out. You'll see."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Pho...this place is consistent and does it right! Don't let the exterior fool you as it is a little rundown. It is located on Central Avenue in a shopping center next to a gas station. The service is great and the food is always good."}
{"text":"The Pho is solid but I've moved on to the Bun Bo Hue, which is incredible. I would post a picture of it but I'm more interested in enjoying it than photographing it. The quail is also delicious and great to share. If you're a chili head, they have a special chili paste that will burn your head right off your shoulders. The folks who run Pho Hoa are really great people and they are always happy to help you choose an entree if you're not familiar with the cuisine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good Pho spot.  Very solid service and atmosphere.  I got the steak and meatball pho with the spring rolls as an app.  Both were delicious.   Menu is cool because it makes it easy to order for first timers!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"This place was good. Nothing fancy, but variety of options on the menu, even for vegetarians. The tea was delicious and servers were very friendly. Food came out fast. One thing that I do wish is for more flavor/spice. I felt mine was a little bland but I would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Whenever craving for some yummy pho in a cozy environment, this is the place. Every dish is on point. The bubble tea is the best in the city. Whatever flavor you choose, it's guaranteed to be delicious. They also have other flavors that is not on the bubble tea menu so be sure to ask. They offer tapioca pearls or jelly. Flavors can be mixed up. My favorite currently is coconut mixed with pineapple to create a piña colada flavor. :)  Papaya salad is perfect Laos recipe. It contains crushed peanuts so make sure to request none if you have allergies. It also contains crab paste. Great choices of appetizers as well as an excellent vegetarian menu!   Ever since moving up to Charlotte about 5 yrs ago. I've came here as well as tried other pho locations around Charlotte and the triad area but none can compare. My husband, daughters and I are somewhat usuals here and that's because their food are always good.   They seem to be the main place out of a certain few that will cater to your taste buds. However you like your pho, let them know. My husband current obsession is his usual pho ga with a side of bun bo hue broth. Strange. Perhaps but Pho Hoa is able to provide that preference while other joints scratch their heads and tell him it isn't possible.    They treat you like family and are always welcoming you in with a smile.   Do give them a try if you have never been. It will make you change your favorite pho/bubble tea place for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Okay.. this was a surprise. Being that they are somewhat of a franchise I didn't expect much.   I've been here 4 times. Each time was good. My last visit the most impressive. I ordered their Bun Bo Hue and it was absolutely incredible! Not sure if it's consistently like that since I'm not from the area, but mine was awesome. It didn't have pork thigh but still, very happy! Garnishing was among the freshest I've seen outside of home cooking.   Pho was \"okay\" but Pho is one of those things that no matter how you made it, some will love it, some will not. Can't please everybody because everybody's got their own definition of a perfect pho. With that said, the garnishing for their Pho was top notch as well!   Their service was good, though a tad bit slow. It was almost 10 minutes until our order was taken. In certain restaurant, 10 minutes is nothing. But Vietnamese restaurants of this nature, 10 minutes is a long time. Wasn't just us.. I sat and observed other patrons that went though the same thing... sat around with the menus closed just looking around passing time waiting to be waited on... and they weren't even busy (this was late afternoon, so normal for a restaurant not to be busy).   Regardless, I think it's a solid place, and I will definitely come here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The best Pho I've had since being in CLT from ATL. I wish they had tea bubble tea not smoothies tho. I had the steak pho and husband had an adventurers pho. Also were nice enough to give us summer rolls with out shrimp! Worth the 30 min drive!"}
{"text":"At first, I was a bit sketched out by the entrance of the restaurant. One of the servers was smoking a e-hooka and then there were a bunch of guys standing outside with motorcycles parked by the restaurants chatting and looking all rugged. After going inside, the restaurant is actually pretty spacious, unlike most pho places on central ave, which are pretty cramped.   The server is decent, not overtly rude like a lot of pho places, she even came back to ask how the food was. This place never looks very packed to me, I drove by on multiple occasions.   You can substitute egg noodles for pho noodle for an extra 50 cent. The quality of the dishes here are decent. I'd say 4/5. Price wise, a bit higher than other pho places around."}
{"text":"This place has great pho. Visiting from New York,  I imagined that it would be hard to find authentic Vietnamese cuisine,  but it's not ture. This places hits it's target in every way.   Great food.  Fast service.  Causal dress.  Takes Visa and Mastercard but not Amex or Discover.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte ! Great service , clean, good atmosphere, and the food is always delicious!! Don't forget to get bubble tea for dessert!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this because I have been coming here for years and the past year has really been a disappointment. They do have OK Pho but its loaded with MSG, feel free to call and ask. I always get the vermicelli and tofu, the past 2 times I have ordered this, its been gross. Its like they are mixing two recipes, Chinese vegetable in the salad dish. Stick to the Pho if you go, just beware if you MSG allergies. Maybe I am spoiled by Lang but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore."}
{"text":"Pho here is savory and delicious, and the crispy rolls tasty. Vermicelli bowl was okay, very fresh. We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese spot in Charlotte. Very good food quality, clean and cozy environment, very friendly staff! I have brought my Vietnamese friends and they said that this place is a hidden treasure. Variety in menu, not overpriced at all, food portion is satisfying! Also try their bubble tea at the end of your meal, it's to die for c:"}
{"text":"Finally found the time to check this place out after hearing many good things about it.  Upon first glance, I wanted to get back in my car and speed away.  Interior is pretty basic and bare bone but the food!!!!!!  *JESUS*  Was amazing!  I love the amount of vegetables that came with the pho, great service, and a great price.  Might take the #1 spot on my pho spots in Charlotte list!"}
{"text":"I'm always suspicious of pho hoa because it's a chain and the ones in Palo Alto and SJ in the Bay are terrible. That being said, I don't think Pho Hoa tells their franchise operators how to make the food because the one in Philly and the one in Charlotte are pretty damn good.   I've had both the Banh Xeo (they give you 2 for some reason) and the pho dac biet and they were both solid. I've been told by trustworthy sources that this is the best pho in town and as someone who rarely orders pho anymore, I was pretty pleased."}
{"text":"awesome! very cool owners that truly have pride in their food, and aren't stingy with the spice!!!"}
{"text":"This is, to date, the best Pho in Charlotte that I have experienced.  Dare I say it is un - Pho - gettable? Double dog dare...  I drove almost thirty minutes to wrap my mouth around this Pho, and it was worth every mile. I read the Yelp reviews, of course, and also followed up with a coworker that lives nearby. Positive feedback indeed!  The service isn't anything to write home about, but it's not horrible either.  They'll take your drink order and bring your drinks. They'll take your food order and bring your food. Not much checking back. but it's okay. Everything worked out and the food was so delicious!  For beverage I ordered the iced coffee, it was unusual how it appeared at the table, but it was also tasty!  Are you Pho real?  Tip: You pay on your way out at the cashier."}
{"text":"This is the only place I go for the bun Bo hue and papaya salad. Service is always good. No complaints. Love the food."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in my diet and a special place in my heart. Service is always fast, attentive, and helpful. The pho is flavorful and piping hot - and is usually on your table within 5 minutes of ordering. Nothing is better on a cold day!  To-go is packaged separately (broth by itself in a container, and styrofoam box with noodles, meat of your choice, and the rest of the pho fixins) and is ready very quickly. Don't forget to squirt some sriracha into your broth!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Pho! Don't know what that is? Don't feel bad, I didn't either. It's basically a rice noodle soup.   I ordered the Pho steak. Thinly sliced steak, rice noodles, onions and broth in a fairly large sized bowl. You then have the option of adding your own seasonings. I added: jalapeños, cilantro, basil, fish oil, soy, sugar, hoisin sauce, sriracha and chili paste oil.   You can adjust the amount of each ingredient to suit your palette. Mix it all together, grab some chopsticks and a spoon and GO!   I will say my lips are absolutely on fire! Note to self: less sriracha and chili paste next time!   You're welcome."}
{"text":"It's Fall, y'all and that means pho weather. Well let's be honest, I think all weather is pho weather. You'll find me with a giant bowl when it's triple digit heat outside. And this is the closest place to my house to get my fix.  Pho Hoa Restaurant is a chain with dozens of restaurants around the world. I'll agree with Ben N. though, the store here in Charlotte has the feel of a mom-and-pop type pho place. My pho order is the exact same at every noodle place: meatballs as my only protein. Tripe, tendon, and all that jazz are just not my jam. I think the broth has great flavor here. The fresh rolls and fried spring rolls are both good. Bonus: they also have bomb ass bubble tea.  Two phos, an order of fresh rolls, an order of fried spring rolls, and two Cokes totaled up to be $32.45. Note: sodas come in cans, so if you're a refill kind of person... you have been warned. Service is always pretty prompt. I do a lot of take out orders and I'm always in and out quickly.  Is it the best in Charlotte? I'm not answering that question. I'll let you guys continue your debate over who wins in our pho scene."}
{"text":"There are two pho restaurants on Central Ave with the SAME NAME! One is Anh Hoa Pho while the other is Pho Hoa. I've already reviewed the former, this review is for the latter.   This place has been around forever. Situated right next to Dim Sum Chinese in a little run down strip with limited parking. I used to frequent this place when I lived in the area but this is my first time back in years.   The restaurant layout is the same and like most Asian restaurants, there's a fish tank by the register. The menu has been upgraded though. You're given a menu once seated however there is another menu of additional items placed between the table and glass cover.   I ordered Hu Tieu from the table menu which is stir fried glutinous rice noodles with seafood and veggies. Also tried their egg rolls, summer rolls and papaya salad.   Let's start with the papaya salad. With this being a Vietnamese pho restaurant, I was very surprised to see that they served Lao papaya salad. It's 100% authentic, right down to the baby salted crabs, Thai eggplants and a side of kapoun- rice noodles. The salad was a tad salty but mixed with kapoun, It was PERFECT! Just the right balance of spicy, sweet, sour and salt - the four main Lao flavors.   The egg rolls were basic but they serve It with nuoc mam (fish sauce,) a leaf of romaine and do chua  (pickled carrots and daikon, same that you'd find on a banh mi) The proper way to eat an egg roll is in a lettuce wrap. Tear off a chunk of egg roll, add some of the pickles and wrap It in a little romaine, dipped into the fish sauce. Most places use the lettuce leaf as a garnish and don't include the pickled veggies. This places gives you what you need to eat It the proper way. Love that!   The summer rolls were ok. It was boiled pork without shrimp and didn't include the fresh basil that I like. I wouldn't order It again.   The hu tieu was good but I've had better. The stir fried noodles in the dish were perfect. It was cooked on very high heat so I could taste the sear on the noodles which is my favorite part, along with the chewy texture that's a little sweet with sweet soy sauce. My only gripe about this dish is that the veggie and seafood toppings were a little bland and lacked a sauce.   Overall, this place is good. I gave four stars for their papaya salad and egg rolls. I'll def be back whenever I'm in the area but I'll only order those two menu items. Or maybe I'll try their pho - maybe."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Pho you can get your hands on, service is good. Friendly environment."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and the food was great! Going back as soon as I can"}
{"text":"I love this place for viet food! It's very authentic, and the family owners are great! My parents and I come here all the time to celebrate and to just enjoy a nice lunch. Stop by..,. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Positives: - opens very early: 830 - nice people - meat is cut well for pho tai  - Ice coffee is creamy and flavorful - fish sauce is good - good mix of toppings  Negatives - soup broth overly greasy - fresh rolls use shredded lettuce - too much onion, not enough noodle in soup"}
{"text":"I haven't found many pho places out in Charlotte but was glad to find this spot. It's pretty dang good. I had the Pho Tai and grubbed it down.  What I appreciate at pho places is when they portion it out perfectly.  In most pho places in LA, they tend to give you way too much and it is nice and all, but you miss out on the satisfaction of finishing off a bowl - I thought this amount was really good.  The service was just fine and the food was awesome. I hope to come back again soon.  Doesn't hurt that there's an Oriental Market nea  They must be servin' up some lamb too because I saw a RACK and a half.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Some reason I always end up here but I never really liked it as well.   In my opinion the soup lacks a lot of flavor, and the pho comes with a huge helping of noodles in flavorless soup so it's just like swallowing bundles of noodles.  Also I really enjoy salad rolls usually, and the ones here were expensive AND they tasted really bad..like it felt like chewing sand inside *shivers* I get goosebumps thinking about when I ate it :(.  Maybe the rice dishes are better."}
{"text":"Went to Pho Hoa again this week with some friends.  Had a chicken vermicelli bowl and had them bring out their homemade multi-pepper sauce.  It has Carolina Reaper, Scorpion, Ghost and other peppers.  Possibly the hottest fresh-made sauce I have ever had.  The food was outstanding as always, and the pepper sauce made it perfect.  Warning about that sauce if you are not someone that can take it.  :)"}
{"text":"I come here on Mondays when my beloved Lang Van is closed. They have really great Pho and awesome customer service.   Typically when I order here, I order to go because ugh Mondays, am I right?! I just wanna put on my jammies and eat my pho at home.   Whenever I arrive the order is always ready. I order typically order the pho chay or vegan tofu pho. They also do a good tofu summer roll and my mom loves the pho tai.   Whatever I get, I get it with bread. Their bread is really good Vietnamese baguette. Soft and chewy with a hint of sweetness. Very well done.   The pho itself if always piping hot when I arrive home but I typically nuke it to get that scalding pho temperature I love. (It's \"Devil Wears Prada\" sadistic...I know).   The flavor is phenomenal. I mean so flavorful you want to call back and say, \"Uh are you sure this is veggie broth?!\" It's unbelievable. Hit it with the hoisin-sriracha blend (beware: they put both in the same travel ramekin)  and your traditional Pho accompaniments and its heavenly. I'm salivating just thinking about it.   I know they are a \"chain\" but their pho and their service  are Mom-and-Pop/local good. The guy at the front counter is always super friendly and must be a standup comedian in his free time because he's HILARIOUS !   Definitely stop by this place a grab some delicious pho, they won't let you down. Even on a Monday when you're sick, in need of Pho and all the rest of the Vietnamese restaurants have forsaken you, they've got your back."}
{"text":"Omg, I LOVE this place! I always get delicious food and great service here... it's by far my favorite place for Vietnamese food. I haven't tried a ton of items on the menu simply because the ones I *have* tried are too delicious to give up! If I'm looking for something nice and warm, I go for the pho (chicken, brisket, steak - they're all great!), but if it's a scorching day outside, the chicken vermicelli bowl is my favorite choice."}
{"text":"Yay pho!  I was able to come here last Sunday and introduce a couple people to the world of pho, and one also to bubble tea. Of course, they are now both lovers of these things, because how could you not be? The bubble tea was sweeeeeet, as it should be, and the pho was delicious, with plenty of options for add-ins. I had the brisket pho, and although I didn't eat much of the meat, getting that kind makes the flavor, for sure. The ambiance, like several pho places I've been to, felt like someone's kitchen, and the service was very fast, although everyone there was definitely not interested in talking to us, except the man at the register, who was great. (In their defense, however, we were dressed like fools.) Would certainly come back!"}
{"text":"FAVORITE PHO IN CHARLOTTE! Have tried several pho spots in Charlotte and by far this is the best. Really affordable and authentic."}
{"text":"Yummmm!!! Found this place on yelp in my neighborhood, feeling sickly and needing some comfort food.    Ordered the steak+brisket pho to go-  the nice thing about this place is the way the menu is set up: pho for newbies, pho for experienced and also adventurous ones.  Super easy to understand what to get!   The broth was super flavorful, they were friendly, quick, and affordable.  Will be back ASAP. Thank you Pho Hoa!"}
{"text":"Food comes out really quick. Taste great. Recommend grilled prawn and pork vermicelli."}
{"text":"YUM!  My friend and coworker knows the owners of this place. We went here today for lunch and it was amazing. It was her idea: after her disappointing bun at Zen Fusion last week, she wanted to take us to get real vermicelli noodles at a real Vietnamese place.  We got there a bit before lunch so the place was really empty. Our waiter was super attentive and excellent. Service was great throughout our entire meal, and it looked like as the restaurant filled up, he was just as attentive to every table (not just because  I was with a VIP).  I got the vermicelli pasta with grilled pork and crispy pork spring rolls. IT WAS SO GOOD. It comes out at room temperature and then you dump these spices and fish sauce over it to make the sauce. They have a variety of hot sauces on the table for you to make it as spicy as you'd like. My friend requested this special habanero chili paste (which I could not use) but I smelled it and it was totally legit. I used the red chili paste, and was able to get my Bun just to the spicy level I like it.  The veggies were fresh (some cucumbers and bean sprouts) and the fresh basil was a perfect addition. The veggies and pork spring roll gave my noodles just the right amount of crunch. We got some fresh lime for our dishes as well.  We finished our meal with bubble tea. I am not a huge fan of bubble tea, but I have become a convert. I had the avocado bubble tea, and let me tell you, LIFE CHANGING. It is made with fresh avocado (sweetened up, of course) and it was delicious. I tried my friend's coconut bubble tea, and that was equally as delicious (but apparently made with powder according to the owner). Still really good.  The restaurant was full by the time we left. Obviously it is popular. And I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pho is delicious...it is a phenomenal comfort food.  This location is close to my house and pretty quick with take out orders.  I have never dined in.  The shop is clean and spacious.    The service was ok, not overly friendly staff from what I gather picking up my orders and paying for them.  The prices are a little high, which is normal for this cuisine at most places I have been.    The pho was good.  Nice flavor and spicy.  No complaints with the food ever."}
{"text":"I've got to bump this place to 4 *'s for a couple of reasons.  A) I'm obviously \"a fan\", as I've been coming here once a week for the past two months. Cheap + close to my house + Pho being the perfect winter food = yay.  B) Service is always sincere and chill, not to mention quick.  C) The crowd is a blast for peep watching. Preps on a Friday before hitting the clubs to wizened grampas, they draw a variety.  D) Their in house \"specials\" menu has all the classics, and their style of prep is different enough from other Viet places to be interesting. Tofu and vegetables over crispy eggs noodles is huge, smothered in an odd but satisfying house brown sauce. Bahn Xeo is decent, though greasy, but what do I care. I'm still ordering Pho 9 out of every 10 times."}
{"text":"Excellent pho everytime I come here. I always get the large #2 (Brisket and Steak) with extra jalepenos and put just a touch of their ghost/crazy hot sauce in the soup and it's always a great soup!  There's always lots of meat in the soup as well as lots of noodles and the broth is great also. The people that work there are very friendly and the prices are very reasonable especially when you consider how good the soup is. Been coming here for 2 years now when I'm in town and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Finally going to review Pho Hoa, although I have not had every single thing on the menu. First off, for those yelpers who want to complain about $9 for pho. Two US dollars will buy you a bowl of pho in Vietnam. This is not Vietnam, this is the US where people have to pay rent. You'd be surprised how much rents are even in places like Central Ave. These people are legit. Le, the owner, what can I say, beautiful person inside and out. And when discussing congee with daughter-in-law Terri, I expressed my apprehension of eating pig uteri, and she, actually being Thai and not Vietnamese, explained \"we eat everything, honey.\" I had to laugh. It is many Asian peoples' comfort food, and I have yet to try it here, but as far as everything else, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Just wish they were closer to the airport and served bigger glasses of wine. The best thing about Pho Hoa? They open at 8:30 in the A.M. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Not bad.. the place is clean and it is located in a small plaza.  I ordered pho and coffee, standard for me.  Their portion is pretty large.  the basil was really really fresh.  Overall I wouldn't say it is the best pho I have had, but I think it should be a good place for Charlotte.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Never knew there was a chain Vietnamese restaurant.  They are doing it well.  The menu is extensive and we loved the wraps and the goi couin (sp).  The service was quite good and he even told stories about food and beer in Vietnam.  We would definitely take this in again."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for GOOD and legit Pho. Traffic is always good/never a wait and you get that good independently owned customer service of those who value frequent customers."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pho is great and consistent. Be carefully with those condiments though, it can get really spicy really fast. The spring rolls are also great. They are always fast and get you seated quickly. I eat here about once a month."}
{"text":"This is singularly favorite place to eat on cold and/rainy days.  I never look at a menu because what I eat isn't on it!  It's a pork based broth without the five spice.  Egg noodle and extra pork knuckles.  Yum yum yum.  Run do not walk here if you want to warm up.  Ok, I even eat here in the summer.  Come any chance you get!"}
{"text":"If you want pho your way, this is the place. You can order it with any meat combination you like. Businesslike atmosphere, friendly service. Noodles and broth are not the best in town but good enough for a quick and convenient meal."}
{"text":"Turned off by the fact this place is a chain, the service or lack thereof, and by the quality of their ingredients. Came in on Saturday for a quick bite, not wanting to travel down independence to go to my usual Vietnamese spot.   The service started fine, quickly located my favorite dish on their menu and ordered promptly. Problem was I never saw my waitress again, she didn't even bring the bill. Had to get up and go to the front, which might be the system here, but as a newcomer that wasn't clear.   The food wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't amazing. If I am paying $10 for rice noodles and a few pieces of meat, I can get from the market for $2, I expect better flavor. I guess next time I'll take the time to drive down Independence for quality food."}
{"text":"My favorite pho restaurant. As a vegan, they take great care of me. The staff is always kind and cheerful.  The decor is simple and tasteful, but no extravagant features. It is very clean and comfortable.  Careful with the chili sauce. It's so good you'll want to eat in large amounts, but it is super hot.  I simply love this place."}
{"text":"I travel for work and go out for pho in every city I travel to. Found this restaurant on Yelp because of it's reviews and was extremely pleased with not only the food but the service. I got there right before close due to my late work schedule, and considering so, I was a little afraid that I'd be too late and the kitchen would be closed. They allowed me to sit and eat and enjoy my meal with no rush. Granted, I did not need a menu because I knew exactly what I wanted to order and did not want to be a pain and waste any time. I got the summer rolls and the pho tai. DELICIOUS! I LOVE extra cilantro in my pho and that came [standard] on the side along with my limes, jalapeños and sprouts. It was excellent! SO glad I took an uber 15 mins outside of the city to get to eat here! Thanks to the staff for their excellent and friendly service and to the cook(s)/chef for the excellent food!"}
{"text":"Really the best Pho in Charlotte, and I lived in San Francisco and the Bay area for 5 years. Also, they have locations there as well, which I'm pretty sure I've been to."}
{"text":"Pho Hoa is located in a shopping center a bit down Central where there's also an asian diamond store. So you know, you can order pho and jewelry all in one place. The inside is absolutely mom and pop - the guy at the cash register had been working there for 20 years so it's definitely a family business, regardless of the fact that they're part of a national chain. We were seated quickly and started off our meal with an order of the Summer Rolls (I don't care that it's winter, the mix of thai basil and shrimp will always lure me into ordering them). They were good!  Fresh ingredients makes this a super refreshing appetizer, and the peanut sauce served along with it complimented all flavors well. For our main meal, I ordered Pho with Steak and Meatballs and The Lady ordered Vegetarian Pho (ask for pho with vegetables). The broth that they use is insanely good, and if you look into their website, you'll see it's made from lean meats and not marrow, which makes it actually pretty dang healthy!  The service was especially slow for such an empty dining room, but it looked like there were 3 people to handle constant delivery/pickup orders as well as man the front desk, bus, and clean. It took a good 10 minutes for us to get the attention of somebody for a to-go box (and I ate the leftovers of the hefty dish today for lunch, just as good the day after.... *swoon*)  The prices are wonderful here. 2 phos and an order of spring rolls left my wallet only $22 lighter, which is an incredible price for 2 meals worth of food for 2 people. Definitely recommend trying out Pho Hoa!"}
{"text":"Pho Hoa Restaurant has been in this plaza for as long as I remember.. at least for over 15 years!  This used to be my favourite place for Pho 10 years ago but I have not been back since then because there are so many different choices for Pho nowadays in Scarborough.  The ownership for sure has been changed. Before it is runned by Vietnamese speaking people and now they are Mandarian speaking people.. haha I guess it reflect the change in the demograhic of Scarborough itself too!  The place is open and spacious and huge for a Pho restaurant. There are ample of seatings and I don't think it ever will be busy.   I order a small ($6.35) raw beef and tripes Pho. The bowel is not big but it is full of noodles (small here equal med somewhere). The broth is ok, but at least it is hot! The noodle is the dried type but it was prepared properly. The tripes is the best part of the order!! It is cut really thinly, thinner than the noodle itself! And so tasty too!!  I order the vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk ($3.54) I can tell you that it is strong! I am on a cafferine high for the whole day!  The services is fast and indifference.. but as long as I can get my food and have a quiet lunch I am not complaining.  No Lunch Specials!  They do accepts Visa and MC and Interact."}
{"text":"I lived my vegetable tofu pho. In town on business and feeling a bit under the weather and the soup hit the spot.   Dan had the stir fry it was meh.   Clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I wish that I had took some pictures. I ordered a large bowl of pho with flank, brisket, fatty flank, and tendon. The broth was the best broth that I have ever tasted and I have been around. The beef was fresh and sliced thin. The noodles were tender yet not too tender - everything was perfect. The staff here have a humorous side so come in with a good mind and good mood. I will return - this may become my go to spot for Pho."}
{"text":"Just delicious. My only gripe was that my stomach couldn't hold more.  Ordered the summer rolls and the Ph Tái, Bò Viên (soup w/meatballs & steak). Luckily everything is numbered and there are lots of pictures so making a fool of myself by trying to pronounce the menu items was optional. I didn't even really notice the menu on the table until after I'd ordered off the one handed to me, lots of great sounding items I'll have to try in the future.   The rolls arrived within 90 seconds of placing the order. I was very surprised and the dipping sauce was perfect. I'm often skeptical of sauces sprinkled with peanuts as I've found it means you're about to dip into pure peanut overkill, but the sauce was balanced really well. The rolls themselves were nice- crunchy/crisp insides and the paper wasn't the pre-made &sitting out rubbery mess I almost expected since they arrived so quickly.  About three bites into my roll, my pho arrives. A really nice balance of broth to filling ratio, lots of noodles, lots of reaaaaally long fatty pieces of steak that made me happy no one was sitting across the table watching me attempt to eat them, and was served with the plate of bean sprouts/basil/lime/hot peppers slices.   Sriracha was plentiful, water was filled as needed, and the restaurant itself was fairly quiet, though I felt like if I had arrived an hour earlier during the peak lunch time it would have been a different story. All of the service staff I interacted with was extremely friendly and I will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Expensive, loud noise. Ignorant staff. The quality of food is only average at best. Save your money and go across the street to Jun Jun or Taiwan noodle house. There has got to be better ways to spend your money."}
{"text":"nice people, nice pho.  It's all about the broth, though I've had some better, but its really good!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for Pho. I'd been a fan of Lang Van but this place is very consistent. The staff is very friendly and I love that. I keep hearing everyone talk about the bubble tea so next time I will definitely try. I only gave 4 stars because I wish they had booths."}
{"text":"Our favorite pho place in Charlotte. We like the family atmosphere and the generous healthy portions of this amazing Vietnamese soup. I prefer he chicken pho but my wife likes the beef pho which can also come with things like tendon and tripe that give the authentic pho experience. They have excellent summer rolls and always fresh basil, bean sprouts, jalapeños and limes on the side. They have a wide selection of shakes and bubble teas, I prefer the durian shake. Also, Vietnamese coffee served hot or cold with sweet condensed milk. In the Central Avenue area that has a variety of interesting ethnic restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this place! Friendly atmosphere and very accommodating. My daughter loves the fried spring rolls.  Their pho never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've only tried this restaurant once, yet I would have to admit their food is excellent. I've had the best seafood pho with vegetable broth. I'm normally not a big fan of pho, but it was actually the best I've had by far. They have a rich menu and options for everyone. I did also try the summer rolls for an appetizer and that was also good. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and constantly checked on the tables. Would surely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were feelings adventurous and wanted to try something new. We walked in and was seated right away. We both ordered strawberry bubble tea. The server was on point and really nice. We will go back."}
{"text":"Pho was good and the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce were also above the average"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out on a rainy day because our friends who live nearby love it. We were seated right away. There were a lot of people already seated. I ordered the plain pho and noodles without meat for $5.50 while the bf got a large chicken pho for about $9. The food took a while but that's ok considering the crowd and the server was very nice and helpful (the menu is a little intimidating). The pho was delicious and comforting, the broth was not as flavorful as pho plus. The large is too large for anyone to finish. Total came to $17 plus tax.. Cheaper than pho plus and larger portions too. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Absolute BEST Pho in the city!  The broth is incredible and they do have part of the menu for beginners as well as those who are much more adventurous (no matter how adventurous I feel on any given day I don't think I will ever have the tripe)  The egg rolls are Amazing! Crispy, tasty, everything you could ever hope for in the other restaurants . . . but this time you get it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in Charlotte. We always drive 20 min here whenever we are craving for good pho. We always order the pho here and the fried springs here. Fried quails here are the best in town. The only other place that has fried quails is Doan's on South Blvd, but the quails and pho at Doan are less impressive than here. Service is ninja fast at Pho Hoa as well!!!"}
{"text":"Chain or no chain, Pho Hoa never disappoints. And the food always comes out at lighting speed, which is a good thing because when you're craving pho, nothing else satisfies. For colds and flus, I highly recommend the hot and spicy seafood pho. Ask them to throw in some raw garlic cloves."}
{"text":"I'm vegan.  My meatless dish was average, especially when compared to far superior meals that I've enoyed at Vietnam Grille and Lang Van.  The biggest issue with this restaurant, that will prevent me from ever coming back to it, was the lack of cleanliness.  The restaurant is dirty, and the bathrooms, are disgusting. The posted code rating for this restaurant was 90.00.  I don't see how a rating of 90.00 is possible.  The City of Charlotte would better serve its citizens by fining this place and closing it until it fit for food preparation and dining."}
{"text":"Best place for pho in town!! Fast and friendly service. Pho is always made to order the way you like it. They even cut the noodles for the kid's bowl of pho. Every bowl is worth trying!! The taro boba tea is a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now, I love this place so much! I've tried quite a few of the other Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte but Pho Hoa is my go to. Location is great, service is nice, and food is always perfect. Definitely not fine dining, but perfect for a casual lunch or dinner.  I usually get the steak and brisket pho, or the Bún Tôm Tht Nng (vermicelli noodle bowl with grilled pork and shrimp) and an order of their amazing crispy quail.  If you haven't tried the quail you have to!"}
{"text":"** Updated my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because I eat here at least once a week but could eat here everyday if my boyfriend would let me ** We got take out on a snow day. The take out service was friendly and casual. We ordered the #2 ($11 for large) steak and brisket pho and the #30 summer rolls (4.25 for 2 pcs). The pho comes separated from the noodles and you throw together everything when you get home. The summer rolls were pretty good, although I've had better (they were lacking mint/basil). The pho was awesome!!! Rich flavor and fresh meat and toppings. The large pho split into two large bowls at home, if you've got a normal appetite you could definitely split it. Overall great place and will be my go to spot this winter!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since i was little and its the best. I have tired other places but they always lack favor. The pho is awesome and have a lot of flavor.   I usually get #15 which comes with all the different type of meats. If you don't like noodles than you should try the beef stew and you can get it with noodles/ bread. I eat mines with rice which is also an option, but you have to tell them since its no listed.   If you are craving for papaya salad than your at the right place. Its top off with peanuts and the sauce have fermented crab meat. But you can  always tell them to leave it out.   Over all you should give this place a try.   Oh they also have daily noodle spacial thats no on the menu. Just look up on the walls and you'll see what they are."}
{"text":"Came back here second time by accident. The food was decent fast service. It's good when you crave for it. Although my fiancé like their bun bo hue."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and I'm sure I'll become a regular! This is the best Vietnamese food in Charlotte that I've had in the 12 years that I've been here. I got the pork/egg roll bún and my boyfriend got the brisket pho. We also got the house special fried rice which my boyfriend had for lunch the next day. Can't wait to go back and try some bubble tea, we were STUFFED!"}
{"text":"Best pho in the city ! Everything is well seasoned and the milky tea is the BEST! Definitely THE place to try. I suggest you get extra noodles because they fill a great helping of meat in every bowln"}
{"text":"Really great! I'm always down for some Pho. My friend and her husband come here often. This was my first time. I like that it wasn't crowded during the time that we went. Pho Hoa is located conveniently in the plaza midwood area. I believe that I'll be returning sometime in the future."}
