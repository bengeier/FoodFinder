{"text":"I was In the neighbourhood and looking for something quick and delicious, so I took a chance and headed into Delight Food (formally Ernie's). After conquering the chicken roti, I realized I found a gem. It was delicious, the chicken and potatoes were full of flavour and the wrap was fresh and soft. It looks to be a family run business and all behind the counter had smilesX on their faces. Tucked into a strip mall, seek it out for some good eats. Next up, I'll try the jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Was working near by and the smell drew me in. Friendly staff and enjoyed my oxtail meal. Will definitely be going back and try some other items."}
{"text":"Their Food is delicious. I eat here atleast once a month. Stew chicken is my favourite. Very underrated Caribbean restaurant"}
