{"text":"Horrible service.  Won't let us sit at the table we wanted.  Dining area is loud and servers gives you attitude and they keep yelling at the top of their lung.   Avoid at all cost.  Not worth the headache"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for rice noodle rolls. The texture is silky and smooth. I really like their rice noodle with the the fried dough stick. I will agree with previous complaints about the rice noodle not being evenly distributed. I actually don't mind it being that way as the type of food is meant to be casual & on-the-go. Overall nice place but there are equally better options around town."}
{"text":"Their rice noodles were done in traditional handcrafted way from China. The services were good once we got seated except for the long wait during lunch hours especially weekends. Our family felt was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow!! this place is the best for Chang fun. I had to order more to try more. Must try!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times, food are hit and miss. 

Rice Rolls (Chang Fan) are mostly good, Shrimp, beef, pork rolls are excellent, but BBQ pork is a miss.

Congee are standard, with quite a few more misses... so far the \"fishermen's congee\" is the one I like the most.

Deep fried dough sticks ?? are pretty good but the Ox-tongue pastry ??? is a miss...

Overall it is still good just by the rice roll itself and I will go back for more."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday afternoon with my mom and sister. It was packed when we first walked in and had to wait for a table. They told us it would be quick but did not give us a number. People that walked in after us however, got a number and their numbers were being called out. Of course I said something and they apologized and said we will get you seated next. We waited about 15 minutes before we were seated. 

After being shown to our table, we noticed some grease marks on some chairs as there were kids in there before us. We asked for some napkins to wipe it up. She then just threw the napkins on the table and said the menus are in there. We were a little thrown off. After 2 minutes of looking at the menu, the same lady comes back and asks if we're ready. When we said no, she sighed and walked away. 

When it came time to order, another server came by to take it. My sister and I cannot really speak Chinese so we let our mom order for us in Chinese . My mom thought it would be easier to give our orders if we were just giving the order numbers. The server then stopped my mom abruptly and said \"SORRY, we speak Chinese, so don't give me the number. Give me the name.\" That was extremely rude of the server. Don't get me wrong, my mom is fluent in Chinese so it was no problem but the server was condescending saying it like that. How can such a restaurant cater to the rest of the non-Chinese speaking population in the area? 

The food was great however. I love chang fun (or however you wanna spell it). It was soft and silky and we got one with the egg too. They have the hoisin sauce and peanut sauce, but only at the cash desk so you have to ask for it or go get it yourself. You can never go wrong with congee. There was definitely a lot of salt like the other review had mentioned. 

When it came time for the bill, the initial waitress dropped it off and just threw it on the table. I was so angry and upset at how rude this lady was. We decided to leave just a 10% tip. She came by as we were getting up, looked at it and put it back on the table and walked away. Are you f*cking kidding me? LOL. If something is wrong, chuck it at the door and don't bring it with you to work.

Overall, I think I would only come here for take out, which was very popular. The service is 
terrible and the staff all need some customer service training."}
{"text":"Yummy congee and rice roll. The best one I had for the price. Sip with hong kong milk tea, life is good."}
{"text":"a good classic place to go to for a simple lunch. i first went with my family when they just opened, had to wait 45 minutes to get a seat. they pretty much operate on congee and rice rolls. they originates from GZ china, so that was refreshing. my favorite congee place in toronto for a simple lunch would be the congee place in market village, the small mall next to pacific mall. i would say this place would be up next to my go tos now. they have a good selection of congee and rolls. the texture might be different from what you would order from yum cha places, but this texture is actually what i first had in GZ china, so i'm probably more use to it. but ppl who shun this place because of the \"sloppiness \" or because of the \"mushy\" texture probably won't value the culture behind these dishes. theres a reason why they are classics.
but anyhow, no negativity, all in all i would welcome their addition to the neighborhood. 
and decor, on point with their old school but clean chinese influence."}
{"text":"always a goto for me whenever im in that area. i like how they close at 12, very good late night snack
takeout is always really fast
dining in during mornings is extremely packed, 
i like going in at night because i usually dont have to wait"}
{"text":"There is always a lineup at this place. Also reading the review below, you can tell that for most of the people come here from Guangzhou knows about this place. I am a big fan of Chang fen and there is no better place for chang fen than this place in town. Almost every single review earlier states that the service isn't great, which I agree because there are pack of people. There is always a lineup, I don't think it is hard to figure out whether the food is good or bad."}
{"text":"If you're craving some authentic Chinese noodle rolls, this is the place to visit. It's congee is relatively the same with other places but it's hard to beat the rolls and the price. It's definitely one of Toronto's cheap eats. The sigh fritters were fresh and crispy, and the noodle rolls were filled with meat, veggies, and flavourful with the soy sauce.

The service is prompt although the washroom is really tiny. The line ups at the door never stop, which I can understand based on the food and the price. The decor is clean although a little cramped like your usual hole-in-the-wall restaurants, probably difficult to seat a group of 6 or more.

I will definitely be coming back here, if not for the rolls then for the amazing dough fritters. A great take out place to keep in mind."}
{"text":"My wife and I went at Sunday at 1 p.m. and waited a half an hour for a seat. I saw a group of two and a group of three have to share a table for 4 beside us. Luckily we did not have to share.

An older Chinese woman with a streak of purple in her hair looked to be in charge a ran a tight ship. It was busy but not chaotic like on those reality cooking shows. The menu is nice and simple: appetizers, beverages, the noodle wrap thingy and congee. We were not in the mood for congee, so we had one order of beef and one order of chicken. We decided to share a Hong Kong milk tea which was good though I'm sure a lot of places could do it this well.

There was a silky smooth taste to both the beef and chicken giving a very nice mouth feel. That was quite distinct from what you get at dim sum places. We liked the beef better than the chicken finding the latter too subtle. The silky texture is different but I do not think it adds that much to the taste experience as the dish was only say 5% better than dim sum places.

The prices for the two were $4.50 to $5.50 for each which I am told is good. I never crave for this type of dish so I am not sure I would line up for it when there are so many other places to try.

This place reminded me of restaurants in Hong Kong and brought back memories: cold but efficient staff, a tiny washroom that could use a paint job and did not look the most well taken care of. That said, the washroom was relatively clean.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a chain from Guangzhou, China, with this first location dating back to 1958. Featuring its rice noodle rolls: made in-house, and made to perfection, with super thin layers. Be prepared to wait in line (though turnover time is relatively quick).

1) Marinated Beef&Shrimp roll 
2) Veggie roll (greens and mushrooms)
3) beef congee
4) fried dough fritters 
5) Deep fried fish skin

The Cheung fun here is so delicious!!! I felt it was a tad oily though but still delicious! I actually really liked the vegetarian Cheung fun. The beef and shrimp ones are good too. 

Also got the congee and fried dough fritters. Nothing too special here. Lots of people ordered the fried fish skin, so we did too. It didn't feel oily at all which was great! It was super crispy and done really well if you're into that kind of stuff."}
{"text":"First of all, I didn't know this place originates from Guangzhou, China.  But the first time I stepped in for take out I could sense something different, it felt exactly like if you were to walk into a similar place in China.  I knew the food wasn't going to be bad, and it turned out to be really good.  My go-to place for weekend breakfast even though it's quite a bit of drive.  Rice rolls and dough sticks are really good, the sauce is perfect, not too salty and congee is really good.  A lot of congee places normally have plain congee bases and add toppings depending on the orders. Congee here I felt like the toppings are cooked together with the congee which means more flavour and it's the way it should be done.  I could be wrong but I just find the congees here more flavourful.

Price is very reasonable, ordered a bunch of items and it's like $22 or something.

One thing that's lacking is hot soya drink,  they only serve cold which gives me a feeling that the soya drink is not made in house.

Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Definitely try to arrive as early as you can in the morning. Tried rice rolls (with and without egg), beef congee and dough fritters - all were delicious. To my surprise enjoyed the rice roll with egg mixed in more than the regular kind without! Remember it's cash only."}
{"text":"Came to Yin Ji Chang Fen on a Tuesday evening for a quick snack. The place was clean, large, with tons of tables, and a giant TV screen showing Chinese cooking shows.

I liked how the menu explained the story behind the famed Guangzhao franchise. I ordered the marinaded beef and shrimp chang fen. It came out within 5-10 minutes. It was quite tasty, I like how it was not drenched in soy sauce. I was able to add some peanut sauce and sesame seeds on top.  The price was quite high for what I got. The portion was good, but I have gotten cheaper Chang Fen for similar quality at other places in Markham. I will return and try the congee next time !"}
{"text":"This place specializes in rice rolls and congee. It is almost always packed so be prepared to wait and share tables with others.

The rice rolls are a little more pricey than dim sum places, but they are very silky and full with stuffing. Instead of 2 or 3 small rolls, the rice roll is one giant roll that fills the entire plate. I would've preferred if the soya sauce was on the side so I could add it myself as it is too salty for my liking the way it is. 

The congee is pretty average. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of congee anyways.

Overall, 3.5/5 which rounds up to 4. Would be back occasionally."}
{"text":"came here friday night at 7pm and it was already buzzing! by the time we left around 7:45 there was a small wait for the patrons at the door. 

i'm a sucker for chinese street food, and this place doesn't disappoint. they have a whole page of selection for the cheong fun and another page the congee. my friend and i were both full with just a $35 ish bill.

hot tip: the HK cold milk tea is great! it comes in a plastic cup inside of a larger bowl surrounded by ice chips so it doesn't water down your tea."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday at 2pm to try to avoid the peak crowd. Since we only waited for about 15 minutes, I guess that counts as a success? Lol

The great thing about this place is that in my opinion at least, the rice noodle rolls were DELICIOUS. Definitely worth the higher price tag. I was planning to take pictures but my family dug into everything and it was all gone before I knew it :P

That's the end of the good part, though...everything else was pretty lacklustre. The congee was just standard (albeit a bit saltier and smaller than what I was used to). The food came out at different times - the cheung fun first, but the last congee we ordered took forever...the space was way too small for the tables, so everyone was squeezed together. Hard to hold a conversation too because it was so loud. The A/C wasn't strong enough so I was sweating profusely while eating the hot food, which made it somewhat unpleasant to say the least. Service was...well. Make sure you use your outdoor voice and wave your arms vigorously when trying to get anything.

I may come back for take-out if I'm in the area and it's not the busiest hours; otherwise, this is the first and last try for me and I think I'll stick with the more traditional dim sum choices in the future."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to spot for some traditional Chang Fen that really makes you feel at home. All of their Chang Fen offerings are very traditional and the taste is delicious. Prices are also very low and affordable. It's just simply the perfect comfort food for a long and tiring day. Also ordered the congee, which was very cheap and generous portions. Expect to spend under $10 here and leave with a full belly! Or you can splurge a bit and try many of the items on the plentiful menu. 

Yin Ji did not disappoint. It is a hidden gem that provides you with a traditional meal that brings you back to your roots. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The rice rolls were soggy and mushy.   The congee was just ordinary. The services were poor.  They put you into a small table and they packed as much as customers to the max.  This place is so uncomfortable. You can find better place than this. This place is just overrated."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place one late night since I just wanted to eat a small snack. 

The service is quick and the waitress we had was nice and funny loll no pressure to order anything and gave us good recommendations. 

food came out pretty quick and it was really good. The rice noodle was so silky and soft, I wanted to keep eating! Haha. We ordered just two rice noodles and nothing else. Maybe I'll try the other dishes next time. 

I'll come back if I ever want a snack sized meal!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite if you're craving congee or rice noodle rolls! A no-frills place with a small menu, but really fresh and tasty rice noodle rolls for under $5 and congee for under $6.

My go-to is the mushroom and chicken rice noodle roll as well as the plain one.

Seating is quite limited and gets packed (i.e. lineups) during lunch hour, so it can be a long wait and difficult to get a seat."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Chinese comfort food, this is a great place for congee and rice noodles. There are a variety of menu options to choose from and very reasonably priced. We ordered about 10 different items and shared them family style amongst the four of us - 3 varieties of congee, Curry fishballs, deep fried dough fritters, and rice noodles. This gave us a chance to try a variety of dishes. Flavours were great and didn't leave me feeling thirsty afterwards like most Chinese restaurants do (possibly because of the MSG). Service was pretty good and efficient. If you're thinking of trying this place, I recommend coming during off peak hours (2-4pm) to get a seat or you may need to wait at least 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The instant I stepped in, I was overwhelm with a wave of nostalgia. Everything just reminded me of my childhood and the sweet remnant memories of home. You know it's authentic when it has TVB playing in the background. 

$4.50 - Sticky Rice Wrap (2 pieces)

$4.75 - Hongkog Curry fish ball

$2.25 - HK milk tea 

$5.75 - Beef & shrimp chives noodle rolls (Recommend)

$5.50 - Pork liver congee (Recommend)

Definitely recommend the noodle rolls and congee, what they're known for! Place is always packed and flooded with people, didn't have to wait long at all. Cantonese speaking with they can work with English."}
{"text":"Very delicious food with affordable price. Will come again. My coworker complains the staff's English isn't too good. Not a concern for Mandarin or Cantonese speakers, though."}
{"text":"OMG dude, this is like a dream come true! Even since I left china I have yet to taste a authentic \"Chang Fen\". Chang fen is like a thin rice flour made omelette shaped thingy with lots of different goodies inside. I got their recommended selections and, boy, was I in for a treat! The Chang Fens here are way better than all of the ones I had in various dim sum places in the GTA.

Come give this place a go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with 2 of my friends. Ordered their signature rice rolls. Its really light tasty and melts in your mouth. We also ordered congess not thing special and fried fish skins which is really a must have when you're having congee. I noticed that for a chinese restaurant they dont freely offer condiments such as soy sauces or chili oil. Its a matter of prefernce i like my chili oils, will definitely be coming back again and probably bring my own chili oil."}
{"text":"Affordable food | cash only | speedy | dont expect amazing service* | may have wait time* | limited parking | opens late

*your typical hk style fast in fast out type. Not that the service is bad there's just not much. So don't be offended.

D2 ice based hk milk tea is good and will not get watered down since the ice is out of the cup but keeps it cool. Price of this is $4.25.

Their rice noodle rolls are fresh, thin and smooth. I love their R9 pork liver with chives one. They have an interesting one who h is R16 egg rice noodle roll. It's your typical rice noodle roll but wrapped in egg. Price range from $3.75-$5.75.

Their congees come fresh and hot. So be careful. If you order C6 pork liver congee it may take quite some time. It's typically cheaper to order their preset ones rather than customizing. Price range around $5 per bowl.

Remember this is a cash only reataurant. There is a TD bank in the same plaza (on the north east corner) beside t&t and Starbucks"}
{"text":"I visited last week with my mother at this fast-casual restaurant. I called it this way because it is an upscale version of a quick service restaurant with some variation in the menu. The waitresses are welcoming when I walked in, and the ambiance is like you are in Hong Kong. There is a big screen TV that plays HK news. The rice rolls and the congee are the primaries dishes where people go for. My favorite is the black egg congee with pork and the shrimp or beef rice roll. They were tasty and incomparable to some full-service Chinese restaurants in Scarborough or Markham because they are of good quality and quantity. And the price is good for the portion. You will not get it wrong. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"The best place to go for some cheap, but yummy rice noodle rolls and congee - a staple combination! This place offers a variety of different rice noodle rolls you can choose from and I could tell that the rice noodles are much more authentic than typical dim sum joints. I'm no expert, but I could tell right away from the quality of the food. 

I came here twice in a row while I was sick and the congee definitely helped me get better much quicker. My friend and I ordered chicken congee, curry fish balls, and two different types of rice noodle rolls (if I remember correctly, one was with beef and chives, the other with just shrimp) Regardless, I had no problem shamelessly downing everything that we ordered. 

Surprisingly though, even though it does not seem like much food - I found myself pretty stuffed by the end of our meal! 

The only thing that bothered me were the smell of the cups. Two times that I've been there and their cups have a chlorine type smell. No Bueno to that. 

*Unfortunately, they don't take card so remember to bring cash with you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant originate from Guang Zhou. I never been to GZ, nevermind about tasting or comparing. 

Knowing the fact, assuming it is quite well know and popular. Third famous cheung fun (rice noodle roll in Toronto/ Markham (first one was Sam's Congee Delight; second was my kitchen which is now closed); there is always a massive line up. I got lucky and waited 20m for a table for 2 on Saturday. For takeouts sometimes they are so busy they refuse to have takeout orders or they will let you know the wait time for take out is 40mins or so. I had both sit in and take out experience. 

Sit in - packed, humid, but worth trying. Food comes hot, fresh and quick. Downfall is once you finish you need to get going..otherwise people waiting will start staring at your table. 

Take out- waited approx 30m for 3 congee and 4 rolls. Rice noodle rolls comes in good plastic containers not Styrofoam. I got home and the rolls were still hot (not steamy) but it didn't stick to each other (which I hate takeout noodles does) nor was it hard Or clumpy. Nonstick but no oil.  amazing eh. 

Simple menu: rice noodle rolls, congee, snacks (curry fishball) and milk tea. No coffee. 

Rice noodle is very soft and silky. Lots of ingredients. 
Congee comes with everything (cilantro, green onions) unless you tell them otherwise. People say it was salty.. I didn't find it salty but ofc they have MSG. (I wasn't thirsty tho unlike Sam's delight Congee)

Very good place to try, quick, fast and yummy."}
{"text":"Wow. This Cheung fun is amazingly silky. I did not care too much for the congee. 

The only issue is that it's packed so much food that it breaks very easily. 

I think the trade off for extra fresh and silky Cheung fun is worth it.

I would not recommend the soy bean milk since it's in the carton and not fresh."}
{"text":"Small place but super busy and there is always a line up.  The \"cheun fun\" is very good that I don't mind lining up for. The congee is also good. With this quality it's already hard to find in Toronto or even in some Asia."}
{"text":"Bad. Not even going to compare to Yin Ji in Guangzhou, it can't even get a passing grade for standard rice rolls. The rice roll wrapping is soo soft that as you pick it up with chopsticks, the roll just breaks entirely. There is no chew whatsoever; I was practically just eating rice mush and separate pieces of meat and shrimp. You can't call it a rice roll if you can't eat it as a roll.

The pork liver congee was prepared bad as well. I've never eaten pork liver cut into cubes and chunks instead of thin slices. The texture just isn't right.

This place is all hype."}
{"text":"Their rice rolls are no doubt , a must have. Warm, moist and so soft! Highly addictive ! I was pleasantly surprised their congee. So flavourful and aromic. I appreciate that they don't try to thicken it with rice powder like the gooey texture from other congee places. All for a really affordable price!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as we were craving some chinese rice rolls.

The restaurant was pretty busy on a Sunday night.
We ordered: 
Mixed shrimp and beef rice roll
Mushroom and chicken rice roll plus egg
Mixed seafood congee
Fish congee

We ordered the above to share between 3 people and we were super full.
The service was ok, but overall it was pretty good, would definitely be back again."}
{"text":"hands down fav Chang Fen place in TorontoPrice is very reasonable, my fav is their beef shrimp with clive and bbq pork. Go in their off peak times otherwise theres gonna be long lineup for sure."}
{"text":"A recent Cantonese restaurant that specializes in congee, rice noodle rolls and street style snacks. 

Location/Service
Located within the T&T plaza, on the same side as Boston Pizza and Ajisen Ramen. The place probably fit around 30-40 people, so best ideal to come in out of prime busy hours. No reservations are taken, you get a number and wait to be seated. 

Inside has a lot of their history, as it's originated from Gongzhou. A lot of awards are also posted, pretty good reputation expanding over to Canada. 

Staff are friendly and knows Cantonese. They are also on alert and fast with the orders. 


Food
I ordered a lot of dishes to share. 
The Hong Kong style frozen milk tea is a must try. I like how the ice is separated, keeping the milk tea strong and fresh and away from being diluted with the ice melting. 

HK style curry fish ball and sweet cruller are also worth to try. The fish ball is a little soft on its core. I like it better if it's a little harder cause it gives a more chewy taste. Sweet cruller is made fresh, not overly fried. Inside is warm and soft, perfect for a cold windy day or to pair it with congee. 

Rice noodle dishes include shrimp & chive, marinated pork & beef and dough stick rice. All dishes have thin rice noodle, which is great cause it doesn't overload the flavour with flour/starch. I like the dough stick one the best, but all others are also well made, large in quantity and packed with meat. Note the shrimp & chive and marinated pork/beef are award winning dishes!

The congee (don't really know the English name) is a HK local that has squid, peanuts, fish and chives. It's my all time favorite and it did not disappoint. 


Overall, I enjoyed my first time here. Prices are cheap and portions are big. Definitely feels like home with a traditional comforting taste."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. Cheong funs are pretty good, fried dought and sweet fried dought is very good. Congee is pretty average. Expect a line. If you like your rice noodles soft, i will suggest not adding the eggs, which will harden it a bit. Still good but much bettet without it."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

This is a new joint specializing in rice noodle rolls which just opened this week. They are a franchise that originated from Guangzhou, China and are quite popular over there as well.

Tried a couple of their rice roll dishes and they were excellent! Ingredients were fresh and substantial. The rice roll is thin, smooth and silky. 

Congee gets watery quite fast so if you are use to the smooth and thicker consistency then skip it. 

Update:

Service was chaotic and it still is the second time I went. Tried their dough sticks and it was super oily although crispy. All you can taste is the oil as it oozes right out after you bite into it. 

Congee takes a super long time to arrive for some reason. Be prepared to have your dough sticks (if you insist on ordering it) sit there in the cold for 15-20 minutes before your congee arrives. Also my mom wanted to try their congee and this time it seems to be significantly saltier than last time. Perhaps they ran out of MSG the first time I went and now it's back in stock."}
{"text":"Was it good?  I thought it was pretty good!  We ordered 3 kinds of rice rolls (we discovered each plate to be one large roll with a decent amount of filling), a sliced fish congee, and a dough fritter.  It was like eating dimsum at night.

What's on the menu?  A pretty big selection of different rice noodle rolls and variations congee.  
They also have a few snacks: sticky rice in lotus leaf, fish balls, fried dough, etc.  

Service was fast and wasn't as curt as you would normally find most Chinese restaurants.  

Would I line up to eat here?  Unlikely.  If it's going to take more than 5-10 minutes, I would take a pass.  If I can walk right in, then I'm definitely a fan. I'd give this place 3.5 stars, rounding up to a 4."}
{"text":"This is the best rice noodles roll in town you must try, congee also very delicious. No doubt to go for a hot meal especially during the winter time, worse thing is no matter what time you go, still need to wait for a long queue."}
{"text":"I like this. The staff aren't particularly enthusiastic, but they're efficient. Everything is fast, cheap, and quite delicious. You won't be disappointed by the food, but the seating is a little cramped.

The congee is roughly the size of 2 individual bowls. Everyone eats pretty fast and by the pace of the business, it isn't a place to sit around and chat.

Definitely worth trying out, no real complaints except for the fact that the bowls felt like they weren't super clean."}
{"text":"Came here at lunch hour on a Saturday and the place was packed! Luckily there was one table that was open for two people so we didn't have to wait. We ordered 2 plates of shrimp and chives and 1 plate of pork and chives but we got 2 plates of pork and chives and 1 of the shrimp instead. They were really busy so we didn't exchange it back to our original order. Nonetheless, the rice rolls were well made and very silky. It came with enough toppings inside which made each bite so delicious."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese breakfast joint serving congee and rice roll as main staple. Menu is small about 3 pages one is appetizers and drinks, rice roll and last congee. 
Rice rolls are pretty good and price is reasonable as well. 
Rice rolls are made fresh to order hence why so popular. Rice are are paper thin and with lots of toppings also you can have the option of adding egg or extra meat. 
Also service congee along with other snacks to go along. 
Wait time is high as store is pretty small, avoid going during peak hours."}
{"text":"When the weather is rainy, cold and soggy, this place is the go to for chinese comfort food. Craving for hot congee, I spotted this place tucked in the plaza. 

Shrimp and Beef with chives rice roll: Freshly made rice roll that is paper thin. It was not only packed with flavours but with variety of ingredients: beef, shrimp,lettuce and aromatic chives. The beef was very tender and juicy, the shrimp was crunchy and well cooked. The addition of chives wraps up the rice roll with aromatic taste. The soy sauce was sweet which complimented the rice roll very well

Lai Wan style congee: It was hot and the rice was not too mushy . Unlike other places that aren't generous with the fillings,  I like that here it's LOADED with squid, fish,pork skin and shrimp.  Topped up with generous of scalions and ginger. This sure will warm you up! Unfortunately, it was 1/4 teaspoon too much of salt/msg

I only gave 3.5 stars because the congee is abit too salty and not enough sweet soy sauce for the huge portion of rice roll."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  It's got some simple, homey, comforting food and it's not going to break the bank!  This place is known for their rice rolls.  These are similar to the kind you get at cantonese dim sum places.  You can choose between a variety of meats you want in the rice rolls.  We ordered 2 orders of shrimp rolls, 1 beef roll, fried fish skin, fish congee, and a fried dough stick.  Everything was really good and our food came out really fast.  This place is not big on the inside so there can be a lot of people waiting but it didn't take us too long to get a table.  This kind of food I can eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack!!!  Yuuuuumm!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the very very famous rice noodle roll restaurant in Guangzhou. Born and raised in Guangzhou, I have a high expectation for this place. But after my visit, there's a lot of improvement to be made.

Operations: this is very disappointed as we took a number waiting in line. During the waiting period, I heard a lot of people missing their numbers called out and customers were very unhappy about this. We were called to a table then we learned someone waiting before us didn't get their table, so we had to wait in line again.

Food: the rice noodle rolls (??) are very authentic. Hope they can give me more toppings as in Guangzhou. The rolls tastes smooth and silky as I remember, which still satisfies my crave for this place. 

Maybe some yelpers do not appreciate the rice noodle rolls soaking in the soy sauce, but it is the authentic Guangzhou way of having it. Just like people like California rolls but they didn't exist in Japan. As a person raised in Guangzhou and had rice noodle rolls almost once a week there, I find Yin Ji's rice noodle rolls are quite fair.

We also ordered fried dough stick (??), curry fish balls (????) and Hong Kong style frozen milk tea (????). I won't recommend any of these three, as you will not see the fish balls and milk tea in Guangzhou Yin Ji restaurants (they're Hong Kong style foods) and they're overpriced. Dough sticks are poorly executed, dough not fermented  enough and a lot of oil excess staying inside the dough.

All in all, I will give the new establishment a couple few months before I visit back and hope for improvement in both operations and localizing themselves for Torontorians. Next time I will come back and try their congee."}
{"text":"I finally got to eat at Yin Ji Chang Fen!  My parents and I tried to eat there a few months ago when we were back in the GTA, but we went on a Saturday around lunchtime and the place was packed.  They tried to seat us with some strangers at a larger table (which is not uncommon at some Chinese eateries), which is not my preference, but I am willing to endure some inconveniences for good food, but by father would have none of that, so we left.  I had essentially resigned myself to the fact that I would probably never get to eat there. Fast forward a few months later, we were back in Markham.  My mom proposed we try again on a Friday afternoon at 5pm.  My dad said \"No, I don't want to sit with strangers!\"  So I proposed that we go and see how busy it was.  If it was busy, we would leave and try some other place, but if it was quiet and there were lots of empty tables we would try it out.  Dad agreed.  Given the popularity of this place, I wasn't too optimistic, but lo and behold, it was not very busy and we scored a small table for just the 3 of us!  

We ordered shrimp rice rolls ($5.25), beef rice rolls ($5.25), shrimp and beef rice rolls ($5.99), egg rice rolls ($3.99), assorted congee ($5.99) and Chinese cruellers ($2.25).

All the rice rolls were delicious.  Really soft with a nice consistency.  The meat ones had a generous portion of meats inside, along with some chives.  I had never had egg rice rolls before, and while it was good, I prefer the meat filled ones.  It had a mild egg flavour, but essentially tasted like a plain rice roll.  

I didn't have any of the Chinese cruellers, because I don't like them in general, but my parents said they were good.

The servers forgot about our congee.  We had finished all the rice rolls and were still waiting for the congee.  Then we noticed people arriving after us being served congee before us.  When my mom asked about it, they realized that they forgot.  We had to wait a bit longer and then they finally brought it out.  By that time, the cruellers (which my parents ordered to eat with the congee) were cold :( There may have been an apology, but no other compensation for the forgotten dish.  

I'm not a congee fan, so my parents had the congee.  They said it was good and they tasted some fish, squid, ginger, fried vermicelli, lettuce, peanuts and maybe some pork skin in it.

One thing that I was not a big fan of was the fact that they serve you hot tea in a plastic glass poured from a plastic jug.  And not the type of plastic that is made specifically for hot beverages.  They were regular plastic glasses and plastic jugs meant for cold water.  I was super nervous about drinking toxic chemicals from the plastic that would leech into the hot tea :(  Also, holding a plastic glass that has a hot liquid in it kind of burns your hand!  

The servers here are not fluent in English, so I found communication a bit difficult.  I still don't actually know what exactly was in the \"assorted congee\" despite asking.

I felt that service was focused on getting people in and out.  The servers did all thank us and said bye to us when we left.  

This restaurant is in a shopping plaza.  Same plaza as the T&T and Green Grotto.  Lots of free parking."}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout after work - ordered congee and a bbq egg rice roll. Very efficient and fast takeout service (called on the phone to order before heading there). Have heard good things about this place, but was never a congee fan. Since i was sick i decided to grab congee - not much of an appetite anyways. Congee was very hot & lots of good ingredients inside including small slithers of ginger which i needed for my sore throat ( i had the shredded pork and century egg one?). Overall very impressed & will revisit again when im not sick!"}
{"text":"It's my new go-to joint when I feel like eating something simple. 

When it comes to Chinese food, you can't get more simple than congee; and this place makes it good! Perfect texture. Not too thick and not too watery. Plenty of flavour.

Their steamed noodle rolls are also good with the texture.  So slippery, you'll find it a challenge to grasp with your chopsticks.

Of course, I always order the deep friend dough sticks and that was fried to perfection.

After of 3 bowls of congee, 1 steamed rice roll and 1 order of the fried dough sticks= total of $26.

The servers are fast, the food comes out slow but the price is nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"I loveeeee the food here! It's super simple yet delicious and savoury.

I came here with a friend for brunch on a Saturday and was surprised to see how long the line was at 10AM! But after tasting the food I quickly understood why this place is so popular. 

Atmosphere: 3/5
- small, clean and simple 
- super busy on weekends... we waited for about 20 minutes before getting a table for 2 

Food: 5/5
- we ordered deep fried dough, a congee with pork and preserved golden egg and their famous beef&shrimp rice noodle roll. The total was only $14 which was enough for us two!  
- perfectly flavoured congee ($5). Not overly salty and limited MSG flavours
- the rice noodle roll was only $6 and they used real beef! Unlike many dim sum places that serve those with mashed up beef 
- deep fried dough was only $2 and paired extremely well with the congee 

Service: 5/5
- Super fast!
- you have to speak mando/canto to them tho 

I highly recommend coming here for a healthy and light brunch!"}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for 5days, traveling from downtown to markham just to have Yin Ji Chang Fen for three mornings. Everything taste the same as we had in GuangZhou. Hoping to have it in Boston. Love it!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not sure what the hype is all about for this place. I think blogto exaggerated how good it was that it almost disappointed me. But of course I have to remain objective. They make good rice noodle rolls and congee but it's nothing all that fancy. 

With that being said, it was delicious but nothing over the top and waiting for our order to come out took a bit longer than I expected.

It's pretty modern and the menu is limited so it makes it easier to decide and for them it's super easy to make since there's not much on the menu. 

I will be coming back here for late night cheap eats."}
{"text":"\"My friends think you're good looking. My female friends think you're nice.\" 
That's how clearly I could hear the conversation next to me as I was seated so close to the two tables beside me that our elbows could touch. Oh, and the girl was not good looking even with the heavy makeup and ginormous contacts. Yes I'm savage when I don't have a pleasant food outing experience. 

I would definitely recommend takeout here as I do love their Chang fen. The price is right and the food tastes good - just not at the restaurant where it was so loud and I couldn't move in my seat without accidentally hitting someone."}
{"text":"I've had better.

The Plain Rice Noodle Roll tasted very smooth indeed as that's what they're famous for. However, I didn't like that it wasn't previously cut up which made it difficult to share and eat.  The Plain Rice Noodle Roll is frequently paired with peanut butter sauce and sweet sauce but instead of having it in bottles ready for you to pour from, they served the two sauces in a tiny bowl accompanying the plate. Why can't they have them on the table in bottles for self-serve like Sam's Congee Delight?  Same thing for the sesame seeds.  You have to ask the server to sprinkle it on for you. 

The Marinated Pork & Beef with Chives Rice Noodle Roll was just as smooth and fluffy as the plain one and I liked that the pork and beef pieces were very smooth and tender too.  However, as with the plain one, I didn't like that the rice noodle rolls weren't cut up already.  Also, the rice noodle roll 'skin' didn't actually wrap around all of the the pork and beef.  When you lifted the layer of rice noodle roll, all the beef and pork pieces fell out.  I didn't like that.

Next, our bowls of congee arrived.  I love eating Hong Kong style minced beef congee (where the beef is a bit raw and it cooks further in the hot congee as you eat it; it's mushy and soft).  The Minced Beef Congee here at Yin Ji Chang Fen wasn't up to my liking at all.  The \"minced beef\" was actually just loose pieces of rough-tasting beef.  When I used the spoon to stir it all together before eating, the individual pieces of beef just floated around in separate chunks. The congee was topped with a small portion of peanuts, shredded lettuce, and cilantro.  

Yin Ji Chang Fen takes over the space previously occupied by Pho Viet.  

Yin Ji Chang Fen had lots of customers come in for dinner during our entire time spent there; a good meal for a single diner, couples, or a small family."}
{"text":"Food is authentic...Soy sauce is tasty, rice rolls are fresh and chewy as they should be. Meat was tender and juicy. 

Atmosphere is quite dynamic...servers running back and forth, people standing and waiting for tables. One item of our order was forgotten so we had to remind them of it and one item (tea) was delivered although we didn't order one. If service was more prompt it would be 5 star. 

Recommended to arrive prior to 10:30 or else be prepared to wait for a table. Cash only."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick Chinese meal, this is the place to go. Although their menu says \"cook time: 15 minutes\" for their congee, realistically it only took about 5-10 minutes. This place is known for their infamous Cheng fun (rice noodle). My go-to order is their shrimp and chives rice noodle, marinated beef and chives rice noodle, fried dough stick roll and a congee. 

Downside of this place is that the service here isn't the greatest. When you enter, there's no one there to give you a number and sometimes people who come in after you would try to cut the line and get a number before you do. So be sure to wave someone down the moment you enter! The staff here are always busy, so it's extremely hard to ask them for anything (ie. ordering or getting the bill). The restaurant is also fairly small, so sometimes you may have to share a table with someone if you're alone or with one person. On top of it being busy, there's also minimal parking space if you are planning on parking near the restaurant. But despite the busy traffic, I would still recommend going here for their deliciously thin authentic Cheng fun. 

Side note: they only accept cash!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. If you are a Chang den lover then come here, but $5 per dish when you can get it for $3 at dim sum? Think about it. Quality for Chang fen is better but you decide whether it's forth the extra $2 per dish. Their dough fritters were good, but everything else was average"}
{"text":"Originating in Guangzhou, this street side stall turned crowd favourite now has a flagship store in Markham. The chang fun was nice and silky, with a good amount of fillings. Sam's congee and dough fritter chang fun are done better in my opinion but this place is great if have a craving. I do suggest asking for the soya to be served on the side if you don't like to eat too much soya sauce."}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought this place was pretty good and I would come back for breakfast and lunch. This place brings back nostalgic memories and I thought the food was tasty and quick! Came at around 8:30pm and there was a bit of a wait. Once we got seated the food came pretty promptly. We ordered 2 of the congee, the steamed noodles, fried dough, and frozen milk tea.

The congee was pretty decent, other reviews said it was too watery but I honestly prefer this. It didn't feel too watery to me, it was thinner than usual but it's a good balance.

The steamed noodles were great, we got the shrimp and beef one and also cha siu with egg. The star is def the shrimp/beef since the skin is so soft and thin!

Fried dough was good, a bit oily but goes good with congee.

Milk tea was good but it definitely wasn't \"frozen\", shoulda been colder or at least partially frozen.

The washrooms were quite dirty...other than that it's a good place."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant many times and noticed it was always packed. I finally got to try it on a Sunday morning. The tables were about 90% filled at around 9:30am. We ordered the beef and shrimp rice noodle roll, century egg and beef congee and fried dough. The rice noodle roll was very soft and silky, the beef was in big pieces and portion was decent. Congee tasted pretty good, and the pork in the congee was not ground pork unlike most restaurants; it was chunky pieces. The fried dough was quite fresh. Overall, a good experience. I'll definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I usually go to market village for my rice rolls (Cheung fun) and congee, but we drove by this place and hey what do Yelpers do? For better or for worst...till bad food do we part;)

I have to say the rice rolls are very very good. Authentically made, and made thinly. Definitely not the hard store bought kind. 
Comparable to Sam's congee, even thinner. 
We ordered the liver and chives rice rolls, thousand year egg and lean meat congee, minced meet congee (my hubby added an egg to it) and fried dough stick. 
The rice rolls.....OMG the liver was just right and fresh with none of that chewy gamy texture. Rolled together with the thin silky rice roll.....hmmm. 
The congee was alright, meat was tender and the congee was nice and thick. Not runny, but then again the star of the place is the rice rolls. Boy did they do them justice.
Everything else was like a supporting role. 

I think this relationship will last awhile."}
{"text":"Tried their congee, beef/shrimp rice rolls and steamed sticky rice wrap.

What stood out was the rice rolls, where the beef was cooked perfectly (slightly pink). It was tender and juicy.

The congee was average. The sticky rice came in two pieces, but 1 was \"darker coloured\" and flavourful than the other piece. I assume they were made/steamed at different time, that caused the inconsistency. 

Overall I thought it's still pretty good food, given the price and service. Seating a little cramped if sitting in the middle aisle; much more roomy on the side tables. Will go back to try more."}
{"text":"Bring cash! Prices are decent and service was alright, a bit hard to grab their attention but quick once you do. When comparing to a congee restaurant, the rice noodle rolls are comparable in price but has more filling.

Lots of people in and out, hear from others usually there are lines. BlogTo video perhaps?

Wish they had more than just rice noodle rolls and congee along with a few fried dough fritters. Get the sweet one!"}
{"text":"This review is for take out only. 

I walked into this restaurant to pick up some take out. Even as I parked my car, I saw a lot of people waiting in front of the door. So I was gasped and wondered how bad is the crowd once I stepped inside. And of course, I wasn't shocked this restaurant is lively and filled with people. Anyhow.

I got some plain rice rolls and fried dough fritters to go cause I just had a craving for it. As this place is new, I was gonna give it a try just to compare to other similar restaurants. The rice rolls was pretty good, as it didn't stick together even after an hour. Flavour wise is not too bad. Onto the fried dough fritters, not super oily or soggy. However these were leaning to the chewy side. So it is a pros and cons.

I would come back strictly for take out as I don't foresee this restaurant will slow down in terms of patron visits."}
{"text":"Came here once as it was really hyped up at the time. Was very excited for their rice noodles but I think I came in with too high expectations. 

Yin Ji Chang Fen has decent rice noodle rolls and the fillings range from your typical BBQ pork or shrimp to ones with egg or peanuts. 

We ordered their congee as well which were decent in taste too, but nothing out of the ordinary.

I felt like it had a tad bit too much msg though, but other than that the flavours were good. I'm not sure if I would come back specifically though as I think I would prefer Chang fen from dim sum places or so."}
{"text":"This is a famous branch of restaurant from guangzou china. And has opened its first branch overseas. The lineup for this place is very big due to the grand opening and a large following. To be honest the food was okay. The rice roll however could use more meat as it was almost completely just rice roll covering. Sam conger nearby does a lot better then they do. The service to be honest. Is hectic the servers rush you. But the cooks are slow the delivery of food is extremely slow for a rice roll place that does nothing else. Honestly im not impressed.  The food is worth 2 stars but the service was so bad it pushed it down to 1. Definitely would not recommend aa there are plenty of restaurants that serve better or similar foods without the bad service"}
{"text":"Really good rice noodles, silky and smooth, lots of ingredients inside too. Congee was also good, we ordered the seafood mixed one (lan wan). Some reviews commented the congee being bland and thin. I didn't think so. Overall, food was really delicious but wait for a table was long (we went Sunday around 12:30 tho). I would advise going early."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworkers. The rice rolls are pretty good but smaller portion than what I expected. Normally rice rolls come with 3 rolls but this one only came with two.

I also got the congee which was too watered down and not that flavourful. With the congee, we ordered a side of deep fried dough sticks - these were pretty good but kinda got sick of eating it after eating one.

I would probably come back and just get the rice rolls next time.

Restaurant is pretty clean and the ladies working here are super nice and efficient."}
{"text":"quick chinese comfort food! Luckily for me, snagged the last table before the line up started. From what i heard, this place is always packed at lunch and dinner. But don't fret, the turn around is quick. The portions are snack size, so its good for individual (order one congee is good enough) or order several stuff to try and share.

Liver congee is good here and the rice rolls are soft and good quality!"}
{"text":"Looked for a quick spot to fulfill my hunger in the morning and found Yin Ji Chang Fen. Everything seemed freshly made, and the congee tasted good and came in a huge bowl.

The value is there, but I can't say that you will get filled up eating this. The beef rice noodle rolls were good, but not filling. Apparently they have the best rice noodle according to their sign.

The restaurant space is clean and spacious. Service was quick and food came out quickly!"}
{"text":"Location: This restaurant is situated in the busy busy T&T plaza. I got a little lost looking for it because I was recommended by people to try. I figured I can just park in the middle of the plaza and easily find it. It was actually on the side of Boston pizza and sort of found myself walking around the outside of the building -- found the restaurant facing the street rather than the middle of the plaza.

Atmosphere: Very typical Chinese style dining. Lots of small tables crowded around the restaurant (small tables and large tables in the center). IT is definitely a very casual dining experience since there is a very \"rushed/quick\" eat type of feeling since you see the MASSIVE lineup and people crowding in the front entrance and hovering over the tables closest to the entrance. For a busy busy restaurant, it just feels really cramped if you sit near the entrance. 
I was fortunate enough to be able to sit at the side table closest to the entrance door--- so it wasn't as bad. However, there were still people standing and waiting for the table right next to me. 

Service: All the staff is busy taking orders and busy bringing items to the table. The food arrived really fast! As soon as the order was placed... I feel like the dish came in no time! 

Food:Lots of the typical Congee + Rice noodle rolls (what they are popular for) and other tradition snacks and drinks. Price point was good for the food!!
I came with hubby and we each ordered our own RIce Noodle Rolls. 
Rice noodle rolls: The starred item is what we ordered. The pork +beef  and beef+Chives+Shrimp was delicious. I love the soft rice noodle. it was so thin and smooth consistency. Not thick and doughy like some of the dim sum places. It is made perfectly and added with a little bit of the soy sauce which tasted really good!! 
We shared Lai Wan Style Congee--- They were really generous with the amount of fillings/ ingredient of squid. I feel like my whole bowl of congee was mostly squid (too much for me in my opinion because I didn't get a lot of other fish/meat ingredients). The congee was very smooth though. It was really well made! 
Though-- I can see myself completely just coming here for the Rice noodle rolls again. 

Frozen Milk tea: I ordered their \"frozen milk tea\".. I didn't know that it just meant that the milk tea was sitting in a bath of crushed ice to keep the tea Chilled. No ice was added in the milk tea so at least it didn't taste diluted at all. It was a good cup of milk tea but I think I can skip it next time. I was expecting more of \"frozen blend of hk milk tea\" but disappointed. 

Sweet fried dough: We ordered this but will SKIP next time. I didn't like how THICK it was. It was not light and airy like some other places that served the sweet fried dough. Will not order next time.

Fried dough sticks: Ordered this to go along with our congee, but not necessary for next time. 

Wait time: ERRRRRR this is the most annoying part. You gotta wait for GOOD FOOD!!! It was a SUNDAY late lunch --- probably close to 1pm to 1:30pm but I think we still waiting at least 30-40 minutes for a table. I was crazy hungry before we got there. Even after we got seated, there was no down time in the lineup. Constantly there's new people coming in for tables and asking for table numbers. Even after we finished our meal (took probably 20-25  minutes to finish eating, there was still a long lineup and this was close to 2-2:30 pm).   I don't think this place can go any faster and it is already running as efficiently as possible (quick food arrival and easy menu to choose from). It is just what you'll have to do to dine at a good place for yummy rice noodle rolls. 

Conclusion: I'd come back here for rice noodle!!! But.. I must see what other time is best to come to avoid the huge lineup/wait time and cramped style eating!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a huge fan of congee and \"noodle sausages\", but I couldn't stop eating the ones from here. Although the menu doesn't offer more than noodle sausages and congee, there are various combinations and flavours of the two. While prices are fairly reasonable, my one complaint was their lack of air conditioning. Depending on the time of day you go, you might need to wait in line in the heat for a considerable amount of time. I definitely recommend the mushroom noodle sausage and the pork liver congee."}
{"text":"Here's a restaurant that specializes in 1 thing so you hope they better do it well. 

Ordered a shrimp and a chicken cheung fun. They give you 1 giant dish size roll of cheung fun instead of 3 separate rolls like at dim sum restaurants. Nothing wrong with this if you're having it by yourself. It's a bit messy if you're going to share it. Both the shrimp and chicken had similar fillings, though I like the chicken one more. 

Slices fish congee is also pretty good. Fish pieces were generous in size. Order the fried dough stick as well. It's a perfect pairing with congee. 

This place is pretty busy if you come on a weekend noon time. Wait time probably would be max 15min or so since tables clear out pretty quickly"}
{"text":"long waits on weekends at least 15-20 minute wait. I would probably not wait any longer for the quality of food. You have to go up to the cash and get a number would recommend take out. I tried several rolls including the pork, fish, BBQ pork with the egg wrap and shrimp and beef. The egg wrap was nothing special, preferred the regular skin. The best one I would say is the beef and shrimp one. The skin is super smooth and soft. The milk tea, I thought was unique on ice however not worth the price. The congee was very watery and bland."}
{"text":"A fast casual congee and rice noodle roll place?  Yes please!

Running a day full of errands definitely creates an appetite and Yin Ji Chang Fen was asked to help us recharge our batteries.  The inside of the restaurant reminds me of the Hong Kong fast casual restaurants.  It looks clean, modern, and people are hustling in and out once they are done with their food.

We were hungry folks so we decided to go with one congee and 3 plates of rice noodle rolls to share between the two of us.  I took a look at the appetizers and didn't think they were good value for money (looking at you curry fish balls).

We got a beef, shrimp, and pork rice noodle roll to taste the staple items.  All three were portions were ample with plenty of filling inside.  It was smothered in that slightly sweet soy sauce.

The congee was a good consistency and it is a good partner for the slithery rice noodle roll pieces.  I was completely satisfied after the last spoon of congee and remaining piece of rice noodle roll was consumed.

It's Asian comfort food that is done with care and at an affordable price.  Normally, you would want to order one congee and one noodle roll which should satisfy any hunger."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and was super excited due to to many great reviews. We waited about 15 mins for a table for 2. Hot tea is served and you each get 1 napkin. We ordered 2 congee's (lean pork with century egg and fish), a shrimp chung fun and a dough fritter.  The chung fun was delish...smooth and silky. The congee and the dough stick was not so great. Msg loaded! Would only come back for the chung fun."}
{"text":"Is it worth the hype going around in the Chinese community? I think not. 

I came early on a Saturday morning. It was early enough that there was no line when we got there, but there was quite a line when we left. The line was so bad that I felt like I was in a zoo, and people waiting in line were watching the people who were eating. It's a small restaurant, and basically, the line blocked the door. Tables are small, so be careful with your personal belongings. It's tight, and I've had people spill stuff on my jackets before, so I kept my jacket on this time. 

Had a number of their congees, as well as a number of their rice noodle rolls. Everything is on the pricey side. The rice noodle rolls are good, and they're smoother than most other places, but enough so to justify the higher price point? I don't think so. We had a congee that was supposed to be pork, pig skin, and octopus, or something like that. I can't say they were wrong, but that pork was BBQ pork as in char siu. It was unusual. It was presented quite nicely though. They fried up an egg, omelette style, and cut it into slivers, then placed a bunch onto our congee along with the requisite fried noodles, cilantro, green onions, and peanuts. Their deep fried dough sticks and their deep fried donuts could be fresher and hotter. 

My recommendation: Go ahead and try it for the hype. Go early though to avoid the lines. For me, I'd rather go to a quieter, cheaper congee place."}
{"text":"The place was clean.  Service was quite quick.

Ordered the following:

Curry fish ball
Sticky rice 
Fried dough fritter
Steam rice roll with beef and shrimp 
Steam rice roll with fried dough fritter
Congee with minced beef added raw egg
Cold milk tea

Curry fish ball was tasty with some heat.  I wish it was more creamier and saucier.
Sticky rice I didn't get to try but my young kids ate it up
The steamed rice roll was a bit too thick than I'm used to and not as silky. So I found it so so.  I had high expectations so I was disappointed on the rolls.
Congee was tasty and good texture but I found they put too much cilantro.
My favourite was the milk tea but on the pricier side.

Overall if I want hk foods I would prefer to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"4 stars for the taste of congees, Chang fen, and milk tea.  Others are just average. Hope they will offer more items on the menu like noodles and vermicelli, roast pork/duck, etc. recommended by friend from Guangzhou."}
{"text":"After seeing this place pop up on various social media platforms, I decided to stop in with the BF for a late night snack. Originally wanting to go to T&T, Yin Ji Chang Fen to my surprise was in the same plaza and still open! 

Ordered the Ying Yang Rice rolls which was filled with pork, cilantro and fish filet. It was made fresh on the spot and piping hot in the container as we left with it in tow. The soy sauce that accompanied the roll was your tasty dipping soy sauce which for me, was authentic and tantalized my palette. As a meal/snack, you can eat this along with a congee and be full. They had other things on the menu ie congee, snacks, and about 12 other varieties of rice rolls. 

Price was just under $6 with tax for the rice roll. Value wise it was okay. Would be better if it was cheaper as these ingredients weren't of the highest quality. 
Missing the cheap breakfast you can get for 5 RMB in China :( 
I'm giving this review a 3 star is because of the rude server with short hair with some attitude that didn't fit being in customer service."}
{"text":"Great place to go if craving rice rolls. 

This place mainly sells only rice rolls and congee. Majority of dishes are around $4-5 each. The congee is nothing special, not much flavour to it but generous with the meat/shrimp. The rice rolls make up for this as it is the main attraction. Their rolls taste very savoury and fresh. Though they are drenched in soy sauce, it is not salty. The rice noodle is a lot thinner than the stuff I am used to from dim sum places. They are generous with the filling, so even though it seems a little lacking on the rice noodle each roll is decently filling enough. Feels pricey at  around $5 per roll, but the total bill comes up low enough, and it is a satisfying meal.

I agree with the rest of the reviewers that the service isn't that great, but it's not terrible. The food comes fairly quickly, all 5 dishes came within 5 minutes of ordering. It can be hard to get someone's attention. They don't leave a teapot on the table so you will have a hard time getting a refill. The tea does taste pretty great though."}
{"text":"This place is famous for their rice noodle (cheung fun) and their congee. Thats the only they really sell. They also sell Chinese fried donuts and milk teas. Their cheung fun (rice noodle) is different from the hong kong style ones. It is a tad more chewy and not as soft as I am used to. But that is just personal preference. Their congee is alright. Their fried donuts are alright.Their portions are not that big either. Service is fast and quite clean. Price is alittle bit more expensive compared to Sam's congee."}
{"text":"Food- 5. I love their rice noodle roll! Really smooth and tasty. Their congee is not as good as the rolls, too Guangzhou style. It taste like those congee hot pot, a little watery. 

Environment- 3, store is a bit small, always people waiting outside, too crowded, they dont have a waiting area."}
{"text":"The rice rolls and congee here are really good! Usually for rice rolls and congee, restaurants like to cheap out on the good stuff that's inside the dish like shrimp, chicken or beef - but not here! And because of that, the portions are actually quite good. Great place to drop by for a casual lunch or late night snack. I've gotten take out here a couple times and haven't been disappointed! I always order the shredded pork and egg congee and shrimp and beef rice rolls. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Service is dependent on the server. There was a girl who was quite nice but another older lady who wiped our tables didn't care too much with helping us. Cash only. Food is really good :)"}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
This place is bustling!! Kinda has that HK vibe going for it; space is limited, people are crammed up together, waiter & waitresses are zipping by and seem very much in a hurry.

Food
====
We ordered 3 variations of the stuffed noodles.

GET THE ONE WITH LIVER.  Not a lot of places get liver right, but this place does.  

We also ordered the one with fried dough and a signature with pork, shrimp and chives.

Delicious!

Will we be back?
=============
Yup, been back 3 times already!"}
{"text":"If you like dim sum like cheung fan this is the place  it's not a fancy place but doesn't matter you are there for the rice noodle the congee is great too love it service was good and place is clean will definitely go again there are quite a few snacks too like curry fish balls and law mic chicken yum"}
{"text":"For Rice Noodle & Congee Lovers, this would be their heaven! Unlike the typical rice noodles you see at normal dim sum restaurants, this place takes rice noodle to a different approach in making them nice & thin. Their congee also does not disappoint, they are loaded with ingredients so it actually fills you up (unlike other congee places where their congee is very watery & tasteless). I love ordering their pork liver & chives rice noodle (only if you're into intestines, otherwise,go for the beef rice noodle) & fish congee. The pork liver & chives rice noodle was flavourful, the liver wasn't too overwhelming. The fish congee I must say, is by far the best I've ever had, it is slightly marinaded with rice wine & did not fall apart (very big slices). If you plan to visit this place, try avoiding the lunch peak hours, as there's really not much room for you to stand inside."}
{"text":"I finally try this place and I love it!!!  

Even though it is quite busy,  I didn't have to wait for a table for the two times that I went but I guess it is because I went during the week.  I cannot imagine the huge crowds of line up over the weekend.  

I tried on my two visits: 

Shrimp and Beef Rice Roll / Cheung Fun
Beef Egg Roll Cheung Fun
Deep Fried Dough Rice Roll / Cheung Roll
Sticky Rice (Chang Chu Gai)
Lai Wan Congee (or Cheng Die Jok in Canto)
Pork and Century-old-egg Congee
Fried Dough
Sweet Crueller
Frozen Milk Tea 


The skin of the Cheung Fun is so smooth and silky. It is no wonder they are famous for them and totally deserve all the business.  I didn't particularly find the egg roll to be more tastier and I just ordered it to see how it would look like and taste.

I never liked any Beef Rice Roll served at Dim Sum, precisely y any dim sum that has beef rice rolls because the restaurants totally ruined the beef by adding in baking soda, cilantro etc. resulting in a very weird taste (and I love BEEF!)  Every time I go dim sum with my parents, they insist on ordering the beef rice roll and the beef steamed balls. I flatly refused to eat it and there always end up leftovers being they are too full to finish them. However, this place really does serve the best Beef Rice Roll as the beef is totally different! You actually see chunks of beef in your cheung fun, not some weird ground mixture!!  It is no wonder the prices they charged for their rolls are higher but it is worth it. 

I totally loved how all Cheung Fun always come as drenched in sweet soy sauce! I love soy sauce and drenching it into soy sauce is the best combination.

The Fried Dough Rice Roll was done nicely and it came with peanut sauce.  I wonder if you can get Hoisin sauce because it goes well too.

When it comes to congee, my first time trying their Lai Wan congee was not great. I expected not to be good but I was hoping that maybe, just maybe it would be better this time. It was totally pudgy... maybe not enough time for the ingredients and the congee to blend in together? 

The second time I went there, I ordered the Pork and Century-old-egg Congee and what a difference this time around. The congee was so smooth.  I was delighted. The congee isn't still as smooth as said Sam Delight''s or another place I tried but it was still good.  I am not sure if ordering the pork and century egg old congee made a difference.  Though it was smooth, I found the congee tasted plain so I kept adding in white pepper. However, good that I didn't feel thirsty afterwards so no MSG. 

I totally forgot to order the sticky rice the first time around so I made sure to order a plate. However I completed forgot about it and I was about to finish eating all my food. I asked the waitress to check on it. She came back five minutes later bringing me the sticky rice, explaining something about the the kitchen's paper not printing properly. The sticky rice (two small pieces) did come out piping hot. However, I felt it lacked fillings..You could barely see any toppings in the sticky rice. 

Deep Fried Dough is a must for your congee to dip it in but one of my dough was way overfried. 

Frozen Milk Tea tasted good but I find it quite pricey for just milk tea. 

Overall, a must try if you still haven't visited yet.

The place isn't too small but it isn't too big.  If you see a line up, don't despair as it is worth the wait :) Enjoy! :)

{"text":"If you're looking for Chinese comfort food, Yin Ji is your place to go.
Serving up some traditional Chinese breakfast/ brunch/ lazy food its got all you want.  From rice rolls and noodle soups to congee and Chinese street food eats. 
Jennifer and I came here one afternoon and did we come at the wrong time lol. The place was packed with people lined up to the door. 
When finally seated we dug into their menu.

Beef and shrimp rice roll to share, quick, easy, comfort food, it was delish!   Easy shareable dish for two.

Preserve egg and pork congee, portions were more than enough for two, lots of ingredients and thankfully it wasn't thick, like some places that use starch to thicken their congees up. 

Overall, this place is definitely a hit with locals looking for some good comfort Chinese food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has authentic and delicious \"Chang Fen\". We came here early in the morning and absolutely love this place! This place offers an array of rice rolls, congee and traditional Chinese breakfasts!  This is a must try for all Chinese foodies"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Friday morning after seeing the reviews on yelp and fb.. 

I would give this place an overall of 3.5. The setting was simple and the choices were not overwhelming... It is a unique place with somewhat quality food.. Too many places disappoint nowadays so when I run into a place that is \"OK\"...it's already considered to be good... 

We ordered a fish congee, shrimp chang fun, chicken and mushroom Chang fun and fried fritters....fish congee was 4.5/5...it was delish!! 

The Chang fun were mainly 3.5/5...as there was alot of ingredients inside and it was filling... 

Fried fritters were store brought, refried...a nice simple place for breakfast... 

$10/per person was a tad bit pricey for breakfast.. 

All in all,  a place I would come back without hesitation!"}
{"text":"We ordered the regular beef rice roll, chicken + mushroom rice roll, and the corn rice roll.

The beef rice roll tastes very plain/average; it was like your typical Chinese restaurant dim sum quality. But,  The chicken + mushroom and corn one did have flavour and it was tasty, you were able to tasty the ingredients. The corn rice roll was a surprise as it was sweet and salty, and somewhat refreshing. 

Overall, the portions was very small for the price. Our order totaled up to be around 15$ for 3 plates, and it was not filling at all. But, the rice roll was very smooth and the rice wrap was very thin.

Overall, i will not be coming back. but it was nice to try something new."}
{"text":"***  This review is written for the Gwai Lo's. If you are unsure if you're a gwai lo, ask one of your Chinese friends if you are :)  ***

Came here at 12pm on the weekend and there was quite a line up out the door.
\"ho fai, ho fai,\" the lady said. (\"very fast, very fast\" in Cantonese)
We're like, \"okay\"  and then timed it at 20 minutes to be seated.

\"Chang Fen\" means \"rice noodle roll\" in Mandarin. I'm used to calling it \"Cheung Fun\" in Cantonese. I'll just call it CF for short.

I thought to myself, this place better make good CF for them to have it in their name.

Their CF feels very much like the ones you'd get at dim sum, but there's something noticeably different.  This resto makes them in 2 pieces but wider, whereas dim sum CF makes them in 3 pieces but smaller. You'd still eat them the same way, by firstly pouring the supplied sweet light soy sauce over the CF.

Even the contents of the CF were a cut above. The beef one did not have CILANTRO, which is huge for some people, and better cuts of beef than at dim sum. 
I didn't really care for the shrimp CF. The shrimps were too small for the volume of rice noodle, IMO.

We also had the pork and century-old-egg congee. It was a bit on the salty side (again, good for gwai lo taste, i've noticed.)  BTW, if you like century-old egg, then try to not get the ones that were made in China. The chemicals they use are too risky for human consumption. Since you can never tell at a restaurant, I try to limit it greatly if its source is unknown.

Lastly, it's at the same plaza as T&T at Warden & Steeles. This resto is on the warden-facing side. There's free plaza lot parking but it can be crazy during peak times. I don't like coming to this T&T plaza during peak... it's that bad sometimes.

Overall, I recommend them. Gotta try their beef CF!  Next time, I'll try their egg-infused in their CF."}
{"text":"I understand why this place is famous for their steamed rice rolls!

I've tried so many of them I don't even remember all of the details, but all of them were very good. It's a bit more expensive than getting them at dim sum, but they are worth a try. Especially if you like steamed rice rolls! The rolls are thicker than the ones at dim sum and have a really nice texture.

The congee however, is either way too salty or way too bland depending on when you go. They are always busy, but as a restaurant they should be able to handle the diners and food and bring out a consistent product...

The waitresses are very rude, too. The service is bad even for a Chinese restaurant, but people come here for the food, not the service!

4/5 for the steamed rice rolls
2/5 for the congee"}
{"text":"I LOVE rice rolls. I can't believe there is finally a place that is dedicated to rice rolls. I discovered this restaurant through browsing yelp. I was so excited to come and I'm surprised it is open till midnight. I usually get rice rolls for breakfast, or a side dish during dinner time. 

I came around 10pm on a weekday. It was extremely loud, because there were some drunk people in the restaurant. If you do come at night, do expect that this place could get rowdy since it is open late so it is convenient for people to come grab food after having drinks. 

Service: 

Service was quick. It was not friendly and I don't think they strive to offer friendly service. It was rather rushed. 

Food: 

Shrimp with chives- I loved the texture of the rice roll, it was very smooth. 

Beef with chives (with egg) - I don't think I am a fan of the egg on rice roll. This is my first time having this texture, I have never seen this kind of rice roll before. I don't think I will order it again. It wasn't bad, but I prefer the normal rice roll texture without adding the egg.

Overall:

I will definitely come back and this will be my go-to spot whenever I have cravings for rice rolls."}
{"text":"A cozy menu and cozy area for some congee and rice rolls. Decided to come to this restaurant after waking up and craving for some congee. Overall the taste of the food was average, what really stood out was their rice rolls. Very flavourful, the soy sauce was sweet."}
{"text":"The weekend brunch vibe is amazing there are a lot of people there's the buzzling if that's what you like and dishes are coming out fast! when you're surrounded by a plethora variations of chang fen how can you not be satisfied?"}
{"text":"I love this place for Chang Fen, and I've come here often. The shrimp and beef ones are the best, and you can add egg to them too. I also get one of their congee just so I can eat the fried dough sticks with them (you tiao). I can't recommend it enough, so crispy! Everything is so fresh and perfectly made.

The service is fast, it's cheap and filling. You can't go wrong with this place, both Cantonese locals and my non-Asian coworkers have enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best congee and rice rolls in town.  There's always a wait though. They should open another location."}
{"text":"My go to place for congee and chang fen. Space is really tight and it is busy during mornings and brunch hours but the service is quick and tables turn around quickly. You are given a sheet of paper to write down your orders. 

The congee is always fluffy, and they never skimp on ingredients (eg meats, seafood). I usually request more green onions and cilantro at no extra costs. The chang fen is different than the thinner rolls you get at dim sum - it's one big roll. I personally really enjoy the combination of the tender pork/beef with some greens in the chang fen with their sweet soy sauce drizzled on top. You can't go wrong when you try the recommended dishes on the menu. Not my personal favourite because I like the silky texture of the chang fen, but certainly fun to try is to request an egg with your chang fen where the chef cracks an egg onto the thin wrap to incorporate it into the roll before wrapping the ingredients! Also tried the chang fen that is wrapped around the Chinese pastry (Yau cha gwai) but it just all ends up being soggy - I'd stick with ordering these at dim sum places instead. Their spicy curry fish balls are evenly coated in the spicy sauce, definitely gives your mouth a slight burn but nothing overwhelmingly spicy.

During the summer, lots of people order their milk tea that is served in a plastic container, sitting in a bowl of ice. You'd get nice cold milk tea that wouldn't get diluted with ice over time but it costs several times the more than a typical iced milk tea served in this type of cafe. I'm happy sticking with regular iced milk tea since I finish it during the meal anyway, or their iced lemon ribena - yum!"}
{"text":"Happy to find another congee place! Last call at 11:30pm.

Tried the Shrimp Rice Roll & Beef Rice Roll. Silky & smooth, comes in one whole sheet. Eat this first 'cause it gets cold pretty fast. 

Meanwhile the congee retains its piping hot temperature throughout the meal. I tried the Minced Beef Congee and Fish Congee - both proteins have a relatively rougher texture compared to other congee places in the area.

Overall good congee & rice roll at good price! (~$5/item) I will be back.

*Cash Only*"}
{"text":"I don't get some of the bad review here.  Yes service is not the best, but it's a hole in the wall restaurant, not to mention a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant.  I'm used to minimal service since that's the norm in NY Chinatown.  The food here is amazing and it's how fresh made churn fun should be.  If you want thick doughy churn fun that's massed produced at dim sum restaurants then this is not for you and you do not know churn fun and shouldn't be writing this review.  It's like saying oh the dumpling skin at a dumpling shop is too thin, I prefer the Chinese take out dumpling with thick doughy skin.  Get it?  The churn fun was amazing, the chicken and pork in it is very tender.  I like how they added lettuce to it so there's bit more texture and a light sweet taste.  The congee is the perfect texture of thickness, not too watery.  It's even better than Congee Village in NYC.  The fried dough is the perfect crunch and flavor.  Overall if you want good food go here.  If you want 5 star service for a fast meal don't bother."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Dim Sum, especially Chang Fen (rice roll). Yin Ji Chang Fen is the chain store from Guangzhou, China. Growing up in Guanzhou, I have to say this is the typical texture and taste of rice roll! It reminded me of the old times! It is highly recommended and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a five star if it weren't for its wait time and lack of waiting area. We went on a scorching hot day and we had to wait either outside or in the tiny area outside the main entrance that has no AC. The food was great though. I'd like to taste more of the rice rolls but I think their idea is to have the thinnest rice roll as possible."}
{"text":"I love cheong fun and I was beyond excited to hear Yin Ji was opening a location in Markham.  To start, this is not like your typical cheong fun to get at dim sum - instead of a rice noodle wrapper wrapped tightly around the filling and typically coming in 3 'logs', it's like the wrapper is 'folded' around the filling.  It may be unusual for some expecting dim sum style cheong fun, but both styles are pretty common in Hong Kong / Ghangzhou.

The dishes are relatively pricey (~$5) but it's a fair portion for the rice rolls and the filling is really good.  Varieties include marinated beef, marinated pork, mushroom and shrimp.  IIRC, it's +$1 to add egg to rice noodle - interesting, but I prefer the regular style.

In short, for cheong fun, you're looking for 'waat' (Cantonese) as the measure of quality.  Roughly meaning 'smooth & slippery' and there's no English equivalent for this term (like 'umami').  The rice rolls at Yin Ji has this in spades.

Finally, it's open until 12 every day and it makes for a great late night snack.  It's a damned winner."}
{"text":"Normal rice noodle rolls and congee, nothing special and pretty average.  From a technical standpoint, the noodle wrapper is just sub par while the fillings are on point.  Sam's Congee is one level above in both categories to be honest."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday. It was busy already. Understandable, but standing at the door waiting to get a number to be seated took forever. There was nobody to check the door for new customers until I had to call out at them! Got my seat at the corner beside the door, because of the amount of people waiting at the door, it was EVEN harder to get the waitress attention. That is the worst spot to be seated at. Food came very late, it did not taste the way how it should be, not just food! Even the drinks were bad! Not coming back again! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"While there was a huge lineup located at Warden & Steeles--parking was sure hard to find. Found it did not quite live up to its hype. The prices were around $2 more expensive than other similar places which I am not sure why since it was not that extraordinary.

Let's talk food:

R1 Marinated beef and shrimp with chives rice roll ($5.75) - Nothing very special though it was said this store's received an award for it. It did have firmer rice roll skin and didn't fall apart when picked up with a chopstick, but fairly meh.

R4 Shrimp with Chives Rice Roll ($5.00) - Again, nothing too outstanding. I didn't quite like the veggies since it gave the rice a weird grass taste to it. I also think it is some kind of lettuce instead of chive; plain shrimp would had probably been better. The sweet soy sauce does make it tastier. Don't forget to add in sesame sauce, hoi sin sauce, and sesame seeds--big bad 3 for better taste.

C2 Fresh beef sliced congee ($5.50) - Nothing special, though it became very watery when cooled down. 

C5 Lai wan style assorted congee ($5.50) - It had squid tentacles, peanuts, and tilapia fish slices in it. Found the tilapia tasted muddy (as expected as a detritus-eating fish), but somehow the mud tasted very profound in the congee. I think they should have blanched it with chives and ginger to rid it. 

D1 Hong Kong Style milktea ($2.25) - The cup was around 250 mL which was quite small compared to other places. It tasted no different from regular milk tea, yet the price was quite high.

Liked this place and noticed they do have better customer service and more variety to choose from. Despite such, one could have received the same quality and deliciousness at Sam's Congee Delight for less (even though Sam's doesn't have fantastic customer service). I liked it, but probably wouldn't choose this as my go-to.

Forgot to mention that they return your change in a way that enables them to receive a tip greater than 10%? That's crafty!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came here for lunch.  My coworker ordered pork blood congee (???)and a shrimp rice roll.  I ordered a thousand year egg and pork congee (?????) and a plain rice roll.  She compared her food to Sam's Congee's and liked Sam's version better.  She liked that there were many pieces of pork blood in the congee at Yin Ji; yet she liked the smoothness of Sam's congee more.  She liked how big Yin Ji's shrimp rice roll was, yet the shrimps were overcooked.  I liked Yin Ji's congee over Sam's, because here's was more substantial as a lunch.  I also liked that there was very little MSG in Yin Ji's congee.  My opinion of the rice roll was unfortunately less enthusiastic.  Here is the thing: without the distraction of the filling, the texture of a plain rice roll is on full display and any minor imperfection has no place to hide.  The plain rice roll just wasn't as silky as I liked."}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in rice noodle rolls and congee. There is usually a wait but turnaround time is quick. We have tried the Pork and Gold Preserved Egg and Shrimp Congee, both were great and generous with the toppings. We also tried the following rice noodle rolls: Beef and shrimp with chives, egg, marinated beef, BBQ pork and chicken. The rice noodle rolls that stood out for me was the egg because it added a nice texture but I would have it with another topping. Also the BBQ Pork, beed and pork and shrimp were delicious. We ordered the curry fish balls but not worth it for $5.25 for 2 skewers with 4 balls on each."}
{"text":"There are a few problems with this restaurants:
1) The way they put bunch of chop sticks on the table is so unsanitary. They are exposed to coughing, spit.  For this reason I will not go back.

2) I order R11 Dough Stick Roll,  I can tell dough was fried long ago.  There was no sesame seeds on the roll, no dipping sauce.  When I asked for it, waitress gave a entire bottle of sesame seeds.   That means they are not well trained.  I suppose this is a new restaurant so process is not in place.

3) On the menu, it says congee cooking time is 15 minutes. Heat  up congee should not take that long.  I would expect congee to come first , rice stick roll would take longer.   But congee came after I finished rice stick roll. 

I give it a one star for being reasonable priced."}
{"text":"When I first heard that Yin Ji opened in Toronto, I knew I had to make a trip out here because I've always had it in Guangzhou and never in North America. Their congee and chang fen were so good. It made me miss China even more! I had the pork and beef chang fen, pork liver congee, seafood congee, pork and shrimp chang fen, and pork chang fen by itself. We ordered enough to share because we had other food plans afterwards. The chang fen was super smooth and soft. I thought their soy sauce was a little too salty, but I was fine with it since I don't get to eat it often. This place definitely satisfied my cravings for chang fen and congee. They open super late too, so next time I might just grab late night when I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese rice noodle roll, but not worth the price. 

My family ordered about 6 different plates of rice noodle rolls to drive between the 4 of us, and as someone who immigrated from the Southern part of China, we could definitely say this reminded us of home. However, the price of $5+ per dish wasn't worth it, given how cheap the ingredients cost to make rice rolls. 

We also ordered some appetizers such as chicken rice dumplings and curry fish balls. The curry fish balls were a little bit spicy but the flavour was good. The chicken rice dumplings were absolutely terrible that it tasted stale and we didn't want to touch it again after taking our first bite!!!

Even though it was nice to taste rice noodle rolls as authentic as those back home, it wasn't worth the value for me to want to come back again."}
{"text":"Cantonese style rice noddle rolls and congee is what they are known for. Really smooth rice noodles with a variety of filling options. I had the standard shrimp with chives, if you like shrimp and chives, it's a good bet you'll enjoy it. The congee was okay but nothing spectacular. The consistency was good and it was served piping hot, almost burned my tongue. Taste is okay. The rice noodle rolls are the star in my opinion. Usually a late night snack item, this place is open pretty late (until midnight?). Next time I definitely want to try the egg mixed into the steamed rice rolls. Makes a great snack, this place is busy at lunch time but turn over is pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Great place for congee and rice rolls. The curry fish balls are nothing special, but the stick rice was really good. This would be great place for breakfast. 

This place fills up fast so be prepared to share tables and its CASH only."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and I can tell you they have the best rice cake so far in Toronto.  We ordered rice cake , lean pork congee with preserved eggs, lotus leaf rice, buns with condense milk, and deep fried bread stick.  All freshly made.  The rice cake skin flour was very thin and smooth.  The fried bread stick is fresh and hot.  They all came out relatively together which is what I expected.  Overall it is a very good restaurant but seats are limited.  I definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Every time I have dimsum I always order 2 plates of rice noodles for myself. Now I have found my new place for a variety of different flavours of rice noodles! The beef and shrimp roll and chicken and mushroom roll are a definite recommendation with their provided chili oil. I also suggest trying their pork and preserved egg congee. There's something about the pork in the congee that's sooo addictive! I even got two extra order of congee to go. The HK milk tea was nothing great. Quite water down but it's okay. I came for the rolls and I got the rolls! Loved this place and great service. How many Chinese restaurants actually offer good services these days?"}
{"text":"This is 85% carb, 15% protein kind of restaurant!

Hyped-up.  Totally.

Ordered:
Congee/fish ball/4 types of rice noodles.

Don't come here for dinner.
Breakfast/lunch only.

Nothing special about them, don't know how they got all the accolades."}
{"text":"Chun fun so delicious,  so smooth and thin.  Just as good as Hong Kong!  Jook is yummy.  Milk tea is thick and potent.  Not water drown. This the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 3 stars because the Cheung Fun was SOOO good!

Cold milk tea = good
Curry fishballs = not good
Congee = decent

What really brought the rating to 3 stars only is because we waited 45 MINS for our congee to come. ONE bowl of congee. We had to flag down two employees and had one ask when she noticed us just sitting there.

Congee, no matter what kind, we got the Pork Liver one, does NOT take 45 mins. It upset us cause the lady we first flagged down DIDN'T even check the system cause OBVIOUSLY it wasn't entered! My bf watched her after we asked about the congee and she gave us the excuse about how it takes longer to cook our pork liver. 

Anyway, the place isn't small but it ain't huge. Turnover is quick, so wait time isn't horrible. It gets super busy and I doubt they care about customer service with so many people squeezing through the doors.

Still. 

It wasn't a good experience for us. It wasn't good business for them either since we were there for a WHOLE HOUR."}
{"text":"???????????? ????????????The congee base is good. The chang fen I prefer the Hong Kong style more. Though this place still is smooth rice batter but not much rice aroma."}
{"text":"Came at 11:40 on a Saturday. A famous restaurant from china. I tried the fish congee and the rice rolls. I honestly don't know why the hype is about. The congee was a bit too watery for my taste. The rice rolls were alright. Comparable to the one in midland and mcnicole food court. There was not enough soy sauce on them. I had to request more.

Lined up around 20+ mins. Price wise it's okay. For 2 ppl one bowl of congee two rice rolls came to $18 including tips. Most likely go if there's only no line up. Other wise won't go."}
{"text":"A whole place dedicated to Cheung Fun? A favourite and we were so excited. :)

Arrived around 1015AM on a Saturday (Canada Day) and there was already a line-up. Only took about 15 minutes to get seated, so not bad.

Seated at a sticky table with tasteless tea to start. I got something wet spilled on my foot when they cleared the table beside us
\"It's all over my foot\"
\"No it's not\"
\"I need napkins\"
(The other server apologized when I called her back to take away the wet/dirty napkins I had used to wipe my feet.)

We ordered three different kinds of Cheung fun and a bowl of congee. We knew we wouldn't finish it all, but wanted variety. The congee was good, but not as good as a Congee Wong for example.

The Cheung fun:
Really liked the thin noodles
Thin noodles unfortunately meant floppy and sloppy
The dough fritter was nice and crunchy
The char siu was salty, not at all sweet and meh
The shrimp was okay
The travesty though was the cooked lettuce inside the shrimp Cheung fun. I find cooked lettuce revolting, have never had it in cheung fun, and the menu only mentioned the usual chives.

The overall two rating comes down to service and the fact that I have had better Cheung fun at dim sum places that I have rated three stars. I am glad that we tried this place, but it won't be a repeat for me."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Rice Roll is made fresh so it's good, but it is not the traditional chinese version, or maybe not the HK version. I like the HK version better personally but as long as they make it fresh, they all taste good to ppl.

One good thing about their congee is that they are super hot. This is a plus because congee needs to eat it hot, but they are not surprisingly good. The seafood congee isn't the traditional one too. The traditional one have minced meat and different kind of seafood but this one have pork slices. I guess it's faster for them to make cuz they just put in all the ingredients and put hot congee over them, but doesn't have the traditional taste and they shouldn't be called the same traditional name on their menu.

Overall, it's good fast rice roll. I guess it's good for a nice snacks...."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great rice rolls and great prices!! I came here for lunch and ordered the soy sauce beef rice roll, chicken congee and deep fried dough. The beef rice rolls were delicious! The rice roll wrap is thin, delicate and smooth and inside is packed with a lot of ingredients. The congee and deep fried dough were just average though. What we ordered was enough to feed two for lunch. Came out to $13.75 before tax! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I was born and raised in Guangzhou and Yin Ji is a household name in our city - literally as well known as McDonald's so needless to say I was super stoked to see them come to Toronto.

I didn't go during the first couple months of opening, as I was told the line-ups are insane. I finally went recently and I can see why there's the hype.

The decor is simple, with a few photos of the old GZ. I loved how you can add eggs to your chang fen just like back home. The congee and chang fen were good but what you need to order is their ICED MILK TEA. It was so good I ordered a 2nd one.

This is a great place to eat a quick and light meal. I come here almost every time I am in the area now, either for a small bite or a full meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 9pm, didn't have to wait for a table. Ordered the sticky rice in leaf and a bunch of rice rolls. Sticky rice was good but nothing too special, but the rice rolls are the best in town. Pricier than your typical dim sum rice rolls but definitely worth it. Tastes just like in Guangzhou. If you like rice rolls, then this place is a must."}
{"text":"Chang fen are good. I like the one with pork and beef. I added egg and it tastes pretty good. Cheap and fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Clean little place in warden and steeles area. Waited for almost 20 minutes on a sunday lunch. People are lining up outside waiting for their number to be called.

Ordered the beef and shrimp rice noodle roll, pork and chives rice noodle roll, beed rice noodle roll with extra egg, sticky rice, pork and century egg congee and pork, liver, kidney congee. Everything tasted very good. With the choice of extra egg on the rice noodle, they just wrapped another layer of egg around the rice noodle roll. The sauce taste just right.

Service is good and servers are friendly. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"My go to place for comfort food. The rolls are delightful but definitely should be eaten fast as they get cold very quickly. 

My recommended meal for two:
1) 2 rolls (all of them are delicious) and add egg to get that something extra. 
2) 1 congee (my favourite are the preserved egg and pork congee or the sliced beef congee) 
3) deep fried dough fritter to share and dip. 

$25. What a deal. 

It is however a very busy place so best bets are going off hours or even getting takeout."}
{"text":"Mehhhhh according to my 98-year-old Chinese grandmother.

There are only three vegetarian options - dough fritter, corn, mixed vegetables - for the rice rolls and one of them includes cooked lettuce. Ewww. Really, why!?!? The rolls are large flat pieces rather than the traditional strips that I am used to. Different style and more difficult to split and pick up with your chopsticks.

Service is fast and prompt. Some servers speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. They were accommodating too and polite. 

Busy at lunch but Gramma said that the prices are much higher and the quality isn't even as good as her favourite dim sum place. They also seem frugal with the soy sauce as they didn't put out bottles on each table. There was only chili sauce, white pepper and sugar (for Hong Kong milk tea).

Overall, I understand why this place is popular. It's clean, it's fast and its menu is simple. The hours are crazy, from 8 am to midnight. I'd come back if I wanted a snack when it's not packed but likely this would not be a place I'd frequent."}
{"text":"Confused on why the average yelp rating for this place is low. The food is priced on the cheaper side. Service is fast. Awesome for the price that I'm paying.

There are a few items on the menu with a thumb up beside them marked as chefs recommendation. Ordered from this list to stay safe and ordered a mixed seafood congee.

The filling inside the rice paper roll is generous with just the right amount of soy sauce on top. If you are into a bit more salty taste, there's no soy sauce in the table as a FYI.

Liked my rice paper roll with chicken and mushroom better than chives and shrimp."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout at 10am: marinated beef and chives noodle roll

Got my order in less than 5 mins!!! Impressed. The roll came nicely packaged and had napkins + chopsticks + a generous portion of delicious sweet soy sauce
 I was surprised to find that it was actually one large roll and not the 3 smaller ones you get at dim sum. I didn't like this because it was harder to eat. Wish I had a knife.
Honestly did not like the marinated beef so much because the dish didn't feel right... Tasted like regular stir fry beef but in a noodle roll. It was however very tender. I also found that the noodle was thinner than dimsum. The top is one layer so you can see the colour of the meat and chives through it. All the thick parts of the noodle is on the bottom. That's nice presentation.
Overall I would come back to try something else. The food is a average priced (kind of expensive, nice treat for me) but worth because delicious."}
{"text":"When one is craving a late night snack what's the first thing that comes to mind?  Burgers?  Nope.  Wings?  Nope.  Rice Rolls and Congee?  Of course!

Decided to try this place out as it closes at midnight and noticed a lot of reviews recently.  Yin Ji Chang Fen is a rice roll franchise from Guong Zhou and this is apparently the first location outside the motherland.  The menu basically consists of rice rolls, congee and a few other things so quite small but sometimes small is good.

I have to admit we really enjoyed the rice rolls here.  The rolls are thin and the filling delicious.  Much better then ones served in most dim sum places.  The one that absolutely stood out for me was the beef ones as they filling is made with velveted sliced beef not ground beef.  The great thing about these rolls you can add extra meat and even egg to the rolls.  Soooooo gooooood!!!!

The congee was very enjoyable as it was more home style rather then the one you get at places like Congee Queen.

Price point is fantastic as everything is $5 or under.  Service was quick too so a great place to grab either breakfast as they open at 8am or a late night snack like us as they close at midnight.

Overall will definitely be back as we would love to try the other rolls and congee on the menu.  A solid 4 outta 5 from me on these rolls baby!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and pretty price! Also has good (long) hours of operation! Would return and recommend to others!!"}
{"text":"Note:  Review is based on takeout for a coupla cheung fun.  I really wanted the fried doughnut wrapped in rice noodle, but didn't get it because it wouldn't taste good unless eaten right away.

Yin Ji is in a plaza just in front of the T&T, so it is a bit awkward to access if you're headed towards Pacmall.

The restaurant is the same kinda deal as Sam's Congee Delight, except in newer plaza with more \"snacks\" on the menu.  Tbh, cheung fun are probably best to be enjoyed dine-in at the restaurant.  What I noticed when I ate them at home is that they weren't wrapped evenly.  So I'd get a wad of rice noodle with nothing, then beef towards 1 side of the roll.  That was my only complaint + it's not a super quick place, unlike more of these places.

Doing take out took approx. 10-15mins after ordering, so keep that in mind!  I'll go back for the dine-in experience and Chinese doughnut in cheung fun."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon to see what the hype was about... first franchise from Guangzhou to open in Toronto. 

Parking was extremely hard to find in this plaza during lunch time. I would advise you to take the first spot you find. 

As the restaurant is still relatively new, there was a long wait time. Expect to wait for more than 15 minutes during prime time. 

There are only a couple other restaurants in the GTA that offers this type of Rice Roll (Chang Fun). And this restaurant definitely had the best dining experience out of the lot. 

I found the Rice Rolls to be delicious and filling. Would recommend you add additional egg topping to all Rice Roll orders for an additional $1. 

The Congee on the other hand was a bit bland and needed additional pepper. The portions are quite large and can be shared between two people. 

For a party of two, I would suggest one order of Congee, two different Rice rolls and an order of sticky rice wrap to share. 

Seating was a bit tight, however the service was quick and efficient. 

Will definitely be returning when it is less busy."}
{"text":"This joint is surprisingly clean and modern looking for a traditional classic Chinese eatery. The chang fen is delicious -t around $5 a plate. 
Not munch else to say as the menu consists of mainly Chang fen and some congee."}
{"text":"This is a very focused restaurant with a very specific menu. There are many variations of filling and toppings but there are basically two main items: rice noodle rolls and congee. Both are done very well. 

The congee is smooth and comes out piping hot. It takes approximately 10-15 mins for them to make it and bring it out to you. The rice noodle rolls are delicious, light and made to order. I've tried various fillings and would say that the one with the fried dough is probably my least favourite rice noodle role here. I wish it was better because it's typically my favourite filling. Beef, shrimp, pork variations are all good. I don't recommend adding the egg to the rice noodle as it takes away from the texture. Just as-is is perfect. 

Service is typical of a low/well priced Chinese restaurant. The wait times can be a bit long but worth it."}
{"text":"Rice rolls is what this place is all about, smooth and silky, congee base was very tasty, a little bit different from the Hong Kong style, the soy sauce is a nice balance, overall it is pretty good, the kitchen needs to work a little bit faster, seems like it took longer than normal for this type of restaurant, service was swift."}
{"text":"Came by for a mid-morning snack the other day and it was a hot and sweaty experience...just like Southeast Asia! The queue for a table took ~15 minutes and A/C was minimal inside the restaurant.

Ordered the beef rice noodle crepe along with the rice noodle wrapped in fried dough which were both decent.

Staff seemed rather frazzled. With the unbearable heat in the restaurant, the dining experience was uncomfortable..

."}
{"text":"First time here and either I'm having a bad day or the short order cook is. The food is mediocre at best. Sorry I don't cook worth sh**... But I can do better.

The staff are friendly and greet you as soon as you come in. The place is small and the only problem is that the center tables are subject to the cold (or hot) air blasting in when patrons come in. Request for a table on the side if your sensitive to either. Didn't bother me as I'm originally from colder climates. :) Plus it did help cool off the congee a bit. 

Now the food... Nothing exceptional so I don't know how they got their best asian food award  for 2017 (at least that's what the bright yellow sign in the front stated).  The rice rolls were more like thick rice omelettes, not rolls. Unless you like calling a slab that is 2x6 a cheun fun. 

Pretty disappointed with the other stuff I had. Again, either a bad day for me or the short order cook was off the game. 

(Apologies for the late review, been rather busy lately)"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side considering what you're getting, but I keep coming back for more. The congee is always hot and they don't skimp on the add ins. The rice noodles are very fresh and smooth and pair well with their chili oil. The cold milk tea is kept in the fridge so that it doesn't have to be served with ice which dilutes your drink!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????q?????????????????????????
????????????
????d??????????????

??????feel?d???????????????????"}
{"text":"I expected more from this place after seeing it on BlogTO.  They do have a good selection of Chang Fen and congee.  However, I had better at different dim sum restaurants in the city.  I usually love to order the Chang Fen with the Chinese donut inside and I gotta say that is the worse Jai Lern I have ever had.  I did drive all the way from downtown to try this and I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I have heard people raving about this place, but the parking situation at the Warden T&T plaza always stops me from coming - must avoid coming here during rush hours! Finally decided to go one night and battled for a spot right in front of the restaurant *victory sign* lol.

Our group of 6 got tons of snacks, a few bowls of congee, and of course, their signature steamed rice rolls (chang fen) to share.

Congee comes out pipping hot, the taste is up to par in my books *thumbs up* but I do prefer my congee thicker though ;) The dough stick, sweet cruller, and deep fried peanuts pair really well with the congee. I'm also glad that they have deep fried fish skin... which I rarely see in restaurants. It is crispy, not seasoned, tastes good with congee, but also enjoyable on its on (like chips!). I would also recommend the deep fried steam bun with condense milk - very tasty!

I didn't find the steam rice rolls (chang fen) to be as special (sorry!) I have high expectations when it comes to chang fen because it is an item I particularly enjoy since I was young. The tastier ones I've had were at Yummy Cantonese Restaurant (Toronto), and at Shangri-la Banquet Hall (Markham).

I don't think I would track all the way down from Aurora to Yin Ji just for the chang fen. But if a friend insist on coming here for food, I would come back again for their delicious Asian snacks!"}
{"text":"This place use to be jam packed so I decided to wait until the hype died down so I can give this place a try. Honestly I wish I didn't wait so long because this is now my favorite place to get rice noodles. Hand made rice noodles in house and the portions are huge and tasty. It's not salty at all. The flavors just right! Congee is also served in a big bowl and they don't mind if you ask for customizations on what you like inside of your congee. Everytime I come here I always have to order the milk tea as well because it's absolutely phenomenal! Customer service is also great. Reminder that it's cash only."}
{"text":"I would can choose half point. I think it worths a 3.5/5.
Steamed rice rolls and congee is a things for me. I would sometimes go to Sam's congee on my own when I'm craving for this kind of food.  Finally there's another restaurant open so i must go try!  
Rice rolls were really good and there are quite a few choices of the flavor but I find that the portion is small for its price. We ordered the beef and chives one and a vegetarian one.  I prefer the one with meat as I felt the vegetarian one more greasy.
Congee is more like a home style cooking  which actually is not bad but could be better. 
I also ordered their so called \"recommended \" HK style cold milk tea. They put the already pre-prepared milk tea inside the fridge.  When served, they put the whole cup on a bowl of ice. Idea is not to water down the drink when the ice melt. However their milk tea is not the best. Way too creamy which I found that covering up the tea flavor. $4.99 (if I'm not mistaken with the price), I would never order again.  
But for their rice rolls I will be back!"}
{"text":"the yinji rice noodle roll brings me back to guangzhou lol?the best chang fen in toronto?a must try place?also the milk tea was amazing?i will come back for sure?the down side is sometimes you need to wait a bit to be seated?but it worth it?"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was impressed! For anyone like me make sure you bring cash woth you they only accept cash!

The good
- Cheap cheap cheap...great budget meal that is both filling and delicious.
- Food comes very quickly!
- Plastic chopsticks that are steam cleaned..very environmentally friendly.
- Clean place 

The bad
- Only accept cash...cone on it's 2018!
- Congee was covered in cilantro...yuck!
- English is limited...would helo if servers could speak with everyone.
- Seating is tight.
-Customer service is what you'd imagine for an Asian hole in the wall spot.
- Parking is tight."}
{"text":"Great Chang fen or rice noodle rolls but average, at first, congee. The rice noodle rolls are smooth and silky, just like something you'd get from Hong Kong. We ordered the shrimp and mushroom roll, both of which were pretty tasty. The congee tastes all the same, as if they just took the same congee base and just added toppings. After returning home however and reheating the leftovers, I concluded that their congee is actually pretty well made with quality produce. The menu is limited and parking is difficult. They are located at the T&T plaza. I would come back. The service was good and the Chang fen selection provided good variety."}
{"text":"Please don't come to places like this looking for service. It's just about the food! They don't speak English very well but that's okay because the food is stellar. So simple and so delicious. The menus have pictures and English descriptions. The rice noodles are light and delicate, not thick and chewy like at dimsum. The best was the pork & shrimp. Honestly, you could put anything in between a fresh rice noodle like this and it might be delicious!"}
{"text":"My mother-in-law (bless her wonderful taste buds) introduced us to this place on the early months that opened. It's now one of our favourite places to order from. She warned us of the long lines so we always steered clear  of rush hours or simply called in for take out. They wisely added small shreds of ginger to their congee to bring out the grains' fragrance. Not a lot of people likes the taste of ginger and they cut theirs so thin you wouldn't notice it. (smart). We always get the Pork Congee with the preserved egg ; matched with the Shrimp and Chives rice noodle and sometimes include the dough fritter. I order these every time , I can call it my staples. My son LOVES the Rice Noodle Roll. Our growing collection of the black containers occupying my cupboard is a testament to this. The fact that it has loads and loads of greens and he still loves eating it without leaving anything out is another amazing thing. I think its because the skin on this roll is made so thin making the texture light on the palate. 

Coming here on a Saturday at 2PM the place was crazy packed, with people just by door waiting to be seated. While waiting for my take out, I was able to observe service was quick and efficient. Literally this is fast food minus the grease. Would be doing a repeat of course."}
{"text":"This place is super popular and I can see why! 

We had a bit of a wait when we got there but after only maybe 5-10 minutes, we were seated. The place is small so be prepared to be touching elbows with the table next to yours, but it's the food that we came here for, not so much the ambiance. 

We ordered three different kinds of the chang fen, the char siew, beef and shrimp and just shrimp and they were all good. Our favourite was the shrimp, the simpler the better for me. We also got the deep fried dough with condensed milk and it was amazing, sweet and crunchy and just wonderful. The chang fen are a bit more money than a regular dim sum place, around $3-5 or so, but it's a lot larger in portion size and quite a bit tastier. The soy sauce was the perfect amount of sweet and savory.

The restaurant itself is clean enough and, again, it's small but they do manage to pack a bunch of people in there and it turns around very quickly. 

I found the service to be good! We got our food quickly and we even ordered some to go and we got that near the end of our meal so it worked out nicely. This is a nice substitute for dim sum if you just feel like the rice noodles and maybe some congee, especially on a cold day, this would be perfect!"}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE FOR RICE NOODLES, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. Dined in for the most delightful, splendid rice noodles a person could ask for. Restaurant was pretty busy but our server was so attentive and sweet. When the food hit our table we savored our food in silence. So happy with this restaurant!

Our order:
- Egg rice noodle - if you want to challenge yourself once a day then challenge yourself to order this unusual scrambled egg-rice noodle hybrid dish. No, there was not a dominating flavor of egg, rather the rice noodle was so yummy and soft. Would fancy another order of this in the future.
- Shrimp congee - generous helping of fat shrimp. Congee was spot on.
- HK milk tea - not the best... but goooood.
- Fried doughstick - totally necessary to compliment the congee.

Would definitely return! 4/5"}
{"text":"Came here on a sick day cuz congee is sick people food in my culture. But this time, maybe cuz i was sick, the congee was so salty. And i couldnt finish it due to that and loss of appetite. Took half of it home and after i warmed it up the next day, it was so watery. 

What i ordered:
Minced beef congee
Thousand year egg and pork congee 
Fried dough rice roll 
Iced hk milk tea 

There wasnt a line this time when i came for late dinner around 10pm. They close midnight i believe."}
{"text":"My review is only based on the rice rolls (Chang Fen) experience. 

We visited Yin Ji after 9:30PM on Sunday night. The restaurant was half full. We were seated immediately and served with warm water. Service was efficient and friendly. 

Since Yin Ji is famous for rice roll, we ordered 4 different kinds:

Shrimps with Chive, Marinated Beef with chive, Marinated chicken with chive (the Chinese wording actually is Chicken with Chinese mushroom), Sweet corn. The rice roll skin was very thin yet \"bouncy\". The meat filling was fresh. I like the soya sauce on top which was not very salty although it made every dish taste the same. 

We also ordered the Sweet Cruller; it was fresh and hot and not oily. 

We will definitely go back if we crave for rice roll."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Warden Ave and Steeles Ave E in the same building as Ajisen Ramen.The main entrance was a bit of a walk from the parking lot. Fortunately, there were lots of emptyspots in the parking lot.

[SERVICE] - 3/5
Staff were efficient and food came quickly. A lot of servers worked on that night, and everythingwent smoothly during the dinner rush. They did not have much time to check on our table, but Iunderstand they tried their best to tame the crowd.

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
Small and seated a lot of customers but was clean. This looked like a more modern/refined spotfor rice noodle rolls in comparison to the old-school/authentic ones in southern China and HongKong.

[QUALITY] - 4/5
Rice noodles were high-quality, fresh, and soft! Congee had a good amount of pork andpreserved egg! Definitely worth the value.

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Shredded Pork & Gold Preserved Egg Congee - $5.00: lots of shredded pork and preservedegg. Congee tasted quite comforting, and the green onion & cilantro added freshness to thehearty bowl of goodness.

- Egg Rice Noodle Roll - $3.75: We ordered this because egg was not a common ingredient inrice noodle rolls. The verdict: egg was soft, blended with the noodle roll, and tasted a tad tooone-dimensional. Definitely was unique, but would not order again.

- Dough Stick Rice Noodle Roll - $4.00: I would prefer if the dough stick was a little crispier.Nonetheless, I still really liked this rice noodle roll, especially dipped in the peanut & hoisinsauce!

- Marinated Chicken Slices with Chives Rice Noodle Roll - $4.50: chicken slices were deliciouslymoist and steamed to perfection.

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I would definitely recommend the rice noodle rolls and congee at Yan Ji Chang Fen becausethey are affordable, simple, and so comforting!"}
{"text":"Great Cheng fen ! The chicken and mushroom didn't have enough filling. The appetizer the rice wrap was just ok. So just get the cheng fen and you are good. Small place so you are going to have to wait."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.
Came here on Sunday and it was packed! It was lunch time and the place is small so a wait is understandable, but the only thing I didn't like was how there isn't really a waiting area and everyone is crammed inside not only blocking the entrance but also standing behind tables watching others eat.

The big thing here are the rice noodles.

Beef & Pork Rice Noodle ($4.50) and Beef & Shrimp Rice noodle ($5.50, +$1.25 to add an egg)
Both these rice noodles were their recommended dishes. Actually adding an egg with the rice noodles tastes pretty good. Hard to explain the difference but you can taste the difference to a regular rice noodle. There was a decent amount of beef and shrimp so that was nice. Different than the usual type of rice noodles you get at dim sum restaurants, it's a lot bigger and it's not exactly the thinnest rice noodles I've had but the texture of it is soft not feeling too thick; the rice noodle and ingredients ratio is just right. The sweet soya sauce is key! 

Lai Wan Style Assorted Congee ($5.00)
Good price for this big bowl of congee, not to mention there was a lot of ingredients inside including bbq pork slices, a lot of squid, and some slices of fish. The flavoring of the congee was food, but I personally thought the congee wasn't as thick as I'd expect it to be. Normally the rice would be really grinded up and mushy but this felt more liquidy.
My boyfriend tried the shredded pork and preserved egg congee ($4.50), which lacked a bit of flavor. He added a lot of pepper into his.

Dough Sticks ($2)
I actually noticed they already increase the price for this one. Looking at menu pix from February it was $1.75 but at my last visit they were already $2. Goes well with the congee, I would perfect if they were a little more crispy though. 

Overall I liked the food here, would come again because I like the rice noodles and there aren't that many Congee/rice noodle places left aside from the big franchises (congee queen, congee wong, etc.)"}
{"text":"Curry fish ball
Frozen milk tea
Pork and shrimp noodles
Pork liver, kidney, sliced pork congee

This place is a small hole in the wall. Very busy. Waited about 5 mins for a table during breakfast time. The food came out real fast.

We ordered:
- curry fish balls which had a nice curry flavor and a really good kick to it. If I ate more, I felt like I was breathing firing since I don't eat a lot of spicy foods.
- frozen milk tea which was a cup of cold milk tea placed in a bowl of shaved ice
- pork and shrimp noodle - loves the flavor. I had them hold the soy sauce since my partner in crime doesn't like soy sauce. Even without soy sauce it had a lot of flavor. The pork and shrimp tasted like it was marinated before hand.
- Pork liver, kidney, sliced pork congee - a little on the blander side for me so I out some pepper to add flavor

I would definitely come back and try the other dishes"}
{"text":"I was just driving by the intersection of Warden and Steeles when this restaurant caught my eyes. To find a restaurant that specifically serves rice noodle rolls and congee (and a couple of other items) was very intriguing. 

I ordered 3 different types of rice noodle rolls (churn fun): the BBQ pork with green onion, the beef and shrimp (one of their popular rolls) and the fried dough roll. Each roll was between 4-5 dollars which was a bit pricier than typical dim sum restaurants.

Out of the 3 rolls, I really enjoyed the beef and shrimp noodle roll and fried dough roll. The noodle roll had a lot of beef and shrimp filling which was a positive aspect of it. The negative aspect of the roll was that there wasn't enough noodle dough to completely close all the beef and shrimp. It made it very difficult to pick up and eat. If you are looking for a noodle roll dish that's less salty, I would suggest requesting for less soy sauce or have it on the side as the soy sauce is saltier than usual. The fried dough roll came with a sweet hoisin and peanut dipping sauce which was a great complement to the roll. 

Overall, the food was very tasty and filling. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy rice noodles! So many toppings to choose from, and very authentic. The rice noodles are so soft tasting and very thin. The congees are not bad too! Not watery at all, thickness is perfect. Though, it seems like you can't get full no matter how many plates of rice noodles you order. Price wise, they are reasonable. 

P.S if you can, try not to come during weekends to prevent long lineups as this restaurant is quite popular among all Asians."}
{"text":"Swung by this place for some heart warming congee and was not disappointed.  When you arrive, expect to see a lineup of people but just take a number and be patient.  The line moves pretty quickly and before you know it, you will be seated.  

We ordered the millennium egg congee with chinese bread sticks to dip.  Also ordered the  beef/shrimp rice roll, a chicken/mushroom rice roll and  curry fish balls on the side.   The congee was light and well seasoned.  It tasted phenomenonal when you dip in those golden crispy Chinese bread sticks.  The rice rolls were fantastic as well.  They were very soft and the soya sauce was not too salty.  The curry fish balls were just meh, nothing special.

Definitely will hit up this place everytime I'm in the mood for congee!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit overrated. It's a good chinese breakfast palace and yes, the noodle roll was pretty good but nothing to brag. The dough roll was not made crispy. The topping inside the noodle roll was lacking and not distributed evenly. Then I got congee with pork and egg. I mean it's really nothing special. I was hoping for a more special meal."}
{"text":"With all the hype and claim... I was quite disappointed by the entire operation.  Yes, this is a new place but they look totally lost... the checkin is non existent.  You need to flag down the staff to get a seat.  The tables are not cleaned before you sit down.  The ordering process is laughable, they sit you down, don't give you a menu and ask what you would like to order.  The menu is more like a poorly constructed history book (there are empty pages to be found, maybe we will have better menu offerings?

The food... i think Meh is an overstatement. The congee is... more like a very thin rice broth with a few mix-ins boiled together and presented as xxx congee.  No texture or taste... next. Rice noodle, yes i do agree it is very silky smooth BUT too wet!  Again, NO texture or rice flavour... and no sesame/ hoisin sauce or Roasted Sesames to sprinkle over.. and lastly the must have with Congee- deep fried dough/ fritter. First, oil is not hot enough, i did have an \"oil stick\". I could have fried a fee eggs with the amount of oil inside.   It was crunchy at first but very doughy, not thr crunchy/ airy/ chewy texturenit should be.
I will pass on this and may return a few months later to see if any improvements have been made."}
{"text":"My fav: the curry fish meatballs!!!!!! Such a classic Hong Kong street food! I like the chang fen (rice noodle roll) a lot! Especially the shrimp one, very authentic Cantonese cuisine. They have good congee as well. I think that the restaurant is very casual and décor very simple, but spacious and bright. It is opened til late (midnight), and the meals that are offered there are light in general. The price is very fair and service very good in general."}
{"text":"The food is A-OK. Nothing special in my opinion that makes it worth the hype. Nothing wrong with it either though. The food comes out quickly as expected given the limited menu. Decor and seating is also pretty standard for a congee place. All in all I wouldn't want to line up if I had to wait for more than 1 table ahead of me - it's not a memorable type of meal."}
{"text":"Ying Ji Chang Fen ???? is a franchise from Guangzhou opens since 1950s which has over 30 locations and this is their first oversea location! Welcome to GTA! http://www.gz-yinji.com/

With the nickname \"Rice Noodle King\" ????, that's would be the only thing that you should order. 

Pig Blood Jello Congee ($4.50)
Skip the congee if you are used to Hong Kong Style: Sam's or even Congee Queen's Congee. The congee is more \"Canton home style\" and lack the smooth and milky texture ?????  and was meh. They used the same congee based for all their congee. So doesn't matter which variety you order, it will still be the same.

Marinated Chicken and Mushroom Rice Roll ($4.50) and Plain Rice Roll ($2.75)
The wrapping on both were nice, smooth and silky. I would just the plain rice roll if you really want to appreciate that rice roll. The filling they use for the Chicken rice roll was so so. But I love their soy sauce which were diluted and sweetened and went really well with the rice roll.

Service is friendly and fast.

{"text":"I was disappointed with the selection here. I get that the restaurant focuses on making rice rolls but I just wished they had more to offer. I tried the pork/beef, chicken and shrimp rice rolls. They were okay; the skin was thin and the filling was decent. But when it got to my table, they were drenched in too much soy sauce. I wish they put it on the side so that I could add soy sauce to taste. The fish congee was bland and a bit thick for my liking. Although it was busy at lunchtime, I honestly don't think this place is worth trying. I could get all of these dishes at a dim sum restaurant and more."}
{"text":"Congee from this place may remind you the taste of home cooked one from your childhood . The rice noodle roll is soft and thin while retaining a nice elastic feel without being too chewy. We ordered rice noodle roll with fried breadstick within - combining the feel of the noodle roll and the crunchiness of the breadstick to perfection!!  (We let a piece sat until the end of the meal and it still remained crunchy within...how?!). We also ordered beef and pork noodle roll and the shrimp with chive one. Both were very good to say the least. Overall, a must try for all who appreciate congee and rice noodle roll."}
{"text":"The rice noodles were nice and thin and smooth/slippery.  They had a nice range of rice noodles and congee.  We got the beef and shrimp rice noodle with the egg wrapping, beef and pork rice noodle, Lai Wan Tang Jai congee, fried dough fritter,  and sticky rice wrapped in leaves. The sticky rice wrapped in leaves tastes much better than the ones you usually get at dim sum.  We also got the cold hk style milk tea and ribena with lemon. The hk style tea tasted great and because of the way they cool it it's not diluted from the ice. All this for $36.  We went at 9:30 on a Sunday and already had to wait for a table but it was still early enough to be a short wait but soon after there was a wait out the door.  It's in the T&T plaza but on the side where Ajisen ramen is."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  It was one big giant marinated beef with chives rice noodle roll.  Lots of beef slices in it with chives and ...lettuces?!  The rice noodle was soft, fresh, tasty n filling.  Shredded pork and gold preserved egg congee also had lots of ingredients in it. The congee was thick, taste good.
Cash only."}
{"text":"Love the same restaurant from my home city. Same tasty food and better atmosphere and better services. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Excellent foods here. Me and my friends are really enjoying however poor service here. There are too many customers not enough staffs makes them cost 15 min to bring up my bill."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars only because they claim to be original but they are not. The Lai Wan style congee doesn't have minced beef and pork skin and fish ball slice (basically everything should be sliced), instead there is chunks of bbq pork?! So weird. The food is good but not original. Oh yeah, they only do cash so that's a bummer!"}
{"text":"Was 5 stars became one when the waitress asked me for more tips after while i got up and talking shit to me"}
{"text":"Fresh, hot food.  Good for breakfast or a rainy day! Service is quick and efficient.  Chinese comfort food"}
{"text":"Load of garbage! Halfway through eating the congee it becomes watery. Everything is nothing but salt and had to drink a lot of water after the meal. 

Worst thing is the waitress picks up the tips (which was more than 10%) we left and handed the tray to us and said it was not enough! WTH crap service, crap attitude and totally disorganized. 

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"After many attempts to come during brunch on the weekend, I finally decided to try coming on a weeknight for dinner instead. To my surprise, we didn't have to wait for a table of six. 

Their specialties are steamed rice rolls and congee. I'm not a congee fan so I won't comment on that. 

Egg Rice Noodle ($3.75) - This was my favourite out of all the steamed rice rolls that we ordered. The texture is quite different from what you would get at a Chinese dimsum restaurant. I normally hate those ones and don't even touch them, but this is delicious and I could've ate two plates of it. I'd say give it a try even if you don't normally eat this!

Curry Fish Balls ($4.75) - I liked this because it wasn't drenched in sauce but the fish balls still had a good taste when you get to the middle. 

HK Style Frozen Milk Tea ($4.25) - I thought this was a little gimmicky but I love milk tea so I had to get it. It's regular milk tea in a plastic cup served in a bowl of crushed ice. I personally didn't like the taste of the milk tea and thought it could be better.

Fried Fish Skin - Okay, this sounds and looks gross and I wasn't even going to try it at first, but my colleague kept munching on it so I tried it and I couldn't stop. It's so addicting!

The service is not the best but standard for the type of restaurant you're coming to. Prices are very good in my opinion. Great for a quick and inexpensive meal. The downside is that it's all carbs!"}
{"text":"This place makes decent congee. However the rice rolls falls apart right when you pick it up with chopsticks ."}
{"text":"This simple yet delicious restaurant really succeeded in making their rice noodle rolls. We tried their dough stick, BBQ pork, and beef options and honestly they make their rice noodle rolls soooo soft and slippery I don't think I've had it like that in any average dim sum restaurant. The dough stick that was so incredibly crunchy on the inside was wrapped around the softest rice noodle roll.. it's the perfect match. The BBQ pork though wasn't too special but the marinated beef was pretty tender. Next time I'd like to try the sweet corn rice noodle roll. It is pretty pricey in terms of what other restaurants charge for rice noodle rolls (~$5) but I think it is worth a try. I didn't really care for their congee though. Overall, the whole place just feels like you're in an auntie's home who's feeding you yummy rice noodle rolls and treats you really well :)"}
