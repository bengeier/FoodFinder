{"text":"Now that I have officially recovered from the weekend I can tell you I ate here twice last week and both times the food was incredible. The first night I had the peppercorn New York Strip lion and it was cooked just right the portions were perfect even the potato was awesome. 

For starters both visits we had the potato skins with lobster. My second visit on Saturday night I had the penne which was also really good. However I wish there would have been more I started eating people's left overs.

The drinks are also very good. The wine selection is fair for both red and white and the cocktails are also just perfect. I highly recommend the blueberry cosmo if you ever want a solid girly but delicious martini. I may have enjoyed these a little too much along with the wine but other than that totally fabulous."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Sat night arriving a few minutes early and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away. The ambiance is great and the chatter of patrons carries through the place as people are obviously enjoying themselves. Barely sat and almost instantly asked, maybe too fast but not a complaint, about drinks. Then our server, Yaz, arrived and we were duely impressed by his demeanor and professionalism! For a date night, it was off to a great start! Cups of onion soup were nice for a starter, followed our main courses: filet rare with lobster mash - amazing! Absolutely melted in my mouth! My sexy other half had a NY Strip with blue cheese and lobster mash. Steak was nice, but she enjoyed the mash more I think. A veggie medley accompanied for a complete meal that was excellent! I have eaten here a couple times previously but don't recall it as being as good as it was!! Highly recommend this steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Dined twice during one week visit.  Great service and food was perfect.   Can't wait to go back to Calgary."}
{"text":"The hotel concierge highly recommended this place,  so we tried it out after visiting the Calgary tower. The whole eating experience was excellent. Let's get the price addressed firtst. It is a VERY reasonable place to have lunch considering the serving size, the quality, the service, and the location. The server was very friendly and treated our little one with a great sense of humor.  The onion soup was yummy. The Kobi style meatballs and pasta was really good although my little guy said it wasn't as good as \"mommy's turkey meatballs\". The house salad with yellow beets was excellent. Husband got the salmon which was very good as well.  The last but not least is the calamari.  Now,  this is a must try appetizer. No joke! The pieces were cooked to perfection. They are not like the skinny pieces we normally get at restaurants. These are like steak-looking pieces. And the portion was huge like a meal itself. I liked the pieces of hot peppers on top. Very pretty and tasty at the same time. We will definitely come back again.  Oh by the way,  whatever you do, try to visit the bathrooms downstairs.. .very luxurious. We also found out that the Saltlik in Banff has different owner from this restaurant. The name is the same,  but it is all about it."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. We have to wait only 15min for the dishes at lunch time."}
{"text":"Ate there on a business trip on 10/24.  Ambiance is fine - nothing special. Service fine - again, nothing special.  Started with the chowder and then had the NY Strip with blue cheese butter.  Chowder was ok.  My steak came out as ordered, but wasn't a particularly great cut of beef - so that was disappointing.

I would summarize by saying, the food was ok, but overall the experience was completely forgettable.  Its a run of the mill / dime-a-dozen steakhouse.  Nothing really wrong with this place, just didn't live up to the hype.  I expected to be wowed based on everything I have read and heard.  All steakhouses tend to be overpriced, as this one was - but didn't find it to be offensively pricey."}
{"text":"We managed to get a table late on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy and the atmosphere was good. 

Our waitress was very attentive, made good conversation and gave good advice on the food.

I ordered the Sirloin, medium rare, and it was well cooked although I feel the steak was under seasoned. The peppercorn sauce was ok but not as flavourful as I have had before. The steak comes with a loaded baked potato as standard an it was average. Again I felt it needed more seasoning, could have been hotter/crispier and the topping could have been melted more.

My girlfriend had the slow roasted chicken which was very good and was a large portion (half a chicken). All in all great value!

The waitress suggested the chocolate lava cake for dessert and it was delicious, a perfect end the the meal.

Overall I give Saltlik a 3.5. The service and atmosphere was good but I feel the food could be made better."}
{"text":"Great steaks.  Quick, pleasant service and good atmosphere.  Was visiting from NYC and was quite pleased"}
{"text":"My husband loves steak. So for his birthday I decided to take him to the Saltlik. I had made reservations. However when we arrived we still had to wait for our table. The restaurant was busy, but there were still empty tables here and there. It appeared as though the hostesses had to figure out what they were supposed to be doing. It was a bit frustrating!

The restaurant was pretty noisy. We could barely hear each other,  which made it difficult to have a conversation. The food was OK...nothing exceptional. It was a journey in itself to simply find the washrooms, which are located downstairs. I wouldn't bother going back. There are better places to find a great steak in town!"}
{"text":"tl;dr: excellent service, but the kitchen staff's expertise was a flop.

Two friends and I went as part of a fancy night out, and we all ordered rib-eye steak. Disappointingly, it tasted like we were given slabs of roasted cardboard. Our server was impeccable regarding the matter, and insisted that we be given something else so we didn't leave hungry, and took all of the steaks off the bill.

My chosen meal replacement (chicken vegetable noodle soup) arrived minutes after I'd ordered it, but made me violently sick within the hour.

Service: 5/5, excellent service, highly apologetic that things weren't 100% satisfactory, and made every effort to make up for it
Food: 1/5, good carrot cake, but the cuts of beef used for our rib-eye steaks were exceptionally poor. Tasteless, not well-marbled, and dry. Chicken soup incited violent sickness soon after leaving the restaurant.
Atmosphere: 4/5, original decor and sculptures, dim intimate lighting, classy bathrooms."}
{"text":"New York strip with blue cheese butter was fantastic!  Great Service!  Of course, I found Calgary to be one of the friendliest places I've ever had the opportunity to visit, so I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went to Saltlik for a birthday lunch with the husband. Getting a reservation was easy and pain free. The service was quite quick, efficient and friendly even with the rush hour blitz and that impressed me, as did the dining room decor and arrangement.

On to the food: I bypassed the lunch menu and ordered a French onion soup starter, sirloin with fries entree and toffee cake dessert. The food was okay. 

I think in my mind, Saltlik  is a victim of their \"success\". Because of their reputation and prime location on Stephens ave, I was expecting to be wowed by the food. Instead, I got normal good food that won't rank as the best I've had or the worse. Truth is I've had better onion soup at a basic food chain restaurant.

All in all, not a bad restaurant food wise; fairly expensive cost wise so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Visiting alone,  and chose to sit at the bar not to occupy tables for other customers. Order a glass of wine and  the best filet steak on the menu. While waiting for my meal i go to the washroom only to come back and find i have been re-seated at an out position in the bar where my right elbow have to fight a hugh picture during my meal. Can not be that hard to ask before moving paying customers around!! 
Food was objectively seen very nice. But lack of customer care unfortunately killed the experience. Fortunately other places in Calgary to choose from next time i am around.."}
{"text":"Tasty steaks Alberta beef is the best . Great friendly service."}
{"text":"Saltlik has a nice atmosphere at the location is great. The food is pretty good but the service we had was just OK. Their menu and  food are typical for a steakhouse, nothing real seemed to stand out to us. Probably a good spot to hit up on an expense account ... My sense is that you can find much better value on your own dime."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends there last night and after reading some recent reviews was bit hesitant about it. Thankfully we had a fantastic waitress, Nerissa, and her assistants who made sure we were well taken care of with fast service, good drinks and delicious food. The calamari appetizer shared by all was so fresh and tasty. Everyone else had steak, and said they were just right; I enjoyed the Hunter chicken which was delicious with a little kick from peppercorns,  mushrooms and asparagus.  Everyone else shared the broccoli,  which had a bit of spice in it, asparagus,  and roasted cauliflower,  which was also really good. There was no room for dessert,  so can't comment on those."}
{"text":"Quiet atmosphere steaks cooked to perfection and service was outstanding when back in Calgary again will definitely going again"}
{"text":"Went with a group of nine for a birthday celebration.Or waiter was very attentive,however the timing of everything was off and the food was in general served cold.
We chose a steak place thinking they knew how to prepare steak,wrong.
The price point is out of line,noise level is high and food quality is poor.
Will never ever return again.
Free would not be a fair deal."}
{"text":"Don't go here if your group is better than like 4 people.
Planned this birthday dinner out for 10 people. Upon arrival, took over half hour to get a drink order, another 10 minutes for the the actual drink. Ordered some appetizers, they didn't put through one persons order. Meals were good, I'll give them that. Comes time to pay the bill. They split everything up for us, 18% mandatory tip. Typical though for big group. Everyone's bill is above 100 or damn near. We pay the bills, some people leave extra. The one bill was required $30 change, server does not even come back.
Finally get someone else to go get her. She says we didn't leave any extra. Argue with her for 5 minutes, she admits she mixed the money in with another tables money. Has to get a manager.
They come back with a stack of cash trying to say this was this table, and that was that table.
Whatever. We just gave you guys $1500 with 18% gratuity on each bill. You're gonna argue over $20? 
She brings the manager, he stand there like a wet noodle and doesn't say a word.
Just give us the $20 like seriously? 
Absolutely shit way to end this dinner, thanks so much."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for a nice dinner at the saltlik, it was her first time dining there but I had been before with a friend. My wife ordered the filet which she quite enjoyed along with seasonal vegetables and a baked potato. I rose the NY striplion with season vegetables which tastes like they had been on fire as they had an odd smoke taste to them, my steak was just okay as it had a tendon in it and wasn't as tender as you would expect for $34. 

Drinks were good we each had a beer to start and the a glass of the Malbec with our steak which was very nice. 

Hostess greeted us and took my jacket for me and seated us, they were very friendly and prompt. 

Waitress seemed new but she was friend and definitely giving her all, the rest of the team seemed to cover for each other to make sure you got served and that you had everything you ordered, definitely good coverage. 

I will return but will try a different menu item, and I would still recommend to my friends to go here for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my wife for a nice dinner before going to a show. Very comfortable seating outside on Stephen Ave. Nice ambiance and professional service. The food was quite good and the prices reasonable.  Tried the scallops and the cheese pate for appetizers and both were excellent. We both tried the petite fillet and were happy with the results. Have also tried the Saltlik in Banff and found it quite good as well.
We would recommend both locations for a nice dinner out on the town."}
{"text":"For a long time, I didn't like Saltlik. The menu never enticed me and whenever I did order anything it was just blah. I decided to give this place another chance and met a friend here for lunch. 

Half expecting the same old menu, I was elated to see that they had done a turnover and a lot of the items sounded really good. I settled on the shrimp and scallop pasta and my friend got the chicken sandwich.

I was really happy with my choice; the seafood was cooked perfectly and tossed in a tomato pesto that coated the noodles nicely. 

Saltlik, you've won me over. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First off, this place isn't a steak house, and if others tell you that it is, either they don't know what a steak house is or have limited experience eating steak in restaurants.  I ordered the expensive lunch special which was a steak sandwich coming in at a $27 price point.  It was not worth the price paid for the meal, based on quantity and quality, you can get a much better steak in Calgary, trust me!  The service was very good though, and a pretty good atmosphere in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One word, amazing! We went to Saltlik for the first time last nite, what a beautiful restaurant! Definitely impressed. Our server James was great, very friendly, and down to earth, all while still being professional.

We had the popcorn shrimp, soooooo good. Lobster mashed potatoes are a definite must have.... I'm drooling just thinking about them. Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly, great portions. Dessert was a chocolate ganache cake, save room!

It is kind of pricey, I guess some people would think that? But well worth it. Not to mention they played some awesome music, a mix of everything from Guns'n'Roses to The Killers.

It was a perfect way to spend our anniversary, and I would recommend going there to anyone!"}
{"text":"Calgary is known for its grade A beef!  I decided to try it since it was close to my hotel.  I found the restaurant crowed and difficult to move around.  Just getting out of my chair proved to be a challenge without banging the chair behind me.

I ordered my blue steak for dinner but I'd better at the other steakhouses such as Kxx.  Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with my steak, just that I was expecting a more since I was in cattle country!  To date, the best I've eaten are in the USA.

Décor was awesome and the waiters were very attentive!"}
{"text":"We will be back! Read some reviews that almost made us not try this place. Our Waiter Tyler was awesome as well as the other staff that checked in frequently to see if we needed anything..great steaks and lobster mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"Wow! We had my son's wedding reception there June 24 and the staff was accommodating, polite, much appreciated. But the food! Fantastic! They had several appies and each one was better than the one before it.  Food choices were perfect for the 25 to 90 year old crowd. New fan here."}
{"text":"A great restaurant! Stylishly designed, this place ended up being a fun night. Excellent service with knowledgable staff. We ordered the Halibut and a sirloin steak. The fish was tender and the steak... the steak was amazing! A wonderful place for dinner."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here to celebrate my sister's birthday.  We wanted something a little higher end yet not too exorbitantly priced.  A few of the guys had been to Ruth Chris' a week prior, and they were slightly sceptical of my mom's choice to go to Saltlik.

Perhaps we got lucky, but everyone's steaks were tender, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  I ordered a petite fillet and it was a perfectly sized steak.  If you don't want it small, order the grande.  My one \"beef\" with the beef here is that they don't list the size of the steak in oz like they do at many other steakhouses.  

The guys in our group declared that their grande rib eyes were much better than at Ruth Chris'.  Score one point for Saltlik!  We all particularly enjoyed one of the options on the menu which was what they called the \"Chicago\" style.  I'm not sure what Chicago has to do with it... but ordering it this way gave you a steak that was slightly more charred on the outside and cooked-to-order on the inside.  Awesome.

The service was ok.  Not great...  In fact, if our conversation wasn't so engaging, I would likely have been irritated.  I'm hoping that the reason they didn't stop by much was so as not to interrupt."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular haunts for supper before a show at the CPO or one of our fine theatres downtown.  The food is always great (and reasonably priced -- especially their steaks), the staff is friendly and quick to serve (and very good at wine recommendations when you can't make up your mind), and the venue itself is swanky and comfortable.  

Can't decide where to go for supper?  You won't go wrong with this place.

Also: if you work downtown, and want to go to a nice lunch on a Friday, bring yourself and your casual Friday blue jeans here for a burger and relax for a bit."}
{"text":"Arrived without reservation on a beautiful if slightly cool early June night. Patios full.... Calgarians are s hearty bunch.

No table available but the hostess found me a seat at the bar. She updated staid a couple of times so that I knew she hadn't forgotten me... and as a walk-in single I had low expectations given that the place was full.

Two glasses of chianti at the bar and then transported to a booth... more than I needed to eat but perfect to review stuff for tomorrow's conference.

Service was friendly and effective, My server was professional and efficient and the steak and salad showed up in jig's time. 

The new york striploin was perfectly done. Turned down the baked potato because I would have eaten it and the substituted house salad was perfect.

Great experience on a business trip. Great customer experience."}
{"text":"I went there the last time I was in Calgary, and it was a good experience. I'm a big fan of steak house, and I prefer to try local restaurants, before the big chains.

The food was good, but not exceptional. The service also was great, but at the end, it was a bit pricey for the quality we got. Good ambiance, and well situated near convention centers, and hotels, so it's a venue you want to try."}
{"text":"Honestly for the price it's nothing special. Service is alright, but a little overbearing. My wife and I went here for a date night and were asked about our meal no less than 5 times. 

As for the steak- again it was okay. Frankly at 40 bucks I expect a little more though, and have probably had better steaks at the keg."}
{"text":"Steaks are good but not the best in terms of proper aging to build flavors.  It is a bit business traveler ambiance due to many hotels surrounding it."}
{"text":"Whenever in Calgary, we always spend one night at the Saltlik.  They never disappoint; the food is always good- I'm just looking for some new additions to their menu, as it seems like it has been the same for years.  I had the salmon with grilled broccoli and it was fabulous.  The others in my party had filets and ribeyes...great size on those ribeyes too!     Service felt slightly rushed, even though the restaurant wasn't full.  I will always likely come back...just hoping it feels like a newer experience next time."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned reading some of the reviews as I have been to this restaurant before and it was excellent.  We went on a Stampede Saturday night and was not disappointed.  The service and food was excellent, especially the lobster mash with a filet.  I will be back again when I come to town."}
{"text":"Been here for both business lunch and dinner.  Very nice staff and service.  Steak and grilled vegetables were done to perfection both times.  Would recommend for sure.  One note is that it can get loud during the rush so I could see it  not the best place for romance.  Still a very good overall experience."}
{"text":"Visiting from California. Very loud, hard to hear our tables conversation. Casual but think that was just because of the Stampede.  Food & service very good. Only giving three stars because of loudness."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre food coupled with average service at best delivered a dining experience I wish I could take back. My ribeye arrived undercooked and felt like it was made over an hour prior to serving. The entire experience was very underwhelming, and I should be more upset, but my company was good. This place needs a lot of fixing before it can be deemed a reputable steakhouse."}
{"text":"We arrived and were promptly seated even though it was very busy for a Thursday night. We were a group of 8 and had a great server who was very friendly and personable. He let us know the specials and took our drink order. He took great care of us all night.

We all ordered different items but the majority of us did have steak as our main entrée.

Steak was phenomenal - cooked perfectly at medium rare with grilled veggies on the side. Dessert of molten lava cake was delicious. Rich and warm. A definite must have.

Food, service and experience were all top notch. Will be back."}
{"text":"A group of 6 popped in here after a long day at the office. And by that I mean a long day at the convention centre. I was in Calgary for work. It was GREAT to find a place downtown that was still serving, as we didn't arrive until after 9pm, and having been to Calgary many times on business, i've been turned away from restaurants more times than I can count. (Downtown kitchens don't seem to stay open late on week nights.)

I wasn't starving, as I had a pre-dinner dinner (a must when you work until 9-10pm) but I wanted to take advantage of the \"Alberta Beef\" thing. When in... do as, you know.

I ordered the petit prime sirlon, and my steak rare (obvs.) It was well cooked (or rather, appropriately cooked), but REALLY chewy. Like the last person to finish her meal, my jaw hurts chewy. There was a lot of gristle, which was too bad, but the flavour was good. The baked potato was fine, but I must admit my plate looked very empty with a small steak and a baked potato on it. Some garnish, or a few veggies would have gone a long way.

I split the caramel toffee pudding, and it was fantastic. Very sweet. EXCEPTIONALLY sweet in fact, and served with ice cream, but I'm not a lady that is afraid of sweet things! In fact you might even say that I covet. So this was not a problem. :)

Dinner with tax and tip (no drinks) came to $35. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"We went after this restaurant suggested by a friend. We were impressed with our server, he was polite and friendly and made us feel welcome. Beer and Wine selection is also very good. The restaurant itself is also very nice with great lighting and an inviting atmosphere.

The house burger was delicious, and would highly recommend. It came with plenty of fries! As for the steak... for the price I was honestly expecting a little more. The NY Strip I had was delicious, and cooked to perfection at medium-rare. However, I wouldn't rank it as the best steak/$ I've had from a steakhouse. the The side baked potato was good and fully loaded.

Be sure to ask about the chefs cut, as we weren't informed until I asked."}
{"text":"Slow service, poor cut of beef and everything tasted off.  

The asparagus was thin and overcooked. I spent $108 CAD (one person, no alcohol, no dessert) and it was certainly not worth it. 

The view from the patio is outstanding.  

To be more specific about what was wrong with the state, in my opinion a ribeye should at least be 1 inch thick. Anything thinner than 1 inch is too much like something you would get at Denny's."}
{"text":"Maybe nothing and nobody can ever meet my expectations anymore. I wanted so much more with my presentation. It was JUST ok. I have had better steaks from costco made on my bbq. 

I am not giving a bad review, I was just hoping for better. 
boo."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food for the price. The decorations and ambiance are nice. We had to wait so long for the food to come. My girlfriend and I had the same steak, mine was okay and hers was so dry. I don't cook much, but I can make better steak than that. 

No one came around during we ate until we finished the meal. I told one of the female server that the steak was dry that my girlfriend couldn't finish it. She only said that the meal was big for her and just ignored what I said about the steak.
I even asked her for the bill and waited 10 minutes, but she didn't come back with the bill then I had to asked another server for it."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Filet mignon, grilled salmon, lobster mash and chocolate soufflé were very good. However, service was slow as we kept looking for our server when our drinks were empty, table maintenance could also have been much better. We had a large group of ppl so I'm assuming it was tough for them to have all of our meals to be to temp. We were not auto gratted for our large party which was nice, unless they forgot."}
{"text":"On one of my monthly lunches out with some co-workers, we ventured over to Saltlik. Although it's a steakhouse, none of us had any steak. We all had the chicken and arugula salad. It was fantastic. Nice large portion with grilled chicken, fresh buffalo mozzarella and this lemon olive oil dressing. I love artichokes which aren't a common item on most menus. My friends and I agreed this salad surpassed our expectations. My salad was paired with a glass of German Riesling which had a teeny bit of bubble in it. Very very nice. The girls shared this decadent warm dark molten cake fresh out of the oven, made just for us. OMG! It was to die for! It came with some berries and ice cream but when you have that incredible chocolate cake, who needs that stuff to take away from the main event? I sure don't! I may have to go back for just the cake and a glass or two of wine. Now that's lunch!"}
{"text":"Waited at our table for over 20 minutes, no wait staff came by at all.  No drink orders, no water, nothing. 


Walked out and went to Ruth's Chris instead."}
{"text":"Had to eat steak in Stampede country.

And it was a pretty good steak.  Not a spiritual connection to the bovine god, but pretty good.  The sides were solid, the meat was cooked properly and to the exact specification listed on the menu (yes, that's medium rare), and the wine list was solid.  A fried calamari appetizer was proper and tasty, as were the salads.

Have to comment on the service, though. Yeah, I know Calgary's a petro-boomtown with a lot of young, educated, and upwardly mobile people, and also that it's the only game in town for Albertans looking to play in the big leagues, but damn... I thought SF during the pre-bomb-dot-com was excessive. It seems like any place without a takeout counter or pictures on the menu has to hire an army of scantily-clad women to dispense the food and drink. It's particularly funny when you stagger in the front door, with numb extremities and concerns about frostbite, and the door is held for you by a pleasant young women wearing a dress smaller than your scarf.

But I'm a weak and worthless Californicator who's used to a +/- 10C difference between summer and winter."}
{"text":"a solid 4star evening dinner. friendly service, good quality food and even the price tag is nice. Filet Mignon with spicy broccoli as side dish.

go an find out. they have even a patio seeting available!"}
{"text":"Went to Saltlik last week for the first time after hearing some local contacts say it was good and I wasn't disappointed.  I had the filet mignon, lobster mashed potatoes, and salad (one with feta cheese, etc).  The food was great - cooked well, nice presentation, and overall delicious.  I could make a meal just out of the lobster mashed potatoes!

Had an awesome server named Erin J that I would highly recommend for anyone coming in.  She made the visit very pleasant, was very courteous, and helpful for my visit to Calgary."}
{"text":"The salmon was overcooked to death but the cheesecake was damn good so it evens out. I won't bother going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Natick, MA and just had a wonderful late dinner at Saltlik. I had the petite filet mug on and side house salad and have to say it was the best meal and best steak I've had in ages. Wonderfully cooked, interesting and tasty ingredients in house salad, and very friendly and prompt service from Sanjali who went above and beyond to ensure we had a super visit.  We had been planning to have dinner at Sky 360 when we're back in town next Friday but will be returning to Saltlik instead! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Great filet. They were out if hollandaise but the bernaise made up for it the service was excellent. Very attentive. I would recommend Ali to anybody. A foodie at heart and way more informational on the nightlife than the 'concierge' at the hotel."}
{"text":"We decided to grab a seat at the bar and watch the hockey game on a Sat night.
A few people were in the small lounge, no one was at the bar. Unless you count all the staff.
Beer was good, drinks were good, service at the bar was decent. Prices for drinks average.
This place had weird management. The staff all come out to the bar to eat, next to us, their patrons. They were loud, bordering on obnoxious and treated the bar staff like crap while some enjoyed drinking free bottles of wine. The manager was enjoying her bar seat as well until she had to go and deal with customer complaints. (not ours)
We did not try any of the food and I am not sure I would return here.
Not my idea of how a nice restaurant should run. I am not sure if the owner is just lax or what but I think he/she would do better business to tighten up ship a bit regarding staff policies."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Saltlik is definitely the place to go for a casual business lunch, but beware it gets packed quickly! The downtown location is spacious (with two floors) and has a very 'earthy' / warm feel it. It also has this gorgeous chandelier of different coloured blown glass as a focal point in its main dining area. 

Our server was friendly, but seemed frazzled right when lunch service started. However, she always made sure we were doing well and didn't leave us high and dry especially during the lunch rush. The food came out in a very reasonable time, could probably finish lunch in an hour.

I would say Saltlik is a more refined version of Moxies. Don't expect anything too fancy or complex on their menu. Their lunch menu consists of light appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, fish (halibut and salmon), and a small selection of steaks (sirloin or NY strip loin) - there is a more extensive steak list for dinner. The prices are reasonable for a sit down business lunch (around $20-$30/meal) depending on what you get.

My friend and I ordered the 'Calamari' ($14) appetizer to share which was an excellent start to our meal. There were large pieces of tender lightly battered squid, complimented by a squirt of grilled lemon and a mixture of bell peppers, onions, poblanos, and serranos. I rarely enjoy calamari because I could never taste the squid but this was such a fresh and light dish! 

I was torn between getting a sandwich or burger, but decided to try their 'Mushroom & Gruyere Burger' ($15) after remembering my friend telling me they were excellent. The burger was simply made with a slice of cheese, mound of mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and red onions. I found the burger very bland, one dimensional, and the patty had a bitter burnt taste on the edges. On the bright side I had a very good side of salad which had goat cheese, almond slivers, and strawberries. It didn't even need the extra dressing! 

My friend got their CAB Prime Sirloin ($24) with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side. I was expecting a bigger piece of meat but it was about 4oz-6oz with a spiced crust.

If you don't want to break the bank for lunch, while still have a decent meal I suggest visiting Saltlik if you already haven't. Just don't expect anything too extra-ordinary."}
{"text":"Great place downtown Calgary. Deffinately a great cow place if you like steak. Our server Megan was very attentive and great. Dessert was awesome too. Love the cheese cake."}
{"text":"I met a client here for dinner tonight and had a good experience.  The service was professional and friendly, the atmosphere was very nice and the food was good.  My only complaint is that our entrees came out just minutes after our soup and salad course - I would have expected better from a place of this quality.

However, the french onion soup was spot on and the salmon with broccoli was quite tasty too.  I hear the steaks are amazing, but I just wasn't looking for something so heavy."}
{"text":"Saltlik is only alright.  Nothing more, nothing less.  

Some Calgarians talk about Saltlik like it's the second coming; don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Saltlik in Banff several time and my experiences there have been exceptional. Great service, great atmosphere, amazing drinks.

It's only natural that a restaurant to change and evolve every few years or so. The first time I visited was over a decade ago and it was a chic bar that served great cocktails that got me drunk instantly. There I saw some YTV actor obnoxiously hitting on some guy's poor girlfriend. Was it her fault that she happened to wear a low cut cleavage that even Saltlik's most creative martini couldn't overshadow? Who knows

The second time the place turned into a steakhouse. But rather than your generic Keg/Joey T experience, we weren't' distracted by scantily clad servers. Instead we got very professionally dressed and very professional servers who spoke to you with their hands rested behind their backs. The food was amazing and it had to be, given the price we paid for aged steaks.

But the third time, and I don't know if the Calgary location has always been this way, was another experience. It was great but I can't help but miss the old Saltlik experiences I've had.

I was disappointed to find out about their lackadaisical drink menu, just plain beers and regular cocktails. I settled for a pint draft. However, their appetizers however were enough to turn this would-be 3star review to a 4 star. 

We shared their beef carpaccio, mac n cheese, and calamari. The carpaccio was fresh and succulent. I'm always weary about eating raw beef but it came through perfectly as the arugula salad and capers complimented the tender strands of beef. The calamari was good, certainly better than the pre-frozen rubber pucks served at pubs. And the mac n' cheese was cheesy and had a well executed crust.

Our service was just as great as expected. Mind you, one of my dining companions happened to work there part time so we were pretty tight with our server. No rough spots when you have industry insiders in your crew.

The decor is amazing, there's a massive hanging glass piece in the middle of the dining room that looks something out of zero-gravity science fiction. Apparently it costs half a million dollars, or maybe a million. I looked at it and imagined cutting off the cable that held it up and taking out a whole slew of bad guys at the bottom, possibly dining and celebrating over something. My daydreams have plot holes and I'm okay with that."}
{"text":"I walked around the area trying to find a steakhouse to satisfy my craving for some  delicious steak. I came in here hoping for the best and I feel I've been provided with the best.
My waitress for the night is Maddie, and she is just amazing. She was prompt, sharing her own thoughts with the food. Since it's my first time in the restaurant, she suggested the Lobster Mash to pair with my steak. And OMG, that Lobster Mashed Potato is delicious. It's mashed potato with large pieces of lobster on top. It is worth every cent.
Now to the main course, steak! I ordered the Filet Mignon, my friends ordered ribeye, and sirloin. All three steak came cooked perfectly right on dot for both rare and medium rare. I find the ribeye is the best valued. For $39 you get a 15 oz of steak and yes, cooked to perfection. I don't know what I can say to praise this place. Everything is just wonderful.
Oh! One thing... They don't allow us to bring our own wine. Hmm... I guess that's the only downside?"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for their happy hour. Servers are well versed with their menus. Coming from coastal area I always love to have some raw fish to mix with some of my dish. So I had Ahi Tuna tartare, Wok fired calamari, dry ribs paired with my favorite Prosecco."}
{"text":"We went there for our new years eve dinner. Very nice atmosphere and nice decoration inside the restaurant.The who served us was really friendly and suggested food from their menu. Food was okay!! As it is a steakhouse I was hoping for A class steak. I had their fillet mignon which tasted aright.  Their sticky toffee pudding is really good and nicely presented. Good for group dinner and date night."}
{"text":"I've been to Saltlik a number of times for lunch and dinner.  I really like their location and atmosphere.  The service has always been reasonably good.  But I really wish they that would revamp their menu, particularly their lunch menu.  Personally, I would love to see a big steak salad as part of their line-up.  It's a personal preference, but I don't like to eat a heavy lunch but sometimes do like a bite of steak.  I would gobble up a big steak cobb salad with loads of fresh veggies and blue cheese!"}
{"text":"Good quality meat is expertly cooked at this upscale establishment.  Think of this as a once a year kind of place.  Pretty pricy, but you get what you pay for.  Excellent martini selection and the service is pretty standard.  Good ambiance.  Overall, a great jumping point for a memorable night out!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had the steak and on top of that have not had to pay for any meal here yet... Why? because it's a frequent business presentation lunch venue favoured by a few of the vendors I deal with. I've been here 3-4 times and each time the steak has been perfectly cooked and when you consider they are sending out anywhere from 25-40 meals at a time that's pretty amazing. I would pay for the steak myself if I had to but so far I've been blessed with a few really good lunches there."}
{"text":"I am an American staying at a nearby hotel, in Canada on business.  Many of my colleagues who had been visiting for sometime prior to me had recommended this place.  They do, indeed, have great steak.  We have tried steaks at many restaurants throughout the city, and they have the best so far.  They declare their Chipotle steak to have a \"kick-ass\" sauce.  As with many spicy dishes I've had in Calgary, it was disappointing but only in lacking a true spicy heat.  The flavor is great.  The skinny fries aren't necessarily better tasting than regular fries but they are fascinating!  Unlike the states, when one orders a steak well-done, it comes out well-done...no pink & juicy!!!

It is said that you MUST try the Chocolate Cake.  It is baked fresh at the time it is ordered because it is filled with liquid chocolate that runs freely into the berry compote when you first dip your fork into it.  The vanilla bean ice cream is the perfect compliment.  It is truly grand.  The New York style cheesecake is my personal favorite.

The atmosphere is pleasant.  As Americans, we are quite used to the service being quicker.  It takes some getting used to in dining out taking 2 hours.  This isn't so much a complaint as an observation because it seems to be the Canadian, norm no matter the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not a huge steak connoisseur. For some reason, it is just hard for me to be impressed with a grilled slab of meat. However, there were a few times in my life when I was really wowed by the flavour and texture of steak, and it is those fond memories that drive me to visit a steakhouse once in a blue moon. Plus, being in Calgary, I decided it was finally time to try that famed Alberta beef. 

Saltlik seemed like a natural choice - smack in the middle of downtown, with a cool name and a fancy-looking huge glass door that separates the chosen few on the inside from the plebes wandering the 8th Avenue. And I am only half kidding - as I understand, a steak restaurant is a special occasion kind of a place, where you splurge but expect elite food and elite service.

Saltlik, on the other hand, is very down to earth. Too much so, actually. The tiny lobby was being cleaned as I walked in, as if the restaurant was closing. The staff, while very friendly, is not really best educated on the wine and food choices. 

The first surprise came when I found out there was no bread (!) in the restaurant - only garlic bread, which, naturally, is not free. That was a first one for me. The house salad is less than impressive - bitter salads, a couple of cut strawberries and a tiny bit of goat cheese. No tomatoes or other vegetables. But OK, that was just a snack before the big steak dinner. 

I waited, and waited, and then more. Finally, the meat came. What can I say? It was another night of disappointment in my quest for a perfect steak. It was dry-ish and rather tough, despite my lengthy requests for something tender and marbled when ordering. 

So, that's about it for Saltlik. I am afraid it's another case of a restaurant trying to be something it isn't, which is all too common in Calgary, alas."}
{"text":"This is my first review...ever, so please bare with me

As soon as I walked in, my expectations were high. It had a cozy atmosphere with an inviting decor of dark wood walls. The staff was very pleasant and seated us right away. Wine list was good.  I got the Petit Filet (medium rare) which for me was cooked to perfection. Would definitely recommend it. Next time I am in Calgary, it will be my first dinner out."}
{"text":"Right away we noticed that the service here was a little slow and it took quite a while for them to actually take out orders. 

With that being said the steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were generous sized portions as well. Our server was pretty nice and I highly recommend the duck fat fires and their steaks"}
{"text":"Executive Summary:  Pretty good food and comfortable surroundings.  Service, however, is not to the standards one would expect from a place serving top-rate Alberta beef.

Spent the week up here with my honey planning our Banff wedding and decided to try an upscale place because we like good steaks.  Several people recommended Saltlik so we gave it a shot. The place is comfortable, interesting, and not pretentious.  

The steaks were good.  I wasn't sure what to expect about Alberta beef but I had a Filet that, while not trimmed (which was weird), was still tender and tasty.  My better half had the prime sirloin which was super lean and had great flavor.  The veggies were fresh and nicely prepared.

The service, however, lacked polish.  The staff was friendly and seemed eager but they either didn't have enough staff or Canadian timeliness is different because they're being courteous and don't want to remotely rush anyone. We waited almost ten minutes to order our drinks and wine.  No mention of specials or whether we'd been there before or anything. Normally in places like this they try to assess your level of hillbilly-ness but not so here.

Little touches that I expect were lacking here.  They didn't bring clean silverware to the table after our appetizers were cleared.  No familiarity with the BC wine I ordered.  No suggestions as to menu items.  Again, the staff was friendly enough but service in a steakhouse really should be something other than \"meh--it was ok.\""}
{"text":"3.5 STARS. Food is good to very good (not exceptional). Three members of out party had streak - all 3 steaks were a combo of unfortunately chewy and then very delicious. I had the linguini and enjoyed every bite. The service is good to very good (not exceptional). Younger, trim hostesses dressed in black - some lacked experience that one would expect of a higher-end restaurant.  The ambiance is very good to excellent; a great place and space to relax - get one of the tables by the fireplace if you can (arrive earlier than later to get one). There is no coffee to be had after dinner - none. This is a med-range steak place. Ruth Chris might be a better bet.
Cheers."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.My wife and I both ordered  strip loin steaks and they were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating even though members of our party were running late.Was a little loud in the restaurant though."}
{"text":"Service SUCKED!

I went to Saltlik this past Saturday with a party of 9, guaranteeing our server her 18%. With that guarantee, why even try? Our waitress most certainly did not.

I prepared detailed notes this past weekend of the service failures (I waited tables for 15 years) but the rant got too long to post here...

My suggestion, do not go to this restaurant with a party of 8 or greater. The amateurs running the show cannot guarantee you an experience worthy of 18 points atop their already reasonably steep prices.

What a remarkable disappointment this place turned out to be... Food was OK with only a few complaints, all of which is overshadowed by an entitled millennial, looking great in her little black dress and heels, with ZERO fine dining serving skills earning her guaranteed income. Working at Saltlik and getting large tables must feel akin to winning a lottery.

I will never go there again."}
{"text":"We went here before theatre.  I had onion soup, BBQ ribs, and apple pie.  Came home and was violently ill. Still sick 3 days later.  Everyone else was fine so I'd avoid the ribs in the future."}
{"text":"It does have a good ambiance and the decor looks great, but for a restaurant that puts itself as a rare steakhouse it was a joke. The ribeye I had was as good as any other one from Montana's or Milestone... absolutely nothing like others high end steakhouses I have been. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Went Fri Nov 19th, had a 7:45pm reservation.  Not an issue, walked right in.  Restaurant about 75% full.

Very helpful waitress.  Ordered calamari as appetizer.  Decent.

I had rib eye as my main course.  A little fatty, but cooked perfectly (ordered it medium)  Had a loaded baked potato as my side, was good.

GF had the ribs, decent portion, lots of sauce.  Fall off the bone meat, so she was happy.

Overall, this restaruant is more of an upscale milestones, or earls.  

For a better steak, go to Ruths Chris."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a couple of times and decided to head in after my pedi down the street. I stopped in and perused the menu and decided to eat at the bar and scored one of the last seats. I ordered Kobe Style Meatballs with truffle cream linguini. I took issue with Kobe style instead of straight out calling it Kobe, but bartender assured it was Kobe. I ordered a slightly dirty martini with olives and it came out with a twist. Granted it was made and brought to by a different bartender, and was quickly rectified by my horrified look at the twist (I kid, I just asked where the olives were). The meatballs were good, though not spectacular. The noodles were fettuccine not linguini, and congealed into a solid mass. Dude next to me ordered the rib eye and he was pleased with his meal. I will say one thing that grossed me out. The wall, next to my dining companion dude, was covered in small black specks that I thought were bugs. He touched a couple and it fell off, so it wasn't bugs. Disturbingly, when I mentioned the wall to the bartender when checking out she seemed nonchalant and uncaring. Gross. Won't come again."}
{"text":"Hello Mr. Server.  You were awesome.  Great service from this gent.  I made my nerd comments.  I 'eeeehhhhhhh'ed  when he said Canadian lamb was on special.  I had ribs and the woman I was with had a steak.  Our starter was the mac and cheese.  Holy crap, it was freaking delicious.  I almost got arrested because it made me feel too sexy.  Yum yum.  I still need to repeat something to the folks there.....Risotto.  Everybody and their dog loves it.  Put it on you menu.  I love classy places, but risotto is classy.  Wink wink ;)"}
{"text":"wow this place is amazing! come here during stampede week and it's 6 stars because the waitresses are all wearing daisy dukes and cowboy boots! We all know Calgary girls are sexy, especially with shorts on and long legs. ;)

oh wait, this is a food place. 

This place is not expensive at all for an upscale steakhouse and the quality of their steak is phenomenal. Definitely worth visiting a few times. 

Order the fillet mignon."}
{"text":"Saltlik is one of Calgary's many popular steakhouses, and since they're located right in the heart of cow town they know have to do steak right. The ambience is what you would expect if you picture a traditional steakhouse, dark wood, leather chairs, and white table cloths.

The service is usually pretty good, the servers are attentive and professional, they also have a great wine list that is worth a look. They also have some great salads and soup options if you're visiting for lunch and don't want to commit to the early afternoon food coma from a heavy meal. The sticky toffee pudding is one of my favourites, it'll satisfy you sweet tooth for a week at least! 

I've visited for several birthday dinners, work lunches and during the big taste and the quality and service has been consistent each time."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I've been to Saltlik a number of times. Unfortunately this last visit was a real bummer. If we return I hope to update this review with a far superior rating.

We had family in town and wanted a nice steak, so naturally Saltlik came to mind. The 4 of us all ordered the special of the night, the Filet Mignon medium rare. I had the lobster mashed potatoes, my hubby had the garlic mashed potatoes, my MIL had the salad & her spouse had the lobster mashed potatoes as well. 

As we waited we ordered the Calamari and Duo Dip starters. Personally I was disappointed that the Beef Carpaccio wasn't on the menu anymore, it's a personal favorite. The environment was loud and chaotic. It's not the restaurants fault that a select group of patrons had no respect for the other dinners, so moving on. 

Finally! Dinner arrives and everything looks lovely. We dig in and the first comment comes from my MIL's partner comments that the Bearnaise sauce is cold, we all agree. This seems odd to us and the (not room temperature but darn right cold) sauce is cooling down the steaks. Then we try the potatoes and all 3 of us have cool potatoes. Talk about disappointing, but we continue to eat.

The steaks seemed fine initially but when I got just shy of the first bite from the side of mine it was rare, not medium rare as I had requested. I politely asked for mine to be sent steak back and cooked a bit more. I kept my potatoes because by this point I was starving! The potatoes were not my favorite (personally I'd prefer smaller lobster pieces) but I worked around them. After i sent my steak back my husband decided his was too rare too and sent his back as well. The server offered to take his potatoes back, which interestingly she had not done with me. I also asked the server to have the Bearnaise warmed, to which she returned to the table to inform me that the chef said 'it was suppose to be that way, and would taste disgusting if it wasn't at room temp.\" I insisted and oddly enough it tasted far better slightly warmed. *ahem* Might I remind you it wasn't even room temp when it was served, it was down right cold.  From there on out things were 'fine'. At the end when we asked for the bill another gentleman approached the table and offered us desert on the house because he understood there had been issues with the meals. Needless to say it was nearly closing time and my in-laws had early business meetings the next day and we politely declined. He insisted so we agreed to 2 desserts to go. Certainly a nice gesture but for the price of their steak meals I expect better quality that what we experienced.

Will we return? Perhaps. For the $$ I know of a few other places that have yet to let us down."}
{"text":"Consistent restaurant for good food and good service. Nice wine selection. A great place to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, drinks are good, but our waiter was not as funny as he thought he was. First of all, when he came to take our order, he says to one of us \"Let me guess, you want a salad, with NO dressing...I can tell by looking at you\". Pretty rude. When he returned and saw that she had polished off her entire plate of pasta, he started to clap and tell others around that she had finished her meal. Not so funny. Then he asked what we were all doing there...one of us stating that we were in the area for teachers convention. He then started to ask us if we would be offended if he ended up working in education and changed all the things we were doing as educators because it's not \"so great\". Ugh."}
{"text":"Just because I missed the one in Vancouver, that didn't last as long as it should've.  

Located right in the heart of the CBD, in terms of decor and ambience, it's a notch classier than an Earl's though a slight edge to the latter in terms of food.

Still a place to be seen.

Also great for private events, their downstairs venue even has a pool table, hi-def tv and sofa seating too."}
{"text":"7 of our group here tonite for dinner. Exceptional server assist and care. We all had steaks of some sort, appetizers, very good Ital red wine, and coffee. I had a large filet, rare. Meat was quite good, though grass fed, so not at tender as grain fed beef. Was a bit noisy to my tastes, but is a busy and popular spot. Parking is not easy, so I was in a parking garage several blocks away. Prob would not return."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be, well at least just the calamari. Went here with a couple girlfriends for a Monday night dinner. Sat down quickly as fit wasn't too busy but busier than I expected for a Monday night. 

We started with the calamari. I used to rave about the calamari but that was when they used to grill a whole calamari and served with a grilled lemon and perhaps a sauce? Can't recall but back then this was so awesome. When we ordered the calamari recently it was just a typical deep fried lightly coated calamari pieces that was in definite need of a dipping sauce. It was pretty standard and definitely not the same as it used to be. Boo, cuz that was one of the reasons I loved going here.

Anyway, my main course was the ahi tuna salad. Could definitely have used a bit more ahi tuna be less dressing. Although a very tasty dish, I just felt like it could have had a few changes to make it THAT much better. 

Topped off our evening with the lava cake, which takes 10 mins to prepare which makes me feel like its actually fresh. Great ending to our meal!

Service here was great and the atmosphere was excellent. Lots of ladies to greet you at the door and our server seemed very knowledgable and kept on top of our drinks."}
{"text":".. Its ok. 

That's about it. Pretty pricey and for a steak house, the steaks were pretty tough.. Not over cooked massive, my medium steak was perhaps medium well, but no way should have been as tough if you believe their own Steak write up. Not sure its worth the price tag, probably better off at Ruth's Chris down the street

.. Adding an extra point. When you're spending $80 on  a meal, please serve filtered water and not the crap from the tap that smells and tastes like a public swimming pool laced with chemicals, that just trashed my meal and re-rating to 2"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for an early dinner (5:30) in August.  It was pretty empty when we arrived so we were seated immediately. The staff were very curteous and prompt without being overly attentive. 

We started with the meat and cheese board appetizer which was very good. I had the CAB sirloin (rare) and wife had the filet mignon (medium rare). Both were cooked to the proper temperature, were very tender, nice char, and tasty. I actually preferred the filet to the sirloin. 

The cocktails were delicious and strong. They also had a decent wine list (not extremely long like other places) and we were able to get one of our favourite bottles.

The atmosphere was relaxed and the music was a mix of late 80's to mid 2000's alternative and indie, which we like. 

The total with tip was just about $200, which I consider reasonable for the amount and quality of food and drinks we had.

A family came in with their 10? year old son in shorts and a tank top who couldn't sit still and was bouncing around the booth and playing handheld video game. That was a bit annoying for a more expensive restaurant. The kid was more suited for McDonald's. It would be nice if the restaurant had a minimal dress code (at least sleaves on a shirt). Not a big deal, just took away from the atmosphere.


I will go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had our usual shopping workout at Winners and wanting to refill the calories we burned shopping by eating!  So, we decided on The Saltlik Steakhouse just a block down the street.  

The friendly hostess and waitress were a blur as I was distracted by my interior questioning.  Why choose the name \"Saltlik\", I know what it is but it isn't exactly the most appetizing of names, are we then the cattle grazing here?  

Isn't this a steakhouse? So why the giant cascading chilli peppers hanging from the ceiling? Is that Roman pillars framing the moulding of the fireplace? And hark do I not hear jazz in the foreground?  I decided to just try to relax and enjoy my meal.

Well, we both ordered grade A chopped steak burgers and they were incredibly yummy but they came recommended with skinny fries.  Now these fries were so skinny, I felt like eating them out of a chip bag and watching intramural volleyball.  Very grade 8 and very hickory stick.  They are tasty, that is if you are successful enough to get one on your fork. 
 
Prices were reasonable and the service pleasant, but in the end I am quite indifferent to this place.  The meal was okay and the decor still strangely perplexing but I cannot say I would rush back to this restaurant again considering all the other options there are now in Calgary."}
{"text":"Prime downtown location on Stephen Street makes this a natural choice for a nice dinner out. Interior of the restaurant is warm and inviting with fireplaces and an open kitchen.

Had the petite sirloin and loaded baked potato -- steak was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and potato was tasty and packed with sour cream, cheese and bacon bits. Portion was sizable, but not gigantic. 

Wine list was solid, but expensive. Would have been nice to have a few more reasonable options to choose from.

Service was attentive and friendly, although the overly short and tight dresses on each waitress was slightly off-putting -- made it seem like the restaurant was trying a bit too hard to be \"cool.\" 

Overall -- a good experience and will plan to return when I am back to visit Calgary another time."}
{"text":"The best place for steak in Calgary 

Love the lobster mashed potatoes and the lemon butter on my steak!!! 

Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This is a definite Steakhouse. Vancouver used to have a Saltlik but it got replace by Black and Blue. Vancouver location was not successful. But again this restaurant is owned by the Fuller Family. So its basically paying premium price and going to Joey/Earl/Cactus Club. Of course the décor is different.

So came here and ordered the Sirloin Steak and subbed the side with lobster mash which came to $42. Kind of pricy. For the amount of food I got. Also they charge for water as well. Bottle water. The lobster mash was good. Good amount of lobsters. The Sirloin was good (cooked the way I want it to be) but too much peppercorn which made it spicy. 

Décor was nice. Noticed most people who come here are all formally business dressed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. what's more can you ask from a restaurant. I got the beef carpaccio for appetizer and the filet mignon for main course. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"The ambience of this restaurant is incredible! Very easy to hold private and intimate conversations as the noise level is very manageable. Onto the food: the steak is absolutely fantastic, sides are incredible and most importantly, the service is fantastic. Morgan, our server, was incredibly engaging, very thoughtful and very attentive. The only reason this restaurant is not a five star was the tableware. When you order wonderful sides and a big steak, the plates need to be larger. Managing delicious sides and a big steak on a small plate is very difficult. Morgan and the entire team made our 25th wedding anniversary celebration a spectacular event. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food. Probably one of the best steaks I have ever had. At the suggestion of our server, we both had the lobster mash, which had 2oz of lobster on top, new york striploin (mine was peppercorn and my partner's was bleu cheese butter) and we shared a large skillet of mushrooms.

We were able to get in within 2 hours on a Saturday night. They happily accommodated us with our baby and everyone was pleasant. We had different staff check in to make sure everything was great throughout. Our server happily explained the different cuts, mentioned how they cook the steak. They happily packaged up my leftovers as the portions are very generous. The restaurant was loud enough by 730 that even if our baby was not sleeping (which he did) it would not have disturbed others, but not so loud as to not be enjoyable.

This was definitely a 4 and a half star visit.  Saltlik could improve by offering coat check or a place other than the back of your chairs to put jackets, as well as having staff pull out chairs when you first are seated. We appreciated the accommodation with our infant and clarification of amenities available.

This was our first visit, but after such a great experience this will not be our last!"}
{"text":"A really good restaurant in the heart of Downtown Calgary. My dinner was quite spicy and no where on the menu did it say it was spicy. Regardless, this is a very classy restaurant and I enjoyed my time at the restaurant. As for upscale restaurants go this one definitely is affordable. It has a really trendy ambiance and I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area! Kind of a hidden gem I would say."}
{"text":"Steaks.  Amazing Appetizers, great desserts: you're going to gain weight here and love every bite of it!"}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers I've ever had. Charred, matched with sharp cheddar and smokey bacon on a pretzel bun. Get it with duck fat fries. Yum!

Warm atmosphere, good service and value!"}
{"text":"A salt lick is where animals used to gather around to lick a bunch of salt before being shot right in the face by a hunter. One minute you're eatin' some delicious salt and the next thing you know you're up in elk heaven, clinking glasses with Bambi.

So it's an odd choice of a name for a restaurant. But let me put you at ease right away. Nobody comes out and shoots you in the face when you're done eating.

Instead what you'll find is a swanky little place with really delicious food that seems to actually put some \"care\" into how they serve their meals to paying customers. 

Now, for those of you who care about the aesthetics of the places you eat, let me paint a word picture for you. Careful, it's about to get all harlequin up in here:

Luxurious, spacious booths line the walls. You know you won't be crammed into an awful little Chinese finger trap like you would at Denny's. This makes you happy.  Waitresses smile at you with a twinkle in their eye and a slight swish in their step.  Is it love? Lust? The will to make more money in tips? You can't be sure, but something inside you ignites and before you know it you're smiling back like a glass-eyed, dimple-cheeked cherub. Click, click, click go the high heels. The sound of youth. 
There are fancy coat hangars. Someone very artsy also chose some paintings for the walls; you admire their finesse and panache and pleasing visual qualities. 

Woah! I'll pause here to let my readers take a cold shower or dab the sweat off their brows. what I'm trying to say is, it's a nice place.

To start, I ordered the popcorn shrimp. Now, this place could have gotten all Joey's Seafood on me and delivered a white plate towering with greasy shrimp straight from the fryer. But you know what those sly dogs did? They brought it to me in a retro popcorn box - one of those red and white striped ones - with popcorn on the bottom.

Now if you're wondering if shrimp + popcorn = delicious, it IS. I was wowed by the presentation. Brownie points.

After plowing through that like a man who had been on a desert island for months, I sipped my Keiths and awaited my main course: Chili-brushed ribs with shoestring fries. 

When it came, I was already impressed. A bountiful booty of golden fries and a giant rack of ribs. This place didn't mess around - for what I was paying I expected to leave full, and I would leave full indeed.

The ribs were perfect. A little heat to them, but a tenderness too. Like dating a successful businesswoman. Sure, she's got her image to keep up; can't look weak out there. But when you get her alone, she'll curl up beside you and plant butterfly kisses on your cheek.

Yes, that is how I'd describe my ribs. Like dating a businesswoman. Damn I'm good.

Everyone else I was with loved their meals as well. The steaks were cooked well. The pasta was flavorful and expertly prepared. The desserts looked absolutely amazing - but since 2012 is the year of the six pack, I opted out. Nothing tastes as good as handsome feels.

My twinkly-eyed waitress stopped by to make sure my glass was full, crack a few jokes and treat me like a boss.

In the end, I'd return to Saltlik. It could be a bit tough on the wallet for the budget-conscious, but for a night out, I'd put it up on the \"win\" list."}
{"text":"Saltlik is located on 8th Avenue Downtown Calgary.  It's definitely a prime location...especially because it's a few blocks walking distances to the Calgary Tower.  Parking is chaotic as it is downtown but that's expected.  After 6PM you are able to park for free across the street from Saltlik which is nice.  My gf and I were hitting up a show at the Vertigo Theatre so we decided to go for a bite close by before the show started.  There were a few places we were deciding from but Amanda suggested Saltlik.  I haven't been before so I agreed.

It was a Friday night, downtown...ahhh, what a headache it was looking for parking, all you do is go around in circles! You can also park underground of the Calgary Tower for a price, I think it's about ~$6 after 6PM.  OR if you get lucky just like I get lucky.....you will find street parking.  I parked across the street from Saltlik and went in to meet my gf who was already waiting for me.  

You are greeted by an open concept bar upon entering with loud but comfortable music.  My first thought was that this place seemed very modern with a casual setting.  Unfortunately we were seated at a two top by a door they use in the summer time so there was a little draft.  My gf was there a few minutes before myself and still hadn't received menus and when I met up with her we were looking around, waiting for someone to attend us.  It wasn't a good start to the night.  Finally, I believe the floor manager noticed us and told us he would alert the waitress right away and grabbed us some waters.  It appears that there was a bit of a miscommunication but our waitress was very apologetic and friendly.  Amanda had some questions as she has those darn intolerances and the manager and Makene were very accommodating.  They said that whatever her restrictions were, they would ensure they would do their best to make something she can eat that is tasty!  She went with the Chicken & Arugula salad which was grilled chicken breast, organic greens, it normally comes with avocado, artichokes & mozzarella but she substituted those for tomatoes and slivered almonds and she got the dressing on the side with a wedge of lemon.  I went with the Mushroom and Gruyere burger which came with French fries and I also ordered a side of seasoned broccolli.  Our food came out in a timely manner and it looked deeelish.  Even the plain salad A was having looked pretty appetizing!  The chicken was noticeable seasoned; the vegetables and greens seemed crispy and fresh!  A really enjoyed her salad; she mentioned it was satisfying and fresh.  I really enjoyed my burger, it was a beef all chuck patty with all the fixings on a soft seeded bun.  Tomatoes, lettuce, onions, mushrooms, delicious melted gruyere cheese.  Gruyere cheese is similar to swiss cheese, its sweet but slightly salty and it was very tasty on this burger.  The patty was salty and juicy and the mushrooms were sautéed for the perfect bite.  The fries were skinny, crispy, nicely seasoned shoe string fries which I love.  Just typing makes me want to eat a whole plate of those fries.  The seasoned broccoli was meh.  It seemed a little over seasoned with soggy broccoli but that's okay!  Makene was very attentive, stopping by often to top our glasses off and she was also very sweet!

Overall, Saltlik is a classy yet casual and comfortable restaurant.  You could either dress up for a night out or meet with friends for some drinks.  The booths seem fairly big; can probably fit up to 5 people, maaaaaybe squeeze in a 6th person.  I would totally love a work party here!  I'd say if you're in the area, give Saltlik a try OR if you hit up Banff, they have a location there as well!!  I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We went to the Chophouse for dinner last night.  All in all it was a good experience.  We had the tuna tartare which was fresh and flavourful.  My wife had the prawn pasta which she enjoyed.  I had a steak which was well cooked with a delicious baked potato.

The only downside to the experience was the service.  I didn't receive a steak knife for my dinner.  Our plates weren't cleared away until our next dish arrived, which meant we sat with empty plates in front of us for 10-15 minutes.

We found out after speaking with our server that two staff members hadn't shown up for work which gave everybody else more tables.  This is obviously not the fault of the staff, but it slightly tarnished the food experience.  Our server was literally out of breath from running around.  

I would recommend this place for the food.  The kitchen seemed to be well organized!"}
{"text":"In Calgary for the day. Wanted something convenient to Le Germain hotel to treat my daughter to. Saltlik hit it out of the Park. Cozy atmosphere sitting in a booth in front of the fireplace on an unseasonably cold Calgary night. The food was excellent. Steak was delicious, ribs tasty and fall off the bone and the hunter chicken looked good. Over and above the quality of the food was the service from the hostess to the staff busing the table to the waiter \"Ali\". We spent the night commenting on how attentive the staff were. Memorable evening thanks!"}
{"text":"Coming back here just for the wok fried calamari .. beats every calamari I ever tasted ...it's a must have when u r in Calgary .. sorry I ate it all up before clicking a decent picture"}
{"text":"The food at Saltlik is consistently good quality and tasty however the service is consistently terrible."}
{"text":"This restaurant went up in my eyes with this recent meal. I'd been to Saltlik before and it was always heavy on the chain and sodium, low on distinctivness or charm. 

In Calgary and needing a dinner that would deliver and be reasonably fast, I chose the Lick. It exceeded expectations. The servers sat me immediately, my waitress went beyond the canned politness and faux-joy found at many chains (are you listening Milestones?) and I had a pasta that actually was delicious (linguini with light cream sauce, bacon and asparagus). 

Would go back solely on the strength of this meal."}
{"text":"Been to Saltlik multiple time in the past.  Have always gotten the Filet (which is fantastic by the way), but wanted to get something different this time just to mix it up. 

Tried two appies, popcorn chicken (not bad, has popcorn on the bottom) and the dried ribs (not really dried, glazed with a sauce, VERY good and would definitely get again). 

Decided to get the Michaelangelo Chicken Penne.   Not too bad, sauce is a bit on the salty/oily side, but had some good flavour. Pasta was the right texture and the Chicken was cooked well. If I were to come back, I wouldn't get it again.   I'll stick to the Filet or the Ribs with Lobster Mash."}
{"text":"So I have I walked past the Saltlik so many times over the years and always think... \"that looks good\", but alas, never popped in. Finally, finally, I am so happy I did. Wow, all I can say is I was very impressed. 

First of all, I sat in the lounge at a booth and had fabulous service. We had a 2 bottles of California Cab Sav that were lovely. I ordered a Kobe meatball spaghetti dish that was just insanely good - craveable good! I can't wait to go back and eat this dish again! 

The restaurant from the outside looks a normal size, but then BAM, I went to the loo and holy-mole, they have this crazy cool \"rumpus-room/country club games room\" basement that is so cool. If you are looking to have a private party like a birthday or anniversary, well I would 100% recommend booking the basement. I only wish there was a place like this up in Edmonton."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night to celebrate my birthday with my fiancé. This is my second time here and I liked it much better this time around. The servers were all really friendly and helpful. We ordered the featured soup to start (mushroom) $7 and the house salad $8. I had the chicken and arugula salad (no chicken) and I like how they have a vegetarian option where they decrease the price of the salad since there is no meat on it. All restaurants should do this! My fiancé had the Prime Sirloin $37 and he had them cook it Chicago style which he loved. I believe it is med rare inside and charred on the outside. We had sides of: vegetables, mushrooms and broccoli. All were cooked very nicely. After dinner they brought out a dessert for my birthday. 
Overall, I will return to this restaurant. The food is tasty and portions are good for the price."}
{"text":"Very good place for great beef.. The carpaccio was delicious and the main course too. The wine was really good and The service was excellent!!... I definitely recommend this place..."}
{"text":"The best filet mignon I've ever had! 

Being in Calgary for business, my coworker and I got recommended to Saltlik by our hotel concierge.

We arrived and were promptly seated and served. Filet mignon was the chef's reco that day, so we both ordered it with the lobster mash. 

Our waitress came about 15 minutes later and told us the food might be a little late - but around 5-10 minutes later it arrived. Although we did appreciate her giving us a heads up on the potential delay.

Steak was phenomenal - cooked perfectly at medium rare, full of flavour and juice. Lobster mash had lots of little bits of lobster meat and was a great side dish.

I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Perfection! 

Comfortable atmosphere, juicy melt-in-your-mouth filet, and duck fat fries. 

The service is exceptional - personal and non intrusive.  

I will return here during my next trip to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Excellent... Again! Have never been disappointed here and i am pretty hard to please. Waitress suggested med rare rather than rare for rib eye. And was absolutely right, even though i often choose blue.

Not cheap but very very good"}
{"text":"Went there during the Big Taste for lunch and had a great experience. I'm not a steak person but I truly enjoyed the steak served for the Big Taste. The sticky toffee pudding is worth the visit alone. The service was outstanding and we managed to have a three course meal in just under an hour. Will certainly go again. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Nothing exceptional but nothing bad either.  Very comfortable interior, relaxing.  No kids menu but they were accommodating to minor substitutions for my kids.   Excellent cappuccino with dessert.  Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"The wood paneled ambiance aimed for high-end and celestial.  Steak was cooked to specification and tasted fine.  This place is good enough  to have a meeting with a CXX, VP of [blah] .  Food may be pricey but the conversations could be educational and worthwhile.   If you are looking for the greatest food at a down-to-earth price, may need to keep looking.  This is also within easy walking distance of the tower and nearby hotels so it is easy to go sightseeing afterwards before hitting the hay.  Should consider looking at other reviews in context as your experience could vary."}
{"text":"Went here with my SO for a holiday dinner together after seeing a play.  We really enjoyed the service, the ambiance, and the food."}
{"text":"I visited saltlik during a work dinner and was blown away with the quality of their food. The dinner exceeded my expectations. I will go back every chance I have as the flavour was phenomenal and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in without a reservation and they were happy to seat us right away even though they were quite busy. We had the  calamari appetizer that we both enjoyed. The Lamb was amazing and my wife loved the lobster mashed potatoes. 
The kitchen was quite slow and they did come and apologize. We had had an event to attend and they were again sorry and comped our appetizer. 
A little pricey, but overall enjoyed the food and service other than the speed."}
