{"text":"I'm trying to decide -- when it comes to pizza, am I a crust person or a topping person? If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate. We'll see where things fall in the great crust/topping dilemma next time I visit."}
{"text":"The smallest most expensive, barley average tasting pizza I ever had. 

$18 for a little small pie was a joke. They handed me this small box and I opened it up and I just started laughing. 

I think they should be a little less greedy and a little more humble on their pricing and portions.

My advise don't waste your time or your money. There are so many better pizza joints and this is just not one of them"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Humble Pie for a while and went for dinner there tonight and LOVED it! The food was great and the service was outstanding.   Highly recommend this restaurant and it is also very kid friendly! This will be a new fav on our list of great places to eat in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  nice looking, fun place, gorgeous patio set-up.  
Service:  our waiter, male with reddish brown hair was friendly and attentive.  Food deliverer, female with shoulder length brown hair, set food down and left; not much interaction with customers.
Food:  below average.  Chicken barbecue pizza had chewy chicken and bottom crust was too thin and gummy to hold thick toppings.  The rim crust was delicious. Barbecue sauce was tasty, zesty and sweet.  Bacon was bland and gummy.  Needs to be crispy, more flavor.  Cheese was cheap tasting (pasty tasting).
Price:  ridiculously expensive.  Two pizzas, appetizer and two sodas= $46!!!
Humble pizza has a price comparison to California Pizza Kitchen but food is way behind.  My favorite frozen pizza tasted better than our dinner at Humble Pizza.
After we ate, we walked out to the parking lot and saw Papa Murphy's was in the same shopping center.  We could've had a better tasting meal and a quarter of the cost."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great indoor-outdoor bar seating.  The SOP pizza was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have tried the Margherita pizza at many popular Phoenix restaurants that make it (because that's how you judge a Neopolitan-style pizza restaurant, right?)  and this is my favorite one.  I like it better than the much buzzed-about Pomo (too burnt), better than Il Bosco (too cheesy), MILES better than Sauce (just bad), better than the Parlor (too floppy), and possibly even better than the venerable Pizzeria Bianco (too pretentious maybe?).  The reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is that the d√©cor does not match the high quality of the pizza. Pretty much all of the places mentioned have nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good spot!  We rolled up at happy hour, which is a really good deal.  They've got a bunch of stuff for $3-6.50 for food, and good deals on drinks.

We had the crispy french fries and chicken drumettes for appetizers.  That would have been enough for a meal for two!  The fries were awesome, very crunchy and topped with parmesan.  Yum!  The wings were kinda sad, though.  The sauce was watery thin and didn't stick to the chicken at all.  And they were maybe a little overcooked.  Still edible... I ate just one and let my boyfriend eat the other seven.  :)

Then we had the potato and rosemary pizza.  Also yum!  It's a white pie with garlic, gorgonzola, rosemary, and sliced potato on top.  The crust is very good and I thought the pizza was really creative and delicious.

The service was really friendly and we had a nice time here!"}
{"text":"The egg pizza might be the most delicious pizza ever!! Love this place, staff is awesome, food is great and the atmosphere is cool and feels very neighborhood-y instead of chain restaurant generic."}
{"text":"Excellent service with Kyle and Leah!  The food was amazing and loved the happy hour prices.  The tempura green beams were excellent as well and the pizza.  I live in NE Mesa, but would go back tomorrow if I did not have to work.

Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Live in Ohio (10 years of bad pizza) visiting Scottsdale.  Native of Connecticut; home of American pizza: Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven, proximity to Lombardi's in Lower Manhattan. The tribunal epicenter of amazing pizza in the US.  Humble Pie in the blistering desert of southwest America: pizza worthy of a 5 star rating from an admitted pizza snob. House-made mozzarella, wood-fired ovens: pizza perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff was wonderful. We got the pepperoni pizza and Cesaer salad. Salad was great, pizza was okay. It wasn't the best pizza I ever had but it wasn't bad. As my husband put it \"didn't knock our socks off\". It seems like a nice date night place but if there was no where else to go. Like the feel of the place."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tuna Melt was delicious. The veggie pizza was amazing and the pizza with shrimp had a nice kick. Jeremy S must be making up his story because everything about this place was great"}
{"text":"The bruschetta was great!  The pizza however, was on par with Red Baron and Tombstone."}
{"text":"I live down the street, and I have been excited for them to open.  I've been in a few times and the service and food has been great. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Came during lunch, the first time...and while I was left waiting to be seated a little too long, the visit ended up good enough to warrant a return visit a couple of days later.  Lunch special the first day - Caesar Salad and (thought it could be a potential mistake that turned out VERY good) shrimp pizza.  Wonderful value in a high energy environment (don't come here for quiet).

Second visit was after lunch, but before dinner and this time I sat outside. Again, a little wait before I was noticed waiting to be seated, but that's my only complaint.  The spaghetti and meatballs spoke to me when I looked at the menu and it delivered!  Nice, thick gravy and the meatballs were perfect.  I'm a fan and will be back when next I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been to the one at the airport but never eaten, decided to finally try it as an actual dining experience. Walked in the place wasn't busy at all and very dark so we decided to sit at the bar where we could at least have some outside light. No Bartender and two staff members talking it up at the other service station. Nobody came over to greet us or ask us if we needed anything. We continued to wait for a bit then left without ever talking to anyone. It was on Sunday before Memorial Day around 6:30pm so there's no excuse. Not a good experience so ended up going to Sauce where it's always great."}
{"text":"I needed food for upcoming 6 hr connecting flight. Ordered the SOP, was informed of the $1 increase in price because of cheese prices (?). $17 bucks for a 9-in pizza? Already been on a plane for 5 hrs and pizza is easy on a plane, so whatever. Got pizza in 5 minutes but the crust and bottom was all burnt.  Asked very nicely if I could get a replacement as it was burnt. No argument was given, but did I have to pay!  Two hours into my flight and after half of pizza, I started getting severe stomach cramps and then proceeded to throw up every half hour on the plane. Then the diarrhea started. Still not feeling great. 
Tip? Don't eat at Humble Pie, and if you do, don't return a pizza as the cooks are vindictive jerks."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to stop for take out or dine in with the family. When I was in EMS we would always stop by and grab a pizza to go. They are personal sized with extremely satisfying flavor. My girls each have a favorite pizza with the marguerita pizza being a huge hit. Last night I stopped by to order takeout and sat at the bar while I waited. The bartender was delightful and carried great conversation. 

I tried the mozzarella appetizer for the first time yesterday and it was amazing. We also tried the BBQ chicken pizza for the first time as well. It had a spicy kick to it yet always still a big hit my with girls. This place remains my go to when I'm not sure what else to get."}
{"text":"We had a great experience when we went here for lunch. All of the food was very good -- from the salads to the bruschetta to the pizza. Our waiter was also very helpful and attentive. I only wish they had gluten-free options for pizza!"}
{"text":"Burnt pizza?? Like black ash on the bottom. How did that even make it out of the kitchen? Long wait for the \"pie\" so I didn't demand another. Nobody at our table of 12 was impressed. The only thumbs up was a salad that a friend ordered. Kinda ruined my wife's birthday dinner. Horrible. Gave it a second chance at the Happy Valley location.  Even worse. I wrote that review on their review page. Wow!"}
{"text":"Gave it a second chance. I didn't order pizza because its not a pizza place. I tried the spaghetti and meatballs.  If you like bland spaghetti from a can, you are going to love it! The attraction on this dish should've been the meatballs..... no. The were bad. Tasted like the smell of canned dog food. I want so badly for this trendy place to be good, but its only good for alcohol and dessert. No third chance. Good luck."}
{"text":"Our family was in the mood for pizza so we called and ordered a large pizza for pickup. Upon pickup the box seemed more like a medium and we should've checked the size of the pizza before we left. When we got home and opened it up the pizza was much smaller than the small box....6 small slices. Enough to feed half our family. We called and the person on the phone said they only had one size pizza.,,,we asked why didn't the person tell us that when we ordered a large on the phone order and got no response.
Pizza quality - not very good, we've had Chicago style, NY style and pizza from all over. This tasted like doughy, school cafeteria pizza
Price - high, $14 for 6 small slices only fed half my family 
Service - poor, we ordered a large size on the phone and were never told they only had one small size

The place was busy inside and I know they get a lot off good reviews but hoping another family does not have the same experience we had."}
{"text":"Although not even close to my first choice for Phoenix Pizza, I wasn't at all disappointed with Humble Pie.  As I remember it, the pizza was great and they had enough beers on tap to make me happy."}
{"text":"Horrible service! It took 10mins for anyone to even acknowledge that we were seated. I had to flag someone down and ask for a waiter.  Then a guy came over and said he would be our server after the bus boy got our order..never to see the waiter again. They forgot my husbands beer order, never refilled our waters (we had to flag them down again and ask) I had to mention my husband never got his beer....the bus boy came over with it later and said he gave it to the wrong table. My husband was so over it by that point he said he didn't want it, he just wanted our check.  And then they proceeded to STILL put the beer on our check. We have eaten here before and had  mediocre service,  but this was just plain AWFUL.  No one was even overly apologetic about how awful their service was, even after we showed our frustration multiple times.  Not impressed!"}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a great place to visit in Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. Fun and attentive staff that connect with you the minute you walk in. 

I had the strawberry Gorgonzola salad and was really pleased. You must get the pretzel. The mustard dipping sauce is yum. 

The bartenders are AWESOME! So friendly that they have many regulars who they ask about their kids, trips they took, etc. It's such a great atmosphere after a long trip. Definitely my new fave when going in and out of Phoenix. 

I used to wish for terminal D flights. Now I will wish for Terminal C gates 1-9."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had the lunch special pie and salad. The salad was very good with lots of all the ingredients! The pizza was great and they completely cover the pie with all the goodies you ordered. 

Our servers name is Jack and he was very cool and friendly.  

Defiantly coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but horrible service. It always seems like the kitchen can not understand an order. Pair that with severely overpriced basic items that makes it a place to stay away from"}
{"text":"Food is so good! Drinks are okay but don't hold up for the pricing. If you like a good burger come here."}
{"text":"This place had mixed reviews but I gave it a shot and sad to report I got to worst of it. I went for their lunch special; first we were sat without water for 10 mins before she came back to even ask us about drinks. After that we got our appetizer the calamari which wasn't bad (not the best not the worst). Then my \"white\" veggie pizza came out...it smelled terrible it was sopping in olive oil and I couldn't bare to eat more than one piece. The buffalo pizza my partner got was to heavy on the sauce and almost no chicken. The wait staff took their sweet time to get us the check and didn't even ask how the meal was. I can think of a thousand places with better pizza and service."}
{"text":"I go to Humble Pie very often and I prefer their Phoenix (7th St) location by far. I have never had an issue with their staff, food, or drinks. My usual go-to is their original Bruschetta, Margherita Pizza with cherry tomatoes baked in the pizza, and a glass of wine or Kilt Lifter. I recently tried their S.O.P. Pizza and it was delicious! Another favorite would be their Grilled Chicken Pesto pizza (I like it best with red sauce). Their fries and fried calamari are also pretty yummy! 

Keep an eye out on Groupon- they're constantly offering good deals for certain locations!"}
{"text":"Great food! Tuesdays are the best, they have live music on the patio and drink specials. The fig and prosciutto pizza is especially awesome."}
{"text":"Meh....it's alright. Would probably give if only two stars if it weren't do close to my neighborhood.  I'd likely go back for happy hour with my gals.  Pizza was ok. Wine was good. And there is a very yummy baked to order chocolate chip cookie with ice cream."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great tacos and enchiladas. Meat or vegetable fillings. You have to try their sweet and spicy cornbread."}
{"text":"I posted a review out of frustration and disappointment and was ready to not return to this business. Having been a long time resident of this neighborhood I really want this business to succeed because I really want to have that neighborhood connection and a place to belong after a long work week. So, after a short hiatus my partner and I returned, genuinely hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Thankfully, we were not disappointed! There is a new KM who has swiftly addressed the food quality consistancy. Omg, we have had some delightful flavors that have lingered and tempted us to return again 2 nights later. Theron, the bartender has delivered quality and charm and has made our experience wonderful. Leigha, our server is always attentive, thoughtful, and gracious. We are happy to be back and appreciate a place that we look forward to enjoying. I have been trying to choose 5 stars for this review but for some reason only 3 will respond."}
{"text":"Disappointing. 

Waiter was clearly stoned. Didn't remember our drink orders. Twice. Forgot our appetizers. Was loud and trying to be way too funny and missing the mark. 

We were seated right next to the servers computer and were privy to all the staffs comments about customers. 

Food was respectable but not overly impressive. Drinks were good. Disappointing dining experience because of the staff. Our second time in and most likely our last."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new establishment next to my bank. Saw these \"now open\" signs. Went in and loved the decor, staff, and ambiance. Looked over the menu, saw that they had more than pizza on the menu. Decided on a meat lovers pizza and soup, which happened to be a lunch special. Had the steak and turkey chili soup. It was spiced just right. Pizza was great too. Fresh mozzarella was a pleasant surprise. 
I will be returning to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"You will not be sorry getting a pie here. No pizza as that refers to another business. This is a business in Avon Lake that make pies (Apple, peach...) and these are the best pies I have ever eaten and I have tried several varieties. She uses all primo and when possible local ingredients. Expensive and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Pizza is a hard category to one up in because there are so many options but..yum! Humble Pie is a great pizzeria that offers fun and different options to help change things up from the usual. If you want a good example, I recently tried the fig and prosciutto pizza. It was amazing and cooked so well! A great choice whether youre in the mood to sit inside or outside and the staff is always incredibly friendly from hostess to server."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and they are a good stop for a pizza craving. Their woodfired pizzas are flavorful. Unless starving, one pizza serves two. Their toasted ravioli's are a great appetizer. Tried sitting outside last time but there was a weird swarm of bees on the patio but had no problems being moved inside."}
{"text":"As the food was good and our waiter gave us great service, our initial introduction to this airport restaurant was not the best. We asked to sit in the inner part of the restaurant and the hostess told us that the food tastes the same at every table. Though she is correct, we wanted a relaxing table at another area and were willing to wait for a table. The same thing happened to another table of two as they were arriving. The hostess should be the friendliest person in the whole restaurant. Please have a talk with your hostess."}
{"text":"hubby and I went for a quick lunch yesterday-our server was new(3 days new she said)and was trying to do well-It wasn't as full as I'd have thought being spring training month but we tried it. Don't care for the concrete floors. The sliding of chair legs is annoying and loud. One of the other servers (young&blonde)kept sliding them too!AND slamming the plates down on table to re-set.(things like that make or break a good experience)Let's see, hubby got a glass of beer ($4 for 12 oz.)and I had iced tea.We ordered pizza, of course, that has too thin crust for us - have to eat it with a fork so all toppings don't fall off!I had organic veg and I ate it but probably won't again. Hubby liked his meat lovers.We had a choice of this place or the one next door which looked more of a sports bar - probably gonna try the sports bar next time."}
{"text":"When I am in Phoenix this is a must have for me.  The happy hour special is what got me going there and the food and drinks keep me coming back.  The pepperoni is my all time favorite with overlapping petite pepperonis that curl up into little bowls.  The appetizers and salads are also tasty."}
{"text":"This is not the quality of the Humble Pie at Desert Ridge or the Scottsdale road location not even close. First of all this one is not a wood fired pizza place like the other two. It's just a pizza oven from the pizza place that use to be there before so not good. Second the crust is not good due to the pizza oven and the quality of meet is bad. Save your money for Bianco or Cibo downtown for amazing wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Pesto Pizza! Plus a drink 19.50 Worst Pizza I have ever had! Not worth it honestly plus I figured giving the place a try I regret it! Poor decision on my part do not go! Any chef or cook would throw up this pizza no flavor at all. CHEF RAMSEY would not even eat it just by the look of it!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. The sauce and cheese are delicious making an awesome pizza. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was our waitress was a bit clueless. She was being rude but you could tell she had no idea she was doing it. Other than that I loved the place and will be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with friends. I can't comment on the pizza as no one had any. Two of us had the tuna melt and one had the sourdough burger. Everyone was thoroughly happy. Who would think that adding their signature olives to the tuna melt would be so tasty!

Service was fantastic....really really attentive. 

The only negative was you feel kind of crammed in since the tables are closely set together."}
{"text":"Walked in at 8:40pm and female bartender looked at her watch and said kitchen is only open for 4 more mins. Website and Yelp says they are open till 10pm. She had no interest in serving our family of 4. Very disappointed. We have hosted several group parties here."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area so this was my first culinary venture in the 'hood. Happy starts at 11:00 am?!?! What a delight!!! 
My daughter and I each had the Express lunch, 10\" pizza with half salad. I had the strawberry and goat cheese salad and she had the Caesar. Both were so delicious! 
For pizza I had the prosciutto and fig pizza which was a lot of fun. I didn't think I would eat the whole thing In one sitting but I did!
My daughter had the pepperoni and her only complaint was she thought there were too many pepperonis on her pie. I don't see how that could be a bad thing but some kids are funny that way!
They had some other interesting combinations and I'll surely be back to try them all!!!"}
{"text":"On January 4, twenty of my friends and I had a dinner at Humble Pie on 7th Street.

Two days before the date, I spoke to someone who took my original reservation for 15 w/o any problems. I also informed her that we will want separate checksI'm sure, to which she said that it wouldn't be a problem. On 1/4 around 2 p.m.., I called again to confirm the reservation at 5 p.m. and also informed the guy on the other line that the reservation will now be for 20 not 15. He said it wouldn't be a problem, but noticed that the note on the reservation said \"separate checks.\" He then said that Humble Pie CANNOT do separate checks for groups of 8+ because that's their policy. I wish that I was given the correct information when I first called because that would've changed my decision to have the dinner there. Some of my guests were just going to stop by and not stay long for dinner. At that point, it was too late to find a place and inform all 20 guests of the change, so I stuck with it. But for the record, I was already annoyed that a staff member did not know an important restaurant policy that should've been ingrained from the firstday of training. The reasoning I was given for the \"one check policy\" was: \"You only have one server for the evening...\". That sounded like a recipe for poor customer service.

Well, that's pretty much what we got that evening.

1. As a guest was finishing up his Kiltlifter, he noticed that there was a piece of \"ice\" at the bottom of the glass, which he thought was odd for beer. As he got the piece of \"ice\" in his mouth, he realized it was a piece of broken glass. Luckily, my guest is so even-keeled that when he informed our waitress that evening of the broken glass, he didn't make a big fuss and just told the waitress to inform the bartender in case there are other shards lying around. She said that earlier in the day, a glass or two did break/shatter and the piece was probably one of the remnants. My other friend then got worried and checked her Kiltlifter from the bottom and noticed that the bottom of her pint glass was cracked. 

The incident was clearly NOT the waitresses' fault and she quickly told us that both beers will not be charged. My guests were grateful and they each received another pint of Kiltlifter. Luckily, my guest didn't order a diet Coke first, which is his usual, because if he had, he wouldn't have even seen that piece of glass coming, and probably sucked on it like ice. But he didn't make a fuss because well, sh*t happens.

2. Then the SAME guest ordered his burger with no cheese because of dairy allergies. Everyone ordered pizza or wings. People got their food served, but an HOUR AND A HALF after he placed his order, he still hadn't gotten his burger. Again, the waitress was apologetic but at that point he didn't want the burger. You would think that they'd give him extra attention after the glass incident, but no. He didn't say anything because that isn't his personality and he knew that I would be upset. And since it was my birthday dinner he didn't make a fuss to ruin the evening. Some of my guests asked for water and that was a little difficult to get, too. 

3. After all this inconvenience, we were hoping that they could honor our request for separate checks. But there were inconsistencies--some were granted that request and then some were not. Frustrating! To be honest, she was good for the most part doing her job solo. She probably would've gotten a 20+% gratuity anyway from each of the guest

Now imagine this concept, if there were maybe  2 servers or maybe 1 1/2 servers for our party, the poor service wouldn't have happened. One of them would've noticed that while everyone else was eating, one guest wasn't. Our waitress was not only waiting on our tables but other tables as well.

Humble Pie, look at it from our perspective: my guest, who sucked on a piece of broken glass and was not served his burger (but instead a consolation pepperoni pizza, which, according to the waitress, was ordered but she can't figure out who ordered it, but it didn't matter anyway because my guest is allergic to dairy) was forced to pay part of the gratuity that was included in the bill. For bad service.

And we're not faulting the waitress, who was working her a** off that evening, we fault poor management. I think you've done her a disservice because she seems awesome, but physically, you can only do so much. 

I've supported this establishment when it was The Living Room and I wanted to support  Humble Pie because I support local. Sometimes good food is not enough.  Anyone can get \"good food\" anywhere and they are plentiful out there, but selling an experience is an art. I'm not complaining because I'm asking for compensation or a freebie. But I am asking you to consider how you manage the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good, for pizza you can't beat Grimaldi's.  We tried the soup, toasted raviolis and chopped salad, meh on everything."}
{"text":"I ordered the express lunch as usual. The strawberry Gorgonzola salad was excellent, but my BBQ pizza was dry and seemed to have the wrong balance of cheese, BBQ sauce and chicken. My friends buffalo chicken was great, so I would say that there has to be a new chef or something. Service was good, no problem there."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this location. I went for date night for my third visit and must say it's a good deal, but service was lousy.  We were seated quickly and served drinks. Was told the appetizer of raviolis came with six but only five were on the plate when served. Salads were good but chopped celery in a caesar salad? The Margherita pizza was ok. The cheese was unevenly distributed on the pizza and the sauce did not cover the crust evenly. speaking of crust, the outer edge was very bulky and burnt. Everyone working seemed to be in a hurry to get their sidework done and get out. No teamwork from other servers as far as bussing and saying hello to guests other than their own. Our server seemed lost or frazzled. Might go back but this could be a typical crash and burn place as far as service."}
{"text":"Not as good as last time, but still worthwhile!
We hadn't been here in a while (since winter) and were so looking forward to the caprese salad, featuring mozzarella burrata.  Not your usual caprese--in a bowl you get EVOO, some balsamic, good pesto and a heaping amount of burratta, along with cherry tomatoes and  some rustic bread.   It was still very exceptional, but not as good as we remembered.  I think last time they roasted the cherry tomatoes so you could spread them on the bread (yummy!), but this time they were just left raw--so if you tried to spread them (or cut into them), they spurted everywhere (almost ruined my shirt).  They don't give enough bread with this dish, so ask for extra.  This item is not on the happy hour menu, but is definitely worth full price!  We also had the chicken wings (spicy), which were pretty good.  My only complaint on happy hour was that their signs had wine at $5, but it isn't ALL wine and I wasn't informed of that.   So be sure to ask which wines are at the HH price.   Draft beer was cold and good.  A big local crowd, seems like the staff here has great relationships with the patrons.   Get there early to get a seat at the bar.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Went back to this location.  Service was much better but I must admit, I'm not enamored with their pizzas.  Part of the problem may be that a few friends have recommended Humble Pie (not this location) and therefore I may have had lofty expectations.  However, I think I'm going to have to hold off on Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Party of 5 and they took forever to seat us. Yet place was empty and all they had to do was move some empty tables together. Then took forever to place an order. Waitress ignored us. Ordered fried mozzarella which was very good. Pizzas were just ok but considering price should have been better. Waitress never checked back in. I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The bartender was very rude.  Music wasn't family friendly. Place looked like a sleazy strip bar.  Lights were so low I could barely see my husband.  We just wanted a nice dinner after work...and this place was such a disappointment. To top it all off they didn't even honor their own advertisement that was on the table - half off pizza on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"we ordered two pizzas and a pretzel for takeout...$40 later and still hungry.....the Margherita pizza was a joke.   There was so little sauce on the crust that it was baked dry and the mozzarella cheese looked like plastic and had no taste.  The few shreds of basil were blackened and a pitiful effort, why even bother.  The pretzel was dry, cakey, and tasteless.  The second pizza was a little better because it had sausage and fennel on it but the ricotta we asked to have added was nowhere to be found and the mozzarella was shiny and tasteless like on the Margherita Pizza.  We will never order from here again. Not worth it even if it had been free."}
{"text":"The service was the best thing about our meal. We tried several appetizers and pizzas for the table and everything was really low quality. For example, they use those artificially dyed bright red and green olives in their assorted olive appetizer. Also, I do expect more than two kinds of olives when it says \"assorted.\" Not a huge deal, but it perfectly exemplifies the kind of quality we got in each and every dish for the rest of the night, like jarred mayo where it says \"aioli,\" etc. I did like the dough on the pizza,but the toppings on each pie were really lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a decent beer selection. Wait staff was fantastic and extremely gregarious. I strongly recommend asking for Doug and sitting at the bar if you'd like to know more about what there is to do around Phoenix. 

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We enjoy frequenting Humble Pie in Peoria.  The service is great and Haley has become our favorite server.  She is entertaining and attentive.  As one of your most consistent customers, we are disappointed by the changes in your menu.  You no longer serve that delicious turkey steak chili, and now have shifted away to a different version of doughnut holes.  We have lost two favorite items on the menu and request you reconsider bringing them back."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed lunch. Being new to AZ (just moved here from so cal) I am trying all the local spots and avoiding chains. THe food was pretty good. I was there during lunch and very much a suit and tie lunch spot. Food was good, not great. Salads are amazing, but thin crust pizza not as good as CKP or even sauce. Good spot to try I guess if looking for something new, but not a regular spot."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni pizza.  it was terrible.   The dough was undercooked in the center and the crust was overcooked.  The sauce tasted like tomato paste right out of the can.  Very disappointing.  A lot of great reviews, maybe I went on a down day."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here even with the \"MANAGER\" ... ( she showed little interest in making the customer happy after a bad experience) the server messed up and charged incorrectly and had to refund us that amount, the charge the card again. The manager said the money refunded to you will be available 3 bus day, but we still need to charge your card for the other amount. We explained to her that it was a lot of money for it to be charged twice and wait 3 bus days for the refund. She simply stated with a smile on her face \"there is nothing else I can do\". Very rude and unpleasant... didn't do anything to make us come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale. The Pizza is great and if you go at lunch there lunch special pizza and salad is great!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here about ten times, and have to say that I've noticed a definite improvement in service the last two or three times.  Not that it was ever bad, but moreso inconsistent/slow.  The food has always been excellent, so I am glad to see the service now match the caliber of amazing cuisine they offer.  I keep trying to branch off the SOP pizza, but it's very hard to do when it's such a delicious choice!  Sandwiches are also great, and you WILL get your money's worth on mixed drinks (I normally order a pop with my rum and coke and will keep mixing it in because they have a very heavy-handed bartender. It's like getting two drinks for the price of one).  There are Humble Pies now all over the valley, so I highly suggest trying one!"}
{"text":"I took my mother and wife for dinner on a Thursday evening acting on a recommendation from a family member. For starters, the menu is DIFFERENT but not nearly as bad as the food! Very slow service topped off a miserable dinner. We have another $12 Groupon coupon that is definitely going to go to waste. Dan S."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place on our side of town as we've had takeout from another location and loved it. 

We came in and there was a wait for a two top. No biggie, we both got a glass of wine and waited just a short while before our table opened up. We sat down having had maybe 4 sips of our wine. 

We waited. 

And waited. 

We had our wine....


But no menus. 


I joked that it was like Costa Rica and the slow service there. I was in a good mood and happy to sit down after a long day on my feet. 

Still with the waiting.


No... STILL MORE with the waiting!

Now it was not funny anymore and we were being completely ignored. I checked my clock and it was 7:57pm. Clearly not a closing time issue. I tried to assuage my companion by telling him how tired I used to get after a big rush and they were probably trying to catch their breath. 

Yeah... that argument only holds weight for so long before you realize you've still been sitting there with a glass of wine from the bar and NO MENUS OR ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE. Seriously the guy who seated us was really nice. Where was he?

A girl came around and put place settings out at 4 tables. ALL AROUND US. 

Still. No service. 

Fuck. Are you kidding me? I was seriously patient. I know what working in the service industry is like. This is ridiculous. 

\"If we finish our glasses of wine and no one has said a single word to us... we are leaving\". 

\"But you are not allowed to chug your wine\". 

\"Deal\".

{{{insert witty conversation for 5 minutes}}}

Alright. All done. We have not sped up our drinking. We were very fair and patient... up we go. 

And we left. 

Would you have done anything different?"}
{"text":"Really another very good lunch! Tried the pizza this time  10\" Sausage-Onion-Pepper and I was impressed. Great crust and very good ingredients.  Much better than expected and I am a super critic with pizza due to my Chicago roots. 
Service was great again! Love their outdoor area"}
{"text":"We are very fortunate to have so many amazing pizza restaurants here in the valley and I was really hopeful about this place because of its proximity to my house. The staff was friendly and attentive and the live music added nicely to the ambiance. The food arrived quickly but did not look very appetizing. The mac 'n' cheese from the kids' menu looked like it came right out of a box, although I didn't taste it to verify. The crusts on our pizzas had great texture and flavor but the toppings were bland and dry. Overall, I wasn't impressed and would prefer to drive a little further out for pizza next time."}
{"text":"I like Humble Pie. The ambiance is that trademark Arizona upscale/casual where wine swilling 40-somethings get can get a bit rowdy after a bottle or two. That's my code for don't expect a quiet dining experience, unless you go later in the evening.  

The pizzas overall are quite good -- chewy crusts, balanced sauces and quality cheeses. I find the meat toppings to be a little hit or miss. It's hard to go wrong with the Schriner's Sausage, but I found the pepperoni to be a bit greasy and cut way too thick, and the prosciutto slices so large/stringy as to be a choking hazard. I refuse to use silverware to eat pizza, even in a classy pizza joint like this, so perhaps the Heimlich is in my future. 

If you want to control costs, order one of their special pizzas (unless you like it super simple.) The pricing on their choose-your-own-topping pizzas can easily get out of control -- piecing together my favorite toppings resulted in a $16 pizza. Yikes! 

Star-wise my review is somewhere between a 3 and 4. I'm giving Humble the bump for their Monday night half-price wine specials. The wine list has an excellent variety, and we've indulged in plenty of their top-tier bottles ... at 50 percent off, you'd be crazy not to."}
{"text":"Tish stopped in my office with brochures and such a friendly personality I had to stop in! I was greeted by Kendall who's was amazing and helped me choose my order with great recommendations. The pizza was fresh and delicious I loved that they had such a unique and tasty menu I definitely recommend they also serve adult beverages with happy hour! A+++"}
{"text":"THe atmosphere is very appealing and pleasant.  We normally sit at the bar as it is just the two of us on most occasions.  The music is appropriate, lighting is set and the staff has always been friendly.  

We have tried a number of different pies on the menu (Shrimp, Chicken, Pepp, Meat Lovers, BLT and many others) and they have always come out quick and delicious.  The fried green beans and veggie salad is also very good if your looking for something different.  

The prices for the pie seem a little high for the size that arrives at the table.  The ingredients are most certainly fresh, so that might add to the cost.  The cost for a restaraunt to make a pizza is very low!  It obviously hasn't kept us from coming back.  We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Friday.

Service - quick, friendly, helpful and attentive

Caesar salad - delicious! Dressing was not overpowering. Sour dough croutons were a little soft so they didn't shatter and tasted great. Thin slices celery added a little crispy crunch that was nice. Portion size was good

Pizza- signature sausage had a nice little kick but nothing overpowering. The sauce, cheese, onions were all in nice proportion. The crust was beautiful and was tasty

Beverage - Coca Cola products which are a huge plus in my opinion"}
{"text":"casual lil pizza joint in scottsdale. the pizza selection was pretty good. we ordered a potato pizza with bleu cheese and a shrimp pizza. both were pretty good, thin crust, nothing amazing though. the waiter was pretty slow...but they opened not too long ago, so i assume they're still working out all of the kinks. 

i would rather hit up bianco, la grande orange or sauce."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff.    Fantastic lunch specials and best IPA in town on tap.  Sundays are great for families too.  Kids eat free.  Don't miss the fig and prosciutto pie.  To die for."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night.  I love the look of the restaurant. The outer patio furniture was very welcoming and on a nice night as last night was, very pleasing.   We were quickly served drinks while on the patio and no sooner did we get our drinks we were ready to be seated. I also like the restaurant itself.  It is small and maybe a little cramped as some reviewers as noted, but I had no problem with it.  I also really enjoyed the indoor/outdoor bar.

Why only 3 stars?  Because the food was only ok.  Not great.  The thing that makes a great pizza is a very flavorful crust that can only be achieved when the dough is allowed to ferment for 3-4 days.  It is lactobacilli that creates a flavorful dough, and that takes time.  This was bland.  The texture of the dough was awesome, but I missed the deep flavor that the dough should have.  I ordered the Margherita as that is the pizza I use to judge a pizza place.  Unfortunately I was less than impressed.  No whole basil leaves, just thinly sliced basil that did not transfer its flavor to my taste buds.  My wife had the same pie and felt the same about her's as well.  My son had the cheeseburger and thought it was only just ok, the burger didn't taste too beefy.

Our server was a very nice young man but I wished he had mentioned their Thursday night special (1 appetizer, 2 salads, and 1 pizza for $20) because we didn't notice their POP card on the table.  Not a big deal, but it would have nice.

I will probably go back as I really enjoy the environment, but will probably stay clear of the pizza right now."}
{"text":"Love this place! Roasted mushroom pizza is great! Also loved the strawberry 
Gorgonzola salad!"}
{"text":"The food was yummy!
1. Butternut squash soup was great but overpriced for how much you get
2. The fries are delicious!! It's helpful when you go during happy hour to get them cheaper.
3. The turkey salad had a lot of flavor and was big enough to share as an appetizer with our table.
4. The artichoke pizza was good and the crust is sweet.
We will go back with a Groupon because we liked the food but overall is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of humble pie.  But strictly for the pies cause I'm way too cheap to spend $7 for a side of fries.  

I love the charred sourdough flavor of the crust here.  It's a great choice for when I don't have 2 hours to invest in waiting for Pizzeria Bianco or deal with the crazy parking at LGO.

One thing I don't get here is the olive oil gelato.  I'll take it on faith that they actually put a drop or two of olive oil in there, but I can't freaking taste it."}
{"text":"Well as I was eating lunch at this wonderful place I came across the best pizza in town! Very soft music and a great staff! Our server, Lorine,  is a wonder wonderful human being and very outgoing.  I would definitely come back not just for the pizza but for the great service we received by our server."}
{"text":"Very sad that gluten free crust any available topping.  Crust needs something more to be pizza. Had to leave to get dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for casual, but fun, dinners / lunches / meetings, etc. I love the menu &  the prices are fantastic for what you get! The decor is dark and intimate, but you feel very welcome and at home there. They have a great bar for watching games, a glass of wine with a friend, or even just to unwind after a long day."}
{"text":"Overpriced crap. Decent quality on ingredients but was more like burnt breadsticks with to much sauce.payed an extra dollar for basil didnt even get a whole leaf worth on a pie.5extra dollars for one with actuall topping (sausage and carmaziled onions) and they only had a scattered couple of those on pie."}
{"text":"Humble Pie has quickly turned into one of my favorite restaurants in the midtown area. The food is terrific; I'm addicted to the tuna sandwich, and the lunch half-sandwich special is a great deal. You basically get a whole sandwich with a corner cut off plus a salad. And of course the pizza is cravable too. But what inspired me to write this review is the staff, who has been consistently friendly and accommodating. We had a birthday party there, and Aimee took amazing, patient care of everyone there. Rebecca and the other bartenders and waitstaff are also committed to making the guest have a great experience. Plus, they have great happy hour specials. It's a good place."}
{"text":"Food was good, service sucked! This restaurant is run by a bunch of incompetent teenagers. We saw our waiter throw out garbage in feont of the restaurant several times, come back in and serve food without washing his hands. When I called and asked about stipulations on groupons they said they were good ANY time. I even specified \"date night\" Thursdays and they said \"YES\" groupons are accepted. We go to eat there and give our waiter the groupon and he said they wouldn't take it. Then he said he would ask the manager and came back and said \"NO\" again. We asked to speak to the manager and saw him get some girl feom the patio who was in the middle of smoking a cigarette and drinking. She came in reeking of cigarette smoke and said she would accept our groupon. Very unprofessional and horrible hospitality. Won't be back to this location EVER again."}
{"text":"Friendly service, a nice dark beer, and a nine slice BLT. Prices are reasonable for an airport restaurant;if you are eating on a budget you're looking at corn nuts and coke. If you want a large drink and good sandwich at the end of the C concourse, you could do far worse and not much better than Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Food was awesome however the service definitely needs work. Our waiter had absolutely no personality and never once asked us how everything was. He definitely seemed annoyed that he even had to help us. What could've easily been a great experience, resulted in an ok one."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times now.  Mostly for lunch.  They have a great lunch special , and a stamp card for regulars.  I haven't had any of the service issues that others have reported, so I can't speak to that.  The staff has been great time every time I have been there.  

If your into french fries you HAVE to get these ! Order the happy hour fries anytime to receive the golden crispy deliciousness sprinkled with seasonings and pecorino cheese, not a big messy pile of goopy cheese fries either, one you can actually pick up and eat without making a mess.  They are served with awesome aioli too so be sure not to miss it. 

My staple lunch order here is Fig and prosciutto pizza with butternut squash soup.  The pizza is the perfect balance, sweet fig goat cheese and their house made mozzarella and prosciutto makes everything better right ???   the soup is just a hint of sweet from a bit of cinnamon.  

They  have a sausage made for them by Schreiner's( another local company ) It's to die for !!!  They have plenty of Veg only selections too so no worries if you bring a mixed group."}
{"text":"Humble Pie fills the nitch of the high-quality neighborhood pizza joint and bar for Desert Ridge, much like LGO Pizzeria in Arcadia and Patsy Grimaldi's in DC Ranch. I dined at the original location once and must say I liked that space better, but I'm thrilled to have this location closer to home. The chilled green bean app is wonderful - prepared just like they do in France, with a light mustard sauce. Their salads are great, too. I've had the delicious chopped salad with turkey, salami, and cheese, and on my most recent visit, I had the awesome new summer strawberry gorgonzola salad. Of course, a place called Humble Pie must serve up some terrific pizzas, and they sure do, in many unique varieties. There are some more gourmet choices, like the prosciutto and pear and the shrimp pizza, which I had on my latest visit. The shrimp had a lightly sweet taste to it that really complimented the savory cheese. My only complaint is that the dough was slightly undercooked...it looked white as snow. There's nothing too gourmet about the pizza with Schreiner's sausage, but it's amazing! Their tomato sauce is great and you can't go wrong with top-quality sausage from a local producer. And when done right (unlike my last visit), the crust is golden brown, soft and crispy at the same time, and has a hint of sweetness. This place is offering some killer specials right now -- from nightly specials (like Tuesday's free half salad or app) to the $8.95 lunch special to their coupons -- so take advantage of the savings and enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"Pizza was average. They do what a lot of places do,  they put your freshly cooked, crispy pizza directly on a plate or in a box and It proceeds to get soggy,  especially in the middle. Then when I went to pick up a slice,  the first half of the toppings fell off!  I wouldn't recommend the pizza. The toppings were decent (not great) and the sauce was \"so-so\".
The Calamari on the other hand was really good. A little expensive at $9.99 but really good. 
I would go back for happy hour,  i just wouldn't order a pizza."}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about this place, so I decided to meet a friend here for dinner last night. It is a very cute place, but that's about it.  We sat there waiting for at least 10 minutes until somebody came up and took our drink order. We decided on splitting the caesar salad, macaroni and cheese and margherita pizza. All the food came out in a timely manner which was a plus because we were starving. The salad was your typical caesar sald. The macaroni and cheese was DROWNING in sauce and looked disgusting, but the pizza looked decent. We dug in on the macaroni and cheese first which had no flavor and we had to fish for our noodles because there was so much sauce. The pizza was the only decent thing about this place.  

Needless to say, there are much better pizza places out there so I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!!! Love the food, atmosphere, and the service. My husband and I would always go on Tuesdays for half of pizza and for the two lovely bartenders. Kendal and Haley are very entertaining and made EVERY experience enjoyable. The pizza is delicious as well as the cocktails."}
{"text":"I love the use of lemon zest to lighten up a pizza especially as the weather gets warmer.  There was a light sprinkle of it on my clam pie even though it was not mentioned in the menu and it was also on the shrimp pie as well as the olive oil gelato in a candied version.  

The clam pie was a little disappointing - I was hoping for something like the ones I've tasted in NYC.  Clams are such subtle things that more needs to be used and I would not mind paying a few more dollars for that.

Our disappointment was quickly redeemed by the wonderfully refreshing and  balanced flavor of the shrimp pie.  The combination of perfectly cooked crunchy shrimp, basil, chili flakes and lemon zest set off fireworks on every part of my palate.  It's something I would definitely go back for.  

The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Bianco's.  Bianco's probably uses a starter dough that has developed that amazing flavor due to over a decade of use.  That's tough to beat.

The olive oil gelato has a nice creaminess to it but tasted more like sweet cream base with a hint of lemon than olive oil.  My only problem with it was my expectation to taste olive oil but now that I know it's more about the texture, I think I like it more."}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was AWFUL! It took TWO HOURS for our whole party to get our food, this is not an exaggeration! Get your business and service together!"}
{"text":"I am hands down obsessed with this place. Best pizza in town. Better than Grimaldi's, even! I will say that both times I have been there, my order was taken completely wrong, however, it did no phase me becasuse their pizza is worth it. The calamari is amazing as well. And the veggie salad with the white beans. I have only had these three things every time I havee been there! I just can't stray because they are so good :)"}
{"text":"Pro:  tasty pizza.  decent for kids.  riedel wine glasses.  

Con:  spotty service.   needs a good scouring.

We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.  They came out of the chutes well when they opened a couple of years ago but have become rough around the edges lately.  The staff often seems overwhelmed, there's usually a suspicious stench from the bathroom area and it feels like there's a film of \"muck\" on the tables that needs more attention.   The bacon/egg pizza is good as is the calimari.  The servers hustle and are friendly but seem overworked.  The kids+ happy hour specials are good.  The wine is good and served in real wine glasses On balance,   we're going to wait for them to right the ship before we return."}
{"text":"Cannot beat the Thursday date night deal! Fresh food options and extremely personable service (thanks, Bryce!)... We'll be regulars :)"}
{"text":"Have eaten at other Humble Pie locations in the past and have enjoyed the experience. This location was just okay. Very small, tables close together. The \"garage door\" which opens the bar to the outside was open as well as the front and side doors to the restaurant...it was FREEZING inside the restaurant. This would be awesome on a nice evening but it was just too cold the night we were there. Very uncomfortable and hard to enjoy a meal when you're shivering. Other than this, the food was good."}
{"text":"I've had great pizza at this place and enjoy the variety of options.  Quick service.  A little on the loud side with not a lot of options for private conversation.  But otherwise, overall a great experience.  Decent prices on their beverages and a good selection. Thought the portions were reasonable and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly service. Kinda small place but the patio and outside bar seating make up for it."}
{"text":"We went here after visiting Odysea. The food was good. No complaints there. Our issue occurred when we were going to pay. I was going to pay with a gift card, and I was informed they do not accept Humble Pie gift cards at this location. The entire reason we ate there was to use this gift card. 

I understand a company not honoring coupons at certain locations. What I cannot comprehend is not honoring a gift card. This was money already given to the company. Why does it matter that I use this gift card here? If you are going to have this policy, at least make it known on the menu. I feel cheated out of $50."}
{"text":"Worst management staff ever.  Simple request to change a game to a Michigan football game was met with a no and that they don't have any remotes. What a douchebag."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on our way out of town since we had time to kill. Once we got back I was looking through our account and we were charged 2x for our bill. I've left 2 messages and have not heard back from anyone. Awful customer service."}
{"text":"Stop by humble pie to kill time before our flight. Once we got back I realized they charged my card 2x. I've left 2 messages to try and resolve this and no one has even called me back! Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"First we are THRILLED to have Humble Pie on our side of town now. We'd been driving to Scottsdale once we discovered them. Lovely! Our favs are the vegetable salad with avocado, jicama, white beans, fresh mozzarella, green beans on greens and the shrimp pizza with house-made mozzarella, fresh basil, herb oil, chili flakes. And their Happy Hour is a good deal as well. Last time we tried the roasted mushroom pizza but we won't get it again. The mushrooms were microscopic and the flavor was mehh.  Their happy hour is great - the standard buy-one-get-one . Love their house made margs."}
{"text":"I was there today (Sunday). NOT GOOD. The service was so bad, really bad. We were there in the late afternoon, not a busy time at all. Our waitress forgot us...more than once. My pal had a pizza, pretty good. I have always liked their pizzas, but I wanted a hamburger which was on the menu which was not good, over cooked from the way ordered and the ratio to bread was way off. Now I realize it is a pizza place, but the hamburger is on the menu and the place promotes other foods so it should be tasty.
I will go back, for pizza, BUT the service was so bad from the waitress, who I assume will not be there. We had to ask the bartender to take care of the bill, and when we left there was only one table in the restaurant. Even the other table next we were sitting next to  was frustrated waiting for the bill. 
Food taste is subjective, but service is not and will ruin a perfectly good meal. And that is what happened."}
{"text":"My experience here is usually fantastic; the food is delicious and the staff is helpful and friendly. That remained the same today, but about thirty minutes after I left I began feeling sick. My guess is that something was wrong with the shrimp (I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp, as usual). Although it was delicious, I definitely am not a fan of being as sick as I am now."}
{"text":"Food was average. My problem was our server. This young lady had long hair which was braided, looked neat to me but guess she wasn't happy as she stood in the kitchen while she rebraided it. She then came back out to serve food wiping her nose on the back of her hand as she walked thru the dining roomio"}
{"text":"Went here today on my lunch and the service was quick and friendly.  The food was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Overall decent experience. The breakfast burrito I had \"The Spud\" was ok; very small for the price I paid. I believe it was almost 8 bucks! Flavor was bland; nothing about the food or the place made me want to be a regular here. It's not a bad place to eat, and when I return maybe I'll try the pizza some people were raving about. My only thing is, I couldn't find any pie here! Confused lol"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place for Thursday date night. The food, service and wine selection is spot on. Great place to go with a few friends too."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday night without realizing they had live music.  So loud we couldn't hear the person two feet away from us.  Asked if we could sit outside and were told no because everything was \"too wet\" from rain 5 hours earlier.  After being seated with a lovely view of the bone dry patio furniture, we ordered up and food came delivered by an angry looking woman with no smile or personality.  Pizza was small, and 1/3 of it was crust, burger was ok, toasted ravioli was unremarkable.  Everything was basically \"ehh\".  Server was friendly, food came out quick and place was clean, but for a $45 dinner, I'll go somewhere with bigger portions or better prices.  And if you plan on carrying a conversation as you eat, do not go on Monday night.


Side note - the singer was quite good, with a nice selection of songs, just way too loud for such a small place."}
{"text":"Came here because the other restaurants around had a long wait.  So- we tried this.  

The appetizer - Antipasto board sucked!Don't waste $11.95 on that.  Did I mention it SUCKED?  I've had this at other places and I was so disappointed.

The wait time was long just for the appetizer-  waiting long when I'm hungry makes me very unhappy.

My 3 stars goes to the over priced pizza.  Meat lover and artichoke was very good.  

Not coming back-  but wanted to share that the appetizer was nasty.  Good luck."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty... 4 stars but the service was pretty bad... 1 star!

We were told it was a \"slow night\" by a server but it still took 30 minutes to get our salads, and when they came out they were about half the size of the other tables who ordered the same \"date night special\".  There were some floating surprises we could not identify in my drink so had to get a new one, we had to request refills multiple times, and we ended up really being served by the other waiters since our was hardly around. 

Food IS good but not worth dealing with the service- I'll go down the street to Sauce where I've never had an issue."}
{"text":"My wife and I had always enjoyed the pies here until our last visit. What used to be a light flaky smokey crust is now is hard, dense and tasteless.  Maybe the guy who was manning the oven was recruited away to a competitor?  Whatever he reason we will not be going back to this store anytime soon. Too bad as we thought the pizza here was very close to Pizzaria Bianco."}
{"text":"I really loved my pizza. U got the SOP pizza and it was amazing. The house sangria was very good too.  My husband thought his was ok, too spicy for him. He got the buffalo chicken pizza. The kids menu is really nice too. My little ate all the spaghetti and meatball."}
{"text":"The waitress had no personality and never checked on us, and the calamari was too salty. I love a good pizza and the crust was good, but the toppings fell off when I went to pick up my slice and there was no flavor. Was disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here, literally only tried it because we bought the groupon.  Didn't even know there was a Humble Pie anywhere besides Desert Ridge.  THIS WAS OUR EXPERIENCE.

1st Our servers name was Bryce.  He was more than what you would expect for knowledgeable.  From what he told us there is some extensive training for the menu, especially the wine menu.  Bryce thank you for the lesson on Pinot Noirs from the Russian River ;)  Also he sang at the table in front of the restaurant to my sister (Isn't she lovely)  only to receive a round of applause from everyone.  That was such a cool experience.  Bryce if you read this thanks again.

2nd we had all four bruschetta not impressed with the goat cheese and peppers, just seemed bland however the other three, especially the apples and Brie were very good.

3rd Our food was Magnificent!  2 main things to talk about that were too good not to.  The Strawberry and Gorgonzola salad was excellent, it had candied pecans and the ingredients were plentiful.  Also I have to talk about the BBQ pizza, it was by far the best pizza I have ever had!  it had bacon and BBQ chicken green onions and cheese.  Wow honorable mention for the mushroom pizza BTW.

4th The wine selection was great.  It was literally only great because Bryce referred us to the perfect Pinot Noir (My favorite varietal).  The wine was perfect with our Mushroom pizza.

I really can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was told I should try the salads here... So I did.  I ordered a strawberry Gorgonzola salad.  I am so disappointed...there were MAYBE 3 strawberries, sliced, maybe a half ounce of Gorgonzola .., and a lot of lettuce.  I don't like a lot of dressing, but I think they left it off altogether... I really hate paying 8.95 for lettuce.,  service was good, food way overpriced for portions."}
{"text":"I review a lot of pizza places because pizza is my favorite food, especially wood fire pizza.  

After we went to a lovely afternoon fashion show the 6 of us decided we needed some food to dilute all the alcohol we consumed.  I drive by this place on my way home from work every day so I suggested it. 

Only one other table was occupied when we arrived, which was probably a good thing since we were a little loud.  Gary and I both had pizza, he a potato and gorgonzola (which I did not try because I think gorgonzola is terrible).  He loved it and ate every last bite. 

I had the margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella, basil and added prosciutto.  Their tomato sauce was sweet and smooth and just wonderful!  The pizza crust was charred just the right amount and had those pockets of air dough that I love tearing apart (or sticking my finger into).

Gary had a vodka martini and he said it was smooth and potent, a winning combination. 

This place will definitely be one of my revolving pizza choices."}
{"text":"Good food. Quick service. A little heavy on the vinegar on some chicken wings for my taste but not a big deal."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We have been to all of their locations in AZ and we love the chicken parm pizza. A must try!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about amazing customer experiences shall we?
The place - Humble Pie Pizza
The Reason - 6 year old Birthday Party
The Server - Mike
So we come here every year for our daughter's birthday. The food is always delicious and I decided to try the shrimp pizza this time (was also good!)
Anyway my daughter let go of her balloon. Mike stopped at nothing to get it down for her becoming our Superhero of the day!!!  The entire restaurant cheered him on. 
Thank you Mike!!!! You're the real MVP!"}
{"text":"Great experience overall. There was a delay with my pizza but I didn't care, I had 5 hours to kill before my flight - plus the manager came over and offered me a free appetizer. I like that they serve 20 oz. draft beer. Rebecca was a great server and the food was great. I ordered the amber ale (can't remember the name but it was excellent) and the mushroom pizza was phenomenal. Rebecca even provided me with some sauce to dip my crust in. 

Thanks again Rebecca! You made the experience worth it."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this establishment and had to use it. The portion sizes were so small! I ordered a bowl of turkey and steak chili which was probably one ladle full. The beans were not cooked very well. My husband's burger was ok. My boys ordered a shrimp pizza which they liked but it was very small for $13. The service was very slow and the waiter did not know how to do a Groupon transaction and that was uncomfortable because he didn't think he could use it. :( We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place and their AWESOME happy hour! It's not crazy busy like the other restaurants at Desert Ridge. My husband and I love to go here and sit at the bar and grab a good bite to eat. The guy that works behind the bar is always so attentive and friendly - just a pleasant place to go!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! Love the ambiance and pizza and salad options. Staff are really pleasant. The strawberry and gorgonzola salad has wonderful strong flavors. I had the clam pizza with roasted red peppers. It's the perfect pizza for summer. It's finished off with a fresh squeeze of lemon on top and minced parsley. I've had clam pizza before, but the combination of the red peppers really brightens up the dish and gives the perfect amount of acid and sweetness to balance the clam meat and lemon. I tried the lunch at the Thunderbird location - for $10, you can pick any of the salads from their menu and any of their pizzas (9\")! Can't beat that deal. The pizza crust is light, thin and crispy. They also gave us an honors card where you can earn points toward a free lunch deal after about 7 purchases."}
{"text":"I always love a great pizza joint, so I was excited to check this place out. My date and I started with the brussle sprouts w/ pancetta-not an original  dish and it tasted only okay. I've had better execution on that dish at other Valley restaurants. 

We had two pizzas-Artichoke and Pepperoni w/ mushrooms. They were both delicious and boasted a crispy/airy crust with lots of flavor. The crust was well seasoned (some might say a lite salty, but I loved it).  

We loved the food, but found the layout and design a little off beat.  It had a delicious foodie menu, but had  cafeteria decor..."}
{"text":"I had the fig and prosciutto pie. It was to die for! I can't wait to try the others! Yum!"}
{"text":"I went yesterday for lunch and the express lunch deal is the way to go. However I had the apple salad and they put a little too much dressing. The pizza was awesome love the prosciutto and fig pizza is super delicious!"}
{"text":"today was our second time here..the first time was great,however today was not so good....the wings were fantastic but that was about it..i had a bowl of the sausage soup which was luke warm at best,last time i had the same soup but got the cup which i actually think had the same amount for a few dollars less,the bowl portion is a ripoff...my wife ordered the littleneck clam pizza,the heavy fish smell and fishy taste made it inedible..nice place with great service,we thought it would be a new favorite for us,but we wont return..its a little spendy for what you get..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Humble Pie, with that being said it was an ok experience. Walking in I was greeted right away by what I would say would have been a server, I said that I would like to sit on the patio. I sat and saw a few of my friends there I sat at a table next to them and talked with them while waiting to get a glass of water or something to drink. I saw 2 other tables to get sat and were greeted right away by a server who got them drinks it took him 20 mins to get to me to get a water. I order the hot wing or buffalo chicken pizza what ever it was called I didn't realize it was going to have the whole top of the pizza covered in ranch. The pizza was ok and a little over priced."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I don't even think your restaurant deserves one star!! 

I have e-mailed about issues in the past like not having high chairs, being out of 5 things that were attempted to be ordered in one night from a party of four, the list goes on...since I have never heard back from corporate or this locations managers I will now voice tonight issue here. That being said this was the LAST time I will ever eat at your restaurant!!

Tonight I came in with a party of 6, we ordered drinks, appetizers, salads and pizzas. As we were towards the end of our meal we had a visitor ON OUR TABLE.....A ROACH!! We attempted to kill it but this guy was quick, the waiter came over and we told him, he grabbed a napkin off our table and killed the roach. Not once did we get an apology, a visit from a manager or even a small discount since we were all sickened by this and were not going to eat anymore of the food!

The management of this establishment is horrendous! I hope this serves as a warning for other to stay away!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service not so much. 
I sat at the bar and ordered. 
I got a great house pizza, which was delicious. Problem was, nobody ever did a callback. 
I ate my entire meal before one of the bartenders asked if I wanted another drink. 
The airport location is outrageously expensive. 
The specialty pizzas run about $16 and the house wine is Tisdale. Tisdale is the worst crap out there and you can buy it in many stores for less than five dollars a bottle. 
They charge $9.80 a glass for it. Be prepared!"}
{"text":"What can I say... I love food, I love pizza and I love Humble Pie's Thursday date night special!  Date night special includes, one appetizer, two salads and one pizza for $25 (last time I was there) Plenty of yummy food for two!! Of course adding an glass of wine or beer increases the price a bit, still the overall price for the amount of food and great service is a great date night!"}
{"text":"Definitely met expectations. We had been wanting to try this place for weeks as a location opened up just blocks from our house, glad we finally got around to it. We sat on the patio because the dining room was cold and crowded especially for a Wednesday night in a suburban area. there was a barrier between the tables and the parking lot so it kept most of the headlights and noise out.
 Appetizer was the caprese burrata which was a mild let down because they give you a very small amount of burrata and it's already out of the shell, not like the photo at all. Still tasty though. Pizzas were fig & prosciutto and BBQ chicken. Fig & prosciutto definitely won that contest. Our waitress was a little sullen and dressed very casually in shorts that were more than a little short and tight , we noticed this about the staff , they were all dressed in street clothes. You couldn't tell who was a staff member and who was a guest. we found this odd mostly because the women either had bra straps hanging out, jeans that were torn and dirty, or shorts that were far too short or tight. Caused most patrons to stare and make comments as they walked by. Maybe this should be addressed? It definitely takes away from the ambiance.

Food was good enough to bring us back again. We will try happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Mr. B and I decided for pie this evening. We arrived at a good time (Happy Hour; best time of the day). We immediately sat down at the bar and began to peruse the menu. There were 10 patrons throughout the entire establishment (including the tables outside). That in mind, I'm curious why the service was so mediocre (3 stars).

We started out with an order of french fries (parsley, garlic, lemon zest, pecorino cheese, chili flakes with garlic aioli). There was another couple at the bar having the same and they LOOKED delicious. For an entree we decided to share a Humble Pie Signature Sausage Pizza (roasted fennel, house-made mozzarella, tomato sauce). Mr. B has a thing for everything sausage. All of that was washed down with a few glasses of Pinot Noir.

Though the fries were visually tasty looking in front of others, I have to say I was rather disappointed when I received our order. Its apparent that they're frozen pre-cut fries however, they shouldn't taste as such. The wet ingredients overpowered the fries making them horribly soggy and extremely cold. If I were to rate the fries on their own merit, they'd be worthy of a whooping 3 stars.

The Signature Sausage gets a good 5 stars (we've been back several times and Mr. B gets the SAME thing every time). The combo of the ingredients is perfect! Something about that fennel. If you are really hungry, grab a pie for self. Should you adore your company (as much as I do mine), I'd suggest sharing a pie and perhaps a salad to bring your meal full circle (you won't be overstuffed). Definitely a pie you should consider.

I am quite disappointed with the level of service that we received, or lack thereof. For there to only be a few people in the restaurant, I found it unacceptable that servers were not attending their respective areas as they should. Our bartender spent more time away from his area than he did behind the bar (there were only 4 of us at the bar). The disappointment that night has not stopped me from returning (I LOVE A GOOD PIE) however, I am cautious as to whether we dine in or take-out."}
{"text":"I finally got a second chase to go to humble pie this weekened and nothing but great things to say !! I got the shrimp pizza and it was to die for ! I can't wait to go back to get this dish . The staff was friendly and the service was great . Little to no waitting!My husband is very inpatient and he was very pleased with how fast we received our food !! We will be spending another one of our date nights here !!"}
{"text":"great pizza cooked in a fire wood burning stove.....very comfortable wine bar; with outdoor patio.....love this place"}
{"text":"This was a good pizza! We were looking for a simple place to eat while we were visiting our son in Scottsdale and we happened upon this pizza place. The service was good and the pizza was good and the price was okay.In addition to the pizza, we had an antipastos plate which was very good or we could have been very hungry. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We are regulars and love the food and friendly staff. The pizza is original and delicious."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced for what you get. Service was fine, but the pizza is worth $10, and you pay $21 for a pepperoni with a fountain drink. Would not go back unless either the quality goes up, or price comes down. Expected better from one of Sky Harbor's higher quality joints that have a restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and wanted to check it out. Walked in and was told to take a seat anywhere. Was kinda limited on where to sit since a bunch of tables were not cleaned and had dishes still sitting on the tables from previous patrons. So we sat down at a clean table and waited to be greeted....and waited...finally about 10 minutes or so someone finally came by to take our drink order. It was definitely not busy. So we got a couple beers-some good beers on tap. Got the bruschetta and was very disappointed. I think I could make it better at my own home, but I knew they were known for there pizza so I went onto the next. Got a basic margarita pizza and it was good. Liked that the best of my visit there. I am a lover of ranch and they had the best ranch I've ever had. Over all I was not super impressed by my Humble Pie experience and will try other places instead of this. Maybe come back in a few months to try again."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is a \"go to\" favorite for us!  We can always count on great service and the staff is so friendly!!! The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is very pleasant..  Always a great experience!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Humble Pie and we were not impressed. We started off with the caprese salad and chicken drumettes. The caprese salad is deconstructed and nothing to rave about. The chicken drumettes were completely flavorless. We literally doused them in ranch to get some flavor out of them. Next, we had a Cesar salad. Super simple, definitely not worth the $12 and again, had to add lemon juice, salt and pepper in order for it to be palatable. Lastly, we ordered the S.O.P pizza but our waitress accidentally put in the order for a pepperoni pizza. She asked if we still wanted the original pizza we ordered and we said yes because the pepperoni pizza did not look appetizing at all! The pepperoni was stacked one on top of the other, they didn't even take the time to spread them out evenly. Once we got our pizza, it was clear that it would be a disappointment like the rest of our food. You literally can't pick up a slice without having all of the cheese and toppings slide off and it appeared to be undercooked. There are several similar pizza joints in the valley, this one is definitely bottom of the barrel."}
{"text":"I used to love Humble Pie.  I work close to the area, so my colleagues and I would go over there for lunch.  Recently this place has become busier, so they raised their prices and the quality of the food has decreased tremendously. I order the strawberry and walnut salad, and I'm pretty sure I found one single slice of strawberry in the whole thing and it was soggy and tasted like it came from the frozen food section.  Unfortunately I'm over this place.  Too bad they couldn't get popular, and retain their original quality."}
{"text":"A couple of friends were raving about Humble Pie so I thought I should check it out. Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed. The service was very poor. The waitress rarely interacted with us and so didn't spend much time explaining the menu when we had questions. I decided to try a different pizza since this is what they are known for. I ordered the egg pizza which sounded great until I took the first bit. There was barely any flavor and no sauce. I was eating a breadstick with egg, prosciutto and cheese. I won't write them off completely but it's going to take quite the amazing pizza and service to win my vote back."}
{"text":"As a downtowner, there are far too many amazing pizza joints to choose from for me to even consider wasting my money at Humble Pie ever again. The food is OK, but your time is much better spent at Cibo, Bianco, Z Pizza, or even Pinot's! 

AMBIANCE: 

First off, the ambiance is seriously lacking. Small, boring space with bad lighting and poor music selection. Also, nasty smelling bathrooms. Thanks, but no thanks. 

DRINKS: 

Secondly, they serve up a HORRIBLE $9 lukewarm cocktail that tastes like pickle juice and vodka, masquerading as a cucumber gin libation. BEYOND disgusting. Shocked at first sip, I was too turned off to try any of their other specialty cocktails. Thankfully, they let me swap this disaster of a drink out for a nice glass of chardonnay. 

FOOD: 

As for appetizers, they were out of the teppanyaki green beans we wanted to try. The Calabrese salad was decent, but nothing to write home about, certainly not capable of rivaling the likes of what they serve up at Postino's. The steak turkey chili was underwhelming... in fact, the only decent option worth mentioning are the garlic fries.

Pizzas were acceptable, but they won't split your order. My husband and I wanted to order half a Schriner's Sausage and half Pear Gorgonzola, no such luck. This place is one of the ONLY pizza joints I've visited in town that won't accommodate a half and half order. Super disappointing.

OVERALL: 

The icing on this giant lackluster cake was their refusal to honor the coupons we brought in. We came in for dinner with some neighbors of ours, all of us lured by the prospect of spending $20 and receiving a free pizza. Unfortunately, after telling the waiter about our coupons from the beginning, and ordering WELL over $20 per couple, we were told at the very end that only one of our coupons would be honored. 

Needless to say, we were all extremely let down by this entire experience, and will definitely NOT be back. Ridiculous waste of $50 (coupon and all)!"}
{"text":"VERY disappointed. No ambiance. Ugly patio. Rude staff. The website menu shows a gluten free option but when I asked about it they seemed irritated. Food isn't great. Wine pours are small. This neighborhood needed a new restaurant/bar but this one isn't going to cut it."}
{"text":"I expect overpriced food in the airport, but I at least get a meal from most places. I won't be coming back to Humble Pie. I paid $13.99 for a handful of lettuce, three or four strawberries, and maybe 6 oz of chicken. And a dressing cup. What a joke. And it took 15 minutes to be made."}
{"text":"I was sitting at my desk at work, and right about 5pm I began to crave pizza. So on my way home, I decided that instead of opting for delivery, that I would treat myself to some delicious gourmet pizza. Alas, I came across humble pie....

Upon walking in I was greeted by two friend hostesses, who informed me that they are owned by the same person as 5th and Wine. My pulse immediately quickened based on past experience, but I decided to stay and give it a whirl. I am SO glad I did!

The place is pretty cozy and the pizza ovens are open to the restaurant. Since it was just me, I decided to sit up at the bar by the pizza ovens where you can watch the chefs make the pizza. 

I ordered the assorted olives to get things started, which are really tasty, and then I ordered a goat cheese pizza. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh, and the crust was perfect! I didn't feel like I was too full from the crust, and it showcased the main ingredients very well. Overall it was a great pick. I fully intend on enjoying some wine as well as a few of their other menu options next time I stop in."}
{"text":"Hearing from a couple across the street that this was a good place to eat my wife and I decided to give it a shot. Hostess promptly greeted us and asked if we wanted high or low seating. My wife wanted high and we sat and both immediately realized that these were very uncomfortable and asked to be moved to lower seats. This was not a problem as there were open seats. I guess I'm spoiled by booth seating as I was uncomfortable in those seats as well. The waiter came and took drink orders as we looked over the menu. My wife loves pizza so that's what she ordered and I though the basil tomato cheese whatever sounded good so that's what we ordered. Our drinks came, a margarita and a coke with the margarita being blue in color but very tasty. After about 10 minutes the waiter showed up with the pizza for my wife and said my order would be a minute longer. After a few minutes I inquired about the salad that came with my sandwich and was told it wasn't separate. No problem there but having to wait a least 12 to 15 minutes longer to receive my sandwich was pressing it. If fact with as few of customers there you would have thought the chefs? that didn't appear to have much to do could have pulled off a simultaneous delivery of our orders but alas that wasn't to be. Now my wife loves pizza and I can take it or leave it depending on the quality. I had tasted my wife's during the wait for my order and knew right away this place has issues. My sandwich and salad came and I hopefully jumped in the salad which had the house creamy vinaigrette which I took one bite of and set the fork down. Now I can't really say weather this sandwich was what it was supposed to be or not. All I can say is that I didn't care for it as the basil was overwhelming and there just wasn't much there aside from the cheese a little bit of tomato and what ever that horrible basil sauce was. We had to ask for the check with my wife asking for a box. Now the check was $37 something and to be honest if the food would have been as good as the margarita I wouldn't have minded. But it wasn't and I very seriously doubt that I will ever be back."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and the food is always good. Love the Italian sausage pizza and the one with the pears. Kids eat free Sundays are awesome!! there can be a wait when it's busy during fri/sat rush but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is great! I found out about them in the AZ Republic and decided to give it a try.

Our server was very attentive and the food was awesome. I had the fresh chopped salad (tomatoes, mozzarella, turkey salami and a great vinaigrette) and LOVED IT... doesn't hurt that the mozzarella is made in house. I've never had mozzarella that fresh!!

Can't beat this place,  my new favorite spot in the west valley!"}
{"text":"This place has it all!  We came on a Thursday night, August 13, 2015.  We ordered the date night deal. It was great since we got our own salads and an app and a pizza. All the food was exceptional but the fried ravioli was my favorite. They also had a live musician that night and she was fantastic.  We planned on leaving much earlier but we ended up staying the entire time. The vibe of the restaurant was a fun place to enjoy wine for the night."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this location today for lunch. From the time my husband and I walked in everything was perfect. Our server today was Kaitlen and she was beyond attentive. She answered all of our questions with ease and made us feel very welcome. Our drinks never went empty and we were promptly provided with everything that we needed. 

The lunch special was perfect! We were able to try multiple things on the menu while keeping the portions smaller but it was enough to fill you up and then some! The shrimp pizza, as well as the strawberry and gorgonzola salad, was amazing!

We will definitely be returning soon... They offer a great happy hour and daily specials that make this experience well worth your hard earned dollar!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. This was our second choice for pizza, the first place place was out of dough. Very unorganized staff. I wish I would have took a picture of the pizza, how could they serve something that looked that disgusting. The service was horrible. Wait, wait and wait. They advertised free kids meal and fee Mother's Day pizza, not true. I didn't know they had the offer, we were just there too eat, except the waitress mentioned it. Thanks for a horrible Mother's Day dinner."}
{"text":"Had a previous experience that wasn't good but didn't get a chance to have the pie, so I didn't review. The latest experience was okay too but the pies were not good.

Service on the phone for the takeout order was solid. We arrived about 10 minutes late to pick up . It was to be ready in 15-20. We arrived in 30. Though the service was good and prompt, the order wasn't ready and the crew seemed to be hustling pies out of the oven. It was only another 5 minutes or so. No biggie.

The veggie salad was very good; however, when we opened the pie boxes, we thought the Margherita was pretty sad. Sure there are all kinds of variations on this fare that has evolved from peasant food, but we took a pic so you can judge for yourself. It tasted rather \"okay.\" The roasted mushroom pie tasted really salty to me, which might have been because it was a bit overloaded with pancetta... probably cheap pancetta. That might have been nice for many folks to get extra swine, but we wanted a mushroom-based pie, not a pancetta pizza."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on Friday night at about 9:15.  Humble Pie closes at 10, so I can understand a bit of briskness in service.  No biggie.  We were seated, decided on the caprese appetizer and the pistachio pizza.  When our appetizer came, it was a wide soup bowl with about an inch of olive oil in the bottom, a glob of mozzarella, about a half cup of basil pesto, 4 cherry tomatoes and a few slices of bread.  The mozzarella was so tough, we had to use a knife to cut it.  Trying to skewer little, round tomatoes one they've been rolling around in a bath of oil proved to be one of the least glamorous things I've done in a long time.  After wrestling with the appetizer for about 3 minutes, our pizza was brought to us, and it was COVERED in rosemary.  Now, I like spices as much as the next girl, but there was enough on the pizza to actually change the texture.  After eating half of each dish between the two of us, we decided to leave, sans take-out boxes.  My vote is leave the pizza to places like Cibo, P. Bianco and others who have proved themselves.  And as a side-note, please update the music selection for the folks who do dine there.  Bad 90's pop sprinkled with radio commercials isn't a help to the experience."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised ... good pizza in an airport!

I ordered using the self-serve kiosk, and had a super hot margherita pizza in my hands in less than 5 minutes.  It isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but usual to find this quality and speed in an airport.  Staff was very friendly to boot.  Pricey @ $11, but I'm on business travel...."}
{"text":"Brick oven pizza with real uncured pepperoni and legitimate mozzarella toppings. I don't eat pizza with tomato sauce but I would assume they are not using an additive heavy sauce like most chains do."}
{"text":"The true measure of a place is how they fix a screw-up. For their response, I give the Scottsdale branch four stars. 

As a pizza lover and a Desert Ridge dweller, I frequent that location... well, frequently. Everything's consistently awesome, and I love their crust. I should copy and paste a few of these sentences over there to give them some good stars, but whatever. This review is about the Scottsdale location.

Due to the restaurants not being where my friends live, not many of them have tried HP. I feel it's my duty to get some of the goat cheese pizzas into their bellies. So when en route to some pre-game drinking for a fancy holiday party that would leave my friends and me drunk (therefore needing alcohol-padding), I suggested we pick up some to-go pizza at this location. 

The online ordering was simple, and my three pizzas and giant salad were ready when I got there. I didn't think to check my pizzas at this time, and they were unfortunately overdone. (Hey, it happens. *Kanye shrug*) 

When we called to see about fixing the order, the guy who answered the phone was easy to work with. Ultimately, my money was refunded for the entire order -- not just got the ultra-cripsy pizzas. The gesture was much-appreciated. 

Many thanks, Humble Pie in Scottsdale. I will be back when I'm again in the area."}
{"text":"Love it.  we had salad pizza and bottle of wine.  Excellent service.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this place so we thought we would try it. We were very disappointed and won't be back again. We ordered the strawberry Gorgonzola salad and the BBQ chicken pizza. The salad was ok but had hardly any dressing so we had to ask the waiter for more. The strawberries were slightly mushy so I'm guessing they were previously frozen and were not fresh. The BBQ chicken pizza was a huge disappointment. The pizza was super spicy and was not your typical BBQ pizza with a sweet BBQ sauce. I wish the waiter had told us it was going to be spicy because we would have ordered something else. The service was ok but overall we were disappointed by our experience."}
{"text":"After finding the wait time at another local joint was going to be 1.5 hours we decided to try something new. A couple friends and I all tried Humble Pie for the first time and were very pleased. The service was friendly and the food was yummy and came out super fast. Our server(kyle) was very personable and made our experience a delight. We will be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Oh goodness....SOOOOO GOOD! They have great specials too. Highly recommend for a different type of pizza place. Steve was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Unlike others the service was quick, and very pleasant. We started with fried cheese and a soft pretzel. The cheese was NOT the frozen nuggets but home made and awesome. Pretzel with Bri dip was a hit too. They also have a horseradish mustard that was great. Ordered the roasted mushroom pizza with white sauce. Fantastic with a crispy center and an airy crust."}
{"text":"There people are lairs. Say it's going to be ready in 4. But in actually in 10. When u have to get on a flight, that time matters."}
{"text":"Thursday night Date Night is a great special.   This is great food at an easy price.  Staff and atmosphere are comfortable.  Love the Pizza and Anti- Pasta board."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Three of us went, had three different pizzas and they all looked fantastic.  I had a Gorgonzola, arugula, and pear pizza.  Nothing was too overwhelming, and it was really perfect.  Each pizza was a perfect size for dinner and even some for the next day for lunch.  The drinks were great (the Humble Pie Cosmo has white cranberry juice, gotta love it)...the four stars is because I can't STAND TVs in restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had some really good food today..... but more than that/ the hostess had a great attitude while we waited for our table. Glad we waited..... we would have missed the friendly service from Katlin. Try the spicy Parmesan fries..... and the sour dough cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is right down the street from our house, so it's become our neighborhood pizza joint. The first time we ate there, we went to the Scottsdale location. That was probably our best experience. We had the SOP pizza (tasty) and the Shrimp pizza (just ok). We have been to the 7th Street location several times and also ordered to-go a couple times. Last night we ordered the wings, wedge salad and prosciutto and pear pizza to-go. The wings did not have enough sauce and were dry. The prosciutto on the pizza was super thick, not quite what I was expecting.  The wedge was good, and consistent with all the other times I'd ordered it. I think Humble Pie is really best for eating in the restaurant. By the time you get it home, everything is cold and the wings didn't seem to be the same as when we eat them at the restaurant.Not really worth the $35 for a small pizza and a few small items. I will say  I've had the goat cheese pizza on several occasions and it has been good every time. The service is always good at Humble Pie and the atmosphere is casual yet trendy. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We like this place a lot.  It is close by, so it is convenient for us.  The atmosphere is casual.  Depending upon where you get seated, it could be a little too close for comfort sitting next to others.  If you get seated at an elevated table, that is best.  The chopped salad is a MUST have!  Theirs is the best I've had and I've had quite a few.  They make their own mozzarella cheese and it is excellent.  Their wood fired pizzas are really good, but $13 for the size served it a little too much $$...... they need to get it down to about $10 or else increase the size of the pizza.  It's a good place to view sports events on the TVs they have and their indoor/outdoor bar set-up is quite nice.  Take out is a good choice.  Expect to pay about $20/ person for your meal."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night and took advantage of their 1/2 off bottles of wine night. Our party ordered a pepperoni pizza (all of the pizzas are 12\"), an order of lasagna and a strawberry & Gorgonzola salad, all of which were very good. 
They have a nice patio, but it was too hot to sit outside this time. They had live music which was great, and unexpected on a Monday night. It was a little loud, however. More of a bar atmosphere than I expected at 6 pm. 
 They have different specials throughout the week and daily happy hour with food and drink specials."}
{"text":"Manger was rude and had first refused to remake my order. I had place an order for the first time 3weeks ago, they messed up my pizza I believe I received somebody's else's pizza. I had originally ordered a margarita pizza and a pepperoni with 2 salads. When I got my order I had called right away and expressed my concerns letting them know my pizza was wrong, cold and missing cheese. They said they will remake it next time and had involved a manager and they took my name down. To my surprise today I called today to place my order and to go pick it up myself. I spoke to the manager I believe her name was Jennifer she was rude and said they never had a record of what had happend even though I gave her name and time and day of when I had originally placed my order she didn't want to replace my order we were going back and forth for 10 mins and I told her this is my first time you guys promised to fix it and instead I'm getting the runaround. Finally she agreed to replace it after how upset I was. I got there assuming I was getting what I paid for 2 pizzas and 2 salads and she told me sorry you didn't ask for the salads it's common sence i kept saying I paid a high end price to get what I pay for instead the whole experience was terrible. I will not use humble pie or refer them to my business associates. All I asked was my order to be fixed and for me to pick it up it was very simple task and could avoid losing a customer."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a fabulous experience today!  Our flight was delayed but Stacey, who moved a mile a minute, made the time totally worth it. Great cocktails and service, her attention to detail even when stressed was incredible. Did her customers know she filled their martini glasses with ice and then water to chill them? Wow!  So impressed. Thank you for a wonderful airport bar adventure. We loved everything and were amazed by your excellent customer service. I know there were many others behind the scene. Thank you all as well!"}
{"text":"We just got home from taking my husband for a late Father's Day lunch at Humble Pie.   It's located in the same building as the unsuccessful \"Living Room\"  which has an awesome interior.   The joint was hoppin' but they managed to squeeze our family of three into a spot.  The service was great and we were in luck because the specials and happy hour prices were in place.    We decided to go for \"pie\" and each of us ordered a pizza all were quite good and our favorite was the Meatball Pie.  We would like to go back to try out something other than \"pie\" -- which I think I prefer Cibos instead.  This is definitely a family-friendly establishment that doesn't frown upon small well-behaved kids, but it still has the nice cool downtown vibe."}
{"text":"Over priced pizza, trying to be fancy for food i have had much better other places. Went for sons school fund raiser and wont go back."}
{"text":"Our pizza was burnt and service was so slow. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Innovative menu...check.
Great and friendly service....check.
Best Shrimp Pizza I've ever had ...check.

RUN here. This is what American gourmet pizza SHOULD be!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving a two (which is generous) is because the pizza was delicious and they have Hop Knot. 

The service was fine, nothing fantastic but not horrible. My boyfriend and I went for the date night dinner because it seemed like a good deal. The caprese was okay, not traditional style but it was still tasty. I ordered the Strawberry salad and he had the chopped, both of which were horrible...and we are the two least picky eaters you will ever meet. I could barely even pick at the salad which was really disappointing. 
As I stated previously, the pizza was delicious. The issue I had was the other individuals at the bar. The restaurant was basically empty. There were two extremely drunk woman at the bar creating a huge show. At one point one woman lifted up her shirt and showed her bra to the bartender. Although it made for good conversation, it was embarrassing, hard to watch, and the last thing I want to see when I want to have a nice relaxing dinner out. 

No one asked them to leave or seemed to stop serving or even offered to call them a cab. Because there were so few individuals even eating in the restaurant I was surprised they didn't discount everyone's bill for having to see that. I could only imagine what would have happened if there were families present (this was around about 8 at night)

Great pizza, okay beer selection, but that's about all. I was really disappointed in my time there and I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Just ordered food from Humble Pie using a delivery service.  The food looked and tasted as if it had been left over and microwaved.  The portions were very small and the prices were very expensive for the quality and portion.  What a let down."}
{"text":"Our overall experience at Humble Pie was just okay. The restaurant had great ambiance but the service and food were nothing to write home about. We ordered the signature cucumber infused cocktail and it was horrible. We sent them back and ordered a beer and a glass of wine. The wine was hot and the beer.. well how can you screw up a bottle of beer. We ordered a pizza and some pasta it was just okay. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta it's my fave. Everything is good here have never been disappointed. And the service is always friendly and good."}
{"text":"I've had a good experience here, but my recent visit will be my last. We wanted a wood fired pizza so went to the Humble Pie across from Desert Ridge. Our waiter was nice, but clearly not detail oriented. Forgot our salad, didn't instruct the kitchen to cook my order the way I requested, and generally didn't take care of the basic service expectation. The pepperoni sausage pizza was just OK, soggy and too thin in the center, but the crust was delicious. Wings, which were described as Buffalo wings by our waiter, were definitely not Buffalo wings; even my home recipe is better.  Overall I think we had an unskilled waiter who was poorly trained. Suggestion: if you dine here and order pizza, ask for the pizza to be cooked well done."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, decent prices.  Stopped in for a burger with a groupon on vacation - what a great spot!  Good food, friendly service, and a full bar."}
{"text":"The breakfast sounds like it would be great but they dont open until 6am. Not really convenient for anyone with an early flight. If your going to offer food inside the terminals past security you should be available whenever flighhs are scheduled.   Will think about that the next time i am looking to get a bite to eat"}
{"text":"Best little spot on the west side.  Go sit at the bar and have Kaitlen take care of you.  Food is great, happy hour is available on Saturday -- which makes for a nice afternoon spot.  Shrimp on the salad was fantastic and perfect with the wine -- thanks Kaitlen.  

Proud of the fact that the humble pie in our neighborhood is the best one we've been to."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place.  Way friendly staff, good pizza, great happy hour, and the bar is a total friendly neighborhood hang out.

If you are not up for pizza, try the tuna melt, or the lasagna.

Cheers,
D"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had here in AZ.  It was delicious. . Service.was.prompt.and fast...waiter was fab.  Must go check this out...plus salad are yummy too"}
{"text":"I have gone to Humble Pie a handful of times over the last few years.  Overall their food is very good.  However, almost every time we go, their service is very slow or there are issues with the service.  The last time I was there we had had to wait forever to receive our food.  This time, knowing it takes a while, we ordered right away...but that didn't work.  Not only did it take a long time to receive our food, my wife's pizza never showed up.  When asked where it was, we were told that another waiter grabbed it.  So we had to wait for a new pizza while the others got their food.  It's too bad, their pizzas are very good, but I hesitate to go back since it seems like their slow service is an ongoing issue."}
{"text":"This was my first time at humble pie and I love the  ambience. Our server was outstanding and had wonderful recommendations. I had the artichoke pizza which had green olives on it.... normally I find green olives way to salty but it was perfect on this pizza. I highly recommend the strawberry Gorgonzola salad as well :)"}
{"text":"Great beer.
Great pizza.
Always great service.
A must go in the PHX."}
{"text":"$11 for a wrap. It's tiny. The contents are very moist. It's supposed to be eggs. I think it's feggs, you know,  fake eggs. Spicy bloody mary was lame. I think I got around ten smaller-than-dice sized potatoes that were cold and tasteless. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gross! We're never coming back. I had the chicken pesto pizza. It was okay, meaning I was able to eat a few slices. My husband had the potato garlic pizza and it was disgusting. Soggy, chewy, and very ill-conceived. He could only eat a slice."}
{"text":"Well, my long overdue update to my Humble Review has arrived.  I must say that I was much more pleased in all ways with my return visit.  The food was better, the service pleasant and all in all I think I will be returning again."}
{"text":"Bryce is a fabulous server. The shrimp pizza is excellent, along with great salads. A great foodie find in Peoria!"}
{"text":"The worst breakfast wrap I've ever eaten. The tortilla was rubbery, the eggs looked fake and the sausage was bland. I can't believe I spent $11 on that sorry excuse for breakfast. Do not order the breakfast wrap unless you want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ya gotta go here.

I've driven past this place a million times and as a sucker for strung, patio lights I had to check it out. Went on a Thursday to take advantage of the Date Night Special which is one app, 2 salads and a pizza to share. Really good deal for $20. 
I got there about 8 minutes before HH was over and took advantage of that too. 
We order the toasted ravilois (rocatta cheese is the best), 1 chobbed salad and 1 apple and a rugloa salad. He got the chobbed and it looked better than mine, but to each their own.
Rizzo (hands the best waiter there) recced the Scheiners pizza and it was fantastic. 6 hearty slices was more than enough after the 2 small meals that came before it.
Drinks are best on HH but moderately priced afterwards. THe atmosphere is fantastic. Outdoor seating are large park picnic tables. Not the most comfy things to sit on and they're a bit far between bench and table top but it was worth it. The canopy lights and great smells and sounds coming from the main dining had a great ambiance. 

I'd totally go back here. Would like to try the fried green beans from the app menu and the grilled chicken pesto pizza. On online and check out their daily specials in addition to HH each day. Super place."}
{"text":"Good place for some pizza. I personally prefer wood fired pizza and this place has some good pizza. I personally love the chicken parmesan pizza. Their wine selection is pretty good too. Not huge but a nice little selection. They do have a date night special on Thursday I believe too so we try to take advantage of that when we can. I wish they still had the meat and cheese appetizer tray though. Otherwise love this place."}
{"text":"As always, great service and great food! The bartender Kaitlen was amazing. Everyone else was really friendly. All around it was a good experience. Good food. Good drinks. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This will do just fine for airport food. Fig and prosciutto pizza was sweet, savory, and delicious with the caramelized-to-a-jam onions and salty goat cheese. You can grab one in 15 minutes if you've got a plane to catch. 

The beer selection included Goose IPA (local?) on tap, and that's just fine to make the flight more bearable. Spirits are advertized, but there's nothing interesting there."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Humble Pie!  Good wine list and an awesome selection of interesting pizzas! Great service and we've never had to wait!  My favorite, the gorgonzola and potato pizza!  If you want a traditional pepperoni pie, this probably isn't the place to go.  But, if you want creative pizza options and great wine, you'll love it.  Oh, they have a great selection of draft beers as well!"}
{"text":"Food is greater than Service.
Came here a few times-- once as a couple, once with three others and a third time with a party of 7. Each time, loved the food. The service was average or even less than. The staff didn't have very good personalities and on one occasion, a manager came over and had apologized for the wait time and the fact that the waitress had been short/rude. He tried to make a joke about how she was helping out from the Scottsdale location (which we have been to and enjoyed before) and how she wasn't exactly a 7th st location fit just yet..
It seemed out of place for him to comment, but he was light hearted and it didn't disturb us. We have always had great food from here.. and I would recommend their salad and the goat cheese pizza. YUM"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this pizza crust!  Its thick without being too \"doughy\" and just crispy enough to give a nice crunch.  Went with three friends and we started with a bruchetta appetizer that was delicious and then we each ordered a different pizza.  These pies are 12\" around and they only make the one size...easily enough to share if you want.  One friend got the gluten free crust (an additional $3) and he really liked it.  I ordered the BLT pizza which is exactly like it sounds....a BLT sandwich on pizza crust and it was very good...topped full of lettuce, cherry tomatoes, bacon and mayonnaise (yum!)  

Our waiter was adorable and very attentive.  I was the only one hungry enough to finish my pizza and the others took about half of theirs home.  The vibe is comfortable as a place on lower 7th St. should be.  Its more like being down on Mill Avenue than being in Scottsdale or uptown Phx (not that there is anything wrong with either of those places).  We were all too full to order dessert but next time I want that pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! I have been an extremely loyal customer of Humble Pie especially the Desert Ridge location. I was a die hard fan of the chop salad, so so addicting!!! I could eat it everyday, well not so much anymore! It has changed drastically; twice now I have gotten it for pick up and when I get home it's so gross I throw it away. The turkey is said to be roasted in house, which used to be awesome... Now only seems like slimy deli meat... They throw in yellow and brown lettuce.... Used to be so full of all the ingredients but now totally skimpy... Hardly any salami or turkey... I am not one to complain, I worked in the industry for 10 years but it's so upsetting and gross I had to put something! In hopes maybe they will change it back! Please fix these problems, the salad used to be so amazing!!!!!

Now I'm going to have to try another location to see if they have it like before, now I'm craving it and need to satisfy that!!! Hope they all haven't made these changes.."}
{"text":"Pizza is their specialty and it shows. Plenty of imaginative combinations (potato & leek, or maybe an over-easy egg?) and quality ingredients. The atmosphere is nice, if not a bit cramped. Salads are good too."}
{"text":"If you really, really, really like basil, you might like Humble Pie.  I; however, only slightly fancy basil and found myself scrapping a good deal of it off my pizza.

The pizza at Humble Pie is okay, but not worth the 35 minute wait to be seated.  The crust was delicious, but the actual dough, was too thin.  The my toppings and sauce wouldn't stay on top of the dough.  The basil would, but not the rest of the toppings.  Did I mention they like to employ basil.

What saved my dining experience was the excellent wait staff and the desert.  I tried the apple cobbler and it was yummy."}
{"text":"Went there once last week and got a pie and a Caesar salad. The salad had a ton of celery in it. Never had Caesar with celery and it totally ruined the flavor. The pie was average at best. 

Placed a to go order today to try something different. Ordered the mac and cheese. Got back to the office and had a bowl with about 15-20 penne noodles and a runny Bechamel sauce with NO cheese! It was disgusting. No flavor at all. I would have taken it back if I didn't have to get on a conference call. I sent them a message. 

It's right next door to my office and super convenient, but not sure I'll give them a 3rd try."}
{"text":"Great locally owned place too eat. They have wonderful daily specials. If you have little ones, stop by on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Every bit as good as the overhyped Pizzaria Bianco,and no 3 hour wait. 
Had a very good mushroom and pancetta pizza and a strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Both were top notch. Wine list is reasonably priced, good selection. Friendly staff. Anyone picking on their decor is really a bit off, nothing wrong with a simple decor. Warm, inviting. Nice bar that opens to the patio. 
Really all in all a very good experience. Good food, good wine, happy staff, reasonably priced. And I would have to say underated, so even though I think they are a very solid 4 star restaurant, I am giving them 5 stars to help get there ratings up. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered from here this weekend the first and last time.  Food is overpriced,  arrives cold and simply boring. Delivery driver gave us a bunch of attitude and when we called the restaurant the manager acted like it was an inconvenience to speak with us.  What a disappointment and waste of time."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite neighborhood hangs!! We enjoy sitting at the bar and get excellent service from Caitlyn (gosh, I hope I'm spelling her name right). It's great atmosphere, the food is quite good -- I LOVE their BLT sandwich -- and prices are reasonable. Soups are also worth trying, and you can't go wrong with the pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during happy hour.  Place was quiet but a dog was on the patio which I liked, so if you have a dog- bring them along.  We ordered the sausage pizza, chili, chicken drumlets (aka wings), and a salad (for me).  The salad was AMAZING!!! It was so fresh and had yummy cuts of fresh mozzarella and green beans, etc. it was just so damn good.  The pizza was great and the chili made me think of thanksgiving it was just so hearty.  Wings were wings nothing amazing.  It was just a beautiful AZ afternoon on the patio with a great lunch."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza.  We always order the caesar salad, roasted mushroom and the sausage pizza.  Eating here is better since the food is served hot.  We ordered take out the other day, and it was just ok.  I think it was because the pizza is so thin, that by the time we got home, it was lukewarm.  It was still very tasty, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"We were one of 4 tables in the restaurant at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night.  We ordered calamari which was delicious.  The pizza literally fell apart as we picked it up.  We had to eat the toppings and crust  separately. The crust was soggy. Service was very slow considering how slow the restaurant was.  We won't be back :("}
{"text":"It wasn't bad for what it is: pizza. Even bad pizza is pretty good.

That being said, it wasn't great. The pizza wasn't super good, and with a $75 bill for two pies, two salads, and two glasses of wine, I expect a lot more.

Its a nice sit down spot, and I love the location, but a few notes:

- Service isn't good.
We ordered two salads, two pies. Pies came out before the salads did, so our pizzas sat there and got cold while we finished our salads. I am a big fan of things being timed and plated properly. Especially when I am paying what we did for dinner.

Also, hand your customers the proper pizza box for their left-overs, not a styrofoam container. Its a classy move to give the cardboard box, and since you're trying to be a classy place, go with the solid.

- Too much salt.
They use A LOT of salt in the dough and in the toppings. So much so that my girlfriend was having a hard time later in the night with all the sodium intake. If your food is good, you don't need that much salt to make it great. Take it down 80%.

- Work on your wine list
For what you have, its over priced. Get something different in there, stop with the stock bottles from everywhere else in Phoenix.

- Damn its loud.
The acoustics in there are unrelenting. If you plan on having a conversation with your date or fellow diners, try somewhere else.

----
 
Long story short, you're not Pizzeria Bianco. Stop trying to pretend to be. Go a different direction and get better at that."}
{"text":"Honestly was Horrendous. 
I first walked in and it had an awful scent of Sulfur. We ordered a Pizza and Salad and the Employee gave us our bill. We had a group-on, and he needed to change the Price because of Tuesday \"deals\", and it ended up costing us more to use the group-on, then to just pay out of pocket. So we asked for the manager.

WOAH. A Completely unprofessional Bald man approached us and began to RAISE his voice while telling us he does not agree with us on questioning the bill. He then stormed off and came back. After asking him what the smell of the restaurant was, he replied \" yes it is sulfur\" 

I will Definitely not be going to ANY humble pie Locations, Due to unprofessional service, Horrendous smell, and overall an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. They asked for our order immediately, almost pushy.  We asked for a moment, they ignored us for 15 mins.  Then they took our order and it took 40 mins to get 2 pizza pies.  We ate and it took another 15 mins to get our check after we asked for it.  The pizza was good, but not worth the price.  The service is definitely where this place falls apart.  Also, the servers had no insight into their pizzas.  We asked what they recommend and the waiter said he didn't know.  I won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is my favorite brick over pizza spot, which is conveniently located in the Coronado historic district. It is comparable to both Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco. However it has the most tasty pizza of the three. They have a bar with mediocre beers on tap. It is a nice spot with great food to take a date. They have both patio and indoor seating. It is moderately priced and conveniently located to many Downtown Phoenix places of interest, but probably not within comfortable walking distance. However, it is an inexpensive Uber or Lyft ride to many nearby destinations. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"With a mixed bag of reviews I was a little reluctant to stop here for lunch. After a little debate we decided to try it for ourselves. We were seated quickly upon arrival, promptly served drinks, and within about 5 minutes we had placed our orders. 

We ordered 4 different pizzas and some side salads from the lunch special option. The Cesar salad was great and my wife had no complaints with the chopped.  Solid serving size and out quickly. 

I got the meat lovers pizza, wife got the BBQ chicken, my son had pep and cheese, and mother in law had the goat cheese and tomato. All pizzas were served hot, fresh, and at one time. 

I tasted all four and I would say in my preference order it would be: meat, BBQ, pep, goat. The goat cheese was very good just not my cup of tea. No complaints from this entire visit. 

The place looked great, staff was friendly, and food matched the pair. Very pleased and we will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was burnt.  The server placed the pizzas on the table and acknowledged it but \"they had a lot of pizzas in the oven, sorry...\".  They asked if we wanted another but we didn't have time to wait.  Nothing taken off the bill.  Just burnt pizza.  The veggies were so burnt on mine that I couldn't tell what some of them were. The amount of cheese was sparse too.  Maybe go when it isn't busy so your food is better than ours was, even though at 5pm when we walked in there were only three other tables."}
{"text":"The husband and I dined there on its second night.  We normally wait a couple weeks before we try out a new restaurant, but we live in the neighborhood, so we decided, \"Why not?\"  We got there around 6:45pm and got a table right away.  

I had never heard of burrata so I had to see what is was about.  For appetizers, we ordered the caprese.  Omg.  The burrata was so delicious.  The creamy texture of it was so amazing.  And the tomatoes!  They are McClendon Farms tomatoes and they were heavenly.  Juicy and bursting of flavor.  It was if they just picked it outside.  

My husband had their steak salad.  The steak was tender and juicy and he really liked the fresh greens and vinaigrette.  I ordered the shrimp + burrata pie. I liked the dough -- crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside (the way I like it).  The shrimp was fresh and I love the hints of lemon zest and spicy red pepper flakes.  

We also had the olive oil gelato.  Delicious and the olive oil taste was very subtle.

The prices are a little high for a pizzeria, but if they keep using fresh produce from McClendon Farms, I will gladly pay for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is great! We love Italian but hadn't found a casual Italian takeout place we liked. Others have been tasty but pricey or not so tasty. And then we discover Humble Pie. Quick takeout, yummy food and reasonable prices. Win, win and win!"}
{"text":"Great food, Adam is such a friendly and professional bartender/server. Clean, great atmosphere. I'm a regular now."}
{"text":"It's in an airport so just expect to overpay and don't complain about prices. The Bloody Mary was good, not outstanding. The well is Smirnoff so not bad. Ordered a egg and sausage wrap which I guess took  a wrong turn somewhere and did not show up until 30 min later and only after I asked where it was. Obviously got lost in shuffle because it came out right away and hot so it was just made. Hey things like that happen but would have been decent for them to not charge on the missing wrap."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Waiter very attentive. Ravioli appetizer and salad was very good."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is one of my favorite places to eat for a good price! On Thursday nights they have a date night which is really worth it! You each get a salad, and app to share and a pizza all for 20 bucks! I usually try to buy the Groupon when I go but this is a great place. 

A while back I had an issue with them but how the manager handled it, surprised me. I came to HP with a friend and the food and service were great, I had no issues. It wasn't until I saw my bank statment that I had been charged $5 more that I remember leaving. I contacted the restaurant and the manager told me that he would look into it right away. I also contacted my bank as well to check if it was on their end. The manger had stayed in contact with me for the next couple of days and had told me that he had checked the receipts that night, and everything looked good. He also told me to come back in and meet with him so he can refund my money back to me. When I had met with him he told me that he couldn't just give me my $5 back so he ended up giving me $15 and he was very apologetic towards the confusion. 

I later found out that the problem was on the banks half and they too gave me my $5 back, so I guess you can say I got the better deal!"}
{"text":"I ordered the meatball hoagie which was fine  - Costco meatballs, provolone slice, and bland red sauce for 10 bucks subways meatball sub is better

The sig other tried the vodka sauce which was horrendous -  tasted like Kraft parm 
cheese from the shaker mixed with water and cream and some pink food coloring as there was absolutely no tomato flavor or bite to the sauce and yeah no vodka flavor"}
{"text":"The service is quick and the food is delicious ! 
I recommend going in for the lunch special it's a steal! 
Their best pizza is definitely the goat cheese and sundried tomatoe! Salad of course is the strawberry and Gorgonzola! This is my go to!"}
{"text":"30 minutes in between connecting flights and my stomach is in need.  It's also 8 AM.  Sky Harbor has a lot of options and I need to settle on one and get to my gate fast.  I scan the terminal, Terminator style, and settle on Humble Pie.  The play on words won me, what can I say. 

Digression:  Airport breakfast is depressing.  I'm walking by burger restaurants, pizza places, pubs and the like, all the while my head is telling me, \"It's early, you should have something simple like eggs and hashbrowns\" while my heart is telling me \"Get what they specialize in, you'll regret going to a pizza place and getting eggs.\"  I listened to my heart, much like Roxette encouraged us all to do in '88.

I chose the Margherita pizza and it was very good.  The crust had a great char on it and crisped up nicely while still leaving the inside fluffy.  The toppings tasted like quality toppings to me.  The cheese had a good saltiness to it and the basil was shredded, which is good by me.  The whole basil that sometimes goes on Margherita pizza always ends up sluffing off in one bite, the shredded allows it to distribute more evenly.  Portion size was also good, I was full but not sickly full.  The wait time for the pizza cut it close for my boarding call, so maybe not a good option if you don't have at least 20 minutes to wait for your order."}
{"text":"If you want to try something similar to cardboard and worse than a frozen pizza this spot is for you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time after hearing several friends enjoy their visits. Read plenty of reviews both positive and very negative but went yesterday for the Thursday night date night special, 2 salads, appetizer, and a pizza to share for $20. Not a bad deal.

Caesar salad was quite good, my wife's strawberry and Gorgonzola salad was good for her, I don't like that kind of thing. The salads are a very decent to big portion. 

We got the Caprese appetizer (which is a half order with the special), which is four pieces, and the S.O.P. pizza. 

Service was decent, however the inside where we sat, as the patio was packed, was less than 1/3 full of roughly 20 tables. But still quite noisy. 

The pizza is OK at best, nothing special. Quite a few fun and different choices. However, the pizza is a 9in pizza, which is fine for sharing, with thick outside fluffy crust, but very thin crust on the bottom. Thin to the point that is is soggy and the toppings fall off when you pick up a piece, so a knife and fork are required. 

All together for a $20 dinner for two, it is a good deal for the money. However, if you are planning to order alcohol, beware. $7 for a small brandy style glass of Sangria, or $4 for a 12oz domestic is quite steep. Happy hour and the Thursday night date night is a decent value for your money. However if you are coming for anything else, salads at $6-$10/each, appetizers for $5-$13/each, and very average pizza for $10-15 for a personal pizza, there are far better places in the area to visit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza and sandwiches. Went with a group of ten and they were incredibly accommodating and attentive. The meatball pizza was stupendous!"}
{"text":"Tried Humble Pie because of the groupon and was excited when I saw the menu online. Walked in and we got a table that must have been the most wobbly table I have ever seen in a restaurant. I felt I could live with it so our server brought our drinks. Looked at the priced in the menu and they seemed kinda pricey for what I wanted so I went with the half chopped salad. It took a while to get our food. While people that ordered after us were receiving their food. Finally our food came out and it tasted good so that is why they get three stars. The problem was the service. It took long also to receive the bill and to have the server pick up and run the card."}
{"text":"Great service beautiful sitting outside. So many choice's but the 3 pizzas we did decide on we're great and the Mac n cheese is yummy. I have been here for lunch and had food To go. Both experiences were great and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Our table of 12 (children and adults) had a wonderful evening dinner at HP. The service was great and the quality as well as all the different pizza's were fantastic. They do have big screen TVs and were accommodating when ask to change to Dbacks game. The noise level was customer friendly as I all at table were able to engage in good conversation. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I was expecting, but it was great nonetheless. Three of us went for lunch on Mother's Day this year. The pizzas are AWESOME, the service is better than most places I've been to and since we went on Mother's Day, every woman got her pizza for free, which cut my bill in half with three people eating pizza. What could be better? I had the Margherita Pizza and Mom had the Artichoke Pizza (absolutely delicious). The Chocolate Chip Cookie w/ Vanilla Ice Cream dessert was great, too. Unlike other places, it's not as big, so there's no problem saving room for it. I have to admit, though, I was so full I didn't eat any dinner whatsoever. Wasn't hungry enough. :) If you go, go on an empty stomach, you'll need it."}
{"text":"I was not in a hurry to visit Humble Pie due to the mediocre reviews here.  The hubs and I eventually decided to stop in for dinner after a friend recommended it and I'm so glad we did.  

The vibe at Humble Pie on 7th is definitely good, perhaps due to its proximity to the alterna/artsy Coronado hood.  Relaxed, cool people, good atmosphere and tasty food.  We decided on drinks (a beer for the hubs and some tasty tempranillo for me) and ordered a large salad and a pizza to split.  Our server was great, always making sure our glasses were full and we were happy.  The salad was tasty and our arugula pizza was so good.  Who knew arugula on pizza would be so yummy?  While I was a tad disappointed when I didn't find something super chocolatey on the menu for dessert, the apple crisp topped with vanilla ice cream was delicious.   

We've since been back for drinks and pizza at the bar.  The bar tender was very attentive and friendly and the brick oven pizza was delish.  

Humble Pie a nice place to relax and unwind with good drinks and food."}
{"text":"Horrible service for such a great restaurant. What a shame. Had 6+ people waiting with bussers making eye contact with customers and then choosing to ignore them. Hostess was non-existent. Awful."}
{"text":"The chicken parm pizza is awesome and the staff was very attentive, Jason was busy running around the bar, but I never had an empty drink! If you want good food and good service go check this place out! The only thing not giving them 5 stars is their all male staff!"}
{"text":"Love, love Humble Pie! It is very near to our home; we visit 2-3 times/month & are never disappointed! GREAT menu, service, happy hour, patio area & kids menu!"}
{"text":"My second meal here and it looks like I neglected to write a review for the first time.  My apologies!  This place deserves better from this very satisfied customer.

Apps - Toasted Ravioli is delicious!  Bruschetta is even better.  The one made with apples, Brie, agave nectar and fig jam is just incredible.  

Pizzas - all good!  I ordered the Pistachio which is a white pizza with leeks, onions, and Parmesan.  The pistachios are coarsely ground - not whole.  Probably a good thing!  I added mushrooms and Kalamata olives to it.  Delicious and perfectly baked, Neapolitan style in a wood fired oven.  So obviously, customization is not a problem.  Many thanks for that!

Parking lot is a little cramped during busy times but there is plenty of quiet street parking nearby - you won't have to hike a mile.  

Service is spectacular!  They hire the NICEST people and they are perfectly attentive without being smothering."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! Been here ten minutes. Waitress still hasn't come back. We did get drinks right away, however one was milk when we asked for root beer. Waited the ten minutes for her to come back. Took our order and the drink to replace but stopped by her friends table to chat for a minute before she finished. She came back once more throughout the dinner. Each time we got food it was from someone else and she didn't even stop to check on us. We ordered the date night special with an app, salads, and pizza. The kids got their dinner pizzas when we got our appetizer 20 minutes in! And it was FRIES!! Ten min later got salads and another ten or so we got the pizza. Kids were just about done at that point. Ridiculous!! Food was good but service was horrible!"}
{"text":"Shared a Caesar salad and a margarita pizza.  Both were fresh and delicious. Service was great and enjoyed the evening.  Only reason I did not give them a 5 is because they had a busy night and when we arrived it was still a frenetic pace rather than a relaxing evening.  Always enjoy our visit and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went to meet a friend - loved, loved!!  Have never been here before but have been wanting to try.   Food great, our server Lorine was awesome!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Gooooood pizza!!  Delicious!  I always attend this particular location because of the EXCELLENT customer service. Not sure why the other HP locations have such trouble with that. But this one on 64th St & Greenway have it down like a well oiled machine. Large party?  No problem. Lots of orders with particular requests? No problem. They have it covered with a smile on their faces. Orders are correct, drinks never empty and the food is perfectly delicious. I recommend this location only when it comes to Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is certainly not humble.  This bar/pizza parlor is tacky and overpriced.  A perfect example of yet another restaurant trying to masquerade as an upscale restaurant, attempting to justify high prices for mediocre, at best, food.  The atmosphere and decor is certainly not upscale, nor is the patio on a parking lot in a strip mall.  The bar and wait staff we encountered were unenthusiastic and ambivalent about the quality of the food and service.  
- Don't wast your time at this marginal chain restaurant.... there are so many, way better choices in restaurants here in Scottsdale/Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at Humble Pie at 39th Avenue and Happy Valley Road today with my family for Father's Day.   What a disappointment.  The service was poor and those of us that ordered hamburgers had to wait until everyone was half way through dinner before we got our food.  And we ordered before everyone else! On top of that our hamburgers were overcooked, the buns were dried out, and the orders were all wrong.  Even the appetizers came out late.  If we wanted anything we had to ask for it multiple times.  Definitely would not return or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Been here three times. 

Okay so the bad, no waiting area at all. Not a bench or chair. You just kind of stand in front of the door. Crust on pizza comes out burnt more often than not. Ordered a kids pizza along with our adult order which they forgot about so he ate ours. Second visit tried the kids pizza again and had no cheese at all on it, maybe ten shreds. Not Kidding! Asked our waiter if this was a mistake and he said no that's how they make it as kids don't like cheese as much. HUH? Althought he did offer to make a new one. So that would be second visit our son sits and watches us eat. I don't think so. Date night special is a good deal although we could not use a groupon on that day. Bummer!

The good, wait staff always friendly and on top of things. Salads have all been very good. Sangria is house made and delish. Garlic fries are huge and freshly cooked, easily there best appetizer. Simple but yummy. 

A bit overpriced for what they deliver but a cool little place anyway. Pizza not the best. Grimaldi's blows them away."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

I had always wanted to try its predecessor restaurant, The Living Room (which I believe was owned by the same people), but I never got around to it.  Shortly after Humble Pie opened in its place, a Groupon came out, so it was perfect timing to try it.  We bought two Groupons, and I'm so glad we did.

The first time we went, we ordered the shrimp pizza and the mac and cheese, and split both. The food came SO fast after we ordered it, and the pizza was fresh out of the brick oven. The shrimp pizza was so tasty, and the mac and cheese was sinfully rich and good. 

The second time, we went a bit lighter. The fiance ordered the chili (which is a holdover item from The Living Room menu - we had intended to try it before the Living Room closed) and a sandwich. I ordered a caprese appetizer. The chili was really good - I ended up eating half of it even though I thought I didn't want any. The caprese was soooo delicious. The mozzarella was super creamy and high quality, and the pesto was incredible. I would go back just for the caprese alone, but will certainly go back for the pizza, too. 

The prices are good - not the cheapest around, but definitely high quality ingredients and preparation for the money."}
{"text":"Came and back in for lunch today, and was lucky enough to have Patrick again!  Guy always seems to be here, and that must be good for business!  Food was awesome as usual, and service was great too."}
{"text":"I had been by this place a number of times but never stopped in until tonight.  A friend of mine that works nearby recommended and I was craving pizza so I finally went while I was in the area.

Even though it was quite busy I was seated immediately.  I ordered the goat cheese pizza and it was delivered very quickly.  However, it wasn't as good as I expected as it was loaded with red peppers and I couldn't taste the goat cheese at all.  Overall, it was very doughy and the center was a little soggy from all the peppers.  The edge of one side was burnt and blackened but they chose to serve it to me anyway.

Seating was very close and the atmosphere was very loud.  In 106 degree heat they had 2 huge windows open in order to serve the bar area on the patio.  Not environmentally conscious at all.  Thumbs down!!

I paid $20 with tax and tip for an 11\" pizza and ice tea.  Way too much for the quality and amount, but I guess the have to over charge in order to pay their electric bill for cooling the desert in summer.

In my opinion, overall it wasn't terrible but there is much better pie to be had and for a better value."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the pizza at all. It fell apart and it wasn't so flavorful. I got the buffalo pizza and the one with cheese and mushrooms and I did not like it at all."}
{"text":"I will not be going back. I was looking forward to something different than we have in Gilbert and it was...blek. 

The waitress was annoyed to service us. The pizza - not disgusting, but nothing stands out. The Margareta pizza didn't even have tomatoes. Their sauce tasted like it was poured right from a can. The lasagna had mushy soggy noodles and the same bland-from-a-can sauce. Not worth the money at all!"}
{"text":"Ordered the express lunch deal which included a salad a ten inch pizza. The salad I chose was a fresh mixture of lettuce, white beans, jicama, avocado and tomatoes. My spouse ordered the chopped salad of which he ate every bite. My pizza was a white pizza with mushrooms and pancetta. I thought the fluffy pizza dough crust was very good. My spouse ordered the meatball pizza with a red sauce base. This pizza was very good too."}
{"text":"I LOVE Humble PIe.  Today I ordered delivery through Door Dash.  I called Humble to ask what the secret was to ordering the lunch specials through Door Dash.  Humble was not aware that the option for the lunch specials wasn't available on the app for DD and thanked me for letting them know; they said that could hinder their lunch time delivery orders.  To make up for the fact that to get delivery, I had to order the whole salad and whole pizza (versus the 9.95 lunch special of a half a salad and pizza), they sent me a $20 gift card in the bag with the delivery!  SO awesome!  Thanks Humble Pie.  Your Veggie Salad and Buffalo Chicken pizza will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Arrived at 820 looking to enjoy a nice dinner. Abruptly met at the front desk by a young man and woman and were told \"ahhh we're closing the kitchen in like 15 minutes.\" We took the hint and left, not good for business to have staff greet your patrons at the door with that first impression."}
{"text":"I came to this location with my family because we bought a groupon and im sitting infront of the store and its 9:28 and a man who looked like he worked there told me there closed. Clearly the window shows 10:00. Terrible service right when i walked in."}
{"text":"$15.00 for Bloody Mary !! YIKES simple breakfast for $47.00 plus tip.  Food came out immediately and friendly  waitress.  Husband ordered a Meat Lovers Omelette and asked  \"Where' the beef\" ???"}
{"text":"our whole family love the place we are regulars since its close to home
i have tried most of the menu and its all really good
the bruschetta is a standout along with the pizza
friendly bar staff"}
{"text":"What's with the decor - or lack thereof?  Are they a sport bar? An Old diner?  Western Theme? A take out Pizzeria? (from the floor to ceiling pizza boxes stacked @ entrance?

OK, Good glass of wine specials all day for $5 (had a fabby NZ Sav Blanc).  

Good for a quality, nutritious  lunch, yes.

Luv thin-crust pizza, and yes, this is where to get it - BUT a bussel of salad greens were tossed on top of our prosciutto/pear pizza which had enough salad on top to make a litter (whoops it's called a KIT of rabbits - i never knew that !  heaven forbid I get a hoard of mails indicating i need a correction!) of rabbits really happy.  OK, so i had a healthy lunch then.  

I would like to try 1 more time - they do have some really good specials for lunch, and different days have specials of the day, such as 1/off bottles of wine - on a monday I think.  There's also a HH which was 50% off appies.  

But I don't really think it's my cup'o tea for evening atmosphere - or glass'o wine, rather."}
{"text":"We have a long list of restaurants that we have accumulated over the last couple of years and tonight we got to check off the Humble Pie. We went a little later in the night so there wasn't a wait and we were seated immediately. We ordered the fried mozzarella for an appetizer and they were delightful. They were soft and perfectly fried. We followed up with the chop salad that my husband and I shared. I loved the salad and my husband, who normally doesn't eat salad, ate the majority of it. We got the egg pizza and the homemade mac and cheese and loved both of our choices. I will definitely be going back........soon."}
{"text":"People were nice, but easily the worst pizza I've had. I only finished it because I spent $12 on a margherita pizza and I was starving. It's difficult to destroy a pizza, and they did it. Absolutely gross tasting."}
{"text":"Tried the apple/fig bruschetta... now I'm hooked.  I have to get it every single time.  

Food is excellent.  The service is usually pretty good.  And kids eat free on Sundays (at least I think it's Sunday's)."}
{"text":"If you enjoy bad manhattans, fruit flies, and cold, indifferent service, you will love this place."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Humble Pie in Peoria, but they have since shut down.  It was a favorite restaurant of ours.  So we happily drove a few extra miles to this location on Happy Valley.  And we were sorely disappointed.  

I had the chicken sandwich with red peppers and cheese.  It was awful.  I would say the chicken was definitely pumped, it was super chewy and I am pretty sure it was a tenderloin and not a breast.  (See pic for sizing)

My husband said that his burger tasted like falafel. (Fal-awful)  My teenage son who can eat and eat and eat (lineman and heavyweight in wrestling), didn't even finish his burger...this is unheard of.  He did come directly home and make a totinos pizza, so I am guessing he didn't like his burger.  My daughter did like the kids size of spaghetti, so there's that. 

We were so disappointed in this meal that cust us just under $100 with tip.  I am giving 2 stars, because our waitress was great and the restaraunt has a great ambiance and is clean. 

We aren't going back.  Which sucks, because they are locally owned."}
{"text":"Regular bar food in bar atmosphere. Tried to b hip but no go. Service extremely average. Server didn't even introduce herself.  Don't bother going. Many other better choices including OREGANOS PIZZA."}
{"text":"The place was nice but the layout was not as expected for a restaurant. One of the POS stations was close to the guest seating and caused congestion around our table. As far as the food, the pizza was ok, and for the size was slightly over priced. The drinks outside of happy hour were quite a bit more expensive than most places. Would I return? Quite possibly, but it would only be during happy hour where the prices may be a little cheaper and only if they were cheaper."}
{"text":"Had a hard time even giving them a one star. Can honestly say, store bought is better than their pie (there is a reason they don't call it pizza)!
They sure don't understand customer service, after eating our salads, the table was cleared including our forks, asked for another one and that's what we got--one fork for two people. Kind of like the commercial, \"what are we supposed to do, share the fork with the pie?\" Do yourself a favor and save $$, pick up at the supermarket and avoid HP."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant  its in our neighborhood so we go a lot. All the pizzas are good we especially like the veggie with lots of fresh produce and the sausage. 
They have happy hour every day. $5 glasses of wine and lots of choices not just two or three house wines. The servers are friendly and quick. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizzas I've ever had in all my life. Its not an exaggeration trust me. After a long flight from St.Louis to west side of the coast and a quick halt at arizona we brought our semi hungry selves to this place and we fell short of food options at the terminal we were in. We browsed through their selection of pizza to find a vegetarian option and we went with the margherita pizza topped with basil and tomatoes. Unbelievable as to how could someone completely turn around the recipe made with scramble of simple ingredients. The crust was horrible and the basil wasn't baked along with the pizza it was rather sprinkled ribbon cut over the baked pizza with just marinara.It was like the leaves were flying away as we were trying to bite into the pizza. Gosh and the price I know that its airport and its supposed to be pricey but 14 dollars for a flat iron rubber like pizza duh! Please don't eat even if you are starving you'll just end up spoiling your tastebuds."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pick up. I came in early to have a beer while I waited at the bar, but they would not let me sit there with my 15 year old son. Apparently a store policy as AZ law allows minors in a bar with a parent."}
{"text":"Love this place and never disappointed. Great service, great value especially happy hour! Love the drink and food choices and outside seating. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"my husband and I love this place! Its Magical Pizza, because its not your typical pizza place. Its got something for the more adventurous!"}
{"text":"Horrible service got here at 12 pm food didn't come until 12:55 waitress was so unresponsive out of all the places we could have chose in the airport we came in and didn't what we wanted"}
{"text":"Good food and good conversation?  Try just OK food and no conversation.  It was our first time and we met some friends on a Saturday evening.  Not sure what it's like on a week night, but it was so incredibly loud inside that we had to scream across the table to hear each other.  Really close quarters inside, which with the noise felt more like a bar than a restaurant.  The food was nothing special.  The meatball sandwich had 4 tiny meatballs and was not filling.  My wife was not impressed with her pizza, rather boring she said.  We would try again if the food was more exciting, but honestly we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie we decided to hit Humble Pie for a light bite. We got there just before 9:30. Just a few tables in the restaurant but the hostess was very friendly and we took a seat at the bar. It goes down hill from here! The waiter comes over and says he just wants to let us know they close at 10 and since there aren't many tables in the place they will be putting chairs on the tables and they want out of there. NICE! I can't believe we stayed. We ordered an appetizer and a pasta dish. Both were mediocre at best. We finished and had to wait for the rude waiter to appear with our check. We used to think it was a cute neighborhood restaurant, now, not so much."}
{"text":"I feel like 3 stars in neutral. I don't want to save anything negative because the staff was nice and friendly. It looks like a nice after bar for after work but the pizza just wasn't that great"}
{"text":"Just waited 40 minutes for a pretzel, had to board, so I cancelled it and asked for a ticket. 10 minutes later they brought the pretzel. Sure glad my fly was delayed. Unless you have a 3 hour layover, avoid this place."}
{"text":"The most delicious pizza I have had in a long time.  I order the pancetta and fried egg pizza. I paired it with the tempranillo.  Both were so tasty.  The crust was just the right thickness and was just crispy enough without being burnt."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this restaurant for my birthday.  It was an impromtu gathering so we didn't have reservations but decided to try it based on a friend's recommendation.  When the 6 of us arrived we were happy to see several open tables so we hoped the wait time would be short.  The staff seemed more than irritated that we would bother them for dinner and said that the wait would be \"very long because they were very busy\" and we were inconsiderate enough to not have reservations. (I'm adding the word inconsiderate to convey the attitude we received.  I want to make sure my review is painting an accurate picture of the service that was received.)  We should have left right away but instead walked over to the bar for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers.  We had just gotten our appetizers when we were informed that a table was now available for us.  (There were actually several open tables so I'm not sure if they were short staffed or just trying to be difficult because we didn't have a reservation.)  The service didn't improve and we suffered through dinner.  The portions were smaller than we had anticipated but the food and service was so slow we didn't dare to order more.  The drinks also left much to be desired.  The restaurant definitely missed out on revenue with their service.  We would have ordered more and spent more had the service been acceptable.  We will also never return and have passed the story of our disappointing visit to others."}
{"text":"You'll read in many of these reviews that people are excited about this location being close to home, and that probably sways the rating considerably. Normally I would have an issue with that, but in the case of this Humble, it's merited. It's a relief to have a decent pizza and non-sports bar so close, without having to negotiate the traffic of a kierland commons or scottsdale quarter. Look, the pizza is nice, it's humble pie not Bianco or Pomo, it's consistent though. The rest of the menu is also good, I really like the burgers and the salads are awesome.

In my opinion, one of the best happy hours around, especially on Monday when they offer half price on bottles of wine!"}
{"text":"Rizzo was awesome ! Best server in Tom , this place is great , quaint, and the food is good."}
{"text":"What can I say, I've been to this location at least a dozen times and never have been disappointed. We come here as a family, they have the best crayons, activities and kids menu. We come here on date night, best prices, quality of food is top notch and alcohol prices never let me down. Summer specials can not be beat and happy hour is always a joy. Come and support your local businesses, especially this one."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian pizza. Seasoning was just right. Highly recommend this Happy Valley restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this Humble Pie! Soooo close to home. I have to stop my car from driving itself here. Service is incredible. Bartenders always take ah.maz.zing care of me. Get Server Dave, if you can. Very attentive, great eyes and gooood looookin. I do love me some Desert Ridge Humble. But this location makes me happy."}
{"text":"I eat her pretty regularly  I am a resident of the area so not one of the \"winter\" people.  I always order the same pizza.  Today the pizza was really subpar. One half of the dough was cooked, the other was not.   It's a shame.  More and more of the restaurants in the area don't seem to care about the quality of their product.  They get the transient consumer who eats here once and leaves town. So theyndont care. I ate my subpar pizza because I was starving after a 5 1/2 hour flight home and needed something I thought would be relatively quick and good. If you are in town for vacay it's a decent place to go.  You'll never know if you're missing a good thing."}
{"text":"Great food, the pizza is great, and the penne vodka dish is terrific.  Some of the wait staff is good but some seem pretty disinterested.  Overall it's a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The service was slow.  Our drinks sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes before they were brought to the table.  The food was okay, nothing special.  Not sure we would go back.  The atmosphere was cafeteria like and noisy.  The only reason I rated two stars was because we had a Groupon, but not really worth the $42 for two people and two drinks!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my daughter recently and was really impressed with both the food and the friendly service. The fennel and sausage pizza is to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here so we know the staff. They're always friendly and we always get great service. If we don't like something we are never charged for it. We always sit at the bar, so Jason usually takes care of us. He is always friendly."}
{"text":"If you like  Margherita pizza...this is the best place to get it.  It has a nice crust, excellent sauce, fresh mazzerella, and basil....best pizza in Phoenix & Scottsdale to have it.  Its baked in a brick wood fired oven.  They also deliver.
It's a very casual establishment, good service, and pleasant atmosphere. They also have a beer &wine license.
Great for families, couples & individuals...they have a take out service & summer specials."}
{"text":"I love this little place! We are here often because kids eat free on Sundays.(2 kids per adult!) The pizzas are so delicious. And they have a lunch special so if you get that you can really save money on some gourmet-tasting, brick oven pizza with thin, crispy crust! The sandwiches and salads are also simple and savory! Get you a drink at happy hour and Voila!"}
{"text":"I went here for an early dinner with my boyfriend on a Monday night. It's a cute little restaurant, but I think a little pricey for what you're getting. Food was okay, but nothing to write home about. I paid $22 for a single 12 inch pizza with added artichokes. The wine selection seemed nice, but the beer selection is lacking, in my opinion. Service was okay. There were only two servers, one of which doubles as a bartender. I don't think I would go back as a first choice option. I really wanted to like this place more, but oh well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and am about to go for a third time.  Aside from the very difficult parking, and noisy admosphere, I like it very much.  I've gotten the bruschetta, which was fabulous.  The fries are amazing, and the salads delish!   I really need to try a few diffrent things, but when I enjoy certain dishes, it's hard to not order them again and again!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE LASAGNA!!!!

It comes out of a plastic baggie and gets heated up in the microwave!!  I've seen it... it was my order!  

Stick with the pizza.  At least you know it's from scratch.  Salad is typical.  Crust on the pizza is burnt, some like it that way."}
{"text":"Had more waiters standing around doing nothing than customers in the restaurant .  Spaghetti O's out of the can would have been better than the spaghetti and meatballs they serve.  Pizza was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Scottsdale and Phoenix are the last places that need another pizza joint."}
{"text":"Unreal. Crust is amazing, the place smells like what I suspect and hope heaven smells like."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Service was friendly but slow on the refill. They have lots of interesting pizzas. I will go again but not in a big hurry."}
{"text":"Always a favorite place to come to when visiting. Outstanding food for great prices. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Pizza was marginal at best.  We had started with the chicken pesto pizza which was absolutely tasteless.  The waitress was kind enough to replace it with another pizza.  We ended up getting the SOP (sausage onions) which again was very bland.  Out kids had the spaghetti which (surprise, surprise) had no taste whatsoever.  I expected it to be low sodium for the kids but at least give it some flavor.

The men's bathroom was not clean and the hand towel was jammed.  When I let the people at the front know about it they acted as if I was an extreme inconvenience.  I had to ask again for the front to get a towel or something so my daughter and I could dry off our wet hands.

Next time I want to take my family out for pizza it will definitely not be at Humble Pie.  Seriously disappointed."}
{"text":"The priority of the staff at this restaurant is side work and busing tables. This is an observation over 2 years and many visits. I keep going back because it's easy and convenient but I'm finally tired of it. Tonight we went in and sat at our table for 10 minutes with no one to even ask us for our drink order. Meanwhile, the guy that sat us felt the need to bus the table next to us over at least taking our drink order or saying anything about the fact that we'd say there so long with not even a greeting. I am extremely patient and understanding as a former server and rarely complain."}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Friendly staff. Glad we found it. They have good drink specials & happy hour too. As an Uber driver I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Our pizza was burnt and service was so slow. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is my kind of pizza. The crust is so thin and always cooked perfectly in their coal oven. Don't leave without trying the fries."}
{"text":"This is our local go to neighborhood spot for happy hours. The bartenders are great and always attentive. Food never disappoints and the happy hour menu is pretty good when it comes to price. We love the caprese and their pizzas are great also. Great patio to relax on."}
{"text":"The crust on the pies is wonderful... had a more traditional choice (pepperoni and artichoke) and a new combo (the buffalo wing) both were wonderful. the Caesar salad was fine, nothing to faint about... and the Brushetta was nice. The beer selection is a bit lame, but I'll survive. My only complaint would be that the two times we've been here, the food shows up too quickly... needs to be timed out better so we don't feel rushed. Glad we have yet another interesting place in the Hood to add to our list of go to places."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service needed to be better. I would have a few more cocktails if he would have bothered to come back to the table. The bartender had the bar and tables on the patio and inside. Hire somebody already!!!"}
{"text":"Walking into Humble Pie I was taken back to the late 70's and the pub-like pizza parlors that had peanut shells on the floor and pitchers of beer on the tables.  It was dark and cozy with a roomy, open dining area with full view of the flaming brick oven in the back.   The long bar on one side of the room opened to an outdoor patio.  It was late on a Monday night so the place was pretty empty except for a few folks sitting at the bar.

Our server was prompt and friendly, didn't catch his name but \"Rizzo\" was listed on the receipt - he was a delight.  The menu offers a nice variety of salads, sandwiches and pizza (combinations of ingredients were very creative).  He took our order quickly and our food came out piping hot and exactly as we ordered.  I thought the prices were reasonable and the pizza was larger than the pictures on Yelp had indicated so good value for the money.

We decided on the Minestrone Soup, Veggie Salad and the SOP pizza.  The salad was amazing, loaded with beans, avocado and other yummy stuff, topped with a delicious dressing.  The pizza was nicely covered with toppings, sliced Italian sausage was flavorful and the crust was perfect.  I thought the sauce was a bit tangy for my taste but my husband loved it. He also raved about the soup...\"best minestrone I ever had.\" 

Humble Pie was a hit...I'm telling all my friends.

{"text":"Great service Todd!
The food was good especially the tempura green beans YUMMY.

Pizza OK not my style! It had the cheese that looks like melted Elmer's glue, but it did taste ok. My wife said the wings were good and hot and the portion sizes were perfect. 

I got the Salted Pretzel speciality drink. WATCH OUT it is so strong which is great for drinkers but bad for wuss' like me. Anyway they were kind enough to take it off because I had to sips. 

WE will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside and enjoy the company. Marguerite pizza and bruschetta. Way too many carbs but worth it! Great staff"}
{"text":"I had a ton of fun here last night. It's busy and the atmosphere is buzzy. We stepped in the back door and of course looked a little lost because we didn't know where or how to find a seat, as we passed a waiter, he told us to just take the table we were next to. He was back in a flash to bring us some water and see if there was anything we wanted to start with. I had a White Grape Martini, very good, very crisp: I would recommend if you like martinis.  For an appetizer we had the Tempura Fried Green Beans... pretty sure those are little pods of heaven in your mouth, just sayin. Then... the main course. Humble pie offers burgers and stuff, but of course we went for the pizza. We had the potato garlic pizza and took off the leeks and added sausage. It was wonderful. I love their crust to no end. The pizza, despite being cheesy, was not greasy, which so commonly happens. The only thing I would have changed about it would be to not have the potatoes slices, but cubed instead, but it still tasted magnificent. 

Our server deserves his own section: Pretty sure his name was Rizzo, and he was HILARIOUS. He made my whole night just that much better. He was very funny and very engaged in making suggestions if we asked and complementing the selections we did make. He was just fun! 

I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, had the 9\" pizza and salad combo for $10.  Food and service was excellent.  You get to choose from their signature pizzas and salads.  Meat lover pizza was great, pepperoni was good and may be better when not compared to the meat lover.  You get a lot of food for $10, great value and quality."}
{"text":"Great lunch deal! Dinner ends up
being a bit pricey for ultra casual dining experiences. Servers were gracious & nice neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them a better rating because they have great toppings. Service was great, cute little restaurant, beer flights and wine flights, but the pizza dough was just ok.  Wasn't expecting the dough to be so \"doughy\". I was looking for that crisp dough you get at a wood fire oven place.  
I've been searching long and hard for that pizza place with an egg pizza to remind me of the pizza's I had in Italy.  
Just have to say great toppings, but work on the dough."}
{"text":"Early morning flight, not much open. Ordered an egg, bacon and cheese wrap with fruit for $10.99. They put 2 partial slices of bacon and a couple bits of egg in the tortilla and 5 small pieces of fruit. Went and complained and they \"fixed\" it. Put a maybe 1 full it the same tortilla. 

Sorry I bothered.... Horrible. Maybe pizza is better...."}
{"text":"First time ever and it was horrible. Nobody smiled, order was wrong, waitress never asked how our food was and the food was really nothing to brag about. I will not be going back"}
{"text":"My sandwich came out on the burnt side so i asked for another...10 minutes later they brought just bread..cold bread. So, I asked for another sandwich, the waitress told the cooks and I can hear them arguing with her that the original sandwich was fine. UGH!
I got a new sandwich 15 minutes later and had to get it to go at that point. And they still charged me for the sandwich!
I will never go back there again...even though it's 2 min from my house.

HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Mushroom was very good, but I've had better - 3.5 stars. 
Margherita and SOP were less than thrilling, left me wanting more - 2.5 stars each. 
Garlic fries and brussels sprouts were also underwhelming - 2 stars for both. 

Humble Pie is fine but you will probably find me at the Parlor, Cibo, or Pizzeria Bianco instead."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the pizza but our waitress was in a foul mood because of a large very demanding party she had. She later apologized to us which was nice. We liked the food but will probably go to Cibo or the Parlor when craving pizza."}
{"text":"I uploaded a photo of my burned pizza. I don't usually complain but since I fly all the time and only had a few minutes for food I was completely disappointed! They could do way better for the price."}
{"text":"Our server Rico was incompetent. He didn't acknowledge us for 20 minutes after we were seated, yet walked past us about 5 times before he even brought waters. Then he was surprised we were ready to order and get the smaller happy hour pizzas. We ordered a bottled of wine and it was warm, we suggested he bring something with ice and a glass of ice to chill it. He and the bartender disappeared. He didn't open it. In fact we didn't see him until he brought the check. He ordered the wrong pizzas for us. Then we saw him and the hostess take the pizzas to another room and eat them and negligent customers. He never once apologized or asked how our meal was. So disappointing. If you ask me today i do not recommend, when Lori is on she is fantastic. I wont go back unless i know Lori os working and she appreciates her customers. Rico didn't acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Date night was cool with my wife, margaritas are decent, bracetta was amazing! Same with pizza, music being played was perfect ."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this with saying that I've only ever had positive experiences here the multitude of times I have been here. Although, I was lucky enough to receive the same server every time. I don't know his name but he was wonderful; however, this experience was so frustrating I felt the need to share in hopes management will become aware and make changes. 

So a friend and I arrive last night at 6pm. It was not busy but a few others were seated. We choose a high top table next to the bar/pizza oven and are greeted by our server, ETHAN. He brought us water and said he would be back to take our drink orders. 

This is where it goes downhill. We wait for about 10 minutes and he has not returned. We aren't in a rush and gave him the benefit of the doubt. He might be busy or doing things in the back. So he comes out, makes eye contact as I wave, and continues to walk by us. He continued to walk by us for another 15 minutes while making eye contact with me and passing directly next to our table. He then seats a table directly behind my chair and returns promptly to get their drink orders and appetizers, still ignoring us. Finally, around 6:30 he walks by the table. I proceed to get his attention as he stops and LOUDLY complains to another employee about how those customers were stupid and \"only tipped $7 what the hell\". 

I continue to try to flag him down. Mind you, no drink orders had been taken nor our food order after being repeatedly ignored for FOURTY FIVE minutes. Then as he is bringing the table behind us their full meal, and we have been here almost an hour we get up and leave.

Ethan, if you somehow see this, serving is NOT a job you should have. You were rude and loud and awful."}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas!  Great experiences on 2 different occasions pre-ordering pizza for office parties.  

We've tried about 10 of the pizzas on the menu and they're ALL delicious.  (Well, one guy didn't like the Organic Local Vegetable but I think he's just a veggie hater.)

Easy to order online, then swing by to pick up.  

FYI pizzas are small - each serves 1-2 people depending on your appetite.  Guys would probably want their own.  Not a bad idea to also order an appetizer -- even if you have leftovers this pizza tastes great the next day!"}
{"text":"The Good:
Pizzas are large enough to share. Salads are tasty and pizzas are good. Pizza dough has the right amount of toasted crunch

The bad: Service is lack luster, no real effort to wow the customer.

The real bad: There is a very strong & pungent foul (sewage) odor as soon as you enter the front door.

If management is reading this; you really need to get this fixed!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  My family and I went there because of the favorable reviews.  My meat lovers pizza was good as were the other pizzas we ordered.

My father ordered the spaghetti with meat balls.  Awful!  I mean, seriously not good spaghetti.  How do you not make passable/decent spaghetti with meat balls?  We told the waiter of our displeasure and he did make good on the meal.  I got the feeling that they had heard that before.  If so, then they should make a better spaghetti sauce.  

The roasted olive appetizer was good but the calamari we ordered was just ok.  For the money I expected much better calamari.

The service was very good and the waiter had a great attitude.

In short, stick with beer and pizza at this place and you'll be ok.  Would I go to this place again?  Yes, but I'll stick with the pizza and olive appetizer and beer."}
{"text":"A Co-worker of mine lamented last week \"have you tried Humble Pie?, it's said to be the best pizza in Scottsdale.\" I had a hard time believing this, better than Grimaldi's? Better than Nello's? Then I hoped on Yelp, saw some favorable reviews and decided, hey maybe it is!! So Husband and I ventured up north to the Tatum location on Saturday night. We instantly  noticed the open kitchen centered around the wood oven, the place was hoping. This must be good. After waiting for what seemed like several minutes the waitress finally arrived to take our drink order. Husband ordered and Shiner Hefe and I went with the featured Limoncello Margarita. Several minutes passed once again, and finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken. The first sip I took of my cocktail was like a punch in the gut. I am all for strong drinks, better value. This was strong to the point that it really was not enjoyable. Figuring it may take awhile we started with the antipasto board. I ordered the Egg pizza, Husband seemed delighted by the idea of the Coppa pizza. When the Antipasto arrived we were pleased, it was simple and amazing. Small bites of meats, cheeses, olives, marinated tomatoes accompanied by crusty bread. Now, slow, inattentive service, and bad cocktail aside, we were ready for the pizza. My pizza of whole mozzarella and prosciutto was topped with a sunny side up egg. It was good not great, the egg added a nice flavor that complemented the smokey prosciutto and crust. It did seem however it was really salty. I know prosciutto is a salty meat, but this tasted like the cheese and crust were carrying a good dose
, just in case. I asked husband about his pizza, and he commented the same, very salty. We finished what we could of our salt licks and waited, and waited for our bill. I wanted to really like this place, but the slow service and salty pie left me feeling very meh, While the antipasto was good for my money I will take Grimaldi's, Nello's, La Grande Orange or Bianco any day."}
{"text":"I don't recommend it. The waiter, who clearly has no serving experience gave us very poor service. It took forever to get our drinks, he stood around and talked while we were all waiting to order, and he started his side work after our food was delivered and never checked in with us (when people needed additional things delivered). The local vegetable pizza was bland and boring. The artichoke pizza was pretty good but shouldn't of been ruined with a bunch of green olives (which seems to be their vegetable topping of choice). Their pizzas are small and overpriced. Their caesar salad was ruined with celery. I desperately wanted some dipping sauce (like marinara or vodka) to go with the large amounts of crust I was left with but never got the opportunity to ask; since I never saw our waiter again till our check came. The only chance of me coming back is for happy hour when I can get an inexpensive glass of wine."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Fair wine selection.  Only pizza place in Desert Ridge?  Makes it better by default I suppose.  Kind of a theme up here.  Everything is \"the only\" whatever.  \"In and out\" is the only drive through fast food place.  Albertson's (nee Safeway) is the only grocery store.  The gas station.  Target is The big box shop."}
{"text":"The food is good the staff is friendly. Parking is horrible and it's not the quickest place to eat to be honest. If you are looking for good artistic fun pizza with some different choices then usual this place is good if you want a Slice of New York style this is not the place to go. I'll most likely be going back. As an update the place has been crossed off our lunch group list at work because it just takes too much time to to get your food."}
{"text":"I have recently started writing reviews about establishments I visit and I have to say that it's a little addicting. I seem to write more favorable reviews, however, I do have a good review and not so great one.  I visited Humble Pie on 7th st/McDowell as I haven't for some time. I love the food, it's awesome and the goat cheese pizza is heavenly. I typically sit at the bar and did again of my visit. I have to say, I like the restaurant a lot better when the Asian bartender isn't working. She is just not personable and always looks like she is going to blow a gasket.  I found out that she is the manager. She needs to pull it together. On on visit we were greeted by a lisa or lea, regardless, she was awesome and took care of us. Everything was on-time and perfect. I also like the busers/food runners. It's really hot in that kitchen and small, but they are always so pleasant when bringing the food around. That bartender should take a tip. It's the details and food that keep me coming back. All and all, eat at Humble Pie. It's quaint, delicious, and typically great service. Don't forget to eat a pazookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good breakfast food at gate A23. But even better was the service. Warm and personable staff in a world that is too often transactional."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I just had lunch here, we could smell the food from down the street and couldn't stop thinking about it, so we decided to give it a try. I don't give reviews often at all, but this place is a gem. The food is fresh and AMAZING, and the service is just as worthy of the five stars. Our waitress was awesome and knowledgeable, and the prices are so affordable! I will be back soon for the dinner specials! Highly recommend 5/5."}
{"text":"First time to this location, no better than the other one I went to. We sat at a pub table near the wall- small so not a lot of good seating, the bar was full of a group who knew each other.
We ordered drinks and happy hour mozzarella- the mozzarella was very good, the tea- average. We ordered minestrone soup- it came out when we had our first bite of our appetizer so I asked them to hold on the pizza so we could catch up, but no... it came out after a couple more bites, so we had all 3 courses on the table, getting cold and feeling rushed. The soup had large noodles, a mishmash of veggies- never seen peas in it and thin slices of sausage. It was not very flavorful and I was not impressed. The pizza was ok-not thrilling, very small for $16.00!! 
A solo musician was coming in to start playing as we were finishing- of course!
I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Most overpriced airport food I've had all year. $13 for an individual margarita pizza ($4.50 more if you want to add pepperoni!!) Seriously $17.50 for an Individual pizza that was mediocre at best (and almost all crust). Even NY and DC airports are cheaper. Would recommend Sauce over this place any day for pizza at Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner. Crazy 100 degree weather and a hot kitchen,  they had a power surge. Manager Kendall was gracious with an angry customer and waiter Jake stayed calm and helped with another Togo customer.  Great staff and very good food.  Thank you."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I have never experienced the problems with service that some people have mentioned. We are \"locals\" from the Coronado neighborhood, so we are here at least once a week and we have visited at various times of the day. The one time service was slower than usual, our waiter apologized without us having to ask questions and he gave us a discount - nice touch. 

As for the food, I am a big fan of the salads, especially the veggie salad, which is not the typical bowl of cold romaine lettuce with hunks of tomato and red onion. This one has enough ingredients to make it a satisfying meal. It is not cheap, but I couldn't make it at home for any less, considering everything that is in it.

A local's tip - go for happy hour and order a martini. The pomegranate with cinnamon is dangerously good, especially for the 4 bucks at happy hour. Add in a side of tempura green beans and you are good to go until dinner time."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Reasonably priced. Great drinks. Cute ambiance. Nice place to meet and eat. Everything just came together. My server Fernando took great care. My favorite was the wedge salad!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The lunch deal is a good option for $10/person since you get a pretty good amount of good food!

I had their cranberry walnut salad (I think that is what it was) and it was delicious!

Then this last time I got the wedge salad-- the lettuce was limp, some parts were turning brown.  No big deal I figures-- boy was I mistaken... stomach aches for the next three hours here we come!

Also, the grilled chicken that we requested on my friend's salad tasted like processed meat, it was weird, but it tasted like the chicken you get from McDonald's.

Anyway, I would come back for sure, but I think I'm going to go with the pizza next time, since it seems like you can't really go wrong with that option.

Parking is awful between 1130 and 1230, so be sure to avoid those times, or just be ready to lurk for a spot for a few extra minutes.

The wait staff is really fantastic and they do just about anything to make you happy, even if they seem like they have an attitude, they're really willing to help out as best they can to make the experience pleasant for you."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and waitress was very sweet, but right when you walk in, you are greeted with the dining room which felt super dirty. Old chairs with big holes and sticky dirty tables and just overall unkept and old looking. The table was so sticky it literally had to be scrubbed after we sat down and even then it was still gross. The pizza was delicious however, but small. We also ordered the mozzarella sticks and they were yummy cubes instead of the usual stick with delicious marinara sauce. The music playing was 90's rock at 2 in the afternoon, would have preferred something a bit classier. Also, the bathroom was super dirty. Has the potential to be a 4 star if they fixed the place up and cleaned"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would give this place a try since we had heard how great their food is.  It wasn't so much the food that I'm giving this establishment a 3 star, the food we ordered was ok, not bad but not the best the salad was to soggy and the crust on the pizza seemed to be under cooked.   The restaurant didn't appear to be clean and had a horrible smell. We haven't gone back not impressed."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have always enjoyed it! We loved the chicken pesto and meat lovers pizza! We splurge on the bruschetta because it's fun, but buyer beware it's a bit overpriced. Make sure you get the Groupon though, you pay $11 for $20. Staff is always on top of things also! Be sure to let them know if it's your birthday, you can get an ice cream and chocolate chip pizza dish!! Although we learned that you can't do the Birthday treat with the Groupon, but that seems fair to me you know."}
{"text":"This is the second time we tried this place, and I'm still not impressed. When we came in there was one other table, but no employee. When one did come out we were told to sit wherever we wanted. No hello, no sorry to keep you waiting. The waitress came again no sorry to keep you waiting or any type of greeting, and no eye contact. We ordered a goat cheese pizza no real flavor and the cheese was dryer out. The cheese pizza was nothing special. We also ordered a chopped salad and a caprese sandwich, nothing had anything special to them. Flavors were bland and boring. With their prices you would think service and the food would be better, but it wasn't and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Early Flight. I googled restaurants open in the airport at 0515 am. Humble Pie said to open at 0530 am. Walked across airport to eat here instead of a walk up since I'm in a wheelchair and those spaces are hard to manuever and manage your food. 
0530 comes and goes. Around 0540 ask when they open and guy mumbles something about not serving alcohol until 0600 am. I don't want alcohol, I need food.
People milling around, then some group meeting, more milling around, no sense of urgency. More people coming up asking if open. Meanwhile, other 2 walk ups are open next door.
We didn't eat here. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Since they've opened their door almost a year ago I've frequented this joint once a month or so.  I always sit at the bar, which is fan-cooled during the summer months and heated during these chilly wintery nights.  

Their pies are consistently delicious, especially the Shreiner's sausage with fennel.  Their sides are ok, not bad, not amazing, but are ok.  I've recently fallen in love with their calamari appetizer.  Perhaps it's just the combination of breading + deep-fried that pushes all the right buttons for me, but whatever it is, it's delicious whether served with the basil chili sauce, a garlic aioli or the marinara.  

The only pizza I haven't been a huge fan of is their potato and gorgonzola.  However, this was more of a mistake on my part; I dislike gorgonzola intensely, and for some reason still thought it might be a good idea to order that pie, hoping that the gorgonzola would be minimal... it wasn't.  My bad :P.

But in addition to their delicious pizza is a fairly comprehensive wine and beer collection.  If you want to experience a zillion beers, this is not the place, but they do have something on tap for every palate, from hefeweizen to a nice IPA."}
{"text":"I visited Humble Pie the first time this evening and it was simply an amazing site to see. After orders were placed, the meal turned into a total meltdown.  My request was rather simple, a sourdough cheeseburger without grilled onions. The first meal arrived incorrect and I ended up splitting off of those in my party because they felt bad I was not able to eat.  A second burger was about to be delivered to the table when the server and kitchen staff started yelling at each other. 

The manager seemed ill-equipped to address the situation. Rather than acknowledge the error, we sat at the table and watched things unfold.  Regrettably, we could not order another round of drinks because the manager or server did not want to come to the table as they felt it better to ignore the situation. Frustrated, I called out for the check and was simply advised \"the burger was taken off the bill\" which seemed like an obvious option.  I was not expecting to be sent on my way without someone dealing with the customer service issue.  The server apologized and agreed with my \"s**t show\" description of what happened.  I was advised that \"nobody in the kitchen speaks English and that this happens often\".  

Too many others places in Desert Ridge to eat. Go elsewhere for a meal without the show."}
{"text":"Stopped here before heading to Albuquerque, NM. The pizza was good but of course it comes with the airport price :/ I ordered the pepperoni pizza, loved the pepperoni's. My family ordered the breakfast it enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Fun retro vintage atmosphere and great Pizza and Beer. Customer service is okay."}
{"text":"Not sure why people are handing this place negative reviews.

Our pub pretzel was great, the Brie was fantastic. FANTASTIC.

Pizza was great.

Environment was great.



Beer selection could use some love.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Stopped here during the Southwest Airlines system outage debacle. Had a few glasses of wine, lots of club soda, and the Artichoke Pie. The service here was surprisingly top notch, which I typically would not expect for an airport restaurant. Eric was my server, he was very friendly, fast, and efficient. One of the best servers I've had in a long, long time.

The Artichoke pie was really tasty. Artichokes, green olives, carmelized onions, and ricotta cheese -- very interesting combination of flavors."}
{"text":"Boy it is 6;15 and the cook says they are closed????? Cook is making her own pizza???? For shame! Supposed to be open til 10 pm,what up with that?"}
{"text":"I took my sister here to try something new and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and they offered a wide variety of speciality pizzas. I will have to go back to give them a try because I'm sure they are all equally delicious. 
The staff was excellent and provided the best customer service. We were kindly welcomed and seated right away. Our server was friendly and knowledgable, he made excellent suggestions. Matt was fantastic. I think he's one of the managers here. He walked over to check on us like most managers do, but this was different. He was professional and genuine it just really made us feel welcomed and appreciated for our business. It's not often you get that quality of an experience. 
I would definitely recommend Humble Pie to my friends and family."}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour every day! $2.50 for Four Peaks Kilt Lifter is a pretty good price.  The pizza was fresh and had good flavor. At happy hour you can get a couple of different ones to try and not break the bank. We opted for the regular size meat lovers. The meatballs were a little dry - but I don't think there's not much to be done about that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars but the service was atrocious. The host was very friendly and sat me at the bar as I needed to finish some work. After about three minutes of the bartender just standing there sighing I asked her for a menu. She handed it too me...a few minutes later asked the guests to the left and right of me what they would like and completely ignored me. The gentleman to my left said \"I believe this lady would like to order too as you've been ignoring her.\" She then proceeded to tell us that she just got off break so that's why she wasn't paying attention because she assumed I was already helped. She was very rude. I ordered the prosciutto & fig pizza...it was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be back to a Humble Pie, but never this one."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pesto pizza, which was solidly in the \"atrocious\" category. Largely bland, astonishingly greasy, and left me feeling both unfulfilled and mildly ill. In an airport with a lot of bad options, this really is one of the worst."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and I have enjoyed both the food and the service.  While the pizza might not be on the level of Pizzeria Bianco, I thought it was very good and for lunch, they have a great deal.  For $9.99, you choose a salad and a 9 inch pizza- definitely a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"ehh, I've had better. Okey environment, especially during happy hour but there are a few other places nearby that I think strive to achieve more."}
{"text":"Like many of the restaurants in PHX terminal four Humble Pie started out as a restaurant in town and has opened an outlet at the airport.

Food here is on par with what they've got at the other restaurants and that makes Humble Pie a standout at the airport.  Sat at the bar since I was traveling solo, service was great,  Especially since this is an airport and they have quick turnover of the seats.

I had the mushroom pizza, it was good, not something I'd usually order and honestly probably wouldn't again but it was good and I could appreciate it for what it was.  I guess that's a good way of summing up Humble Pie in terminal four, it's enough of an escape from traveling you might forget you're in the airport just looking for a quick mouthful, you can actually enjoy your meal enough to order something different and know it will be good.

I'll be back, and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"best blt in the world!!!  I always make time before my flight to get this treat.  Fresh homemade bread and just the right amount B L and T.  Skinny fries too?  Makes the busy concourse experience a little better."}
{"text":"The service was fine they showed up before expected delivery time but the food was mediocre. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza and it had almost no pesto sauce and was dry and a little cold. We also ordered the calamari and it was dry and chewy. Probably wouldn't order again"}
{"text":"Lunch special is my favorite. Great and quivk service.   I love this place.  If your into it try the BBQ Pizza, biffalo chicken && or Shrip pizza . #Bomb But you really cant go wrong i come here often i always try something different i haven't been disapointed yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing the pizza was delicious!  The fresh basil on it was the best. The staff very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the pies. Outdoor seating  area is a bit tight, but not uncomfortable. The pizzas weren't mind blowing, but if you are in the area and are in a pizza mood, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like humble pie! Love to order a salad and some pizzas. There are interesting/different toping combinations and they have all tasted great! The fried egg on top of a pizza is a unique and delicious take on pizza. Good dinner specials on various days of the week too!"}
{"text":"Best sausage and fennel pizza I've ever had!  I crave it!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"We went there tonight and it was very crowded. I know that we all are excited to have a unique restaurant in the area but our service was also terrible. There were 2 adults and two young children in our party which makes slow service seem even slower. The waiter forgot to put in our order then admitted he had lost it. I explained after watching people seated after us already eating that my kids would take ANYTHING. It still took a while. Then one appetizer came out a while  later they brought one pizza to our table and attempted to give us one that we didn't order. At that point we asked for more silverware and plates. The next pizza came but no plates or silverware. Finally the bruschetta appetizer came. We asked again for plates and silverware. After our third request to three different people someone brought us plates but only after we were almost done eating. The server then came to us and explained they had comped the bruschetta as well as discounting our whole bill and apologized. We asked for a box at that point and thank goodness we had cash because he never came back. I would think that if you knew your service was that terrible you would be keeping very close track of your table. 

I think the place is new, pretty small and very crowded. Obviously the management doesn't have the staff they need. The food was very good and we will try it again especially since it is biking distance from our house but not for a few more months...."}
{"text":"Taken aback by the prices, but one is a captive audience in an airport.  Ordered the the mushroom pancetta.  Was asked, would you like the pancetta?  Um yes.  Got pizza.  No pancetta.  Completely flavorless hot goo mess $15 \"pizza\".  Skip this place."}
{"text":"We stopped here to grab a bite while we waited for our flight. The seating was packed, though the food was pretty quick to be prepared. The pizza...nothing to brag about. It was basically the same as eating a frozen pizza, but marked up in price and with a few spices added on top. The sauce and crust were bland and unremarkable."}
{"text":"We were lucky to pull up and find a break in the crowd and get into eat.  We were sat immediately and Callie took our drink order, she was very bubbly, friendly and has a very quick wit!  I felt like we were among family with the way we were able to banter with Callie and how we got along so stellar.  She had some great recommendations which I adhered to and I don't regret it!  I went with the shrimp pizza, it was fantastic!   Of course I had to start with the meatballs, that is always a must!  The pizza is supposed to come with red pepper flakes, I passed on those, but there is a sweetness to the pie from the basil and it really makes it grand!  So give it a shot and when you get there ask for Alvernon, aka Callie, tell her Joe sent ya!!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a coworker. I had a lunch special off the lunch express menu. I got the strawberry salad  and the half chicken sandwich. 
They always have specials so be sure to check that out on Sunday or Wednesday! Sundays kids eat free and Wednesday half bottles of wine. The ambiance is nothing special but not bad...I would say Humble Pie is average."}
{"text":"Went to Humble Pie for a laid back Valentine's Day dinner with my husband and it was fantastic. We made reservations because we assumed Valentine's day would be packed (and it was). We were immediately seated even though we arrived 20 minutes earlier than our reservation and our server stopped by shortly with waters for us and asked for our drink order. A friend recommended their red wine blend to me but didn't know what it was called. I asked the waitress if she knew which one my friend was talking about and she immediately pointed out the correct one on the menu. I am so happy I ordered it! It was fabulous (Murietta in case anyone is wondering) and a great compliment to my dinner.
Anyway, they had a Valentine's day special (1 app, 2 salads, 1 pizza, 2 cookies) so we started with the cheese and meat board for our app. It was fabulous - 3 cheeses, 3 meats, fresh bread, olives, and tomatoes. Delish! Next we both ordered the chopped salads which were super fresh and very tasty! Then we got the pepperoni pizza and it was awesome. By thing point we were stuffed and could only eat half of it! We took the other half of the pizza and our cookies to go. 
We had a great experience and great food. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Food is very subpar. Little Asian at the front serves no purpose, doesn't talk and just texts the whole time. My server didn't check on me once. I had an issue with my food and she didn't check til it was cold and I had to check out to board my flight."}
{"text":"Only tried the bar before boarding a plane but the staff were quick & helpful which is more than I can say for their neighbors. I've tried the pizza at the downtown location & the pizzas coming out looked good too."}
{"text":"Ok ...  This place  is just alright.  Nothing special.  There pizza sauce needs help.  There crust looked and tasted OK. But there a 3 special ingredients missing in there tomato sauce.. The waiter was not enthused when I asked what is popular on the menu. The antipasta board was not good.  This place needs Gordon Ramsay's help seriously"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Humble Pie's pizza. I opted for the express lunch which included a 10 inch pizza and a half salad. I chose for my salad the chopped salad, which was actually very good. The lettuce was fresh and the flavor was pleasant and tasty. However, for my pizza I chose the meat lovers and it was VERY disappointing. Flavor was off and not well balanced. The pizza was sloppily put together as if the toppings were thrown on in an effort to be as fast as delivery pizza, and the consistency was very flimsy. I picked up the first piece and it folded down and all the toppings fell off. For as expensive as even the lunch special is, it was not worth the $13."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the wings were horrible.  Remove them from the menu and save your customers from wasting money."}
{"text":"The Wedge Salad is totally legit.  Pizza is solid, it delivers what you want from a pizza, not too much not too little.  Customer service is reliably there, without being totally there.  You know what I mean, a perfect balance."}
{"text":"To be honest this should probably be a two star. However after sitting there for 20 minutes at a table with my three-year-old not having even been brought a water I am furious. I have been to this location several times every time I have had terrible service this time however was the worst. After sitting there for so Long and my child asking for water I decided it was time to leave. Because of my hungry and thirsty child I did not have time to speak with a manager hopefully one reviews these comments. I love the pizza at humble pie  but I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Took a while for our server to recognize us, but we entered at the peak of their business. They do an early dinner crowd for the older folks and then it turned into a ghost town after 7pm. We all had good meals and shared the meatball appetizer. My chop salad (large) was enormous and delicious, only thing I would have added was banana peppers. Kids pasta and corn dog and fries were fine. Wife's chicken sandwich was good. Solid bottle of Tempranillo and we were done with a $78 bill not including tip. Would go again. I am carb free right now which is why no pie :-)."}
{"text":"Cale is AWESOME!!!!!!!......... Raspberry Lemon Drops are sooooooooooo AMAZING!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the menu; it was small but included everything you would want. They have many interesting items on the menu, too. They have a very good lunch offering, and a great beer menu. The wait staff is efficient and very friendly. I look forward to coming back to Scottsdale so I can eat there again. I did not try any of their appetizers, so next time it will be during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Came here after an afternoon at Odysea aquarium. The toasted ravioli was good. I had the S.O.P. It was good but pricey. Think of it as a pricey fired pie or pieology. Our server was ok. He was younger and seemed \"distracted\". The place in general was nothing to brag about. I don't care to be back. You can get a better pizza for a cheaper price and better experience somewhere else."}
{"text":"Humble pie and its staff is awesome!! I am in there all the time for happy hour and the staff there is great to be around. As well the great staff the food is hands down the best! There pizzas have great flavor and our cooked to perfection. If you looking for a good pizza as well as many other great menu items this is the place!!
Enjoy"}
{"text":"If it forced to eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza.  I never tire of pizza simply because there are so many interpretations possible, and I'm not just talking about toppings.  From the flavorless cardboard pizzas from Peter Piper (for which I will always hold a place in my heart) to the foodie favorites crafted at world famous Pizzeria Bianco, Arizona is a pizza lovers paradise.  But among all of these various pies, my very favorite would have to be the Artichoke Pizza at Humble Pie.
      Immediately upon walking into Humble Pie, you are immediately struck by the wood burning oven, where pizzas are being expertly spun in and out and onto your plate.  The heat from this oven allows your crust to be cooked within minutes, and produces a smoky black char that adds so much depth of flavor--this isn't the result of neglecting to set a timer.  The crust is able to develop this color not only because of the immense heat of the oven, but also because of fermentation of the dough.  Fermenting the dough not only aids in the cooking process, but also adds that slightly sour tang you can taste in the dough.  Developing flavors over days, rather than hours, is a testament to this restaurant's dedication to quality and taste.
      With such a strong base, it's difficult to see how you could screw up such a good thing.  While I have enjoyed many different pizzas here, my all time favorite would have to be the Artichoke.  Delicate artichoke hearts are accented with gooey fontina cheese, mild fresh ricotta, sweet caramelized onions, with the briny bite of olives to cut through it all.   Other toppings range from just as creative to the traditional cheese or pepperoni.  But don't let traditional fool you into thinks average.  Humble Pie highlights local vendors in their locally made sausages and organically grown vegetables. Anytime there are less miles between the purveyor and your plate, there is almost a guarantee that the flavor will be better.
      As for the rest of the menu, the burrata Caprese and antipasto platter starters are two of my favorites, and again highlight simple, quality ingredients.  Typically, my dining partner and I will split one of these and a pizza.  Salads are okay, but don't quite have the impact of the milky, gooey cheese of the Caprese.  I have not had their sandwiches or pasta dishes, but can only assume that with the quality of ingredients being used, there can't be much to complain about.  The kids' menu contains the usual suspects, but the pizza is of the same quality of the adult menu.  (Do be aware that the kids' macaroni and cheese is Kraft.)
       The service is always friendly, with the owner stopping by your table often, and encourages leisurely meals.  I actually chose this venue to host my birthday party, which included around ten adults and four children under the age of five.  All of the orders were correct, the quality of food just as phenomenal as always, and they were incredibly helpful with our request of separate checks.  Overall, Humble Pie is one of my favorite spots in the Valley to enjoy myself with my family and good food."}
{"text":"This is possibly the best pizza I've had in a while. It is so delicious. The margarita pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza is so yummy. My only complain is that it just can be a little expensive"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour here, just wish it went later then 6PM!  5 dollar wine and pizza!  And love the wine selection!

Potato pizza is probably my fav.  Love all the different choices, and even the pepperoni in delish.  Not to mention the BEST calamari I have ever had!"}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch. Everything was absolutely delicious. I started off with a Butternut Squash Soup that was probably the best soup I have ever tasted. ~REALLY~ A 10 inch Spicy Basil Shrimp  Pizza followed and was AWESOME !"}
{"text":"SO sad they closed! They had great appetizers and salads and pizzas..We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here..And this was also a special place for family dinners with my father-in-law who is no longer with us. We made so many memories here and they always had such delicious food. We will miss this location very much!!"}
{"text":"A yummy gourmet pizza joint near downtown without a 2 hour wait!  Humble Pie has a decent selection of fancy pizzas and one pizza is most certainly large enough for two people to share.  The menu clearly states that they don't want you to substitute any ingredients...which is a little annoying for a vegetarian.

The cream of the crop at this place is their french fries - they come piled high and are flavored with garlic, lemon, cheese and red pepper flakes...oh man.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.

We had great service here, and my water-loving boyfriend never had an empty glass - seriously, he drinks so much water. So, I just wanted to give the server and bus boy props for that!  

For the people who were fans of The Living Room (who was the previous occupant in this building), there is a little menu of \"Living Room Favorites\" that they will still serve you.  I didn't order anything from it, but I thought that was a nice added extra."}
{"text":"If I wasn't trying to cut back on carbs I'd be there more regularly but I love this place - everything on the menu is yummy. service is a bit rushed on a Friday night but that's to be expected in a good restaurant here in town. definitely recommend Humble Pie it's delish!"}
{"text":"I really like the food and the atmosphere here. The Caprese salad was absolutely delicious and I'm a big fan of the chopped salads (make sure you specify which chopped salad you want, though, got the wrong one on my last visit). My latest addiction is the artichoke pizza...oh so good! Terrific wine list, decent service. This restaurant is on my keeper list."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is calm and pleasant. Penne with Vodka Sauce was amazing and a must if you visit the restaurant! Also had the Barbecue Chicken Pizza which was great as well. Service was excellent and our server, Stuart, was very attentive. Definitely will be back again and would recommend the restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had 20 minutes before our plane took off.

We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza!

They handed us a burnt black pizza.

Somebody actually looked at this thing coming out of the oven, saw it was pitch black, and then decided it was OK to hand it to a customer ! ! !

What makes a person think that it is ok to hand a customer such garbage?

Since they care so little about the interest of the customer, it makes you think they have other issues as well, cleanliness . . ."}
{"text":"I experienced very poor customer service here before my flight.  I waited at the \"to go\" window for just over 5 min.  Made eye contact with several servers.  Was not acknowledged.  An annoyed man came over and \"gruffly\" says... \"If you want to be served you'll have to come over to the bar.\"  

Sorry, I was standing at what should allow me to bypass sitting down and ordering and waiting for a check...  No thanks.  How about you put a closed sign on the window?????  I would also suggest that you keep in mind that I am a customer.   Rude, loud and in-helpful will get you this review.  

My advice to the restaurant?   Hire and train better.   There was many better was to handle this as an employee.... For instance ,  how about a friendly greeting?"}
{"text":"We've been to Humble Pie on enough occasions that I'm comfortable summarizing it as an average three-star pizza place.  While it's certainly not terrible, you can definitely find better.  The quality of the pizza tends to be somewhat inconsistent  and at times can be quite good while at other times we've received a soggy crust with toppings that look like the kitchen staff must have had a contest to see who could stand on the other side of the kitchen and toss the most ingredients onto the crust (sadly, most of them missed).

The veggie salad was good and had interesting ingredients like avocado, green beans, white beans, and jicama that added enough zing to make the salad less than boring.  The caesar salad, however, was another story.  We were about halfway through eating it when we finally pinpointed the source of the strange taste and texture that is unfamiliar to a typical caesar.  About 1/3 of what is normally romaine lettuce actually consisted of chopped celery, which in my opinion, has no place in a caesar salad.  I'm not sure if this was just an attempt at cutting costs by adding a cheap filler ingredient, but the result was anything but delicious.

On a positive note, they do offer half priced bottles of wine on Mondays, but overall, this is just an average pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"Could not believe how great this place was, in an airport no less!
Yes, the noise was loud, because people suck, especially at airports. I had the meatballs and a nice salad. Food was so good, it made my trip less hectic, more enjoyable.
Service was exceptional as well, considering the location. If you have to eat at the airport, I highly recommend this place...and I generally hate everything. Now I have to find a reason to fly to phoenix again! Great stuff!!"}
{"text":"the best mushroom pizza ever!!!  a bit load inside and crowded tables but outside was nice."}
{"text":"So I finally got a chance to check out Humble pie on 7th st. I wanted some good pizza and wifey didn't want to go anywhere so we ended up getting takeout. In my classic move, I called in my order and then arrived early to have a drink at the bar (I always do this to A) get a beer and B) make sure I get my food right when it's ready, to ensure quality control haha. So I called in our order, and promptly drove over for an ice cold beer. The place was nice, i could see just having a beer and an app at the bar. It was very welcoming. I got this pizza with sausage, roasted peppers and ricotta that was pretty good. Wifey went with a cheese pizza to split with my daughgter. Both were pretty good, but missing the char I love from the usual brick oven restaurants. The service was great and the quality of the pizza was good, just a bit of for me. I'll go back again as I didn't have a bad experience. It beats the wait at Cibo, but I think Cibo's ;pizza is better. it's closer than LGO (to me) but LGO's pizza is better. it's not quite as good as Centurion, but a bit closer. All in all, solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! Kaytee Kelly was phenomenal! Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here one time and only had dessert. It was extremely good though and the service was decent! All their food on the menu sounded really good and I can't wait to go back and try it!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Personal size pizzas made fresh. The dough was delicious. The cheese only halfway melted, the sauce basically tomato paste. The quality could easily be improved significantly by using better sauce and cooking 2 min longer, but overall it's a pretty decent product for an airport."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza here, and it is surprisingly good for airport food. The one thing about this place that was not good was the tapwater. It tasted like it came from the ocean, as it had a very salty taste which I found undrinkable. Upon research this flavor of the water seems normal for the area, so the restaurant should not be marked down for that."}
{"text":"Lunch salads are so fresh and tasty! Enjoy the selection on the wine list! Small, intimate place! Wait staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience tonight. Was thinking of ordering my 5 year old the spaghetti & meatballs, so I asked our server \"how many meatballs come with the kids menu?\" She says, \"one.\" To which I reply, \"but the menu says meatballs, plural.\" She says \"I don't make the menu.\" Wow! Okay, moving along. Can he have the chocolate milk? They're out of milk. Can he have lemonade? Yes. Comes right back, \"we're out of lemonade, do you want Sprite?\" I don't let my 5-yr old drink Soda. What ever happened to saying, \"I'm really sorry about this but we are out of lemonade, here are some other options? 

I give her our order after she arrives with our drinks and repeats it back wrong twice. Never comes to give refills, we have to flag her down and ask.

The sauce on our side of meatballs was cold, the crust on the kids pizza was white and undercooked, my pizza was remade because the original was black on the bottom and the second server said he was embarrassed to bring it to the table. That would have been fine had the second pizza not been cold and doughy in the middle. I don't have one nice thing to say about this experience."}
{"text":"Delish as always. Enough said. Perfect size pies for individuals. Price is worth it for the quality. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We tried Humble Pie for the first time and we were not disappointed. We had the burger, tempura green beans, calamari, and barbeque pizza. We came around 4pm on a Saturday and was surprised that the appetizers were happy hour prices. Our server, Paul was friendly and attentive. Excellent service! Glad to have purchased the Groupon for Humble Pie."}
{"text":"We decided to try the lunch special - a personal 10'' pizza with soup or salad.  Hubby got the Cesar salad, I chose the turkey chili.  Both were a supreme disappointment.  Who puts celery in Cesar salad?!  Apparently Humble Pie does.  And the turkey \"chili\" was anything but ... more like a Minestrone soup with globs of unpeeled grape tomatoes.  Yuck.  The saving grace here was definitely the pizza.  Brick oven cooked, the crust was perfection.  We both got the meat-lovers with red onion - - toppings were generous and the mozzarella was fresh. REALLY good pizza.  

Service was lacking ... it was a good 15 minutes before we were served our salad and \"chili\" and the pizza quickly followed about 5 minutes later.  We weren't provided with cheese or peppers (even though we asked) until we were halfway finished with the pizza.  There were only 3 other tables in the restaurant at the time with 2 servers, so the delay seemed unacceptable.  

If you go to Humble Pie, skip everything but the pizza.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Visited Humble Pie today with coworkers for lunch. We got there very early, as in right when they opened. And I highly suggest that to anyone else wanting to avoid the very big lunch crowd.
We all went with the lunch combo of pizza and salad- what a great deal and even better portions!
I had the veggie salad which was so good and the perfect amount of everything. Every bite was delish. Then I had the BLT pizza, also very good. When you first see that mayo is on a pizza you might think twice, however it went perfectly with the rest of the toppings. 
Due to the fact that we were on work hours, no adult beverages were purchased, however their happy hour drink menu starts at 11! That is great and it seemed like they had some good selections at good prices.
The service was normal, nothing extraordinary or bad about it. The waitress did not huff and puff over the fact that we all needed separate checks. Waters were filled appropriately. 
Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"We love, love love Humble Pie. The best Cheeseburger on delicious sourdough bread. Not counting calories here!!! We will be back."}
{"text":"I love their Express lunch. you get so much food for a good price."}
{"text":"Was supposed to have a business lunch here at 11 am on a Tuesday, which is when they advertise that they open.  Arrived slightly before 11, no signs of life. We waited until 11:10, doors still locked and chairs were stacked on tables, nobody inside. If you advertise that you open at 11..... well, open at 11. Otherwise change your hours."}
{"text":"It's been a long wait, but my wife and I, who live close by finally tried this place. When you first enter, it's smaller than one would have imagined, but it's slightly charming. I would say sort of a neighborhood bar vibe. There is a lot of outside seating by the way. 
The server was quick and friendly. To the food...I had their sausage pizza, with local sausage company Schriener's on the pie. I was excited to see that. My wife ordered the penne aka vodka. I must say the pizza is just, meh. It wasn't bad, but far from what I would come back for. The pasta, especially the sauce was bland and really lacked depth. It needed seasoning or something. That's another thing. No bread at the table, and no offer for fresh Parm on the pasta dish. Kind of sloppy for a bill that topped $45 including the tip. My wife and I agreed we will give it another shot, but it won't be first on our list."}
{"text":"Cool name...bad pizza.  Shockingly greasy and thin...and not in a good way.  Service is great and my wife's sandwich looked ok."}
{"text":"Had take out pizza a few weeks ago and it was pretty good. We live close so we decided to order again this past Sunday. The pizza was totally different and no better than one I could make at home for $5.00. total rip off.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good Pizza and great service!!
The date dinner for two special is great for its value, available on Thursdays after 6:00 pm!!!
 It included an entree, two salads and one pizza of your choice!!! 
Enough food for two!!! :) The garlic french fries were bomb!!!! Deliciously seasoned. As for our friend, the birthday boy, he had pepperoni pizza and that by itself was great, better than our BBQ Chicken pizza I would say!!
 Fun place, great service, AWESOME YOUNG MAN SERVING!!! :) We came here with a group of 12 and were seated urgently and smoothly!! :) Oh and the Pomegranate Martini was Oh soo Great!!! A must try, a bit strong, but that's how I like them!! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered one of their express lunches (served 11-3).  You have the choice between a 9\" pizza & soup or Salad, 1/2 a sandwich & soup or salad for under $10.  I ordered the S.O.P. pizza (Sausage, carmelized onion, roasted pepper and ricotta) which was very tasty although the middle pizza was a little soggy.  I didn't pull out my measuring tape but I'm sure the pizza was closer to 12\".  The 12\" version cost $14.50. You get to choose between the four salads they carry on the menu (all sounded great).  The chop salad had roasted turkey, salami, grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and a divine herb vinaigrette.  The small salad on the menu costs $7 so the $9.95 price tag on the pizza/salad combo was a great value.

Will definitely stop here again.

P.S.  Kids eat free on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, what a great place to eat! We made it in time for happy hour and were very impressed with the deals. Great selection of beer. The Iceberg Wedge was a terrific beginning. We followed it up with a 'happy hour' size Pepperoni , just the right size, and a regular size Margherita. Both were so tasty; I'm sure because of the brick oven and wood fire. Whole heartily recommend!"}
{"text":"I love their chopped salad so much. I will always get it every time i come. It's the perfect mix of meat, cheese, and the dressing is so flavorful. 
The first time I came to Humble Pie I got the fig and prosciutto pizza and didn't love it. It wasn't bad, just not my favorite. The second time I got the bbq chicken pizza and liked it better. You really need to like bbq to get this pizza as it is more bbq than your typical bbq chicken pizza. It still wasn't my favorite but it was better than my fig and prosciutto. I'll definitely be back for the chopped salad and to try another pizza in search of my favorite bc I know it's on the menu with all the choices available!"}
{"text":"I ordered a $17 pepperoni pizza. No crowd,  My flight boards soon, no real sense of urgency here. Zero line, no reason why it should take 25 minutes to get a mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"I hate to give 1 star to anyone but you be the judge. The server/waiter must have been forced to work  as he didn't smile at all during our entire meal. By far the worst service I've got in a very long time. After being seated on the patio the angry server showed up to take our drink order. We ordered 2 pizzas and appetizers. The pizzas were so good that we wanted to try an other one. I ordered a pizza with chicken on it. Bad choice. The chicken was passed its expiration  day and smelt rotten . My girlfriend took a bite not believing me and spit it right out. When the waiter made his rounds I flagged him and told him about the chicken. He rolled his eyes at us and left. I asked for the check and the pie with bad chicken was on it. I payed my bill and left.

Would have been a 4 star even with the bad service, but if you are going to serve me bad food and charge me for it then 1 star is all you get."}
{"text":"Here from out of town.  Stopped in - staff was welcoming and helpful. Both pizzas were so-so, outside of crust good, middle soggy/underdone.  It was interesting because due to reasons beyond my control, both pizzas were eaten separately and that was the reaction from both groups of eaters. Daughter liked the Mac-n-cheese. Positives: staff, Mac-and-cheese. Negatives: pizza taste, value for money spent. Overall, not a good value for what was received."}
{"text":"Wow, I really like Humble Pie. The thing is I've lived right around the corner from this restaurant for over 2 years now and have been there a couple times, but recently I came in with family and was shocked at home much I loved the food. Actually, it's kinda of funny story how we ended up reuniting with Humble Pie... we tried to take family to Tryst Cafe next door at 7pm and were told by someone on their waitstaff that they close at 8, so if we are going to take awhile, we should go somewhere else. WHAT?!?! Well of course we immediately left and went right next door to a more than happy to serve us Humble Pie. 

The pizza at Humble Pie is unique, but has such a good crust it's unbelievable. I just love the taste of that darn crust. They have good cheap wines, excellent salads, and tasty appetizers. Also, my Husband and I used to come here JUST to get an order of their cheesecake to go--- it's that GOOD. The last time we were here we have the pizza cookie and it also was amazing. 

All in all, we've been eating here a lot more frequently and I'm so happy we rediscovered it's goodness. Thanks to Humble Pie for accepting our business happily... unlike it's next door neighbor..."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. We were repeatedly ignored when we first walked in. It took 10 minutes to get a server and when as asked for extra plates and Parmesan for our pizza, the server just never came back. I have never written a negative review before so hopefully that says something. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered at \"the humble pie on the fly\" (their To Go section) and it took forever to get me my chicken sandwich and salad. The sandwich was over cooked and dry and the salad wasn't anything to write home about. Not to mention it's way too expensive."}
{"text":"I hate the lay out of the restaurants in Sky Harbor as there only a couple per terminal causing them to be quite busy with people who have time to kill, but this isn't Humble Pies fault. While we did have to wait a little bit the hostess tried to find us a table as quick add she could. 

The pizza was surprisingly good and surpassed our expectations for airport dining.  I had the pesto chicken and my wife had the sausage and peppers.  Ingredients were good and plentiful and my wife really liked the red sauce. 

It is over priced, but that's to be expected from an airport restaurant. We enjoyed the food enough that I think we might have to go the regular location in Scottsdale and try it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday evening and when we walked in, the hostess told us it would be about a 10 minute wait until a table would be open. 10 minutes sounded reasonable until we were waiting outside in the heat for over an hour. We saw so many other couples go in and get seated right away, and the couples that had to wait with us were brought water immediately and we did not even get offered water. After an hour of waiting the hostess said that it would be a little while longer... She didn't even offer water or outdoor seating. After speaking with another hostess, she apologized and said she would clear off a table outside as soon as she could. Another 20 minutes went by before we were seated and the food was not worth the wait.. My recommendation would be to make a reservation. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"So excited to try Humble Pie, but ultimately underwhelmed by the entire experience. The pizza was just average, which does not cut it with so many other fantastic pizza options in the area.

My husband and I started with the bruschetta. The serving size was pathetic-- two small slices, each cut in half. We then ordered the Chicken Pesto pizza. We had originally wanted to do half Pear Gorgonzola and half Chicken Pesto, but we were told they don't do split pizzas. We were a little thrown off by this, as splitting pizzas is a common practice at most places. The Chicken Pesto itself was unimpressive.

After the pizza, we were still not satisfied, so we ordered a side of garlic fries. The garlic fries were delicious... probably the best thing we had there, which is pretty sad for a pizza place.

But, what really turned the whole experience sour was our server's refusal to honor a coupon we had. We had received a coupon for a free pizza with the purchase of $20 worth of food and drink. We spent well  over this! However, since we were dining with our friends who also had this coupon, they refused to take it. We each met the minimum separately and had separate bills. It made no sense that by the mere pushing together of two tables, the coupon was null. 

This was very upsetting as the server knew all along that we had the coupons and never mentioned this catch. It said nothing of it on the coupon itself either. We would have been more than happy to make up for the discount with a generous tip and perhaps a return visit. But the service was the nail in the coffin for us at Humble Pie."}
{"text":"All I am going to say is I came here with some friends after a hot golf session, and their Happy Hour on food and drinks from 11 am - 6 pm is a good deal!  You can't beat a decent sized flavorful pizza and salad for $10.  I will come back again for this awesome happy hour deal!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This pizza is fantastic!  The crust is off the hook.  As a pizza snob; I don't often give 5 stars to most places I try, but this one deserves it."}
{"text":"A fan of their food but their service is very lacking. Stopped in while in Phoenix to visit my family to use a coupon I had. We were seated right away & server came over to get our drinks right away but service fell after that. I asked about our coupon & the waiter mentioned that he'd probably forget about it so he'd take it right away. Fine to take it right away but why say that to customers? Ordered the Garlic French Fries as an appetizer which were very good. Large portion for the 3 of us. Server never gave us napkins, utensils or plates to put our fries on. Had to ask the server to bring them. Ordered the Shrimp Pizza. Very disappointed in it as for the flavor. Shrimp were fresh but it was just shrimp on a pizza with a ton of red chili dumped on the pizza. There were no other seasoning to it at all. It was too spicy & took away from the flavor of the shrimp. Had to ask the server for the Parmesan cheese & other toppings as we didn't have any on our table (had already eaten 1/2 of the pizza before we realized we didn't have them) but there was a large tray of them on one of the tables as they were clearing other tables. Overall I would try the place again as the fries were awesome. Many other pizza's that would be worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is in the neighborhood we moved into a few months ago and when we saw the groupon we figured why not?! Just tried to go for an early dinner and what a bust. Yes it was busy due to kids eat free however it was easy to see what is wrong with this place. The host misquoted a wait time (10 mins) as we sat there for 20 minutes we literally saw 4 open tables that servers/bussers/the host just kept walking by and not picking up dirty dishes or cleaning those tables. The servers that couldn't bother to help bus their tables so they could turn them had no problem picking up their check presenters btw. The host also had more than enough time to bs with one of his buddies. \"We're busy as shit wanna help?\" Needless to say we left and grabbed a pizza at Papa Murphys instead and subsequently cancelled our Groupon. Such a disappointment on so many levels."}
{"text":"Our first time there...  The food was great.  The service was \"eh\"...  We were there with 4 adults and 5 kids.  The 4 adults and the 2 kids who ordered pizza got their food a full 15 minutes before the 3 kids who had ordered something else.  Anyone who has EVER dined with kids knows that this is not a great scenario...

I'd likely try it again, but if I had a similar experience, I'd probably skip it going forward..."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus! How did these People find their way to the Airport. My order was taken while 3 women leaned on a counter talking... eventually one woman made a few crusts then they ALL left even the cashier. After 15 minutes the women came back to continue talking. When I asked about the pizza one woman said, \"what chu order?\" Then she said \"that ain't gonna happen, we outta pesto sauce\". I asked what was cooking in the oven and she said, \"Nothing ... we got some already made but they ain't got pesto... you want one of them?\" I said \"No\" and she \"well.... I don't know what to tell you!\" After 35 mins of waiting a manager
Arrived and said \"oh, did we lose another one?\" Watch the video I posted . How do they pay the rent 'cause they sure aren't selling pizza. These are the people celebrities create telethons and ribbons for out of hope for a cure. You can't cure this! Video will be posted on YouTube... this app won't allow it"}
{"text":"An excellent brick oven pizza. The \"side\" salad is HUGE with a wonderful Caesar dressing to it. There were a LOT of staff - seemingly too many... I'd go back, but not necessarily go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Ethan provided terrific service. He anticipated our needs, offered high enthusiasm and was very thoughtful in's the service he provided. I would recommend this to a friend and look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner here. The food was delicious, but more importantly, the service was outstanding. Todd, one of the managers, took care of us, and his service was so exemplary, I was, at first, convinced that he was the owner. If you eat here and have him as your server, consider yourself lucky. As far as the food, I had the Mac & Cheese which was very good. It's a heavy dish, but the pancetta was crispy, and it was super cheesy. My sister had the chicken pesto pizza, which she has had before. She loves it. She also started with the caprese salad. The burrata was yum. I started with 2 of the bruschetta - the apple and the fig/prosciutto. They were both super tasty. It's hard to go wrong with bread and cheese, and Humble Pie got it all right. This place is a carb lovers heaven. Todd made the experience top notch. His customer service just put it over the top!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess was so rude I almost walked away. Very glad I didn't!!! Outstanding pizza, beer and service. My water was never empty - Katie is a great waitress!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Was greeted and seated right away. Appetizers were awesome..I had the meatballs. I recommend everyone try these! The pizza didn't take too long to come out and it was good also. The prices were fair, the place was kind of dark, could use more lighting. They say us in the back.. I don't recommend to sit there, it's hot from the pizza oven. I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"We had the meatball pizza and it was incredible. Chopped salad was delicious as well. Waitstaff was super friendly. We stumbled upon this place on a Friday evening- so glad we did. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other day because the sports bar near it was full and had an indefinite wait. They said they'd play the game we wanted to see and had a few TVs plus it was after lunch and before dinner so it wasn't crowded at all. I was having trouble deciding on a pizza or salad so when my friend ordered a pizza and they asked if she wanted the 12 inch or the 9 inch with a salad (lunch special) my little dilemma was solved (first world problems over here). I really liked the veggie salad and margarita pizza I got. Their happy hour was good too... $2.50 drafts! We had already been seated and gotten drinks before they told us they wouldn't be playing the game we wanted to see though... they don't have the NFL ticket."}
{"text":"good pizza in an airport?  really? REALLY?

i got the sausage which apparently they are known for.  The service was super perky and peppy, my beer was cold and large and even though the pizza took a little bit of time - it was quite good.  I was pretty hungry on the plain, digging the flavor but I still ended up taking a couple of slices home.

It might not be high on the value list but I was on expense account and it beat anything else i have ever eaten for pizza in an airport."}
{"text":"Dropped in a couple of nights ago for a pizza, salad and a couple of drinks.  We generally like this restaurant group, but this store needs attention.  Hostess was indifferent, but waiter was polite.  Salad was boring and hastily assembled.  The calamari was more like pork rinds, not good.  Pizza was missing ingredients.  $80 later we left without a thank you.  Owners need to pay a visit."}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place.......

Took my kids to the aquarium and they wanted pizza afterwards.  I figured humble pie can't be that bad. 

There was no one in the restaurant so I thought hey at least it will be fast service. Boy was I wrong about this place. If I could give it negative stars I would. 

Upon walking in we waited almost 7 minutes to be seated. Mind you there is no one in this place besides one guy at the bar getting drunk.  It's 11 am. Later I found out he was an employee. Likely on his off day and was so obnoxious talking to the other staff about a party they were to attend that evening.  

The host didn't seat us until the cook behind the counter called out to someone. 

One thing that was decent is that we did end up getting the food pretty quickly. Quality however was horrible.  

Needless to say if this place doesn't change some things around I doubt it will make it another six months."}
{"text":"I love pizza like I have said in many other posts.  
I met a good friend here for lunch.  We ordered the pretzel and it was good.  I ordered the lunch special which includes a pizza and salad.  I got the pepperoni pizza and minestrone soup.  The pizza was really good.  I like the way they cook it here with their oven.  It was good.  I have thought about building one of these ovens in my backyard but think nope.  To unhealthy.
Pizza varies all over the place.  This place is thin crust that is cooked in a wood fired stove."}
{"text":"This is a great, casual pizza place.

Thursday nights they have an amazing date night special.

Their pizzas are good.  I had the BBQ Chicken and it has a nice little kick.

My fiance had a pasta and we weren't as impressed with that.

For what it is, it's great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm updating this again?!?  Maybe I am crazy.  Crazy in love, that is!  Yesterday, I skipped lunch and decided to drop in to try the new summer salad on the menu: strawberries and Gorgonzola.  It was delicious, and very good-sized.  I would have shared the 1/2 salad if I had been planning on ordering a pizza later.  The really great part, though, came when I got the bill.  The salad is 5.95 normally, but it's discounted (25%, along with all the rest of the food on the menu) during happy hour (3-6 Mon-Fri).  I left a ten dollar bill for the salad and an ice cold Stella w/ tax and tip.  I sat at the bar and had no problems with service, of course it wasn't very full at 4:30 in the afternoon.  Anyway I don't think this place deserves the hate.  Check it out and eat the pepperoni; it's the best."}
{"text":"Don't want to say too many things positive as I don't want it to get too crowded.  Great pizza and salads. Very neighborly! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews on airport food joints, but I did this time solely on the fact that during a rather lengthy lay-over, humble pie made my day. As with most airport food joints the humble pie was unassuming and I wasn't expecting much from a weary staff and over worked kitchen, but was in for a surprise. The restaurant itself was clean and was not the madhouse I would have expected. 
     Our waitress Carol was an energetic and friendly face for a weary traveller to look upon. She was patient and understanding. She had our drinks ordered and at our table quickly and took our order for food in a timely manner. The food was delicious and it was fresh. I had. BLT sandwich and fries. The BLT was tasty (the bacon was crispy) and the shoestring fries were very good! I highly recommend this stop if your on a layover at Sky harbor airport in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I like this place the ladies behind the bar are really helpful.  The food is really good and it's a nice place to sit and wait for a flight.  The only reason I give it three stars is cause the manager is a asshole.  He put his hands in the air and told a customer to move out of his way, when the customer was moving out of the way for someone else.  I told him to relax and he just blew me off.  I could hear him being a ass behind the bar too and talking shit.  He needs to be fired cause he is bringing down a good place. His name is Juan!"}
{"text":"went right when they opened. the lunch special was good, had the strawberry gorgonzola salad and meat lovers pizza.. sausage on the pie was kind of meal-y.. they should  change it. salad was excellent. the star was the pretzel appetizer.. good size, smoky from the wood oven, but the spicy/sweet mustard was AWESOME ! just enough horseradish ta clear ya out. Service was very good. Pizza was average. I'd go again, but order something without the sausage."}
{"text":"Food on the decline, over priced, now service maybe the worse I've ever had. They're clueless here. Owner needs to take a long hard look. We live close and won't be back."}
{"text":"After walking around the aquarium, thought this would be a great place to take the kids to eat. Pizza was OK. Crust was somewhat doughy in the middle and the edges were kind of burnt. One was charred black. Toppings were good but VERY stingy with cheese, which seemed to melt and center in the middle of the pizza. Needed more napkins and had to get them ourselves since the server was so inattentive. Took forever for drink refills. The server checked on us about 5 minutes before we left and that was to get us refills, that we had to ask for, and bring the check. It was not busy. Maybe 3-4 tables and 3 servers.for $15 per pizza, which is equivalent to a very small pizza, I would say to exit these grounds at the aquarium and go to a cheaper, tastier pizza place..."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend last night to cap off the holiday week.  I've somehow managed to overlook this joint so was excited to try it....we met at 6 and took a seat at the bar.  We started off with some fabulous pink lemondrops and some hummus.  The drinks were very tasty and we polished them off in record time, then decided to order more drinks and food.   We ordered: olives, baked raviolis, a wedge salad for me, and bruschetta for my buddy.  The salad was yummy; I was craving something light after the holiday and it really hit the spot!  The olives were delicious as well.  I wasn't as thrilled with the ravioli....it was bl and needed more spice and texture, in my opinion.  There were tons of people taking pizzas to go so I plan on trying some next time.  Overall, my experience was positive,....the place is cute, the staff is attentive, and the natives are friendly.  I will most definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes the hype is worth listening to and Humble Pie lives up to the hype.  It is so friggin good I thought about joining a gym just so I can justify eating here, all the time.

I had the fig and prosciutto and goat cheese pie, the bf had the fungi pie. Awesome. The service was amazing, the portion sizes were really good (not too big) and the ingredients and taste and combinations of the food was impeccable. Seriously gonna be the go to spot."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for a quick bite to eat and left happy. Their Caesar salad and butternut squash soup are both quite tasty, we also ordered the French fries and a margherita pizza. The French fries were massive and tasty, the pizza was perfectly cooked and very clean tasting. I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I practically live here, it's so good. .-. I've brought all my friends and family members here and now they come all the time too! Their pizzas are no doubt the best in Phoenix, plus they have a local vegetarian pizza too which is a bonus if you really want to support local business!
The owner and the staff are some of the nicest people to work in food service as well. They're very friendly, attentive, and attitude-free (a quality rarely seen in the food industry). Plus, the location is great! It's within walking distance of my house and is also very close to downtown, so you can go there after 1st or 3rd Friday.
They also have specials everyday which is a big motivator to eat there frequently. I give Humble Pie a ten-outta-ten, would eat again."}
{"text":"Hint:  tell your hostess who is either really tired or overtly stoned that it is not cool to:  kiss on your boyfriend while working, ignoring customers, or looking at them yawning, then asking if they wanted a seat.  Such behavior really doesn't  reflect well to weary travelers.  Sky Harbor really has come a ling way with adding awesome restaurants, but might benefit from not overworking and/or hiring such staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many-a-times.  For starters the wedge salad and calamari are both great.  The wedge has a great mix of onions and cherry tomatoes on top...the blue cheese dressing that comes on it is delicious, but if you're looking for a more healthier option the vinaigrette-caper dressing is tasty as well.  The calamari is the traditional deep fried calamari...pretty standard, but delicious.

On to the pizzas.  One person can definitely eat one of the pizzas, but they are shareable if you're not into eating that much.  The crust is really what makes these pizzas good.  It kinda has this sourdough taste, but its crispy and just chewy enough where you aren't giving your jaw a workout.  My favorite pizza by far is the chicken pesto.  Its served with grilled cherry tomatoes and these phenom crunchy, crispy, salty onion strips on top.  The onion strips are the best.  The cheese and pepperoni pizzas are pretty standard, but tasty.  I've also tried their sausage pizza.  If you're into sausage, then this is for you...I think there are like three different types of sausages on top...pretty spicy and a real good taste.  My mom always has the pistachio pizza and onion pizza...not my thing however she does get it every time we go there.

All and all a great place.  Pretty good atmosphere as well.  They have a few tvs hanging in the restaurant.  Not the best place to catch a game, but the bar wouldn't be that bad of a place to sit and watch a game.  I've also heard they have a bomb cookie dessert pizza...sooo umami."}
{"text":"We give this three stars, but really it's just \"OK\" not \"A-OK\"...yes, there's a diff...service was friendly and prompt and we liked the atmosphere, but since we're mostly there for the food and drink, we wouldn't go back. The BBQ chicken pizza was good, but not the best we've had and the artichoke pizza had more olives than artichokes. Also, I'm not one to want super-alcoholy cocktails, but even I thought the Humble Cosmo was a little light on the vodka. So, Lamp Pizzaria up north is still the champ!"}
{"text":"Good experience here. The food was delicious and though our server said the kitchen was pretty busy, the food came faster than expected. We came with a Groupon, but our family of 4 had a $51 bill. Not cheap, but not top of the heap. 

Long and short of it is, good atmosphere, good with kids, worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service. Ordered meat lovers and pepperoni pizzas, salads, and a grilled chicken sandwich. Food was good."}
{"text":"Delicious wood fired pizza. The crust is light and crunchy and the cheese is gooey and bubbly. I like the margarita pizza, sausage pizza, and the house made farmers cheese with heirloom tomatoes."}
{"text":"This gourmet pizza joint is on par with Patsy Grimaldi's, i.e. a close second place to Pizzeria Bianco. How do you beat the national favorite? You dont.  But that is still a HUGE compliment, as even a close comparison with PB is an honor, in my book. And, Humple pie is biting at the heels of Bianco, no doubt. I work close by, so maybe I'm partial but the pizza is fantastic. They have great variety and do all kinds well. Try the Margharita or Artichoke pizzas. The artichokes on the artichoke pizzas are huge chunks - no skimping here!
The lunch special and happy hour prices are both good deals. I ordered the cold Green Bean salad at happy hour ($3 i believe) and it was surprisingly delightful and refreshing. Puts a new perspective on \"salad.\"
Also, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful- even when slammed with the lunch crowd. Have yet to have a bad experience here!
I highly recommend it for a nice light lunch or dinner. Its yummy!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza; management is subpar. When a customer receives a burned, poorly constructed pizza and asks for another...management's response shouldn't be excuses."}
{"text":"If you want a wildly overpriced pizza experience, this is your spot.  The veggie salad was decent, but the pizza had a disproportionate crust to toppings ratio.  The service was probably understaffed for a Saturday night, and it didn't help their cause.  There are too many good pizza places in Phoenix for this to match the competition."}
{"text":"Dig this place. I only go for happy hour, which is great since it's 7 days a week, and its one of the best deals near Arrowhead. Cheap Four Peaks and pizza. Solid deal around these parts. Goes great with catching a buzz before hitting Harkins across the street for a double feature. 

Pizza is pretty good. Crust is fairly thin (the way it should be), not overly chewy and the cheese and sauce are of decent quality. I've had better, but have had way more worse. It's 7.5/10.

Restaurant itself is nice. Good service, especially at the bar. Very relaxed atmosphere. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My third time here and all kept getting more disappointing than the previous. The pizza has a rock-hard crust. First visit I had the roasted mushroom pizza. I really don't want al dente fungus on a pizza. Second visit I had the Mac n Cheese. You have to step your game up for Mac n Cheese in this neighborhood. I guess if you like really salty Mac n Cheese, this is your place. Third visit, the egg pizza. Seriously, after being open for a couple months, have your oven dialed in so not to dislocate your jaw trying to eat the crust. Total disappointment for a needed neighborhood pizza joint. They do have good beer prices for happy hour. That's a positive."}
{"text":"We've only been here for lunch on numerous occasions (great lunch special).  Pizza has always been good and their chopped salad is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because they were open late when our flight was delayed.  Otherwise this place is overpriced and not good.  I ordered a pizza with prosciutto and got Canadian bacon instead.  Paid $19 for the pizza which is personal sized, and $10 a beer.  Would not come here again."}
{"text":"I can't speak to their pizzas, but the salads are decent to average for the pre-packed airport variety. The chopped salad in particular is a good portion for ~$10, fresh and with a lot of chicken and salami. I did not care for the actual taste of the salami, which seemed a bit funky. I picked it off. They also offer an extremely-average caesar.

 My main complaint about this spot is their slow service: I understand a pizza would take a while to get, even in a quick-burn oven, but the woman at the register was making excessive conversation as a line got larger and larger. 

TIP: as of mid-October, the area directly in front of this restaurant is undergoing flooring construction, so foot traffic really bottlenecks up right here, making the line look even longer than it is."}
{"text":"This was a place I wanted to like, but fell short. It was a busy night to their credit, but not impressive. A bit cramped, no personality on the waitress and the food was okay.

I get it, with the trend of all the \"Artisan\" pizza places opening up, the ingredient were fresh, but I think the atmosphere killed it for me. The \"Cheese Bread\" is nothing more than a cheese pizza and the actual pizza I ordered I did not like at all.

I was given the opportunity to order something else from the menu, but assumed that I would be paying for both items since a substitution was not offered for my disliking the first dish. I understand, I did order it so I suppose that my fault, but now I know."}
{"text":"2 stars because they gave me a free water!!! I had the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was very bland and didn't have much cheese at all. The worst part about the experience was the fact it was $13.95 for a 9\" pepperoni pizza. After taxes it was $15. You definitely don't get what you paid for. If you ignore this and still eat here, at least get the cheese pizza, you won't feel so jipped after you eat it because it's only $10."}
{"text":"The newest pizza place in North-Central Phoenix opened shortly before Christmas 2008. Located just west of Desert Ridge Marketplace on the west side of Tatum. Menu essentially the same as the Scottsdale location. Otherwise same excellent pizza, service, atmosphere. Parking could be a problem at times. 
Fresh local ingredients, fast service, and family atmosphere are the hallmarks of Humble Pie. Crust is thick at the edges, thin in the center. As a former Chicagoan the adjustment to thin crust was much easier with this quality dining spot. Love their salads too.
 I recommend the pepperoni pizza because it is not topped with conflicting flavors. The Sausage and Fennel would be much better without the fennel. I realize American tastes have moved towards \"scented\" and \"sweeter\", but I have not. So don't be afraid to ask if the pizza you will be ordering has any non-traditional flavors. Would you order a Super Supreme Pizza Hut pizza and sprinkle mint or lavender on it? At this place they would, so beware before you order.  Plan to order 1 pizza per adult. If you order carry-out, it only takes about 12 minutes to make a to-go pizza.
My only actual complaint about H.P. is the cramped dining area. And when the booze is flowing heavy the place gets loud.

Wording on the menu can be a bit confusing... you can add ingredients (pizza toppings) but you cannot substitute. You should research the menu online before going here. And their Sunday closing time online is not correct, so if you're going late - call first.

Update: From the time I originally wrote this review to today in 2013 they are up to 5 locations with more coming. I think one is planned this year at Skyharbor. This chain is locally owned."}
{"text":"Really yummy pizza and sandwiches. Kids eat free on Sunday. If you order salad, ask for the dressing on the side as they tend to drown your salad in dressing sometimes. Fries are delicious here and the atmosphere is inviting and friendly. Never had any issues with the wait staff even when they were very busy."}
{"text":"My friend and I met there for lunch. Service was fair, no one asked us how our food was, my hamburger and my friends meatball sandwich had virtually no flavor in the meat. I have had the pizzas before and they are generally pretty good, but I didn't want pizza. Servers looked rushed and were not personable at all"}
{"text":"This place is really excellent. It's tough to beat their lunch specials. You can get a pizza and a salad for 10 bucks. The veggie salad is my favorite along with the pepperoni pizza. The amazing thing is that kids eat for free during the summer months.

The food is always excellent fresh with wonderful flavor. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second time ordering from Humble Pie. The first time was a few months ago & it was amazing, we loved it. Our order tonight was such a disappointment. The crust was overdone & had no flavor, the cheese and sauce were so light.....a completely different experience than we had before. Im not sure if they have new management or what but tonight was a big bummer :("}
{"text":"Tight and cramped tables so close together that you can touch your neighbor! Pizzas are terrific along with some great deals for happy hour.
If you can sit at the bar...do it! Nice local place but it really needs more space to accommodate patrons comfortably..."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp and thought it sounded pretty good. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and the mac and cheese, and liked both quite a bit. He really liked the crust on the pizza and I did too. Only negative was no substitutions on the pizzas they have listed - would have ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza if I could have removed the onions."}
{"text":"I love the Humble Pie on 7th Street.  Great staff who always remember us and are very nice and attentive.  The food is always good.  One of my favorites is the burger.  I know the is strange since you wouldn't think of Humble Pie for their burgers but they are fantastic!  Also love the tempura green beans and the veggie salad!  Drinks are great too.  My favorite is the Pomegranite Martini which I have to limit to one per visit!  They have a great happy hour and a super relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The egg pizza is the bomb!!  Also, awesome garlic fries and a great chopped salad.  Everyone we recommended the egg pizza to loved it!!"}
{"text":"Our first time last night. Great crust but we put too many toppings and it made it hard to eat! Pie was delicious though. I agree with others that our waitress didn't have a great personality but the guy serving others seemed very friendly. Was able to sit outside which was a bonus."}
{"text":"I was here on Friday night with a friend. The pepperoni pizza was prepared perfectly and the wine was priced well. Our waitress was attentive and was pleasant, not pushy and didn't interrupt us. There was no wait so we got right in. I will go back."}
{"text":"Very good, small pizza shop in Scottsdale. The fired oven flavor is very good. 

Their salads are good as well. Misters on the patio are a nice touch."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a drink to kill time after my flight was delayed.

Both servers I had were great. Attentive, pleasant and helpful.

Their good service turned a three hour flight delay into an opportunity to relax with a beer and a cup of tea.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great place with Great people and amazing food. Try the mushroom pizza. Wine, pizza and Great atmosphere. What a Great place to share with friends."}
{"text":"First of all I had the crispy fries, calamari, fig and procuttio pizza, and doughnut holes. I think all of their food is great MINUS their pizza. Ive been here a few times and i enjoyed everything else, but the pizza. I would definitely recommend the crispy calamari and the fries. Worth it."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Humble for several years & have yet to be disappointed.  I love sitting at the high tops near the bar & letting the atmosphere sink in & relax me.  I haven't eaten outside on the patio due to the proximity to 7th St & all of its traffic.  I can visualize a quite, landscaped patio behind the restaurant, but then where would we park?  LOL!  That aside, I've enjoyed every meal I have eaten there - lunch, happy hour & dinner (plus pick-up!).  I live close enough to walk to Humble Pie & it has become a favorite hang in the 'hood!  The service is attentive, friendly & professional.  I'm looking forward to my next visit there - which will be in 2 days for lunch  Yum"}
{"text":"I'm on minute 25 and still no pizza. People here are very nice but poorly trained by corporate. If you put in a restaurant inside of an airport it should not take 25 minutes to get your food. People here are stressed out and need to eat quickly and make their flight."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! This place definitely makes a long flight delay more bearable. We love the pizza and the meatball appetizer. Sit at the full service bar and let Floyd take care of you. He's attentive and professional!"}
{"text":"They do have good food! I love the sandwiches but a couple time I have received salads and the salad itself is slime and wilted. The last salad I had the tomato was rotten. I do like the food just make sure you look at what you are eating."}
{"text":"too expensive! We paid $50 for 2 personal size pizzas fries and a beer. forget it! Food was okkk

save your money and go to grimaldis"}
{"text":"I fly in and out of Sky Harbor quite often and am surprised that the bars in Terminal D don't offer options of local beers.  Since I had a delay this last flight, I decided to explore to see if I could find something.  Just one terminal over - Terminal C, not E ;), I found Humble Pie.  I thought it was a local Phoenix eatery, so glanced at their bar.  Still, not many options but saw a Kilt Lifter and I was sold.  The place was packed (it is really small), no room at the bar, so they sat me behind a wall.  I was forgotten for about 15 minutes, but finally the waitress came over to take my order.  I sat, savoring my beverages for about an hour, with no rush from the waitress other than bringing my bill out as soon as she brought my order (so helpful in an airport establishment) and a few check-ins to see if I wanted anything else.  

Sorry, I can't speak to the food since I didn't order any, but the beer was good."}
{"text":"I went here with my dad and a friend of his. I got the sourdough burger medium rare with avocado and a side of cottage cheese. The burger tasted good with the avocado. The burger is kind of unique because it is served on toasted bread instead of a bun. The service was good. Next time I might try the pizzas for something different."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but honestly feels like your a burden to the staff. Drinks were empty the entire meal. Had to flag server down for service."}
{"text":"Wow!  We were changing planes with a short layover in Phoenix and came across this newly opened place in Terminal C (Southwest) and decided to give it a try.  We both had the Sourdough burger.  Absolutely wonderful!  Nice thick juicy burger, thick grilled sourdough bread with grilled onions.  I had the salad with it - plenty of food!  Super fresh and delicious.  Prices weren't bad at all compared to the stuff you get at the airport.  Service was beyond excellent.  Pleasantly served and kept checking on us to see if there was anything else we needed.  Will definitely go back if we go through that way again - no hesitation!"}
{"text":"The very best pizza E V E R and I wish it would come to California .   Gunner waited on us and he's so cute , efficient and knows his stuff.  Helped us with our selection of pizza and was spot on.   We always find a Humble Pie when visiting the Phoenix area.   Love, Love, Love"}
{"text":"I went to Humble Pie on the night of 11/10/17 with 4 in our party. Our server was energetic and attentive. He really knows what is in the menu.  I ordered pizza for dine in and to go.  Everything was good.  I wish there was one in the Chandler Gilbert area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is simple and so good. My favorite has got to be the sausage and fennel pizza. Just about everything I have tried was amazing, with the pear and arugula pie being the only exception. We are still driving out to this location after we moved to Phoenix, and are looking forward to trying the location close to us."}
{"text":"I really, really loved Humble Pie. They make the kind of pizza that Sauce aspires to in it's deepest fantasies. 

Seriously - We split two: Artichoke and Potato. they were SO. GOOD. Just what I want from a pizza - wood fired, creamy, crusty, yummy. 

We also split some fries... Get these. Just do it. 

The service was decent, but we went at a weird time - there was hardly anyone there. 

Humble Pie: Please open a location downtown."}
{"text":"Nice stop to relax during  a delayed flight. There are lots of different kinds of pizza. They're decent, not the best I've ever had. Airport pricing of course."}
{"text":"Airport food. Not all food or service is created equal. I sat at the bar here recently and it was a good experience. The place was pretty busy but I was flying solo and was able to find the only open seat at the bar. The pizza was good, not great, but in no was was it gross or bad. Just a good pizza. The service was super friendly and very prompt. I will eat here again next time I am in Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Humble Pie for the last five years. Over time the quality has continued to diminish. Our last experience was pretty rough. We had a server with a snarky attitude and both of our pizza's looked horrible when they came out. The pizzas looked like the maker took handfuls of topping and just throw them on the pizza in a big pile. We sent one of the pizza's back where the server agreed about how the pizza was poorly put together, but was not happy to go to the kitchen. Unfortunately, the quality control seems to be missing from this restaurant. Hopefully they can turn things around as Humble Pie use to be a good pizza place"}
{"text":"Meh. Tuesday night. Expectations were high. Heard good things. Located in Scottsdale. Pizza was good, but super small. My son did not like the pizza sauce as it was too sweet for him. Caesar salad had celery in it. Weird. Pizza cookie was the highlight and was about as big (small) as the pizza. Customer service was marginal. They could make this place amazing. It has potential. Maybe just not on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"SALT!  This place needs to add some salt to their ingredients.  My hubby and I split an artichoke and a cheese pizza and both were severely lacking in flavor.  I thought the cheese was better than the artichoke but at $10+ per pizza, I was expecting more.  I know it's airport food, but it didn't inspire me to visit the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I never get angry when I go to a restaurant. I just don't like the pizza. But Oscar sitting next to me really likes the pizza. So you decide."}
{"text":"Finally made it to humble pie.  We ordered a large strawberry and gorgonzola salad, a s.l.o. pizza and a margherita pizza with pepperoni added.  

The salad was wilted and not fresh.  The strawberries were soft and also not fresh nor cut fresh.  The s.l.o. pizza was sweet and not appetizing.  All we could taste was sweet.  Sweet sausage, sweet onions, sweet red peppers.  No balance or any ther flavor came thru the sweetness.  The marg was the best thing out of the bunch.  The three dollar extra pepperoni was well worth it.  

If you are going to charge 13 dollars for a salad it better be fresh and chopped per order.  Lord knows this one wasn't.  The pizza crust was slightly charred but boring.  The sauce was also very mediocre.  Lets put it this way after a slice of each we had to order ranch to continue.  No self respecting pizza worth its weight should ever need ranch.  This place could be great.  Popular artisan pizza attempt, great location, decent waitress, but the food was just poorly executed and lazily put together.  We questioned if it would have been better to go to peter piper.  Not that we go there for pizza but that was the level it was on.  Best of luck and hopefully they can adjust before its too late.  I would not recommend this place nor would I come back."}
{"text":"Good bbq pizza. But what great about this place is their happy hour. Great prices on drinks and apps. The pretzel is to die for."}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU HUMBLE PIE!!! I order this to go about once per week. I call before I leave the office and it is ready to go in 10 minutes. It's tastier and faster than any delivery pizza you can get...unless you are hung over on a Sunday and cant bare to drive to pick it up. ;) 

I just tried the wings last week and will get the extra spicy next time but even once i brought them home they were still crispy and tender. noms! 

Pepperoni pizza, I love you. Small gourmet little slices of meat love. My bf gets the clam pizza...never had a bite but he loves it! I just cant seem to get away from what a normal pizza should be. 

The crust of the pizza is killer, chewy and fluffy. Amazing wood fired taste to it as well. 

This place is always packed during dinner hours but dies down around 8pm or so. Looks like a really fun place to go for mingling in the busy hours. After 9-10 hours of work, I am done talking to people and prefer pizza time with cats and bf."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and it's entirely because of Alex, the super-friendly bartender.  This guy always has a smile, a quick joke, and ridiculously contagious laughter, not to mention the best service I've ever gotten from a bartender.  He always remembers my drink!  The guy will see me walking across the parking lot and have my beer poured and waiting for me as I walk in the door. He is why I keep coming back.  

Although this is a restaurant, primarily the bar is what's up -- a local hangout with a sense of camaraderie unparalleled.  I've never met so many friendly, chatty people at a bar before.  The happy hour specials are score (Kiltlifter and Guiness on tap for $2.50 a pint?!), and if you're looking for some snacks to back that liquor then go for the uber-garlicky fries, the tempura green beans, or the good ol' fashioned pepperoni pizza.

Humble Pie Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Holy freaking french fries.   Best fries in Valley.   Garlic, cheese, a little heat.  Seriously good stuff.   Get there for happy hour, fries are half price. pizza is ok.  Crust is the best part.   Mac and cheese is thick rich and cheesy.  Fries are the star of the menu.  Beer and happy hour fruits are too legit to pass up.  Everything else is meh."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch.... Great service and excellent shrimp pizza.  Will come back here for sure!
Cindy"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza! Every single one I've tried has been spectacular but my alltime favorite is currently the egg topped option. We like to get a pizza, a side salad (the strawberry salad is fabulous) along with the mac and cheese. Perfection. The casual atmosphere, excellent staff and yummy food make this a regular haunt for us."}
{"text":"Visited this location at the Sky Harbor Airport terminal four on my way out of town. It was cool to get beer and pizza early in the morning to start a trip off right. Our server was attentive and she tried hard admitting many mistakes she made. I order my pizza without a topping listed in the description. My first pizza came with the topping I didn't want. No big deal......at first. They made the pizza again without question. However, it took twice as long and came out burnt! I couldn't enjoy it because I was now running late for my plane. So two pieces down of the 15.00 personal pizza and I had to run. It wasn't good enough to take with me and if I wanted a pizza to go I wouldn't have sat down at Humble Pie. So as I pay my bill I see it is full price...... Oh well, maybe I hit them on a bad day. That's why the ratings are on an average basis."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here on a Friday night at 8pm. It was pretty dead. The wait to get a table was nonexistent. That's cool!

Our server was friendly. She attended to all of our needs and answered any questions we had. 

Me and my friend ordered one white wine sangria, one glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, one Mac and cheese, one small Caesar salad, and one meat lovers pizza. This all cost $56. The quality- just fine. It wasn't anything too special though. The salad was fresh and crunchy. The pizza tasted a little burnt and flavorless. I don't feel like it was worth that much money.

I think humble pie had potential. They should just make their pizza better by adding more flavor and having fresher meats on there.

That is all!"}
{"text":"Today my staff wanted to do the \"Express Lunch\" so we went there and had the slowest service ever. The waiter took orders of people who came in after us, and was nowhere to be found most of the meal. I finally got up to ask about when our food would come out (we'd waited 20 minutes after finally getting to order), only to be told by the blonde woman working there that they had a new kitchen person so they were backed up. I brought the drinks for refills to the bar (which finally prompted the staff to come back to our table). We couldn't eat more than a soup/salad since we were so late, and we had to keep asking for boxes and our checks. It still took another 15 minutes to get out of there. I feel bad for the waiter, he seemed new and confused and wasn't getting much help. No offer of discounts (except for one of my team because they made his sandwich incorrectly). Don't bother going to this one."}
{"text":"Pizzas are a little small and pricey. They're OK for being in the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place.  1 star for having Four Peaks on tap and another star for the service.  Food was disappointing to say the least.  I originally ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were mushy with no flavor, pasta was over cooked, and the tomato sauce tasted like paste.  No seasoning.  I sent it back and got the sausage sandwich.  It was good, but oddly on one side of the sandwich the sausage was cold and the rest was hot.  French fries were good.  Wife had margarita pizza which had the same lack of flavor and pasty sauce.  Our server was good quickly replaced my meal was apologetic and provided good service.  Highly unlikely I will return-Sauce is 10 min further and 10x better."}
{"text":"As good as it looks! We always ask for an extra crispy bottom! Wood fired and delicious pizza! We have never had a bad experience here and 11-3 lunch is such a good deal! You get a whole personal pizza and soup or salad or you can get a sandwich with either a salad or soup. And they have a soup and salad special. The patio is awesome, service is always great! This is a great spot! Shown below- tempura green beans, and the SOP"}
{"text":"This place is great! We are new to the area and stumbled upon it one Sunday.  Just so happens, kids eat free on Sundays! Win! We have been back a few times and the pizza has been fantastic every time.  Only cons are how close all the tables are to one another, and the place is so dark I had pull out my iPhone flashlight."}
{"text":"I tend to score perhaps higher than normal because when I like a place I want people to know. Tonight I got the Margherita pizza and while it was very good there were chunks of the pizza with no cheese on it! Now this is my favorite type of pizza and it comes in an impressive variety despite the limited ingredients. Sure the bites with cheese were fantastic, the crust is great and they clearly use quality cheese but the portions without?... well I started to skip those soon enough. Next time I'll have to specifically ask that they leave no blank spots! I asked for extra cheese as it was. Regardless of this serious flaw the pizza was still top notch."}
{"text":"Very good option for some take out pizza in Scottsdale. Nice gluten free crust option (plus $3/pie). Very crowded on the weekend for take out though so call early."}
{"text":"We should have walked out immediately, the odor of old grease was overwhelming! We have been to the Hilton Village location in Scottsdale and always have been extremely pleased, with the cleanliness, quality of food, & excellent service.The reason we chose this location is because it was a Groupon and could only be redeemed at this location.
My husband ordered a beer & pizza. His pizza was just barley ok, the ingredients seemed old. I ordered the sourdough burger & wine. The burger & fries were absolutely disgusting! I was unable to eat my food. The waiter was informed, & could have cared less. It was the Worst food & service we have ever experienced in the Phoenix area! We spent over $50.00 for a horrible evening.We should have followed our first impression when we arrived, better to have lost the $10.00 Groupon fee, & gone to another of the many excellent restaurants we love."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch!  (Only time I have ever eaten here)  Very reasonably priced lunch specials make it even better.  You can get a personal sized pizza and a small salad for around $10.  The chopped salad is delicious."}
{"text":"This location had horrible customer service.  At least 10 minutes I stood at the entrance to be acknowledged.  Then I had to go up to someone to ask where to go to pick up my take out order.  Then to top it off the food was just OK. Not quite delicious like they try to uphold"}
{"text":"This is one of the better lunch spots in Scottsdale. Any salad and any pizza for a flat price (I think $9). Very reasonable. Great atmosphere, easy parking, fast service. So many salad and pizza options you will never get bored."}
{"text":"The wings were extremely dry and not tasty. The pizza was very disappointing and had a strong resemblance to school cafeteria pizza. There was approximately two other customers while I was there on a Saturday night, and the service was slow. A Groupon brought us in, however we weren't allowed to use it due to it being happy hour. The prices were high and unreasonable. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"On my pizza radar. Location is convenient. Inside is a little small but will seat a lot of people with optional outside seating as well. Gets busy really quick. Service adequate. Lighting inside can be a little dim and hard to see the presentation. Good thing I brought a flash.

Came here to try the pizza. Had the Everyday Lunch Special for under $10. Starts with a half salad or a cup of soup then any of the smaller 9\" pizzas on the menu or a half sandwich. Tried the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup which was tasty good and then the Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage Pizza with roasted fennel. Just the right amount of food to still feel like going back to work. Also tried the regular size pizza on another day when I could go home and take a cat nap afterwards. Ordered the Meat Lovers Pizza which has meatball, pepperoni, sausage, and panchetta. The pizzas are pretty good and it is fun see them being made in the open kitchen with the hot brick oven. You could easily order a few types of pizza and share them to experience all the different kinds.

I was hoping for more of a flavor explosion in my mouth but would still go back. Maybe the pizza just needed a drizzle of EVOO at the table and / or  a little more garlic in the red sauce. Looking forward to going back so I can try some of the other types of pizzas as well as the starters and their other types of food on the menu. Order up!"}
{"text":"Not much of a choice here so came in and had pizza .... Do not I mean do not order their fig and prosciutto pizza! 

Had asked to get the cheeseburger and this one has no flavor. $17 later I was better of being hungry. Never again. 

Only reason I have it two starts is bec my server was really nice."}
{"text":"Great customer service, small and cozy place.
Aaron the waiter is awesome and very knowledgeable"}
{"text":"This place rocks my socks off.

My co-workers at my new job brought me here as a welcome to the company gesture and I'm not lying when I say that I ate the best wood-fired pizza 'ive ever had in my entire life today. Not only did I try the Margherita, but then we decided it was necessary to order 2 more, pepperoni and some other mushroom thing. All of them were equally delicious, perfect crust and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. The Caesar salad, also awesome.. and how could we forget the full bar?! 

The outdoor patio is absolutely divine  this time of year and the servers there are not only very friendly, but will yell at the bartender when he pours you a weak drink. I dont remember your name dude, but thank you for being the most wonderful person of the day.

I dont normally rave about pizza, and I usually only eat it when im hammered, but Humble Pie has won my heart, and I forsee many many more lunch breaks being taken here.. hammered or not."}
{"text":"I'd just like to thank Andrew K. for introducing me to this gem. You are a wonderful wonderful man because dudes, this place is delicious. Strawberries, Gorgonzola & candied pecans on fresh greens - hell yes. Perfect pizza crust that is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside covered with delicious fresh toppings. Cozy seating AND a full bar. This place is pizza perfection and you need to go here immediately. The mouthgasm is totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"The inside of restaurant is small and the acoustics are horrible, therefore it is a little noisy. The window behind bar facing east could use shades, there is reflected light as sun goes down.
There were three floor servers, two male and a female. She seemed more capable then the other two ya-hoos. (One was a manager!)
The crust on the artichoke pizza was exceptional!  I wanted to try the apple crisp dessert but check arrived prior to being asked if we wanted anything else. Not a good idea guy!  We will certainly give this place another try. This time though, we will ask for the female server!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I've ever had. Reading the menu one would think it's pretty tasty--- NOT! I got a burnt pizza with no flavor mozzarella. The basil was burnt as well. The sauce was dumped in the pizza so it was soggy on top with burnt crust. Blehkkkk!!! If I have time to return it I would but I was boarding as soon as I got my pizza so that was a waste of $12.00. Save yourself the $12 and buy something else."}
{"text":"Yaaawwwwwnnn!!!!! Next!
There are better pizza joints in town!"}
{"text":"I've given this place the benefit of the doubt multiple times and have tried really hard to like this place, I really have. Is it better than Pizza Hut? Yes. Am I always confused and dissapointed when I eat here? Yes. Will I stop eating here and find a better pizza place? No. 

Why? The service has me hooked. It is one of the very few places that I will continue patronizing due to the impeccable service I have received each and every time I have visited. Dine-in, take-out, drinking at the bar, it doesn't matter. They rock it.  

Now, the pizzas. They have come up with some of the most outlandish and interesting combinations of ingredients to throw on a wood-fire blazed pie. You would think will all the Gorgonzola, artichoke and grilled chicken it would taste amazing, so good that your taste buds sweat at the thought of this pizza being served on your table and alas....

No, it doesn't happen. I do not understand how a pizza can come out so bland and tasteless that I have more taste in licking the napkin that I do in enjoying this beautiful yet boring pie. I just don't get it. I will keep trying until I figure out this mystery once and for all. 

P.S. - To the owners, PLEASE add some lighting to the middle of your restaurant. I feel like a suburban emo kid with divorced yet supportive parents on the border of taking the butter knife and carving my wrists when I eat inside your restaurant. On second thought, that might give my pizza some extra kick to it. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I never eat at a place twice.  But today I did at Humble Pie. I was in town for work and the gals suggested i walk over to Humble Pie. Their 9.99 lunch special was terrific. You get a choice of 4 \"half salads.\" I chose the delightfully fresh chopped salad. Fresh housemade mozarella, grape tomatoes, chopped lettuce that looked like romaine, salami, shredded turkey and a tasty dressing.  Everything was chopped bite size and it had such great flavor. I also got a 9 inch artichoke pizza. Artichoke, cheese, carmelized onions on a tasty chewy crust. It was the perfect lunch. 

My girlfriend had the veggie salad and delightful margharita pizza. The veggie salad was also topped with slices of avocado.

At the end of my work day I decided to go back to Humble pie and order a large chopped salad. Delish!  I think I may even go back tomorrow.

Happy hour glasses of wine are $5 each. The service was great and the lunch deals cannot be beat. The waiter passed by with a plate of lasagne, it looks wonderful, as did the spaghetti and meatballs.  Maybe next time, although the chopped salad was perfection!"}
{"text":"Great pies! We just had a guys trip down to Scottsdale and I think we ate here a least 2 or 3 times. The pies are delicious!! They keep it simple and use really good quality ingredients! 

i am personally a huge anything PESTO fan, so I ordered the grilled chicken Pesto and it was great! Among the group, I think, we ended up ordering like 5 pizza before heading out to the bars!  Another memorable one was the roasted mushroom. 

The pizza place was a 7/serious pie(seattle)!!  Would recommedn!"}
{"text":"Happy hour prices are good. We like their cheesy bread and tempura green beans. Friendly bartenders that remember our drink orders."}
{"text":"I love pizza and just to put things in perspective, I didn't finish mine.  It's thin crust, but they over cook it to the point where the cheese becomes hard.  For $11.99, it's definitely not worth it.  You're better off going anywhere else or even get a packaged snack.  When my pizza was ready, they kept yelling \"Mary\".  My name is Kami...so close to the name Mary.  Move over Starbucks...you have bad name interpretation competition!  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because the employees were decent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a nice Father's Day dinner here last weekend. It took a few min to get a table inside since we hasn't made a reservation. The hostess was able to luckily squeeze us inside as opposed to the patio. 
There was a great promotion going on for a free pizza that day. We started with beer and appetizers. None of the happy hour food items sounded that great but all draft beer was only $2.50! Can't beat that especially with a good selection of local beer like sleepy dog and four peaks. For apps, we tried the fried ravioli and spicy buffalo wings. Both were excellent, I would def recommend the ravioli! The app margerita pizza we ordered was pretty small but tasty. 
The full size pizzas come in a huge variety of toppings.. We tried the goat cheese and artichoke pizzas. I recommend the goat cheese pizza as it had fresh cuts of grape tomatoes. The crust was perfectly chewy and wood fired, my favorite kind if pizza. All in all, a great meal, made better by good happy hour and free pizza for Father's Day! Not sure if I'd come back during normal hours since the pizzas are on the pricier end."}
{"text":"I picked up an egg, cheese, and potato breakfast burrito to eat during my flight.  I had it for about two hours and it kept really well!  It would be extremely easy to slap this combination together for a tasteless boring burrito.  I'm happy to report that it was not at all.  I definitely recommend getting the salsa they offer when you pick up your order.  

If you want a meal to carry on that keeps well, this is a great choice.  Staff were very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Looks like a good place to eat. Friendly bartenders. Small-ish. Good decor, for what it is. Has a bar (only bar in this area of the C gates). They are flex on when they close, apparently. On the day I found myself here, they stopped food service just as I walked up (right before 8pm), but the bar was still open. Last call at the bar was 8:45pm. Big bonus: There are outlets at the bar so you can charge up your devices. Friendly bartender and outlets won me over. Wish I could've tried the pizza."}
{"text":"Love HP for lunch.  when I have a pizza and soup craving, this is my go-to place.  The butternut soup is the best you'll find.  And you can't ever go wrong with their pizza."}
{"text":"Shared lunch with Mrs Beautiful. Like the other HPs this one delivered a solid meal and good service. The salads (wedge & veggie) we cold, crisp and delicious (anything with avocado is, right?). Following, at just the right time, were two pizzas straight from the oven (mushroom and shrimp). Again, a solid performance. Flavorful, toppings (anything with bacon and shrimp is, amIright?). And the crust!  One of the best!  Crisp, chewy that holds it all together."}
{"text":"Pretty sad when the 4 parties that you seen get seated after you have their orders taken and food at their table before you have stop and ask someone how you place an order for food here!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Humble Pie and my first to the Desert Ridge location. Both times were excellent. On this most recent trip I had the lunch special, a personal sized pizza and a choice of soup or a half salad. I had the Steak & Turkey chili which was a bit too vinegary for my taste but the pizza was excellent. I opted for the Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage pizza; the taste, texture, thin crust, everything about it was exquisite. There is a nice selection of white and red pies and though it's a bit pricier than your average pizza, this is a couple of notches above average pizza. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here on \"couples night\" at 920PM near closing time. We ordered their special which was an appetizer, salad and pizza for $25.99. The appetizer was decent and salad was good as well however the Pizza which was a Fig & Pig was listed under Red Sauce Pizza's came with Fig Jam sauce. I was completely mislead to believe the Pizza came with marinara sauce. I asked the server why a pizza with Jam sauce was listed under a Red Sauce she was unsure and the manager didn't have a response either. I ended up ordering another pizza and still paying for the Fig and Pig  pizza which is a terrible pie and should be nowhere near a menu. I'm giving 1 star for the appetizer and salad and 1 star for our waitress because she was kind. I won't return to this place because we had to pay for 2 pizza's as opposed to management acknowledging that we were unhappy with our Pie and simply exchanged it for another."}
{"text":"We went in on Sunday 12:30. Our server took 20 minutes to get our waters and soda, and when dropping it off; then took our food order. She explained she was the only server for half of restaurant. Where was the Manager?

The food was good when it finely came. They forgot we added mushrooms to our pizza. We felt bad for our server, under managed and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I love the food at Humble Pie. Their Prosciutto and Pear pizza is amazing. I also love their wings and salads. I really have only one complaint and it's in regards to the way they sit people there.  We like to go there when it's not busy but no matter if there is only one other couple in the joint, they will sit you right next to them.  I mean literally right next to them, like a couple of feet away while the rest of the room is empty. It might not seem like that big of deal to most but it bothers us. But like I said, this is my only complaint. We continue going back because the food is so good. Btw, the Scottsdale location is a lot better than the Peoria location. The one in Peoria is ridiculously loud and I felt the food was inferior."}
{"text":"Just discovered Humble Pie! Love it! Just popped in for a drink and appetizers so we have to come back for pizza! Food is delicious! Bartender and management are great, love and appreciate good customer service. Definitely returning to this location right by the aquarium!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza great lunch specials and happy hour!  And allows dogs on the patio which is a plus for me! Love dog friendly places.  Will return again and again."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. The burgers are tasty and juicy. The fries are delicious and served hot. Two favorites of mine are the Grilled Tuna and BLT with avocado on sourdough sandwiches. The manager, Jordan is a good guy. The wait staff is efficient and friendly. Ryan was bartender tonight. He is a super guy. Thank you, Humble Pie, for another wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"Just took my kids to pizza camp, what fun!!!! Want to give a big thank you to Scott and Ashley. They made the experience awesome and welcoming. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Ate at this location recently with my family. The service was great. Our drinks were never empty and our food came out quickly. We tried their pizza, bruchetta, mozz squares, calamari and a burger. All of it was great. Will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  My fellow Yelpers captured all there is to know about Humble Pie: great atmosphere, great patio, great pizza, great service.

I would only add that I loved...LOVED...the eclectic ingredients that were paired together.  I had the pistachio pie...who wouldda thunk?  It was so good!

Great company makes any experience better, and I had great company as well.  I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I have a food allergy so I emailed the address on their website and asked if there's any gluten free options because my friends said the food is so good. Minutes later I got a one word response: No. Ok I guess but why not talk up the salads? Drink specials? Sorry to bother you, manager."}
{"text":"Humble Pie was recco'd to me for their happy hour and a friendly place for a woman to go herself and sit at the bar with no problem. 

I'm on holidays from Frozen Tundra Minnesota and love patios and sangria.  While the patio at HP is OK, I did love the $5 Sangria at happy hour.  

I didn't eat, but I enjoyed 3 sangrias.  I checked out the happy hour menu and it looked like a great value.  

I would have no problem coming back here again on my own, with friends or on a date night.  

If you are traveling and in the area, it is a middle of the road place for great happy hour food and drink.  The ambiance is a bit dark and the chairs around the patio side of the bar are not that comfortable. But, I did like that there were MANY bar seats.  So many bars have just a few seats... this place did very well with their bar seating."}
{"text":"Have tried it several times for pizza and the pasta and the food is good but the portions were lunch portions at dinner prices"}
{"text":"Love coming here, great woodfired pizzas, very good happy hour and quality food!"}
{"text":"Discovered this while in town for a conference and ended up going back three times during the week. We highly recommend and will definitely visit on our next time in town."}
{"text":"Great local neighborhood joint! Thursday Night date night menu is reasonable - pick 1 appetizer, 2 salads and a pizza to share for only $25. Did I mention the live music too??!! Love the BLT pizza and spinach salad."}
{"text":"We walked in Friday night at 6:30.  There were several open tables both inside and out.  We asked to be seated outside.  As soon as we stepped onto the patio I could smell that someone was smoking and commented about it.  The table next to me said that there were actually 2 parties on the patio smoking and that they had complained.  I immediately went to find an employee to tell them.  The answer was to ask the smoker to step on the other side of the 1/2 wall.  We left and will never return."}
{"text":"My bosses have brought in late afternoon snacks of humble pie a few times now and I've enjoyed it all! I've never stepped foot in here, nor noticed whilst driving through Scottsdale, so clearly I won't speak to parking, service, atmosphere. 

I've had the Margherita, the local veggie one, and most recently the potato and gorgonzola pie. That has been the most decadent so far, the fingerling potatoes are really sweet and tender and the rosemary adds a great savory flavor. I didn't get a strong sense of the gorgonzola, which I love in general, but the size of the pie is perfect and the crust was firm but chewy in the middle and an all around treat."}
{"text":"Go here for happy hour!!! They have cheese, pepperoni and margherita pizza on special for $7.50 and it's so delicious. My husband and I may pack on a few pounds because i think we will be going here every week. They also have other great specials, so be sure to check them out.

My other favorite aspect is the atmosphere...it's like cheers. The Coronado community has chosen this great place as their stomping ground and we were welcomed into the community right away - great group of people! 

Who doesn't love a place with good food, great people and an overall awesome experience!?!"}
{"text":"Great selection of appetizers, salad, sandwiches,   pizza, dessert and impressive wine list for a pizza restaurant!   We were really hungry after a long day of moving so we started with the meatball appetizer and Caesar salad! Oh so glad we did!  Tender flavorful meatballs in a light marina sauce smothered in mozzarella!  Even the Caesar salad was perfectly dressed! The BBQ chicken pizza was delectable with a slight kick to the sauce and the meatlovers was loaded with meaty goodness!   To finish off our meal we just couldn't decide between the chocolate chip cookie sundae or donut holes so we got both!!   This may have been our first visit but certainly will not be our last !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday afternoon for the first time.  We chose to eat on the patio and it started to get a little chilly, so our waiter Sean brought a heater over to warm us up because we didn't want to go inside. 
We each ordered our own pizza and I also had salad greens.  The goat cheese pizza is perfect!!
Sean recommended that we the pizza cookie with vanilla ice cream. AMAZING!
Our experience here was exceptional! Sean was a very friendly and attentive waiter and we will request him when we go back!

If you haven't dined here before, you MUST go!"}
{"text":"In town on business and looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night. This worked out great. Casual atmosphere, friendly staff, good food. Their pizza tastes handmade and not cookie cutter style like so many other places. As others have said the crust is thin, but it's very good and the flavor makes up for it regardless of what style you like. They have a good selection of food on their menu: pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salad. Really something for everyone. Their fried donut holes for dessert were yummy and fun for us all to share and felt like a bunch of kids with smiles on our faces as we ate the them."}
{"text":"It was a girl's afternoon and we went there for the 1st time Easter afternoon.  We split the crispy calamari and chopped salad (we ordered the small and it was still a huge portion) and had a couple of Blue moon beers and red sangria.  We topped our meal off with some doughnut holes while we were finishing our drinks.  The atmosphere is casual and everything was delicious and our server was super nice and funny we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I always love coming to this establishment.  I have always encountered good food and good customer service."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint. Well located. Nice ambience, delicious food, good service. Also love their pazookie!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!!!  I eat at the Scottsdale Humble Pie frequently, I really think this new one kicks butt.  Ask for Bryce he's probably the best server I have ever seen.  

On our last visit we had a salad and pizza combo for lunch I did the chop salad and meat lovers pizza,  my girlfriend had the wedge salad and pepperoni pizza.  Everything was top notch, the service was remarkable the food is never a let down.  We had a question about wine, apparently the manager here is a professional about anything wine.  WOW he blew us away, it was really neat not just to enjoy the food but to get a quick lesson on wine.

So like I said, \"good stuff\""}
{"text":"Sad to say but I've been coming to humble pie off 7th street for a long time and have gotten to the point where I'm going out of my way to write this review. I'm never one to openly downgrade or talk bad about any business but after tonight I have decided to no longer eat here. I walked in to place an order for take out and was not greeted. Once I flagged a worker down to place a worker, he responded by looking at his phone clock as to possibly say it might be too late. It was not, lol I was \"just in time.\" So, after I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza, I had to find myself a seat to wait for the order to be made. Never offered water or beverage while waiting, (which I guess is fine but this is my review) once the pizza was done I opened to find one of the worst looking pizzas I have ever seen. Not to mention one of the items that is always on the pizza (celery) was missing. I awkwardly asked about the celery and got \"oh do you still want the celery?\" Im response. At that point I felt it appropriate to point out how poorly made, the pizza looked. Cheese poorly spread around crust, and chicken sparsely placed on about a fourth of the pizza. I love this place and the food tastes pretty good but after reoccurring incidents like this, again, I will not be eating here again. The one star is for when the food ordered is made correctly, or in correlation to how it is presented on the menu. The staff didn't seem to care or find anything wrong with the pizza. Again I am not picky and have never ever even posted about any other restaurants on yelp."}
{"text":"We had heard how good this place was and got to the airport a little early so decided to partake while we waited for our plane. It was quite busy, but we were seated quickly and the waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink order. When he returned with our drinks we were ready to order our food. We ordered a couple of different pies (pizza) to share. One came out fairly quickly but the other was missing. Our waiter, Ryan, quickly realized the oversight and addressed it directly by apologizing and promising to get the other pie out as quickly as possible. After a few minutes our pie still hadn't arrived and our waiter told us he was still working on it and would take care of us. A couple of minutes later he delivered the other pie and also brought his manager by to also apologize and let us know that they would comp both pies. It was unfortunate we had this mixup, but they handled it directly and graciously and you can't ask for better than that! To top it off the pies and the drinks were delicious!! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the Phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"Best (draft) happy hour and amazing atmosphere. I am here 2 days a week for the awesome pizza and the beer. Also, great place to come read and drink when you have nothing to do."}
{"text":"As a rule excellent.  But avoid crunch hours as they are noisey and service suffers.  Of peak times are gold.  Good food overall.  But I've been known to wait 20 minutes for orders.  But they are fresh and well done. It's a reliable mainstay."}
{"text":"As a rule excellent always.  Friendly service, fresh and speedy service.  A guarantee anytime."}
{"text":"Stopped in between flights. Didn't expect too much. Was a pleasant surprise. We were waited on by Eric T. He was quick to acknowledge us, our food was quick and good and he took care to keep our drinks full. It provided a nice break to relax which could have been destroyed by a bad server. Thank you Eric, and to the guys working hard in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food and price was great. But today the service was pretty poor. Only 1 waitress was around after delivering her food. Long long brunette hair in a ponytail. I only wish she was serving us. The other waiters and waitresses ordered and delivered food. Outside of that, they weren't even present to even wave down. Disappointing visit today."}
{"text":"Do you want awesome and different pizza options? This is the place. They have great tasting pizza toppings and combinations that you don't find anywhere else. I had the The Egg Pizza. Definitely a must try. The service was fast and VERY good. Ask for Bryce. He was great. Very personable and loves unique food combination so make sure you ask him for suggestions. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! The veggie salad was a great choice. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. We had the chicken Parmesan pizza which was also delicious. They have the most amazing pizza dough. We started out with the caprice  app which was yummy and original"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place. I've heard it was a hit or miss but both me and my girlfriend are definitely dissatisfied with our meal. Won't come back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant discriminates based on gender; went in tonight and was told that all women get free pizzas and men do not, so I walked out..."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty, they had a nice menu to choose from and I'm always a fan of fire baked pizza. There are plenty of beverages and the outdoor patio with \"mist-ers\" make for a pleasant and refreshing treat--seeing as it's as hot as the surface of hell in Arizona.

However, it's always packed with people, which is a plus because you know everything is good; but, the tables and chairs are so close together that's it's hard to squeeze in anywhere. It's also pretty dark and musty, so when you leave it's nice to get a breath of fresh air (although, the dry Arizona heat hardly constitutes as \"fresh\"). 

All in all, a decent place for dinner. It's a little on the pricy side--so if you don't want to buy the doughnut holes here for dessert, just slip over to a Krispy Creme and snag a dozen for a few bucks. Hey, I'm just telling it to ya straight--woman to.. Well, you. 

Tips & Tricks: 
* Be sure to get pizza, the best is the meat lovers! It's only big enough for two people though, so keep your gathering intimate. 
* Parking is a beast. Try parking in the surrounding locations, a good spot is at the bank across the way... At least I think it was a bank--I was too focused on filling my belly to notice."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Humble Pie, but never been. I don't plan on returning. I ordered the Ceasar Salad and the dressing was super watered down and almost flavorless. The gluten free pizza crust left much to be desired (I appreciate they had the GF option though). The red sauce tasted like it was from a jar. I don't mean to be so critical but the food really was NOT good. I went with 3 friends and NONE Of us like our food. Service was OK. Definitely not memorable or reason enough to go back ."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! I ordered a pepperoni pizza and added extra mozzarella balls and a fried egg! Their mozzarella cheese is made in house and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pizza and burger. The food was good but the service was pretty slow. Our waitress knew we had to get going but she took her sweet time to get us or bill. Also, for some reason the people who came after us were getting their food before us."}
{"text":"Humble Pie has a fantastic lunch special where you can get any salad and any pizza for under $10. The salads are great and there are a ton of different pizza options, including some fancy vegetarian ones. I had the apple arugula salad, which was amazing. It is such a refreshing salad, and the dressing was amazing. I also had the arugula pizza, which I picked because of the house-made mozzarella, and it was okay. The cheese was sort of grainy as opposed to being luscious and thick, and I didn't love the taste of the crust (tasted a little like Chinese food, which was unexpected), but overall it was satisfying. 

I would definitely come back here for a salad."}
{"text":"This place never fails to amaze us! Food is always excellent! They always have cold draft beer (keeps my husband happy!). Pizza is so delicious. Wings are yummy! Pasta yummy! Salads yummy! They have unbeatable happy hour prices too! We love this place! We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"9.00 breakfast burrito.  Cashier already, made me want to leave.  Acted, like we were an issue.  Salsa? If there are two of you,  ask for 2."}
{"text":"The food here is good and that's why we keep trying it. They have pretty good gluten free crust. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food is good. The service is horrible! Every single time but tonight was exceptionally terrible. Our iced tea was not refilled once and remained empty the whole meal. We watched the server wait on 2 other tables 6 plus times while we sat with empty plates waiting for a check or even to be checked on."}
{"text":"(The continuing story of a yelp-loving couple seeking great locally owned joints, friendly service and a comfortable atmosphere for playing Magic the Gathering...)

Randomly hit this place at the end of our time on a Sunday before we had to go pick up our toddler from her playschool.  Little awkward as it looked like a meetup was going on at the bar and someone mistakenly thought they knew me.  The place is dark, brick, nice semi-circle bar for the more drink-leaning patrons.  For us, it was kind of loud and the tables were definitely on the small side.

We headed to the back of the place (average small/bistro sized joint with a small outside seating area) away from the bar.  Ordered the Goat Cheese pizza to split - I think they are about 11\" so good size for this.  Food came out pretty quickly and was good.  Didn't blow me away, but soild.  Nice to see ricotta and goat cheese as options though.  I must say, I was more impressed with the service.  Four different attendants in plain clothes hit every table interchangeably.  Never had to wait for anything, including drop off and pick-up of the check (always a major Tsk Tsk point...) so kudos to them on that.

Unfortunately, not a good contender for our tastes and not the atmosphere we are looking for.  But I could see the meetup at the bar was lively so a nice place for some.  MTG Score: DH 1 / Me 2"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and made my first visit a great one. Pizza is great. Not the best I've ever had but it was delicious. Plenty to chose from on the menu. Good happy hour specials. Will have to stop by again and spend more time here."}
{"text":"Place was great. Had the roasted mushroom pizza. Tasted awesome. 

Pros: 
-Good pizza
-Great selection

Cons:
-Don't understand why they have a calendar of the events going on in Phoenix... Why not use that space to promote specials or something?
-Not poppin. I like to be seenzzz"}
{"text":"Order a burger blt togo. Waitress ask for my name so when it's ready she'll call me. So I stated my name is Nathan. After approx. 20 I said my flight is boarding. Please check my order. She came back and assume my name is LEE just because i'm Asian. I ask how did she came up with Lee she said it's already on the order. I'M NATHAN NOT LEE YOU RACIST ahole. Just because i'm asian i must be Lee!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out at the Desert Ridge location, and on Saturdays they have all day happy hour! I highly recommend the fried green beans! The Margherita pizza was also cooked to perfection! Very intimate small place with a nice outside patio and bar area. I would have liked another side with the pretzel, the mustard was very overpowering, also it was not very busy and our service was rather slow for it being a slower night. Overall great date night spot or if you're in the mood for good pizza, drinks and apps! I'll be going back:)"}
{"text":"Even for airport food this is pretty low quality. Step up your game if you expect to stay in terminal 4!

Ordered a margherita pizza...very plain, flimsy crust, underwhelming."}
{"text":"I met a couple of friends here on a Friday night for drinks. The place wasn't that busy. The waitress was pleasant. The food came to the table pretty fast after the order was placed. I have the chopped salad. It was delicious!  And my friends split a pizza and pasta.  Both of them had great comments about the food."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.  Fries are up there with best ever.  Our server was outstanding. Polite and attentive, she knew about everything on the menu and the history of the company. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"The 21 year old blonde bartender provided some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I am a single mother with a disabled child and had 1 drink. After I had 1 drink and the patron next to me asked for another, I too asked for another. She refused to serve me, but gladly served the other patron that did not have a disabled child. She was very rude and clearly just wanted to leave and get going versus serving the customers. It is a shame I was discriminated against by her. She was working the closing shift on Friday night, January 15, 2016 at 9:40pm. She is a young blonde female at the bar. If the owner of this establishment cares about other patrons that have children with disabilities you should at a very minimum put her on some type of discipline plan or I would recommend you terminate her employment"}
{"text":"Friday night 7:30- had reservations, but did not really need them.  When we got there, a server 10 feet away told us to go and grab our table, it was already set up.  Service was not bad but it was not great either..  It was like they could care less if we were there or not :).. Had the bruschetta, had a few different ways of preparing, it was very good.  I had the specialty pizza and it was good as well, my friend had the pasta with chicken, did not have much flavor.  Overall, I enjoyed dinner, would I go back.. maybe, but probably not, there are many other italian places I would prefer over this place. Improve the atmosphere would make a big difference.  Parking was tough because the restaurant next door was packed.."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Love all the pizzas and salads.  The potato garlic pizza is pure heaven.  The cookie dessert is similar to Oregano's and is DELICIOUS.  This location struggled with finding good staff initially, but I think they have turned around 100%.  Good place for kids too."}
{"text":"Great personal pan pizzas. Salads too. Nice servers. Clean restrooms. Lots of space. Not too crowded."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in our pizza.  We ordered take out tonight - one pepperoni and one margherita.  The total was almost 30 dollars and the pizza's were extremely small, AND the pepperoni pizza did not have any cheese on it.   We would have been better off going to Grimaldi's - they are a bit pricier but at least you get what you pay for!  Never going back here...which is a shame because it's a great location!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there are on the balcony at the bar. Were originally sitting at a table requested a move as it was rather warm   There were no misters or fans operating

Wanted a salad but could not find a salad that had some protein. Ended up with cup of soup and half salad express lunch. Both were very average.  My friend had the salad and pizza option. Her salad was very sad looking but the pizza looked and smelt great   

Servers were nice and friendly. The pizza looked great think it is a better pizza place than a quick lunch salad place"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their pizza and their service is just excellent! I highly recommend the Humble Pie! You just can't go wrong with it!"}
{"text":"Any better options here at sky harbor.  Had the pizza and was not impressed at all.  Check out some of the others that have great reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"For a airport pizza restaurant this was very good. Crust homemade and ingredients also good. We had the chicken pesto. There was more than a sufficient amount of chicken  that it fell off when you picked it up. We felt the cost was very reasonable. Service was good also."}
{"text":"W/out a doubt one of the best lunch deals in value and taste. ends at three 3pm. I always get the wedge salad and meat pizza. Just can't go wrong. $10.00. Add a beer and tip well."}
{"text":"Buyer beware! Regular gin and tonic was $15!  That is insane.   No where are these prices posted and the beer is $6.50 on the menu, so who is God's name would expect such a crazy markup? Even high end clubs don't charge that amount."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! The crust is perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I came here for lunch today with my friend and we each had the pizza + 1/2 salad special for $10. 

Pizza:

S.O.S. - if you like ricotta cheese and sausage, order this pizza! It has mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers. So yum. 

Pepperoni- the mozzarella on this pizza as well on the other pizzas is so cheesy and fresh, and just melts in your mouth! You can tell they use quality ingredients, not any of that cardboard crap. The pepperonis on this pizza are on the smaller size and taste delicious. 


Desserts:

I have yet to try the desserts, but I saw the menu and everything sounded amazing. 
I want to come back here and try their white pizzas, wine; and the chocolate chip cookie pizza with ice cream!

{"text":"My husband and I arrived on a Sunday afternoon before our long trip back to California. We asked the consiour at our hotel where they recommended for lunch and they suggested humble pie. Located  across the street from our resort, we arrived to a pretty packed parking area. We were seated immediately and ordered right away. I decided to go fancy and ordered the fig and prosciutto while the hubby got the meat lovers. Between the two I must say the meat lovers was better. Although the prosciutto and fig was good, after my second slice I was getting tired of it. I kept picking off the pepperoni and sausage off his pie. The meats actually had a good spice to it (not spicy spice but spice ). So if your trying to figure out which pie to get, I recommend the meat lovers."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch this afternoon around 2pm.  I chose to be seated outside since we can now enjoy the lovely outdoors. I understand 2pm is right after the lunch crowd.... but let me tell you- the place was a mess. I am really surprised the manager is allowing the guests to sit in the area that is not cleaned. I am rating the cleanness of the restaurant when I was there a 1! There were birds jumping from table to table. The dishes were left at every table around me. Then the cold beer came and it got much better. I had their tuna salad melt sandwich which was good. I didn't care for their humble pie sausage minestrone. It tasted like they cut the sausage into the soup after it was made."}
{"text":"My husband and I split a chopped salad and a white mushroom pizza and we wanted to lick the plates. The pizza here is delicious, you'll definitely eat all of your crust. We've been to the Scottsdale location and had the best bruschetta there, but since we were downtown, this location was more convenient  Will probably head to Scottsdale next time."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal 4, across from Gate 4 (Southwest gates).

Looking for a tasty bite before your flight? The pepperoni pizza and cheese pizza were both surprisingly REALLY good. Great service too! 

Cesar salad is not worth the $8. It wasn't really good at all."}
{"text":"Never come to the airport hungry. The food prices are about the same as the flights lol. But no really its a nice spot its like a olive garden with a bar. The pizza i had was great it was nice and crispy were it should be. The cheese was melted perfectly. Its pretty busy in there ofcourse. But if you want to make the other people on the plane jealous grab a fresh pizza and bring that bad boy on the plane.

Roadway to yelp elite"}
{"text":"Humble pie has become a go restaurant for my family. When I became a parent I was worried we would be relegated to eating at places like Red Robin until my kids were in college. As a \"foodie\" this deeply concerned me. I made the decision that we would train our kids to be well behaved in a restaurant so we could continue to have fun dining experiences. Well, that didn't happen. My son is one of the pickiest eaters and as never ending ants in the pants which makes sitting for long periods of time a challenge. Thankfully for me there are places like Humble Pie. My husband and I really enjoy the pizza and my son seems to enjoy all the food on the children's menu. The location on 7th street has a trendy vibe and if you can get a seat on the patio, there's always great people watching. On top of good food in a cool atmosphere, they're fast and kids eat free on Sundays!! If you're not a parent, you will really enjoy Humble Pie for their food and drinks, but if you're a parent and want good food in a child friendly atmosphere, look no further than here! It's a win for everyone!"}
{"text":"Legit!! Tempura green beans and ground mustard sauce the best starter. Enjoyed our chicken apple salad. The pizza though... Talk about crust done right?? Kudos to humble pie for getting it right! Did bbq chicken pizza and buffalo chicken wing pizza. Can I have one now?"}
{"text":"My husband favorite place 9 out of 10 time if you ask him Humble Pie is the place. We had a late lunch with a little vino. My husband had the lunch special 9 inch pizza and a salad for 10.99 a great deal. Happy hour 11-6. Service was great. Love to hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"Humble Pie just transformed its The Living Room restaurant on 7th Street into this restaurant, and I am sure glad they did!  They had plenty of delicious pizza options.  I brought an appetite, and I was able to eat an entire pie... my wife, on the other hand, ate most of her pizza but brought one or two slices home.

The service was great.  When I ordered, I wasn't certain what to get, so I asked our waitress for help.  She recommended the pepperoni pizza but that I add olives on top.  I was immediately convinced, and I'm glad I was, as it was delicious!  The pepperonis were large, and the olives were a mixture of multiple olive types (as opposed to just cut-up black olives).  In addition to a tremendous pizza recommendation, our waitress was constantly refilling our drinks and checked in multiple times.  

One thing we noticed was a Thursday Night \"Date Night\" special.  For $20, Humble Pie is offering 2 pizzas and a salad.  We will definitely be back to try this Thursday special out soon!"}
{"text":"I visited the Scottsdale restaurant on a recent vacation and the pizza i had was the best pizza i ever had, it was so good, i had another pizza in the Humble Pie in the Phoenix airport. Great pizza, great prices great everything."}
{"text":"I am going to start off by saying that I was in the restaurant industry for a while and am pretty observant to things that are going on. When we first arrived the hostess had next to no personality. We sat down and the waiter we had was quick and very friendly! While we were sitting there I heard, who I believe to be the manager, complaining to two different employees, at two different times, about the hostess. I actually heard her say, \"I think we need a new hostess.\"In my opinion this is not precessional and quite frankly tacky. It is not something that should be discussed in the open and defiantly not with other employees. I didn't try the food but my boyfriend had a beer. The prices were much higher than they should be but you can expect that at an airport!"}
{"text":"I can actually say I'm surprised to know that there are more than one location of this place. I was sadly disappointed after trying this place. The pizza was unimpressive, it was actually burnt and bland. I was excited about the fact that we got there in time for the \"Happy Hour\" which is 3-6p. We tried the chicken drumettes which were just okay. We also ordered the fries that we were told 'were amazing' and sadly...they were not. We did rather enjoy the calamari. So if you do choose to go there: I guess get the calamari. 
(p.s the server was this amazing college kid. I forget his name, but it was something biblical. GIVE HIM A RAISE)."}
{"text":"The Tuna Melt was absolutely incredible. Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"It was a struggle for me to choose between 2 stars or 3.Its more of a 2.5 but do I want to give them the extra edge?

NO

Anyway I got a regular cheese pizza and for 10 bucks it ended up being 

1)Sour Dough crust WTF, who doesn't metion the crust taste like the most sour sourdough ever?

2) it actually tasted similar to Peter Piper Pizza

3).........................(dots equal drum roll) It was the size of large burger. Seriously it was about equal to 2  and a half normal slices. 

This pizza tasted like shit and for 10 dollars I can go to grimaldis and get an awesome pizza triple the size and quadruple the quality. 

P.S. The waiters uniform makes them look like tools. Like they work in a country club. You know what I'm talking about if you been there."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have at least four stars --- we had the caprese salad and the potato pizza and it was amazing! Usually caprese doesn't stand out but the mozerella was incredible. It is a little on the pricey side for pizza but really good!"}
{"text":"I may be the bad guy for this, but I am not impressed. Yes ,the pizza is OK. But, no tht ebest I have ever had. Not the worst either. But, for the price I was expecting more. I did not feel it was worth it. I cannot say I will not eat here again. But, if I have a choice I would try somewhere else that is all.
The parking is tight in the back when they are busy. The share the lot with the shop next door by the looks of it. I know it is downtown Phoenix and things are tight.
I will give them another try later on down the road."}
{"text":"Pizza places are a dime a dozen so we tend to go to our usual place near our house.  We had to stop in the west valley so we decided to give it a try.  Monday is 1/2 price bottled wine night but it was still happy hour when we arrived so we went a different route on drinks.  My husband LOVED is ice cold beer for $2.50 and I had a fairly sweet white Sangria for $5.  We split a yummy iceberg wedge salad and a SOP pizza.  It had carmalized onions, Schreiners sausage, goat cheese, mozzerella cheese and roasted red peppers.  There was not a crumb left on the pizza tin.  Thanks Daniel.  You were a friendly, helpful waiter.  And I have to admit, the wine wall was pretty impressive.  Not your average cheap wines.  I think I saw some really good ones on the way out the door.  Guess I'll have to go back on a Monday and get a bottle for 1/2 price."}
{"text":"Thin, soggy crust with absolutely no pizza sauce. Not a fan at all. Very disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"So, I hate writing bad reviews, especially for a local business. But, when we could get better pizza and a bag of salad at Costco and save the $30 price tag, have to pass it on. 
Place was nice, but no one seemed to want to be there. The manager walked around saying 'boo' to no one, the cooks couldn't get an order right for our table or the 2 others next to us, and the food was really disappointing. Pizza had absolutely NO taste and the salad was totally just chopped lettuce and a slice of avocado for $13. The only reason it gets a single star is for our waitress - she was so kind and helpful, felt sorry for her to be working there. 
Plenty of other places to go in the area, but not here."}
{"text":"How do you approach a place that makes fancy pizzas, but is also a small chain with overly trendy decor?  I feel like if you set your expectations properly, you can have an enjoyable meal at a place like this.

No, this isn't the best pizza you can find.  But it's better than you'd think it would be.

They had some interesting topping combinations.  Some of them sounded pretty good.  I think they were inventive without being too gimmicky.

At the same time, the best pizza places are the ones that throw just a few toppings on, make sure they contrast well and are high quality, and let the rest of the pie speak for itself.  Here, you get the feeling that the focus on the toppings is covering for an otherwise pedestrian pizza.  But that's OK, if you're not expecting the best pizza in the world.

I went with the clam pizza.  I was really excited to find someone in Phoenix makes a clam pizza.  After eating a slice or two, I decided that putting the red peppers on there was a mistake.  Red peppers are too dominant: they overpowered the clams, which should have been the focal point here.

Really, it's not a bad place.  As far as small local pizza chains are concerned, it is miles ahead of Sauce.  You won't hate your meal, but if you can handle the pretentiousness of Pomo, you might as well go across the street and have a much better pie."}
{"text":"Been here twice on Thursdays for Date Night.  Plan on making this one of our go-to places.  $20 for a pizza (your choice) two salads (plenty to choose from and all tasty!) and one app- we went for the tempura green beans and loved them.  Ambience is a little lacking but hey, it's a pizza joint (with a full bar).  Better than most, give it a try!"}
{"text":"There has to be at least 30 dining options in the Desert Ridge area.  Pretty much anything you're looking for from Fast Food to Fast Casual to sit-down and take in the sights. One of the options that really hits that sweet spot for me between Fast Casual and sit-down is Humble Pie.

Full menu during the lunch rush and a hidden gem on the menu is a small individual pizza and one of their salads for $9.95.  Fantastic bargain!  So many times with an offer like this you get a choice of a cheese or pepperoni pizza and a tossed salad.  Not at this humble little pizzeria.  They let you choose from their full pizza and salad list.

Like steel to a magnet, if I see the name Schreiner's sausage, I'm in. . . All in. Ordered the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage with roasted fennel (nearly everything is better roasted) with house made mozzarella.  Had to add some jalape√±os (mistake). Went with the Veggie salad and this was an incredible little salad; jicama, white beans, avocado, light dressing-delicious!

The pizza was fantastic!  Excellent flavors and a beautifully thin crust.  There are a couple of options in this area for pizza, Slices, California Pizza Kitchen, La Bocca on High Street, the new Midici (also very good).  Have to say, Humble Pie was terrific!  Fantastic service and a patio that is well shaded yet a pleasure to eat on.  Will definitely put this into my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I love the food here and I love the ambience and feel of the restaurant, ... when it's not packed. The location is too small. When it's busy, the place is crammed and it gets loud and hard to maneuver between tables. But I  guess that's a testament to how good the food really is. 
The salads are so damn good. I honestly can't pick a favorite. I like to try a new pizza each time I go. Some of my favorites off the menu are the BLT and the Pear & Proscuitto. There are so many good ones!!! 
People mention the prices in a lot of the reviews but you get what you pay for. I do wish they would have more coupons to the neighboring residents to encourage us to keep coming back or to thank us for our loyalty. Some of the ways to get a wee discount are to come during happy hour which is like 11-7. It's a large timeframe. The lunch menu is also really affordable. Some of their promos are date night Thursdays and 1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays. 
I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great here! And not just great as in the prices are right but the location is good too. I really like their patio area too. It has curtains and heat lamps so you're nice and warm but away from the restaurant. Try their chicken parmesan pizza. You'll be in heaven!"}
{"text":"So first time here. I was excepting it to be like fired pie but with more food choices. Well boy I was wrong. I'm pretty upset cause nothing tasted good, it was very tasteless. Also everything was pretty expensive but we came for happy hour but definitely not worth going for that either.

They do have happy hour every day. 3pm-6pm for food & for drinks it starts 11am-6pm. On Sundays kids eat free if you buy something for $10. They also have a patio to sit outside. They also have tvs. 

So we started with appetizers the fried mozzarella (like cheese sticks) it had no seasoning or taste to it. It definitely needed salt though. Maybe u will taste some thing from the after taste but definitely wasn't impressed. I had better mozzarella sticks else where. 
We also got the chicken drumettes (basically Buffalo wings) definitely wasn't impressed taste nothing as well. No spice or sauce on them. I could have gone to Little Ceasers & got basically the same wings but with better sauce on them and for cheaper. 
Lastly we got the pizzas I got sausage on mine. I had no idea it's $3 to add a topping! My sister & brother got pepperoni. First bite I took reminded me of peter piper pizza. Not a fan. My sisters and brothers pepperoni kept falling when trying to eat it. The crust was okay. Also the kid size pizza is the same size as the happy our pizza 10\". 

Definitely not worth spending your money."}
{"text":"Today I stopped in with my mother and ordered some food thinking it was gonna be a great experience.
The appetizers were good. The pizza was NOT!
Soggy! Bland! Toppings were not evenly on it...
Ordered the S.O.P.... Told the young kid who was the manager and he said he wasn't a fan of some of the pizzas. I was disappointed he didn't even bother to make a new one or anything. Never been disappointed before, but this takes the hit.
I don't think the pizza was fully cooked and No sympathy for customer service."}
{"text":"Humble Pie.. Not Humble People.. I ordered for take out about 25 min before close (I had just gotten off a 12 hour shift at my restaurant job) upon arriving (5 min after 10pm - on a FRIDAY)  we were treated like an inconvenience not a guest and I will not be back.. sorry but I'll stick to Nook Kitchen for my pizza cravings (better service and pizza)"}
{"text":"Pizza loaded with green thread.  What is this???.  No one could eat it, chew it or figure out the smell.  Gross.  This was takeout.  This was not on the pizza we enjoyed in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Just called in an order to pick up, I had a terrible experience! The hostess was rude, order incomplete, wings cold and undercooked. I asked for Parmesan cheese and red pepper, the hostess I believe her name was Jessica told me no, that she did not have time. I just had to reheat everything! Not a happy customer! And I paid $60, should have done delivery!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. For the price there is definately better pizza. (CIBO,$11 Avg.) but for west, north valley its fair. We got the fries(wife loved them) wings(ok) and the SOP pizza(i didnt like it, tasted plain pepperoni was alot better). We went during happy hour(craft beer only $2.50, loved that)

What upset me was like the previously Steve r. Mentioned; theres was about 5 parties waiting and 4 empty tables that were just standing there. I mentioned to my wife that it was ridiculous and we should go somewhere else, they mightnhave heard because they sat us down right after that.

Waitress seemed like she would try to avoid us so we wouldnt ask for anything else. So i had to tell her to wait a second so she could pay attention. 

Bottom line: Firt time im not impresed. i will come back and hopefully it better."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about how good this place was and I hope the locations outside of the are better. The service was  below average and that goes the same for the pizza. I just tasted kinda \"meh\". Next time I fly out I'll try something different."}
{"text":"Very good to excellent pizza. Nice spot for a casual eat-in dinner with a limited Italian menu perhaps a little pricey - but you get what you pay for. I go for quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Our #1 go to place. Close to home. The service is always spot on. We always seem to be waited on by Ian, Kendall, or Hailey. We love the service they provide and they always make the best food suggestions. Their prices can't be beat and the pizza is soooo good. We have tried almost everything on the menu. The pizzas are great. We have tried the most basic pep and cheese to the BLT pizza and also one with a poached egg on top. I like the veggie salad the best. The penne pasta with vodka sauce is amazing. Good job crew of HP83, keep up the good work and good service."}
{"text":"We normally go to the Tatum Blvd Humble Pie. However, we just recently moved to the area and decided to try this one on Happy Valley. Big Mistake.  We order several items to go.  Our pretzel (which we ordered cheese with) had NO cheese or the mustard that usually comes with it.  The Mozzarella sticks we ice cold and there were only 5 of them.  The mac and cheese was also like plain noodles with a little melted cheese. the portion size was very small. (Again, when we have ordered at  tatum blvd,  the portions were nice size).  We called and spoke to the manager who gave us another order of mozz sticks (9 this time) and cheese for the pretzel that was missing from the first order (which was cold, and tasted like it had been sitting for quite some time) I highly doubt we will ever make a return visit to this particular Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awesome. Good beer and food. But the place has fruit flys everywhere. Otherwise would have given 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. For any of you Gluten Free eaters, the gluten free crust was the fist gluten free crust I have had that did not just taste like card boards. The regular pizza is great too. I really enjoyed that the crust is thin and yet the crust is just so fluffy and tasty. Furthermore, Humble Pie actually pulls their own mozzarella which is almost unheard of now days!!!I Also I really enjoyed their soft pretzel appetizer, the sauce they pair it with it is fantastic. This is a great date place, but can become really pricey really quick."}
{"text":"The family and I really enjoyed going here after church on Sundays but this last time (today) really changed our minds.  I had the chicken parm pizza for the first time and it was GROSS!  The chicken parm tasted like processed greasy pieces of breading with just a hint of chicken inside.  It didn't even look like chicken parm,  YUCK!!! my daughter had the cheese pizza, she even said it was just \"ok.\"  So I tried it and it really was just ok.  The sauce tasted like mass produced pizza sauce from a can at Sams club.  I don't what has changed since the last time we were there but it wasn't for the better.  I will say I had the wedge salad and it was absolutely phenomenal.  If your looking for good pizza I used to tell people Humble pie, but not anymore I'll suggest Sauce from now on."}
{"text":"If you like pizza that costs twice as much as it should, but only tastes half as good as it should, then Humble Pie is for you.  I couldn't believe how much I disliked my pepperoni pizza that cost me $16.49. I fully expected that for that much money the pizza would have been a lot better than \"barely passable.\"

I should have gone to Pei Wei next door for 60% of the price."}
{"text":"The pizza here was the only plus.

We experienced less than mediocre service, my food came out way late - about 15 minutes after the other 5 people at our table received their orders, we had to ask for drink refills at one point, we also had to ask twice to bring out a dipping sauce to go with our tables meals. Once for the sauce, a second time ten minutes later to remind them that it never came to our table. A mistake like burning our pizza and taking an extra 15 + minutes should warrant the floor manager to come to our table and apologize at the very least, which didn't happen.

The restaurant is setup more like a sports bar than a sit down and enjoy your meal type of pizza spot. Inside is pretty loud, difficult to hear, and hard to hold a conversation due to the distracting TV's playing sports located in every direction. I understand I wasn't in downtown phoenix and perhaps the local clientele expects this sort of place when dining out for pizza, but it surely wasn't for me and I don't plan on visiting again. 

After all the shortcomings of the service, the kitchen mistake, the management, and the restaurant itself, I did actually enjoy the pizza. It was reasonably tasty, but not worth the $15+ price tag for a personal sized pizza, especially when your dining experience is super lame and uninspiring.

Humble Pie, I know you can do way better than this - I know I'm not the only person who writes of crappy experiences at this place. Apparently you've been giving bad service since you opened doors and haven't taken the hint yet.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, might I suggest delivery or perhaps Digiorno?"}
{"text":"I like the pizza but I go for the chopped salad. It's loaded with salami, turkey, and mozzarella cheese in a tasty vinaigrette. I am slowly working my way through the pizza menu here as they quite the selection of possibilities. I have tried the basics; margarita, cheese, pepperoni, and the different ones such as the prosciutto and goat cheese. I'm a fan of chewy pizza crust so I find myself loving their crust. 

The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. Service is generally very efficient. Thursday night is date night and they offer a great deal that includes an appetizer to share, salad and a pizza. It is more than enough food for 2."}
{"text":"First time at this location, got there at 4:00 for early dinner, very noisy with dozen people at the bar. Meat lovers pizza was too salty. Vegetable salad good."}
{"text":"Used the Groupon deal so decided to check this place out. Got the Caesar salad which was filling but very cheesy so keep that in mind when ordering but was very delicious and fresh with cuts of celery in it too. 

Tried to traditional Margherita pizza which was not bad, had the crispiness of a coal oven pizza but the sauce was very tangy, lacked the fresh mozzarella taste and they shred the basil and didn't put much on. 

Server was nice, helpful and accommodating but keep in mind it's a more expensive pizza option and not one to go to if you just want a quick slice/bite. They have a good lunch option like salad and pizza for around $11"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and am never disappointed.  They have great lunch specials... you can choose from a  pizza + soup or salad or a sandwich + soup or salad for $8.95.  Today I chose the Roasted Mushroom pizza with house-made mozzarella,pancetta, green onion + a chopped salad... so yummy!  I have also had the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage pizza with roasted fennel, house-made mozzarella,
tomato sauce.  Like i said ... never been disappointed:)  the service is always great too.  So go check it out!:)"}
{"text":"Three of us stopped by Humble Pie on Friday, March 28 at around 4 pm.  There were quite a few people on the patio, but we decided to sit inside.  There were only a couple of tables filled inside.  We ended up sitting at a table next to a high-top table in front of the kitchen.  I thought it a bit strange that the whole high-top table was filled with unfolded napkins and tableware.  There was a waitress sitting there putting the silverware in the napkins and folding them.  I thought this was a bit strange, being right in front of everyone.  A little bit later, I saw her take a bite of pizza.  Upon watching her a bit closer, I saw that she was actually taking a bite of pizza and then going back to handling the silverware and folding napkins.  This certainly was not the most appetizing.  A couple of minutes later, another waiter came out with food, sat down next to her (and the silverware and napkins) and proceed to eat his food!  About 15 minutes later a gentleman came into the dining room and talked to both of them.  I assume that he was either the manager or owner, because he was telling them that a VIP was coming on Saturday, and they were not to post anything about it on Facebook.  He then proceeded to sit at the bar with a drink and talk to the bartender.  We felt like we were in the middle of a employee party and they forgot to tell us.  As we were sitting only three feet away, we really didn't feel comfortable commenting about what we were eating or even talking among our selves.  I had the Grilled BLT sandwich.  The bacon was very smoky and tasty.  I was surprised that the toasted sourdough bread that was used came to the table and was actually cold.  I don't know if my plate was finished before the rest of the order, but I was expecting at least a warm, toasted piece of sourdough bread.  

I had previously eaten at the Humble Pie on 7th Street and was very impressed with their facility.  I was disappointed with my experience at this location.  I believe the preparation of the silverware and napkins should be done away from guests and definitely not when the person preparing them is taking a bit of pizza."}
{"text":"It's been quite awhile since I've been here. What is that smell? Why is it so hot? Do the owners live in Phoenix and know how hot it is? I'm giving 3 stars because the staff and service was great even in those working conditions."}
{"text":"Had a Strawberry Gorgonzola Salad here recently - as salads go it was good, fresh and had the right amount of toppings and dressing.  Served in a reasonable amount of time and staff person was very friendly and kept me entertained while I waited for salad.  Can't comment on rest of food but location seemed busy."}
{"text":"Humble Pie at Desert Ridge is GREAT!  This one is much closer to my home.  I was hoping that because they are run by the same company they would be similar.  The difference is night & day.  The Happy Valley location is so poorly run I will never return.  The were 4 young women as hostesses but only one bartender.  The wait staff was very over loaded.  The bar area was too small. The crowd was very good for the 1st week of opening, but the service will have to improve dramatically to keep them coming back."}
{"text":"Sooo uh. What is the big deal with this place? 

Had a groupon which I bought (10 for 20) and went here with my roomate. Pizzas are 13-14$ so 2 of them would put us over the groupon. Was there at happy hour and drinks were 4$ for specialty drinks and appetizers were half off. 

Ordered a lemoncello margarita which was awful, it tasted like sweet and sour mix that was filled 70% with sour mix and then had 30% more sour mix poured on top. BLEH. After my drink arrived the server comes up and lets me know that the appetizer and my drink are not happy hour price because im using a groupon. I tell him to hold the appetizer as its 8$ instead of 4$, but since i've drank some of my drink feel bad about sending it back....turned around the sour mix drink was 8$ instead of 4$...DOH!. 

Ok enough with the sucky nickle and dime stuff...on to the food and taste. 

I had the Prosciutto and pear pizza and my roomate had pepperoni, both were good but not amazing. Not what I expect from a $14 personal pizza. If I had a choice between this place or a place like Pizzaria Bianco or The Parlor I would never go here again. 

Oh well, that is what Groupon is for right? trial and error? Hopefully I can save someone the trouble of coming here."}
{"text":"Too long to get food, it is supposed to be fast, after all how much time do you have in an airport lounge? super expensive, bad service . Not recommended avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"This has to be the WORST place I could have eaten on my way home. Stopped in while waiting for a flight with my friends and two of us ordered burgers they didn't ask how I wanted it cooked which should have been my first red flag so I asked the waitress are they only cooked one way she said she doesn't know, I said can I have it medium she say \"I'll see\" well my other friend ordered a pizza which is in their name so you would think it would be good right? WRONG! The crust was burnt, she tried to eat the parts that weren't and couldn't finish it was obviously bad because they gave her a discount and she didn't even ask, if you knew it was bad why serve it!?? As for our burgers.... I mean obviously not fresh patties I got through a third of it and the greasy tasting fries and our stomachs started to hurt. Then the waitress after we asked for checks gave us these card machines didn't mention how to use them and when I gave her cash she just tossed my change on the table. She had the nerve to have an attitude with US!! We were disgusted. Needless to say she got not tip. We were just shocked and to top it off 2 of us came home to our families with our stomachs hurting us sooo bad!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm all about Chicken Wings and they do have delicious Chicken Wings. Wings were tasty and had a spicy taste even though I ordered the regular ones. It paired quite nicely with a Malbec. I was told I could sit where ever we liked so I picked a table furthest from the performing musician. He was very talented with a great sound but was far too loud. Tamra and I will definitely return soon. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I go to Humble Pie on a regular basis for happy hour.  The mini pizzas and appetizers on the menu are great!  Great drink prices also.  There are great daily specials and service is always attentive.  Zero complaints about this restaurant.  Have been there many times and will be back many many more."}
{"text":"Great local hangout. Lots of regulars. Nice patio, good bar, great service. The pizza is always good and they do a great burger."}
{"text":"I should note that I've not eaten in the restaurant, so this review only applies to the food and take-out service.  But, great pizzas!! Mac and Cheese is good, not great. Take out service is speedy and organized.

Really great pizzas and a great menu (lots of options)."}
{"text":"First we were seated and then it took close to 20 mins. for someone to even acknowledge we were seated. When the waiter actually came he had nothing to use to write own our order. He had to borrow my pen. Then HE STOLE MY PEN, and I never got it back. The food was bland and not very flavorful. There were no gluten free options. When I asked for garlic powder it was like I asked him for the moon. He didn't think they had any, so he went to go check, but he never even came back. The bill was so expensive and no alcohol was purchased. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The bathrooms were dirty and smelled of burnt crust. Coincidentally our crust was burt as well."}
{"text":"Well, I will tell you one thing, they got the name right. They have PLENTY to be humble about here.

So, once when I was a kid, I was baking a frozen pizza and forgot to remove the cardboard it was shrink-wrapped to before I put it into the oven.  When i took that pizza out of the oven, I took a bite into it - cardboard and all.  THAT crust was better than the crust on the pizza I had at this Sky Harbor location this morning.

I opted for the plain cheeze - the standard by which I measure all pizza joints. My twelve bucks bought a 9 inch pizza with burned cheese, hardly any sauce, and yes, a crust that could only be described as rimmed cardboard, in tgxture, taste, and mouth feel. 

This was my first visit to a humble pie, and after the experience today I doubt I'll give the chain another shot. I for darn sure won't eat at the Phoenix Airport location for any reason.

Oh, did mention they only had one pizza oven and that it would take 30 minutes until my pizza was ready?  Well that's ok because the cashier didn't either!

PM me and I'll tell you what I really think.
One star for not poisoning me."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Humble Pie... even though it was take-out. Ordered three pizzas, the Organic Local Vegetable, Margherita and the the Wild Mushroom (w/o pancetta) and was very underwhelmed. 3 stars for the bubbly crust, but honestly deserves 2, if that, for toppings and sauce. I couldn't understand what was local about the Organic Local Vegetable pizza, as there were a few onion slices, Mexican squash and red bell pepper. I will be trying other pizza options other than Humble Pie when craving decent pizza."}
{"text":"I've avoided yelping this place for a reason; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the Hilton Village. The food is horrible, the  diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in SDL I cannot figure out for the life of me why certain people and bloggers can claim this as some of the best pizza in the Valley. Sub-par food, service and experience in both locations."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Humble Pie for a while, and as luck would have it this weekend I was in the right place at the right time and we decided to stop in. 

Rumors are true, everything is delicious. We shared the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was flavorful, light, and summery. Then we split the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage pizza. It was flavorful, spicy, and delicious. I will definitely be back to Humble Pie when I need a pizza fix."}
{"text":"Fresh, good, affordably priced, good service. We had a good time. I had the butternut squash soup and should have asked if it was savory or sweet. 
It was sweet with just a little too much cinnamon. I was wanting savory. 
We had the fig and prosciutto, SOP, and the sausage pizza. 
S.O.P. Was by far the best."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love eating here - their pizza is absolutely delicious! Very unique offerings (like a BLT pizza, they even have one with eggs!). We try to order something different every time we go, and we have never been disappointed. 

Oh - and the wine!! They have a great list with all price ranges - and the staff is very knowledgeable to help you pick out the perfect bottle. They also have a good beers on tap.

It's the perfect spot for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"I would have enjoyed Humble Pie so much more if my initial experience walking through their door hadn't been being talked down to by their hostess.  We were there with several friends for birthday lunch after some ice skating next door.  The place was all but empty, but she wouldn't seat us because we didn't have a reservation and there were 2 large reservations coming in about 2 hours.  So, you can't seat a party of 8 right now because in 2 hours you have two big tables coming in?!  Excuse me?!  We made her seat us anyway and she was all but nice about it.  

Once we were past that, our waiter was much much much more friendly, so that saved it along with the yummy food.  

We had the tempura friend green beans which were fairly tasty, but not nearly as sumptuous as the french fries topped with parsley, garlic, lemon zest, pecorino cheese, chili flakes and garlic aioli.  They were like eating Lays, once you eat one, you just can't stop.

The pizza was just so so to me though.  Once you eat a place like Pomos downtown, it's hard to think of any other pizza as worthy."}
{"text":"Excellent. Pizza was yummy! Our server was friendly, kind, and worked very hard to keep all 7 of our drinks filled at all times. We enjoyed the wings, crispy green beans, toasted ravioli, and the olives for an appetizer. We also had the apple crisp, donuts, and cookie pizza for dessert. The pizzas...we had BLT, Meat Lovers, Organic Veggies, and the Fig and Proscuitto. All were excellent, unique, and served piping hot. We had a range of ages (2 to 48) at the table and everyone was very happy with the food. I'm very much looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The moment I sat down at the bar the bartender, Jack, asked for my name and called my by my name the entire time. It made the atmosphere feel real friendly as if I were a regular at a local bar. The pizza I ordered tasted amazing, I really enjoyed the mozzarella they used on their pizzas.  I will defiantly stop here the next time I'm flying out of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We found this place based on Groupon, and thank goodness!

It was a little hard to find at night, tucked away in the back of a mostly dark shopping center. However, once we found it, we were seated right away in a cute place that wasn't too frou-frou, nor too relaxed. Perfect for a middle of the week date night.

The bruschetta was so so. I liked the caprese better than Postino's (although not a huge fan of the halved cherry tomatoes) and wasn't a huge fan of the tomato jam, although it wasn't bad.

We shared a small veggie salad - delicious! It was very different, with all sorts of tasty veggies in it. As a vegetarian, it's always nice to find *real* salads with lots of vegetables, instead of the oh-so-common lettuce/tomato/carrot combos.

The best part of the night? The pizza. Now, my partner is from NY, and so were my parents. Usually, I like NY pizza, the real stuff, the end. But when it comes to interesting topping combos, I'm happy to try wood burning oven pizza, and it was soooo worth it. The one we got had potatoes, leeks and gorgonzola on it. What with the apps, splitting one between the two of us was sufficient, but I wished we'd had more to take home.

The service was right on point - both our water and iced tea glasses were always full, our server had excellent suggestions when we asked for them, and we were left alone enough to have good conversation without feeling neglected. Win.

Would be go back? Most certainly!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza with a lot of unique offerings for the combinations.  I LOVE that the menu calls out no substitutions on the pies ( I loathe picky eaters).  Also worth mentioning that they make their own olives and mozzarella cheese, which makes them a bad ass in my book.

Great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was good! The food was great and the staff was very friendly. I will most likely be coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you so much. You managed to deal with our very large group (babies and a wild child to boot) on the 22nd. We came here following a funeral and the staff were phenomenal.  

The food, as always, was terrific. The pizza's were still bubbling, the appetizers were  just different enough to be intriguing, but not so different as to make everyone turn their noses up at the options.

We were all on the patio, high tops and low tables, crammed in taking up valuable real estate and I'm sure making the poor servers nuts. But the two gentlemen taking care of us (sorry guys, I didn't get your names) were so professional and personable. If we ruffled feathers they never showed it. They were on top of the refills and were just generally great!

Thank you again for accommodating us!"}
{"text":"Classy yet casual atmosphere.  I love that there's a huge open window letting plenty of fresh air in.  I'm also pleased that they serve flights of wine.  The Chopped Salad was mostly lettuce and nothing special.  But I was sharing with friends and didn't choose it -- next time I'll try one of the other ones that sound a little more interesting.  

I'm a huge fan of wood-fired pizza and there are certainly loads of options here.   We went with the Chicken Pesto.  It had a generous serving of toppings and plenty of flavor.  It was a bit tough to eat because the crust was very thin and difficult to cut through, but good overall.  

Their special featured mac n' cheese wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  The cheese is actually more of a cream sauce - white, thin, and lacking a strong cheesy flavor.  There was a nice crunchy topping, but this just isn't my idea of mac n' cheese, and it was impossible to eat it without the gross feeling that I was consuming mouthfuls of heavy cream.  

Although I was less than thrilled with some of the food I tried this visit, I will definitely be back to try some of the other offerings.  I loved the atmosphere, the service was good, and this is just a really nice alternative to all the chains restaurants around."}
{"text":"I probably would have given this place another star but..  well...

So at first the service seemed great, the staff seemed friendly, and we were having a great time.  We ordered one express lunch which is a great deal - half salad/soup with 1 pizza that's approx. 3 in smaller than the normal size for $10 and 1 of the roasted mushroom pizza.  

The turkey chili was great - not too many beans, not too few, not too brothy, not too dry, nice chunks of turkey, etc - it was pretty perfect.  We got our pizzas very shortly after - another great thing since our appetites were appropriately whet.  

The pizzas were pretty good.  The sauce was a bit plain, pretty good quality ingredients, and good amount of topping.  However, at least half of the outer rim of both our crusts were burned.  The mushroom pizza was even worse - the bottom of the crust of 2 slices were completely charred.  

I usually comment more on the food than the service, but seems like ours took a severe nose dive after we got our pizzas.  My coke was empty for 20 min before a refill was even offered - at that point I asked for a box and the check since we'd been waiting for some attention for over half an hour.  Very disappointing after such an impressive start.  The waiter was actually helping the table right next to us and came and left without asking us if we needed anything about 5 times.  

I rate harshly on steak restaurants that overcook steaks and in this case pizza restaurants that burn crusts to an inedible state.  The standard is higher when they base their whole business on a singular food.  I can't give this place more than 3.  I will go back though because the chili was so good, I would like to give this place another shot.  Maybe I just won't get the pizza."}
{"text":"I love the environment here. Nice, mellow and a good place to relax on a date night. The garnished fries are the reason my wife and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Worth a visit...pizza crust had nice bite...fresh toppings....caprese salad was delicious"}
{"text":"I was shocked at how big this location is (when compared to the tiny spot they have in Downtown Phoenix).  It was almost full and the servers were run ragged due to being short staffed, poor dears, but they fit us in.  

We had to wait, but they warned us that would be the case, and we were happy to talk and be on a date (with kids, it is rare).

The server was excellent, the bartender picked up the slack by coming from behind the bar to get drink orders, and once the order was in, the meal came out fast, hot and perfect.

I will happily go back."}
{"text":"I do like this place--the service is friendly and the atmosphere is great.  The food was good--we had pizza and pasta.    I did enjoy it, i would go again, and everyone in the group was complimentary of their food/service.  I remember that I thoroughly loved the decor and felt that it was a fun place to go."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of humble pie, they have delicious pizzas with a variety of toppings, cool atmosphere, great specials, their salads are fresh and delicious. It's such a great little neighborhood joint. Their lunch express cannot be beat, you can get any pizza and a salad for 9.95. I love the fig & prosciutto with goat cheese and the wedge salad."}
{"text":"After a quick 3hr round of golf, an ice cold Raj IPA from four peaks, Sicilian pizza and BLT pizza hit the spot perfectly. The telltale sign for tasty pizza for me is crust and sauce.  This place gets really high marks for both, in fact the crust is just darn good and chewy. 

Tempura green beans were a really nice surprise as well. Probably my second favorite place for appetizer/side dish veggies after The Grind. 

Service was spot on, atmosphere is way more fun than the previous Treinte Cinque(granted I never got to this location when it was The Living Room).  

Now you may think we're getting a tad saturated with pizza places (cibo, Bianco, brick, oreganos, Zpizza, mama Mia, aiellos's, parlor, et al.), As do I, but this place is top tier and stays in the rotation."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch this weekend.  I got their 1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich combo.  There aren't as many sandwich options as I would have liked so I tried the chicken one.  It was ok but not memorable.  A real piece of grilled chicken (not sliced/processed stuff) and some peppers.  It was ok.  The bread was good though.  For my salad I got the wedge and it was excellent.  Crisp and creamy just the way I like it.

Also, at about 8-9 bucks per meal it is a relative bargain.  I will return."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Humble Pie. The new location opened at the previous Market Bistro site (we really miss Market Bistro!).The new site looks nice, clean, and the staff was friendly. 

Unfortunately the food was a let down. We did take out tonight, we arrived within the instructed 15 mins yet the pizza was cold after a brief 2min drive home. 

I noticed the box was light, I found out there was a good reason too, there wasn't much pizza there. We tried the margherita, it's thin and small (I think they all the same size), not much ingredients on it, and there was too much end crust ( i.e. not enough ingredients on it).   

The salad was good but pricey for what it was.

We'll try them again, maybe do the sit-down and give them an ear full. The name suggests pizza is their strong point but the pizza menu was lacking for us. They have a pizzuki (pizza cookie desert) but they told us it isn't available for takeout. Odd as Oreganos and others are able to make that happen.  Oh well...

I hope they do better than what we experienced otherwise I have a bad feeling about their chance for success."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for breakfast. A woman came, sat beside me, and was waited on almost immediately. I glanced around to see additional people sitting at the bar with same immediate service. The waitress returned to the woman beside me to present her with a beverage, and refused to acknowledge my presence. It's as if I wasn't there, which is why I left and will never return. The food is generally bad enough in airports, and no one should be treated that way."}
{"text":"Still a 5 star, still amazing.  Go early or you will have to park on the street.  The parking is my only gripe.

I go at least once every 2 weeks for lunch.  It is worth the hassle of parking."}
{"text":"Not even sure the purpose of this place being open early in the morning for breakfast.  I guess this is a bit of a live review because I just finished eating.  First of all my waitress was very nice and relatively attentive.  Probably knew the breakfast food was trash.  

I ordered the humble breakfast (2 eggs, sausage [small, wtf], fruit, potatoes, toast).  For some reason they only carry tabasco, makes me wonder where we're at.  But this isn't 1950s South Carolina.  We're in Phoenix, a Mexican Food Mecca.  That means, even if you're a pizza joint you have salsa at breakfast, or at least a Tapatio, I prefer Cholula.  Getting into the coffee, it was $3.29, it was a .50 coffee at best.  Tasted just like sludge and I'm not sure you could give it a name but it's the Biplane Blend apparently.  Now onto the eggs...Did I get the last of the baked pan?  These were not fresh and they were barely edible.  I guess I'll just go for the burrito at the fast-mex spot two places away next time.

But, what saves this from being a one was the waitress, like I said, she tried hard."}
{"text":"Our waitress was attentive and did a good job serving us.  

The food was not the greatest.  My husbands pizza was okay, but I had the chicken sandwich with a side salad.  The white bread came out  of the kitchen burned, charred black, the bread on the underside of the sandwich was the worst, not edible.  They made me another, which was better, but way overpriced for what was served.  The salad was just some field greens with a little ranch dressing on it, nothing else.

We won't be back, but if the kitchen can send out a burned sandwich looking like that one did, they obviously don't care"}
{"text":"I had a late lunch here recently and while the food was great, as usual, the service was a bit lacking.  I arrived at 12:50 pm and no one was there to seat me and no one approached until the telephone started ringing and a man rushed up to answer it and take a pizza order, all while I stood there unacknowledged.  I guess the way to get noticed at Humble Pie is to call.

The server forgot to bring my companion's water and I had to ask for silverware and a napkin.  My companion asked for hot pepper for her pizza but it was never delivered.  After the food came, she got up and got the pepper for herself.  In general, we just didn't feel that the restaurant was paying that much attention to us.  

Getting poor service at a late lunch is something has happened to me before at various restaurants (e.g., Bistro 24 at the Ritz Carlton; Arizona Biltmore) and I wonder if the staff sort of \"lets down\" after the lunch rush and late diners don't get much attention.  I'm not sure.  

Would I come back here?  Yes, probably, because the menu is good."}
{"text":"Certainly the worst pizza I've had in recent memory. Horrible service, staff are mingling about taking forever and the woman working the cash register had no idea."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this place. Always fun trying new places. The pizza was good but you could tell the kitchen must of been busy because items on the pie were not evenly distributed. Some slices were lacking ingredients. THE SERVICE not good at all. Dropped food off at table and ran away. So I went to get cheese & peppers for us. Before we were done eating another waitress came to our table and took them saying that they needed them back because they were short on them. Unfortunately, the pizza was not good enough to endure the bad service again. Bummer. Love the name of this place."}
{"text":"Live across the street in Kierland and have been coming here periodically for a couple of years now due to convenience and the fact it was generally \"reliable\", if unspectacular.  But I echo the comments of recent posters when I say the place has gone DOWN HILL recently.  The staffing and lack of management is a joke.  Last few times we've tried it it's literally been a couple of kids and a \"pseudo bartender\" running around the restaurant aimlessly like chickens with their heads cut off.  It's a total crapshoot when anyone will come over to your table to serve you, and when they do it can take FOREVER to get drinks and food back!  I don't blame the kids so much as I do ownership/management for apparently not giving a rats *** about customer service anymore.  That, and the place is overpriced for what you get (and chintzy, we were charged 2 bucks unannounced for a \"split plate fee\" to cut a stinkin burger in half).  Love supporting local joints but WILL NOT BE BACK until they get new ownership/management and clean up their act."}
{"text":"Honestly, don't bother. We came for breakfast before our flight and the food and drinks were terrible. Our breakfast burritos were COLD, gross, and had no joke one crumble of sausage. The potatoes were also cold, but had zero seasoning and the fruit bowl was a joke. We ordered two drinks each, a Bloody Mary and mimosa, the Bloody Mary's were horrible- how does one even mess that up!?. The mimosas were fine except the orange garnish that were filled with seeds (I can't be the only one who thinks drink garnishes should be seedless) The only reason why in giving two stars is the services was good. It's too bad this the only spot on this side of the terminal for a pre flight drink."}
{"text":"Came in late last week, NOT ONCE did we feel rushed to eat because it was close to closing. Service and food great. Nice waiter (wish I remembered his name). Will be going back..Nice atmosphere too...."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while now. Hit them up for lunch this week and it was great! The service was good and the food was amazing! I suppose I should have had pizza, but the sourdough burger was calling my name. I didn't go wrong with that choice! I don't eat a lot of red meat, but when I want a burger, I want a GOOD burger, and Humble Pie was up to the challenge. The fries were really good too :-)"}
{"text":"Four stars for the amazing burger Ginger recommended and 5 stars for the great service.  Ginger made it a lot of fun to kill time before a flight.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I found their deal on Groupon ($11 for $20 worth of food) and decided to try them out. 

My first impression made me worry a little. The hostess didn't bother to look 2 ft. out of the door when she called us to be seated, and crossed us off the list (my boyfriend was in crutches so we were sitting on the bench outside...there is no indoor waiting area). However she got us a table fairly quickly when I went up and asked what happened to my name.

Our waitress was nice and the food came out quickly. My boyfriend and I both ordered pizza. It was good, but not anything special. A little soggy like other reviews had described. I'd like to go back and try their pasta dishes one day, but other than that, I would probably not return."}
{"text":"I know it's in an airport, but I absolutely did not care for this pizza. The pizza was very expensive, and there are only a few options. I asked for a veggie pizza and the lady told me they didn't have that, so I had to get the SOP and opt for no sausage. The pizza set me back $16 and wasn't filling. If you want a pizza with toppings, you have to pay $2 per topping, even on a personal pizza. I know the workers don't set the prices but the service wasn't that great either. They make your pizza, then call your name out to get it, but if you're not listening really close, you won't hear them call you. 

Also very few seating options. We had to sit at a high bar type table, which is okay but if you can't sit at a bar due to limited mobility, keep that in mind that there are few booths, so you might want to take your pizza to a chair near your gate to eat it."}
{"text":"There is no better lunch spot with kids on a Sunday afternoon then Humble Pie. Kids eat free, food is awesome and they have incredible lunch specials. Total bill, less than $30 for a family of 5. Amazing! Hit up church then come here for a great family meal and experience."}
{"text":"These guys are horrible, I came here on a Sunday night about a month ago. I ordered a meat lovers pizza and I guess all of their pizza's are the same size.. The pizza was the size of a small/medium thin and the toppings looked generic.. The cashier told me it was 18 bucks and change, and there was only like 6 slices, and they were thin... I handed her a twenty and she said she didn't have change...... ok that's weird... probably because you guys don't make enough business. I told her keep the change and I looked at the other waitresses and bartenders had zero personality or customer service. It looked as if they didn't even want to work there..... Stay away from Humble Pizza.... I will never ever go back.... Period. I've had better pizza like Digiorno's and Little Caesars.... and it was 5 bucks... Again stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been twice for lunch in the past 7 days. Their lunch special of any 10\" pizza and half a salad or bowl of soup is a lot of incredible food. Everything tastes so fresh. A big plus is their service is attentive and FAST. Love love love it here."}
{"text":"Ironically we decided to try this place not for the pizza, but specifically to try the pasta dishes, as I am always looking for a nice place (live in south phx, options for Italian slim). Sat outside, which is another fav of mine. Yes parking was a bit full...there are 4-5 eateries in immediate area so they all compete for spaces....but found a spot easy enough a couple buildings down. Wait staff were absolutely delightful, friendly and helpful in selecting wine choice and meal. Our pasta dishes were great, not huge selection, but what they had was fresh and very tasty. We are a fan and will go back. Anxious to try the mac and cheese. We also tried the olives....yum a nice start with a good bottle of wine (which was 1\2 price!). We were seated immediately with no wait...roughly around 6:30."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza! Also love the Kids Eat Free deal we got! Sat on the patio and had great service! Will definitely eat here again when we come back to Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 17, of which 8 were children. The chopped salad and wood fired pizza were delish! The waiter was beyond GREAT with the kids, and suggested a kids table so the adults could chat. With the \"Kids Eat Free\" on Sundays, I can see this becoming a regular after church outing for our group. Only suggestion is a changing table - if possible in the tiny bathroom. We are regulars at the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"Fried Green Beans! Friendly service. Yummy pizza flavor combos. 

The bruschetta' are a must have."}
{"text":"Eat here about once every 10 days. Great neighborhood spot. Always enjoy the pizzas and the chopped salad. Same servers for a long time and always great friendly service."}
{"text":"I think this location forgot they were at the airport. If you eat here plan on the food taking 25 minutes. I waited for 20 minutes for my food and the main chef came out of the kitchen and didn't even apologize for the long delay. My original waitress was out to lunch and never came back to see me until I got up to leave and then they rushed the food over. Fortunately there was a nice waitress that filled up my coffee and did her best around a bunch of people that honesty need to find new jobs. 

Management needs to help this place out and help the 5 guys in the kitchen cook some food. Bad representation of a pretty good brand."}
{"text":"They have the best shrimp pizza. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. The service is always great and if you need a gluten free pizza they can deliver. Never disappointed anytime I take the family for a lunch or dinner. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"On my ongoing quest for great pizza - I tried this place out while visiting my family in AZ.

This place gets 3.5 stars for the pizza, and 5 stars for its hospitality, atmosphere, and Bloody Mary. 

Our waiter was so nice, you could tell he had a special place in his heart for Humble Pie.

The pizza was real good - but my stars are comparing it to all the great pizza I have tried around the globe - so for AZ... go give it a try!

Their Bloody Mary was AWESOME. It had basil and mozzarella cheese floating around it in - yum. Also, if you go, you have to get the garlic fries. They were cooked perfectly crispy, with just the right combo of garlic and cheese.

We had my 3 little cousins with us that range in age from 12 - 7.  Great for kids - they eat free on Sunday too! It was an overall great place for a nice relaxed sunday late lunch with the family."}
{"text":"The drunk regulars at this place on a Friday night are ridiculous. Over-serve much? You might have more repeat customers if you didn't have obnoxious drunk lunatics lining your bar."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials - Any pizza and salad combo for $8.95! Portions are decent sized and the white pizza with truffle oil is great. Great service and nice patio."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but food was mediocre. There were 3 of us and we all had pizza. Not the best pizza and not the worst. But it was way overpriced. We had 3 very small pizzas, two pops, water, desert and a salad and our bill was $80!!!! And that was with a Groupon. Ridiculous. This was our first time and our last time. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food - chopped salad is my favorite.  Sometimes the place gets a little loud, but otherwise food is very consistent, and attentive staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Humble Pie a few times and enjoy both the food and the drinks. They also offer good happy hour specials. My favorite drink is their red sangria. They also have a good Caesar salad and the pizza's have all been tasty. Its a smaller restaurant inside, but the service is always great and the patio offers additional seating."}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed that we didn't get a great new pizza place in our area. The celery and pepperoni pizzas were tasteless and undercooked.  Didn't know you could mess pizza up so badly."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! I have been to this location a few times and have had great experiences. The service is wonderful, the appetizers we've tried have been pretty good, but the pizza is delicious! This last visit we had the meat lovers pizza and it was SO good! We've also tried the chocolate chip pizza cookie and the injectable doughnut holes and both are really tasty. They have great specials during happy hour and date night, so do a little research before you go if you're looking for a deal."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch last week and we enjoyed the express lunch with a strawberry and gorgonzola salad and a meatball pizza.  It truly was \"express\" as the food was served fresh and quick - bonus!  The salad and pizza were both amazing and it was nice to have a mix to choose from.  Nice atmosphere with a pet friendly patio too (next time), great service and tasty food."}
{"text":"Horrible service! As soon as we were seated our Male server said, \"Let me guess, you have a groupon. All my tables have groupons tonight & it's annoying.\"  Hmmm there goes your tip!  We Called the manager the next day & she didn't seem to care. We Won't be returning!  And if you don't want the groupons, DONT OFFER THEM!"}
{"text":"Pizza like Italy. The reviews for the surrounding areas are for chain restaurants that can't compare. Really Phoenix? The caprese salad to die for with real baratta cheese and oh my the fresh Italian bread, Olive oil evokes memories of Italy. The reason they get three stars is bad service because the food is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered using GrubHub because I'm laid up with the Flu and was tired of the hotel food. I had the Minestrone soup and Fig and Prosciutto White Pizza. Both were very good despite them being cold. I've never used GrubHub before and might again in a pinch but I will definitely eat at Humble Pit again."}
{"text":"What a great place!  I have driven by this place so many times but always forget about it.  I went on a weekend when it wasn't horribly busy.  The space is cool and has a modern vibe.  I had the lunch special which was a salad or soup and a 9in pizza of any kind.  I had the minestrone and the meat lovers pizza.  Great pizza and great flavors!  I would for sure come back here again!"}
{"text":"I love Humble Pie. I am in walking distance and due to its convenient location, my boyfriend and I often dine there. We've never had an issue with service and have tried, with pleasure, almost everything on the menu.

They have a great happy hour, featuring half priced drinks and food options for $2-$5. The happy hour runs everyday from 3-6, which works out well for our schedules since we usually want a late afternoon snack on Saturday or early dinner on Sunday. (If you don't like kids or crowds, I advise getting there early on Sunday night as it's their Kids Eat Free night and it gets loud and busy.)

We get to-go food a lot. Last week, we abandoned our usual pizza order (Pizza Margherita) for an impressive steak salad. The steak was very lean and prepared to a perfect medium rare. It had really nice flavor, as well. The salad was a mix of romaine and arugula, which paired well with the steak. It was served with an absolutely delicious caper-mustard vinaigrette. 

I'll keep updating this as I eat there a lot!"}
{"text":"Food quality was decent (fries were the shoe string type so it felt like a lot of work to eat but they tasted good). Selection as expected at an airport location. Only things that took away from me he experience was the lack of understanding that people are in a rush obviously to catch flights. So when people ask for their check have a sense of urgency. And then the up-sell by the servers was a bit excessive. I completely understand add-one and increasing average ticket. But every single thing anyone ordered was followed with an additional purchase suggestion. Customer: \"Coffee\" server: \"with Bailey's?\" Customer: \"just the check\" server: \"sure you wouldn't like another beer?\" (Not exaggerated)"}
{"text":"This is the not place to go if you have just 2 1/2 hours before your flight (well, in my experience).  I ordered the strawberry gorgonzola with chicken salad and my co-worker got the patty melt with a side salad.  It took approximately 40 minutes to get our food.  There was a table next to us where they asked for to go boxes even before their food came and they were seated before us!  

Finally when our food came, we swallowed everything.  I remember it was good but not good when you're eating in a rush.  

I will probably go there again only if I have 4 hours before my flight.  In translation, NEVER."}
{"text":"Come here often for lunch. Always great service and good food. Killer BLT and chop salad is the best."}
{"text":"Thursday evening and I found myself waiting for a flight in The Phoenix airport.  Pizza sounded good so I stopped at Humble Pie.  They have a nice selection of personal size pizzas (that will feed 2 people - I only ate half of my 10\"), and appetizers.  They have Pepsi products so I got Mt. Dew!  The food was good, although I don't think I would get the egg pizza again - a little salty for my taste.  I also got the toasted ravioli- 4 very large cheese ravioli with some marinara sauce- very good!  The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Pretty surprising for an airport restaurant! We had some time to kill in between flights and grabbed a beer and a few pizzas. Service was fast and friendly. Yes, the place is a bit noisy but it is in a crowded section of the airport. Pizza was good -- we got the mushroom pizza and the meatball pizza. Both piping hot with fluffy crust and tasty ingredients. $12-15 for a 10\" pizza given typical airport overcharging seems like a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"[[This is a review for the 7th Street location]]

Love, LOVE, LOVE the food! We got a pizza and ceasar salad to split and it was just enough food for the two of us. The restaurant was small and quiet and there was plenty of room/seating for a Friday night. I ordered a special martini and it was QUITE strong. The recipe stated that the drink would have cinnamon [it was a holiday drink] but the cinnamon turned out to be goldschlager [ew.] Our food came out very fast and was just so good!

Now, the reason why I gave it a two out of five;

When we walked into the restaurant my friend and I stood in the doorway for a good five minutes before we were approached. The woman stated that we could sit anywhere and our server would be with us soon. About ten minutes later, the same woman came back and stated that she would be taking our drink order but our real server would be with us soon. Ten minutes later, the same woman came back with our drinks and then took our food order. My friend ordered a white wine and she came back with a red. When it was time to go, we put our forks and napkins on our plates, indicating that we were done. It took another ten minutes to get our check.

We left a four dollar tip. Never, in my life, have I left a tip under five dollars.
It was well deserved. 

I will be eating the food from humble pie again, but I will be taking it home to REALLY enjoy it."}
{"text":"After hiking Camelback mountain for the first time and almost making it to the top before my fear of heights took over and sent me back down the trail, I decided I was in the mood for pizza. Not just Domino's sloppy pizza, but a pizza that made you feel gourmet, a little healthier than the usual stuff. Well, we turned to google maps and came across this tasty little joint. From the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell that the interior is surprisingly updated and clean.

Me, my fiance, and my daughter sat at a table right in front of the big screen TV over the bar to watch the Cards game. It was happy hour, so we had $2.50 draft beers, and ordered their appetizer fries, complete with ranch and nacho cheese dip. They were uh-mazing. I ate so many of the fries that I was almost too full by the time they brought out our pizza. I went with the chicken pesto and tomato pizza (DELISH) and my man went with a build your own creation, similar to a chicago style pizza. The kid ate free (bonus). We had plenty of leftover pizza to take home with us, which, BTW, it heats up nicely and tastes great the next day.  

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because they don't have pineapple as a topping choice. I have been eating pineapple on my pizza since I was 12, so this was disappointing. But, it did force me to try something new, in which I was impressed with. As for gourmet-I would say a lot better than a run of the mill pizza joint. The dough isn't greasy, and the topping combinations/themes were unique (i.e. prosciutto & pear), but also classic (i.e. pepperoni). Would definitely go back with the family."}
{"text":"Let's face it travelers, most airport food sucks. Not Humble Pie. What's their story? PHOENIX has invited local restaurants to open mini caf√©s by most gates. Humble Pie offers pretty good food selections. And surprise! It's also tasty. Even local micro brews from Four Peeks. Recommend you stop here for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I made a reservation through open table and we were seated immediately on the patio which I was hoping for. The menu had many tempting choices. We selected the vegetable salad, strawberry salad and artichoke pizza. The kids had a cheese and a sausage pizza. Our servers were quick and attentive and the salads and pizza were absolutely delicious! The Crispy, chewy crusts and fresh salad ingredients were terrific. We were in and out in less than an hour which was perfect because we wanted to get back to watch playoff hockey. Great place!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place for quite a while and the opportunity finally afforded itself. The parking lot was full, which we took as a good sign and lots of happy people enjoying their food inside & outside. Lively atmosphere, well appointed interior. The staffer who greeted us said she had 3 available seats at the bar or a high-top (if we didn't want outside). We told her there were 4 of us, so we'd take the high-top. She then brought us 3 menus and proceeded to take the 4th place setting away. We reminded her once again that there were 4 of us. This does not bode well.

We ordered drinks, which took quite a while to arrive. We kept seeing the server taking food/drinks to other tables. Finally, another server brought us our drinks. The first server returns to take our order. We had decided to try the garlic fries appetizer - she asked if we wanted to place our dinner order, too. Sure, we said, as long as the appetizer and entrees don't come out together. No problem.Again we waited...and waited. Then, low and behold, our entrees arrive- served by yet again a different staff person (may have actually been the one who brought our drinks, I'm not sure.) I commented that I guess we weren't going to get our appetizer after all, and she was surprised & offered to take our food back to bring out the appetizer. Really??? Just leave the food and cancel the app.

Now for the food. Our order included the SOP Pizza (sausage, carmelized onion, roasted red peppers), The Egg Pizza and the Mac &Cheese. The SOP was tasty, crust was a bit soggy, though. The portion of the Mac & Cheese looked a bit small but was told it was good - not great, but good.

Overall, the service was lacking - I'm not sure a server is actually assigned to a table as it seemed new faces keep showing up at ours - very confusing. There was live music in the bar area - wasn't too fond of his music (but that's personal taste) but it was a bit loud to carry on conversation. Food was fine - again, not WOW, and for the pirce point, I would expect more.

I think the majority of the cars in the packed parking lot were for The Main Ingredient which is right next door (and has awesome food at a very reasonable price point!) Would I return? Maybe. But given other options, I'll probably go there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night around 8, because we like to skate at AZ Ice Peoria for their late-night Friday I-League. We came in just for drinks but decided to order a little bit of food anyhow. 

We straight up told our server that we were only going to be ordering small items, and he was perfectly okay with that. He was actually quite attentive and interactive with us the entire meal service, which was very pleasant considering we spend only about $20. 

We ordered their cheesy bread and the doughnut holes, and let me tell you they were both quite good! The cheesy bread came with a variety of seasoning on top: a mixture of oregano, thyme and other herbs. It came out in a timely manner and wasn't overly cheesy or seasoned. Definitely recommend. 

The highlight of our stay, though, were the doughnut holes. They're these little balls of deep fried batter covered in powdered sugar, some sort of cinnamon dust and a caramel sauce. They were absolutely delicious! Light and fluffy, yet soo good and filling. Plus, you get a HUGE portion. Like literally a huge mountain of these little gems for less than $5. Probably their best steal on the menu, even though I haven't tasted anything else. 

I'm sure we'll be back eventually to have some more of their food before late-night hockey! Five stars for food and five stars for service!"}
{"text":"I am very excited that Humble Pie will finally be moving into a location of their own soon. No more having to get up early to track down a pie in a farmers market in a field on a Saturday morning!

Plan ahead for Thanksgiving or any other major pie-eatin' holiday because the pies go quickly and you're going to want to bring one of these. It guarantees you an invite for the following year and, if you bring two, a seat at the grown-ups' table. The other guests will love these pies and they will love you by proxy."}
{"text":"Loved the luncheon special , salad was awesome, pizza was great , even the kids asked to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here about 2 weeks ago. They had just changed their menu so it was a bit confusing for the staff but that wasn't the servers fault. Super accommodating...offered us a bottle of wine half off as they were changing over to new wines. Food was good too. Not a big fan of thicker crust on pizza but the flavor was good."}
{"text":"Service experiences have been mixed:  the bartender was courteous, however, we have often been rushed.  When picking up a to-go order the hostess/cashier was clearly annoyed at my questions and rude in her responses.  For instance, why are the prices listed on the to-go menu different or less than what I am being charged?  Yes, I understand that the register is ringing them up that way and repeating that 2x doesn't make it ok.  Sometimes it's how you handle a situation that makes all the difference.  

On top of the service issues, the pizzas always look and smell great upon arrival, but they have been disappointing the last couple of times.  Great selection of toppings and variety of pizzas, HOWEVER, it does you no good when you can't taste them with wet dough.  With the last couple of pies i've had here they've been soggy despite crispy crusts.  

I also tried reheating the take-out pizzas in the oven to crisp them up but it was to no avail.  Very disappointing - it seems like they still haven't resolved their dough issues."}
{"text":"Wow. What a cool and upscale pizza place! 

If you want standard pizza and appetizers, then do not come here because this place is for those who crave a little extra. Creative and delicious pizzas (made with totally fresh ingredients) along with hardcore appetizers (do not expect your generic antipasto) make for a great dining experience. 

I went for a quiet lunch during the day and the service and food were excellent. The pizza does take some time so if you have a limited time for lunch I would not recommend this place. You might be too rushed to enjoy the food. 

At night this place seems like a fun, casual nightlife spot. Definitely a good choice if you're on a date."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the area.  Food is good, and if you live at Shade, be sure to let the waiter know, 25% off your bill."}
{"text":"First time here. We sat at the counter because the tables full. Our server was attentive until we got our appetizer (decent calamari) but then he disappeared. The bartender came around and took our pizza order. We asked several minutes later about it and were told the manager left at 6:00 because it was on the quiet side and then they got a dinner rush. 
Conclusion from first and only time here: not well managed. Not coming back bc so many other and better options."}
{"text":"While the food is good, the service is terrible.  We went on Sunday evening, when kids are supposed to be free.  We were charged for our oldest child without anyone even saying anything, and when we asked about it, they actually questioned her age.  The manager rolled his eyes when we explained that our child was 12.  Seriously?  My kids aren't even big for their ages, especially compared to many of their friends.  Ironically, our daughter wasn't even over the age limit, but even if she was, was it really worth it to lose regular customers over one $5 meal?  We had actually eaten here at least 6 times this summer, and after this experience, we will not go back.  Good call, manager... hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is a great restaurant that has several locations throughout the valley. We love to come here for happy hour because they have some great deals. They have food deals from 3pm-6pm and drink deals from 11am-6pm. We have tried a lot of their food and have never been disappointed. The only reason that I am giving it four stars  instead of five is because of service. The service is really hit or miss. Sometimes is great and other times it is awful. Our visit in January was one of the awful ones and I think it was due to being a bit understaffed on their kids eat free day, but when it takes an hour to get your check and pay it, that is just too much. We also only saw our waiter a handful of times and often had empty drinks. Past visits we have had better service, but it is never a guarantee here."}
{"text":"I love humble pie so much. Sourdough crust. Local organic vegetables. Local organic vegetable pizza, get it."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night dinner. Made reservations and arrived early to have a few drinks at the bar. I had the pomegranate martini and it was strong and delish! After our party was seated I ordered the apples and brie with fig bruschetta.. amazing! One of my friends ordered the tempura green beans and they were great! Pizza was great as well as you would expect. Friendly staff and they didn't mind our very extended stay of approx 3 hours of inappropriate girl talk. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Just not impressed, this is not our first visit to Humble Pie, parking is easy, service was more than just standard, food portions are a little on the small size, for $12 the burger should be more than quarter inch thick, pizza is better than most places, I think most of their business is in carryout. OK place for a family meal, but you don't really get your monies worth."}
{"text":"The organic Strawberry & Gorgonzola Salad with greens, candied pecans and balsamic vinaigrette hit the spot for an early morning breakfast between flights. Tasty, nutritious, filling and quick."}
{"text":"Great Pie with an atmosphere made for kicking back and enjoying a beer or three.  I've never had a bad meal here, and I think the Desert Ridge location is the best one of these around.  I haven't eaten at any of the other ones, but I can't find a bad thing to say about this establishment and its pizza so it must be the best one.  Whether you have a friend in town that you want to let in on the secret that Phoenix has some of the best pizza anywhere, or just going out with your buddies for the night, this place will never do you wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, good prices, and typically good service.  We have been here at about 8 times and only had slow service once.  Great variety of pizza and the Happy Hour specials are great."}
{"text":"We decided to have an early dinner after having a busy day.  Stopping into Humble Pie at 330 there was hardly any one there. It was happy hour so we were able to take advantage of weekend happy hour prices ...Sweet!

We started with an appetizer Tempura Green beans.  These were very fresh tasting beans and the Tempura batter was very light which was nice. The stone ground mustard dip seemed initially to be an odd pairing but actually tasted great. For our entrees we split the Veggie Salad and also a 10\" margherita pizza.  You really can't go wrong with this salad...it always delivers fresh, tasty ingredients with a light finish. We seem to be addicted to this salad with fresh jicama, white beans, green beans and more.  The pizza was good but needs something additional to match the quality of all the other margherita pizzas we've had. 

Our specialty drinks were very tasty a Humble Tea and a Blue Margarita.  Thank you to Haylie for exceptional service."}
{"text":"Long line for this place at the airport. Good sign that it's decent. I had the Traditionalist Wrap - sausage, eggs, and cheese for $7.50. It's essentially a breakfast burrito. The eggs aren't the best, but at least they weren't watery. The combo as a whole was good enough to satisfy my hunger, but the price is high. Then again, airport eateries ALWAYS increase their prices just because they can."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there in a long time, forgot how mediocre the pizza is. Very little sauce and very little cheese. But what really burns me up is that we ordered a 12\" pizza, their only size available. We got onions and sausage on only one half. But they charged us as if we had gotten the toppings on the whole thing. $2 for a skimpy amount of onions and $4 for a ridiculously skimpy amount of sausage. This on only 1/2 of a mediocre 12\" pizza mind you. This is more than good pizza places charge for a whole pizza! Definitely my last visit."}
{"text":"Always closes early no reason why horrible hey need to remove this from the airport and put something else since they like closing early !!! Smfh this place sucks"}
{"text":"Was in town for spring training.  Great spot for pizza and pasta.  Quick, fresh ingredients and great service.  Will be back next year."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with our food as well as the outstanding service we had.  Everyone was very welcoming and showed pride in there job. The food came out in a timely fashion was presented nice made to order and arived hot and fresh. Both inside and out was very clean you can also see in the kitchen and it was also looked very clean."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.  The food is always good, the the staff is awesome.  This is my \"Norm!\" kind of place (as in everyone knows my name). :-)  I usually order a Black Cherry Manhattan, which is no longer on the menu however they still make sure to stock the liqueur necessary to make it for me.  That is how much they go above and beyond.

If you like artisan pizza, you won't be disappointed.  Make sure you try the fries; parsley, garlic, cheese and aioli!"}
{"text":"We have loved this restaurant in the past.  However, the past two times we have tried to come it has been closed.  No note on the door or anything.  Both times it was within what should have been their regular business hours.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. (It's no NY or Chicago pizza, but it's decent.) The service was interesting: prompt attention by busboys and a waitress that couldn't have less of a personality. Overall I'd say it was good other than the fact that it was way too hot in there. Sorry guys - it's too early to have all of the windows open in Phoenix without turning down the air conditioning as well."}
{"text":"Had a delayed flight so hopped into the Humble Pie. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza after it was recommended by our waiter and split it with a friend. 

Pros: Atmosphere is pleasant and the service was good. Food was quick and the pizza was decent but I've had better. Nice thick bacon on the pizza. 

Cons: can't hear the airport announcements. Every few bites of my pizza the only flavor I could taste was \"burnt\" even though the pizza itself wasn't overcooked. 

Overall I'm glad I came in to fill my tummy but I probably would try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this Humble Pie quite a few times and really love the pizza. But I will not be going back after tonight. 
My friends and I were looking for a place to meet, eat good food, enjoy happy hour and each other's company. I checked Humble Pies website and it said: Thirsty Thursday happy hour drinks all night. 
So the 6 of us met there around 6pm. Ordered a round of drinks and asked our waitress about the happy hour drink menu and she said happy hour ended. We told her about what the website said and even pulled it up to show her. She said she would ask if they would honor it. About fifteen minutes later she came back and said \"He said no. It's wrong and the best he can do is have them fix the website. He's going to call them tomorrow.\" 
We all thought that was very poor customer relations. One of my friends said: Are we not important enough? 
No one came over to explain this to us. No manager, no owner, just the poor waitress. Needless to say all 6 off us agreed, we wouldn't go back.
Shame on them."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in all of Desert Ridge.  New menu, happy hour starts from open to six."}
{"text":"Great food, great service but the mixed drinks were way to strong. .Yes... I said that.  My husband couldn't even drink his but he is whimsy.  Beer, ice cold and the jalapeno bloody mary was excellent.  We tried the tempura green beans for the first time... interesting and very good. Who'd a thought?

Todd was our server and was extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised by our experience at Humble Pie! The ambience is very nice. The windows are large and there is an openness to the restaurant. In addition, it was not noisy so we were able to carry on a conversation without having to shout. The food was also very good! We had an iceberg wedge salad which was fresh and crisp and tasty. We also tried the pizza which was great! The crust and toppings were perfect! Our daughter tried the spaghetti and loved it. It was al dente and the sauce was homemade and very tasty. The service was impeccable! Our server was very attentive without being \"in the way\". And finally, the price of dinner with wine was really reasonable. We will be back. There are so many more things we want to try!"}
{"text":"I had been to one of the locations in Scottsdale for lunch at work. This time it was the new location closer to home for a Ladies Lunch with my girlfriends.

Upon my arrival the inside was pretty empty but the patio was full. When I looked at the menu I realized that they did Happy Hour everyday from 11-6....happy customer already! $5 glasses of wine.....DONE!!! Our server overheard us talking about Bloody Mary's and how we enjoyed them. Well he went and made us a shot of THEIR bloody mary and surprised us with a sample! They make theirs with Jalepeno's and they are delish!!!! Points scored with these ladies.

My girlfriends and I are usually only able to get together for lunch about once a month. So when we go, we don't like to be rushed. We were not rushed in the slightest. We let him know we were in no hurry and we were going to be there for a while. He was very good about checking on us for refills of any kind (tea, water or wine). When we finally ordered we got everything the way it was ordered.

I personally wanted to try something new so I went for the lunch special, salad and pizza. I tried their new salad Apple & Arugula. I'm a greens girl so I really enjoyed the earthy taste of the Arugula. Combined with the citrus of the Lemon Caper Vinaigrette, it was a refreshing salad. Then I got the Fig & Prosciutto pizza upon seeing someone else's review on Yelp and her mentioning how good it was. I had to try it out. No disappointing there either. It was a great combination of slightly sweet & salty pizza. Not to forget the carmelized onions. It was perfect.

On a side note, someone else's review of the pizza being \"soggy\". This is a more upscale, what I call \"fancy\" pizza. You should not expect regular \"to-go\" pizza. This is pizza eaten more in a classy way (fork & knife style) it's not the kind you pick up and eat with your hands.

I love when a place offers happy hour on the weekends too. That lets me experience more items on their menu than I normally wood. Now I'm talking more of the wine menu than the food. Although I was eyeing a few other Starters that I would have liked to have eaten. But wine by the glass gives me the options for change. I started in with the Snap Dragon Pinot Noir and never strayed from that. My two girlfriends both had a Melbec and only one of them switched to the Noir after their 2nd glass.

With my bill coming to under $30 (salad + pizza + 3 glasses of wine) before tip. We certainly are going to make this one of our regular spots for Ladies Lunch."}
{"text":"This morning I was hopeful for a descent breakfast that was quick. Now I understand they sell pizza, however their breakfast options appeared ok. I ordered a bacon and egg wrap for $9. The wrap had 1 piece of bacon and eggs. It was sad really, I basically had eggs for breakfast, certainly was a major disappointment. Won't be coming back and I travel to the Phoenix often."}
{"text":"I have to report that I just walked out of this restaurant after waiting a good 5 plus minutes for a server to show up. I was especially convinced when I looked over at the other table's greasy looking pizza. Eek! Methinks not."}
{"text":"I have being to the original Humble Pie location downtown and i was eager for a quick pie to go at the airport.  I am use to airport pricing, so I was okay with price point, the pie turned out pretty good, the crust was slightly too burnt, but the pepperoni had a nice spice to it.

My biggest compliant was my wait, I ordered my pie, than went to the restroom came back and saw the customer in front of me just get her pie, I waited patiently and saw that there were several pies in the oven going.  Than 6+ pies came out, all these were from customers who ordered after me, a set of 6+ pies went in and as they were coming out I didn't see mine's, I asked the guy baking and he didn't see my name on the tickets for the pies.  So about 12+ pizzas came out before mine's did, no this isn't an airport where people are in a hurry to catch their flights or anything important like that."}
{"text":"Humble pie is a casual family restaurant that serves up Neapolitan style pizzas, salads, soups, sandwiches and other items. This is a small but local chain with at least a half dozen locations in the metro Phoenix area. 

I have to admit I was fearful of trying this restaurant because of some of the negative reviews on Yelp but finally decided to give this restaurant a try because of the reasonable pricing and the dog friendly patio.

They offer a lunch express special. For $10.99 you can pick any soup or salad and any individual pizza so both of us went with those choices.

I started with the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. It was much nicer than I was expecting and it was made with the best tasting strawberries I tried all year. My husband had the minestrone soup and it was made with sausage that's made just for Humble Pie. My husband thought his soup was very good.

I had the margherita pizza. It looked like a gourmet pizza from any high end pizza joint. It was made with house made fresh mozzarella cheese and sprinkled with a generous amount of fresh basil. The sauce was good quality sauce. The crust was thin, light and crispy and either semolina or corn meal was applied to the bottom of the crust giving it a little extra flavor and texture. Lastly a sprinkling of oil was applied to the top. 

My husband had a similar pizza but with the Humble Pie sausage.

Not the leading pizza in the valley but a very good pizza and it was a very inexpensive lunch special since it was two courses for $10.99.

Service was above average and was friendly and very considerate to my dogs. Our server brought the dogs water to drink.

It was much better than I was expecting."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!
 LOVE IT!!!!!!!
 LOVE IT!!!!!!
 Have been wanting to check it out for some time. Got the Groupon cuz they opened one right close to home! Hurray! Can't wait to go back. Their pizza;s are THE BEST!!!!! Happy hour beers are fantastic too. Loved our waiter."}
{"text":"Was expecting way more than we got. Ordered a glass of red wine, it was refrigerated. The toasted raviolis are brought in, but the breading on the outside is house-made and severally under-seasoned. The pizza crust was so thin we couldn't even eat it New York style, and it was soggy to boot. Almost no sauce to be found on it either and almost tasted like a frozen pizza. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Fig Pizza is disgusting!  Besides taking 20 minutes and being horribly undercooked, it had this white rubber all over the top of it.  They didn't even bother to add synthetic goat cheese flavor to the rubber.  The \"pancetta\" was artificial thin sliced ham pieces soaked in that saline preservative all day.  Really yucky stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Super friendly server, very on top of things. The chopped salad was really good. Good balance of ingredients to dressing, very fresh and their homemade mozzarella was awesome. Mushroom pancetta pizza also had the fresh mozzarella too. Super warm, soft crust was so good. Clean restrooms/ dinning area. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Rushed meal at the airport waiting for our plane and we totally lucked out with getting seats at this tasty place.

Airport food is hit or miss. Mostly a miss- especially when you are close to the gates. Since this was a quick trip and there were arrival issues(ours) and TSA issues(theirs) on both legs of the flight to and from Oakland, our expectations were marginal at best.

My husband ordered the Margarita Pizza and I ordered a BLTA sans mayo with a salad instead of fries. Within minutes both meals arrived and I was impressed with the amount of delicious non-kosher bacon on my no mayo bread and the ripeness of the tomato and perfect avocado. I was pleased. The husband wolfed down his hot pizza (we were in a hurry) and didn't speak much. It wasn't until later he admitted his pizza was one of the best he had ever had, like ever.

I am pretty sure they have non-airport locations and next time we come to town, will seek them out. For now, just know- you never ever have to settle for Pizza Hut or Sbarro's again in Terminal 4."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews from my husband and I:

His comments: 
* Salad was good - we had the spinach & Gorgonzola salad. 
* Pizza was really good, but too expensive. Plus, it was the thinner type so you wouldn't expect to pay that much.
* Wait staff - not good. 
* Ambiance - pretty nice. Has a NY type of feeling.
* Too pricey to go back

My comments: 
* Salad had too much dressing. It was dripping with the balsamic stuff. I don't like soppy lettuce.
* Pizza was just ok. It was served to us fairly quickly considering that the place was packed. However, it was not hot. Plus, we had to wave our server down to ask her to heat it up. She didn't seem very happy with us and did not offer an apology for the cold pie. After all, this place is called Humble Pie. 
* Wait staff - Not good. Not very forthcoming with the menu and only seemed to be interested in getting the ordering over with.
* The staff should be humble enough to ask the customer if everything is ok after the food is served. That never happened. Even when she brought over the check we got nothing. 
* Ambiance - too loud and dark! Tables and chairs are packed tight in this place so plan to share your space with others not in your party. 
* Definitely not going back. 

We paid $34 plus tip for a small Cesar salad, pizza with three toppings, soft drink and glass of wine. Too much money for some Si's food."}
{"text":"I have been to various Humble Pie locations a total of 3 times. In my opinion, their best offer is their lunch special of salad and pizza. It is fairly priced and good eating. :)"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a friend of mine.
Atmosphere was nice nothing special, service was adequate.
Food- I ordered the steak and chicken chili (I know why that) and it was just awful. It was similar to a soup you would buy at frys grocery store where it's dumped out of a big container and heated up.
Friend had pepperoni & sausage pizza and I had a slice. Decent, wouldn't go back for mediocre quality. Not horrible just par."}
{"text":"I placed my order at Humble Pie 40 minutes before my flight was scheduled to board and continued with my order after being told it would be 10-15 minutes max. After 45 minutes my flight was midway through boarding and I was still pizza-less. I was finally told that my pizza was \"messed up\" (it had gotten stuck in the pan and then fell on the floor in an effort to get it out) and it had to be re-made over the next \"10-15 minutes.\" When I asked for a refund in order to make my quickly approaching departure I was told that it would take a while to get a manager to authorize the refund. Instead I was told I could grab $11.80 worth of pre packaged cookies and/or apples from near the register to make up the price of the pizza. A manager made it to the register rather quickly when I began to protest and I made my flight with refund in hand albeit quite hungry."}
{"text":"The mediocre reviews for HP kind of surprise me. I have been to this place a couple of times and really enjoyed it both times. On my first visit I had the small chopped salad and it was kind of average. Nothing too tasty. But the pizza was a whole other story. I was there with a large party so I got to sample several of the pizzas and there wasn't one that I didn't enjoy. By far my favorite pizza is the artichoke, carmelized onion and olive. It is fantastic! That is followed by the potato, garlic and fontina pizza. If you want a good old fashioned pepperoni or sausage pizza, then go somewhere else. But if you want something a little different and something that will get the taste buds going, try HP."}
{"text":"Cutest little pizza place for the location! We always get the signature sausage pizza and are never disappointed. The patio out front is a little tight but cozy. Great place to go after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"Things have changed here, went back several times for my beloved Caprese salad and was disappointed each time. The bread wasn't crusty, the tomatoes weren't warm and the ingredients were just slopped on the plate. The first time was it artfully prepared with attention to detail, since then it's been thrown together like an afterthought. I have given up hoping that the first plate was the standard rather than the exception. Too bad"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review and should have gotten to it a bit sooner, but here goes. We headed here for a date night on a busy weekend and made reservations since it was a Friday night and places seem to fill up pretty quickly after 6 p.m.  We arrived on time and there seemed to be plenty of seats, so we second guessed the need for a reservation - however, within about 20 minutes of being there, the place was packed, so we really had just beaten the rush.

We had a mix of foods, including a small turkey chili to start, some pasta (spaghetti for the Mrs and lasagna for me).  Everything was tasty and the little heart shaped breads and sour cream on the chili were a very nice touch to the experience.  Our server was very friendly and checked back regularly to make sure everything was going okay.

To finish the meal we had the pizza cookie dessert with ice cream.  I would have to sadly say that this was our least favorite thing since the cookie actually tasted a bit salty and this wasn't what we expected.

All-in-all we would definitely return here and give another dessert a go next time!"}
{"text":"Slow service. The point of coming for the express lunch is to be in and out. Took almost 5 minutes for someone to great me to get a table."}
{"text":"Spend your money next store at the Mexican spot. I had the FIG & PROSCIUTTO pizza... ummm I've never had prosciutto like that, I'd call it bacon. The onions were not caramelized they were cooked and tasteless. The fig jam was low quality. I had to add so much salt to the pizza to give it any flavor. To top it off it is small. It is no larger than a standard plate with about a inch or so of crust.  $18 for this pizza. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is my waitress (Rebecca per the receipt) kept my Pepsi filled and was super pleasant!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  When it's not exceedingly hot, I really enjoy sitting on the patio but the inside area has a nice, cozy vibe.  It's not a huge restaurant, but it has a nice neighborhood vibe.  If you have a group of more than 4 and want to sit inside, you may need to plan ahead and call for a reservation (if possible) if you're going during the weekend.  My favorite time to go is happy hour, but they have daily lunch and evening specials so there are many opportunities to save a buck and try new things.  My favorite things on the menu are the white sangria, veggie salad, and roasted mushroom pizza (minus the pancetta for me because I don't eat meat).  The service is always really friendly and parking is really easy.  The tables are a little close together and it can get a little crowded (especially when the weather is lovely).  We always try to get there a little early to avoid wait times."}
{"text":"I'm saving the last star for when I actually sit and eat in the restaurant. I always get my pizza to go...the Coppa Ham & Olive is the best.  I've only had that and split a salad with someone...but I've eaten it 15+ times (why mess with perfection?!)  I crave it at least once a week.  It's a bit pricey, especially since you can't actually get two small meals out of it.  It's either one giant meal (which I can't do) or one regular meal and a snack.  The ingredients are rather pricey as well, so I don't mind the extra cost. The crust is hand tossed and sometimes comes with slightly charred bubbles in the dough.  The ingredients are incredibly fresh.  The service is really amazing (even for carry-out).  They just celebrated their one-year anniversary and I'm looking forward to many more meals there. (I peeked at their wine selection and its pretty great.)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like the pizza here and the wait staff is friendly.  My boyfriend and I dine here regularly, usually stop in for a pizza and a glass of wine before the movie.  I'm partial to the Margherita pizza (in my opinion pizza is better when it is not overcrowded with toppings).  

The atmosphere is about what you expect from a strip mall pizzeria...lacks the cham or L'Grand Orange or Cibo.  I would have give the restaurant four stars except for the terrible top-forty soundtrack...a mellower sound track gets one more track.  How about some Sinatra, jazz..."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant.  Great food. Had a wonderful time and Matt was a great server.  We had the pretzel appetizer along with mozzarella sticks and a trial of all bruschetta.  The kids had chicken fingers. We also ordered two pizzas.  There was nothing left on the table to eat. And you could not beat the happy hour prices.

We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"It's an airport. Food is great considering what is around here. Go for it. It is good for airport food and trust me I have ate at a lot of airports."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza was not very good. I think their more about quantity than quality, looks like an assembly line. The dough was not crunchy but stale and hard."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing pizza!

I give this place five stars for the pizza, itself. The Chicken Pesto Pizza was loaded with moist chunks of chicken breast smothered in a generous portion of pesto (pictured.) The crust was thin, yet, chewy, not crusty or dry. Yum!

The two flavors of Bruschetta (pictured) were fine, but nothing to write home about. It's not to be compared to that of a few other CenPho dining spots.

The salad (pictured) had a lovely presentation, but I didn't care for it. I'm not sure if it was the greens or the dressing, but it tasted a bit bitter to me.

Unlike some other reviews I read here, i had no issue with the service.

If it weren't for the salad and bruschetta, I'd have given Humble Pie five stars!"}
{"text":"The caprese sandwich was divine and the sauce that came with the happy hour calamari was AMAZING. Hubs thought the red pizza saice was a bit lacking, but I was thrilled!"}
{"text":"HP is a great little neighborhood place! Everything on their menu is delicious. Cool bar area with outdoor stools and seating. Great staff and customers. It's a nice place to take a date, enjoy a cocktail by yourself or meet up with some friends."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at the Tatam location is good but overall, we were disappointed.
The happy hour prices are good.
The pizzas were OK.  We had the Fennel Seed/Sausage, the Roasted Mushroom and the Goat Cheese pizzas.  The crust is very good, but overall, all three were rather bland in taste. 
The biggest disappointment is the price/serving size of the Calamari and the Ceasar Salad. For the $9.00+ price, the size of the Calamari was about 1/3 of what you'd expect.  For about $12.00, the Ceasar salad was way too small (and we got the large size).  Anywhere else, these two items would have been much larger. 
Also, the Ceasar salad was very, very bland.  Not much taste.
I've been to Humble Pie approximately, 8 times over the years, but I've become increasingly disappointed. 
I most probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Slow to be acknowledged for a table. Gluten free pizza crust has a gross chemical flavor. Sauce salty, veggies not fresh. Server was nice, about he only good part of the visit. I would pass on this one. Unfortunately not much in the OdySea area to choose from."}
{"text":"I had been a huge fan of Humble Pie and sort of forgotten about it for a few months and was excited to go back again. However, I found the selection more limited than I remembered. Service is still excellent!  Pizza is still very tasty. Definitely a good staple for dining.  Quick with take out too and the food travels well."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Great pizza!  Really unique choices and so many of them. This is a definite new favorite and I will be back agsin as soon as I can because it was such a delicious meal and there are so many other things I want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"I eat here often, sourdough burger is great, so is express lunch. Can't go wrong with the SOP or meat lovers pizza. Chopped is my favorite salad!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to catch a great pizza. Happy hour specials from 11-6 make it well worth the trip/ not to mention kids eat free on Sunday's which in and of itself is a steal. 

Patio seating was awesome- lunch was laid back and relaxed, no rush to get in and out. 

We definitely plan to make this a regular stop for lazy Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"I'm taking a bite out of the SOP pizza and I'm thinking to myself, \"If the wise guy at Pizzeria Bianco is any better then this it only wins in a photo finish.\".  The pizza is really good...seriously.  The crust is light and smoky, the ingredients fresh and flavorful- local favorite Schreiners Sausage-, and the service attentive. 

The place has a great casual atmosphere.  So many places in this corridor of Scottsdale have a stuffy faux pretentiousness that really precludes any great enjoyment.  No need to dress up in your happy hour best here, just enjoy the game and the pie.

Also, Humble Pie is the only place, this side of Dabafetos in Rome, that can successfully pull off the egg on the pizza.  Try the Egg and Ham and you'll be a fan."}
{"text":"The food and service was great!!! I would recommend the grilled chicken sandwich or the meatball sandwich!"}
{"text":"May be the most unpleasant meal I have had in Scottsdale in a long time. Aside from the 90¬∞ temperature of the restaurant, the food was at best mediocre, the service was at best mediocre, and it is without a doubt the most expensive pizza joint in Phoenix for what you get $10 for a glass of of wine that came out of a box is ridiculous. Avoid this place like the plague and go to the parlor, the lamp or pizzeria Bianco or Pizza Hut for a much better value for your money."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this wonderful pizza place tucked away in the Hilton Village. I try to stop for a pie after a massage but I would drive half way across the world for just a taste of this delicious delicacy. 

My first visit was prompted by a post on Facebook. My friend frequently posted that she was there with her family. I thought, \"Oh, another kid's pizza joint with rubbery crust and crumbled cheese.\" I was happily mistaken. The pizza was delicious and the atmosphere was tasteful and worthy or a date-night. It is somewhat small inside but they have plenty of outdoor seating accompanied by any and all weather accessories (roll down shade, heaters, fans, etc.).

The first pizza I tried at Humble Pie was the Potato & Roasted Garlic with fontina, gorgonzola, rosemary. I was surprised that this wood fired potato pizza wasn't soggy or droopy. It was amazing. My next trip I had The Egg Pizza, which sounds scary but isn't. It was like breakfast on a pizza! You can't beat that!

The service can be slow at times but I have patience and I don't notice as much when I'm stuffing my face with their perfectly crunchy but chewy pizza crust. 

Minus one star for empty cups and late checks but 4 stars for wonderful food. I would recommend to everyone (and I have)!"}
{"text":"My family and I just tried to go and have dinner there. There was eight of us and they turned us away. I quote \"no we cannot sit you at the empty high top\" \"we don't ever sit people there\" \"my manager said no\" \"you can sit outside or not.\" My family is from out of town and I was completely embarrassed by the service of the manager and hostess. I will never go here and I will make sure to tel anyone I know because they embarrassed me. My family and I stood outside for 7 min in the cold trying to decide where to go now....... How disappointing."}
{"text":"After spending a half hour last Friday night trying to figure out where to go for dinner, we finally decided on Humble Pie. The kids had been here but I had not.  After a very nice meal, and sampling of a few different items, I thought it was a good place overall and I will go back:

I had the meatball sandwich.  The meatballs were huge and the bread was fresh and it was loaded with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.  The sauce was a bit bland, 

My son had the shrimp pizza which was amazing,  It was one of the best flavor combinations I have ever had and I want it next time I'm there.  I also tried the BBQ chicken pizza and the goat cheese and prosciutto pizza which were also pretty good.  We also had a fig bruschetta and a regular bruschetta which were outstanding.
 
Prices are average;  for 6 of us the entire tab was $116 and the server was phenomenal.  He was literally running his behind off, the place was packed but he was spot on, professional and pleasant.

The only thing I didn't care for:  it was very dark inside, I had to use the light from my phone to see the menu, and the music was turned up to a volume loud enough so that I could not hear the server.  As I mentioned above, I will go back."}
{"text":"We went for a little lunch after cleaning house to reward ourselves for our labor! I haven't been to this location and haven't been to Humble Pie in several years! We went in because I had fond memories of their Caprese Appetizer! I was happy to see it was still on the menu! Our server was very gracious and offered me samples of the 3 wines I was considering with my meal! My fianc√© enjoyed the strawberry & Gorgonzola salad with a individual chicken pesto pizza! It was all very delicious and the patio was shady & quiet which made the meal even more enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"Great location for a pizza place and the food was tasty. We came after an event in the quad for Halloween and it seems they may not have known about the event because they were understaffed. They had two servers running around in a full restaurant doing everything. And when I say everything I mean they were making their drinks on top of everything else. Poor planning on managements part and I feel terribly for the staff on tonight as they didn't stand a chance. Hopefully management has learned from this mistake and will be more prepared next time."}
{"text":"Ordered meat lovers omelette.  As most people in airports, had a flight to catch in about 45 minute.  Drastically burnt our omelettes AND bread.  Continuously empty waters and no compensations for ruined food.  Hire new cooks and servers immediately!"}
{"text":"After reading some good reviews, my hubby and I were anxious to try this place boasting wood fired, artisan type pizza.  Coming from San Francisco which boasts some great places (current fave is Beretta on Valencia - OMG) we were really missing some great, flavorful pie.  

I was surprised that we walked in and were seated easily on a Thursday evening around 7.  We had our twin toddlers with us and were hoping the place would be somewhat kid friendly (not particularly).  Unfortunately, our waiter was just odd and throughout the meal kept patting my shoulder...wha???  When I asked if we could have burrata on our margherita instead of the house mozzarella, his response was \"Burrata IS mozzarella.\"  Uh, duh???  He finally relented but said they would have to charge us \"a buck or something\".  When the pizza arrived, the presence of any cheese whatsoever was barely noticeable.  The sauce was under seasoned and watery.  The shrimp pizza with lemon zest was better, I would eat that again definitely , but in my mind if you cannot make a margherita pizza, well... that's telling."}
{"text":"Went there last night with the OGF for the first time to try it out.  Since they were celebrating their anniversary and pizzas were half price, seemed a good time to go.  It was quite crowded but managed to grab a couple seats at the bar.  Caught the end of happy hour and enjoyed $2 Bud Light drafts and excellent french fries for $3 as one of the happy hour appetizer specials.  The bartender warned us that the fries were good sized orders and maybe we wanted to split  an order, but we were starved and each got an order, and its a good thing we did, as the pizzas were on the small side.  We got an S.O.P. (sausage, carmelized onions, and roasted red peppers) and a Mushroom with sausage.  But despite my ordering my S.O.P well done, it came out with a rather soggy on the inside crust. The toppings were fresh and tasty, but my preference is for a crisp thin crust.
I would say compared to the Fallen Angel pizza at La Grand Orange
( which is similar to the S.O.P)  I would have to give the edge to LGO because of their crispier crust.  However, I like the ambiance at Humble Pie over LGO......its more like being in a real restaurant/bar.  LGO has more of a feel of some sort of communal barracks type atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came to Humble Pie after seeing it featured in Phoenix magazine (so sad that I can never find a place on my own...) and we were blown away.  It was a weeknight and all I wanted was some pizza to go and veg out on a couch watching a movie.  Well, after waiting on our to-go order we both wished we just stayed there! The restaurant is so incredibly inviting with its modern yet warm decor and a brick oven smack in the middle of the restaurant.  It was warm and smelled nice which was a bonus after walking from a car in 30 degree weather (crazy winter this year, isn't it?).  The staff were incredibly nice and we snacked on the \"butter\" mints that were placed by the exit while waiting.  I know they are for after the meal, but we were hungry!

Anyways, the pizza was fantastic.  One word: \"sourdough\"!  Well, it's either sourdough dough or something that tastes like it, but I thought that the pizza was fantastic!  It is not too thin and definitely not thick. Just perfect, on my taste buds.  We had parmesan chicken pizza (I think) and a margherita pizza.  Both were phenomenal.  We also ordered some french fries that were likewise super yummy.  As an aside, I was raised in NYC, which is famous for its pizza.  I have to say that Humble Pie's pizza is at least as good as New York pizza.  

I will definitely come back, and I cannot wait to try a date night (Thursday after 6 pm: an appetizer, pizza, and two salads for $20).  Also, apparently there are like 10 different food places in that general area on 7th Street -- time to check them out!"}
{"text":"Humble Pie deserves to be anything but humble for their food and great atmosphere. My party of amigos and I sat down at an outside table and we ordered our drinks promptly. Our friendly server, Josie, was quick with our drinks and frequently checked up on us throughout our meal. I ordered the gluten free margherita pizza being the gluten free consumer I am. We decided to sit outside and the weather was perfect. The outdoor dining area has screens that roll done to protect from the sun and they were a lifesaver. We were delivered our pizzas on time, not too quick and not too late. My pizza was easily one of the best gluten free crusts I've ever tasted. The mozzarella cheese tasted super fresh and cheesy, the fresh basil was delicious and delightfully added to the overall flavor of the pizza. The pizza was a perfect size (12 inches to be exact) for me as I happily consumed all of it. Humble Pie is a fantastic pizza restaurant with great atmosphere and better cuisine!"}
{"text":"Overpriced expected it's an airport, but 1 cup of cheese on a piece of dough thickness of notebook paper... no thank you . Think I'm kidding check out my pictures."}
{"text":"My official vote would be 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because of the great service, friendly staff and enjoyable ambiance.  

My friends and I grabbed Sunday lunch here.  I love Coronado Sunday brunch and lunch places.  Plus, you can head across the parking lot to the Main Ingredient Alehouse for a beer after and you'll be set for a great day! 

  I was craving a white pizza and my server recommended the Pear and Prosciutto.  However, I saw a pizza called \"Goat Cheese\" and I just had to have it.   I LOVE me some good goat cheese and pizza!  

I salivated watching all the pies being served to the patrons around me and excitedly dug in when mine arrived.  It was good, but not mind blowing.  Goat cheese has all the potential to be mind blowing, so I was a little disappointed.  I would probably order it again, but lower my expectations a little bit.   It does have good flavor, just wasn't quite what I wanted it to be.   

Be warned though, on my last performance review at work, I was told that I have unrealistically high expectations of others and myself, so I suppose that could apply to pizza too!  =)  

My friend had the BBQ chicken pizza.  Now that is not a pizza I usually enjoy, but after we swapped a slice, I felt like it was pretty good!  It had a nice tangy flavor, a little heat/kick, and was pretty tasty.   My other friend had the sourdough cheeseburger and the fries.  I snuck a few fries - they were awesome!  

Next time:  Pear and Prosciutto pizza. Let's see if the waiter did know best!  I'll get back to you and let you know how it goes!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place.  Stood for at least five minutes at the front without even being acknowledged while the phone just rang and rang.  

Guy walks up, says in a very unfriendly tone that he will be with me \"as soon as he can.\"  He then walks away with the phone in his hand.

Comes back a few minutes later and now says I can sit anywhere and he will get me a menu \"as soon as he can.\"

To be fair, they only had two people in in the middle of lunch rush hour which is ridiculous!  

I walked out because I had already been waiting for some time and there was no telling when I would get a menu or be able to place my order.

Advice to management, you need more than just two servers.  It's not fair to do that to your staff or your customers!

As a result I went elsewhere.  Lots and lots of choices of where to spend my money."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the family tonight. Seated immediately, but the table in the middle closest to the bar is so wobbly. Not the base either. The top. Time to get this fixed guys. 

We had a coupon for a free pizza or salad with a $20 purchase so can't really complain about the price. 

The fig prosciutto pizza was soggy and limp. Had to eat it with a fork. Kids got celery and carrots with their meal, but no ranch and never saw a server until we asked for the check so they did without. 

I was never sure who our server was. We saw three different people. It still took forever for someone to come back to our table after dropping off our food. We didn't get refills or anyone ask how the food was. 

Mediocre experience. Nothing great, but not the worst."}
{"text":"The place was 2/3 empty and yet the hostess tried to seat us next to the front door. I wish I could say the pizza was worth the lackluster service, but alas no. As a New Yorker I found myself fighting a strong urge to throw it across the room."}
{"text":"While we've had numerous opportunities to try other Humble Pie locations, we've always opted for something else. There are much better pizzas in the valley (even on the west side). The pizza was cold and bland. The service was lousy.  We were incredibly disappointed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"I don't get why anyone would call this pizza delicious.  The only thing good about the pepperoni pizza was the pepperoni.  The crust had all the flavor of a paper plate. They put a pinch of cheese on the pie and call it a pizza.  The best description of this pizza, in my opinion, is bland.  Maybe it's because I'm spoiled after having pizza as delicious as Joe's NY Pizza in Old Town, but this pizza is a big yawn.  The venue is great.  They just need a new recipie for pizza."}
{"text":"This place is on our regular rotation and it's consistently tasty. 

We get their pizza. Their pies are all one size -10 inches, thin crust but with a heartier surrounding edge; light, flavorful sauce, and varying cheeses/toppings. The margherita pizza has light, fresh mozzarella, while the veggie has heavier toppings and heavier cheese.

We usually get take-out. There's a separate counter for pick ups, with a little pizza warmer so your food doesn't get cold while it wait for you. It's always quick."}
{"text":"I ordered a 9 inch pepperoni pizza and a chopped salad to go. If I had a spare moment and if I was 21 it would've been great to sit down at the bar and order a drink or two. When I got home to grub I had to warm up my pizza in the microwave a bit. Had I eaten at the restaurant it would've been more amazing than what it already was. The salad was great as well. Not too much meat and the amount of dressing provided was perfect. I would definitely take a friend to eat at the actual establishment and enjoy a nice afternoon with great people."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about Humble Pie. Right in the middle of a typical Snottsdale strip mall full of stuffy boutiques and snooty bistros, Humble Pie is busy keeping it real. I will say that if you're one of those \"better than you\" snobs who can't find satisfaction with anything, HP is probably not for you but for everyone else, it's worth a trip.

 In short, Humble Pie is all about friendly service and outstanding food, made fresh by hand every day, served hot and served quickly for a price that is more than fair. The atmosphere is casual, yet classy. You can go with buddies to watch the game, or you can take a date and still impress. The wine list is one of the better ones around unless you're on an unlimited budget.  The salads are huge (my wife and I split a small salad, and each half is bigger than a normal house salad at other places!) and delicious,and  the pizza is outstanding. They offer the old standards or you can be adventurous and order a more exotic Humble Pie original. The kids' menu is about normal, but the food quality and quantity is outstanding. The \"chicken fingers\" were really four large chicken breast patties, pounded flat and lightly breaded. They were then covered with a large pile of tasty fries. I almost cancelled my pizza order and went with another order of the chicken! For dessert, I highly recommend the Chocolate Chip Ice Cream \"pizza\": A baked-to-order 6\" or 8\" cookie with two or three scoops of ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream.

This place just lives up to it's name. The owner is almost always in-house and will likely stop by your table at least once and make sure you're satisfied. The wait staff is always smiling, and always willing to help. We've never had a bad experience here. It is the antithesis of the typical stuck-up, nose-in-the-air Scottsdale prima-donna hang outs, which is probably why I like it so much. It's real people serving great food in a relaxed environment for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place I've ever visited. There is only one word that can be used to describe the bartenders at this restaurant. RUDE!!! 

There was one polite bartender who served my food while two other bartenders were listening in on the conversation that I was having with a friend. The two bartenders not serving me and my friend chimed in with their univited comments while my friend was joking at the bar. One male bartender (dark hair with crew cut) was so rude he told my friend to stop talking at the bar. Only bars that don't want to keep customers tell customers to stop talking at the bar.

I read another review describing a similar experience with the bartenders on Tripadvisor so this is regular occurrence. Complaints are being made.  But this bar is counting on customers to just deal with their rude behavior because most people at the airport are in a rush to grab something to eat and drink. 

Avoid this bar. Rude behavior should never be rewarded.

Another reason you want to avoid this place is the food gave me a headache for several hours after I ate the meal. I would give this place a crappy food and crappy service rating."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my
Man having delicious pizza! We had a really funny server named Kyle who made our dinner fun :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced pizza. Staff is OK could be better. Pretty good pizza. Had the pepperoni pizza and would get again if I ever go back."}
{"text":"Now I know why this place has relatively low stars. I've been waiting for lunch for about 40 minutes with a waiter who obviously does not care. Please ask for someone else if you get \"Ginger\". Not only I did my wine arrive in a dirty glass, wait for the picture, but the coveted signature meatballs were cold upon arrival. Maybe they were warm when they first arrived on the line but even the \"sauce\" looked like it had set. 

To make matters worse, 3 parties sat around me, all received food before I did. They may have a chance when I return to Phoenix, but for right now, thumbs down all the way!!"}
{"text":"I probably come to Humble Pie at least once a week. The staff is all amazing and always treat us like friends. During lunch they have a great specials. You can get a small pizza with a salad or cup of soup, or a soup and salad combo. Everything has always come out super quickly. They also have great drink specials all day and happy hour appetizers after 3 PM. My favorite pizza is the egg pizza, it is perfect for a hangover, especially when you pair it with a jalape√±o mary (made with jalape√±o infused vodka). They also have great fries, calamari, and the pretzel with Bree is fantastic. You seriously can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Yum.  I could end my review there, but my mystery \"fans\" might be disappointed.

We had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I'm glad about that because I didn't care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I'm not fond of sitting on a stranger's lap generally.  

We started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment \"you finished that already?\"  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, \"wow, nice job fat-ass.\"

Next up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn't.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it's still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can't wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!

Suffice it to say...Yum."}
{"text":"Pricy as expected for airport food. But I will say, the portions are pretty large compared to what you get at other places. 

I ordered the standard cheese pizza; tasted fine but there was a lot of crust of the edge (without toppings) and the pizza in general was very thick and doughy."}
{"text":"This place sucked. For one it was squished there was no room to even put your chair. They took 30 minutes to get us drinks. They took a half hour to get my daughter ice cream. They messed up on our pizza. Their sausage was bad or something because I came home and needed to throw up. I'm sick now and I'm so disgusted. This was horrible do not go there."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to a Humble Pie, and my 2nd time to this location. My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch after watching a movie, and it definitely hit the spot!

Daily lunch specials are from 11am to 3pm with 9\" pizzas and a salad or soup. What's nice about their specials is that you can choose any pizza and any salad or soup they have available.  FYI: Regular pizzas are 12\"

So far, I've tried about 8 of their pizzas, and my goal is to try every single one of them...
1. Meatlovers - all time favorite here! If you're a meat-a-tarian like me, must order this!
2. Prosciutto and Fig - It's unique but full of flavor
3. Shrimp - Great if you love shrimp! It's light on the \"seafoody\" flavor and has sprinkles of red chili peppers and lemon zest which tastes good because it's both spicy and sweet
4. Potato and Roasted Garlic - I enjoyed this, but would like it even more if they added truffle oil to it
5. Margherita - Definitely good, but not Pizzeria Al Forno-ish( which I love)
6. Pepperoni - Well, this is biased b/c I love pepperoni pizzas no matter what
7. Artichoke - Rich one here, especially with ricotta cheese. I'm not a fan of artichokes, but I actually enjoyed this one at an Elite Yelp event
8. Goat Cheese - Strong goat cheese flavor - go fig.... I like goat cheese on salads, but it was a bit strong for me since it was on entire pizza

My next goal is to try the pistachio one and maybe the S.O.P (Sausage onion and red peppers) and I will update my review once I try those. 

Our service here has been great every time! Compared to the other earlier reviews (and I don't blame that one review about being upset about getting orders wrong), I guess I've just lucked out every time I've been there, because my orders have been right and service has been quick. My waiters and waitresses have been very friendly and constantly check in to see how I'm doing. I guess my one complaint today was that my napkin was dirty before I even used it, but they changed it for me, so then I was happy again. I'm easy to please as long as I get my pizza!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere inside this place. Nice indoor brick oven. Relaxing outdoor seating that had ample shading on the wrap around patio!
I ordered the Rosemary potato pizza and added chicken to it while Bryan (my \"hubs\")  ordered the meat lover's pizza. Being a meat lover myself, I should've known that the meat lover's pizza was particularly more tasteful and \"better\" than mine, but mine was still good. I used to love the rosemary chicken potato pizza at California Pizza Kitchen until it was sadly discontinued. I was almost so upset that I refrained from going to CPK for awhile (I know... silly reason, but that's me!) I was looking to fulfull that need with the rosemary potato pizza here. I really do believe that it's good, but I felt the flavor could've been stronger. I barely could taste the rosemary in the pizza. 
Strangely enough...What I loved more than anything though was the pizza crust. It just tasted wonderful and had the right texture to it! This wonderful crust paired with the meat lover's pizza was sooo- good! So even though my own didn't wow me, because I loved the meat lovers and because I want to try all the other huge varieties of pizzas here, I will definitely return! It'd be cool if there could be a gigantic \"sampler\" pizza of all their specialty pizzas, but I guess that would be kind of hard to accomplish, now wouldn't it? One can dream..."}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other day and ordered an artichoke pizza, a pepperoni pizza and the green beans tempura. The waitress was very friendly and recommended the green bean tempura.  I could've eaten a couple orders of those by myself.  They were excellent and I highly suggest them.  They were only $4 during happy hour and my Hop Knot IPA was only $2.50 during happy hour.  That was a great deal.  The pizza was very good.  I give the artichoke pizza high remarks and the pepperoni pizza was also good.  We sat inside but they have an outside seating area as well.  If you're at Desert Ridge this is a solid choice for a pie and beer."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I didn't try the pizza, though it looked delicious, but since it's hard to mess up anything with burrata and I wanted something fresh- I went with the caprese. 

The pesto was great, the burrata was of course really good as well and I liked the sour ciabatta it was served with. My only gripe was that it was hard to eat. I prefer fresh tomatoes, sliced. I found it a little difficult to get the delicious fresh taste of the ingredients in every bite with the roasted cherry tomatoes. I also just like the fresh flavor or raw tomato with the richness of the burrata and olive oil, and I guess the balsamic could be toned down.

However,  with all my gripes (everyone's a critic, right?), it was still very tasty, and the wine was decent and reasonably priced. I will return."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Friday night. We tried the prosciutto/pear/gorgonzola/arugula pizza and the sausage/red pepper/ricotta pizza. Both were very good! I would caution against leftovers as the crust became rock hard when reheated in the oven..."}
{"text":"After reading a few bad reviews I hesitated to come here, but after considering the content of those reviews I decided to give it a try. Because of a monsoon my flight was delayed over an hour and I was in need of good food and good beer. The place was PACKED (likely due to all the delayed flights).  Anyway, I'm very glad I decided to give it a try. My margherita pizza was DELICIOUS and my Blue Moon definitely hit the spot! I boarded my plane an hour later feeling great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've never had a bad experience here. Food is delicious! I'm addicted to the vodka penne pasta dish with chicken! Super YUMM!!! I order my stuff to go & I never have to wait long. Staff has been friendly every time I pop in & the cookie pizza thing is another delicious item!!!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of wood fired pizza a la Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco, you'll love this.

The restaurant, which has more of a sports bar atmosphere than fine dining attitude, is one big room with a bar separating the main dining room from the patio that overlooks the parking lot. The oven is in everyone's view, as well as an open kitchen plus several sports televisions throughout the restaurant. It is a wonderful place to go if you're looking for a laid-back, low-key atmosphere that doesn't skimp on the quality of food.

For starters, my pal and I shared the freaking huge \"small\" veggie salad ($6.95), which was probably one of the best house salads I've ever had. It had jicama, avocado, corn, tomatoes, green and white beans and house made mozzarella, and I got it with ranch. The combination of all those yummy veggies was amazing.

Then for dinner, we each got our own pizzas, and I tried both. Based on the big portion of the salad, we should have split one pizza, because we both ended up taking half of our 12-inch pies home. I got a cheese pizza ($9.95) with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, and I added goat cheese and olives to it ($2 each). The goat cheese was so flavorful, and the consistency of the dough was soft and chewy, like I like it. I thought my order was really great.

My pal got the artichoke pizza ($12.95), which came sauceless with fontina and ricotta cheese, caramelized onions and olives. We both wished there would have been sauce on the pizza, but his also tasted great with the variety of cheeses.

I think the restaurant is a great deal for the portions it gives you, and I'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain. 

They brag about their brick oven pizzas, but we thoroughly enjoyed a good caesar salad too.  Enough for 2.  And a generous plate of their excellent lasagna, cheesy,  the filling was creamy, baked in a good flavored marinara. The sausage in the lasagna had a nice fennel seed flavor, something I enjoy.

For our pizza, we went nontraditional this time and tried a pie that was topped with arugula, prosciutto, gorgonzola, and roasted pear. Decent tasting, even liked the crust, but the gorgonzola was a bit more \"ripe\" than I had hoped. Just my personal preference. 

Mr. B also took advantage of the Happy Hour, a glass of red  wine for $5.

And then it was time to whip out my groupon.  My groupon which cost me $11 took care of the first $20. While I paid yet another $22 for all those dishes, there was still plenty to bring home for another meal. I feel happy when a meal costs us in the $30 range these days, and happier when there are leftovers that I know I will eat and enjoy in the near future.

They have attractive specials for each day of the week.  Today was Sunday, and that meant there were lots of kids eating for free. Good deal for the family and a far better pizza than that cardboard stuff they call pizza at most chains.

Fast, good service. Pleasant dining area. And I would do it again."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Chicago, I know a good pizza when I taste one, and this was a pretty good pizza.  You see the chefs pulling them out of the brick oven from your seat.

We really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere with a great drink selection and a tremendous service."}
{"text":"(3.625) ~ Good Overall Food & Service.  Just wish they had the FULL menu of the downtown restaurant...

MY MENU:
* Chocolate Chip Cookie = (3.75) ~ Good & semi-soft.
* Margarita Pizza = (3.5) good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to have our weekly \"cheat meal\" at Humble Pie last Saturday night 3/15 after I had received a flyer for one free pizza at work. I had eaten at another location once before so I was looking forward to our dinner. We arrived Saturday night, hungry as can be, around 8 pm. There were many tables available both inside and out and we patiently waited for the hostess to arrive to seat us. It took her a minute to get to the front but that is understandable when there is only one hostess working; she greeted us and we asked to sit at an outside table. The patio was a good size and there were probably 3 other tables sat outside when we arrived. We excitedly looked over the menu, chatted about our day, picked out 2 appetizers and 2 pizzas and waited. the waitress that was taking care of the outside tables had been out about 3 times bringing food, checking on her existing tables, busing empty tables, but not once even glancing in our direction. She had more that enough chances to even extend an \"I will be right with you guys!\" but nothing. I had spent years myself in the service industry so customer service is HUGE with me, and I understand what its like to be \"in the weeds\" busy, but still, you have to acknowledge your table ASAP! I'm not fussy because I get it, but it got to the point where I actually said, did they forget about us? At this point, I decided whatever I'll just go out let someone know we need help. I politely approached the bar where the hostess was at this time, and said, excuse me...? No one has been over to help us yet. She stands there expressionless and says \"ok.\" No urgency whatsoever. Luckily the bartender overheard and said he would be right out to help us. So back at the table the bartender apologizes that our waitress is very busy and he will get us started for her. In my head I'm rolling my eyes because she had plenty of chances to greet us, but what can you do, I'm not going to let it ruin our dinner. We go ahead and place our whole order with the bartender and he quickly has our drinks out and our order placed. The two appetizers came out right away, and were delicious! We had the cheesy bread and a pretzel.After they arrived we realized we didn't have silverware. So I again got up, went to the bar, and asked for silverware. Feel like I should get paid I've been working so much at this dinner! We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza; both were awesome! So we finished up and we pretty satisfied with the quality of the food, our server came out to wrap things up and offered dessert on him to make up for our wait if we saved room; which we gladly accepted. We had the pizza cookie desert and it was so good! I would go back just for that! So after all was said and done, the food was good, the bartender saved the day with that desert, and we will probably visit Humble Pie again."}
{"text":"Odd name for a pizza with several out of the ordinary choices.  For a starter, grilled corn along with a half price Monday Italian Pinot Grigio wine.  The two color corn was better than usual but thought the wines on the list were 20% higher with a 50% discount.  The selected wood charred pizza was  shrimp, home made mozzarella, basil herb, chili flakes and lemon zest.  One of the better, lighter pizzas plus a tasty crust.  There  were additional meat choice toppings but would prefer other veggie/herb choices for more diverse flavors.

The indoor seating was comfortable but very close quarters.  Three different servers brought the food when it was ready which was a good thing.  The patio is relatively small with a bad sun angle so may try it next time after the sun has gone down."}
{"text":"When you come here get the fries as an app and the doughnuts for dessert! The pizzas are great, the SOP is my favorite. I've only had 1 that I didn't care for. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The first time was such a meh experience, that I am surprised we came back.  But came back we did.

The restaurant itself is nice.  But there was only one other couple there the first time.  The second time in was a tad better, but still was a very empty restaurant for a Sunday night.

So we have tried the fig and prosciutto, prosciutto and pear, meat lovers, and the shrimp pizza.  They were all okay.  The shrimp was my least favorite.

The servers were friendly and efficient.  They looked bored though, and I don't blame them.  There was a whole aura of boredom throughout the restaurant.  But that could be because of how empty it was.

Sadly, I don't think I will be back.  I really did try to like this place."}
{"text":"Okay.. so I'm one of those people who loves taking a chance and trying grand openings. Humble Pie is one of this places Ive been waiting for since I read about it a year and a half ago. So today was their first public opening so with a spray of cologne and some plastic we were on our way!

Let me tell you up front, this place is going to be packed for a while. We arrive around 6:30 pm and not a table to be had so we opted to sit at the bar. We had a pretty good vantage of the whole place.. from the warming boxes at the front to the wine cellar on the far part of the restaurant (I want one of those!). The space looks like it's not quite finished but you can tell and feel that the space is going to be very comfortable. 

To start they offer wine flights, oh yeah honey.. thats what I'm talking about! Nothing like a nice heady wine buzz to get things started. Pouring over the menu was pretty easy.. there are a handful of apps, salads and pizza's. I started with the Grilled Steak Salad.. this salad is very good though the addition of some cheese would sent it over the top! We also ordered the Humble Caprese.. you know when your toes start to curl when you're about to uh, uhm.. well, ya know.. its sort of like that! Super creamy mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine.. it doesn't get much better, simple, clean and flavorful.

Pizza's.. Schreiners Sicilian Sausage with roasted Fennel.. Wild Mushrooms and Pancetta.. to start the crust.. light, slightly crisp, chewy, slightly salty in a good way.. for me, the crust here was nothing short of perfect.. it held the ample toppings nicely and of a nice chew and balance with the flavors of the topping. Sausage and Fennel was great plus nothing like sourcing locally! The Mushroom and Pancetta was a nice balance of earthy mushroom varieties and crispy salty pancetta. The mozzerella on the pizza's was the same heavenly pillow used on the Caprese.. beware, addictive!

We also received a mistake pizza of Pepperoni Pizza.. apparently we were in the right place at the right time since the guy next to us liked his mistake pizza (no sauce) so we were happy to take it off the waiters hands!  I'm not a fan of pepperoni, usually it's greasy limp and fatty. The pepperoni was crisp and well, I could eat one of these for breakfast!  I'm glad that kitchen had a few kinks to work out, this was a great mistake.

On to the desserts.. we tried the Olive Oil Gelato as well as the Fresh Berry Crostada. Having had Olive Oil Gelato at a place in LA called Mozza I was hoping that Humble's version would be better. It didn't disappoint! A very light taste of good olive oil surrounded in a creamy well textured gelato.. I would order this one over and over again! The Crustada was well done and since berries are in season this made for a nice treat.

So me and the Mister very much liked this place and want to fall in love.. so right now we are in the infatuation period.. we went ahead and made a reservation for tomorrow night.. I have plans on chowing down a Shrimp, Barrata pizza and or course, that marvelous pepperoni."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and each time my boyfriend and I eat or drink here its been great. The service has been quick the food is fabulous. I enjoy coming here and glad its not far from my house."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza and atmosphere here! The food is always great and staff is very welcoming. We have been coming here for years and it has turned into our very own version of \"Cheers\"."}
{"text":"Decent selection on the menu with lots of unique flavors. Went for lunch and when we first walked in the smell of oil was almost overwhelming. Fast and polite service. The happy hour prices looked decent."}
{"text":"The pizza are singe size, but could be split and shared by two. They are on the upper end of personal pizzas. I really liked the openness of the restaurant, and the bar area. 
I would go back just for the bar area, and the waiting space that they have. I am not taking anything away from the food, because the salads and pizzas we had were very good. I just like to drink too, and they had a cool set up. 

This place is worth stopping in at if you are hungry or just looking to hang out an get a drink."}
{"text":"On first glance, this is a charming little pizzeria with an inviting atmosphere. They have a nice indoor-outdoor bar with lots of extra seating. 

I visited at around 9pm and they were still busy with customers. They serve Four Peaks brews on tap which is a nice change. 

I ordered their house sausage sandwich with a side of greens with a vinaigrette. The food took about 20 minutes, was a good portion, and very tasty. I'm glad there is a new bar/restaurant on Happy Valley Road, and will very likely be visiting again."}
{"text":"so i've heard this place is \"as good\" as bianco's....i wouldn't know because on principle alone, i absolutely, definitively REFUSE to stoke the ego and elitism of anyone req'ing me to wait 2 hours to eat their food. 

the place is cute and has plenty of room to avoid a 2 hour wait....and the pizza was good. wood oven baked so it had that little burnt crispy edge. we had the mahhhhgahhhhrita pizza and it was enough to stave our pizza crave. and then we indulged in their version of the desert pizza cookie. although quite bigger than oregano's, it wasn't as sweet, but altogether still tasty! 

for our pizza, half the desert, a glass of wine....20 bucks for 2 people!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place that I probably eat at once a week due to its location and quick take out. I like this place because its different then a \"normal\" pizza place since this is not \"normal\" pizza. The crust is thin (the \"outer\" crust is soft and could be much less bready) and sourdough-ish tasting, I like it. It goes well with the Pizza's I usually order which is the Shrimp, lemon and red pepper or the Goat cheese, tomato and sweet red pepper. I might have strange tastes, but I really like these pizza's. They are basically a \"personal\" size pizza. If I'm famished, I eat the whole thing. 
For the meat eaters, I hear the prosciutto one is pretty good. 
I haven't really tried much else on the menu beside a salad, since much of the other menu has meat containing items. The veggie salad was ok but could use more flavor. 
Any how I'll be back next week....."}
{"text":"We should have read the reviews before we wasted our time and money here.  The kitchen is very disorganized and our servers was RUDE.  After waiting at least 30mins for 2 cold pizzas our server argued with us and said they were hot.  They were stone cold.  They begrudgingly remade our pizzas in 12 mins but we had to ask for them to go because we had been there so long.  Bad attitude and 3 times the price of their restaurant in Scottsdale.  Granted they are at the airport but at least they can have their act together.  I think it's time for a different restaurant in that space!!"}
{"text":"I have here twice now and enjoyed both experiences. Last night it took a while to be seated but we enjoyed the Thursday date night meal option. I loved that you could choose your own salad. Our waiter was memorable for inappropriate homosexual references which was a downer (I am glad my friends really were not gay then for their sake). Our other friends pizza was burned twice so we were finished eating by the time he had his. Luckily we were all able to share. The restaurant comped his desert which was nice and we all enjoyed the fried donut holes. Descent food, nice atmosphere, a little crowded but not too noisy. Fine by me."}
{"text":"I love pizza and scottsdale has some of the finest pizza around. 

But run far, far away from this place. 16$ for a pep thats small, burnt, and just horrible. I eat at sauce pizza and wine almost 4 times a week. Whole foods has wonderfull pizza and was 5$ cheaper and a 18\" . They blow this place out of the water. 

I will never be coming back to humble crappy pie ever. 

Try costco or something.  Seriously way better then this crap."}
{"text":"Their pizza has a very unique flavor. It is wood fired or something so the crust is very crispy and black. Not a very saucy pizza. Their wine that is exclusive to them is amazing! Definitely get it if you go."}
{"text":"This location has a head chef that is \"the soup Nazi\". You can get items to go except desert. The chef feels that the presentation of their deserts are not good enough therefore \"no desert to go!\"
Many of us used to frequent this place several times a week, including the summer when they desperately needed the business. Not anymore!
Servers were always pleasant but not allowed to allow certain foods out the door.
CRAZY!!!!!
The Good news is it helped our groups discover Zipps next door and we now all meet there for dinners. There is a reason this establishment is always empty and a staple on price reductions on Groupon. 
Save yourself the trouble as there are just too many good resteraunts in the valley."}
{"text":"For an airport pizza spot, this is a diamond in the rough. When you're in undated with Pizza Hut express and Sbarro at every turn in the flyer jungles of major metropolitan hubs, finding a place like Humble Pie provides a breath of fresh air. 

Until you see the price. 

Margherita pizzas start at $13+ and the specialty pizzas are about $16.50+. Don't worry, once you get past the sticker shock, it's actually a solid pie and the box fits conveniently under the seat in front of you."}
{"text":"This was our third stop of the night after deciding no on two prior lengthy waits.  Our party of 7 was seated immediately and greeted by friendly staff. Our waiter was spot on,  answered all our questions, and ensured we never had an empty glass

We started with appetizers and a few cold beers ( mozzarella sticks and wedge salads) which were spot on.

I decided to go with the spaghetti and meatballs.  This was the down turn of the meal. The spaghetti was average, possible a little undercooked, but had a good sauce.   The meatballs were the low point two of three were good but the third was as hard as a rock, and unable to be ate. This  put a damper on the meal, but not the mood. 

All in all this place has a lot of potential and I will go with a pizza next time as they looked amazing when the waiter was brining them out to other guests. 

I will be giving this one three out of five stars.  As the atmosphere and service were spot on. I Will try this place again and give the pizza a try next time I'm in Phoenix before rendering my final opinion."}
{"text":"30 minutes for a drink. Our waitress forgot to put in our drink order and when she came back 20 minutes later to tell us our drinks would be right out and take a food order I informed her we were unsure if we would have time to eat she took our menu in a huff. we then waited another 10 minutes for drinks and were clearly inconveniencing her by asking to pay immediatly. thank you carol. the service was outstanding. I thought 45 minutes would be enough time to eat at the airport. I guess not when it takes 30 minutes to pour a beer."}
{"text":"So we are visiting from San Antonio, TX came here for a quick bite to eat. The 1st night it was great.... Great food good service. Today lets just say... Left much to be desired. The food was great the service could if used a tune up. The waiter gave us attitude because we asked for individual checks. Told us he had other tables and was busy. I'm sorry my money is good you should earn your tip!"}
{"text":"Very Expensive for what you get ... even for an airport

The \"POG\" sounded great, and the flavor was pretty good, BUT I'm not sure if I got one that had been sitting or what...

crust was completely soggy, except the edges
ricotta cheese was only a shadow - like it had been over cooked and evaporated

I might try them again but I would not spend my own money doing it."}
{"text":"New restaurant with a few bugs to work out. Our server was new and not completely at ease with the menu, the pricing, the specials.  Food was good, but experience left something to be desired. Glad HP is in the hood, but fix it quickly."}
{"text":"So bummed about writing this. Got a pizza, Mac and cheese and a salad delivered from Uber eats. Pizza had no flavor, Mac and cheese was just GROSS. Basically noodles with milk and bacon. The chopped salad was delicious. Is that weird the salad was our favorite part! Biggest complaint was I emailed them that night and they didn't respond and it's been about ten days"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Freshly made while you wait for your flight! Highly recommend!! I had the pesto chicken with onions! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So happy to have them in the neighborhood! We have quickly become regulars! The food is excellent with a great selection.  Great lunch and happy hour specials and excellent homemade Sangria! I am a fan of the red, but the white is pretty darn good too! Great family place where we have taken the kids during the day or for an early dinner, more of an adult atmosphere.  The servers are all very friendly and accommodating! Have not yet had a pizza that we don't like and all the appetizers are wonderful too! Got to try it! You will become a fan."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and the pies are average.  The interior and patio are joined via an open concept and they seem to have great happy hour specials every day.  I tried the lunch special (a pie and soup).  Although it was decent, it wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"I need to update my review because I was so specific in the original and some things have changed. I still love Humble Pie but they changed the fries and I don't like them. The pizzas are still delicious -- these days I especially like the one with leeks and pistachios -- and the veggie salad still rules (although there have been times it has been overdressed). Humble pie is definitely in the pizza rotation! 

Also, still a great place to drink wine with half off bottles on Mondays or $5/glass until 6 p.m. everyday! Not to mention the prices are still beyond reasonable even when it's not happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale in the summer....wait, what?!! You did that...on purpose?! Well, if you're there when it's hot or civilized, enjoy a truly great Italian place called HUMBLE PIE!!! 
The pizza was as close to Brooklyn as you could get in the Southwest and the meatballs and sauce were dense and delicious. A note on the sauce: they really have the sweet and tangy down in their marinara. Humble Pie is a MUST if you are in the Phoenix area. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Not to impressed. We bought a couple pies. Chicken pesto. Weird and ended up tossing. Roasted mushroom seemed salty and no sauce on it. I guess that if pizza is what you want, play it safe and stay with cheese or pepperoni."}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes to be seated while there were open tables, their excuse was.. \"we haven't gotten around to bussing the table.\" Like do your job is it really that difficult for you to clean a table while you're working, I felt like getting up and wiping it down myself. I solely blame one rude employe named Hannah she's a short blonde with a horrible attitude, it's really disappointing we eat lunch at Humble Pie often, this was our first time at this location and never again. I see that they treat certain customers better than others. If you're a young person don't bother coming here you'll be disrespected and taken as a joke. I absolutely hated it here! Good luck if you try it, they're awful and honestly I was afraid to eat my food. They seem as the type to spit in it. Also, I am an open lesbian women and if looks could kill.. I felt judged and ignored from the moment I walked in. I am a very polite person therefore I find no other explanation other than the fact that my appearance was not to their liking."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get pizza for dinner! really laidback atmosphere! My 8year old daughter loves it too. This is our spot for our mommy daughter dates!"}
{"text":"Have been to Humble Pie several times, and have never been disappointed! The bruschetta is AMAZING, as well as the pizza. The happy hour is great, and we have always received spectacular service. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Thursday Date Night Special. 6-9pm. 1 appetizer 2 salads and a pizza of your choice all for just $24. Now one of my favorites when I'm near my wife's work."}
{"text":"Solid 4....   been there twice for lunch.

They serve the thin crust pizza which isn't my favorite, but the flavor is good; so a trade off.

Pro's
- lunch special good deal (large personal pie & salad)
- Gorgonzola salad fantastic!
- good service (saw some knocks in other reviews, didn't encounter)
- atmosphere good; it does seem a mix of bar/restaurant - that's okay.

Con's
- I prefer a little thicker crust


I'll come back.  It's a solid go-to place when hankering some za."}
{"text":"A great quick lunch spot. You can get a salad and a mini pizza for under $12. The pizza is good and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Everything sounded good in the menu. Took 8 minutes to finally decide, but I can say the sourdough cheeseburger was a solid choice. The pizza was perfect as well. Crispy crust, unburnt and not too greasy even with all the meat on it."}
{"text":"Little slow at lunch but they seemed understaffed. Sausage pizza was good and about what I expected from friend reviews. They seem to have good specials on thursdays for \"date nights\" but it's just average. Nothing special but if I was in the area and wanted pizza I'd go in again."}
{"text":"$17.00 for a shot of Patron on the rocks is dishonest at best. It's just ugly. ok airport rent or fees, etc. But ugly is ugly. It makes having a drink just no fun is the bottom line and that's not good."}
{"text":"I am only giving a 2 star because the service was nice. 

If you are reading other reviews and they are negative, BELIEVE them. 

I know this is an airport but if you are gonna have a name with \"humble\" in it and you charge $20 for a small pizza, then you need to rethink it. Im telling you, this pizza was BURNT! I always love to eat the crust but this time I did not. It was so burnt that I didnt even want to touch the pizza. The pizza itself was so poorly made. I had at least 6 pepperonis on top of each other and when I picked up a slice, all of the cheese and topping came off. I mean really? I would rather go to MOD pizza where they charge $8 for the same size pizza with fresh ingredients and made with CARE. 

I feel like these restaurants take advantage of people who are traveling by charging them an arm and a leg for mediocre food; how shameful."}
{"text":"I think Yelpers are right, this place deserves 4 stars. The food is always yummy, and it is a good place for happy hour!

The pizza is delicious, the crust is the best part. The crust kind of makes or breaks a pizza place for me, and it is excellent here. Pizza is my favorite food of all time, but I rarely order the pizza when I go here, because the Caprese Sandwich is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, a couple of years ago they changed the way they made it. Now it is a small sandwich. Still tastes awesome, but not something to order if you're really hungry. I also like that they offer cottage cheese as a side, because I am weird and sometimes prefer cottage cheese over fries. I have also ordered a red sangria here and really enjoyed it. The service here is fine, no problems here.

Would love to be able to motivate myself to try something else on the menu..but the Caprese sandwich..I just can't!"}
{"text":"We love Humble Pie and love to bring our family and friends with us on Sundays. We came today with 16 people. They told us the wait for our group would be 45 minutes. While we were deciding whether or not to stay, they seated our entire group-within 5 minutes! Our server, Patrick, did a fabulous job! More reasons to love Humble Pie!"}
{"text":"The place is much too loud for my taste.  Not that the music isn't good, it just gets in the way of good conversation.  If you live close by, get take out.  The pizza will still be good (the potato is by far the best) although the crust has gotten doughier than I like.  They are the perfect location though when you've had a few beers at the Main."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins for order of a salad and 2 spaghettis guess waiter delayed the order. What gives they were not busy.  Good food poor service."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the little restaurants in Sheridan square.  I can't say much for the interior, I'm not a fan of exposing the bare bones of a building and calling it \"d√©cor.\"  However, I still found it comfortable inside.  I ordered a Stella (on tap) and a margherita pizza.  The pizza was good.  I found the dough comparable to Red Devil, although, still not as good.  The sauce reminded me of this delicious spaghetti sauce that my mom learned how to make when she lived in Italy.  She uses grape tomatoes and that's what this sauce tasted like, I enjoyed it, I thought it added a nice flavor to the pizza.  By definition, a margherita pizza should have garlic, this one didn't have any.  The basil had been chopped up and again, the pizza typically calls for whole pieces.  All in all, I'd give the pie 3 stars.  I'm kicking in an extra star for the amazing service from Rizzo the bartender, he made my day."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Everything else could use some work. We never got our appetizer so I'm going to just assume it would have been as good as the spaghetti and the chicken sandwich! The service SUCKS! Didn't see our server at all, he wasn't in the same room as us the entire time we were eating. He finally showed up after we got our own box and sat there for 5 minutes. When we asked for the check he went behind the bar and waited on customers for 10 minutes till we finally got up to go pay.  The place was not busy. There were some people but plenty of staff. We had really high hopes for this place but good food isn't enough to get a five star review. The staff quite obviously did not care about the customers. We may go back but it's kind of far for us so it might be awhile. If the service had been better we would drive from mesa to cave creek to eat here anytime!"}
{"text":"A bad start and ending

Had to wait at the host stand for a few minutes, but it was no big deal as they were busy and someone after a minute or so said they'd be right with me. 

Sitting down I got a snarky comment from the bartender when I told her my dob after her 3rd time scanning my ID. 

Apparently \"bourbon and coke\" means a premium drink to this bar tender.  

One of the few positives is that the sourdough was okay. Nothing to write home about, but it filled the void in my stomach. 

Then came time to close my tab. I put my card in the cup about 1/2 way though my sandwich. Now granted I was there all of 30-40 minutes, but this is an airport, isn't that normal? It took another bar tender tapping her 5-6 times over the course of 5 minutes to finally get her to close the tab. Meanwhile I had finished my sandwich and just wanted the hell out of there. 

Tl/dr: decent food, but one crappy bar tender."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is the Pita Jungle of pizza. great place to meet people and be seen but the food and everything else just disappoints. The price for what you get doesn't match what they actually bring you. The place is about 10 times louder than it should be. They cram you in like sardines and uncomfortable tables. Service was nothing much better than Denny's. 

I did like the crust and the kids love the ranch....and they have a great patio if we didn't live in Phoenix. lolc"}
{"text":"Humble is a great little neighborhood hang out. Intimate and relaxing. It is a great way to lace to meet friends or go on a date night. 

My only guff is that I end up walking out half the time I go. Once they bring you water, it takes forever to get your drinks and actually putting in a food order takes so long you should order two meals. Service, while good, is very very slow. If they step that up, this easily becomes a 4 star review."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the place. High ceilings and open floor plan. All pies are made so that you can see, right in the middle of the restaurant. Can be a bit noisy so you have to really pay attention to what your guest is saying. I ordered the pepperoni and olives pizza. The pizza was descent but I felt it could have been cooked longer. The service was descent. I would go back if I was in the area but wouldnt really go out of my way to eat at this spot."}
{"text":"Staff had a very bad attitude. They were very disrespectful to my companion and I. They kept listening to out c9nversations even tho we weren't talking loud. A a female server made rude comments toward me while a male bartender told me to stop talking.  I asked him to repeat himself and he said it again. 

It is in bad firm to treat your customers like this before a flight. My companion and myself are minorities. I don't know if this was a factor or not. 

Avoid this place if you don't want to be disrespected while pay8ng high prices."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for dinner tonight since we got a free pizza in the mailer. We had the bruschetta for an app and that was very good. Then went with the pesto chicken pizza for our meal while the kids had a pepperoni pizza. Both were okay nothing out of this world. All the prices seem fair, especially the happy hour looks great. Don't think I will be coming back here again unless it's happy hour. Federal pizza is far superior!"}
{"text":"The folks at Humble Pie know how to make very good pizza! They have two locations, but I can only vouch for this particular one.  

Location ~ conveniently located across the street from the Desert Ridge Mall tucked away into the little strip center.  The restaurant is nicely decorated in a somewhat modern Italian style but the bar and patio are is the place to be!  Their bar extends outside onto the side walk and separates the dinning room from the patio. Nicely done.

Service ~ not outstanding but ok. I asked our server about the 2 for $20 deal and she stated that the special was good during the summer.  I inquired about any other offers and she stated there were none at this time.  But they do have a coupon you can print for a free pizza from their web site she failed to mention.  Our drinks never ran dry, they were very attentive to meet our needs.

Food ~ Started with a Caesar salad.  It was extremely fresh and the celery hearts made this salad more interesting with an added texture.  We had the chicken parmesan pizza with provolone, mozzarella and parm cheeses, breaded chicken on a red sauce.  It was very good. The thin crust held together very well even with the added ingredients.  Their brick oven cooks very hot so there was some great char-age around the edges.  We also had their S.O.P. pizza pie with sausage, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, ricotta and mozzarella cheese on a red sauce.  This was also an excellent choice!  The ricotta cheese and roasted red peppers gave this pie a very unique taste and high on the delish-o-meter.

They have some great beers and a modest wine selection for you to choose from.  I recommend dinning during their happy hour 3-6 to save some cash-ola on there beverages and apps. Don't forget to visit their web site to see if they have a coupon or special running.  It's a great place for pizza, salads, sandwiches and pasta's so hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Humble Pie. They have an awesome happy hour, their pizzas are delicious, and always had excellent service. The cookie skillet dessert is very good too!"}
{"text":"Very good food in a unique friendly environment. Our server was friendly and helpful. Extremely reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a big group. The speedy lunch option is a good way to go. It's only about $10 for a 9-in pizza and a soup/salad, and you'll probably get to take some of the pizza home (unless you're starving). Everything was just ok. It was good enough to eat, but I didn't fall in love with anything. Their butternut squash soup was pretty good, but it's not as good as the one I can make at home. I heard the Veggie Salad is sort of the fav, but didn't get it myself and the people who did didn't comment on it. The pizzas were also ok, but no one was ready to rave about their pizza at the end of the meal, EXCEPT for the fig pizza (sorry I don't have the official name because it's not on their website/dinner menu)!

So, for an easy, quick bite, it's probably a place to try if you're in the area. But I don't plan on going back again, and I probably wouldn't recommend it to friends considering the other great restaurants in the area (esp. at the Borgata across the street)."}
{"text":"Pretty decent, if not spectacular pizza. We're spoiled by having a few really great pizza places in town. Humble Pie isn't there yet, but it's still a pretty nice dinner.

Intentionally or not, the place still has the same vibe as The Living Room which occupied the space until earlier this year. It's a very welcoming place and the staff has always been very friendly.

The variety here is what makes the cut. If you're making pizza like this, add something other than the same three or four pizzas I can get at any restaraunt. The Pear Pizza and the Egg Pizza here (among others) provide enough variety to keep me curiously coming back.

Their non-pizza items are also quite decent, but nothing notable.

On my most recent visit, I tried the egg pizza with Italian bacon. The crust was perhaps just a bit overdone, but still had a nice crisp consistency on the bottom with a slight buttery fluff on the outside. The toppings blended well and made for a very rich pizza. so much so that I had to ask for some to go home.

The prices are maybe just a hair high, but not unacceptably so. This place won't spring to mind first when I recommend pizza in Phoenix, but the good service and decent variety will assure that I probably come back again."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar as I write this and I am already put off by them giving me a perfectly cold beer in a warm glass. Hello?? Doesn't matter if the beer is cold if you pull the glass out of hot water. Did the bar tender really not realize how warm the glass was when she picked it up. Also have an $8 glass of Malbec that is a very weak pour. Really, Malbec is the poor folks red. It's only $12 a bottle.   Price it reasonably or give a good poor. Bartender is attentive so she gets props for that. Not the happiest  person I have ever been around and not very pleasant. Got our food 4 kinds of bruschetta and wings. Bruschetta is pretty tasty. Wings were nasty. Not much flavor. Certainly not extra hot and since when did the start boiling chicken wings.  No crunch at all. Just soggy limp chicken. Lastly it's clear the manager isn't paying attention. The back bar is a mess.  Various stuff piled up, servers drinks, someone's snacks and paperwork. It looks worse than my desk and that is bad. Clean it up its a reflection on your restaurant.  Last time we eat here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the bruschetta board and the seasoned fries!  I can't remember the exact name but dang they were good!  My sister enjoyed the tuna melt and really enjoyed it!  I had a bite and loved that it had green olives in it"}
{"text":"French fries were amazing!!! Drinks are spot on! 

We had the bbq chicken pizza and the meat lovers, both were awesome!! 

Friendly staff, and quick service!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brick oven pizza. I go for their weekday lunch special - $9.95 for a smaller sized personal pizza and salad. It's perfect and I always have a little extra to take home. The different pies are each unique and amazing. I've tried them all and liked all of them. The mushroom is probably my favorite though. The staff is always quick and friendly, I've never had to wait for seating, and it's clean and casual. It's where I take all my out of town guests and I've never heard a complaint!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid choice to have an easy and good meal. The sausage pizza was really good (reminds me a bit of Pizza Bianco) and the \"one way\" mac and cheese was actually great.."}
{"text":"Fig on a pizza? Yes please!  Add some prosciutto? Yes, please some more!

Good wine, great company and thin crust that doesn't overpower the flavors on a piece of pizza pie...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth the money.  Got ours to go. The box was super light-- that's because there are hardly any toppings. Even though we paid for \"extra\".  The crust is burned and the waitress for pick up was \"sign here, thanks.\" Ridiculous. Will never make the mistake of ordering from here again.  Sadly- I could have gotten better pizza and service for $5 at Little Caesars."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy. It was awkward on arrival  as there isn't a clear hostess stand.  The inside had a stale beer smell so we sat on the patio.  It was nice.   We ordered a Caesar salad and pizza.  Salad came out slow.  we had to ask for it.  It was very good though.  Our pizza came out timely however, it was taken to the wrong table.  Oops.   The pizza was good not great.  We prefer Grimaldi's.  over all not bad we will return."}
{"text":"Very nice casual restaurant appropriate for families.  My kids (15, 12, 10) all loved it. The food was very good and both desserts were outstanding. The service was prompt and very friendly. I highly recommend Humble Pie!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I thought we'd try this place out because we purchased a Groupon. 

Once we arrived we were greeted and let us choose any table because they weren't very busy; given it was a Wednesday night. Once seated at a high top table and given menus we seemed to be ignored. 

About what felt like ten minutes passed and a lady named Kendra stopped by and asked if we've been helped. We told he we haven't and she asked if we'd like something to drink. My girlfriend and I wanted to try two draft beers. She rudely asked for our ID's and got us our tasters. While she was gone we tried the beers and looked at our Groupon on my girlfriend's cell phone and noticed it was only good at the Kierland location (no biggy). 

I had to try to make eye contact with the waitress so we could order our drinks. There were probably three other couples eating and one larger table of six (I don't believe a little better service would have been difficult). The draft beer selection was also quite poor although their extensive wine selection makes up for it...IF you're a wine drinker. 

We finally got our pizza order in as we were half way through our tasty beers and couldn't wait to dive in... we were starving at this point. 

Our pizza arrived and it looked delicious although it seemed like it should be served in a larger plate (slumping off of the sides). We ordered two waters and began eating. The pizza was delicious and the only complaint was that the pizza was a little too thin. But we really enjoyed it. 

Our waters never arrived so I flagged down another waitress and asked her for two waters. They came instantly. 

I know it sounds like I'm nitpicking this place to death but I'm not. I believe we just had a waitress that might have been new or something. We will be back and I hope we have a much better experience."}
{"text":"This was a very rare experience at an airport bar/restaurant. Great food and even better were the 2 bartenders, Stacy and Ginger. I've been to so many places in airports and have never had a better time. Fun conversation started with those 2 and everyone else at the bar just having a good time. The only thing that sucks is that I can't frequent this place unless I'm traveling. Not sure how important these reviews are to the upper management, but KEEP THESE 2. Thanks for a really fun experience when I was expecting the usually grumpy airport employee."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Kids are free on Sundays, which was an added bonus.  Didn't try the pizza on this visit - we had pastas, which were flavorful and filling.  

I agree that the dining room is a little small, and the hanging lamps obscure the TV screens.  Other than that, nothing bad to say about this restaurant.  This place will definitely be one that we frequent."}
{"text":"Horrible...  $16.99 plus tax for the worst little pizza I've had in recent memory.  The crust is decent but that's where the good ends.  Despite being cooked to order, it didn't look or taste fresh.

Never thought I'd say this but I miss the Pizza Hut Express which used to be in the airport.  I'd suggest going to Delux for a burger instead."}
{"text":"Way over priced and the menu is a joke. Might as well hand over your wallet when you sit down. A cheese pizza is $11.99 but a pepperoni is $16.49? Keep in mind it's only a 10 inch pizza. I get we are at the airport but this should be illegal."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is great and the happy hour is better! My only complaint is that it is hot in Phoenix and the misters haven't worked on the patio for awhile. The patio is the best if you're cool. Leah is a great waitress. We've had her twice now and she's very attentive. I love the fried green beans!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst food I've ever had in my life I don't know how this has a rating I would never have rated this a one if I could possibly write it -5 I would this is the worst pizza I've ever had. They got a one because their service is great. But the inside of the restaurant smells like septic system or bathroom. And the food is much to be desired.  I don't recommend this to anyone unless you have a cast-iron stomach and don't care what you eat."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really like this place.  Yesterday I sat in the back part of the dining room near the pizza oven.  What made this nice was that it was a cold rainy day and I could see into the wood-fired oven which made it feel like I was in front of a cozy fireplace.

I tried the egg pizza with prosciutto and mozzarella.  This is my new favorite at Humble Pie.  The flavors go together very well and the leftovers were perfect for breakfast the next morning.

I noticed that they have a good happy hour menu and half priced bottles of wine on Mondays which I'll have to check out in the near future."}
{"text":"I ordered the meatlovers pizza to go. The pizza was ready on time and extremely fresh! I am a particular for quality toppings and cheese. Their toppings were premium!"}
{"text":"The lunch express special is perfect for lunch and reasonably priced. The chopped salad is superb!"}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are outstanding. Always have great service with Jack! Definitely recommend you having him as your server! Shock top is on draft which is always a plus and their fries are beyond organismic in your mouth. Highly recommend stopping in and getting a beer/cocktail and some food!"}
{"text":"So on one of those nights where I am the \"loser\" solo diner, where does one go?  What if you are looking for a killer $20 beer + carb/protein yummy meal before tomorrow's half-marathon?

You sit at the bar, and in the service of Grant the bartender, you enjoy a pint of Four Peaks \"Raj\" IPA and the Penne w/Vodka sauce, mushrooms, pancetta, and add the chix. You politely respect but don't participate in the hoots and hollars of the locals drunk at the bar from several hours of reveling. In doing so, you focus on the quality of food, service, and convenience-all winners here!

Very nicely done, HP.  And Grant, you were placed in a tough situation as the local drunks did little to encourage more activity there at your bar, but you navigated the waters nicely.  BravO, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with a server's laziness on my first visit. Another waitress apologized profusely. I swore I would be back because the food was delicious. I found out the bad server no longer works there. This visit's server was super attentive, not pushy and the food was still top notch. Another visit with this good of service and I will give a five star."}
{"text":"Went there twice last week with friends who were visiting from out of town.  The first time we went for lunch and enjoyed their lunch specials.  I had the chopped salad with the prosciutto and pear pizza.  It was amazing.  My friends tried the veggie salad and the BLT pizza (she subbed arugula for lettuce).  Everyone was raving about their meals.

A few days later I came back for dinner.  We shared a couple bottles of wine and again had the chopped salad and veggie salad, this time with chicken added.  We ordered the tempura stringbeans for an appetizer and enjoyed every bite!  For dessert we indulged in the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream.  It was decadent.  Service was friendly and attentive.

We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"How have I never been to Humble Pie is beyond me! I know that I will definitely be   coming back again very soon. Their bartenders are great, even if they did continue to call me by the wrong name no matter how many times I corrected them. Plus they have happy hour everyday from 11-6 for drinks and 3-6 for food. SOLD! Sitting on their patio on a hot summer day was actually quite pleasant thanks to the misters.. Yep I definitely look forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Decent, but not out of this world. I'd rather go to Grimmaldi's for pizza.
Went with some friends on a Friday evening. I expected to wait a bit so I wasn't surprised when we were told the wait for our group of 6 would be 30-35 minutes. 55 minutes (and several complaints later) we were seated. The place was LOUD with nothing at all in the decor to dampen the sound.
Service was good- we ordered bruschetta and calamari for appetizers. The bruschetta was probably the best thing I had all night. Unique flavors, but a bit stingy at 2 large slices of toast for $6.95. The calamari came with a basil chili-type dipping sauce that I didn't care for. The calamari itself was a bit on the bland and chewy side. As for the pizza, we had sort of mixed experiences. Our friend ordered the one with all sorts of breakfast meats and a fried egg on top. He thought it was great- I tried a piece and thought it was way too salty (not surprising with all of the meat on top). Hubby had the one with figs on it. He said it was good. They originally got my order wrong and brought me a second fig pizza. When I asked for it to be corrected they brought me my pear and gorgonzola pizza on the house. It was good, but not great. Too much gorgonzola (which is a very strong flavor) and not enough pear. The crust was also a bit dry and bland for my taste."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The salad was small. The sausage pizza was very good. Sitting behind a wall at a two top table without view of the tv was terrible when the NBA playoffs are on. Very few opportunities to charge electronic devices. Finished my meal and went to another bar for beers, charged devices and watched the game. If this was available here, I wouldn't have left and spent my money in another restaurant."}
{"text":"Please, please change the music.
I love Pie, but this Playlist has been on loop for months.....and it is AWFUL.  PLEASE just switch back to what ever it was before. I can only imagine the torture it is to work here and be forced to hear this for hours and hours, days and days...months and months on end. I might stab my ear drums.

Ok updated review to reflect music, not my service."}
{"text":"Best wood fired pizza we have ever eaten. The crust is outstanding, the sauce was fresh and not processed, pepperoni was seasoned well. The service was top notch, waitress was attentive without being overbearing we will absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"Had a long layover around lunch time and the menu had options that sounded good. Ordered a Moscow mule based on the ad in their drink menu. The waitress proceeded to tell me they don't carry ginger beer but can use a ginger vodka with ginger ale. I agreed to try it. She then came back and said they were out of ginger vodka so basically the drink would be plain vodka with ginger ale. I didn't care at that point. It was fine but not a Moscow mule.

I ate the sourdough burger with fries. It was good but not anything special. It did take a while for the food to get to me and the fries were not warm. Would probably go somewhere else if i was in the same situation again."}
{"text":"Our new favorite happy hour in Hilton Village shopping center. Not a new place, but their house wines by the glass are great quality for the price ($5) and their premiere beers on tap are 32 ounces and only $3. Happy hour menu includes salads, personal size pizzas, etc. Indoor and outdoor and bar seating. A nice place to hit after work or shopping, just don't get there too close to the end of happy hour at 6pm or you'll miss out! Also great for lunch or dinner if you miss happy hour - pizzas and salads to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just average pizzas are good 11 dollar wedge not so much. My advice is maybe lower the cost of a wedge salad to fit in with the pizza heavy menu not at a high end steak house price or serve it on a nice plate to show some perceived value to the guest"}
{"text":"we have been coming to this location for years. Great food, great service, great happy hour! You just cant go wrong. Their French fries are the best in town, I don't even eat fries but I sure eat theirs! The pep pizza is great, the drinks are strong, and reasonably priced. We will always come back here, cheers!"}
{"text":"this location is down the road from my work....i love to stop here for dinner! the schreiner's pizza is amazing! the staff is very friendly!!! love love it here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in between flights and had a surprisingly good pizza. It was clearly made on the spot, and had piping hot fresh ingredients, and a nice balance of flavored, and a really good red sauce. (I got the S.O.P. - a sausage, Carmelized onion, and fresh mozzarella).

The downside is that they're applying the standard airport markup and it's a bit of a ripoff. Two beers (from a small, but quality selection of draughts) and a pizza were $42 with a standard tip. About 20% more than it's worth, but that's life in the terminal.

I'd come here again if stuck in terminal c. Maybe try the burgers next time, which are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I didn't eat the food. However I had a couple of beers. The service was perfect.  The beer was cold.  I was on a layover and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with Humble Pie. We used to love the Vodka Penne but noticed it was off the menu. We asked the waiter and he said they could still do it, no problem.  It was not nearly as good as before and we added chicken which came out as a dry sliced chicken breast on top.  Also ordered the meatballs app which came out just warm with a sprinkle of  parmesan that looked like it was out of a can. The cheesy bread appetizer was the best thing. We also had a kiddo with us but didn't notice until we were leaving the sign that said kids eat free on Sunday.  Since she's only 2 we don't usually get her a meal but it would have been nice if they had told us.  For $50+ I'll go someplace else next time."}
{"text":"Im going to review the food only. 

The strawberry & gorgonzola salad was absolutely amazing.  Most of the time you order a salad with \"berries\" in it and you might find a trace of the fruit.  Not here, this salad must of had 6 or more strawberries thinly sliced.  Every bite had a strawberry!!!!  I could not really taste the dressing but overall I was amazed by the salad.  I told my buddy that \"I could not remember the last time I had a good salad\".

The pizza was great as usual.  I had the artichoke pizza.  Great chewy crust.  In fact the crust is so good I eat every bite.

This place makes great little designer pizzas.  I couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Still fairly new to PHX exploring restaurants. Decided to use UberEATS for delivery with friends. Service from Uber was great. Food was another story! So disappointed! If this is any indication what there restaurant is like yuck! I would never go there! Mac and cheese over priced crap! The portion was small too! It was nothing but penne with alfredo poured over. No flavor. Salad same thing over priced and minimum the pizza .....ugh need I go on."}
{"text":"We went in a Saturday late afternoon and it wasn't busy at all.  Service was great, food was yummy and timely and there was no problem using our Groupon.  We got a sausage pizza, mozz bites and the cookie ice cream for dessert.  They have lots of specials and we'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This airport location appears to be very popular.   We enjoyed the pizza (BBQ Chicken and Margherita).  The crust was good - chewy with some crispiness.  

Sitting at the bar seems to be a free for all.  Although there were people standing in line waiting to be seated (including at the bar), others bypassed the line to grab a bar seat."}
{"text":"Shrimp pizza is great and for some reason I liked their chopped salad.  Maybe it's because of the pizza and salad deal at lunch time.  

Good variety of pizza and the crust is always nicely done.  Service is friendly."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Humble Pie last Saturday evening... I had plans with Christina P and after reading her review, I asked if she'd be interested in returning to Humble Pie with me since she had several positive experiences there already...

I arrived first, and was seated right away.  The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us.  We started with  a glass of prosecco each and decided to share the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and the shrimp pie.  Sounds like a ton of food, but it was perfect for the two of us.  I eat a lot - especially of veggies, and I love that HP has a large selection when it comes to veggies and salads... I have to return soon to try the butternut squash and the veggie salad (both sounded great to me).

I'll preface this by saying, I like the flavor of burnt food.  So, the fact that the brussel sprouts were a tad bit overdone, was fine with me... although for other patrons, it may not be so appealing.  The cauliflower was not burnt, but it didn't have so much flavor either.  Regardless, I wanted to get my vegetables in for the day, and they seemed fresh despite the way they were cooked.  Does that make sense?

As some of the yelpers before me commented, we noticed the use of lemon zest in our shrimp pie.  It was light on the shrimp, sauce, and cheese, but it did have a zesty flavor to it.  I added some chili pepper flakes and parmesan as well... mmmm.

As if I hadn't eaten enough food, Christina requested a small sample of the olive oil gelato so I could taste it... and I actually enjoyed it!  If you're open to trying something new, the olive oil gelato is the perfect sweet ending to your meal at Humble Pie.

My 4 star rating is for my overall experience at Humble Pie - I was in fantastic company, a casual environment (which I love), and lots of veggie options to choose from... the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit.

I also noticed that there is plenty of bar seating for those that like to sit at the bar, hang with the bartender, etc... good to know in case I ever return solo!  Either way, I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I frequently visit the Humble Pie in Scottsdale (Hilton Village) and the one at the airport, and both have always been consistent.  There is plenty to choose from on the menu from salads, soups, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, additional entrees and sides, etc... and an extensive wine list / full bar too! 

Some favorite items that I've ordered again and again are:
-Butternut Squash Soup
-Humble Pretzel Appetizer
-Chopped Salad 
-Veggie Salad
-Pizza (any kind)

On a recent visit to this (Desert Ridge) location, I ordered food for take-out, and it worked out great.  Five of us shared a pizza, a large Chopped Salad, and a Spaghetti & Meatballs.  The order was ready when I arrived and still hot by the time I returned to my MIL's house around the corner.  Everyone enjoyed as usual!

Note: Humble Pie is going to be pricier than ordering pizza and salad from a national chain... that being said, I think it's well worth the extra money for the quality, selection, and local flavor.

Bonus tips: After revisiting the Humble Pie website, I see two things worth noting:
-Humble Pie offers a \"Humble Hearts\" program where they will work with patrons to \"meet, eat, and raise goodwill funds for your favorite non-profit school, church, arts and athletic programs.  Love that (and may have to look into this!)
-Kids 12 and under eat free (one free item from the kids menu) on Sunday!

Even more reason to keep Humble Pie in my family's rotation!"}
{"text":"They were busy when we came in so we sat at the bar and had the BEST service! Came in right at the end of Happy Hour but got a round of drinks and appetizer at the HH price. I had the meat lover pizza and Hubby had the sourdough burger and both were amazing and delicious!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I started out with the meatballs as an appetizer, my dad stated grocery store meatballs tasted better. I thought they were okay, nothing to write home about. For the main meal, I had the caprice sandwich, it was tasty, actually a nice spin on the salad. My daughter had the cheese pizza. Let's just say my family was not a fan of this place and for the price the food could have been better. My daughter stated her pizza tasted like store bought pizza. I didn't try it, but I take her word for it. If I'm on that side of town again, I may try the pizza. I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we try this new pizza place in the Hilton Shopping Center on Scottsdale Rd. for our regular Sunday night dinner.  I love trying new restaurants, and so off we went.  Upon entering, we saw a cute restaurant with a great indoor/outdoor bar, plenty of outdoor seating and inside tables with comfortable chairs.

The appetizers (green beans with mustard and crispy french fries) were delicious, the chopped salad was refreshing, but nothing to write home about, and we ordered three pizzas (margharita, pepperoni, and shrimp)  All were yummy, toppings were good, dough was great, but I felt like they skimped a little with the toppings.  The crust was very wide and so I felt like half the pizza was more like a bread stick.

I would go back again, but maybe only for happy hour (half price wines and beers, maybe some appetizers) but felt for the dinner price, the pizza didn't live up to my desires."}
{"text":"Ate here passing thru from LA to Chicago. This was the second time I've eaten their pizza. I order \"cheese and sausage\"... although it's not on the menu, per se, they happily make it. Personal pizza and a soda was around $16. Not bad considering you're in an airport where prices are always high.
The pizza came out in about 8 minutes. Crispy and hot! Very tasty too.

Everyone's entitled to their opinions and I'm not here to refute my fellow Yelpers but my 2 visits were great! It's a very welcome change from fast food burgers. Suggest you try their pizza if you're in the Phoenix airport!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed!!! The food was great and I would love to come back, but unfortunately now I won't. My boyfriend and I stopped in last night and were greeted promptly. To her credit, our server was very nice (despite not smiling at us once). My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the meatball pizza. My bf's order came out solo. The server's explanation (gesturing at the pizza maker) was, \"He kinda destroyed your meatball pizza. He's going to make you another one.\" 

Ok, I totally understand that these things happen. But it would have been nice to get an apology. My bf and I shared his spaghetti and meatballs, but had I known we'd be sharing, maybe I wouldn't have ordered a MEATBALL pizza. OR maybe offer us another drink and to keep his plate warm until my entree was ready (so we can eat at the same time? Crazy idea.)

When my pizza finally arrived (after my bf's plate was finished), I still received no apology or hint of any possible inconvenience. I know this is awful, but I was shocked when the bill came and was charged the full $12.50 for my tardy pizza pie. (I'd like to add that I totally don't expect anything for free! Simply an acknowledgment of the problem.)

Too bad because it was delicious. But with gourmet pizza a-plenty downtown, service is key. To Humble Pie: a simple and friendly, \"sorry about that!\" goes a long way."}
{"text":"Good, especially the starter fries. I tried the fries and cheese bread from the appetizer menu, the caesar's salad, the meat lovers pizza, and the fig and prosciutto pizza. 
My least favorite wad the fig and prsciutto, but it was my husbands favorite haha. Crust was really good, meats were good, cheese was delicious. I recommend. Was it the best pizza in the world, no, was it good and will I be back for more? Yes! Definitely the fries."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, tasty food every time (favs include the caprese, fried green beans and pizza), friendly service!"}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix from San Diego for the Sf Giants spring training. We got in late and we were starving! We originally wanted a quick bite and headed to Panda Express. They were closed but Humble Pie was there to our rescue next door and open until 10. Phew! We walked in and it smelled delicious. It was hour before close and there was just one group ahead of us so we got seated right away.

Service was mediocre but prompt. Which was fine enough because we just wanted to eat. My in-laws ordered the BLT and the butter but squash soup, hubby ordered the strawberry spinach salad with chicken added and I like to try signature items so I ordered the HP Sausage Sandwich with seasoned fries. Everyone said they liked their food but my mother in laws soup was lukewarm so she asked if they could nuke it. He looked her like she was crazy and asked \"wouldn't you rather just get a new bowl?\". Hey give the lady what she wants and don't sass her, geez!! But other than that she enjoyed it. You have the option of seasoned or plain for fries. I opted for the seasoned and boy was I stoked when they arrived. They looked good and tasted amazing! I couldn't stop eating them and forgot about my sandwich. I eventually remembered and dove in to the sandwich. It was dry but tasted okay. Ambience was great, food in general was pretty good and service wasn't bad but just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, desserts and good selection of wines. They have wine bottle specials on Mondays and we will be checking that out for the first time today. Been there on a handful of times and have never been disappointed. My mother in law suffers from celiac, she has to have their gluten free crust and says it's the best she's had anywhere. She's from New Jersey so it must be pretty decent"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time the other day for lunch with my co workers. Service and food was very good and they have great lunch specials so I decided to come back a few days later. 

I ordered the $9 lunch special to go. I also got the toasted ravioli appetizer which I did not like. The ends were very hard and tasted freezer burned. For the entree I got the caprese half sandwich with a Caesar salad. The sandwich was amazing with roasted tomato, fresh mozzarella, pesto, and basalmic. Had a ton of flavor and good crunch of the sourdough bread. The salad was good as well. They serve it with a small lemon wedge to squeeze on salad which made it refreshing. 

Overall everything was tasty and I will be back just will skip the ravioli appetizer."}
{"text":"Finally, good pizza in Phoenix. Pizza is about 10-13$, Sandwiches are about $10. Pizza is the best I had in Phoenix. Ambiance can be fixed a bit, it is kinda confusing if it is a bar or a family dining..."}
{"text":"Garbage food (see pics)

The blonde man who took my order was funny and a joy at 5am but the food was so sad for eleven bucks and made me sick to my stomach allllll day. I would have gone back for a refund but my flight was leaving- worst 1- bucks I've ever spent... the open box is how it was handed to me with the potatoes and fruit liking half eaten. RAWR."}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome and the appetizer was also very good! Great place to have a drink and a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here with an employee that no longer works there. When David the owner found out about it, he personally came to apologize and make it right. He was extremely genuine and just wanted to fix anything that was wrong. He really went above and beyond what I would expect out of any business owner. The food is also amazing. Try the fig and prosciutto pizza, it's delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at in Phoenix! Everything I have had on their menu has been so tasty and amazing! The pizza, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers keep me coming back for more. My family and I are OBSESSED with their French fries from the appetizer menu. We love them so much we call them \"crack fries.\" We always ask for extra aioli because it is the best! I love the pizza and the fresh taste of the sauce. So delicious, and always perfectly cooked. I always look forward to coming back to Humble Pie and trying something new, or sticking to my favorites."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier with my first visit to Humble Pie.  The service was friendly and attentive and the food was exceptional. The bruschetta was excellent. A ton of creative, delicious pizzas are sure to make me a return customer!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, fries and salad.  The service was great!  I will be back often!  Simply awesome."}
{"text":"We have been to Humble Pie a couple times during their 3-6pm happy hour, where they are currently offering half price food and 20% off drinks.  We both enjoyed the thin, chewy crust, brick oven pizzas.  The sausage one was a little heavy on meat for my taste, but I really like the goat cheese and roasted red pepper (we added chicken, too).  Both times we have sat at the bar and had great service.  

If you had gone to the other pizza place that was in this location (bravo), the new owners have totally changed the look and feel...in a good way.  The service (at least at the bar), and the food are way better than Bravo.  

I would definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"The positives out-weigh the negatives for us.  The only things I would complain about would be: my salad (veggie) was very unfresh, like very unfresh.  The lettuce tasted and looked old, it seemed like it was dressed four hours before I ordered it, because everything was soft.... pains me to confess but I still ate it... hahah!! but to be fair I was STARVING!! hahah!! and if it were fresh it would be a great salad.  The bathrooms were not clean.  These two things were troubling, but we still enjoyed our meal, the SOP was very good, pepperoni was good, kids meal corn dogs were very good, our waitress was GREAT, we would go back, especially with their frequent groupons :)"}
{"text":"I was first exposed to Humble Pie at a local festival being held in the Duck & Decanter parking lot. They were handing out free samples of bruschetta and it was so tasty we snuck back for seconds...and thirds. It took me a while, but I eventually made it to one of their actual restaurants. 

I'm surprised at how much I like this place. Their menu is basically my heaven. Bruschetta, pizza, sandwiches, caprese, and alcohol. DONE.

And the best part of that tasty menu? Their food is actually really good. And so is the service. On my first visit here we had an adorable, flirty server who made me feel like I was 21 and the second time we had a girl who was super quick and helpful. Wish I remembered their names!

The atmosphere is a little lacking in style. It definitely strikes me as chain-ish decor, but it isn't bad. I do enjoy the high top tables. Overall, I really like Humble Pie and will continue to come back. Mainly for their awesome menu and delicious food, but maybe because of that cute waiter too! ;)"}
{"text":"Good pizza, though not excellent. Nice place for families for a pizza dinner outing. However, reason for 3 stars was poor service. It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to be served. At the 25 minute mark after the order was taken, our server told us that the kitchen was backed up due to a large take out order. We should have been told at the outset of this issue and given the opportunity to order something else. When the pizza was served, it was hot and cooked as we requested. The salad we ordered was to be shared and they nicely divided it for us on to 2 plates which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"For airport food this place deserves 4 stars in my opinion: very clean and organized and the guy in the counter super friendly, fast yet very attentive. I picked up a salad before my flight and all the ingredients were very fresh, plus the vinaigrette dressing was the perfect blend. The strawberries in the salad were like just picked up from the field, red and plumply and the whole package was abundantly filled with various ingredients, like the pecans. I was very satisfied also with the raspberry drink, very thick, good blend and delicious. The layout of this restaurant is a little bit on the narrow side but everything else looks good."}
{"text":"Had lunch with kids.  Fantastic service.  Lunch specials are great.  Food is amazing.  Love this place.   Great place for kids.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Uptown area hands down! Get in my belly!! They also have a summer special where you buy a pizza and get the second one half off!"}
{"text":"French fries at Humble Pie? OH YES! Stopped for a quick snack and Bloody Mary before a flight- so pleasantly surprised by both. Quick, personal and friendly service. TDF shoestring fries. I love the Phx airport dining options!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite at lunch with really good prices for lunch specials. Soup and salad, small pizza, or soup and half sandwich are less than $10! All ingrediants are fresh and the service is friendly and fast. Never have to wait for food more than 5-10 minutes a the most."}
{"text":"Dashing through the airport to catch a flight, I grabbed their strawberry and Gorgonzola salad.  What luck!  It was so fresh and flavorful.  I became so obsessed with it that I looked up their other AZ locations.  I was not a huge fan of Gorgonzola before but this salad has converted me."}
{"text":"My son wanted to treat his boyfriend and me to dinner, wanted something near the theater we were headed too and something they haven't tried.  I saw Humble Pie was in the area and asked if they were game and yes they were. Now I have heard good sold things about Humble Pie from many friends so I was pretty excited to try them out.  

It was Sunday night around 5:30, we walked in and where greeted right away and asked how many in the party, then the host turned his back , a server walked up and asked how many in the party, I had to answer because it appeared the host had better things to do, why even ask if you didn't even care.

We were seated handed menus and drink orders were taken.  For appetizers I ordered the toasted ravioli,  they were stuffed with ricotta cheese and served with marinara sauce. To be honest this dish lacked flavor, Prego sauce has more flavor that the marinara sauce that came with it.  1/2 the raviolis were toasted perfectly, the other were just hard. Even though the dish looked great the dish didn't wow me.
 
My son ordered the lasagna, which was the winning dish of the night, everything cooked perfectly!  His date ordered the Penne with Vodka Sauce with chicken (5 buck upcharge, when it came out it looked like adding the chicken to the dish was an afterthought, it was just a chicken breast diced up lying on top of the pasta. The sauce had great color but lacked flavor. 

Since I was at Humble Pie, pie is what I am getting right?  Wood oven cooked pizza sounded amazing!  I ordered the bbq chicken pizza with smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green onions and bbq sauce, the bbq chicken is one of my favorite types of pizza, so I was pretty excited. When I got my pizza it looked pretty amazing, but when I started to eat it, I noticed it was covered with grease, even my crust was soaked in grease, I couldn't eat it all, my belly was becoming a grease pit, it was just too much for me.  


Our server was never around (it wasn't that busy) the food was ok, the place looks like a lot of fun, the lasagna rocked, but my return rate very low."}
{"text":"Sky Harbor excellent pizza, light fluffy crust. Great fire wood pizza!!  Great customer service by Hilary!!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and shiny.  We were seated quickly and then waited for 15 mins before we got our drink orders.  The service was slow for lunch.  Had to ask for refills a few times.

Fried Mozzarella:  flash fried, house-made mozzarella, with tomato dipping sauce.  These things are super crispy and good.

Steak & Turkey Chili:  black & white beans, tomato, onion, spices, sour cream.
The server said it was not spicy but YES it was.  And it didn't taste good.  

Meat Lovers Pizza:  OK, pizza was awesome.  It get a little soggy 1/2 way through the pizza."}
{"text":"Dull, boring, predictable, bland, not even average at best. Have been hearing about this place for awhile and gotta say why the hype? There are so many places around the entire Phoenix area that serve this same kind of food that are average or better. I say try another and skip this one."}
{"text":"I have traveled the world and never found a pizza that matches the flavor explosion until now! I had the egg pizza with prosciutto. WOW!!! Each and every single bite was more impressive than the last. Not only will Humble Pie be my forever favorite, I will tell everyone that is willing to listen!!"}
{"text":"Ordered everything vegetarian style but was surprised with a slice of sausage meatball at the bottom of my mariana sauce (I had already eaten most of it). I told the waiter who apologized immediately, explaining that there are two types of marinara that they serve and we must have gotten meat by mistake. He asked if we wanted more mariana for our cheesy bread. With reserve, I said yes. It pretty much ruined the experience for me. I used my knife to explore the new mariana sauce for mystery meat floating in it.  They did not offer to comp anything - I had to ask. Most restaurant managers make the first move, but even when we suggested we should not have to pay for the dish he said he would \"see what he could do.\" In the end they did comp the dish, however the experience left a literal bad taste in my mouth...I would expect a more sincere response and sensitivity to various dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot to grab a yummy pizza!  The pizzas are great and so is the service.  The strawberry gorgonzola salad is delicious and you can't resist their Pizza cookie hot out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Go here and try the pizza. Brick baked.  Meatball pizza is fantastic.  Margherita pizza is awesome. Olive pizza is amazing and I have run out of adjectives.

Tricia - we miss you!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service and atmosphere is terrible. You don't feel welcome, you feel as though you are intruding on the staff somehow. Our waitress acted like we were idiots anytime we asked a simple question like the size of the pizza that came with the lunch special. It was very clear she didn't want to wait on us, let alone answer questions. Would have liked to come back and try other pizzas, but with an atmosphere like that there is ZERO chance we will."}
{"text":"Two stars based on food alone. The pizza and appetizers were awesome but service was beyond lacking. Our waitress seemed annoyed at us being there, never smiled and had zero customer service. Every time we spoke to her it was painful but seriously the food was spot on- doubt we'd ever dine here again but may get take out occasionally."}
{"text":"I came in after a long day and flight delay of three hours. They helped solve all my problems. They were very courteous with letting me taste wines until I was satisfied with a blend of silver Palm. 

I was able to get a decent amount of work done on my computer while at the bar. Which was duely needed!! 

The pesto chicken pizza is to die for and is a must have. The meatballs were also delicious."}
{"text":"Airport food is usually a bummer.

This isn't. It's so good I would seek it out in the civilian world.

The cheese pizza with fresh, melted mozzarella is amazing.

My picky four year old even loved it, except for the occasional burn mark on the crust - the same burn marks that made it extra awesome for me.

Woodfired pizza in the airport makes even a very delayed flight just a little better."}
{"text":"Pizza is average - they use the \"sweet\" sauce which I do not care for. Pomo is better. Service was very slow and not very nice."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited when they were out of the wine I requested. Both times I was offered the more expensive label of the same grape as an alternative. A kind gesture one might say!  Until you see that they charged the higher amount on your bill. If it were my restaurant, I would only charge for the less expensive wine as a way to say \"I'm sorry we were out of your wine.\"  Also, the minestrone soup cup is tiny.  Please offer a bowl."}
{"text":"Family of 6 for dinner and we had a long wait time like an hour for dinner and there is no where to sit while you wait. Food was nothing special. I had 2 groupons and let 1 expire since I hated this place so much and will not return."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from friends and especially my sister.  She works nearby and frequents this establishment for lunch.  She has always wanted to take me because she thought it would be something that I would like.  There were coupons at work today so I grabbed one and told my sister and her family that we were going tonight.  Anticipation and expectation elevated at this point, as you could imagine, with all the talk surrounding this place.  We arrived around 6:30 and it was packed.  No surprise.  I'm sure everybody in that place had a coupon just like we did.  The marketing was working well and traffic was up.  We brought my 2 year old niece so we had to wait a while since they would not let a small child sit at a high top.  Understood.  We grabbed a round of drinks and waited patiently.  I could tell the manager was aware of our long wait time because he moved from behind the bar and started to bus a table as soon as it became available to get us seated.

Finally we're seated.  We were greeted by our waiter promptly, our order was taken and we were served drinks.  All is fine so far.  We receive and eat our salad.  Next up....pizza!  We waited and watched as others around us (who arrived after us) received their pies.  We begin to wonder what is going on.  Our waiter comes over and communicates very openly and honestly with us, \"Sorry, but the pizza is taking longer than anticipated.  The manager will comp your pizzas tonight.\"  Ok.  Fine.  We can live with that.  We wait longer........and longer.  Our server approaches us and says, \"Sorry, your pizza came out, but I sent it back because it was burnt.  I did not want to serve that to you guys.\"  Ok cool.  I don't want burnt pizza so good call.  So we wait even longer.  FINALLY, another young blonde gentlemen approaches with two pizzas in hand.  This HAS to be our pizza!!!  It is.  He sets them down on our table and asks, \"Anything else I can get for you?\"  I replied simply, \"Plates.\"  He looked at us (he clearly heard us) gave no acknowledgment whatsoever, turned and walked away to never be seen again.  Now here we are sitting with the pizza that we had been waiting for a VERY long time as it grew cold in front of us with no plates to eat of off.  We look around, wave our arms and try to get some attention.  Enough was enough.  My sister got up and complained to the manager and asked somebody else for plates.  They finally comply and we get to eat.  Very unhappy at this point.

The server was apologetic and told us our meal would be comped.  The manager and our server were courteous and dealt with the situation the best they could.  For their consideration, I give this restaurant 2 stars.  Otherwise, the ignorant and lazy young blonde fellow that blatantly ignored our plate request is a case-in-point as to how one bum of an employee can ruin an entire dining experience for patrons.  Because of him, I will never dine at this place again.  

Finally, for my money, Grimaldi's is a far better pizza.  Don't buy the hype on \"Humble Pie\"."}
{"text":"I ordered the Margherita and it was pretty solid pizza but not amazing. The crust is chewy and tasty but I wish it was a touch crunchier. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I reached my Groupon expiration date.  I flew solo on this one and Im glad that I did.  The place is small, relaxed, and casual, but great for a small group of friends/family.  I was seated immediately and my waiter was very friendly, attentive and direct, just as I like.  I ordered the bread and the pepperoni pizza.  I rarely order pepperoni.  This was probably the best pepperoni pizza I've had.  The slices were perfect circles and the flavor was great, not too overwhelming.  Sauce had great flavor also.  The cheese bread was great, though didn't stick out in my mind.  This would be a great lunch date, or date night place."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was very disappointed. ..we had been wanting to try it for a while and so we finally did.  The food was just ok...The toppings slide off the pizza...watered down sauce.  Pretzels were the best part of the meal.  Food a side we would have given it another try but the service was terrible.   We had the unfortunate opportunity to be served by Patrick.   Rudest service I have probably ever had in a restaurant.   Ignored us for the majority of service.   We are not a high maintenance family by any means.  Stopped by after 15 minutes of sitting there.  I told him we had never been here and asked for a recommendation. ..He said he didn't have any.  Our pizza sat on the counter for a good 5 minutes before someone (not our server) dropped it off.  That was the last we were helped. I had to track Patrick down to get my check.  Then he brought the check set it down without saying a word and walked away.  Finally came back to run our card after another long wait and basically slammed the check down and left. ..no thank you please come again. ..no attempt to smile nothing was very strange and rude...you do realize that you work for tips for a living right? Wouldn't want you to go out of your way to do your job! We will never return.  You only get 1 first impression.   Find another job that suits you better Patrick so you can be happy.  I can stay home and cook but if I go out to eat I do expect to be treated like my business matters."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite spots for a neighborhood restaurant, decent food, friendly service and good location.  After more than 5 years coming here almost monthly , I'm sad to say I'll never be back.  Now the only thing going for it is it's convenient location.  I believe in supporting local restaurants, but my only hope is a new local restaurant will take its place."}
{"text":"I've  been to several of their locations throughout the Valley and hands down, one of the best pies around! I haven't tried their other food but why would I when this place is known for their pizza? Pizza's are on the smaller side but their pizza menu is fantastic...highly recommend the mushroom & pancetta pizza! Service is spotty depending on which location and time of day you go but overall very good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Good service, easy parking, delicious light pizza.

Parking: Teeny tiny little lot shared with another restaurant.  We parked on the street. 

Atmosphere: Medium to loud / fun.  It's pretty small inside. 

Service:  The wait staff are attentive, yet they were a bit hovering.  

Food:  I ordered a vegetable-based pizza. It was crisp, cheesy, and delicious.  I also ordered the cold garlic green beans; I did not like them much.  My friend ordered calamari as his app but did not share, so I have no idea.  He did enjoy his sangria.  

Drinks: I have only had water so don't know if drinks are good or not."}
{"text":"Solid gourmet brick oven pizzas, good craft brews on tap, friendly service, and a covered patio. What's not to like? Consistently good, and the Pizza & Salad lunch combos are a nice change of pace. Had the Meat Lovers pie this weekend, and it is pork-tastic."}
{"text":"I used to live by this Humble Pie and never went. Now that I live downtown I finally make it there? Go figure. I met the venerable Richard Z for lunch today. The other leg of the \"Tripod\", Dallas G was missing. The place wasn't too busy for lunch, but it was about 130 so the lunch rush may have already ended. We sat out on the patio since it was a typical 70 degree December day. Nice patio that is probably perfect at night. 

The menu had salads, pastas, and of course pizzas. They offer a pretty good lunch special of an 8\" pizza and salad for $8.95. They have specific pizzas for this on specific days, but our server said we could have any pizza we wanted. I give credit to Mr. Z and his charm for that. I decided on the Artichoke which had fontina and ricotta cheese, 3 different olives, and caramelized onions. I got the Veggie salad which had jicima, romaine, tomatoes, green beans, avacado, white beans, and fresh mozzarella with a herb vinagrette. The salad was very tasty. Z had the Cesar which he noted that the croutons were amazing. He subsequently bit his tongue in half following this statement. There was blood and everything.

Our pizzas came out before we were done with the salads, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Mine was very good, but I wish the crust wasn't as bready and a little more well done. Otherwise perfectly delicious. Z got the Egg pizza which had a sunny side up egg and panceta. He seemed very pleased with his selection. I could tell by the sounds coming from across the table. I also enjoyed one of the iciest Stellas I have ever had. Perfect for a day like today.

Overall a very good experience and I would definitely come back to this location or any of the others throughout the valley. Well done Humble Pie."}
{"text":"We have always loved coming to Humble Pie.  We ordered take out and when we opened the pizza box the crust was burnt.  The bottom of the pizza was all charred. I called to let them know and the manager offered me a free pizza on our next visit. 

We decided to have dinner last Friday night. Sigh...the service was awful. We dined outside and they were not very busy.  We order a diet coke and a glass of wine. Took about ten minutes for my wine. We ordered an appetizer and two pizza's. My husband's pizza came out first.  Around 10 plus minutes went by and I asked another waiter if he could check on my food.  My waiter came out and said there was a mix up and it would be two minutes.  10 minutes later my pizza came out. My husband was finished with his as I did not want his pizza to get cold.   Our waiter had no energy and seemed bothered that he was working.   His attitude stunk!  You could tell the other tables around us that had him as a waiter were a bit irritated.  They did comp my pizza which was nice of them.  But I found it strange that a manager never came out to apologize or explain what happened.

I can't tell you how many times we have dinned her in the past but no more.   Looking at other reviews it looks like I am not the only one commenting on the bad service.  It does not seem that management is looking at these reviews as there are a couple of comments about the poor service.  

The food is wonderful!!! 

The service needs a lot of attention or an overhaul."}
{"text":"For a pizza place, they have the best burgers around! I love the service, and the food is phenomenal! One of my favorite places to go for dinner!"}
{"text":"Humble Pie should be \"humbled\" by their awful customer service. I just can't get over all the errors in customer service that we experienced during our visit. 

The location is super convenient and we were tied between the Mexican place in the plaza and this one. Upon entering, no one greeted us, customers were frustrated because there was no communication about wait times, or any type of wait list - it's a bit of a free for all. It took about 20 minutes to finally be seated, though the table we were seated at had been open the entire time we were standing there. The wait staff wander around back and forth and seem to accomplish very little, and seem to not have a clue who is doing what or what is even going on. 

Staff will outright walk past you if you ask for the bill, it is literally one step away from being self serve. We had to get up and go to the counter to grab our own napkins, none of the wait staff seemed to notice. We had to chase down wait staff for plates, and then utensils several times before we got them (food had already come to the table with nothing to eat it with). All I can say is hold your utensils close to you, because trying to get another set would be painful.

It appears there are several issues:
-the staff have no customer service skills
-no one seems to be \"leading\", it appears to be all junior employees
-the pizza cooks cannot keep up to a full house, they run about 20 pizzas behind and under cook the pizza to compensate
-the layout of the dining room is terrible.. tables in the middle of the floor instead of pushed to the side for a clear and open walkway. There is zero \"flow\"
-the previous mentioned lack of waiting system for customers

I would love to give this place better stars, but without the fixes for the issues I simply cannot. The food would be excellent if they would just properly cook the pizza. The dough is cooked, but barely. Even with light toppings, the dough underneath droops, the crust is doughy and not crusty and it is such a shame. Two out of our party asked for the pizzas to be left in twice as long and they came out just as underdone as the rest. 

The pizza toppings and cheese are fantastic, the pizza could be a 5/5 if the dough was cooked longer and there was great customer service. The fried ravioli was scrumptious and perfectly done - I would recommend this. The caesar salad was disappointing - it was kind of bland and far too many croutons , I would not recommend it for $8.50 (it's really only worth half that). The other salads have much more to them and seem to be a better value, but unfortunately I was craving caesar. 

The pizzas would be amazing if they were cooked longer. The Buffalo Chicken was delicious, the Margherita could have used more cheese, the Chicken Parmesan was yummy and the Humble Pie Signature Sausage was to die for (all minus the crust issues). 

The non-alcoholic beverage selection is lacking, so we stuck with waters. All and all from entering the restaurant to getting our bill the process took 1.5 hours.

I might consider another location if the reviews are better, but service is just too frustrating to deal with here and quite frankly restaurants are a dime a dozen."}
{"text":"After visiting another Humble Pie location (the one by OdySea Aquarium), I wasn't so sure I would ever step foot in a Humble Pie again. The experience between the locations is like day and night to be honest and I strongly recommend you visit this one instead of being disappointed. 

My husband and I really wanted toasted raviolis, and we had never done the whole Happy Hour thing at Humble Pie, so we figured why not. Although this is not our closest location, it was one of the best rated ones - so I had to check it out. 

The toasted raviolis were to die for, perfection honestly. I also splurged on an old time favorite, mozzarella sticks - I haven't ordered any in years.  If you love fried mozzarella, do these! They are perfect pillows of cheesy mozzarella goodness (they definitely satisfied my craving). 

We also decided to go for the pepperoni pizza and cheese on on the happy hour menu. I felt the pepperoni pizza was way better, and I usually prefer cheese pizza. I found the cheeses on the cheese pizza a little more oily (even after patting it down with a napkin). We had plenty of leftovers for another meal at home, and I found the cheese pizza was better reheated with some veggies on top. 

Service was quick and efficient and they know how to cook a pizza here, perfectly crisp!"}
{"text":"My jam! Favorite entrees include, the BLT, Mac n cheese, drumlettes, garlic fries. Not to mention most of these items are on their happy hour list. 

This is the only location I'll go to, considering it's the best. Their west valley location is awful, bland food, not good. 

The staff is always so friendly and just great. Love this place."}
{"text":"Ordered salad to go, was told 5-10 min. 25 min later had to go, no salad and manger refused to provide a refund... rip off!!"}
{"text":"Too bad I don't live nearby, this would make our list of regular haunts for sure.

Fantastic Caprese appetizer with fresh, so soft mozzarella, crostini, tomatoes (I would've preferred more) and a pesto/balsamic glaze, enough to sop up with the pizza crust (much better than licking the bowl, which you'll want to do!).

Light and crispy calamari made the hubby happy, and if course he snacked on my Caprese--WHY didn't we get the large?!

The Roasted Mushroom Pizza was deelish. Piled with various mushrooms and quality cheeses. The crust is just that: crusty but soft, just as I like it. I split it with a friend so as to save room for dessert...

A Pizza Cookie, Red Velvet Cake or Mini Donuts were the main choices but when I saw that they had chocolate ice cream (yay!), I had to go for the cookie with that on top. BJs is the only other place that does that! Hot cookie, very sweet with the chocolate and caramel drizzles. Just what I wanted.

The patio would've been very cramped and I'm sure that the service wouldn't have been as attentive if it hadn't been 3:00 in the afternoon but our threesome had a great linner (late lunch/early dinner) all the same."}
{"text":"A little pretentious.  Service was good.  Atmosphere and decor were nice. 

Caprice salad was good, calamari was a bit over cooked, sauce was excellent.  We ordered a pizza, pay a little more due to number of toppings, then pizza comes out with a small spattering of each topping :(

Don't charge me extra because there are more number of toppings, then skimp on amount of each!   In the end we only had a very small amount of toppings on our 12.95 / 11\" pizza with extra wide crust!  

Pizza was a FAIL for us!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is perfect. Love to share some appetizers and have a few cocktails, it's a great deal."}
{"text":"Meh ... That about sums it. 
Since we moved in the area, I wanted to try Humble Pie. I've heard people rave about it, and was really looking forward to it. So today was a perfect day to finally have late lunch there.

It is very small inside, but I like it. It looked nice, cozy and comfortable. They have inside/outside patio, cool thing. And I really liked the wine wall, besides it looking great, you can see what wine they offer (if you, unlike me, know anything about the wines). Anyhow, we choose to sit outside. You have only so many chances to enjoy patios in Phoenix, and I choose to use them all! Our server was Ashley and she was really great. Just enough friendly, to make us feel comfortable but not pushy or annoying. If it wasn't for her, I would give the place 2 stars. We came around 4pm and got in for Happy Hour. Cool that they have HH on Sundays. So I caved in and ordered Blue Margarita ($4). Usually I don't care if there is salt or not. Boy did I go wrong here, it was so salty that I had to wait for ice to melt and dilute a bit, otherwise it was undrinkable.

So far everything sounds great, right? And it was, but then food came out. I ordered Margherita. The crust was fresh and nice, but little bland. I could go easily over it, no big deal. It is kinda common knowledge that with Margherita, less is more. Tomato sauce was so strong and overpowering that I had to scrape it off. There were huge chunks of mozzarella, again, way too much. My bf had calamari and Caesar salad. Calamari were good, but the basil sauce they give with it just doesn't pair well. It is great tasting sauce for chicken, just not with calamari. Thankfully, Ashley was kind enough to give us some other spicy garlic red sauce that was delicious. Tried their home made Ranch, it was pretty good. Caesar salad was regular, you can't mess that up, can you. Well, if you put celery in, it just isn't it anymore?! Why celery in Caesar, beats me.

Overall, it is not negative experience, and I would go back if I'm with someone who wants to dine there. But it is very highly unlikely that I will initiate that ever again."}

Yelp Review 
6149 N Scottsdale Rd 
Scottsdale AZ 85250 - 2.2 miles 
(480) 556-9900

I have been coming to this Humble Pie for years and it does not disappoint. While this is not a five star, fancy restaurant, it is delicious food at a good price. My boyfriend and I like to come here for the express lunch menu, which is offered everyday from 11-3 where we order a 10 inch margherita pizza and small chop salad for just $9.95. It is the perfect amount of food at the perfect price. We also try to make it to \"Date Night Thursdays\" every Thursday after 6:00 where you get an appetizer to share, two small salads and a pizza to share for $24.95. The food is delicious and consistent. I am a die hard margherita pizza lover and theirs is my favorite in the valley. It is light, fresh, not too cheesy and has the perfect tomato and basil taste. All of their pizzas are wood-fired. I recommend asking for your pizza to be a little bit more charred than usual to make sure the crust is not too floppy. The chop salad, which has salami, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and romaine is also to die for and compliments the pizza perfectly. As far as appetizers go, the tempura fried green beans or toasted ravioli are my favorite. Aside from the margherita pizza, the organic local vegetable is also a must try! 

The ambience of Humble Pie is family-friendly with a comfortable, neighborhood feel. Kids eat free every Sunday and everyone is very friendly. The restaurant is very quaint; a small dining room, patio and bar that wraps around both the inside and outside. I've eaten here by myself, with my boyfriend and in a group of people and they're always very accommodating. 

While sometimes it can get busy, the service is overall pretty fast and accommodating. I think the key word here is fast. Lunch time is pretty busy because when they say \"Express Lunch\" they mean it. I have noticed that sometimes the restaurant can be a little understaffed, where at times this can cause a little bit longer of a wait for a table or to be greeted by a waiter or waitress but overall, I have never had a bad experience nor waited a ridiculous amount of time for a table or for any of my food. My family and I also enjoy ordering take-out. It is done in about 20 minutes and is just as good.

Overall, Humble Pie is a great place to eat for lunch or dinner, on a date, with family, or by yourself to grab a quick bite for lunch or happy hour. Therefore I give Humble Pie 4/5 stars for it's comfortable ambience, fast service and consistently delicious pizza and salad. The food is great but the service could be a tad bit better. For what you pay, you get good food, good service and it's nice having a place you can rely on."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking to go to a sushi place around the corner but since that restaurant turned out to be permanently closed, she told me that Humble Pie would be a good place grab some dinner. 

It took us about 10 minutes to get a table, as it was a Friday night and it was packed. We didn't know what we wanted to eat right away (obviously I didn't as I don't even live in AZ) so our waitress left us and came back. We ordered bruschetta for an appetitizer, 2 tomato, mozzarella, basil, balsamic reduction & 2 roasted red peppers, goat cheese, tomato jam. Both were very good and I would definitely order them again. 

I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza for dinner (smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green, & bbq sauce) without green onions and it was AMAZING (perhaps because I was starving after hiking Camelback that morning). Great crust and a generously sized pizza, I ate the rest of it for lunch the following day.

We split a 6\" cookie pizza and it was good, not the best of that dish I've ever had but it's hard to go too wrong with a hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. 

The one thing about eating here that kinda put me off was our waitress. She wasn't very attentive but this may have been because they were busy. We had to wait over 10 minutes from when finished dinner before we could order dessert."}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal over happy hour. The fried ravioli and Margherita pizza were both delicious. The prices cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni pizza.  Cheese kept falling off the crust when eating and the quality was mediocre.  Decent for airport food but wouldnt go there if I had more options."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here a couple of times a month. I have never been blown away by a glass of wine here, but they have affordable options that aren't bad. I have tried at least half of the pizzas on their menu. Get what sounds good to you, but their sour dough crust in a fire oven is phenomenal. I haven't tried too many of the other options on their entree menu. Happy Hour is an even better choice for affordability, and it runs until 6. I love the green bean tempura appetizer best, but the others are delicious as well depending on what you are in the mood for. I definitely recommend. Kaitlen is the best, and I love the manager here, David - always friendly and smiling."}

{"text":"Excellent pizza and great beer on tap! Nice atmosphere too, although the tv's are annoying because its not a sports bar and should try to be!
After goof back a few times, we've realized the customer service is bad half the time, particularly when getting accommodated with a baby or toddler. We were asked to wait such a long time, that we just have to head back home."}
{"text":"You ever meet someone and just know they are important? That's Ryan Pfile a server at the Tatum and 101 Humble Pie. He is the best in the biz. Our pizza was perfectly cooked and the calamari was amazing. But it was the service that truly made us become regulars here. Ryan is humble and sweet. I really love coming here."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, it was great.  The food came out in 10 minutes, as we were previously warned when we put our names down for a seat.  I tried the humble pie sausage pizza and the sourdough cheeseburger and both were rich and tasty.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointing,  2 breakfast burritos 2 coffees,  $27.00.  Not edible,  Never again.  Am normally very impressed with Sky Harbors restaurants.   Not Humble Pies breakfasts...yuck."}
{"text":"Food is okay, I only ate here as I was hungry and got to watch the Blackhawks win to tie series at 3-3! 

Food is pricey at so so quality! Had burger that was very dry and has NY cheesecake that was blah!! 

Gave this a 3 star because they at least it employ's people, or else I would have given this place a 2!"}
{"text":"Second try for this 'humble' pie place. They should be humble. The staff seem confused and ore occupied with I dont know what. 
So waited excessively both times. Took a long long time for seating and service. And it was only Third full.
Then the food arrived after another anxious 45 minutes. 
The pizza was limp and soggy. And really not that tasty.  The salad was dry. The appetizers were cold. 
We came for a birthday celebration and everyone felt slighted(there was 8 of us)
Fortunately the beers and drinks came fast and plenty. But really folks, you should get it together. 
None of us will be returning. Enter with caution.  2 stars for drinks only."}
{"text":"Humility is only a thing worth mentioning when you have a recognizable skill to be humble about. That is not the case here and therefore I suggest they change there name to \"the entirely accurate self perspective resulting in low self esteem pie.\"

The breakdown! 

Service was good fast a friendly. 
(That's why they got 2 and not one star)

For $8 I got what they called a breakfast wrap which is nothing more than a bad breakfast burrito. Maybe Mexico sued them, \"a ese, this is no burrito, this is caca.\" Who knows, but I was greasy, gross, and the sausage taste like dog treats.  

And yes I have sampled dog treats, but that's a story for another day."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! Me and a friend were walking around the Phoenix Art Museum when we decided to get a bite to eat and thanks to the wonders of Yelp came across this gem :). Humble pie is just a short drive from the museum and offers a variety of items such as pizza and pasta. To our pleasant surprise we arrived in time for happy hour which runs from 3-6. We opted to order the wings, pretzel with cheese dip, cheesy bread, and fries. To our surprise the portions were huge! The cheesy bread alone was the size of a flatbread pizza! Overall, good experience and would definitely be back for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about Humble Pie! The food, drinks, staff are all incredible! My wife and I visit here regularly (not always checking in on Yelp) but love it!"}
{"text":"If you're into waiting an hour for a slice of pizza, then this spot is your jam! Perhaps they should hire a staff that isn't serving tables for their first job!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many critical reviews.  This is not a James Beard foodie hotspot with a typical 6 month shelf life.  This is a great little local place you can count on to bring friends, have a date night or bring the family. 

My husband, kids and I have come to this location several times since we moved to the neighborhood and have been happy with the service and the food each time.  Are they flawless? No. But when something's not right, they make it right and with a great attitude.  

We love a good Scottsdale or Arcadia restaurant every now & then too but the service is always spotty. We are so grateful to be able to level set by coming back to our fresh, friendly little Humble Pie in a town full of chain disasters!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 
Convenience: 5/5 
Price: 3/5

Of course, the price of any item in any airport is going to be inflated. So, that being said when you only have two restaurants to chose from (in our terminal anyway) this little place will get the job done. 

Ex: breakfast for 3 people with drinks... $75. 

And no, this isn't a bottomless mimosa brunch buffet. 
But there's a concept! Just skip the food altogether and stick to the bar. Better deals that way anyway ;)

Happy travels!"}
{"text":"presentation not what we expected for a caprese salad. the amount that we got for $10 was not what we expected. also the mozerella looked like cottage cheese. haha"}
{"text":"Headed out to this location over the weekend and this was our first time visiting this particular chain as well.  We made a reservation online since it was a holiday weekend, but didn't end up needing it since there seemed to be enough seats.  However, if we had chosen a later time than we did - we most definitely would have needed that reservation since the place filled up within the following hour.

We made it in time for happy hour so I chose the pomegranate martini and he had a rum and coke.  Both drinks were made well.  For food he chose to get the turkey chili bowl (small cup appetizer) and lasagna (main meal).  I had the spaghetti with 3-meat meatballs.  See pictures for reference!

The lasagna was a touch on the bland side - but that may have only been because we had the turkey chili first and that definitely had some kick to it!  The spaghetti and meatballs were delicious and I love the 3-meat meatballs that came with it.  The amount of the serving seemed smaller at first, but as I dug into the meal I struggled to finish everything on the plate.

We also ordered the pizza cookie at the end, which was tasty, but we may pass on it next time since it had an odd flavor he wasn't too keen on.  

Overall: A
The waiter was very friendly and efficient despite the busy nature of the weekend, food was tasty (though we may opt out on the lasagna next time for another option) and the outdoor seating was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is great. The Pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best Pizza Ive ever had. Salads are good and and service is excellent.

{"text":"I came for lunch a few days and wanted to take advantage of the express lunch menu. They were understaffed with only two waitresses and there were lots of customers. The waitress came by to drop off water and took our order. 45 minutes came by and no food and no waitress. The guests that sat right next to us sat the same time as us and they had food and were almost done eating. The waitress finally shows up and drops off our check. Um, we look at her weird and say \"thanks for the check but we never got our food!!\" Needless to say the express lunch wasn't \"express\". We had to go back to the office so we had them box up our food so we can eat our lunch at our desk. The only reason why I give them two stars as opposed to one is that they comped our food, but the waitress didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we found this place.  It was pouring rain so we opted to dine in.  There's a large patio available for dining outside during better weather.  After we browsed the menu, we ordered:

The server didn't take notes during the order and didn't remember to put in that I wanted the Wedge Salad to come out with the Bruschetta.  So what happens?  They bring it out with the Pizza.  When I mentioned it to the runner, she said \"It wasn't input that way\" and walked off...no apology, ok.  I don't know why servers don't take notes...whenever a server stands there and tries to memorize our order, I know it will end up screwed up 80% of the time....they'll forget a detail or two.  Write it down and get it right!

So the service here is less than stellar.  Good thing the food is good.  The Proscuitto, Figs, and Mascarpone Cheese Bruschetta is awesome...full of flavor.  The Roasted Pepper Bruschetta is a little bland though, so I'd pass on that next time.

The Wedge Salad is very good and the portion size is perfect for a starter dish....I don't know why that server thought I wanted it as an entree...I don't look like a small Salad entree type guy.  

The Pizza is pretty good....above average.  The ingredients are fresh and the Crust is cooked just right when we ordered well done.

Overall, this place has 3.5 to 4 Stars for the food.  2 Stars for the service.  Will have to come back and see if it improves.

{"text":"When I was a kid, pizza was magic!  As an adult, thanks to the many national pizza chains, and the advent of $5 Hot n Ready..it's lost it's sparkle.  I rarely ever pick a pizza destination anymore, unless I'm needing to get my kids on board. But yesterday, I tried Humble Pie for the 1st time..and it took me back to when Pizza was new.  AWESOME!!!
I should mention, they told me about the $2.50 Happy Hour Kiltlifters right away, so I was in love before I even placed my Pizza order. 
I had the Roasted Potato & Garlic pizza, and I'm still dreaming about it. There were places where the crust was burnt black..and even that was great..how do you do that??  I can't imagine going there and trying anything else..I'm the type of guy who finds one amazing dish and sticks with it. But my wife had the BBQ chicken and was equally impressed.  
My advice...if you haven't been to Humble Pie...go there."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, friendly service, satisfyingly spicy drumettes and fresh margherita pizza.  I was lucky to stumble into this place after my MIM visit."}
{"text":"Boy has this place gone down hill!! Walked in on a Friday night and it was a ghost town. Sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers with my wife. Kids were at grandma & grandpas, so we were excited to enjoy a quiet dinner. We ordered the meat & cheese board and the bruschetta. Presentation looked nice. The fig & mascarpone was good, red pepper was good, apple was so so, and tomato mozzarella was so so. Meat and cheese board was terrible. The meat & cheese board was a total let down. The olives tasted like they had been sitting in the refrigerator for a week and absorbed all the other smells from the old food. The cheese selection was a mound of rough cut parmesan and some other flavorless hard cheese. Absolutely no thought went into this. The only positive was the beer was cold.

On a side note, the couple sitting next to us also sent back their pizza because the sausage tasted bad. 

I hope they make some drastic changes or we will not be back."}
{"text":"We've been going here since the restaurant opened and have slowly seen its decline. Many experiences with slow, inattentive service and food quality is not up to par. In the last month we have had two poor dinners. Each time service is slow with not many tables full, servers no where to be found and dirty tables left near us the whole dining time. Tonight was the last straw. When we mentioned our unhappiness to our server he said \"blame it Uber Eats.\" We try it eat local to support the community but will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Dude, I've been here multiple times, great pizzas and OK service, but seriously the waitress we had the other day had a HUGE chip on her shoulder, she was just in a terrible mood and SHOWED IT. Come on Humble Pie, you guys are better than this!!"}
{"text":"Humble Pie didn't quite hit my expectations for a gourmet pizza place, unfortunately nothing too rousing. We had the calamari and the pesto sauce that went with that made for a nice accent. The wild mushroom pizza had a fine earthiness, but it was more crust than toppings, short on sauce -- for $14 small pizza, they shouldn't scrimp on what gives the pie flavor. They did have a decent wine by the glass selection, and I had a velvety Pinot. Staff was young and eager, speedy service, but I found the overall ambience a bit sterile."}
{"text":"It's pizza behind security...the formula pizza on fair crust, with, as most airport pizzas, not enough sauce, cheese or toppings, but plenty of \"fair\" crust.

Their pizzas are all \"personal\"...with formula recipes you request by name.  The dough is stretched, the toppings applied, the pizza put in an oven and baked.  After, it is cut, put in a box and handed to the purchaser.  7-8 minutes unless they are really busy...then 10 minutes or so.

On participating in the 'airport employee opening', the day before the concourse opening of the restaurants, I observed a disjointed system that created lots of pizzas.  I requested a custom pizza, adding pepperoni to a formula recipe pizza; after 20 minutes and a description of the first pizza coming out of the oven with a hole in the middle...I gave up and accepted the formula recipe pizza without the addition of pepperoni.  The quality of the product...not exactly...but certainly a nice free result of the effort.  

2 days after the concourse opening, I stopped to order pizza again and requested the formula recipe with pepperoni added.  The pizza and the addition...certainly a pricey opportunity.  The location was not very busy...2 people before me were awaiting delivery, then me and 3 people after by the time I received my pizza.  10 minutes after I placed my order, I asked the guy behind the counter regarding timing.  He advised he saw my order in the computer.  

I waited 5 minutes more, and asked again.  The guy behind the counter checked with the pizza creators.  They advised they may have put too much pepperoni on the pizza, and it required a few extra minutes to cook completely.  2 more minutes and the pizza was in a box, delivered to me.  

Opening the box gave me pizza with 1 1/2 inch crust...the tastes are good...just want a few more bites of substance than what you offer.  Crust is fresh...just lacking in flavor.  In my travels, I find the crust depends on the water used.  If it is Phoenix water, the minerals are wrong...and the taste is affected.  

For the price, it is adequate.  The tough part on my side is finding the availability to pay $11 for a personal pizza.  In the worst world, I can order Dominos or Pizza Hut before I fly and carry it through security.  If the item presented were beyond what I could get on the street, I could see the jacked up pricing.  For me, once, maybe twice a year I could justify spending money here."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on my way out of town. Bloody Mary was awesome - the bartender Sean was great! The bacon was incredible. Prices are a little steep however, it's the airport..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. I loved the music and neighborhood. Parking can be a little tight. I got the pepperoni with bacon and cheesy bread. The kids loved the cheesy bread. The pizza was fantastic. The white sangria was on happy hour with the cheesy bread. The white sangria was sweet but refeeshing. Loved it!"}
{"text":"we usually get take out and order just pizza so on our last visit we dined in and saw there were way more options then just pizza... i tried the mac & cheese and it was delicious.... very hot as i burnt my tongue but very yummy. the pizza is also delicious and we got there just before closing so they were nice to let us eat there and told us not to rush as they were cleaning the inside since most people left. the waiter was very nice and helpful with everything. will definitely have to come more often and dine in"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times and always order pizza.  We have always enjoyed their menu options and this time around we ordered the mozzarella balls which was really good.  They have friendly & fast service great beer selection on tap.  We were happy campers with our pizza order - went with the basic pepperoni had lots of cheese and the sauce was great.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding, the Calimari is great and the Fig and prosciutto pizza is amazing.

We received a coupon for this place so I brought some friends and the family and it was a pretty good experience. It was Friday night, so the wait was a little horrendous but once we got seated the service was pretty good overall. Some kinks are being worked out since they opened just recently but nothing unforgivable.

We were brought an incorrect order, and the staff comped it and brought out a replacement without hesitation. This impressed me.

They have a really good special on Sundays if you have kids, two kids eat free for every one adult all day on Sunday.

I have to say though that the prices are pretty high though so know what you're in for before you go if you can check out their menu on the web.

Also, if I had any suggestions for them I'd say install some lights on the patio so people can be seated out there at night, and install some benches out front so people can sit while they wait (currently there is no waiting area indoors and nowhere to sit, this is pretty rough if you've got children)

It may sound like I have a lot to complain about but really the positive outweighed the negative in a big way so I am giving this place 4 stars. If you've been to other high-end pizza places and have been gloriously underwhelmed (Biancos) then Upper Crust is a place you are going to like."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE  this place. I would go often but after what happened to me this past Friday I won't be returning.  Two friends and I went over after work and sat down. We waited and waited for someone to greet us. There was only 1 other table    with customers. The young waiter with the long puffy hair and backwards red hat came over and chatted with them several times, looked over at us and kept walking.

  We gave him benefit of doubt thinking he was serving the other table. Even the young lady at the other was shocked he wasn't asknowledging us, making a comment like \" I know he saw them\" to her friend. 

We are working professionals in the area, not a group of hobos sitting there. After close to 30 minutes the other lady got up to get the waiter after he ignored us waving him over. We were so beyond insulted we left and went next door to The Main Ingredient which was soooooo much better. OMG talk about fresh delicious food. 

Sorry Humble Pie, your racist/sexist, rude, ignorant horrible whatever waiter killed it for us. We will be sure to let everyone know about this experience. We will be moving our group over to The Main Ingredient."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and came to check this place out because they sent over a flyer. We walked in and were sat within 3 minutes. The food and drinks looked great! We were excited because there was still 15 min left of happy hour. Little did I know that we would sit for the next 15 minutes at our table without anyone coming by. I tried to grab someone's attention but every time they just dodged me. We walked out and headed next door. If your busy it's understandable but at least bring by a water and greet the table. It's very rude and unprofessional to let a table sit for 15 min without acknowledging them. The Main Ingredient next door has been a much better experience."}
{"text":"Truth be told, great happy hour. Very strong drinks, we all know I'm a fan of that :) I just had to try the Lemoncello Margarita, I mean come on...awesome idea! I loved it.

It was hard to find parking close to the place though. Something nearby must be REALLY popular, because it was packed. I was nervous there wouldn't be enough room for my group, but surprisingly there was...plenty.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Lemoncello Margarita, and the Tempura Green Beans!"}
{"text":"There are two reasons that I go to Humble Pie on a regular basis; 1. the local crowd and 2. The amazing staff, especially the bartenders. The food is not high on the list. It is okay, but nothing I would go out of my way for, typical. This place earns all of its stars on staff alone. Happy Hour prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Just picked up a light breakfast  and snacks here and was truly agitated by the service. This is an airport. People are usually in a rush and some have their hands full. After ordering and paying for my food (several items not easy carried) it was just left on the counter. I asked the guy at the register for a bag (very nicely) and instead of placing my order in a bag, like normal people in his position do, he throws the bag on top and starts taking the next persons order. My hands were full. So instead of speeding up his line he just slowed it down as he waited for me to bag my stuff. I come through here on a frequent basis - I won't stop by Humble Pie again. It's in Terminal A. 

I walked past it later and noticed other travelers fumbling with their purchases as they got out of line because he simply could not put people's stuff in a bag. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is really phenomenal! I came here with the Groupon special 20$ worth of food for $11. Reaching $20 was easy since the pizza (only one size) was $15. That's a bit pricey but the quality is there. I also ordered the deep fried ravioli as an appetizer and it was a bit of a disappointment. They were overly greasy and the marinara sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce you'd dip your grill cheese in. The service here is great, bathrooms are clean, and outdoor seating is great when it gets busy. All in all, I'd only return here if I have that Groupon, otherwise it's a bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This Humble Pie location is amazing!

It's cozy inside and has a fun, warm atmosphere. The staff are attentive and just all around good people. Every time I've been in, the staff are friendly and give great service! It can be a busy spot, and they do a great job multitasking with a smile! 

The food is incredible! The pizzas are made in the wood oven, so have a great flavor (can sometimes come out with darker/ more cooked spots, but that is what happens in a wood oven and adds to the authenticity)! My favorite salad of all time is their chopped salad - the lemon vinegarette is fresh and the salad is hearty and delicious! Oh, and the tempura green beans are amazing! 

All in all, this location is a Phoenix gem offering great food, great ambaiance, and great people! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The place was packed and unfortunately I decided to sit at the bar. The \"big\" bartender seemed annoyed with us and even told me not to ask him for a drink unless he was looking directly at me. He was very rude and I would not recommend anyone to go to this place after that experience."}
{"text":"For the second time, I've had an online order cancelled by this location. If you can't handle a delivery order at 2pm on a Saturday and 7pm on a Wednesday, don't sign up to take them at all. We love the food, and have also dined in once a month or more, but that was the last time."}
{"text":"If you're headed there for  the lunch hour, you probably should put your \"out of office\" on your email because you'll be there for at least the next two hours. 

Alas, when I saw that there was a lunch special (about $10 for a half salad and pizza), I figured it would be a relatively typical lunch hour. Usually places that have lunch specials abide by the 1-hour lunch rule, but definitely not this place--at least, not in this instance. Holy moly, I had no idea that it took so long to make salad and pizza at Humble Pie. I am a regular at Sauce Pizza + Wine, and it usually takes them about 3 minutes to bring my salad after ordering, then another 5 minutes to have my pizza out. I think we were about 45 minutes into being at Humble Pie when our salads were brought out. I think my coworker was about ready to eat his shirt at that point.

Alright, so how good was this hyped up place? Well...it was ok. First, I was a little surprised that the restaurant was small and the tables were kind of cramped, but I guess that adds to the ambiance of being a humble place. I ordered the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was OK, but not very flavorful. It kind of tasted like a salad I'd make at home. My pizza was a standard pepperoni, to which I added on olives. The pepperoni is the smaller diameter style pepperoni found at some other specialty pizza joints like Grimaldi's. It was uber salty and greasy, which felt very sinful as I was eating it. I think there was enough pepperoni on the pizza to cover 2 or 3 pizzas, actually. The crust, cheese and sauce were good, however. I suppose I should have ordered a veggie pizza or something a little less meaty to enjoy my meal.

Overall, the food was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary special that I'd die to take my friends to. At least the service is pretty good (aside from the kitchen being super low), so I suppose I'd be OK with going back and giving it another shot...on a weekend."}
{"text":"Nice setting, service was just okay as well as the pizza.  The folks there were a bit too eclectic for our taste.  Beers were the same as everywhere else so that didn't make it stand out either.  We would go there again but would not go out of our way to go there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pizzas are really great. My favorite is the sausage and fennel. Good service and really friendly bartenders.  Really cool open air atmosphere.   Parking can be a struggle but once you are inside you are good."}
{"text":"Kaitlin was very personable and charming wait was longer but she was awesome, the wait was longer then I wanted to  wait but once we sat down the good only tool 10 mins to get and the sourdough cheese burger was awesome"}
{"text":"Huge rip off. Small draft is 9:00, small bottle of bud is $7.50. Any pizza other than cheese is $5.00 more. Example pepperoni personal pizza is $16.49, mind you this is an 8 inch pizza. Airport food with ballgame prices. Skip it and head next door to four peaks."}
{"text":"Showed up and they were out of pizza dough. Such poor planning. No thank you. I'd rather eat at a pizzeria that can actually make pizza.

Whyyyy, Humble Pie? You're usually so good, but I can't just show up for your draft beer alone. I need pizza."}
{"text":"Much nicer servers... Good quality has improved as well enjoying the new changes... They even have a great lunch special that they discounted recently! We have been back 3 times and I felt the need to update the review reflecting positive changes. Thanks"}
{"text":"Update!

Sometimes you do get a second chance to make a first impression.  I recently returned to Humble Pie for another try.  I am happy to say that the service was MUCH better than my previously reviewed visit (yay!).  

I had the shrimp pizza, and my friend enjoyed the chicken with pesto pizza.  Both were prepared perfectly, with thin crust that tastes slightly of sourdough.  Our waiter was cheerful and attentive, and kept those water & wine glasses filled.   

Since this location is so convenient for me, I am happy that I had a better experience this time.  Of course, it didn't hurt that it was a Monday, where all bottles of wine are 1/2 off - woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware. $8.69 for a frozen soft pretzel. Just like the one from the grocery store. Returned"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely nice. They were quick to seat us, Took our drink order and then let us check out the cool menu. They don't only have pizza, they have pasta, salads, sandwiches and hamburgers. They have a kids menu and high chairs. So don't be afraid to bring the family."}
{"text":"I ordered the organic veggie pizza and strawberry salad during the \"express lunch\" menu today.  I was very pleased with the outdoor seating, the menu selection, the quality friendly service, and the amazing food.  It was delicious!  It was my first time there and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"After checking out pizza options in the area, we decided to try this place due to the great reviews. 
Why only 4 stars? Because I want a larger pizza for the price! It was that good!
We went with a specialty pizza that had a great crust and was perfectly cooked.
The toppings were average in how many were on the pizza but the flavor was wonderful and we added their sausage which is a must try.
The interior is nothing to write home about.
The menu could provide more options as well and the server could warm up a bit. 
Perhaps he wasn't thrilled with having to work on the holiday?
 I want more!"}
{"text":"Yelpers giving this place four or five stars are either seriously misguided, don't have refined pallets, or simply haven't tried Bianco or Cibo.  This place was over priced, had fairly poor service, and the pizza just wasn't that good.

I ordered the sausage pizza.  The sausage was pretty bland.  They also screwed up my order by adding onions when I didn't ask for them.  I've had my order messed up on pizzas before by having toppings left off, but never added on that I simply didn't order.  Found that strange.  I would have sent it back, but the waiter didn't check to see how everything was until about fifteen minutes after the food was brought to the table.

I'd give Humbe Pie 1.5 stars if I could, but rounded up since it is better than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  I went after buying the GroupOn coupon, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was going to let it pass and not write anything until I got up motivation to give them another chance but after the couple of amazing afterglow reviews I had to write to give warning: \"Your experience may differ. \"  We arrived after 9 and despite their closing at 10, if not exactly feeling of leisure, there was not one of being rushed, though we had a feeling the kitchen was.  Food, 2 pizzas, arrived promptly, one good, the goat cheese pizza, though have had better for less elsewhere, the other with prosciutto, \"extra crispy\".  Blackened burnt crust utterly devoid of any trace of moisture - dry dry dry.  Hard & brittle. 

Liked the general ambiance though rather dark to read the menus and the noise level was rather high.  Service was decent and fast.  After having just recently made first visit to the Parlor however, it was a poor showing by comparison as far as taste & price.  \"Gourmet\" indeed.   

Based on this one single visit, to paraphrase a quote mis-attributed to Winston Churchill, Humble Pie has much to be humble about.  I'll give them another chance, but probably not until there's another Groupon or Monsoon Deal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Humble Pie last evening! We had pizza on our first wedding anniversary and celebrated with pizza again for our 27th! Loved the bruschetta and the goat cheese pizza was amazing. The beer was nice and cold. Service was spot on. Highly recommend enjoying a meal here!"}
{"text":"I'll say more like 2 and a half stars.

Not bad, Not Great. No WOW's here, at least not for me.

We ordered a Cesar salad, good, but it was not even cold. (see pics)

Wild Mushroom pizza with pancetta, green onions and ,mozzarella (see pics)  
Boring , really lacking in any flavor at all. I was pretty bummed about that, Even though  I did like the texture and crispy pillowy-ness of the crust, it was very bland too. And I'm pretty sure that was just plain ol' bacon.

Pepperoni Pizza (see pics) The Mr. Liked it, I'm not really a fan of pepperoni and I really didn't care for the flavor of this one especially.

Pizza Cookie (see pics) Pretty big, but very thin, skimpy on the chocolate and caramel sauce and no whip cream. 

I've had better, will be my closing words for my entire experience here."}
{"text":"Waiting for a flight and decided to grab some pizza, yes at 7am. However, when I went up to the counter, the lady was very rude. She did not make any eye contact and made it very clear she didn't want to be there. I asked for a pepperoni pizza and she said they are not serving it right now. So I ordered a breakfast wrap and went along my business. Then I looked up at the menu again and under pizzas it said, 'Served ALL day!'. I am a frequent flyer and I will not be coming back to this establishment, if this is the way I am treated and lied to."}
{"text":"Looking for a pizza fix and this place fit the bill. Our waiter was awesome. Pizza was just how we liked it. We got a margherita and pepperoni pizza. Quick and even though near closing time, I did not feel rushed. He even offered to fire a new pizza from the kitchen if we wanted more. Would come back."}
{"text":"Best gluten-free pizza. Just wish there was no added charge for this health-related food item."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Humble Pie on our way to another well known pizza venue up the street. This was the most delicious pizza since Osteria Coppa in San Mateo. Pick up a slice and it is not \"floppy\"...rather crispy on the bottom with a slightly chewy crust...perfect. Loved the pistachio and leek. The guy had pepperoni and mushroom. Great service and the pies came out quickly.Would go back for sure"}
{"text":"My expectation: airport pizza that rivals Pizza Hut at best... My reality: an enjoyable setting with a friendly staff that served a pretty decent pizza! The crust was a crisp and delicious, made-in-house treat, the mozzarella was all fresh, the pepperoni not too spicy, the sauce not too sweet, all combing into a delicious pizza. Drinks refilled without request, check delivered and paid quickly... Couldn't ask for much more at an airport restaurant. 


Humble Pie is located in the Southwest terminals."}
{"text":"Because my otherwise perfect and adorable SO has a weakness for any and all food topped with a half-cooked runny egg, I have been dragged against my will to HP more than a few times. Yes, a runny egg and prosciutto \"breakfast\" pizza. This is the ultimate bastardization of a pizza, in my \"humble\" opinion, but he adores it.

I have been pretty meh about it all along. The location really blows us for us CenPho folk. The pizza has the dreaded erectile dysfunction-style flaccid crust. People! This is so wrong. I love the earthy goodness of a wood fired pizza, but why is it physically impossible to firm those puppies up? 

I have had some mixed veggie salad that was completely forgettable, and their mozzarella and tomatoes-on-a-vine salad, which is actually pretty tasty (albeit small for the price), drizzled in thick balsamic vinegar. HP finally won me over last night when I had the brilliant idea of ordering the pizza well done. Was it the crackery crispness I craved? Well, no, but it certainly helped, and my usual day-after pizza routine (heat on a dry hot skillet till cheese is melty) crisped it right up to almost Parlor quality. Cool! I've found a way for my gooey-yolk-loving sweetheart and I to happily coexist at a pizza place -- thus far an impossibility. Cheaper than couples counseling and a lot more fun. OK. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Okay. Yesterday was supposedly the hottest day in Phoenix in years. Simply walking outside invokes the sensation of the flesh burning off one's limbs. The weather reporter melted a bag of marshmallows and some butter by leaving it on the dash of his car and made no-bake Rice Krispie treats. The sweat burns your eyes and sedates your soul into depressive submission. This weather is gnarly and is not for the faint of heart.

So WHY. IN. THE. FUCK. would Humble Pie leave its bar open? Like, windows down, communicating with the patio open? No, wait. I get it. Some sickos were actually eating on the patio. It's part of the \"vibe\". So perhaps my question should be, WHY IN THE FUCK WOULD YOU NOT CRANK DOWN YOUR A/C? My dad's MacGyver watch helpfully relayed that the ambient temperature was 88 degrees. They already have people packed so close like sardines in there, you can practically feel the next table's body heat -- add this level of heat and noise and I thought one of us was going to pass out. No effing bueno. Sweatshop atmosphere duly noted and we will not be back till October.

P.S. The bathroom is always filthy and the craft shop potpourri is ghetto.

P.P.S. I do adore the cucumber vodka + club soda cocktail, but it's called a \"Skinny Size Zero\" which ensures I feel like an anorexic cougar when I order it. I see you smirking, you 23-year-old bastard of a server."}
{"text":"Service was great (thanks Rizzo) and was very impressed with food. Overall, liked the vibe, service and decor. Will return often."}
{"text":"I live very close to the Desert Ridge location but this is my favorite Humble Pie. You're not sitting right on top of anyone else and noise level is good. Service is always very friendly and attentive. Pizza is good. Have tried lots of different options and will be back for more. Nice job - thanks!"}
{"text":"We have been to Humble Pie several times and have always had a really nice experience. Their selection of pies is great and we love their specials for lunch! Out of the 5 times or so that we've been there we've only experienced \"meh\" service once. The other times service was fine. We will continue to frequent Humble Pie on Happy Valley."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Humble Pie!  The staff is excellent and super friendly, and the food is quite yummy!  My commercial kitchen for my own business is next door so I go there quite often for lunch.  My favorites are the Caprese (both the salad and the sandwich), those AMAZING seasoned french fries, and let's not forget about the fantastic wood fired pizzas!  They have a great lunch special and a fun Date Night on Thursdays.  
If you want good food and a great experience, then you must try Humble Pie!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good.  why the two stars then?  Well.....they have a baked mac & cheese on their menu that looks super yummy.  So, when we went here w/our kid and saw it, we thought, \"Maybe they have it on the kid's menu.\"  To our delight, it was there.

Then, when our child's dinner came out, to our HORROR, it was KRAFT MAC & CHEEZE.  Yes, people, it was that orange pasta...dry and not creamy at all.  My kid was hungry and our food hadn't come out yet, so we didn't send it back, but mostly, I think I was honestly in shock for the next few hours about the whole situation.  Thank goodness he didn't eat much of it anyway (because it sucks!).  Red Robin has better mac & cheese for kids and that's not saying much.

Hello Humble Pie...KIDS ARE PEOPLE TOO.  Why not serve the good stuff to little ones???  At the least, if you are going to continue to serve shitty food to kids, please make that clear on your kid's menu so we adults can make informed decisions....i.e., \"this is the crap...er...kraft mac and cheese, not the good stuff we serve to adults.\"  Thank you."}
{"text":"Great little place if you are looking for a casual bite. The roasted brussel sprouts were yummy, as well as the dinners: chopped salad and marinated tomato and arugula pizza. The lasagna was okay, not great. Good, but slow service, decent wine list. Seems like pizza is definitely the way to go here."}
{"text":"Mike is a great server. Drinks are on time and the food is great. But I beat Martin at golf :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after hiking Thunderbird mountain.  They have a $8 lunch, sandwich and salad ... food was very good and healthy. And a terrific price"}
{"text":"Lunch special = decent size individual pizza with a very small salad.  Drink was $3 extra for a total of $14....I don't think so.  Service was pretty good, not great.  $14 is too much for what they're offering."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! My husband and I got express lunch (10\" pizza and a 1/2 salad) I got the meatball pizza and the Caesar salad. My husband got the meat lovers pizza and a mixed green salad. The croutons were a little stale but other then that everything was delicious! The pizza was very good, the sauce was perfect a little bit sweet but not too much and the crust was perfectly crispy! I would personally opt for the meatball pizza over the meat lovers but all the meats were really good. Our server was very nice and very attentive. Our drinks never even got close to being empty! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I got my food after everyone else at my table. As in, they had already started clearing everyone else's plates. 

The pizza was OK. I've had better at CPK and Oregano's. 

We ordered J√§ger bombs and they were out of red bull. 

The pizza cookie was not as good as some of the other restaurants of their likeliness."}
{"text":"Cute near downtown version of the Scottsdale sister restaurant.  Stopped on a whim with my spouse during heavy lunch hour traffic and we sat at the bar and received great service.  Good wine specials in the early hours and there wasn't a scrap of food on our plates when we left.  I had the BLT and spouse had the soup de jour.  Will definitely return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"They did some serious downsizing on portions! I'm being serious and not being mean. Nothing was altered by me, this is exactly what was presented. I did ask if they downsized and was told no! The salad could be eaten in two bites! I didn't recognize the manager! I won't return!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend today and it was one of the best lunches I've had in a while! The staff was friendly and the food was great. Love the xpress lunch, you get to choose a sald (the chopped salad is amazing) and you get a personalized pizza from which you can choose any type. When I got my pizza they had made a slight mistake in toppings but I could tell they really cared that a mistake was made and offered to fix it for me right away even though I decided to just keep it. But again you could tell they wanted to make sure I had an excellent dining experience. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Damn pizza at airport this better than pizza you can get it home I highly suggest a great beer music kind of kickback so good you might want to take a box of pizza home with you enjoy Kaitlyn is the best!"}
{"text":"It was nice to get back to this old favorite. it's been a few months but Im always happy to stop in.
I think the place has lost its personal touch it once garrnered, and service has never been it's stong point, but It's the great food that comes out of the kitchen that I love so much. Tried somthing new tonight, it was the meat lovers pizza (odd name) but it sure was tasty! and I have never been without the chopped salad, possibly the very best salad in town.
We were in a rush and got in and out in about 50 minutes. Thats pretty good for dinner on a friday night."}
{"text":"The only reason they are getting one star is the service person was very good at her job. 
I should've used the app instead of my nose! The last time I was here I had a burrito at the Mexican food shop next door and it was atrocious, so today I went to Humble Pie for a breakfast wrap. $10.99 for a bacon egg and cheese wrap with a half cup of cubed potatoes, red & green bell peppers on the side and cup of fruit that looked like it should've been thrown out the day before yesterday.  I'm not sure what it is with this airport, but they can't get the food thing right! 
Had I used the Yelp app, I would've made another choice, like peanuts on the flight!"}
{"text":"I only stopped in today for coffee and it's only their third day open. They were slammed and did a good job trying to help me even though their takeout window isn't opened yet. The one lets looked amazing as I watched them go by. I wish I wasn't so crazy about getting I my flight be because I would stopped and had one they looked so good!"}
{"text":"This place is lucky their food is great because the service is so bad they are fortunate to have any patrons at all.  We have been to this Humble Pie location several times and the food is so good you will start craving it and have to have it.  Some of the items we have tried:  SOP pizza, artichoke pizza, olive pizza, meat lovers pizza, roasted mushroom pizza,Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage, tuna melt, chopped salad, strawberry gorgonzola salad, pizza cookie.   Everything has always been great.   Now the bad part:   the service.   It takes forever to get waited on.  The tables are not bussed in a timely manner.   Dirty tables in the dining room are the norm.   The food sits up at the line with no runner to deliver it to your table.  The female bartender just stands around, doesn't help seat people or run food.  My order came out wrong one time and the waitress did not offer to fix it or make a new order.  I don't think they employ a manager.  There does not seem to be any authority figure,  just a bunch of kids running around accomplishing nothing.   I will go back because of the food only!   I will just expect bad service."}
{"text":"Just have to let you know, stopped by here last Wednesday to take advantage of their \"meatball Wednesday\"  that I wrote about in my previous review and they no longer have that special.   It has been replaced with discounted bottles of wine on Wednesday.   Humble Pie is still great though!!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here twice and each time the pizza turned out great. The staff have been very nice and the place is clean. Well worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. Came here for a pizza after a visit to the OdySea Aquarium only to be told \"sorry guys we can NOT serve you a pizza because we are out of dough\" ?. My friend, you are a pizza place...no dough should never be an excuses! I know for a fact that there are other Humble Pie's in the area and know one could take one for the team and drive and to get more...or something! It's poor planning on the management side as there has been this summer special in place for a while and planning should have included making sure staff had enough supplies on hand to make for this to be a profitable evening! 
Sorry but not sorry Humble Pie this one oops has made me NEVER want to return or try your place!"}
{"text":"We love Humble Pie Pizza. Our favorites are the Pepperoni or the Meat Lovers, and the Fig & Prosciutto. This is great neighborhood place, all the servers and especially the bartenders are friendly and attentive. The have great apps but we normally order a Wedge salad and a Veggie salad and both are great. The pizza has the best crust and is definitely better than the run of the mill pizza place."}
{"text":"Humble pie is delicious! Every time we go we try a different pizza, and it's always fresh and crispy! Of course my favorite is the margharita pizza, always a go to and always a great taste! I always get a half veggie salad, which is so crisp and refreshing and light! The dressing is delicious and is similar to a house Italian dressing. We also had the injectable donut holes for dessert (because why not!) and they were so yummy! I recommend the berry and the Creme and mixing them in the holes!!!!! 

The bruschetta is really yummy with fresh basil, tomato and mozzarella. Always a go to as well. 

I also highly recommend the sangria, which is absolutely delectable and I can literally never get enough!! The atmosphere is laid back, and just great service every time! The entire staff is great and has great customer service, we always have a great waiter/waitress! 

When we was pizza, this is where we go!"}
{"text":"A different kind of pizza, which is refreshing in the Valley. I also enjoy the bar setup, it's a good place to have a drink on a nice day. UPDATE: This is one of my favorite places in the Valley, both the Desert Ridge and Hilton Village locations. All day Happy Hour, kids eat free on Sunday, very fun and friendly staff! Tell a friend."}

{"text":"Awesome pie!   Awesome service!   Thanks for spoiling us during our nasty Phoenix layover.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just plain cafeteria type food. Not much to recommend about this place. Service was pretty marginal as well."}
{"text":"So, I've lived downtown for over 20 years, and have had my share of good pizza! The food here was good, but service left a lot to be desired. 

All three of my kids work in the service industry, so I try to be extra considerate and always offer them (servers) the benefit of the doubt. But this time, I just couldn't...

My daughter and I came in on a Sunday evening, around 6-ish. There were only a couple of other parties there when we walked in. A young man walked up to us and asked us if we'd like to sit outside or at a table inside, We chose inside. We picked a table near the back corner, and the server right away asked for our drink order. I think it was then that he realized the table he sat us at was a little dirty, so he offered to clean it. After wiping it down, we gave him our drink order. Our table was cleaned, but, he forgot to give us place settings. We waited a few minutes to see if he was going to come back with some, but after about 10 minutes, we just grabbed some from the table next to us.

He comes back with our drink order, and asks if we would like to order any appetizers. My daughter orders the  tempura fried green beans, and before I can order anything else, he leaves to put the order in. He comes back about 10 minutes later and asks if we've decided what to order. By then we had finished the green beans. I order the toasted ravioli, and then we both order our entrees. I order the meat lover's pizza and my daughter has the grilled caprese. The ravioli comes out fairly quickly, and a few minutes later, the rest of our order is out as well. Everything tasted great. No complaints there.

Between getting the last of our order two more families come in. A party of three and a party of six. There are two other servers that we can see come out to help with the other parties. Once the other parties arrived, we were just short of ignored the rest of the time we were there. Our drinks were never refilled, even as the other parties' drinks (wine mostly) were never left empty. 

We had been done eating for about 10-15 minutes before our server came by to ask if we needed boxes for our leftovers. We say yes, and he promptly gives us a box and the check. I place my card in the bill, and we wait...................for almost another 20 minutes..............all the while, these other parties, I felt, were being given great service. It was very disappointing. I also hate to mention that the other parties were of a 'lighter' skin pigment than us...... 

I just hope that this was a fluke, and a bad night for \"________\", our server (because he never told us his name either!).

I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"The hummus appetizer did not look very appealing but after diving in it was fantastic!  Arugula salad needs one more ingredient, maybe goat cheese.  It's quite flavorless, but not bad.  Service was great!  Atmosphere is great!  The fig an goat cheese pizza was quite delicious and so was the pistachio.  Red velvet cake was blahhh, but the donuts are delicious."}
{"text":"\"Hot Mess\" 
I was expecting something along the lines of  an NYPD Pizza, since this is a local chain, but instead got a cool atmosphere and bad food.  The atmosphere just doesn't seem to fit the food and service vibe. It is also interesting to me that this location gets the lowest YELP score of the Humble Pies - hard to put your finger on it, but something just doesn't seem right.

We were super excited to have another spot coming to downtown phoenix, but won't be returning.

It's seat yourself when you walk in and the staff was not overly friendly at first. Once we were seated our 2nd day on the job waiter came over to take our orders.  He was friendly and got our girls some kids menus and crayons.  

We ordered 2 pizzas and  a bloody Mary. My husband got the Buffalo Chicken and said it was ok and I got the sausage which came with TONS of large onions.  I asked to have a new one since the menu didn't say anything about onions, he took it and then brought it back saying no,that just fennel...um no. But, whatever! So I just picked it off. The pizza was below average and our bill was $37 before tip for just the 2 pizzas and one drink - very over priced.

Our waiter did say to the table just over from us, sorry about the wait - \"It's a Hot Mess in here,or actually I am just a Hot Mess!\" Um Random!

They need to cleanup their act before this location closes"}
{"text":"As with everyone I came here after odysea aquarium.

The wait wasn't that bad as everyone says it is, but I'm not from the area( just visiting).
I should say this place isn't family friendly, there is a bar and lots of people drinking wine and alcohol.

I can say that the workers here are very very clumsy. I heard about 3 glass cups break and about 7 utensil fall to the ground, bring out a bucket or something to clean the tables ! 
Our service was good, they quickly came with waters and ordered our food fast.
It took our food about 45 minutes to come out. A bit long I think I can see why people complain about the wait.

I got a SOP and I can say it was an C average on the food. It wasn't oven roasted or anything fansy. I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed. Nice quaint location. Food was great!! Have to agree with another reviewer...best food in this area...."}
{"text":"Try the mushroom pizza! The flavor blend is just wonderful in your mouth. We went with a CS group, so I had a chance to try a bit of the potato pizza, chicken pesto, sausage and artichoke. All taste goood! but my favorite keeps being the first one. 

Don't be surprised to find the bottom a bit burnt, it is not a big deal. I just enjoyed the cheese they used for all of them."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong, even if it is in this 2nd location. I've tried them first in Scottsdale, and this place comes really convenient close to MIM. This time I've tried the Iceberg wedge salad plus Coppa Ham. I just love the ingredients they use for all. if you know a MIM worker, tag alone...they have a special discount :D"}
{"text":"I wish I could say how the food was but alas, it was not meant to be.
When we entered, there was another family waiting.  After a few minutes, they were seated and the lady seating them said they needed a minute. The place was half empty, but perhaps they didn't have servers to cover all the tables so understandable.  
Went and took my daughter to the bathroom while hubby continued to wait to be seated.  Now, those of you with a toddler knows that they can and do take FOREVER to go to the bathroom.  Get back and hubby is still standing at the front by the door.  Another family walked in.
So, guess what happens?  Someone comes up and seats THEM.  SERIOUSLY?
Our family of 3 had been waiting for over 10 minutes but their family of 5 gets seated right away?

As we were leaving my husband noted that it was probably for the best we didn't eat there.  He spotted a couple of health code violations in the expo kitchen.  Namely cross contamination from the chef's going back and forth between cooked and uncooked food without handwashing or protection.  Also, the chefs weren't wearing gloves.  So it looks like perhaps we dodged a food borne illness bullet."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food was delicious and fresh. The fig & caramelized onion pizza was awesome. Their specialty drinks were yummy too!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the westin kierland villas and felt like walking to dinner and soon Discovered \"Humble Pie\". Delicious pizza  and sphaghetti and meatballs. Monday nights are 1/2 price bottle of wine night. I think there is a special every night so check the website. We ended up having a wonderful evening with live music, half price wine and great food!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food. I had the margarita pizza and my hubby had pepperoni. Fresh ingredients, delicious crust, airport prices. Was very happy with it over all and would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Hit Humble Pie for the lunch special today soup or salad plus personal pie $11.95. I had the creamy butternut squash soup with the chicken pesto pizza. My boyfriend had the veggie salad and SOP pizza.  SOP was the star of the show with their signature sausage!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Phoenix and have now ordered from Humble Pie twice. The location at Desert Ridge. The first time, was good. This last time was very disappointing!  I ordered the pepperoni and added olives. When I got my pizza and opened the lid, I was shocked. I could literally count on my hand how many olives were on my pizza....and it cost me an extra $2 to add olives!  For about 10 olives, $2.  No joke or exaggeration. And I could see more sauce than cheese.  Feel like I got ripped off for a $15 pizza that had only half the ingredients on it.  Was going to order a lot from them as they're close to my house but I can't say I will again.  Disappointing to say the least!"}
{"text":"Please have some consistency! One time I get pizza, it's perfect....the crust is crisp but not overdone and it's just good all around. Then at times like today, soggy and undercooked. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Another great visit to Humble Pie!
Did their Thursday Date Night thing.  Two half salads, a pizza & two glasses of wine = $20
I've always had wonderful food and brilliant service!!!

Don't forget the chili basil sauce :-)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I wasn't sure how long it would be to get a table or what the quality of the food was going to be like (face it: airport food usually is sub par at best). I got a table (it was pretty slammed) for one in less than 5 minutes. The pizza is SO GOOD (and pizza is #1 on my \"favorite foods list\" and my waiter, Eric, was super attentive and fantastic. I highly recommend this over any airport restaurant I've ever been to. Kudos to y'all, Humble Pie!"}
{"text":"The food is great. I dream of their mozzarella cheese.  But the service here was very poor today.  I sat at the bar and was basically ignored my entire visit.  Thank goodness I wasn't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Amazing fried mozzarella.  I am hooked.  No dried out sticks here!   Delicious melt in your mouth squares lightly breaded.  I was at the desert ridge location.  I realizedd my Groupon was for a different location.  My waiter, Aaron was wonderful !"}
{"text":"Burnt Offering.  We ordered a couple of glutten free pizzas for dinner, but both pizzas we received were burnt. A couple of managers came to explain that the glutten crusts are hard to bake and the outside curst may be crispy to ensure the center is not doughy.  We pointed out that the entire bottom of the pizza was black.
They did remake both pizzas, but we still could not believe that they would serve pizza that was obviously burnt and then try to explain it away."}
{"text":"Terrible. 

This spot was going to be the kind of spot I could get quick dinner on a hectic weeknight with my Family. Not So! The Calamari was extremely tough and did not taste fresh. The pizza was just bad. It did not have layers of texture or taste in any way. Just black bottomed and crisp. Not burnt, but a strong sour burnt taste. The center was underdone and very soggy. Just a bad meal. This was my first time eating in, second time actually eating the Pizza. Both pizza's were a TERRIBLE let down."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! This was unfortunately the we worst pizza I have had in a long time! I am staying at the wonderful Andaz Resort across the street. I thought I would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. I am so disappointed. We are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now.  Sad...small...thin...pitiful pizza. You will notice that I never leave bad reviews but this time I have to. Yuck!!!!! I wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for food - 1 star for service. Went there for lunch today. Walked in and two ladies were standing at the hostess desk waiting. We waited for a few minutes until someone came from the back and asked if they were waiting for orders. Did not acknowledge me, make a call, then acknowledged me and directed me to a table. Table looked clean but felt sticky. 

Took 10 minutes to take a drink order and guests were piling up at the hostess desk. At some point there were 10 people standing at the desk, with no one working the area or seating people. Not good at lunch time! 

We ordered sandwhiches. They were OK, run of the mill, not great and not bad. Refills were delivered promptly.  

People do seem to love the pizza and from what I saw they looked great."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I loved it. Perhaps because it was new, or maybe because the pizza tasted better than most of what you can find in the Arrowhead area. Whatever that was is kinda gone now. 

Service is almost always exceptional. Generally happy  and helpful staff, usually quick service. The outdoor seating is great when it's not 110 out. The food is pretty good, and there's some unique options on the menu. 

What gets me, ultimately, is price. Lunch specials are great, but I feel like $15 for a personal pizza is a bit much given what usually comes on them. Our $13 caprese appetizer came with 5 slices of bread (for a table of 4), couple tablespoons of mozzarella,  and some pesto. Again, felt cheated for the price. Their $10 lunch specials are probably a loss leader, but that's the price point I feel makes the most sense for these guys -- at least that's what would keep me coming back regularly.

Maybe I came on an off night, but it was dead for a Saturday night at 6. Maybe I'm not alone in this thinking? Overall, decent food, good service, but just a tad too high on price to make it a regular dinner spot for me."}
{"text":"The Humble Pie near us is a little small but has a really nice patio. 

We like that they serve Four Peaks brews and are fans of their pizzas

The location on Happy Valley has good service and quick, good food. I am glad they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I don't have anything nice to say about Humble Pie other than that they serve wine.  On my first trip I went with two girlfriends, one of which was about six months pregnant at the time.  We were forced to stand and wait for a table despite the fact the place was 80% empty.  We waited a good ten minutes, for no apparent reason, before being given the privilege of being seated.  The service was abrupt and rude.  At least the food was tasty, because I had something to stop my mouth from screaming at the obnoxious locals sitting at the bar.  I was sure I'd never go back there again, but about a year later another friend suggested we pop in for a glass of wine after yoga at Sutra, the studio next door.  Big mistake.  This time, the bartender barely paid us any attention in favor of entertaining another rowdy group of very intoxicated locals at the bar.  I guess Humble Pie is the place for people to get wasted and act ridiculous on a weekday night, no thanks."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE!

This is our go-to spot for my \"cheat meal\" as I eat an entire pizza by myself. I keep it simple, pepperoni and crispy onions. The crust is absolutely delicious, the sauce is perfect, and there are a lot of toppings to choose from. Price wise it can be a little expensive if you consume whole pizzas like myself, but if you appreciate quality taste, it is factor you can look past. Jason, the bartender is an amazing part of this location, his service is the reason we drive to this location rather than the others."}
{"text":"We tried Humble Pie for takeout.  The pizza was delicious. The cost was slightly prohibitive. We ordered 2 pizzas for 2 adults and 2 children and luckily the baby doesn't eat too much. These 2 pizza's cost $25. Both pizzas were great. The kids had the Margherita which my 4 year said was the best pizza he ever had.  My husband and I shared a fire roasted mushroom/pancetta pizza. I loved it but my husband thought the mushroom taste was too strong.  He had a slice of the boys and thought it was really good and will probably order that next time. The pizza sauce was great and the fresh mozzarella was awesome. The crust was really big not giving much surface room for the pizza part and was a little burnt.

I picked the pizzas up and it is really cute inside. I decided next time I would wait to order until I got there and sit and have a drink at the bar. It seemed really cozy.

Lastly, we decided given the cost it would be a better place to eat there rather than takeout."}
{"text":"The chain restaurants in Desert Ridge Marketplace proper can be fun for awhile. Come here when you're tired of them. Healthy eaters will want to try the excellent seasonal veggie pasta. Healthy carnivores will enjoy it with chicken. 

Nice bar with windows opening to the patio. Not Scottsdale posh, but it's comfortable and friendly."}
{"text":"If you're by yourself they only let you sit at the bar, doesn't matter if there's available seating, if you point this out to them they get rude and say that's not for you. They will put you on a list and say it doesn't matter because anyone else can come and take the bar seat before you. Way to make me just hate one of my favorite pizza joints."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Casey was our server and he was super too.  All the food we tried was SO good!  The pretzel with brie was amazing, the fries were amazing and my burger was also amazing (except for the fact that they had no pickles- wah!)  I still give this place five stars because the food was so good, the service was excellent and the dessert of a chocolate chip cookie in a huge pan with ice cream was delicious.  I don't even like ice cream but it was just so good with the warm cookie!  All three people I ate here with enjoyed their dishes as well- I think two people got a kind of chicken panini sandwich that they loved."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, with tasty crust and excellent flavor from the sauce."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I frequent Humble Pie quite often for their lunch special. It's affordable and I LOVE their pizza.

However, my friend and I always sit at the bar and are served by the owner of the restaurant who continues to ask us if we've been in before. He's served us at least ten times. I'm fine with not being remembered, but the thing that continues to irritate me is that he is extremely rude and short with us. The servers there are great, but since we are usually in a hurry we'll sit at the bar. For someone who owns a restaurant, he is surprisingly adverse to positive interactions with his customers. 

2 stars for the great food, but the horrible experiences at the bar are a turn off. I'll still go there and put up with it, but I would advise anyone to sit at a table and not have to tip someone who treats them unkindly."}
{"text":"Roasted mushroom - waaaayyyy over done -like burnt.  Sad it smelled good when I walked up to order"}
{"text":"Located in front of gate C4, it is a great option for a quick hot breakfast. 10 minute guaranteed. The Meat Lovers omelet is definitely a good choice. Served with fresh fruit, toasts and sliced tomatoes was definitely a good way to jump start my morning. The coffee was also ready good, not too dark and served just at the right temperature. 

Rebecca the waitress was very friendly and very diligent, however the hostess had a little bit of an attitude, I normally don't like to write this type of comment on my reviews, but the hostess of a restaurant that it is located inside an airport has to be friendlier and has to provide the potential clients with the information in regards estimated wait time.

Overall I am very pleased with my selection."}
{"text":"I've actually been to Humble Pie a couple of times. In both cases, I enjoyed it. They have a decent wine list (was it a little parred down on my 2nd visit?) and their food tastes fresh and homemade.  Living in Hawaii, we get lots of good food, but pizza is NOT one of them. Humble Pie is a welcome neighborhood place for me to get a quick fix (without the lines of Bianco).

Both times I was there, i was surprised to see that the place clears out by 9PM, because its the kind of place you could go to drink wine and nosh. Its not a \"bar\" scene, but I like it to meet my girlfriends.

In both cases, the service was great. This last time, I swear our server has ESP, the minute I thought something, she was there. We were at a table that was getting a little wet from the misters. The minute we sat down, she saw me look up and there she was, moving our table so neither us nor our food would get wet. (I DID wonder why there was a table there to begin with, but, whatever.) We took foreeeeeeeeeever to order our food, and when we finally did decide, BOOM, there she was. That's hard to do when you have a table like us that is definitely on its own pace. 

All in all, I think Humble Pie is a great neighborhood place for everyone from families to friends. 

If you go: have the prosciutto and pear pizza. And go later for no lines."}
{"text":"Love Humble Pie at their other locations, this location is very disappointing. Have visited several times and not been very happy, but today was particularly bad. Ordered meatballs, they came out cold, not warm but cold. Maybe room temp if lucky. Also ordered a pretzel. It had the most terrible taste, I can best describe it as melted plastic. I will never visit this airport location again."}
{"text":"Great salad, fast service and respectable pizza.  The bar setting makes this a welcoming hangout."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great pizza, salads and wonderful wine list. Comfortable and cozy neighborhood joint with super friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a group of friends on out lunch break. We all got the express lunch special: a 10in pizza and side salad. I ordered the margherita and added olives with a Caesar salad. I liked the pizza but it had less olives than the veggie pizza, which was funny. I tried a slice of the arugula and goat cheese, and that was good too. Overall nice place and friendly service. I tend to prefer the make your own pizza places lately but this was a lot of food for a decent price."}
{"text":"This place makes me crazy. I would really want to love it here. Close to my house, good beer on draft, good salads, good pizza. (Too small for my boyfriend; he's not coming back.) I NEVER get greeted quickly here. I sat at the bar for 10? minutes at lunchtime. and at least 3 people walked by. They must have seen me; it's like they avoid making eye contact and won't offer a glass of water until they have time. This has happened every time I've been there. Once we were seated the service improved, but I had to go from irate to barely satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The Strawberry Salad is wonderful!  The patio is pet friendly and we sat back and enjoyed our meal on a little loveseat with a coffee table.  Very nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!! My wife and I had a lay over over phenix,  We ordered our food it was ready in 5 minutes, service was great the pizza was probably the best pizza I have ever tasted!  I'm going to recommend this place to anyone that comes to Phenix."}
{"text":"If you are wanting a tasty pizza delivered to your door, stay away from the Humble Pie. I was excited to see unique gluten free options as my mother has a dietary restriction. I ordered a meat lovers and artichoke pizza. To my dismay, they were burnt! Good thing my mom still has her teeth otherwise she would have certainly lost or broke her dentures.  Needless to say we won't be ordering from the Humble Pie again."}
{"text":"It is expensive for a strip mall place, no ambience, euro style pizza
It is just ok
Considering all the competition in this space I am surprised they can keep the doors open"}
{"text":"This place is slow, the service at the bar is non-existent and I had to get other people to help get my food and sauce from the kitchen because my bartender/server (Stacey) was terrible"}
{"text":"I have been here several times before and always been happy with the place. the food is always been good and the service was good as well. this time I place a take out order at 830 at night on a Saturday I get there at 9pm and the order is incorrect. they didn't put the sausage on the whole pizza. they had no problem charging me for the topping on the whole.pizza though. Their solution was to tell me that they would just get it done in 2 minutes. I don't understand how my pizza took close to half an hour to make but that they tell me that they can have it done in 2 minutes now correctly? their solution was to throw sausage that looked under cooked to me on an already cooked pizza and to them, that was going to be acceptable? so when the pizza came out with what looked to me like undercooked sausage on it witg a burnt crust, surprise when I didn't want to eat that. the server asked me what was wrong with it like I was crazy. I would definitely pass on this place there are tons of pizza places to go to around here that are far better and don't put what looked to me like undercooked sausage on an already cooked pizza? their prices are way high for the product they delivered. I will not be giving them anymore of my business."}
{"text":"We were hungry before our flight, so there we were at Humble Pie. They have beer, which as we know is required before the cramped seating of SW Airlines. We drank a bit, then shared a 10\" Margerita Pie. It was good. Nothing to write home about but solid good. Enough for two for sure. Unless your like a huge sports guy who pops hotdogs like tic tacs, then get your own. Fast service, and lots of annoying seat wasters not eating anything, sipping their iced teas for hours, grrrrr."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! I like that they put a lot of toppings on and what a deal if you do the $9.95 lunch special! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"It is a bit expensive - I mean it's pizza for God's sake.  Beyond that though I enjoyed the food there.  The pizzas are BIANCOesque even down to very similar toppings.  For me it was about as good as Bianco without the ridiculous wait. Good place to kick back with good friends."}
{"text":"Great experience at humble pie thanks to Alex the bartender.   What a great time.  Alex made us feel welcome and suggested food, drinks while chatting .  He is the reason we will be going back and making it a regular favorite spot."}
{"text":"Cold coffee, asked 3 times for new cup... still luke warm. Piss poor service and the bartending is horrific. I understand the airport is.... well, the airport, but there is a point where $15 a drink should garner some sort of quality. I'd advise you to bring your own food and at this point... drinks."}
{"text":"I understand that at 8:22 am in a busy airport that the pizza ovens werent working but all i wanted was a breakfast wrap.  They seemed really plain though with just sausage, egg, and cheese.  Seeing they had all other pizza ingredients available i asked if they could make mine to order and add basil, green peppers, and maybe some onion.  The girl at the counter said 'sir they will be cold!'  I wasnt concerned with the temperature but she then said well they will be $2.00 extra....which already priced at $8.99 was steep but i wanted something more sophisticated then 3 ingredients.  Then she said $2.00 each!?  I walked away disgusted at the way this business would overcharge customers for a plain breakfast wrap and then screw them over on such small amounts of topping.  Lost my business."}
{"text":"Had a salad to go and you would think they would include utensils.  Nope!  I called in the manager and his response was we assume that people don't need utensils. They're available if you ask.  Seriously not a good customer service response."}
{"text":"This is by far a solid pie, especially for it being located in an airport.   If you travel a lot, you know the crap you can get served and to be expected due to most service workers in the airports are not the pay friendliest - nor than likely due to having o deal with all the stressed-out travelers.  That said, this place is something I always look forward to.  Most of the servers are very pleasant and again, the food is excellent.  

It's also worth noting...it's located in the middle of terminal D and the C terminals."}
{"text":"Just got the Seasoned fries to go! Awesome service, very clean, outside potion and nice Bar"}
{"text":"Ordered online for a pick up. I waited over 5 minutes to even get helped when I got to the restaurant, and then they couldn't find my order. When I got home, the pizza tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. 
I gave it another chance and dined in for lunch one day. The food was definitely better and the lunch special is a good value.  Service again was slow."}
{"text":"This place has terrible parking but fantastic pizza. My husband and I started coming here for their Thursday Date Nights after 6pm. For $20, you can get an appetizer, a pizza, and two salads. It's a great deal!  We both really like their pizza - it's got this fantastic crust that is flavorful and both chewy and crunchy at the same time. A perfect combination! Plus, there's plenty of toppings to choose from - all forming fantastic pizzas. 

The appetizers are pretty generic - fried calamari, French fries, caprese, green beans, etc. None stand out as amazing, but my husband really likes the calamari. Our favorite salad is the Strawberry and Gorgonzola. Our favorite pizza is the Roasted Mushroom as it has pancetta on it as well. Then for dessert we usually order their chocolate chip pizza cookie - warm with vanilla ice cream!    

We normally sit at the bar, since the dining area can be full, but our bartender/waiter has always been super friendly and helpful. All of the staff here are really friendly and I always feel like I'm coming to hang out with the locals. This place has a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Every Thursday night, from 6pm to close, they have a special called \"Date Night\". You and your date can order any 1 appetizer (choose from about 6 appetizers) to share, then each person gets a salad, and then you can order any one pizza off the menu to split. All of this for $20 - it's a fantastic deal! Needless to say, we've been here a few times. We've tried all the appetizers (French fries, fried calamari, tempura green beans, and  1/2 order of caprese) and while none are really my favorite, the husband likes the calamari the best. Our favorite salad is the Strawberry Gorganzola which has a nice balsamic vinaigrette and walnuts. We haven't tried any of the other salads, but they look good. Our favorite pizza to order is the mushroom pizza with pancetta and green onions. Then, for dessert, we usually order the pizzookie (pizza cookie!). You can order it in 6\" or 8\" and it comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and caramel/chocolate drizzle. We always save room for this delicious treat and if it's on the menu, we are all over it!"}
{"text":"Service was crazy under par. Wings were pretty good, soup was eh and the pizza wasn't anything to write home about. The seating is pretty cramped as I could have easily ate something off my neighbors plate without even leaning over.  Average pricing for average food"}
{"text":"Many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale; there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food. In theory this is great! If I'm going to pay more for buying food in an airport, I might as well be paying for something good, right? Problem is, when it goes wrong, I just feel cheated. They should know better!

Take Humble Pie. Theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the Phoenix airport, the pizza they gave me was one of the worst I've had in YEARS. The crust was soggy, the toppings spartan, the sauce sickly-sweet and the greasiness unbearable. When I first picked up a slice, all the toppings promptly fell off. I tried to put the toppings back on, but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it two-handed: first a bite of the crust, then a bite of the toppings.

Really, even if this place billed itself as a super-cheap pizza joint I'd feel cheated."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst pizzas I've ever had especially for that price! $20 for a medium I don't know what I was thinking. The sauce was nothing special the pepperoni still had the outer skin on it I don't know if that's the way they serve it but makes it difficult to eat. Won't be setting foot in that place again"}
{"text":"Food is good, and prices are reasonable. Kids eat free on Sunday and lunch specials from 11 - 3 make this a great place to stop for some pizza with the family."}
{"text":"Wow! My new favorite happy hour spot!

I was planning on seeing a matin√©e at Desert Ridge with some girlfriends on a Sunday and we were looking for a place nearby that offered happy hour on a Sunday. Humble Pie has happy hour every day of the week. YAY!

After our movie, we drove across the street to Humble Pie. It is a wee bit smaller than I expected and a little cramped. It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the patio. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the HH prices. Bud lights for $2 and ANY other draft for 2.50. And while they don't have an extensive draft selection it is a good one. Specialty drinks were only $4. My friend and I had a cucumber gin/vodka drink that was very refreshing and delicious. My other friend had a cranberry martini. I usually don't like cranberry martinis but I tasted it and it was really good. They sprinkle cinnamon on top which I think is a fantastic touch. It tasted a bit like Christmas! 

For food we ordered 2 orders of fries and 2 happy hour pizzas, one margarita and one cheese. Their fries are to die for! They rival the garlic fries at Gordon Biersch. Smothered with garlic, Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Yum. The pizzas were pretty good. Thin crust, flavorful sauce and cheese. We ordered pretty basic pizza so I'm pretty curious about how their more adventurous pizzas taste.

So what was the damage for 4 girls with 4 drinks, 2 pizzas, and 2 orders of fries? Under $40. Such a good deal. And the staff was super nice too. You know how girls can get. Even when the food is gone our mouths keep going and we can sit and talk for hours. But the staff was gracious and patient. They will probably make regulars out of us."}
{"text":"We had cheesy bread, shrimp pizza and meat pizza.. All really good. Toppings were good. Cheese to sauce ratio was consistent. Service was good."}
{"text":"I'm torn about HP been to the 7th St location twice; the first visit was rough n the second was a bit redeeming. The staff is always friendly though n that can go along way. The pizzas are average (do not order the chicken pesto pizza - wth is up w \"fried onions\" on top they were completely dry, hay like n inedible), the salads aren't too bad (the wedge was good) but they do have a heavy hand w dressing which can ruin a salad very fast.  Unfortunately the mozz app was the best thg so far n idk if that's a good thg .. Plus idk how many folks wld be here if it wasn't for Groupon."}
{"text":"This is my first review!! 
Anyway... Humble Pie. My co-worker and I went for lunch today after reading the mixed reviews on here, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I love Pizza, and if it was socially acceptable for me to eat it for every meal, I really would; I think that Humble Pie definitely meets my standards. 

We sat outside on the patio, which normally I would love, accept for the mister/fan system combo, which made my straight- but naturally curly hair- frizz up in seconds. I was surprised to see the place relatively empty for 12:15 during the week, but I guess it's still \"new.\" Our server, a young guy, greeted us right away with glasses of water, and had our other drinks to the table in seconds. Note to Humble Pie: if you leave the sweetener packets on the mystified tables- the sugar clumps together and doesn't come out of the packets! 

We ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad to start and it was amazing! Not heavy, a little tangy, a great mixture of veggies (Asparagus, white beans, cherry tomatoes'), and the cheese was amazing! I'm a big fan of the chopped lettuce! 

Next, we shared two Pizza's: Chicken Pesto with Leaks and the other was a simple Margahrita. Both, were very good! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth, and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. 

The pizza's are small, so I walked away feeling very satisfied and definitely wanting to go back! I bet at night this place is going to be packed! 

Hurray for Humble Pie!!"}
{"text":"I had never previously been here before but with a subtitle of \"pizza wine and spirits\" my mom thought it would be a good place for us to go and have a nice adult dinner and so she got a Groupon and we went. Butttt the second we get there the place is loud and absolutely full of kids. We walk in the door and we can barely squeeze in next to two couples with kids and another lady who were apparently all waiting to be seated. Eventually the poor girl who appears to be acting both as hostess and waitress finally gets to us and we opt to sit outside in the heat rather than stay inside and try to talk over all the noise and kids.

So we go outside and wait for her to wipe pizza sauce off our table and then sit down and at first it's cool because it's quiet, and they have fans and misting but then not five minutes later they seat a family with 3 kids right behind me who start walking around and talking and screaming. So we order a salad but despite sounding delicious, it did not taste very good at all, it was such a let down. And then to make it even better it started raining and they had to rush us all inside and because they didn't have enough tables we had to eat the rest of the meal at the bar. So we get the BBQ pizza and it's pretty good. The only complaint I could make is that the chicken was a bit tough and obviously not fresh but the sauce was good. The biggest problem i had with my night though was getting sick afterwards. Very soon after we left I started not feeling well until we got home and it got to a point that I couldn't move without upsetting my stomach and then I threw up 3 times until I felt better. I'm not sure what happened because my mother shared the same food and only had a little stomach ache later that night but in any case I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Humble Pie for sometime now - finally tonight a close girlfriend and her daughter had suggested that we meet up for some happy hour fun. They have a great happy hour selection of both apps and drinks. We ordered the toasted cheese ravioli, a cheese pizza, their fries and deep fried green beans! All of which were amazing bar food. I ordered their Jalape√±o infused bloody mary which was pretty good. 
I am still looking forward to checking this place out for dinner and trying one of their speciality pies! But simply as a happy hour joint I was super stoked!"}
{"text":"I would like to share an incredible bad experience I shared with friends and relatives at Humble Pie at 64th Street and Greenway in Scottsdale....

Over the last four years we have celebrated my grandson's birthday at this location with a reservation and this time it was for 6:30p....Well on Saturday night all 13 of us showed up to celebrate the birthday and were told we have your reservation but we have no seats.  We asked why and were told by the manager that the owner of this location made a decision to expand another group without a reservation thereby leaving us without tables for us and my 11 year old grandson.

The staff just ignored us and the manager was to busy to even discuss the issue...we finally got seated at almost 8p.....I have never witnessed such disregard for customer service.....everyone was disappointed and to the owner who I am told is Tim Valencia, although the staff didn't know how to spell it, will understand how awful his impact had on all of us and certainly hope he treats his grandson (if he has one) with more compassion.....

Might also add, the restaurant is understaffed and I heard complaints from people on their way out of this beer joint."}
{"text":"Came across this place at the Phoenix Airport.  Ordered a beer I never heard of, Lifted Kilt I think it was called.  It was excellent!  The cheeseburger and fries I ordered were better than I expected from airport food.  Nice ciabatta roll served without condiments but with onion, lettuce and tomato slice.  Burger was juicy and cooked just right and a decent size.  Bar staff was funny and engaging.  The burger/fries platter was $12, beer was $9, not outrageous for airport food and the hot food was as much as you'd pay for a crummy pre-made sandwich at one of the newsstand outlets at the airport, so why not pull up a stool and enjoy a beer while you wait for your flight?"}
{"text":"Don't go. Used Groupon coupon and still paid way too much. Calamari appetizer is smallest ever seen. Low price house wine was horrible - worst tasting cheap wine. Pizza very small portion. Only thing good was seasoned fries. With so many places to pick from to go out- do not pick this one."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great happy hour, and specials all week.

Definitely recommend schreiner's sausage pizza"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. As a fan of bianco I would say that this place is close. Great staff and atmosphere. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I entered the restaurant around 9:10 not realizing that it was closed because there was still a lot of people eating there and the workers happily seated us and helped us with whatever we needed. I was with 5 other girls and it was our first visit to Arizona. 
Our waiter was super nice and really helpful! We had a vegetarian in the group and they were telling us of their favorite vegetarian pizzas and being really accommodating to everything that we wanted. 
We ended up getting 2 fried raviolis, french fries, and 2 pizzas, the margarita and the fig and prosciutto. It all tasted absolutely amazing! 
We stayed until about 10:30 and not once did they try to rush us, they just cleaned up the restaurant and left us alone!"}
{"text":"Love it!! Great pizza, awesome patio. Have to say I like this place more than Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"We ate here on a business lunch and it was awful. Not nearly enough staff and the food took about half hour to come out. We had to get our food to go. I don't really have anything nice to say about our experience. Not really trying to slander your name, it was just the most annoying part of my day eating here."}
{"text":"Since Humble Pie is airport pizza, I need to grade it on a curve, but overall it's definitely nothing spectacular. The crust is closer to Domino's in taste and texture than neapolitan, and they put a ton of cheese on their Margherita pie, but the 8 to 10-inch pie is perfect for a \"light\" meal before a flight. The pies also come out pretty quickly (under 10 minutes, it seemed), so it's a good option if you don't have time for a real sit down meal. The staff is nice and lively, and the prices are fair for an airport. 

Overall, no real complaints, but no real highlights."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I absolutely LOVE Humble Pie! I love their Skinny 0 and Blue margarita cocktails... I love the tempura fried green beans... I love the strawberry salad... The pizzas! BUT... what I don't love is when you go to dinner on a Sunday evening and you are told that you can't order the bruschetta because it's Sunday and they have \"run out\" of a lot of their menu items What????  Please kitchen manager adjust your weekly ordering! If not, word to the hungry... DO NOT eat there on Sundays"}
{"text":"We got the pepperoni and pesto chicken pizzas and the Caesar and vegetable salads. Everything was decent. Great service, but the pizzas weren't something my taste assigned with. Definitely not bad, just not my thing."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the happy hour pricing (on a weekend!). We were very excited to have the cucumber vodka drink (which I can't remember all the ingredients of and want to recreate it but they don't post their drink menu online that I can find). 

Anyhow, our waitress at the start seemed attentive as we kept asking her to give us more time as we decided what we wanted. She took our orders without writing the items down and had to come back to ask me what I said I wanted as my side (again) and how I wanted to cook my burger (didn't ask the first time). I was watching the clock as I normally do when happy hour comes close to an end and we didn't see her for nearly 10 minutes. At this point happy hour had passed by and I no longer wanted a drink. Even when our food came she didn't come to check on us to see how our food was. When it looked like we were wrapping up with eating she brought the check to the table. My friend said \"Excuse me, I actually want another drink.\" It was like she was trying to rush us out of the restaurant even though there were about 10 open tables nearby. I'm not really sure if she was new or just trying to get out of work. She brought my friend's drink about 10 minutes later and brought the check with the drink. Again, I'm aware this isn't Mastro's but I'm not sure why we were being rushed out of the restaurant when there were a few other tables other than us there and plenty of open tables. We sat around after her drink had completed for another 30 minutes and never had our water replenished. 

They can definitely up their service game."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant  on YELP 
while on vacation. Great salads-wonderful pizza. We split a large salad between 6 of us and three pizzas. We did order two appetizers and had a 2 bottles of wine. Extremely well priced. We will come back for sure next time we are on the area."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch options. I had the  meat lovers pizza with a cup of minestrone soup.  The food was served hot and fresh.  However, after the initial service, things slowed down noticeably.  Had the service stayed consistent, I would have given them 5 stars.  Good food."}
{"text":"I've only been here for carryout during lunch a few times. And have only had the chopped salad. That, though, is delicious. The half size is a hefty lunch, full of turkey, salami, mozzarella and a vinaigrette. The last time I had it, it tasted kinda...florally? I dunno, it was weird like flowers. All the others have been great! Staff is friendly and only once was it busy - but I usually go at an off-lunch time."}
{"text":"Excellent Thursday night date night special for $19.95-a pizza, appetizer, and 2 small salads.  Food was good as was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Barely edible. Overpriced. Eggs swimming in oil, cold bacon, week old fruit. Ok if you are starving otherwise skip it."}
{"text":"When you're good you're good!!! Nuff said!

After you have Humble Pie go next door to Urban Cookies. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I want to like Humble Pie. I really want a great, locally owned place close by with a cool yet unpretentious bar and good, modern food & a fun, simple atmosphere. I guess I want a Postino in the NW Valley.

Unfortunately Humble Pie just doesn't deliver. 

The bar is kind of cool with indoor/outdoor space & the menu would be nice if the food was good. Unfortunately the selection of beers isn't great and the food is greasy & not particularly good. For example there was a pear/goat cheese dish that could have been great, unfortunately it just wasn't. The pizzas are kind of bland, burgers are greasy and service odd (our kids food came out 10 mins before ours).

If Humble Pie got a Gordon Ramsey makeover, it could be awesome. Until then, we'll pass."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. We walked in after a great experience at the aquarium. We purchased the after 4 deal with a $10 coupon off to the restaurant.  There was 6 of us. The man behind the counter said they were going to clear off a table so we waited for 10 mins. With 4 children. Then a woman came out and said her boss told her to tell us they were closed. Then who I'm assuming was the manager walked by and said the kitchen closed 6 mins ago. We told him we were waiting for our table to be cleared off but he said they were closed and wouldn't make a 6 min exception. Obviously the reviews are not very good. It's unfortunate that they would refuse business in such a family entertainment district area."}
{"text":"Wait wasn't that bad considering I went during dinner rush, I was seated after a few minutes the waitress was quick to clean a table and move one for my boyfriend and I. Since there were a lot of people the food took a while which I don't mind so after half an hour I was like well maybe we should order dessert since it takes a while and ended up getting dessert before my food. The pizza was okay I think that it could've had a little more cheese so all of my toppings wouldn't fall off with every bite but no complaints I paid $4 for The pizza and cookie after using my coupons from the aquarium. Maybe I'll go back at a slower time or before I go to the aquarium instead of after."}
{"text":"Not only was the shrimp pizza the best pizza in the Phoenix area but our service was as good as at a ***** star restaurant. Unbelievably good"}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS SERVICE BASED ONLY! 

Let me paint the picture for you, Sunday night about 630 pm. There is one,15 top(approximated) on the patio, and inside there were 8-10 other tables with 2-4 people average at each of them. There were 4 total waitresses, 1 hostess, and 1 bus boy. Every waitress had approximately four tables each.

After we were sat, we place our order within 5 minutes. We ordered 1 salad and 1 pizza. First of all, it took 45 minutes for them to bring out the WRONG salad! Then it took about another 8 minutes for the correct salad to get delivered to our table. Our pizza took another 20 minutes to come out, which was somewhat understandable because of the other large table.

Our waitress came by sparingly to bring us waters and ask about our food. However after our pizza was delivered, she asked how it was, we answered briefly, and she scurried away, not asking if we wanted our EMPTY drinks refilled. We ended up having more interaction with the hostesses/ than our own waitress.

I caught her numerous times texting on her phone and talking with non-dining patrons (i.e. her friends) all night. Also, multiple times she looked at our table and walked the other way, and because of that, it felt like we were getting ignored. 

At the end of the almost 1.5 hour dinner that should have been no longer than maybe an hour, I had to get up and go to the new bartender (who came to work on his day off because of the dysfunction of the waitresses) and asked him to cash our check. The reason for that is because yet again, our waitress JORDYN, was talking to her friends at the hostesses stand. He promptly took care of it and apologized for the service.

This was the worse service I have ever had. It's unfortunate because the food is great here. Overall, JORDYN had chances to provide better service, but decided to text and chat instead."}
{"text":"I am a little shocked to see that this place has the ratings that have. This was our first time in and we had excellent service and the food was delicious. There was so many options we didn't know what to pick so we had our server help us out. He suggested between the shrimp and the meat lovers and with a toss of a coin SHRIMP was the winner. Sounds strange, looked ever more strange, but don't let that fool you this pizza was full of flavor! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at a couple different locations here in the valley.  Both times for Sunday's kids eat free deal, which is great!  The buffalo chicken pizza is the best thing we've tried so far.  I also enjoy the fig and prosciutto which is very good, with the exception of the goat cheese being too overpowering.  Next time I will order it without.  I have also had the mushroom pizza, which had good flavor but was a little dry (no sauce).  Have yet to find 'their best pie' but I'll keep trying til I do!"}
{"text":"The patio was my favorite part and the HUGE cookie/ice cream dessert for 3. I should have just ordered that and said on the perfect patio and enjoyed the party in my mouth instead of wasting my time with the pizza! 

The pizza was not in my ball park of quality. It was super dry and the crust was too hard. I do like the choices they give you as far as being creative so I tried the clam one and the artichoke one, .... displeased with both of them. 

Ordered a couple of appetizers for happy hour, that was overall a cool pricing, but the regular prices are pretty steep for the amount of food you get. We also ordered a salad, very pricey but good."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great happy hour. We got the express lunch with a 10 inch pizza (Chicken Parm) and a Cesar salad and it was soooo good. And we got sangrias off happy hour for 5 dollars. Service and food was awesome. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really a 2.5...the point 5 for convenience to my gate...had the hot wings...they delivered the \"hot\" but were pretty tasteless...add salt.  They are long eating so will keep you amused and occupied while you wait...they look MUCH better than they taste...can plug in...but NOT all tables so ask...server was attentive,  beer was Cold!"}
{"text":"My wife has been here a couple of times to meet some girlfriends for drinks after work.  She said there was a pretty good happy hour, and that we as bould stop by for dinner sometime.  So we did that tonight.

When we first arrived a lil after 6pm, there definitely was NO dinner rush.  Only a few tables were occupied.  So we were promptly greeted and seated at one of their high tops and presented menus.

We took a few minutes to check it out.  Something we couldn't help but notice... two other separate couples that came in after us not only got serviced first, but also got their drink orders before anyone even stopped at our table.

Once we did get service, it was pleasant and friendly.  We ordered their chopped salad and roasted mushroom pizza.

The chopped salad had a good dressing, but it was pretty light on the meats and other stuff listed as ingredients.  It was almost all lettuce.  It would have been nicer to have a lil more \"umph.\"

The pizza was rather bland.  You definitely got a fresh mushroom flavor.  But the pancetta and green onion didn't provide mush for flavor.  I'd suggest maybe adding some garlic or more herbs/spices to kick it up a bit.

All in all... we will probably try the place again.  If not this one, maybe the Desert Ridge one, and see if it gets better with other menu selections."}
{"text":"Our favorite Artisan Brick Oven style pizza in Scottsdale! Great thin crust! Ask for a side of their garlic aioli to dip the crust ends in! Great lunch special - pizza and a salad for $10! The meat lovers and chopped salad is a must have!"}
{"text":"Disorganized, noisy and too many tables in such a small place. There was no hostess stand and it was hard figure out where to check in. Wait staff in street clothes so impossible to know how to ask even. (no seat yourself/wait to be seated signs even).  The decor was boring and minimal. They had on some obnoxious 80's music playing way too loud. It was very cold too. Thw patio doors were wide open and it was low 50's out. Our waitress was really good. The food was so so. I shared a pizza which was good. My dad ordered.spaghetti which was just ok. Overall it was a so so experience. We figure they are still trying to work out the details. We will probably go back since they are only about 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Went to Humble Pie for the first time tonight.  Wandered in on a Saturday night at 5:30 and were pleasantly surprised that they have Happy Hour specials on the weekend.  Had a great Four Peaks Amber Ale.  We opted for the Bruschetta which was tasty and ordered the Happy Hour Pepperoni Pizza.  Everything was delicious and nicely prepared.  Our server was very good and very friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These gourmet pizzas are anything but humble.

We split a caesar salad and a marinated tomato & arugula pizza.  The pizza was awesome.  The arugula complimented the sauce and cheese quite well.  The quality of the ingredients was worth the $12.95.  If you think that price is too much for a pizza that size, you can always order Domino's.  I happen to prefer to pay extra for quality.  The salad was good.  There was nothing special about it.  Standard caesar.

A pretty cool feature is the pizza \"bar.\"  Humble Pie has an open view of its pizza oven with a few seats in front of it.  The restaurant was slammed on Friday night, but there were a pair of open seats there, so we opted to eat at the pizza bar instead of waiting 20 minutes (or sit outside in the cold).  It was pretty amusing to watch the cooks make the pizzas.

The happy hours and lunch deals look really good.  Humble Pie is right down the street from my new home.  I have a feeling I'll be stopping in quite often."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for french fries, so of course I ordered the garlic fries with my pizza. 

A cute and cozy spot for a date night. Wine too. And great happy hour specials. This is soon to be my regular spot!"}
{"text":"My office is 2 doors down from this location and you'd think after 5+ years I'd get sick of this place. But it really has it all. Forget about it being just another pizza joint. It's best features are the lunch specials and night time patio bar. 

The lunch specials are an excellent value, with some combination of pizza, half sandwich, soup and salad. It's the perfect amount of food and the salads are all amazing. 

At night, HP becomes the local watering hole with a friendly staff, local beers on tap and a decent wine selection. 

Honestly, it's just a great relaxing atmosphere away from the boujee late night all too common in the Desert Ridge Area. It's really easy to come for lunch and then find yourself staying for late night conversation with strangers and regulars at the outside bar."}
{"text":"Service is friendly but slow. I totally understand as packed at it was. 

Candice offered service with a smile and even acted surprise at my boy's excitement at having lost a tooth just before we were served. I brought my son in here to grab a slice before the children's museum.

We must have just beat the rush because once seated,  it was lined w people waiting to be seated. My boy (7) was the only kid in the place but he's cool. It's got a good happy hour from 11-6. I just missed it. Beer selection is limited but cocktails look mighty drinkable. 

My son ordered off the kids menu (noodles with butter) which is always nice. Oh and kids eat free on Sundays! I ordered the artichoke pizza and it was really good. I love brick oven pizza with a soft crust, really good cheese, fresh veggies, and great seasoning. I added peppers and Parmesan to mine because I felt it needed a little more kick. Over all a great eating experience. Noise level was a little higher than I expected but considering the size of this restaurant and the number of tables in there it was understandable. Would have liked to hear the music a little more though. Sounded like good tunes.

I will definitely be back!

Xx,
Reesie"}
{"text":"Great food & great service!  We were originally heading to Rice Paper for some pho but got sidetracked by the idea of pizza and decided to check out Humble Pie since I had heard good things about it.  We split the veggie salad and goat cheese pizza.. both were fantastic! Our watier was kind enough to warn us that the large salad was huge and he was right - the small version was what other restaurants call a dinner size and it was more than enough to share as an app.  When our waiter accidently forgot to bring out my boyfriends beer (which was really no big deal) he followed up with a complimentary drink as well as a small beer for me \"so I didn't feel left out\" :) We really aren't the type to care about a lost drink order but it's really nice when someone goes out of their way like that.  We will definitely be back, probably often!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the Humble Pie in Desert Ridge, though I had once been to the Scottsdale location (where I wasn't terribly impressed).  This time, however, I was quite pleased.  They had a nice lunch special for $8.95 (I think), which was for a personal size pizza and a salad (greens or caesar).  The personal pizza is supposed to be one particular flavor per day, but our waitress let us know that we could choose any from the menu, which was a nice touch.

I went with a pepperoni pizza and the caesar salad.  The caesar was nice, good flavor, and a fair amount of parmesan.  Another nice touch was the mesh wrapped lemon, keeping those pesky seeds out of your salad if you want fresh lemon juice on it.   The pizza, though, was definitely the star of the show.  Not only was it packed with pepperoni, this pepperoni had a great flavor to it.  Also a plus was the nice crisp crust...you could tell it was cooked perfectly, and that it came straight from the oven.  

The worst part of the meal was that I totally spaced on getting their version of the pizookie!  Minus one star to me!  Four stars to Humble Pie though."}
{"text":"Never did I ever think I would find myself enjoying airport food, yet here I am. I had a margarita to drink and a margherita pizza (didn't do that one on purpose but the theme worked in my favor). By no means was it the best food/drink I had in my life but I tend to expect very little from airport bar food, and was pleasantly surprised. With my pizza they served some sort of spicy mayo for dipping, which added a nice slight spice to the pizza. Pizzas took around 20 minutes but that's okay because they were made fresh...a rare find in an airport.  The pizza style is a thin crust, similar to a Punch Pizza."}
{"text":"Better lighting is needed in the evening.  Keep coming back because my girls enjoy it but I have to say the service is below par.  They just pass you on by after being seated for 10 minutes and when you ask for assistance they look at you as if you are a weirdo.  Won't make a scene but definitely letting the girls k ow that we will never be coming back.  One time I get it but every time we come in not about it."}
{"text":"The ingredients are unlike any other I have had. Our party ordered the parmesan chicken pizza, meat lovers and the buffalo chicken pizza (complete with celery). I can't forget the desert pizza either! the only thing I would say is if you're gonna be with a lot of people make sure you order a couple pizzas. We had 7 and 3 pizzas was just the right amount."}
{"text":"Airport food. I got the margarita pizza, they were a little on the expensive side. A little bigger than a usual personal pizza. It was pretty tasty -I ended up eating all of it in one go. They took about 10 min to make it, it was alright"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings ever! Calamari appetizer was amazing. Great service as well. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid airport food. Ordered two pizzas and they came out fast (ie didn't have to worry about missing boarding). We got the sausage and the roast mushroom. Both were tasty with fresh toppings and a nice chewy crust.

Food was good, the beer was cold, and the service was fast. What more do you want from an airport restaurant?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday because of the Kids Eat Free promotion and it is a decent value because for each Adult, two kids (12 and under) can each get a free meal off the kid's menu. However, the kid's menu doesn't offer much and the kid's mac and cheese is kraft, even though they have a homemade mac and cheese on the regular menu. The inside is very small and tables are so close together that the wait staff often bumps into you/your chair as they move about, plus it was very warm inside (middle of the day, late August).

The salads are swimming in dressing, the hot sandwiches get soggy after a minute, and overall, the food is over priced and mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Had the bbq pizza which tasted great, good service, but too $$$. Check for groupon first!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch during a conference. We had the bbq chicken lunch special and it was yummy.  Our sever qas Fern who was really cool and made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"my wife and i come here probably 2-3 x a month.  great fire baked pizza made in the back of the restaurant.  if its chilly - sit by the oven in the back.
the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars not 5 is the low def tv's - come on, pay the extra $10/month and give me my HD!!  nice outdoor patio too.
one other huge plus - 4 peaks Hop Knot on draft in an iced glass! yay!"}
{"text":"I love Humble Pie.  They have a great lunch special and a great Happy Hour.  The service is always great and there is rarely a wait.  The goat cheese pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"The pizza is very expensive and in my opinion not worth it. $13 dollars for a personal pizza. I was hungry, but not that hungry, and I should've just waited until I returned home. But, flights always seem longer than they are, and it was right next to my gate, so it was convenient.

I had the chicken pesto pizza. It could've had more chicken. The crust was too dry for me. And the price....maybe we are paying for the little box it comes in? It was good tasting, but if it gets cold, it's not good at all. Better to eat it while it's hot and share with someone. 

If you do eat here, listen for your name and really watch out for your order because people who ordered after you but had the same thing will try to take your order!"}
{"text":"For a place where time is so precious, somehow my pizza spent too much time in the oven (burned). This may have been after they shaved precious time off assembling my nearly $16 personal pizza but only using a fraction of cheese. If burnt crust is your thing, then choose Humble Pie in the Phoenix Airport!"}
{"text":"Money. Pizza was fabulous. Almost worth moving north to be closer. Recommend it. My wife loved the French fries and so did my two boys. I thought pizza was great."}
{"text":"Soooo delish. Had the S.O.P. pizza and the flavors were great. Nothing on the pizza overpowered any of the other flavors, they went together splendidly.  This pizza felt like comfort food. Yum Yum. Also had the antipasto board. Loved everything on it. Lastly, the spaghetti and meatballs. Oh lord. The meatballs were amazing and the pasta cooked to a perfect al dente.  All in all, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Humble Pie really shouldn't be Humble any more...this place is awesome now!  

House made Burrata...house made mozzerella...fabulous meatballs, tasty sauce on the pizzas, wild mushroom mix...the pizza, caprese are both amazing...great service and speedy for take out.

We tried the wings and they are so so...but everything else was extraordinary.  

Don't hesitate this place has been remarkable the 3 times I have visited recently!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon expiring on May 6th, so Mom and I swung by after work.  I'd called in my order to dine in, since a. Groupon requires dining in, no take-outs, and b. I know that HP closes at 9 pm- it was 8:35 when I called.  I did not know the menu off-hand since it had been years since we last dined at HP, but I asked the person on the phone what kind of white pies did HP have to offer.  He listed about a handful, and I decided to go with the Chicken Pesto, since the Ricotta with Egg contains prosciutto (I only like crisped prosciutto).  I told him we'd be arriving shortly.  

When it looked like we were going to arrive a few minutes after 9, I called again to say we were on our way, and could I add a salad before the kitchen closes.  He said I could definitely add the salad, and would I like to take everything to-go?  I informed him I had a Groupon to use, and he said not to worry, I may still take the items to go.  Well, sure!

I walked in, and they all looked like they were ready to go home.  I'd even say that the guy I introduced myself to as the one on the phone who ordered the pizza and salad seemed annoyed.  He handed me the small (!!) personal-sized pizza box and told me someone was making the salad.  Um, that's the only size you offer, and it costs how much??  Hmm... is this what happens when I arrive for takeout?  A personal-sized pizza for $15 and a large Strawberry-Gorgonzola for $13?  Good thing I have a Groupon to use.  

Expensive pizza, but delicious (hello, pesto sauce) and satisfyingly crispy!  My stomach started to rumble and cramp, so I then thought perhaps HP uses corn flour or corn meal in its dough to make it so crispy-licious.  A phone call made a few hours ago confirmed both corn flour and cornmeal are used.  You've been warned!  I think $15 is too pricey for pizza made from super-cheap ingredients- I'll pass!

As for the Strawberry-Gorgonzola salad, I can't eat strawberries and pecans anymore, so this was for Mom's enjoyment and nutrition.  It looked very nice, and portion seemed decent for the $13 price tag.  Don't know if Mom enjoyed it, though.  I'll update soon when I get an answer.  Mom did say she didn't like the pizza.  I have to say my body didn't like it, either.

This HP location is TINY, but in a cozy, intimate way.  Too bad I can't order the pizzas here, since I liked the space.  It also is in the same plaza as Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonades, so I thought I'd frequent this pizza shop more often.  Sorry to say I won't return.

5/12/18
Noticed that there's still leftover salad from HP in the fridge.  Usually Mom inhales strawberry-gorgonzola salads as the flavor combo is delicious, but she said this one wasn't.  It had been refrigerated for a few hours, with dressing safely on the side, so it wasn't as fresh as when it was first thrown on the counter..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Mom a few months ago- calamari app and a pie.  Calamari was alright, nothing to rave about, and certainly not something I'd order again.  Plus, the batter contained cornmeal (corn allergy), and I'm not a fan of anything that contains cheap ingredients, esp. those that do great harm to people's health!  The pie wasn't memorable at all- I cannot even remember which one we had- it was that mediocre.  The first pie was charred all over, why it was allowed to leave the kitchen and served on a table, we'll never know.  I do give management some credit since they quickly replaced it with a better-looking, yet non-scintillating pie that had more dough than toppings.  Strike three: the noise level was ridiculously high, and the restaurant was only at 50% capacity.  You won't find me dining here on a weekend night based on the terrible acoustics alone.  No, you won't see me spending my money here again."}
{"text":"Humble pie is a solid 4 star restaurant. Been to several HPs throughout the valley and they are quick and easy choice for a nice pizza meal. Especially when there is a Groupon offered or on their Thursday nite date nite then the prices are very reasonable. Last night we came in to get something to eat before a movie and had a $20 Groupon and ordered the mozzarella cheese bites and the egg pizza which were both excellent. Perfect amount of food to share and the bill was very close to $20. Had great service from Matt as well which made going to Humble very nice. Been to this location 3 times and each time we've had great service and good food. You bet there are better places to go in town for gourmet pizza but if you don't fee like driving far and want something casual then Humble will satisfy your pizza craving."}
{"text":"My flight is massively delayed and this restaurant is right next to the gate. I looked at pics on Yelp and read complaints about soggy pizza.  I didn't risk toppings to make it soggy. I also requested my plaint pie to be cooked well done. 

The dough wasn't soggy.  If it was cooked well done then I'm afraid to ever eat a non-well done pizza.  The dough at its thickest point is the texture of a soft marshmallow.  The cheese tastes pretty good. The sauce is too sweet for my preference. Overall, I feel like I'm getting exercise with all the work I'm putting in eating the dough. 

The employees here move slow and don't seem excited to serve. The 3 stars are given with generosity."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Service was too slow due to being short staffed. I had to send my pizza back twice because there was so much corn meal on the bottom it was gritty and not worth eating. Had to ask for refills more then once and also ketchup for the fries. No wonder they are giving Groupons for this place."}
{"text":"First time I have been to Humble Pie and was glad to see that they opened one near my home on Happy Valley.  I added this place on Yelp and not even 12 hours later there was already 2 bad reviews for the service here.  I am sure they are still working out the kinks since our service was just okay as well but nothing to get \"panties in a twist about\".  We had a big table and sat outside with the nice heaters, the atmosphere was nice and new inside.  We ordered a side of french fries, fried green beans, and caprese for appetizers.  All of these were just great since the beans and fries came with mayonnaise based sauces that were awesome.  The caprese was different with cherry tomatoes (not my fav), liquified mozzarella, pesto, bread, and oil & vinegar.....although different I thought it was still very good but my wife did not care for it.  We both ordered pizzas, I had the SOP (sausage, caramelized onion, & peppers) and this was a great pizza with lots of great flavor.  The pizza is thin but the end crust is pretty thick and very good.  We will definitely go back and I am sure Humble Pie will work out the kinks on service but we were glad the service was decent for us."}
{"text":"First time there. Staff friendly, Food was good. I did order the app bruschetta  and it's a build your own, i didn't care for that. No big deal though. The pizza was good. But overall probably won't go back unless I have a coupon or try some happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Humble pie pizza restaurants.   Humble is right, The pizza is very similar to grocery store frozen pizza, their primary competition.  The pizza is below average, small, unoriginal, and has a large price for what you get.  Go do something original and provide a great product at a value, $20.00 is not a good value for a 12\" pizza.  Maybe not 12\" but we were all left hungry.  You can't feed three people on one pizza."}
{"text":"If you have nothing to really do and just want a basic lunch in a cozy environment I say go for it. I dont know what the pie is so humble about its not that great. With all the other choices for food in scottsdale I say look elsewhere for an interesting time."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food.  Everything we ate was Quality!

I do love the location.  Not far from my house, great neighborhood, not sketchy (so you don't have to look over your shoulder as you walk to your car), quiet area which closes down around 10pm.  

Like the atmosphere and the service.  Only negative is how small the place is.  Dining at 7pm, the tables were full, place was packed, and so incredibly loud it was impossible to participate in conversation.  But oh well.  Monday Night Football was on the TV, so no conversation was actually necessary."}
{"text":"I had the BLT pizza and the salad with strawberries. First off, the crust had no flavor, seems fried although it wasn't, salad dressing was balsamic but very heavy and strawberries were mushy, obviously not fresh.  Won't be back.  Service was good though, but food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is right across from one of my favorite hang-outs, The Main Ingredient. I've seen this place numerous times and one day we saw a Groupon for them, so decided to purchase it and give it a try. 
The place was fairly dead for a Saturday night. I had always seen this place packed when passing by. Maybe we missed the rush? 
The service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again. Wish we understood what all the hype is about. Maybe we just ordered the wrong pizzas?"}
{"text":"The layout of the restaurant is nice. Unfortunately we weren't given the option to be seated outside. We ended up  staying at the bar to eat. The bartender was attentive, friendly and funny. 

That being said, the pizza was nothing to rave about. It looked beautiful but lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a massage for happy hour - Andrea was great ... friendly with samples and Phoenix recommendations ; got a local draft (hop knot, yum) and the tempura fries - freshly fried and good.

Will bring the family back for the unique selection of pizzas and the gluten free option. 

In a nice strip mall...clean and friendly- and the windows were CLEAN (ask the tender)!

Would recommend that HP starts to delivery to the Residence Inn by the Mayo Clinic- they would make a killing!

Cheers HP"}
{"text":"The food was solid 4 star but it was at the airport so I am jumping it up a notch. My taste buds were simply blown away!! Ordered the S.O.P which has sausage, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, ricotta cheese and tomato sauce. The sauce tasted very tomato-y and fresh, the cheese was perfect, the sausage and onion complimented and the crust was crispy but not burnt. Really great pizza that I would happily eat outside of the airport walls."}
{"text":"Ok. So I've been here a few times and I have always had reservations (pun intended) regarding the value of this place. I'm finally sold...sometimes a good wine just takes time to appreciate (another pun considering they do half off wine on Groupon). Nonetheless, I have to say that the food (pizza, sandwiches, apps, salads, & more) here is terrific, the service has been awesome (every time). So in a twist of irony, my phone (halfway through this review) died.  Guess what happened next?...yep, the young bartender (Aaron) just happened to offer his Apple iPhone charging services and the final test is a wrap. Even extracting the battery death recovery, this place gets 5 stars. Good for family, dates, or just rolling solo...and if you feel like grabbing a barstool-ask for Aaron. The draft beer tastes great too. ;)"}
{"text":"Had the mushroom and pancetta pizza here and tried their Bloody Mary.  Overall, decent food for airport.  The pizza is thin crust, crispy, but with enough bite.  Flavor is good.  Bloody Mary is okay.  My server, Mia is great.  

One of the better food and experience I had at an airport."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to like Humble Pie, but I just can't. I've been to a few of the locations over the years and am always underwhelmed by the food. I've only ever tried the salads and pizzas. I do enjoy the chopped salad, but am always disappointed by the pizza. I'm not sure if it's the quality of the ingredients, the sauce, the dough, but there are so many better pizza joints out there. 

On a good note, the service has always been great and the ambiance and atmosphere of each location is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky that I work across from Desert Ridge.  The pizza selection is the best; their sirloin/chicken chili is the best as is their salads (I'm not a big salad eater).  Great bar service and daily specials."}
{"text":"Although not huge fans of the pizza it is decent. But what is great is their calamari. It's probably one of the best calamari appetizers I've had. The grilled chicken and peppers sandwich is excellent as well. Service is decent but not great. The music can be a little annoying when he hit the pop stations that remind me of the mall. Overall though a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch and loved it. Tonight we did take out. Me, the pretzel with delicious gooey Brie cheese along with a refreshing strawberry Gorgonzola salad with candied pecans. My husband ordered the meat lovers pizza and ate the entire thing. For a pizza restaurant the prices seem a tad high but the quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"The best host is Miguel . Just impress which he could work at my store . Most clever personality. He helped me with everything I needed"}
{"text":"I really didn't think this place was great at all. The pizza, which I assumed was the main attraction, wasn't even up to par with a digorno frozen pizza. The whole brick oven thing is great, and has a good effect on the crust, but my pepperoni pizza was a big letdown. I've never seen so much grease pooling on a pizza before.   

Two stars because I didn't have to pay, which was lucky for me."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here before seeing a movie. We started with the Humble Pretzel, which was awesome! I highly recommend it. Then we split the Chopped Salad and Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage pizza. Both were as amazing as the pretzel. Topping it off with a few beers and some great customer service made this a memorable experience that I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Very good experience. The pizza was great and the toasted ravioli were a great starter. The pizza cookie is one of the best in town. They did put in an order for the wrong pizza at first, but change it as soon as they realized what happened, with no questions, which was fantastic."}
{"text":"I thought the people sitting at the table behind us were just whining when they sent back thier pizzas (4 of them) for being burnt for the second time. Our pizzas also came out  burnt. Service was poor, only was able to speak to waitress once as she disappeared for most of our time there.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not good. 
We had the veggie salad, toasted ravioli and the S.O.P
. pizza. The avacado in the salad consisted of two small slices of avacado and was more lettuce than the other veggies listed on the menu. The ravioli was chewy. The pizza was soggy, and just not very tasty. 
There are a lot of great food options in the downtown area, I would suggest trying some other place nearby."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is so friendly, nice seating and atmosphere but those are about the only positive things at this Humble Pie's cooking staff is terrible. They do not keep tickets in order, stop for social chats and giggles despite a back up of tickets, and then finally serve over or undercooked food. I get it's an airport location but have some standard."}
{"text":"I stopped to grab a bite during a layover, the time it takes for the pizza to come out is pretty long for being in an airport, they do let you know that it will take 20 minutes and ask if you can wait. 

The pizza itself is ok, it's not bad but there's nothing that stands out about it either. It is a bit pricey but again airports do tend to cost a little more. 

The crust of the pizza is very light and cooked well with some crisp however you have to eat this as fast as you can to ensure it stays hot and the flavor is there. Mine started to taste like the cardboard box as it sat there. 

Wouldn't rush back to eat here."}
{"text":"I made a large order on Uber Eats yesterday so my visiting relatives could have a nice relaxing dinner prior to a restless night and 3 AM flight out of here. The order was missing two peoples' meals, the restaurant went unavailable on Uber Eats, and they did not answer the phone for the rest of the evening. The food was tasteless, aside from the doughnuts which tasted like old, dirty oil. Additionally, we all became violently sick a couple hours later. They had to reschedule their flights back home, and lost hundreds of dollars because of this restaurant's food. I am angrily writing a Yelp review from the fetal position on my bathroom floor right now, when I desperately need to finish three pages of my thesis due in a few hours, because of this restaurant. We ate pizzas, wings, toasted ravioli, mozzarella sticks, a grilled chicken sandwich that was absolutely awful, and doughnuts. 

It's two days later, and I have been removed from Humble Pie's delivery radius. This is perfectly fine with me, but LOL."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5. I would expect the pizza to be a lot better just because it is a Pie place. It was good but I've had a lot better. The thing this has is great ambiance. I love how low the lighting is. Dark tables that are turned perfectly so you don't feel like you are apart of other people's dinners. Great fire from the oven and open area bar. Had a good solid wine. We got the cheese board which was good. We both got pizza but like I said it was good just nothing special."}
{"text":"Better than the N. Scottsdale Rd. location! This Humble Pie still serves up good sized portions of food for lunch, with better prepared pizza. I had the salad and pizza combo ($9.95) and tried the veggie and S.O.P. pizza. The veggie salad was a fairly large portion, with an even amount of vinaigrette dressing and toppings. The S.O.P. pizza had a nice balance of meaty sausage, creamy ricotta, sweet roasted peppers, and caramelized onions with tomato sauce. The pizza crust was cooked better than at the other location, with no char around the edges and a lighter tasting dough.

Service was friendly and attentive.  Drinks were refilled as needed. We used a Groupon and had no problem redeeming it. This is definitely a good place to go for pizza if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Tasty wood-fired pizza with more uncommon ingredient options for your pie. There's a cute patio area too that you can dine in when the weather's nice.

We came here and got the express lunch special. They have 3 different options, and we chose the pizza and soup/salad option for $9.95. I had the minestrone soup and the roasted mushroom pizza. The soup was hearty and full flavored, with chunks of spicy sausage, veggies, and pasta. One slight negative was that the pasta was overcooked/mushy. The roasted mushroom pizza had a nice earthy taste from the mushrooms, some salty bites from the pancetta, and creaminess from the fresh mozzarella. There was no sauce on the pizza, and I did miss the tomato flavor on the pizza a bit. The crust, while a nice balance of crispy and chewy, was burnt around the sides. 

Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed.

They have great happy hour and \"date night\" specials that I will definitely take advantage of if I'm in this area and craving pizza."}
{"text":"Enjoyed sitting outside at their bar. Service was excellent, didn't get the bartenders name but, her baby was due on my Birthday :) Really enjoyed both of our pizzas. My husband ordered a meat selection with the red sauce and I ordered off their white side of the menu with goat cheese and dried I believe dates. Both were really tasty. Nice evening all and all."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I tried it for the first time last Thursday night.  We sat outside which was nice because they don't have too many tables (maybe 10 at most) but they were all full with nice friendly looking people.  I was kind of surprised the dining room inside was so empty.  But, Im used to smaller crowded restaurants in LA.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The pizza was just amazing!  I was happy to see new ideas and fresh toppings- not just another California Pizza Kitchen.  The crust is thinish and doughy at the same time.  My boyfriend and I agree the pizza here kicks Mozza in LA's butt!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and we decided to go get some pizza near our hotel since they mentioned happy hour on their menu. I ordered the happy hour pizza on the menu and confirmed with the manager four times about the price and he answered that I would get the hh price. After we got our checks they charged me regular pricing for dinner and when I brought it up he flat out denied it. The server covered it with his own money which shouldn't be happening. Just the experience of him lieing and being the manager made this place kinda horrible. I don't mind paying the dinner price but it would be nice if the manager didn't act that way and treat the employees like that. I feel bad. I made sure to tip the employee well. Btw, first time reviewing on Yelp because I feel it's necessary."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Humble Pie in Peoria due to a Groupon offer I could not refuse.  We arrived around 11:30 and were immediately seated.  We ordered two beers, one small Caesar Salad and one pepperoni with black olive pizza.  Apparently there is only one size pizza and your can not order just black olives, you also receive green olives.  The beers arrived quickly as did the salad.  Midway through the salad, the pizza arrived, and what a pizza.  There is no elevated tray for the pizza to rest on nor is there a pizza slice server.  My wife's first attempt at taking a slice from the plate resulted in most of the pizza topping sliding off the pizza!!!  On top of this, the green olives do not taste good with the pizza.  I asked the manager to come over and complained about the pizza sliding off the crust.  He explained that the pizza is an \"Artisan Pizza\" and is designed to be eaten with a knife and fork.  I also mentioned the arrival of the pizza during our salad.  He said he could make it up for us but it was too late and we just wanted to leave.  I would recommend the entire staff be sent out for Customer Service Training."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday afternoon with a group of my girlfriends! I love the feel of the place and the menu had a great selection. I tried the pizza and it was so good. But my favorite was the minestrone soup!! Hands-down one of the best I've had. I wasn't feeling so great. But I'd love to go back and try this place again probably for a date night!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour drink specials 11-6 and food specials 3-6
(Not to mention their weekly day-by-day specials)

Humble Pie is exactly that, a humble environment with the atmosphere of a relaxed pizza pub almost out of denver, or portland but in Peoria, Arizona. From countless, delicious wood fire oven pizza's, good beer, friendly and welcoming staff, to a little special industry discount for all in the serving industry I'd say humble pie past the front door is everything you'd expect with a little more.

Great location to boot; with all big corporate restaurants lining up and down bell rd, a nice convenient spot for great food, seriously affordable prices, and little to no wait! $2.50 drafts during happy hour, and $9 pizza/salad for lunch.

5/5 even if its not the best place I've been too, I really can't complain about 1 thing. Well done!"}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her birthday. I had a burger, fiance had some pasta and mom had a pizza. All the food was very good. Service is slow and un-attendng though."}
{"text":"Stood at the door for 8 minutes before being acknowledged. Pizza had limp, cool, flavorless dough."}
{"text":"I was needing pizza's for a customer as close to 11am as possible. I called around to 5 other pizza places who had no interest in helping me. I called them and told them my predicament and they were more than willing to help me. Not to mention their pizza was very good!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really, really enjoyed dinner here...my wife and I had calamari, the fennel salad and 2 pizzas (forgot which ones..).  Really fresh tasting ingredients, nice menu choices and nice atmosphere.   Service was spot on too!!"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon and even then I felt ripped off. Ordered meat lovers pizza with artichoke for $3 more. Total cost $20. Skimpy on everthing. Had to search to see if I got each meat. Did they put on pepperoni? Oh, there's one. For the extra charge, I think we got one artichoke heart spread over the ENTIRE 12\"pizza. What a ripoff. Cost me $11.82 with tax after the Groupon. Papa Murphy's will give you a bigger, really loaded one for less than that. But you say, \"you have to cook it at home\". Why not? You won't miss the ambience, this place had none. I felt I was sitting in someone's garge with a bar. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Ordered kids mac & cheese with fries, kids cheese pizza and small sized strawberry Gorgonzola salad. Their pizza is one of our favorites- wood fired and have never been disappointed. Salad is also well dressed and tasty. Generally go here for happy hour, which is a great deal!!"}
{"text":"It was a bit cramped and noisy in this place.  The acoustics in all of these new industrial-esque type restaurants are terrible!  I've read over and over reviews of great restaurants and the yelper's main complaints being the deafening music.  I experience it more times than not if I patronize trendy places.  The food here was good though.  The seating is uncomfortable a bit and tables too close together.  But again, I've had very good pizzas here from simple pepperoni (the pepperoni they use here is excellent) Had a fig and goat cheese and prosciutto one and because I love all things fig, I was very pleased by it.  Chopped salad is awesome.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Would go back...just wish it were a little quieter...."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon and had a great time! My wife and I felt,very comfortable here. We'll be back for sure. Rizzo was our server and was fantastic."}
{"text":"From the looks of yelpers photos, some people had bad luck and got some really bad pizza, but from the attitude of this place, I would not be afraid to send it back to the kitchen and let them know about any soggy crust because it appears the kitchen WANTS to serve delicious pizza. Very attentive and patient servers even amid all the chaos of people coming and leaving and ordering to-go.

With that said, I was lucky to get a perfectly cooked magherita pizza ($10.95), lots of mozzarella toppings and some basil, the crust was thin, crunchy and chewy at the same time and STILL good the next day (for breakfast I heated it up in the microwave and finished it in the oven, for lunch i had the last slice cold, still. so. good.)

It's 4 stars only because it's on the pricey side, but otherwise I had a very satisfying pizza. Trying the chicken parmesan next time like the server enthusiastically suggested :)"}
{"text":"This place kind of sucks.  I was interested after hearing about the place and mixed reviews from friends, but my experience was rather disappointing. 

The place wasn't busy being a Sunday afternoon so, I would have thought the service would have been better than it was.  It took a while for our order to be taken but, the items came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Ok. What ever.  It wasn't until our server left that we realized that we had no flatware or napkins.  After a few minutes of waiting to catch their eye, I just grabbed stuff from neighboring table.  During our meal, we weren't checked on or offered refills at any time.  It also took about 20 minutes after we finished for our server to offer the check and dessert so, to speed things up, I gave them a card to ensure it was promptly brought back. At that point, I didn't really care if there was mistakes on the tab, I just wanted to leave and get a bottle of water elsewhere.  

So, that was the service part of it and then there's the pizza.  

Tomato sauce can make or break a restaurant and on that note, the pizza sauce was a little too tangy for my liking so, I'm not faulting anyone for this as this is my taste.  What I am faulting for is personal pizza here is definitely not worth $13.  There wasn't much on it to feel good about paying that and when the crust was too flat so, when everything soaked in, it has to be eaten with utensils.  

If this dough was an even thickness, I think it would have been awesome but, the fact they tried to make a bowl where the thinnest part was wafer thin hurt the end product.  

In any case, I came, I saw, I tried.  

With all of the crappy corporate places in the area, I had high hopes for this smaller chain and was let down."}
{"text":"This place is far from Humble. The chopped salad is wonderful and that has certainly been confirmed by other reviews. My wife thinks they use a little to much salad dressing but the Food Man likes his salad wet. One thumb up and one thumb down. Next time we'll get the salad dressing on the side. Their pizza is 12\" and a nice size for splitting. Margarita pizza tasty and not too spicy. All and all for $29 bucks including tip a pretty good deal. The Food Man usually hits this place when staying at the Marriott so I've eaten there a few times and never been disappointed. Give it a try you'll like it. The Food  Man did. :)
Chow For Now"}
{"text":"Went to Humble Pie at 6501 E. Greenway Pkwy. in Scottsdale for lunch. The food was very good, however the server and service was terrible. Server made it very apparent that he did not want to be bothered, and had zero for personality. When we received our bill he charged us $3.25 each for water with lime. I WILL NEVER RETURN THERE and will tell everyone about this!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey even for an airport location.  $16.49 for a individual pizza but it was freshly made and came out piping hot and quite tasty. The service was friendly and efficient and I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't more of a line, but the young lady working the register kept things moving!"}
{"text":"Excellent. For 11$ I enjoyed an omelet that filled half the plate, breakfast potatoes, fresh fruit and toast with jelly and butter. It was delicious and quickly served. Very reasonably priced for airport food."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this location. Right next to the living room the food is awesome service is awesome too! We will be back many more times. The happy hour specials and express lunch are great!"}
{"text":"Went here after a soccer tournament at Reach 11. It was Saturday night around 7pm and the place was packed. No problem with parking at all, got right to a table. It took about 10 minutes for a server to notice we were there even though we were seated there by a hostess and we were right in front of the kitchen window hard to miss.

The food was ok, ordered the fresh mozzarella fried and cheese bread. Both were awesome to say the least. My daughter got the kits spaghetti and meatballs and she loved it. My wife and I split a pep pizza which was good too. 

Desert was their doughnuts with carmel sauce, these to say the least were phenomenal my wife who hates sweets actually wanted to get another order they were so good!

Over all the atmosphere is dark and noisy, not a great date night place, but the food is good. I have had better, but you couldn't beat the freshness. I would go back, but this is not a place I would seek out personally. My biggest complaint is the red sauce, it's almost just tomato sauce and no seasoning. Other wise everything else is good, I think they had some new staff on Saturday night which would explain the delay in service.

I wouldn't skip this place if you are by it, but I wouldn't drive long to get here. Not a great place for groups in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopping in for lunch at Phoenix airport, in between flights. We had Jarron for our server and he was awesome. Customer service and food recommendations were spot on. We ordered chicken BBQ pizza and chopped salad for two of us to share.  It was plenty of food with no leftovers, which is just what we hoped for. We would definitely recommend and will stop in again."}
{"text":"Bartenders sweet. Food good. The banter and inappropriate language from the kitchen is what gave this only 3 stars...while I do not mind I felt really uncomfortable for the elderly lady sitting next to me. I heard the F word several tines as well as the N word..1 have to believe whoever in charge here has to know and shame on them for not running a tighter ship."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, but it was expensive and small for the price. $11.99 for a personal 9\" pizza was a bit steep, but it was still very good. I liked the flavor and the crust a lot. Next time I'm at PHX I would likely come here again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience ordered the prosciutto and pear pizza  that stated that the pears were fresh..much to my surprise the pears were not fresh, they were soaked in red wine and ruined my pizza..."}
{"text":"Date night. We decide to stop into Humble Pie, they always have great food. Tonight, we walk in and it's 89 degrees in the restaurant - why?!! Because they have the patio windows open. Why? No one is sitting outside. Not sure why in the dead of summer you'd have the windows open and not crank up the AC to compensate. Not to mention wait staff was sweaty. Bad experience"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Im a vegetarian and I found this place to have a good selection and what I ate was tasty to boot. I went for lunch on a saturday, they had a special 9\" pizza w/ salad $9.95ish in price. I had the goat cheese pizza it was about 4 slices and the veggie salad (avocado, jicama, white beans, green beans, tomatoes, house mozzarella, herb vinaigrette) honestly the salad was better than the pizza. The pizza crust reminds me of a sweeter version of true italian pizza- thin, crisp, personal sized."}
{"text":"Food is good, not exceptional. Pizzas are mild in flavor. My favorite would have to be their parsley, garlic, lemon zest fries. Service is great."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 2.5/5
Happiness - 3/5

I have a group that comes here for Happy Hours and I just don't know why. The food is fine, and the happy hour prices make the price reasonable. But I have ordered virtually everything across the menu - pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and apps, and nothing stands out. It is all just fine, but there is simply nothing exciting.

But really, it's the drinks that sink this place. I have learned to stick to the beer and wine because the mixed drinks are uniformly terrible. I have yet to taste any alcohol, and the sweet mixer always overpowers everything else in the drink. The beer menu is very limited, and the wines are run of the mill stuff that you typically would get cheaper buying the bottle from Total Wine.

The staff is always friendly, but very slow. Again, I typically come with a big group and it typically takes about 20 minutes... to get our drink (which, as stated, is typically a glass of wine or a beer)."}
{"text":"Excited at first to try some Humble pies, however, my experience was a bit different than expected.  I went during lunch time, not as busy as it could be but a good crowd of lunch goers.  They have an \"express\" lunch menu for about $10..pizza and either soup or salad.  Well, service was really slow in getting the food out, especially a ceasar salad.  The salad came probably 15 -20 minutes later (seemed LONG), and then right after (like a minute!) the pizza.  The salad had HUGE chunks of celery which was weird to me since it's a Ceasar salad.  Tasty salad though minus celery.  The pizza, oven baked and thin.  Good not great.  Cheese was odd.  They had cleared my table and I was waiting for awhile, server had gone around my table yet too busy to come over and had to ask for the check.  Umm...if someone ordered on the express lunch menu probably means eat and go.  I was there for an hour or so, so not really express in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"I'm really dissapointed in this place. I've been coming here since it opened. And these past few times it has been really unprofessional. Today on sunday, me and a few friends had come in to have some drinks at the bar, and maybe get something to eat, only to walk in to see the bar filled up with children, looking to be under the age of 10. When asked why the said because they had no room. Which is a lie, the entire covered patio is vacant, so instead of sitting at the bar , me and my four friends were forced in to a small table in the corner. I understand it's hot outside, because we didn't want to go out either, but it took me 21 years to sit at a bar. Food is still good as always, but I expect a little more professionalism in a pl ace like this."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite neighborhood joints. Service was attentive, and listened almost too well. But that was okay, we got two delicious pizzas out of it, and the accommodated to us with the bill, too. I fell in love with their balsamic vinaigrette on the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Only complaint is that if you choose to get chicken on your half salad, they give you a whole breast - it feels off balance!

The mixed drinks were delicious, and flavorful instead of cloyingly sweet like many places make them. The pomegranate martini was incredible, and the limoncello margarita will continue to give me wet dreams. Swearz.

The fact that I can get egg on pizza, and that they locally source ingredients creates many points in my book! I loved the place! The environment was perfect to facilitate conversation as well!

OH! And Cameron, the guitarist? I am a fan! I can't find him online!"}
{"text":"Well, before they allowed people to choose their own toppings, no one could order what they wanted. I was not allowed to substitute bacon for prosciutto, so I had to order something else. When they finally did allow people to choose their own, I was joking to my friends about how it might end up costing $30 for one pizza. And it did (for about 3 toppings). At least I could make a joke about how un-humble the pie was. It wasn't even that good, there are many other places, like Parlor or Spinato's, that have great flavorful pizza, so it doesn't make the most sense to eat here."}
{"text":"Grabbed a $10 chicken sandwich between flights.  It was okay and it came with pretty good shoestring style fries.  The wait was too long though."}
{"text":"Wow.  I wasn't expecting such an awesome pizza from inside an Air Port as such this isn't your typical pizza joint. Yes there are very few choices, and yes this was pricey but I can honestly say I had a great experience customer service and food quality wise. 

I picked the Chicken Pesto which had generously marinated in pesto grilled chicken chunks, fresh mozzarella, crispy onions, and cherry tomatoes.  The crust was airy, chewy with a light crispiness which I enjoyed.  It took about 15 mins to get my pizza and it was well worth the wait.  If you're in a rush don't go here otherwise if you're in the mood for pizza this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Small beer glasses. Only one TV but its nice and big.

The beer glass is way small compared to the water glass. And the bartender pours WAY too much head."}
{"text":"Warm beers, dirty bar, burnt pizza and no customer service. We are stuck in the airport terminal or else we would have left and found a better spot."}
{"text":"Good food! Sundays kids are free! Great service! Loved it! I recommend any kind of pizza and the strawberry and Gorgonzola salad!"}
{"text":"Only average pizza for a high price.  Staff not very friendly the evening we stopped in to eat.  Very busy though and we had to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this location.  I  experienced something I have never encountered in 61 years of dining in restaurants. Getting a charge for soda water. For 3 waters the waiter added almost 10 dollars."}
{"text":"It's Sunday night and I'm craving gourmet pizza.  Where do I go?  Cibo?  CLOSED.  Pizzeria Bianco?? CLOSED.  Parlor??? CLOSED.  Soooo... I decide to try Humble Pie.

I wanted to love Humble Pie.  I really did.  It has really good company on that stretch of 7th Street between Virginia and McDowell (The Main Ingredient is next door; America's Taco Shop is close by and I've heard great things about the Coronado Cafe), but Humble Pie just... falls short.

4 stars for location; 4 stars for ambiance (very chic); 5 stars for service (so friendly!), but - maybe - 2 stars for the actual pizza?  The crust had a great texture (lightly crispy exterior, but nicely chewy), but no flavor.  The pizza was over sauced and the sauce tasted like it came from a can.  The cheese was good and the basil was actually exceptional (which threw me off because they present it shredded, and I am used to nice, whole leaves on Margherita pizzas).  The cumulative effect?  OKAY pizza.

If it was a Sunday and I HAD to have pizza, might I go to this place again?  Maybe.  But I'd probably just wait 'til the next day and get one of those proven pizza pies from places close by - Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Great service!!!!! We ordered Tempura-Fried Green Beans, calamari and Caprese.  Yum yum.  We also shared 3 humble pies:  shrimp pizza, fig&Prosciutto, goat cheese.  Plus dessert cookie & ice cream.  Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here tonight for dinner. It was some of the best pizza we have ever had. And the staff (Especially Hailey and her sister) went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Thank you for such a great experience, cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"after you taste it
you might be disappointed
in your grandma's pie

Being a baking dilettante, I had attempted pie crust in the past, with horrible results.  I was convinced that you needed to have a special gene to get it right, or you had to make it hundreds of times to learn how to make that elusive, flakey crust.  Crust is key in pie, and if you are not using lard, you're doing it wrong.  Humble Pie's crust is pie crust perfection personified.  

Next, the filling.  Always locally sourced and organic, therefore seasonal. There will be no strawberry pie in the winter. It's all about local availability. And there will be no preservatives as well, not that it would be an issue once you taste it. These pies will not last long enough to need them.

Aside from the standard crust topping, there is a crumb topping on some pies as well.  Both are flawless.

Now, like anything this good, availability is limited. They are available at a few local farmers markets and at a restie called Sara's Place in oh-so-tony Gates Mills. They can also be ordered for pick-up I'm pretty sure.
If you spot some humble pie, just get it. OK?  OK!

Carry on."}
{"text":"Slow service but good food.....   dining area is really small"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything we had here. We started with the pretzels, which were huge and soft and stayed soft throughout the meal. The dips were both good. The chopped salad was awesome and I almost ate the whole thing myself, leaving little for my husband. The Schreiner's pizza was good, although I am not sure if it was any better than  a regular sausage pizza. The service was really great, too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a pick-up order on the veggie salad, SOP pizza, and the prosciutto and pear pizza. The veggie salad was a little scanty on the vegetable servings. I most likely won't order that again. I would recommend eating the SOP again - it was full of flavor from the sausage and roasted peppers. I wish I could recommend the prosciutto and pear pizza, but unfortunately there were no pears with the pizza!! How can you forget the main ingredient??"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Humble Pie a few years ago from friends that live in Phoenix.   I've always liked this place. Service is prompt and waiters are friendly and attentive. 

Humble Pie offers a variety of unique pizza options. Most recently I tried the \"shrimp\" (topped with house-made mozzarella, shrimp, herbs and lemon zest). It was an interesting combination of ingredients and tasty! Our table also decided to share the apple and arugula salad (jicama, tomatoes and greens with a lemony vinaigrette). The larger portion was the perfect size for 3. The name implies there should be apples in it. I was confused because there wasn't a single slice.  

This place can get to be a little expensive when you order a couple pizzas and have a few drinks so dig for some coupons or check their website for \"deals\" on specific nights during the week. Happy hour might be a good option too. It runs from 11am to 6 pm. Most wines by the glass, specialty drinks and draft beers are $5. The best deal I found was right from their website. It lists a coupon for a free pizza if you spend $20 or more."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is absolutely, stupidly delicious.

We came here for lunch on Memorial Day, after seeing it a few weekends ago while we brunched at Tryst. All the patio/bar doors were wide open and we had a view of the giant wood-burning pizza oven.

We decided to be fat (Hey, it was a holiday! MERCA!) and ordered the fries as an appetizer. Holy. The crispy, not-too-fat, not-too-thin pile of fries (Looks can be deceiving: The bowl they came in hid about half the order. So much.) were tossed in AMPLE amounts of Parmesan, red pepper flakes, parsley and lemon zest. I honestly could have made a meal out of the fries and left a happy camper.

But of course we didn't. PIZZA! Continuing the fat theme, we shared two pies: The artichoke was covered with juicy 'chokes, caramelized onions, various diced olives and ricotta. The contrasting mellow ricotta versus the tangy-salty olives and artichokes was delicious.

The potato and roasted garlic pizza was just straight up unnecessary. I mean that in the best way possible. The combo of potatoes and rosemary is just a tasty classic, while the Gorgonzola added a perfect POW (To be honest, I would have liked a slightly stronger Gorgonzola choice, but I know not everyone shares my sentiment). I would have liked the potatoes to be a teeeeeensy little bit more done/crispy, but that's really the only \"complaint\" I had, if you can even call it that.

The crust on the pizzas was absolutely sublime. Charred underneath, flaky and crispy and almost...buttery? DIVINE. 

All in all, I can't wait to come back to Humble Pie. We need to try so many more of their pizzas! And their fries...once I get to the gym 84 more times."}
{"text":"The food and service was okay but the prices were outrageous. I ordered the calamari appetizer. It wasn't very large (definitely not shareable) and didn't even come on a bed of lettuce. So I asked for a side salad but they charged me for a regular entree salad. I don't think I have ever spent over $25 (before tip) for a lunch anywhere before. I just had iced tea. 
I definitely cannot recommend this place because of its ridiculous pricing."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was not so good. Took about 15 minutes for the server just to acknowledge us. She seemed more occupied by making plans to go out with the table next to us then serving her tables. It just took forever to get anything ordered then delivered. We spend about 2 hours here when it should have been a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Ok.  It is the airport and the airport has crappy food right?  Well, Humble Pie is the exception.  They have a nice selection of creative pizza pies.   One of my favorites is the fig and prosciutto.  But you cannot go wrong with the Margarita, sausage or meat lovers.  The meatballs are my usual go to item since I don't need the carbs.  The beer and drink selection are on point.  Most of the bartenders are experienced.   They cannot make a Gibson but most places no longer carry cocktail onions."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Humble Pie. It has a relaxed atmosphere with low lighting. A lot of items to choose from with great service. We enjoyed the mac & cheese, the bbq chicken pizza, and the donut holes. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Not what it once was. My husband and I popped in after a movie. Saturday afternoon 4:20'ish. There were open seats at the bar and no one in the small dining area. We sat at the bar. I hit the ladies room right away to let out some smuggled-into-the-movies iced tea. The handle to flush the toilet was BROKEN OFF. wtf?!  As I walked back to the bar the blonde female server dropped an f bomb while in conversation with 2 off-the-clock servers who were posted at the bar. I actually moved my seat to hear less of their conversation and collective f bombs. I've got a potty mouth myself but wasn't in the mood to hear people chat it on a pseudo smoke break while they are still literally at the table w you. Our bartender was new but did a nice job, very conscientious. Tall male Hispanic late 30's. The food was ok. The cherry tomatoes were soft and gushy. Gross. They have $3 drafts and the beer is cold so I'll probably go back but this place has been sliding slowly downhill since it opened.  I hope you can turn it around but at this rate it won't be a great loss if you close. Except maybe to the new bartender, who was the only person working who seemed to give a f."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible horrible service!  Who know's how good the food is.  I never got to try it.  After being seated and waiting for over a half hour, I had a server run by telling me she'd be right back........I never saw her again.  I finally gave up.  I certainly would never try this place again.  Good luck to those who do."}
{"text":"I ate the egg pizza. The crust and toppings were good. It wasn't the best pizza I have ever had. The waitress asked if we wanted avocado and never mentioned there was an up charge which was annoying. Overall, I would only go back if I had to. Not to choice for pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I went back to Humple Pie with a free pizza coupon. We went again during happy hour. This time we tried the all meat and the fig pizzas. We also got the chopped apple salad and a few cocktails.

Humble Pie has grown on me. The pizzas are scrumptious, and the happy hour deals are good. They also put coupons in the val-u-pack circulars frequently, so that'll keep me going back."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best wood fired pizza I've ever tasted. My husband and I drive about 45 minutes to go here. I could eat here daily. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.

Had the sausage pizza and fried ravioli, both were good.  They had some type of plumbing issue that made the restaurant smell bad, but we ate on the patio so the smell didn't bother us.  We will probably return in the future."}
{"text":"While on vacation the family stopped here and all the pizza was outrageous. Cant wait to return back to Scottsdale so i can eat there again. Ordered the Margherita pizza and was my favorite so far!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a Caesar salad I have not liked....until today. The pizza was okay...honestly the best part was the crust. Will NOT be going back. Pizza Hut is better than this place."}
{"text":"I'd say a solid 2.5 stars, if that was an option.   The restaurant was neat looking, I really liked the atmosphere and decor, and found the service to be awesome.  It's just that the food was so unbelievably meh.  C'MON! With competition like \"the parlor\" and \"pizzeria bianco\" you'd think they be cranking out some really tasty pies.  We had the pear - gorgonzola and the egg pizza.  Lemmie tell ya, I shoulda been weeping with flavor-gasm after eating such  tasty titles.  I have pizza blue-balls instead., FTL. 

I wouldn't say no if someone wanted to buy me dinner here again, but I certainly wouldn't volunteer my soon to be unemployment check dollars here either."}
{"text":"Good, not great. The salads looked great and like the better bet. I had the pistachio nut pizza and while they warned me there would not be much sauce on the pizza, i was a little surprised that there was absolutely none. This made it taste like I was eating nuts on bread which wasn't terrible but I didn't ask for the recipe either. 

I liked the set up of the place. We ate outside which was great but even inside, they have huge open windows that give it a great feel. 

I will return and try a large salad and maybe go to 4 stars. It's hard to imagine that the food would ever rate a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Over priced mediocre pizza. One size pizza (skimped on the cheese) and a medium drink was around $18. ??? A lack of dining space makes it less attractive. Yeah I know it's a terminal but still disappointed."}
{"text":"Had their \"SOP\" pie after finding a Groupon for 50% off, and was thoroughly satisfied with the quality of ingredients, and flavor.  It wasn't the \"best\" pizza I've ever had, but it was certainly delicious.  I have no problem recommending this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This review is for the 7th street location. Last year my we dined at the Greenway Parkway location in Scottsdale and did not enjoy it.

Okay, so not wanting to cook or grill on Memorial Day my husband & I decided to go out. The restaurant that we went to first had a small parking lot with no spaces left. The restaurant that we went to second was packed with only outdoor seating. So, the universe must have wanted us to try Humble Pie again and I'm glad we did. My husband had the mushroom pizza, he added sausage to it and said it was better than The Parlor. I ordered the grilled provolone tuna sandwich which was outstanding. It's a wee bit salty, but I like salty.

I was debating whether or not to deduct a star because of the subpar service we received from our waitress. No smile. No refills on water. No questions regarding our meal."}
{"text":"Used to love Humble Pie, but my last two visits scared me off.  Two visits ago my wine came in a dirty glass.  That's a small issue and I just pointed it out to the waitress, assuming she would replace it.  I watched her pour my wine from the dirty glass into a new glass and bring it back to me.  Yuck. I asked, and received after she checked with the manager, new wine and new glass.  Hey, stuff happens and this one occurrence I let slide.

This last visit, though, there were unclean things all over the place.  Tables were sticky with goo.  Menus and table placards had food and unrecognizable goo all over them.  The plate at my space was dirty and went ignored when I put it at the end of my table to be replaced, so I finally had to ask for a new one when the appetizer came.  Glasses were clean, though!

That's just too many issues for someone I trust to bring me my food & drink."}
{"text":"Redemption!  Did Friday Happy Hour and they took great care of us.  Two of us snagged one of the last open 4-top tables while we waited for the other two to show up.  Within 15 minutes the place was packed and stayed so for the two hours we were there.  We weren't hassled for holding the table the 20 minutes it took everyone to show up, but took care of us with drinks and fries while we waited and checked in on us often throughout our stay.  HH priced drinks were very good (they could use a better selection of white wines though), and HH priced food was great.  I know they're just fries, but these guys make some killer fries!  Thin and crispy with garlic and parsley and cheese,  The HH priced pizzas were good, but seemed slightly undercooked yet again.  Extra star is for the excellent service even though we were only ordering off the HH menu and there were many waiting for our table."}
{"text":"Bar and counter seats are first come first serve, and yes you can order food. 

With that out of the way, this is a very busy spot especially when you've been delayed on the lower C gates (it's located between the higher C gates and the D) I was able to find a spot right away, didn't have much time, was only delayed an hour. 

Thy had a pretty good beer selection, will serve it to you in a glass if you want. The server was friendly and talkative as he poured me my pale ale, it really took the edge off, and he was right back to see if I needed my bill, was able to get one more brew down and paid for before my B1-30 boarding group was called. 

Want to come back for the pie."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or $$$ at either location, there is not one single thing about either location that is good. Service was horrific and the food was even worse.!"}
{"text":"Humble pizza pie,  7th street of Phoenix, where all your amazing local eateries are located at!  If you are craving for pizza and an amazing time come here, it's small but not too small interior gives me like urban wooden cabin feels? If that makes any sense to you review readers! But I like it, when you walk in you sit yourself anywhere you like actually. They always have a daily special and HH is daily too from 3-7pm drinks/ appetizers. So let's get into the food, definitely check out the basket of fries and let me tell you it was huge  for 4.50 you can't go wrong with skinny fries, seasoned to perfection. Also I love getting Margherita pizzas, so I ordered that, they have that item on the HH menu, you get a 10inch and shareable for about 2 people! It was just what I expected fresh and full of flavor! Draft beers and cocktail selections aren't that bad as well! Service was to a tee, awesome and on point. Other than that no complaints, obviously ! Definitely check this humble place out if your ready to dig in and enjoy friends companies or yourself! Ok Phoenix stay cool, stay hungry!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good.  Came out relatively quick, which is good to know in an airport setting.

Problem was that although it looked and tasted pretty good, it was a mess to eat.  A lot of the topping came right off the crust when you tried to pick up each slice.  

It was also a bit pricey for a 10in pizza.  But it's an airport.... Nothing is cheep!"}
{"text":"The rudest customer service I've experienced in forever. It was very early dinner not overly busy and we stood in the doorway with no acknowledgement for several minutes. We needed a table for 6 people and a high chair. The man helping us could have pushed together a two top table and a 4 top in a manner that the high chair would by no means have been sticking out creating a fire hazard. That is without a doubt. Instead he insisted on us sitting in a space with 2 people on the other side of a big wooden beam. In the course of us trying to figure this out this grown man rolled his eyes at us not once but twice! It was so rude and disrespectful. I walked right out as obviously I did not see the situation as one that would improve."}
{"text":"As a party of 9, we showed up about an hour and 10 minutes before closing. We were seated at the back of the restaurant with a great view out the windows.  Unfortunately, the staff had already started putting the chairs on top of the tables surrounding us.  It was so off-putting that we agreed to leave and go to the other location after we finished appetizers.  We mentioned to our server why we were leaving and his response was, \"I can take the chairs off if it's bothering you.\"  Still didn't take them down, so we left and had a great experience at the other location. FWIW, the appetizers were great."}
{"text":"We were at the Odysea location and left due to a poor experience. We called this location, and they were happy to accommodate our party of 9.  The food was super tasty. We ordered cheese, buffalo chicken, pesto chicken, meat and a combo pizza. Probably top 3 out of all the pizza I've had. The sauces were fresh and subtle and the cheese was high quality. The server was awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't rated this place before.  I love this place.  Great pizza, I have tried a few but the pepperoni is by favorite, the meat is zesty and gets some nice crispy spots, the cheese is delicious as are the fresh tasting sauce and perfect thin crust with puffy rim.  

Try the ceasar salad, it is fantastic.  Sometimes we swing by just to get them to go.

Their white sangria is amazing, I normally don't drink white wine but you have to try this, it isn't too sweet.  Try it!!!!  

Great happy hour prices and specials.  Fries are good with their aioli, interesting wings too...and they come with jicama sticks.

It's really nice place for date night mid week.  Always good service and great bartenders."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Humble Pie for lunch or dinner. The Caprese is awesome - different twist on this appetizer with burrata cheese and warm cherry tomatoes. Really good lunch combos and specialty pizzas - my fav pizzas are the Grilled Chicken Pesto, BBQ Chicken, and Prosciutto & Pear.  

Nice, chill atmosphere - not one of the cheaper pizza spots in the area but the lunch specials are really reasonably priced and I've heard they have a good happy hour. Service can be hit or miss but they have a nice covered patio that's perfect when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and it was pretty crowded, which i usually take as a good sign. We were seated right away. The place is not that big so the tables are pretty close to one another so if you like your own space, then maybe you ought to try elsewhere. 

We started out with the Caprese (sp) and it was AMAZING! their pesto sauce has so much flavor and i LOOOOVED their cheese!! Then we got some wings and their wings ar so meaty and delicious. Im not a big fan of chicken and i usually like mt wings burnt to the bone so i dont taste the flavor (weird, i know) but their wings were pretty great. AND that freaking hot sauce they have is not really hot BUT IT IS BY THE FAR THE MOST DELICIOUS sauce i have had...EVER! I'd go back just for that if everything else sucked. 

Then, my boyfriend got the shrimp pizza (shrimp on pizza!?) and I got the chicken pesto. I didnt like either of them. shrimp is just not meant to go on pizza. it doesnt mesh well and their was a sweet kick to it, which my taste buds were just not feeling. The chicken peso was TOO chickeny! it had wayyyyyyyy too much chicken. but the crisped onions on top were delish! 

Our waiter, i wish i could remember his name, but he was an older gentleman with glasses and he was so great! I will be requesting him every time i go there again. 

Overall, I was very happy with this place. I'll just have to try different pizza's next time"}
{"text":"There are so many positive components to tonight's experience. As my husband notes, the service was excellent, the appetizer came within five minutes, our beers were poured perfectly, the prosciutto & fig pizza was delicious, absolutely scrumptious! I put it in my calendar phone that HH is 3-6pm daily and Tuesdays is half off pizza day."}
{"text":"This is by far my new favorite pizza place. Goat cheese pizza is the bomb and meatball appetizer is the perfect share. We may come back for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I've been a pretty negative judge of the whole fancy pizza craze that is going on everywhere it seems.  ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/cibo-phoenix#hrid:9HmRQcPHTFbqSTWIdTtA7A )
Thank you, Humble, for showing me the error of my ways.

In keeping with my slice boycott, on date night at the Pie, I ordered the sourdough burger with the addition of avocado and bacon. It was seriously good, even earning the place of 6 in my adventures in burgering about AZ.: http://www.higherground4x4.com/forums/showthread.php?4301-Quest-for-the-Best-Burger-in-AZ

The girl though went with the oddest topped pizza she could find, with fig & prosciutto. By the time the night was over I had sampled it, cut my delicious burger in half to save for later, and liberally \"helped her\" finish her pizza into gone status. I was impressed and now I have a hard decision to make next time around on what to order.

Oh, we also got the lemoncello margarita and that was super as well.

Decently priced, amazing food. Left me feeling good about my purchase, less mad at the gods of toppings and sauce, and definitely wanting more."}
{"text":"Located inside the Phoenix airport,  this is a decent choice for food while you wait for your connecting flight. 

It's airport food so it's not the greatest but my margarita pizza was edible and it was relatively fast to get."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my mom, grandma, sister and aunt for Mother's Day. Our server, Bryce was EXCELLENT and he even sang to us at the end of our meal. He was outgoing, made everyone laugh and was very attentive. Our food was great and we will definitely be back soon! Definitely try to strawberry and gorgonzola salad"}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened.  I was very excited since it seemed so \"humbling\".

I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks \"okay\" at best.  Chicken Sandwich was excellent.  The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery!  However, the soup can improve.  They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one!  

The place was loud and popping!  Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines.  Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF?  Though I don't think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE.  

Service was good, I guess.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile.  He didn't do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was.  - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim on for lunch. I had the chicken pesto pizza and the SOP pizza. One is enough for two people to share and be full but why not try more than one! Pizza was fresh and tasty! Which also pairs nicely with their white sangria, which was only $5 on happy hour. I would come back."}
{"text":"The good: Amazing daily happy hours with pepperoni (or cheeese) pizzas for $7, and quite a few appetizers for even less. Beers like Four Peaks Raj run for $3, with some cocktails for $5. Seating is stylish and comfortable, and service is good.

The bad: The fries looked good on paper, looked good in person, but were way too salty. The equally salty aioli didn't help. The pizza was alright...I'm a huge fan of the sauce they use, and the cheese was totally legit. The crust left much to be desired...it was a bit too thick and crunchy toward the edges...not the texture you want from a wood-fired pie. 

The ugly: During normal hours, they charge as much for their specialty pizzas ($15) as some of the valley's most coveted pizza parlors, but are clearly not in the same league. This is a strip mall chain that wants to compete your favorite gourmet/Neapolitan locale, but at least needs better dough to come close. 

It's great for a quick lunch, or some day drinking with your pals, but if you want a sit down pizza place for dinner, you can do better. Much better."}
{"text":"Truly a great experience...  Arrived as they opened and there was already a line forming so I figured they must be doing something right. I was explained the lunch specials and we decided to do the calamari for starters and the S.O.P. for our pizza selection.  Calamari came quickly and it tasted like it was fresh, not over breaded and rubbery like a frozen delivered product from restaurant Supply Company. I was however bummed out when our pizza arrived because it was so small, after our two small slices each albeit great; I flagged the server down to order another pizza.  He humbly apologized because the kitchen made us a lunch size instead of the full size, they made us another and it was perfect too.  The great staff, prices and excellent food will get us coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends last week was thrilled this location was just as good as the others. Seriously folks the best pepperoni pizza anywhere. Best wishes to the HP Greenway staff."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! I got the mushroom and it was very delicious! Service was great as well! They have a fantastic happy hour! The skinny size 0 cocktail is very refreshing! There chocolate chip cookie pizza is the best! I defiantly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy every visit here! There is never a long wait, very friendly and pleasant service, great pizza and food in general, and their house special drinks are delicious! If Ian is on the bar, your drinks are guaranteed to be a treat!  Very nice venue to watch a game or meet with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon and decided to check it out for Happy Hour. We loved the place! We had a great server, Jordyn, who even made the visit more pleasurable. She was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. We took her advice on our choices and it was delicious. For appetizers we had the Bruschetta (two kinds), the tomato, mozzarella, basil,and the apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave nectar. They were both heavenly. For our pizza we had the Buffalo Chicken, very good. For our drinks we had the jalape√±o infused Bloody Mary's. They were the best Bloody Mary's I have ever had. They come with fresh basil and mozzarella cheese on top. Everything tastes so fresh, we loved all the unique combination of flavors. We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"beyond disappointed.  I have been here several times and always had good experience but this last time was so bad it outweighed all the positive experience.  Our waiter Ryan could pnot have been more bothered to be working. We waited forever for our pizza despite sitting on the kitchen bar.  He never checked on us.  Pizza was so soggy it was dripping, when we complained he stared at us like we were speaking in tongue.  We asked for new pizza and got the same thing and when we complained again he said \"that is how our pizza is, just let it sit and it will be better\"  Right, as if my soggy pizza with become crisper by sitting.  Not sure if I will go back but for sure not to this location.  I will say that the butternut squash soup was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"The host was very rude when I walked up although I wasn't expecting amazing service from an airport bar. I asked her a question about the seating situation and she just shrugged her shoulders. She literally didn't say a word. I think her name tag said Della or something starting with a D. Once I sat down my experience here got better. A young lady by the name of Jack greeted me and took my order. She brought me back the wrong beer but quickly offered to fix my order. I'm not one to let drinks go to waste so I didn't make her fix it."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to stop by here on a week night after the rush.  After a day of home searching, with no results, a nice quiet dinner is exactly what we needed.

And that it what we got!

Our waitress quickly greeted us, brought us our sangria and wine, both were tasty and  the price wasn't bad.
She was friendly, and did a great job.

The place was clean, with a warm glow from the pizza oven, it felt like a hug in there.  So nice.  

We started with Bruschetta, it was good.Really the traditional tomato, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic shone, sometimes the original just cant be beat.

We then went on to the margherita pizza, something I had been craving for months since I had seen a picture of it in a Phoenix magazine.  Those beautiful dollops of mozzarella, rather than being drowned in rubber cheese, are the stuff dreams are made of. This pizza did not disappoint.

The other we tried was the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage, again, simple and delicious.  

We really enjoyed our meal here, and will be back."}

{"text":"So I have mixed feelings about this place so I am going to break down my rating.

Friendliness and Service from Waiter: 5 Stars - We didn't have to wait for drinks and the waiter was very friendly the biggest issue was had was someone in our group got the wrong pie but they comped them and it was taken care of immediately so no harm no foul.

Wait time and estimate from host: 1 Star - We were told 30-35 minutes and almost an hour later they literally had to move tables from across the room to put them together to accommodate us. Poor planning on the hostess part.

Decor and Space - 2.5 Stars - The Decor is nice but nothing amazingly fancy. They were jam packed Friday night, they need to think about moving into the suite next door as well. They are in DIRE need of more space.

Food - 5 Stars! My husband had been here before and had brought me a Fig and Prosciutto Pizza. He wouldn't tell me what it was but hey Im adventurous so what the heck. It was one of the best things I had ever put in my mouth! So naturally when I went back here I ordered it again and was not disappointed. It was super salty but ..its Prosciutto and I am ok with that. On top of everything we ordered my 2 year old a Cheese pizza. He usually eats a marginal amount. He ate the whole thing. My husband and I just sat their dumb founded. Apparently...he loved the pizza too!

This is a new location and they are still working out the kinks but I will come back here because it was some darn good eating!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst pizza I have ever eaten. I didn't know it was possible to make a thin crust pizza that was undercooked, it's literally paper thin. The cheese is crap, the pepperoni is cardboard. Inexplicably, this tiny thin crust abomination took about half an hour to make, and was bizarrely overpriced. If I could do less than one star, I would. I guess the only saving grace of this place is that it sells alcohol. Go elsewhere and get a sandwich if you're killing time at the airport."}
{"text":"Everyone in this town, including me has become a self proclaimed  pizza critic.  

Humble Pie, Pizza Bianco, Cibo, and the Parlor are eveolving Phoenix into a serious Pizza city.  

Those who enjoy brick oven pizza this is a must.  And those who just eat delivery pizza must come to grips that Pizza Hut's HQ is not in Italy.  

Food:
The heart of the house is right in the dinning area, a wood fire brick oven. And ladies, were talking real wood here.   They make the pizzas right in front of you, how fun see.
Quick note, they do a great job with non pizza items, and a fun kids menu. 


Service:
this is a pizza joint right,  rule number one for amateurs, don't get antsy pansy because things take time on the weekends, this place gets crowded. Why well probably because Humble Pie has created a popular brand.   

I like personal service, most the time your server takes care of you from start to finish and i like that.  

I think restaurants like Humble Pie have given new life to the 7th St. Phoenix restaurant district.  Im glad to see the 85006 zip code continuously attracting more restaurant owners.  The Phoenix area is building up and keeping growing businesses a shot at success.  

Happy Pizza,
Kevin U."}
{"text":"A cheap & healthy meal at the airport...Spicy Minestrone Soup, just a little over $4.00 (after taxes).  Service was \"ok,\" but we're sort at the mercy of these people being stuck at the airport, right? Thankfully the soup was tasty and filling, so it head me over till my flight."}
{"text":"So let me set the stage. Friday around 6:30, Every restaurant  busy. Humble pie is no exception.  They are known  for some very fresh ingredients with a decent selection of beer. The place is busy although while 15 to 20 people waited for a table, there were 3 or 4 tables that were empty and only needed to be cleaned.  This  system of  having patrons wait while the tales sat dirty continued through our dinner. Upon further observation, the wait staff were responsible for cleaning tables. So I ordered a local IPA. Very cold and hoppy. The appetizer was a caprese   Oddly enough, a bowl arrived with some cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto and a few pieces of bread.  This do it your self bowl of ingredients didn't look very appetizing and was reminiscent of leftovers discovered in the back of a refrigerator. Not too worry, the pizza arrived in due time and was awesome. In closing, the service is hit or miss, the caprese is a do it yourself science experiment and yes, the Pizza is worth the wait . Oh, and a shout out to Kendra our waitress, When you say \"God bless you\" to every table, it's kinda presumptuous."}
{"text":"In short go somewhere else. The prices are too high for what you recieve. The bruschetta was $8, Tiny,and hardly an appetizer. The apletizers came out after our food arrived.  Everyone's main meal arrived at different times which was awkward. They messed up half my bruschetta order and instead of just bringing me the correct order they took half of it off my plate and said oh this is probably for somebody else. Like who gives someone food that was on someone else's plate?? Service was painfully slow even though the place was barren. Also they should update their menu, the strawberry salad had toasted penans on it, not candied, really changes the flavor of the dish."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time and had the sausage pizza. Yum!  One of the best pizzas I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Food is 0 star
Alcohol 2-3 stars
Service 3-4 stars

**This was the only restaurant with bar at the C terminal - everything around was a nice walk down the long hall... I really enjoyed their angry monkey - whiskey and angry orchard apple beer... I was looking forward to the pizza and asked the server for his recommendation. He recommended the SOP - Sausage - Red bell peppers - caramelized onions. Pizza came out very timely - only problem was it was SOGGY - either their batter for the crust was crappy or very undercook. IT was so disgusting - I couldn't eat it - it was like cheesy globby casserole. The service saw my dissatisfaction and offered to bring me another as pizza IS NOT suppose to be soggy - they had another one that just came up the window... 
I got my second pizza and it was still soggy - not as soggy as the first, I tried to salvage it by putting napkins bw the crust and the pizza - but the crust was non existent and everything just fell apart. I lost my appetite by then - the manager was nice enough to come by and apologize - I didn't want them to make me another as I had a flight to catch and I just picked off the sausage. 
What a disappointed though. I will not be returning. You only have specialty to make which is pizza and this place missed the mark..."}
{"text":"Never been to a restaurant before that brought out the food for half the table and 10 minutes later brought out the food for the remaining guests.  Humble Pie was capable of doing this with pizza and macaroni and cheese.  Not worth the over priced meal."}
{"text":"I am not one who eats a lot of pizza so take my review lightly, we typically eat Dominos pizza. :)
The only thing that may be considered neg. is that it is a bit pricey. I sent my hubby to pick up our order and when he came back to our vacation rental he said,\" $30 bucks for 2 small pizzas!?!\"
However, we were pleasantly surprised when we tried them. We ordered a meat lovers for us and a pepperoni for the kids. The meat pizza had great quality of meat, not the typical fatty sausage and low quality bacon.  The kids weren't a huge fan, but hey, their favorite foods are Kraft Mac n Cheese and hot dogs!
Overall, great quality pizza for a bit higher price."}
{"text":"Been here 5-6 times. It's overrated. Good crust and decent Caesar Salad, but poor service from too-good-to-help employees makes it not worth my while..."}
{"text":"I have been to Humble Pie multiple times and I have enjoyed it each time. If you go with only 2 people I would suggest splitting a large salad and a pizza. I enjoyed the caesar salad, one of the better caesar salads I have had when dining out. The pizzas are not very big, but they are very tasty. Excellent crust and and a very interesting selection of pies to choose from. 

The service has been quick every time, never a problem with waiting for a table or waiting for food. The drinks, such as their bellini, are also a reason to go. I plan on going again to try some of their other unique pizza options."}
{"text":"This place.... Omgggg love it. Pizza is awesome. Mozzarella bites... Awesome! Veggie salad awesome! Our waiter was really cool and we took his suggestion on a lot of what we ordered. It all turned out great!"}
{"text":"Here's a good tip when ordering your pizza and you like cheese \"on it\" order a cheese pizza and then have them put your toppings on. Not sure why there pizzas are priced $12 to $15 when the are very skimpy on the cheese and toppings and as big as a small at a normal pizza place. I think there pizzas should be price like there happy hour prices. So if your looking for a overpriced pizza and you like to waste your money humble pie is your best bet. I go here often and normally go during happy hour so this will be the norm from now."}
{"text":"Stopped in before we walked the Aquarium. (March of 2018) We were seated and greeted right away. We were served in a very timely manner and the manger as well as our waitress were very attentive to our needs.(drink refills & napkins) The food came out timely and it was very good. They even met some special menu requests we had without any issues. Our experience was very pleasant and I would return to this place again if at the Aquarium. One last thumbs up to the manager that day who was very attentive to all the tables and the restaurant in general, good job."}
{"text":"I was pleased today to see that this place served breakfast and not just pizza!  I've been here several times in the past, but I've just gotten drinks.  I got to the airport pretty early before my flight and was really hungry.  The veggie omelette that I had was delicious!  It also came with fruit, potatoes and toast.

It's too bad they don't have more seating here, as it's always jam packed (in the evenings).  There were plenty of seats available this morning during the breakfast hour.  The service is good, but the wait for my food this morning felt like a very long time.  That could have possibly been that I was looking at my watch more than usual, as I was keeping an eye on my flight.

I'll be back here whether it's for breakfast, lunch, happy hour or dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after church on Sunday with a friend who is a regular. I ordered the lunch special. I had the chopped salad and BBQ pizza. The salad was DELICIOUS and warrants a return trip. The BBQ pizza was also very good, piping hot and prepared upon order. The service was quick and efficient. The wait time for the arrival of our food was minimal. Our server was superb and friendly. Definitely returning and bringing a friend or two with me..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Customer service is fantastic, food and beverages are always great. The atmosphere is either family or just socialize. I highly recommend grabbing a bite to eat and a drink there ."}
{"text":"I wasnt sold on Humble Pie the first time I came in, but im sold now. Their meatballs are delicious. Great lunch special and friendly folks. And I love the staff (love my two favorite servers Rizzo and Theron). They always crack me up. A great place to hang out and grab an iced tea."}
{"text":"Delicious salads and made from scratch pizza.  Excellent wait staff.  Prices are reasonable.   Rather small menu, but quite adequate.   Good parking at this location.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We tried this out last night. We won't be back. 

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck. 

Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Had good seating, breakfast meal of eggs and sausage wrap is outstanding!  If you have a long layover, proceed to Terminal 4 through the connected skyways and enjoy!  Nice ambience!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but I go for the pizza cookie!  Warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie a la mode. SOOOO good."}
{"text":"I visited as part of a group of about 25 people seated on the patio. We had a single server, and he did an admirable job considering our numbers. I ordered a blue margarita and it came out quickly--and wow, it had a lovely alcoholic punch. My main meal was the small size strawberry and spinach salad with added chicken. The size was perfect, and I was really pleased with the amount of chicken and the perfect way it was cooked; it wasn't too dry, a common problem with chicken for salads. My one criticism is that I wished it had more gorgonzola cheese.

I appreciated how our server handled a situation at our table, too. One of my companions had a fly land in his drink and drown. Our server insisted on removing the drink from his bill, even as my friend said he was fine with paying for it--it was hardly the restaurant's fault that a fly landed there. In the end, though, the drink was not on his bill. I thought the whole exchange was done in a very classy way by both parties.

I wouldn't mind visiting this or other Humble Pie locations, as I was very impressed with my experience here."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday and were the second customers in the small restaurant. The servers we spoke with were very nice, though service itself was surprisingly slow considering how few folks were dining. We never did get water refills and had a 15 minute wait to get our check, and had to flag someone down.

I ordered the lunch express with a veggie salad, and fig and prosciutto pizza. The salad was okay; it was a bit heavy on beans, so that flavor dominated. I liked the crust of the pizza. The toppings were tasty though the fig jam was in very heavy dollops. I really liked how the fig flavor worked with the prosciutto and goat cheese.

My husband had the lunch express with the Caesar salad and meat lovers pizza. He found both to be okay, but they didn't strike him as standing out in a \"wow\" kind of way.

Really, the lunch express is a very good buy. The pizzas were okay but we wouldn't go out of our way to come here again. There are a few other pizza places around with a lot more oomph and more attentive service as well."}
{"text":"At another recent trip to Humble Pie after work with friends, I was introduced to a slightly off-menu item that has to be tried to be appreciated. Order the Garlic & Potato pizza and then ask them to include Pancetta as a topping. The combination of all of the flavors really works together: the bacon-y goodness of the pancetta, the herbal notes from the rosemary-seasoned potatoes, the rich roasted garlic and pungent Gorgonzola. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3 star rating because it isn't good enough to deserve 4 and not so bad that I'd give it a two. 

My wife and I will stop in on a Thursday night to get the \"Date Night\" special. An appetizer, two small salads and a pizza for $20. Great deal for a thrifty couple. Any other night would be too much of a strain on the pocketbook as items tend to be a little pricey. 

Yeah the wait can be long, service is slow and they pack too many people in a small space. The outdoor patio is nice during the right time of year and there has been decent live entertainment at the bar. Wait staff can be a bit odd but not enough to bother me. 

One night they ran out of mozzarella for the appetizer. I know, a pizza place ran out of mozzarella right? They didn't tell us until way too late but made up for it with a free dessert. 

Bottom line, I will go back for the special but not much else."}
{"text":"Seriously don't waste your money here.  Look at the portion size here... $10.99 for a dinky wrap, a piddly amount of potatoes and 4 grapes 1 cantaloupe 1 melon bite.  Way over price, slow service.  Not worth your time or money"}
{"text":"I had previously visited the humble pie in Scottsdale a few years ago and was slightly underwhelmed, so I was not making a mad rush to try the new location in Phx.  I did purchase a groupon and on a lazy Sunday night the bf and I decided to head over for pizza.  We were seated immediately, the service was excellent, attentive, and very courteous.  We started with the green beans which were fantastic!  Perfectly seasoned, crispy, and a nice dipping sauce.  We then got two different pizzas, one with the schreiner's sausage, one marg with goat cheese added.  Both were fantastic, the crust was perfectly crisp on the outside, nice and chewy on the inside.  I had just visited parlor the week before and I could not say the same for the pizza crust there sadly.  We had a few glasses of wine, and with the groupon deal it was totally reasonable and I would return for sure!  They have live music on the patio Saturday nights also."}
{"text":"Ambiance is GREAT! 
Food also Great! 
Happy Hour ok.... But definitely a fun place to be when your with a small group of people looking for a good slice of pie. Service is very friendly- a must go again place!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and had the pizza. Today my friend & I decided to try the sandwiches. Very disappointing! I had the Roast Beef & my friend had the Turkey. Both were lackluster and smothered with slimy roasted red peppers. If you go to Humble Pie, go for the pizza (and the Happy Hour!)"}
{"text":"Great place for wood-fired pizza! I had heard some great things about Humble Pie and I wanted to finally try it out. Came for for the lunch special which is a 10 inch pizza and a soup or salad. I opted for the Meat lovers pizza with artichoke which was pretty good and overall satisfying. 

Server was very kind but it seemed they may have been understaffed as he was the only server working at the time. 

Not a bad price for the lunch special and the 10 inch pizza along with the soup was more than enough to be filling. 

Not my favorite pizza joint, but would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow! My first and last time at this location. We came in for happy hour and ended up with a $100+ bill, with only 1 item billed correctly. The manager then came over and argued with us for 10 minutes. He left, then came back to argue some more. A 1/2 salad was $8.95, and it was approximately 4 oz. in a small bowl. Will be stopping to eat on the way home."}
{"text":"The pizza is always a hit plus they have a decent selection of other items on the menu if you're not into pizza. The staff is always pretty friendly and helpful.   Sorry to see they  don't have live music on the patio anymore.   About the only negative is the wine pours always seem to be pretty small."}
{"text":"The food is alright but not worth the ride wait staff. Twice as I have walked into the restaurant the staff has made gestures and faces that imply they are displeased with having to serve someone. I m sorry the staff does not enjoy doing their jobs but that reason to make a customer feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not great. And expensive, too, for my taste.
But, I went there with a group for lunch and wasn't sure what to expect.
The pizzas are not pies at all, but rather small and on a thin crispy crust.
From azcentral: \"The 10 pizzas ($10-$12) are personal size, about 10 inches. They range from the simple Margherita (tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil) and pepperoni to more fanciful pies topped with wild mushrooms, pancetta, red onion and mozzarella or prosciutto, pears, arugula and gorgonzola.\"
Again, it was good, but not great. I would imagine that one of these pizzas and a good glass of wine, which they have a large selection of, would make for a nice evening of food, wine and conversation."}
{"text":"Fernando was our waiter and he was the BEST!  We were a group of 6 and in a time crunch and he accommodated us so well that we actually had enough time to enjoy our lunch!  Oh, and the food was Deelish!"}
{"text":"This is for sure the better location of humble pie. The wings and pizza were very good and the place was spotless. The food tasted fresh and well put together. Id be back again. I usually visit the arrowhead location and now I know this place can be amazing I'll stick with this one!!"}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE IF YOU ARE CELIAC. Just ate at the location at the Aquarium. Chose it because they had gluten free pizza crust. Which of course you pay $3 extra for. Would not mind that if I actually was given a GF pizza. I chose the chicken pizza. It comes with a coating that I thought was gf because, hey it's chicken on a GF pizza. Nope!! 
Chicken coating contained wheat flour. Plus gf friendly butter and Parmesan. I asked server what the coating was. She didn't know, so asked cook. Cook acknowledged flour in the coating on those wee chicken pieces. Seriously?? When person pays extra for GF crust, don't you think you should let them know the chicken is coated with non gluten free flour. Clearly staff don't have a clue about what eating gluten free is. Or how we Celiacs do damage to our bodies when we ingest gluten. Please educate yourselves."}
{"text":"Watch your receipts then tend to pad their tips. We order something small and because of that we left a 30% tip. Apparently that wasn't enough. That's not the worst part. When we called the management they were appalled we wanted the extra tip back. They thought it was crazy we were asking for it. You do realize that if he's adding to us he's probably adding to others as well?
Food was fine, as was the service, but......"}
{"text":"The new Humble Pie at Happy Valley Road & 39th Ave is great; I love the patio.  Food was awesome, services was great and prices are reasonable.  I had the express lunch for $10 that included a salad and pizza.  Hummmmmmmmmmmmy!"}
{"text":"This is a great urban restaurant that offers pizza, pasta, sandwiches and burgers... I had the $9.99 lunch special that included a pizza and bowl of soup (they let you pick any kind of pizza you want for no extra charge... so I got the meatball pizza - YUMMY). Both were great ; the only down side was a 10 minute wait to get a table.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered a meat lovers pizza and an order of fried mozzarella for pickup through Grub Hub. I got the text saying that my food was ready, so I headed over to the restaurant to pick it up. I just moved here from Louisiana, and I can say that this place reminded me of New Orleans, but not in a good way. The restaurant smelled like Bourbon Street, in the fact that it smelled like stale beer and vomit. Not a great first impression. Then, the staff were very friendly, which was the only redeeming quality of this whole visit. It took about 10 minutes to figure out where my food was, and by the time I was handed my food, it was completely cold. I got home to pizza that had cheese so cold that it had congealed on the pizza. The crust is so thin that it doesn't hold anything on it, especially toppings like meatballs. The fried mozzarella tasted good, but it was too cold to really enjoy. This has definitely been one of the worst experiences I have ever had since I moved here. I will most certainly NOT be back."}
{"text":"I never write reviews...ever. This place is awesome. I have had a few different servers everytime I go, and they are all awesome. Super nice and informative and they actually seem like that give a crap about your experience and meal. On to the pizza..my favorite place out here is Grimaldis and this place does better than them. I love the meat lovers pizza with the sausage and pepperoni and who can forget the pancetta. For an appetizer I never pass on the red pepper flakes parm fries! hell yes! 
Great specials for happy hour and Thursday night is date night! Awesome awesome place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were super lucky,  we had a few hours for our layover,  so we decided to get grub.  She opted for Pei Wei, but I decided to try out the sweet aroma of pizza.  I asked the hostess what she liked,  she recommended the simple pepperoni for me.  15 minutes later,  my order was called. The cook was really nice,  he informed me about what the operations of the pizza,  asked me how I wanted my pizza sliced,  and recommended I eat it with ranch,  which I've never done before. It was good!  The service was friendly, my friend and I really enjoyed it.  Like Caesar's pizza, it was hot,  fresh, and ready!  If you have time,  try it!"}
{"text":"The best pizza and food and Caesar salad(real)Amazing and fresh, vegetables, tomatoes and Mozzarella great!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Is such a friendly environment. It's perfect for central Phoenix the pizza oven is right in the middle of the restaurant and it's so much a part of the process of being here. I love sitting at the bar because it's so much more friendly. We had a wonderful all meat pizza and half-price wine night on Monday. I love coming here for happy hour and having Aimee serve me! Updated December 21, 2017 I came tonight with my daughter Sara. She is gluten intolerant as well as unable to eat any type of dairy products. The wonderful staff here made sure that our meal was perfect. We were able to get a gluten-free pizza even though I had gotten a free pizza coupon. They made sure that they only put the cheese on my side of the pizza. Plus we ordered the veggie salad, which was excellent. They also separated that into two portions and put the cheese only on mine. Hannah and the staff here are so wonderful. Come and try it out"}
{"text":"Do not order anything for pick up from this place!  They took my order and then when I arrived to pick it up, they claimed to have never gotten it.  They said I must have called the other location-but I didn't.  They told me it would take 15 minutes so I agreed to wait.  It took 30!  They did not comp anything or even apologize.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Let's be fair shall we?

Sometimes the difference between an average pizza and an outstanding pizza is in the way it is ordered and if the pizza maker follows those instructions.

Humble Pie at Sky Harbor Airport delivered a perfect Pepperoni Pizza!

I ordered it \"Crispy, well done, almost burnt\"

PERFECTION! Totally tasty waves!"}
{"text":"We went to HP because both couples had Groupon and upon ordering, informed the waiter of the Groupon situation and if it was OK?  He replied it was good but  he would have to give us separate checks to honor the Groupon and everyone was in agreement.  At the end of the meal the waiter said \"Oops,\" the manager said they could not honor the second Groupon because we were at the same table.  I asked to speak to the \"Manager.\" and that individual informed us the waiter made a mistake and only one Groupon would be honored. This \"Manager,\" was out of his element in dealing with customers and I had the feeling he was just filling in.  The thing that made the situation even worse was after writing twice to the Humble Pie Headquarters to tell of our experience...there was no response.  Mind you I am not looking for a free lunch but was only pointing out our negative experience in hopes it would not happen to others but it fell on humble but deaf ears.  No one cares what happens here and we do not care to return."}
{"text":"Pizza at the airport.... I can't be good.... Guess again!   PHX is quickly becoming my favorite layover airport.  Considering just a few years ago it was on of the worst.  

The pizza had a nice thin crust.  The cheese and sauce was perfect.  @ $14 for a individual pizza and a drink it is a good airport value.  

It was so good I am checking my return flight for Friday to see if I have enough time to hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Humble Pie three times now. The first time was take out pizza, and I was helped promptly upon arriving at the restaurant. I was not very impressed with the pizza, although I came back to dine in to give it another chance. My boyfriend and I ate at the bar. I enjoyed the toasted ravioli appetizer, and the Schreiner's Italian Sausage was average. There are so many other pizza places in the area that make a better pizza with high quality ingredients. My third visit; however, was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.

I went in on a Friday after work for happy hour with 6 co-workers. All but one drink came out in a timely manner, although 3 waters took quite some time. Our food arrived and we were missing one appetizer and two pizzas. I spoke to our server to inform him we were missing some items, including the water and drink. He said we only ordered one of the two missing pizzas and I assured him we had ordered two. Everything except the second pizza arrived. When we asked for it, our server's comment hinted at disbelief as if we ate it and lied! At the end of dinner, we still had not received the pizza. We ordered 2 to go orders and one dessert. The to go orders came out in regular dishes, we asked for them to go and asked for the dessert and the elusive pizza. We received the to go dinners, but no pizza or dessert. When one person asked for the check, our server made a comment in a rude tone about how she probably wants to pay for her portion out of all 7 and asked if she knew what she ordered. At that point we asked a food runner for a manager and our server was brought over. We insisted to talk to a manager. The manager finally came to our table, apologized profusely, took off the pizza and dessert from our bill, and made sure we had all items requested. He also was kind enough to give us coupons for a free pizza when we spend a minimum of $20!"}
{"text":"I always love hoping to humble pie.

The brushwork is awesome, the garlic fries are great.

I HIGHLY recommend the roasted mushroom pizza. Service is always great and the price is good

This is a goto place for me when in phx"}
{"text":"Searched for a place with good happy hour deals and food and this one was in more than a couple \"Best lists.\" Met a friend there on a Thursday and was surprised to find such good deals on drinks and their \"date night\" deal for $20 is awesome! The day we were there we had the idea of going outside to enjoy the cooler weather, unfortunately, so were a bunch of mosquitoes! If it weren't for the multiple bites we both got, I think I would have rated this cute place a 5/5. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I've never been impressed by their pizza. So, this time I ordered the strawberry Gorgonzola salad. The salad was swimming in dressing so much that I couldn't eat it. The entire bottom half of the bowl was dressing. Gross. The salad leaves were also very wilted and looked as though they were turning. Don't go here. It's gross."}
{"text":"I loathe pulling up a chair at the bar and sitting... waiting... then having to ask for service, even though we had eye contact all the while she was doing side work.

Also not too keen on having to grab the bar rag myself, to wipe up the previous diners' crusty mess.

The food could knock my socks off but that won't matter once the tone is set.

Again one of those situations where a highly rated brick and mortar location is beholden to the poor service of an airport contracted company.

Btw. The meatballs (three meatballs & bread) were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Food was quick - 10 mins - their special sausage pizza was off the chart!  Great airport eatery and not badly priced!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years..the food is pretty good but the service is always eh, just ok. The last visit was trrrible. Our server went on a 5 minute tangent about how the company has lost millions of dollars in their promotional deals last year and that they are really starting to buckle down and watch what promotions are going on, etc. We were there for happy hour and it also happened to be kids eat free day. We ordered off the regular menu too. She said we couldn't do kids eat free since we ordered some stuff off the happy hour menu..seriously?! My 2 yr old had mac and cheese out of a box, that I'm sure cost them a whole 25 cents to prepare. Terrible customer service, it was really uncomfortable & we won't be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to go to this restaurant for an early lunch, and right when we walked into the spot we were greeted immediately.  James Brown was playing in the background, I thought that was awesome, we had the choice of sitting at the bar or at a table. So we chose the bar and the bar has a very old school feel to it.  With wine bottles lined up on top of each other and what seemed to be a full bar of different alcohols.  We got mimosas and they use a presecco champagne that we were fond of.

Once we ordered our pizza and soup combo, the soup came out surprisingly fast and was very tasty. The minestrone with sausage. I ordered the parmesean chicken pizza and my mom got the artichoke pizza both very delicious and served fast. Nothing was necessarily mind blowing, but it was a nice first experience and very chill place to have lunch."}
{"text":"This is a really good Italian food restaurant... Good service... Good food... Nice ambience... I like it better than CPK as Pizza is not dry here.... Worth a try....fries are good .. Personal favorite is grilled chicken pesto pizza...."}
{"text":"I first became a fan of Humble Pie when a friend of mine would come over on a weekly basis and bring take out from the Humble Pie on Tatum, yes Humble Pie's pizza to go is what originally got me hooked. I think that goes pretty far considering all the toppings that can easily perish on a hot pizza during a car ride. But it was and always had been great! 
Last week I finally got the chance to actually go into a Humble Pie, this time Scottsdale one, and was once again very pleased with the results. 
A friend and I went on a Thursday evening I think around 730/ 8 pm or so and it was a little busy, but we didn't have to wait at all for a table. 
I really liked the atmosphere there, low lit, patio seating and even seating where you can watch the guys make your pizza, (how fun!) M y only gripe on seating was that I did feel a little close to the table beside us, as far as conversations and things, but for those that don't really mind \"family style\" seating (although thats not quite what they got going on, the tables are still really close) wont mind it at all. 
Beer on tap? Check. And some really good ones. There is nothing a enjoy more than being able to enjoy a local (AZ) brew. The wine list looked good as well. 
some may think... gourmet pizza? Well fear not if you have a picky or 'I like the simple things in life\" type eater, they can make some really really great pepperoni pizza as well. As for me, I prefer the prosciutto, pear and Gorgonzola cheese pizza with arugula. Wow. i always want to try one of their other creations, but usually end up with that one. I cant imagine ANY of their pizzas not being pretty darn good. 
Service was good. The servers looked like they liked their job and were friendly. 
Word on the street was that Humble Pie has been trying to portray themselves as an \"adult\" pizzeria. And I could see that and I personally like the idea. There were children in there at the time I was and of course Humble Pie is very accommodating to them and all families, I just think they like more of the adult scene. 
So to sum things up, I really like Humble Pie, it was a nice meal, not too pricey, great to take a date, but I'm curious to check out the one on Tatum to see how the vibe there is."}
{"text":"We came in yesterday around lunchtime with a party of 11. Our wait time was minimal and everyone working was happy and energetic. The pizza was delicious and our service was excellent. Our waitress was a tall, young, thin brunette. She was exceptional. Our drinks stayed full and everything came out promptly. The only things that could've improved was the pizza could've been hotter (temperature) seemed like they might not have all been finished at the same time so they weren't hot, but they weren't cold either so it was ok. The music in the bathroom was oddly loud which was a minor irritant only because I had to change my babies diaper in there. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Every one of these stars was for the food. My husband and I joined 4 other couples for dinner on a Thursday night. They had a special and so we took advantage of the special and ordered Calamari, 2 salad and one small pizza to share, and we added in a bottle of wine, and everything was delicious. The Calamari was GREAT!  The wine was really good. And we had a very meaty meat loving pizza.  Yum.

No one had been to this restaurant before, it's still relatively new, so we were all delighted to find it was nicely air conditioned for summer dining and the space (while tight) was comfortable.  

Our waitress was really nice, and very attentive. I was even more amazed when the cook came out to apologize to another couple for delivering their ravioli slightly frozen.  He brought out new ravioli and apologized personally for the issue.  What service! 

Then it was time to settle up and leave and things got a little uncomfortable. Our host for the evening had a \"Groupon\" coupon.  He wanted to use that coupon and was denied because their bill (which had been done individually) was priced out at the \"special\" pricing.  Okay, so they didn't read the fine print, but the manager came by to explain that they couldn't see fit to use this coupon under any condition (not even the condition that the owner of the coupon brought in 8 other diners for a \"big party\" where they had put mandatory service charges on the bill.)

I get that a restaurant has to have rules for coupons and other specials, but they also have to take into consideration how uncomfortable this was for our host and how he really wanted to show off this cool place to his friends. 

That was such a sad ending to a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"We came for the pizza, but there are also salads and pasta dishes on the menu. Our pizzas were delicious! I tried the BBQ Chicken and my BF got the Meatlovers. We also tried the Fried Mozzarella, which is delicately fried fresh mozzarella. Yum! 
I'm giving four stars because it was a loud atmosphere during the dinner rush, and the waitress gave my BF the wrong drink."}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty good. While this is located in an airport and thus has airport prices, I have been enjoying my pizza. I have never been to a Humble Pie restaurant so I can't compare it to that. However here is my review of the food. 

I purchased a 12 inch marguerita pizza and a 20 oz soda for 13 bucks, which is higher than normal but not a bad price for airport food. The pizza itself is decent. Not as great as CPK but decent and much better than the stuff you get from the large chains like Pizza Hut in my opinion. The crust is standard fare. It has flavor on it. The sauce on the other hand is a bit too herby and bitter for me. The cheese however is very good and tasted fresh. My only problem with the cheese is that it was not distributed evenly to the crust. It seemed as if someone just plopped cheese in the middle of the pie and hoped for the best. As far as service goes, the pizza arrived quickly despite there being a long line. The customer service was also good because the person who made my pizza cooked it too long and asked me if I wanted him to make a new one. 

All things considered I would consider visiting this restaurant on your next layover. While I probably wouldn't go to this place outside of the airport. I must say I am impressed with this place for what it is. Normally I would give it 3 stars for the food alone if that's your deal."}
{"text":"Great place, great service and great deals.  The lunch special is a deal and a half.  Salad and pizza under 11.00. You can choose any of the salads and one pizza off the two pages of pizza they have... NICE!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza with amazing garlic french fries. I discovered this place off of Groupon where you can get 10$ deal worth 20$. It's totally worth it if you catch it on Groupon. I do recommend this place especially the location in central Phoenix! Very cool environment"}
{"text":"Very well done Humble Pie!

I had dinner here on Wednesday night and absolutely loved it. The salads are perfect, and the pizza is just incredible - wood fired with a lot of unique toppings (potato, clams, etc.). The pizzas are the perfect size for two to share, and leave you just enough room to try their eclectic appetizers.

Beautiful atmosphere at night. I'm not sure how other reviewers are calling it casual? I haven't heard of too many 5-star pizzerias - this is about as nice as they come... It's definitely a pizzeria and wine bar, with lots of wine to choose from, and really a nice bar area for happy hour.

They also have a climate controlled patio which is gonna pay off in the summer. The chairs and stools may be the most comfortable my bum has landed on.

It's not the BEST pizza I have ever had - but it's damn close, and it's also damn close to my house :)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and cooked fresh. The center is in is really cute and probably fun when there's live music playing. The waitress was insanely obnoxious. She spoke very condescendingly, was frequently talking to another employee in a way that you could tell she was bad mouthing customers, she wasn't at all genuinely friendly or helpful. Unfortunately, staff like means I'll be eating at a different spot in this cool little center next time."}
{"text":"thursday nights is date night: 1 app, 2 sm salads, 1 pizza for $20.  it was a great deal.  the app we ordered was the calamari and it was good with the pesto sauce.  i ordered the veggie salad which had green beans, cheese and a lite vinegar dressing.  loved it!  the pizza was a thin crust and we got the sausage.   will go back!"}
{"text":"This is a VERY VERY average restaurant. 

They should be humble as their pies pretty much suck. Gourmet?  No way.

I have been here a number of occasions as it is 1 block from my office. The Pizza, which should be the star of the show, has always disappointed on the 3-4 times we have been here.

Crust does not have any depth, they are generally not cooked long enough, and  I would rate the pizza here about a solid 5 on a good day. 

If you are seeking this type of a chain restaurant, then a visit to any of the many Grimaldi's locations would be a much wiser choice - the pies at Grimaldi's are a solid 8+, with a crust which blows Humble Pie out of the water.

I never understood why Humble Pie has stayed in business as their Pizza is just meh. Not only are they staying in business but the owners are aggressively trying to expand through the valley. Well all the luck guys as your food needs a vast improvement. The soggy, bland crusts here(I predict)  won't stand the test of time.

This chain seems to cater to the Yuppie/kiddie \"California Pizza Kitchen\" crowd who may be seeking a happy hour or tasteless food, and may not be as picky about food quality. Cool with me I guess. But please don't call this very average place anything more than what it is. 

Ambiance? I don't care - there are many restaurants in Phoenix which look like Humble Pie with the typical bar and pseudo pizza oven.

Humble Pie is a \"flash in the pizza pan\" operation. Avoid."}
{"text":"We had it in our heads to have a BLT for lunch but lacking everything it took to make a BLT so we decided to go out. Went to Humble Pie. As usual the waitstaff there seemed rushed and slightly under staffed. When are BLTs came we found the bacon burned. These BLTs are light on the L light on the T and heavy on the burned B.
I can't say I'd recommend going there for lunch unless you had lots of time."}
{"text":"Love their pizza crust. Pepperoni is thick and tasty. If you're in the middle for a different type of pie, try this place. Oh and kids eat free on Sunday's! The biggest portion on the kids menu is the pizza. The rest is for younger kids."}
{"text":"My partner REALLY likes the Rock Shrimp appetizer at Humble Pie so when I saw the Groupon I was in!

Me, I'm not so keen on Humble Pie. Don't get me wrong, I like most of the food and today our service was great. Their prices are just too high if you're just walking in the door to order off the menu. Express lunches are okay as is Happy Hour. 

Just make sure you're getting some kind of deal otherwise you'll need to take out a second mortgage to pay the bill."}
{"text":"I had seen groupons for this place but none of my friends I asked had tried it so I got the opportunity to go tonight. This place had some really good pizza. I loved the rustic atmosphere. Casual dining at it best. I also had tempura green beans in an aoli dipping sauce that was really good. It was a bit pricey was my only complaint."}
{"text":"Luckily we had a Groupon otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.

If you say the chicken you're putting on the pizza is grilled then grill it for gosh sakes. Don't give me some freezer burned, dirty tasting shredded chicken with dab of pesto sauce on it. Yuck.

My partner had the spaghetti and meatballs which was okay, but came with one lonely slice of bread. Can't they splurge and be a little more generous with the bread? Especially for almost $40 bucks. 

For $36 plus tip you get a pizza, Spaghetti and Meatballs, an Iced Tea and one glass of wine. The Safeway store brand frozen pizza is better than this.

Why I came here twice is beyond me. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"I had a 2 hr layover at Phx, was hungry and trying to find something vegetarian! The cheese pizza at Humble Pie came to my rescue, and how!! Simple and fresh. I really did love the herbs. Friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is an absolute disaster. I recently visited this location after a bad experience a year ago. Today, after waiting an hour and twenty minutes for our food, we just had to leave.   Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice. . . Yelp."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My fianc√© ordered the calrese sandwich which is a veggie item. She loved it! It also came with a side salad. I ordered the meat lover's pizza and it was good. It came with pepperoni, sausage and pancetta. Pancetta had a weird taste and I'm sure that's the natural cooked flavor, not a Humble Pie issue. Will definitely come back, especially since my girl really enjoyed her caprese sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious strawberry  gorgon zola salad!  And we like the Thursday night date night specials. Pizza is good and hot..the small is enough for two. Be aware that it is a popular place for families,  so the restaurant can be quite noisy."}
{"text":"This was a great place. Stopped in just to try out the happy hour, and it's the best I've been to in  the phoenix area. Four Peaks craft brew on happy hour price for $2.50. Thumbs up for that. I've been to other places that would charge twice that claiming it's imported, even though it's a local brewery. 

The happy hour food menu wasn't extensive, but there were a few quality key items that rocked. 9\" personal pizza for $6.50, and I think the pizza here is excellent. I also ordered the fries ($4) expecting a small side of fries. What I got was a good sized dish with a mountain of fries covered in parmesan and parsley. It was awesome! There were so many fries I couldn't eat them all and shared with the people next to me at the bar, so they bought me a beer. 

Finally, the staff were so cool and attentive. Caitlyn is a great bartender and very friendly. Plus it was so nice outside, they had the windows open and it just made the night that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and opted for the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad. It was really yummy. I went on a weekday for lunch with a coworker, who got the pizza lunch special with pepperoni, which he enjoyed. Our server was attentive. I have since been told they have a GF pizza crust so on a future visit would like to try it. They have a humongous wine rack on the main wall when you walk in. Overall the visit was pretty good."}
{"text":"Humble Pie delivers great pizza, loved it: chewy crust, great quality toppings, this is pizza at its finest. Highly recommended with good service and at fair prices, too."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Quick and friendly service. Plus you can't beat the express lunch specials! The Buffalo chicken pizza is the best around!"}
{"text":"Freshly baked pizza while you wait for your flight. It wasn't memorable. But very filling. As one person reviewed, the cheese was fresh. Upside, charging stations are built into some of the bartops."}
{"text":"Please follow along with this review in your best \"late night urban radio DJ/love talk & slow jams host voice\" with imagined Barry White and Teddy Pendergrass songs playing in the background...

The pizzas at Humble Pie are described so attractively on the menu and they're each just enough for two people to share, but maybe a little too much for one person. Especially if you happen to be a ladyyyyyy. Ladies looooove to eat pizza, they just won't eat too much of it in front of most men they're not married to.

Imagine you're with a lovely ladylove of yours, and gently popping roasted olives into her mouth...one by one...hot. 

Damn, she doesn't like olives? How about some tempura-fried green beans that you can tease her lips with, slowly at first, then with increasing intensity until they're all gone? 

Yeahhhh...that's a nice appetizer for your special lady.

The small and dimly lit dining room sets the mood for romance. Your eyes locked onto hers, as you each sip a tall domestic beer, anxiously awaiting the arrival of your main course. The cardboard pizza boxes all around enhance the sexy ambiance.

If your woman is adventurous, she might go for the fig and prosciutto pizza. With goat cheese, it's soooo creamy good. Traditional ladies would probably let you get away with pulling a Margherita on them, because tomato, basil and mozzarella never hurt nobody. You might even have yourself a real freak on your hands who wants that Meat Lovers joint allll night long.

Nevermind the screaming toddlers and the sports on the TVs near the dining room. These dim lights and pizza can only mean one thing. Awwww yeah...it's time to get on down. Mmmm hmmmm.

Ain't gonna be no leftovers tonight. Nuh uh. Y'all are hungry for it and you are gonna finish what you started.

You got some Beano, Tums and Mylanta in your glovebox for later, playa?  

There's no such thing as a bad pizza, but this one was just OK. Don't forget that Thursday night is date night...at Humble Pie..."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!  Never have been here. Atmosphere feels like a cafeteria. Very dark. No table lighting. Oil used for pizza dough tasted rancid. Too expensive for a strip mall.  Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Humble pie is a fantastic restaurant with a wide variety of food for a pizza restaurant. All of the ingredients used are either fresh and organic, or homemade. The crust is addictive, with a bubbly outer edge and thinner middle. The mozzarella, sauce and crust are all homemade. They have amazing specials all day, everyday. Great beer and wine selection too."}
{"text":"The menu for anything but pizza is pretty sparse and entrees are fairly pricey.  They do have a pretty extensive wine menu.

My wife had spaghetti and meatballs; I had a BLT with greens on the side and others in our party ordered a variety of pizzas.  The spaghetti was bland and the meatballs were also bland and spongy.  The BLT was one of the worst I have ever attempted to eat.  I would avoid the sandwiches if you visit.  The pizzas come in one size - 12\" - and they are also pricey.  Most of our party said they were \"OK\" but nothing to write home about.  For a salad, spaghetti dinner, two soft drinks and a BLT sandwich along with a tip the bill was over $50.  I think there are better choices out there and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Had a Groupon. Watched Padres BP on patio, ate great pizza!  Very cool :)"}
{"text":"This little place can be packed at busy times - and the tables are really close together.  Then, it gets HOT and they open the windows to try and get some air moving - which is often no help.  I had this experience twice.  If they have A/C, it must not have been working.

Wife likes the wine selection.  Pizza good but not great.  Pricey.

If you can dine at an off time, when it won't be crowded, I think you may have a four star experience, but the food ain't 5 star IMHO."}
{"text":"I've been to 5th and Wine and loved the ambience.  So, I decided to try out Humble Pie and was greatly fulfilled!! Having studied abroad in Florence, I KNOW GOOD PIZZA!!!!  I know tastes vary from person to person, but in my opinion it was very well done!!!  We ordered the garlic fries and goat cheese roasted red pepper pizza.  Needless to say, NOTHING WAS LEFT ON THE TABLE!!!  I will be going back very soon to try the Pizza Cookie!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch in the airport. Pizza is fresh and tasty. This time I ordered their meatball appetizer with a side Caesar salad. You get three meatballs Ina nice red sauce with two pieces of garlic toast. 

It's always crowded but seats open up fast. You can also get it to go. 
Staff is friendly and I especially like that they carry portable credit card readers so my card never leaves my side. And it's faster. 

This location is next to gate C7 so check it out if you want a tasty bite."}
{"text":"Very good food but the staff is rude. I ordered food from the to go area (which looked like that was the only place you could order from, there was no one else around) and then chose to eat it there while I was waiting for my flight. My table was on the outskirts and it was dead in there. There was not even a hostess to seat you and honestly the set up was weird and confusing. One of the severs came up to me 30 mins after I had been sitting there and asked me if I needed anything. I told her I just ordered from the to go area and decided to just eat it here, she seamed annoyed by that and walked away."}
{"text":"The staff at at humble pie is great! If you have a chance ask for Ginger and Maryann. Though I am suspect that is their real names. Drinks are top notch, ask for the skipper while you are here. He obviously runs the show."}
{"text":"Full bar, four tap beers, 10 inch pizzas speciality, many app selections, burgers and salads.  6 50 inch TVs.
Comfortable seating - slightly above average noise level.  Pizzas were bland in flavor and calamari was mushy after a bit with the lemon and basil sauce."}
{"text":"We like this place, especially the happy hour menu and specials.  They have all day happy hour on the weekends which includes $5 glasses of any wine on the menu, not just the house stuff.  The pizza is thin/crispy style.  It's good pizza, not the best, but it has good crunch.  I find the sauce and cheese to be a bit bland, but it does have a good flavor and toppings can help add to that.  The outdoor seating is a plus, it's a great place to chill on a nice Saturday afternoon to enjoy some drinks and apps.  We like the atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"I love that they offer a drink happy hour from 11-6. We started off with a couple of beers (kiltlifter and summer shandy). Beers were cold and tasty perfect. Much to our surprise they offered an express lunch option even on the weekend which we thought was great! So we both had the express lunch... I had the pizza/salad combo for 9.95 which was a lot of food. I chose the veggie salad, it was awesome. Lots included in the salad (white beans, cheese, avocado, jicama, green beans, lettuce). My pizza selection was the margherita which was simple and great. I love the crust! We also tried the soup/salad combo for 7.95. Soup was butternut squash which was very good and the strawberry Gorgonzola salad which was equally as delicious. Great prices and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Went last night when we realized Rice Paper was closed for repairs. The service was prompt and fairly friendly. We got the pear and prosciutto (I think it was supposed to come with arugula but it had spinach on it - can't quite remember) and the potato with garlic. Both were okay, nothing special or memorable. The proscuitto was suuuper salty and needed more sweetness to cut it. & the potato pies leaks were tough, also it just needed a little something more, not sure what. We both agreed we had better pizzas at other places in Phoenix that had similar flavor profiles & would prefer to go there instead of here in the future."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for your arizonans, who while having an enormous amount of places to eat at, have to settle for such mediocrity.  Here in LA these restaurants wouldn't stand a chance of staying in business for this reason.

Visiting friends recommended this place as \"great\" and so we had take out, which in all fairness does affect food quality.  But this is pizza, probably the best takeout food one can order.  Ordered the BLT pizza and it was a monstrosity.  Picture bacon on a sauceless pie, with a side order of shredded lettuce and tomatoes with a ramekin of mayonaise on the side!

That is exactly what this dish is.  Disgusting!  Whoever in their right mind thought mayonaise on a pizza was a good idea needs their head examined.

Also ordered the strawberry and gongonzola salad which was edible, just not great.  Prices were the best part of this place, a bad attempt at knocking off CPK(which I wish we went to).  Calories are too precious to be wasted on bad or mediocre food.  Avoid this place if you agree....."}
{"text":"Went in with my brother and nephew on Saturday night and was NOT impressed. The service was bad and the food was mediocre. When we arrived we had to wait several minutes to be acknowledged, then once taken to our table it took several minutes before the hostess (not the waitress) came back to take our drink order. We ordered a kid's pizza for my 3-year-old nephew (kids are supposed to eat free on Sat and Sun) and instead the waitress brought out a full-size pizza. This was our first visit, so we were a little confused and didn't say anything, but once the bill arrived we had been charged for two full-size pizzas. We should have spoke to a manager, but my brother was really unhappy with the experience and just wanted to pay the bill and leave."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing spectacular. The fries though are amazing, the seasoning... The pizza is a bit dry but admittedly I like more sauce than most people.  The decor definitely needs help. I was just expecting a bit more."}
{"text":"The last time we went in there the service was horrible.  We waited a long time for our drinks and after we mentioned the poor service, we were treated hostility by a woman who i think was the manager (dark hair).  We have been coming here for years and i have to say we will probably never be back until they change out the staff."}
{"text":"Not a big fun of this place, I m more like traditional pizza girl. But service was very good and fast. I wouldn't go back but will recommend to try it at least once , maybe it is ur kind of pizza."}
{"text":"FYI - Make sure you double check your bill, especially if you go with your kids on Sunday. Our waiter forgot to take off the kids meals and my husband happened to catch it. The waiter said he forgot."}
{"text":"Had the calamari as an appetizer. They were no good. The lady behind us didn't eat but one of hers and sent the plate back. Other than that it was pretty good. Fries were thin but tasty. And they have diet mountain dew. Bonus. Lol"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Humble Pie in Scottsdale last night, the bar tender Marcus was very polite, had great recommendations which were awesome and has a great personality! The bar has a great set up, had it been a little warmer I would've sat at the outside bar.. They did have heaters but inside was just as nice. I had the huge wedge salad, the lettuce was crispy, all veggies were fresh but the only ingredient missing was BACON! Shame on you, Humble Pie! I also had the margherita pizza only because I had to try a pie! This is a must try and enough for two, maybe 3 if you have starters.. No need to over stuff yourself! If I have another chance to come back while in Scottsdale, I definitely will!"}
{"text":"I told you (our server) that I was going to write a review today!! Yes, it was THAT GOOD!!! As time goes on, I write less and less reviews, but Humble Pie deserves this review today!! 

The weather is beautiful and it's the perfect time to sit on their outdoor patio!! I love the fact that the entire front area window / wall of windows slide open, so the whole place feels fresh and outdoorsy even if you sit inside!! 

The many meat pizza is just amazing!!! So many extremely fresh and QUALITY meats piled onto the perfect crust with fresh mozzarella piled to compliment the whole package!!! We really, really, really like this one the best, although the others are great too!!!

We will be back soon to fix my CRAVING!!!

My only recommendation to the owner:  Put in some booths!!! We love the look, feel and comfort of booths!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST pizza spots!! They use extremely good quality meats on their pizzas and the crust is just amazing!! Their salads are tasty too! Love the meat lover's pizza!! I haven't tried any of the others because it is too hard for me to stray from the meat lover's! One day I will have to force myself to do so...one day...eventually...maybe!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was our fault that we didn't go for Happy Hour pricing like many other reviewers mentioned, but when we received our tiny little Meat Lovers pizza at the full price of $17, we were extremely disappointed. The size could be ignored if the pizza itself was mind-blowing, but it was not. I wouldn't put it on the same level as fast food pizza chains, but it is not even close to any of the other specialty gourmet pizza places in the area which use fresh ingredients and have signature sauces. We also ordered the fried ravioli, which was good enough, but all in all, just as the pizza, it was sickeningly average. 
Do they only price their food so high just so they can slash it down for happy hour? I think that's good business sense for them given the quality of their products but I won't be giving this place another chance when I'm actually craving pizza for taste and flavor."}
{"text":"I don't live in Scottsdale, but co-hosted a party for a bridal party at HP last weekend--about 15 people.  I had a chopped salad which was tasty--however, the service was HORRIBLE especially given the fact that we had a reservation and they were expecting a large party.  They didn't take our orders all together, and people were served at radically different times (like 15 minutes between one person or group being served and another).  I found that to be totally unacceptable...."}
{"text":"What a fantastic happy hour!! I arrived about 4:30 and it was happy hour and it ended at 6. I have no idea when it officially starts, sorry. 
All draft beer pints are $2.50 except Bud Light which is $2.00. The beers on draft included Stella Artois, Drop Top, Four Peaks, and some others I can't remember because I don't drink beer. I had a delicious glass of summer sangria made from white wine and it was very refreshing. I also had a sweet tea vodka cocktail and they were each $5. They also had a huge selection of wines that were $5 a glass. Happy enough for you? 
NO??? Well, we also indulged in a happy hour priced, $3, small Caesar salad. It was basic and delicious. Romaine, celery, croutons, lemon juice, and an unfishy Caesar dressing. My friends then each had a happy hour sized (8 inches) pepperoni pizza for $5. I found a coupon on their website for a $7.95 pizza, so I got the 11 inch meatball pizza. The meatballs were AWESOME!!! I think the pie needed to be cooked a bit longer to be strong enough to support those big balls. I had a fork and knife, so I went about eating it that way. The upper crust was somewhat buttery and the crispness was just right. 
The service was great as well. We sat at the bar and the bartender asked each of us our names, shook our hands, and then remembered our names and what we wanted when we would request anything from him. 
3 salads, 3 pizzas, 2 beers, and 2 cocktails for about $50?!?!?! Unheard of. I'm definitely a fan. A super fan of their happy hour."}
{"text":"I love wood fired pizza, and Humble Pie is my favorite in the valley. The new location at OdySea is very nice.  No lunch pizza/salad specials like at the other locations, and no Schreiner's Sicilian pizza on the menu here, but maybe with a little pressure they'll bring over my favorites.  Strawberry Gorgonzola salad IS on the menu, and the large will feed two adults easily. The kids' pizza is nice and big.  Worth the stop if you're eating in this 'hood!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for pizza and asked a couple friends for recommendations in our Scottsdale area.  They recommended Humble Pie.  We split a medium pizza.  It was delish.  We ordered an appetizer.  Well, friend green beans.  First time for everything.  We both really enjoyed them.  They were unique.  We were please with our service and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Scenario.  Saturday night 815pm.  A couple at the bar,  6-8 staff members, 1 host & the 2 of us.  Ordered the meat lovers pizza and the pepperoni pizza.  While we were there another couple arrived, the bar couple left.  2 take out orders for pick up showed up.  It was embarrassing to watch the staff being unable to accommodate the orders, very unorganized.  Not sure how they handle a crowd with the limited brick fireplace for pizzas.  I was not at all impressed with the pizza and it was a very expensive meal for 2.  Our server definitely was trying - I'll give him that.   Nothing humble about these pies.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Great lunch special, a plate sized personal pizza (any pizza on their regular menu), and a tasty salad for $12. The crust (wood fired) is very, very tasty. We come here often, it's a short drive from downtown offices. Parking can be a challenge at times. But the service is fast, efficient, and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my local Humble Pie location and I have enjoyed many dinners here with my girlfriend.  At this point, we have just about tried all of the menu items!  The bruschetta is especially fantastic but we are never disappointed by the pizza either!  Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a quick drink and food. The guy next to us took two bites of his chicken  wings and left the rest there. The other table's food looked really bad so we just ordered 2 shots of Don Julio BLANCO cause they didn't have A√±ejo. No biggie. We were offered a double for 3 bucks more each. Ok cool. That double was not a double but we thought, ok.   I even mentioned to the waitress that didn't look like a double but she didn't respond. Whatever...till we got the bill. 34 bucks for 2 shots. Like really?????  We travel ALOT and that is way too much for what we got (AT an AIRPORT). I paid it and when I left, I told the hostess that that was mega expensive and I was gonna YELP them. As I was walking away, she said, Do IT!!!  Wow!  So we went next door to  Noca sandwich shop. The air vents and light fixture right above the tables hadn't  been cleaned in YEARS!  Wow. PHOENIX!!!  Y'all should be embarrassed!!!  I will spare you the pictures. Don't wanna ruin YOUR lunch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Drove to this place tonight to have dinner with my family. Arrive around 8:15PM just to be told they closed their kitchen early. The guy was not very friendly about it either."}
{"text":"Salad was warm, pizza was cold, not sure why.  Service was terrible. She didn't seem to care, not once was our water refilled, food was bland/"}
{"text":"Not a large selection of drinks, 4 beers on tap and limited hard alcohol. Burgers, salads and sandwiches on the menu. A lot of seating and a few tvs."}
{"text":"Yummy! That's how I'll start this review. Their food is pretty amazing, the staff is attentive and nice. It's a little expensive for a pizza place but worth it in my opinion. The ONLY downside to this place is they have one size of pizza and it's not that big for multiple people. However the doesn't deter me from coming back. The bar has a fun atmosphere to it, nice place to come after work and have a few drinks and relax."}
{"text":"Good service however food needs improvement - The pizza was as bland as could be. Ruined my lunch...Soda @ $ 2.95 with free refills is pushing it as in excessive and greedy.  I used to love Humble Pie however my lunch was very disappointing...they've lost their game."}
{"text":"Asked for a 5oz pour of Malbec. She gave me the 8oz pour and charged me $19! Yikes! I told her that I asked for the 5oz and she (of course) passed it off as a simple mix up. I get that it's the airport but GOOD GOD! $19 dollars for a GLASS of wine?! No thank you! Next time, I'll be walking my booty down to Zinc Brasserie...way more reasonable prices and their staff actually have a personality."}
{"text":"We came in with a gigantic lunch party and the place was packed so it's hard to demand the absolute best. Overall, the pizza was great and we were well taken care of. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. They have exceptional sangria, great service and staff, and the outdoor misters always wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Second visit and we ordered takeout. Got home to find the pizza was wrong. Starving after a 10K race, I called to let the manager know. He was extremely courteous and had the pizza remade and credited to my card. When I arrived, he greeted me at the door w an additional apology and invitation to return for a complimentary pie. What great customer service! The pizza, breadsticks and arugula salad were all delicious."}
{"text":"Truly a \"humble\" pie. There was literally nothing on top of the 12 inch cheese pizza. Very disappointed. Too little cheese. The pizza is very overpriced for the quantity."}
{"text":"It was really good.  They accommodated our large group of friends, the server was really friendly and fantastic - all of our orders were correct and there wasn't an issue splitting the bill. Overall, it's a nice place to hang out and have drinks and pizza with friends."}
{"text":"Came in on 7/28/16 with my family of 4. We were immediately acknowledged and sat at a table. There was a bit of a wait for the order and drinks to arrive, but that wasn't a problem. We ordered two 10\" pizzas, one cheese for my daughter, and one bbq chicken pizza, which were both fantastic. The problem was that we also ordered a child pasta for my 5yo son which didn't show up until the very end of the rest of us being done eating. When it was delivered, we revived a small apology and was told she didn't know why it took so long for a child pasta, which was macaroni noodles, marinara, and meatballs and all they had times do was assemble. I gave it a three because the pizza was good. Service was ok, we weren't asked how the food was, or even received any discount."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with a very friendly staff and excellent food.  I moved close by a year ago and it has become one of my go to restaurants.  Good portion size for the money.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the location, I am definitely coming back!  However, I was expecting the same menu and wine list as the Humble Pie on Scottsdale Road so I felt disappointed they did not have the same things.  The waiter told me they are working on it so I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Humble Pie numerous times and it has never failed.  I feel like a regular and even the waitress remembered my favorite drink.  The food is excellent and service is great. Lori really went beyond her call of duty.  Can't wait to come back...."}
{"text":"I didn't love this place the first time I went, but I went back tonight because of a mailer deal. When we got there they were completely unorganized and sat 3 other parties of 2 before us (we were also a party of 2, there first). They finally sat us, with no menus and no utensils. They sat a couple after us and brought them water, and still nothing for our table. We finally gave up and left. Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been called lots of things, but \"foodie\" isn't one of them. However, i know what I like and expect and Humble Pie exceeded both. We are new to AZ and Humble Pie came highly recommended. Glad we listened. Loved the decor and the service (thanks Rizzo) was very good. Our food was outstanding (shared a chopped salad and each had our own pizza). I had the olive pizza and it's now my favorite. My wife raved about hers and she's not a big pizza fan. Bottom line is we loved Humble Pie and will be back."}
{"text":"Layover airport food. Seemed very fancy, but quality was meh. Lady at register looked unhappy to be there. The pizza was partially burnt, and I thought a bit pricey ($11) for the quality and size. It wasn't terrible, but I probably wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful of this place being awesome and then I just got disappointed that it was just an average pizza joint.  I had the antipasto plate and then the egg pizza.  Both items were just average and that's all I can say about the place as a whole just average.  Now I would go back for a happy hour because they had some great deals but if I'm craving pizza I will head to one of my fav's instead."}
{"text":"After volleyball in foreign territory, we wanted a bite to eat and Yelp pulled this up as being \"nearby\".  So off we went.  A party of 6 at 6pm on Saturday and they quickly pulled a table together for us, yay!  We had quick service and ordered appetizers and dinner.  

Uhoh...a while later no appetizers.  A few minutes later our server advised that a snafu on the tickets meant they kitchen didn't get the order so our appetizers were on the house.  Much appreciated management of that problem.

I got the veggie salad, very light and fresh and good!  Then shared the shrimp pizza...and WOW.  Big yum.  Not overly cheesy, large fresh hunks of shrimp, and a really fresh lemony, slightly spicy sauce.  Not too spicy because I'm a wimp, but very flavorful.  And really good crust.  Add a nice glass of wine and I really enjoyed this meal!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. I will eat it again. The servers were a little rude and almost \"too busy\" to help us but the worst thing was that our server brought our napkin-wrapped silverware to us by carrying it in his armpit. Besides being against the health code, our napkins smelled like armpit sweat and were damp to the touch. We couldn't use them. Order the pizza to go. Don't eat at the restaurant unless you want sweat-stained napkins."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good. But $15 for a single jim beam?  That is at least three times normal full price at a bar.  Food was premium and worth it.  But pizza cost less than Jim Beam?!  Bartender said he knew and agreed.  Spoke to manager and told him it was good food and good service but that the $15 was out of line. He replied, \"I hear you.\"  But took no action. The point of customer service is to listen to customers... And that price is insulting."}
{"text":"For being about pizza the selection is slim and the service was not that great.  Took a little bit longer to get food due to they were out of things and had to re-order."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Good gluten free option, nice selection of wines"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Salads and flatbreads are amazing. Salads are very big (enough for 2). Waiters are great and food comes out fast."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was awesome.  I got the margarita and it had very fresh toppings.  The dough was thin and a little thicker on the ends.  The sauce tasted fresh.  The staff was friendly and quick.  We are here twice on the way to and from San Diego. Both times were just as great."}
{"text":"Fast! Amazingly delicious and easy to order. I have 2 very picky kids and they followed the order request perfectly! 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's starting to get warmer, and al fresco dining is becoming, in a word, delightful!
With that in mind, the Beautiful Carin and I, while we were out running a few errands today, were trying to decide what to do for lunch. 
Instead of the sandwich or late Sunday breakfast option, we were close to Humble Pie and decided to stop in. 
We hadn't been there in 3-4 months (one of the things I love about Yelp is that it pushes me to both try new places and revisit spots that I haven't been to in awhile).
It was not busy, which was both a blessing and disquieting. There should be more people there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon! 
The food is really very good, and the service was excellent (both better than the last time we were there, I think). 
I don't know if I attribute that to a less crowded place, or just improvements in everything, overall. I don't know and I shouldn't over-analyze.
We sat on the patio, and it is very comfortable and pleasant out there. This is a quiet corner of the Hilton Village strip mall, so it's easy to enjoy a conversation with out traffic and noise.
We had a sausage and roasted fennel pizza and veggie salad. Both were terrific! I prefer a more savory than sweet pizza, generally, and this one walked the line nicely. The tomato sauce and the roasted fennel have just enough sweetness to provide a counterpoint to the salty sausage and olives. Crust has a great texture and flavor, in and of itself, and was nicely baked, with just a little blackness at the edges. Nice Job!
The salad was extremely fresh and nicely dressed. 
Add in decent hefevitzen and that's what I call lunch!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected.  The only reason they got a 3 was because they use brick fired ovens. We had the pepperoni pizza and they use cheap pepperoni like hormel.   We also had the cheesy bread which we both thought was better then the pizza. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Happy hour. Do it. Wines are cheap and a Margherita will set you back like $10. Totally worth it. It helps that the crust is really quite good. I live in Chicago and my allegiance is still to thin-crust pizzas like this and the New York-style. They might shoot me in Chicago for saying such things but whatever."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, and have always enjoyed the food and service. Today however I met a collegue for lunch and we arrived at 11:15, there was one other table in the whole place. We sat at the corner of the bar, and after ordering we were sitting there enjoying our iced teas when a manager came up and asked us if we would mind moving. Moving I asked? Yes. We have a regular couple who comes in on Mondays and only likes to sit at this corner of the bar, would you move? The place was empty mind you. Of course we agreed to move. But would have thought that we would be comped a little something for being agreeable. We could have said no. Regardless there wasn't even a thank you. The manager walked by our table several times while we were eating, didn't ask how we were doing or even acknowledge us. This is not the kind of place that I will come back to."}
{"text":"We had just returned from Rome and Naples and ended up comparing our Caesar and Margherita with what we'd just had in the old country...very favorably. With great service and an attractive happy hour and you have a keeper."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! All the food was delectable and the half price bottles on Monday can't be beat."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I honestly rarely leave a bad review and never had a bad daily deal site coupon experience before. Lets start from the moment I walked in. Actually rewind before that so you get the whole picture. After playing a softball game I was starving and did not want to cook at home. So I pulled out my trusty phone and wizz to my daily deal coupon app I had at Humble Pie. Literally I drive across town to eat here with my mouth watering. As I walked in the door I get hit with a funky smell. At first I thought it could of been me since I was playing softball in 110F weather but wait it wasn't  me! The smell was sewage. I pulled up my pants said well I drove across town and I am starving so I will just ignore it. After I waited for about 5 min no one came to seat me so I just sat myself at a table. About 10 min after that I finally had a waiter come over and take my order. Must of been a test to see if you really could stand the smell (like one of those hidden camera shows).  I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before I got my meal. The bathroom was below average. Was not horrible but more like college dorm room bathroom where you are happy you have soap and roll toilet paper. The food came out pretty quickly after that. The salad and pizza I thought were pretty small servings more like kid menu items but I did not care since I was starving but it tasted alright. At the end I waived my waiter down to pay the bill. I told him I had a daily deal site coupon and he said no problem since your bill was below $20 you just have to cover tax. The waiter said he would have to get the manager to run the promotion deal. The waiter came back 5 mins later and said well you ordered a special so you cant use your daily deal site coupon unless you pay full retail. I was thrown back with this because I did not order special but just an everyday item. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over, I told him what happen. The manager was confrontational about the situation which totally threw me off track. I was like dude your place smells of sewage, bathrooms could be cleaned more than 1 time a day, someone could greet you as you walk in and lastly,  learn to  manage the situation better. In the end I debated with the manager for about 5 min over the situation and paid the tab to get out of there. So for over $5 disagreement over the bill this company has lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 2 stars because the service was so bad. I ordered the fried mozzarella and the BLT pizza for dinner. I also ordered the apple cocktail. All three of the items were very tasty and flavorful.  The pizza was like and flaky and had a great flavor. 

So let's come to the service. When I sat down I was greeted right away and asked for a water and the apple seasonal drink. The drinks came quickly.  I ordered the app and pizza at the same time. The app took awhile  (it happens) but was good. Then I waited for the pizza. It did finally arrive and it was the wrong one. I had to wait while they remade the pizza for me.

Then the bill came.  They tried to bill me for 2 pizzas, not one. Then they tried to bill me 3 bucks for water. Really, water. I finally spoke to the manager and they removed it from the bill.

If you are planning to order take out this might be the place for it. But if you plan to have a nice relaxing pizza this is not your place"}
{"text":"The only reason to go here is the drinks.  Hit Happy Hour then go home and order Papa Johns. First visit here on a Friday night, sat at the outside bar ordered a couple of drinks that where awesome. The Bartender was great. The hostesses came to tell us our table was ready we had to pay the bar tab so when we walked up to her she actually pointed to a table with menus and didn't walk us over, first fail!  The waiter was super nice so he got the restaurant a star. The inside was as hot as outside  but don't eat outside because you can smell the grease intercepters. Gross! We got breshetta that was good and the SOP pizza that was slightly burnt on top and the crust on the bottom was still soggy. All of the toppings where in the middle of the pizza 2nd Fail! The sause is way too sweet and the crust has no flavor. I would rather have had Papa Johns."}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars because I have had good experiences up to this point and I have enjoyed their happy hour menu, but I will not plan to go back.

Read review by Alex M.  Manager is confrontational.  I agree.  Read our experience and found the same situation with the \"Manager\".  Man needs some training.

I went there with some girlfriends and we got there on a Fri night at 5:30.  I got seated right away and my server came up immediately for service.  I ordered a drink off the happy hour menu and my server said he couldn't make the drink because he doesn't have all the ingredients available.  Very matter of fact - I was like - ok.....and then he offered another drink option which I took.  Just kind of weird that he didn't start with I'm sorry, but we can offer you this instead.

My girlfriends started to arrive and again the server was right there to help.  I asked one of my friends while our server was there if she bought the Groupon coupon.  She said yes and  he then interrupted us and told us that if we are going to use the groupon we had to let them know up front and to not expect to be able to use it for Happy Hour and so if we are going to \"pound down\" a bunch of happy hour items and then expect to use the Groupon we can't.  He proceeded to tell us we better order food at the regular price to get our bill \"up there\" and that he is going to get real busy and doesn't want to have his time \"wasted\" nor our time wasted when we are ready to pay the bill.  

We were so floored my girlfriends told him to wait on their drink order and he left.  We decided to leave and asked one of the other servers if the manager was around.  Low and behold our server was the manager.  He came back and we told him that he was rude and used a very poor choice of words when telling us how to use the Groupon coupon.  He started arguing with us about what he said.   And also started telling us about how great he is and that he had someone just tell him the previous day what a great experience they had.  Who cares.  No matter how he felt he should have apologized and then offered maybe a free appetizer or drink for the misunderstanding instead of arguing."}
{"text":"We took out from here two nights in a row whilst on vacation in the area.  The food and the service was absolutely amazing.  Definitely get the fried mozzarella and green bean tempura!  I wish these were in Texas."}
{"text":"Today is Veterans Day, many fine offerings for we vets.  Out of all places for lunch, I chose Humble Pie, with Schreiners Italian sausage pizza....da best, Yum.  Always a touchdown........"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Arizona for thin crust take-out pizza!"}
{"text":"Hazelnuts on the green beans.
Pistachios on the pizza. 
Some sort of delicious seed-thing (anise? coriander? i should know but i don't cook. it was yum) on the olives. 

And caramel on the chocolate chip cookie/vanilla ice cream dessert thing.

Combine this with that amazing glass of Argentinian white I had and you've got a pretty tasty treat. 

Humble Pie made a pretty inventive, attractive, tasty meal, and they didn't brag about it or anything. 

I'd totally go back."}
{"text":"I always like the pizza.  Service is usually good.  Sundays the place is packed with kids (mine included) since it is Kids eat free.  Sometimes the eggs on the pizza are over cooked, but they always fix it for us.  I will be back"}

{"text":"We frequent Humble Pie weekly. We have noticed that the happy hour pepperoni pizza is lacking cheese almost every time you order it.  We figured if you order a cheese happy hour pizza and up charge pepperoni it is perfect. Today they screwed up the order - had them remake the pizza - 20 minutes later our waiter tells us it will be at least 20-30 more minutes pizza station is all backed up.  Spoke to David the manager to complain he barely made eye contact. Piss poor management tonight - must be a manager in training. Wait staff was great - very apologetic - comp'd the whole meal.  The wait-staff saved the evening!!"}
{"text":"Get SOP pizza it's great I came here before in a flight out to burbank ca and got mushroom pizza that's wasn't so good today they recommended SOP and it is great."}
{"text":"Had the chicken, potato and rosemary pizza, it was kind of bland. Friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and said it was nothing spectacular. Pizookie (don't know what they call it here but its a cookie pizza) was the best part. We came right before the dinner rush and as people started trickling in they wanted us out. No refilled water glasses. 

Food is nothing special, kind of over priced, service was rushed. Won't be returning probably."}
{"text":"I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. 

At lunch. 
No cover charge. 
No two minimum drink.

FREE ENTERTAINMENT
It wasn't just me either. Side splitting laughs from the service provided by our server, Rizzo were heard throughout the restaurant. I wish I had caught the other fellas names who were singing and putting on a show. (Listing to Bon Jovi, Bruce Springstein and whatnot takes on a whole new meaning when someone else is passionately belting it out.)

I said singing, but, no. That does not quite describe the action that was going. I really wish I had a photo. Think Elvis. Arms swinging, legs shaking, THAT.

I've photographed everything in the world, but not this. I've failed you.

FOOD
I wasn't sure what my stomach was in the mood for, so I ordered the soup | 1/2 sandwich lunch special. Sweet deal for $8.95! 

The Creamy Butternut Squash soup greeted my with the cutest sour cream detail. (see photo!) It was also incredibly rich. In private I'd probably lick the bowl. (Sorry Mom!)

The Grilled Caprese Sandwich surprised me a bit. (Mozzarella, pesto, roasted grape tomatoes.) Grilled cheese sandwiches are meant to be buttered. This one was definitely buttered!  

SEATING
The bar area provides a nice view of the pizza hearth. There is additional high top seating in the bar area. In the back of the restaurant there are low top, four top tables that can be pushed together to accommodate groups.

SIDE STORY
We heard Rizzo taking photos of another group.
\"Will you take our picture?\"
\"Sure!\"
[Takes pictures using everyone's camera]
\"Can I take a picture with MY camera?\"

There is a cute outdoor patio area as well. I asked Tracy J. to take photos of this area and some others for us. (These walking sticks will be the death of me!)

GREAT SERVICE
I joked about the show. But we were checked on constantly. Our drinks were never empty. Our plates were cleared as we nibbled away. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and appreciated the great customer service.

Love it!"}
{"text":"We did take out from Humble Pie.

Ordered 1 pepperoni and 1 Ham and Olives (more like straight up Bacon, yum) and the iceberg wedge salad.

When the order was called in, they said \"ready in 15!\" and it was-- that was quicker than any other pizza place I know of.

It was awesome pizza and that iceberg salad was excellent! I am looking forward to going back.  This was takeout, so I would like to try to actually dine there.

I've received a couple cool coupons from Humble Pie in those Val-Pac coupon envelopes, I know most people toss them out, but I actually look thru them and I've received a free pizza coupon with $20 of in dining purchase-- need to use that!"}
{"text":"While I type this I just rejoiced on how fast my food came out after I ordered it. It's because it was pre-made. No worries, speed is needed at the airport. But oh my. This may be the grossest $8 breakfast burrito ever. Egg, cheese, bacon in a tortilla. Not a lick of any spice. Just runny eggs. Not even a dash of pepper. Nothing. Avoid this place. You are better off eating a bag of pepperoni flavored combos from the newsstand."}
{"text":"This place has yet to disappoint us and we have been here a handful of times. Amazing happy hour specials and I am in a deep deep love with their marinara sauce as well as their mozzarella cheese. KID FRIENDLY!  Loud at times so don't come to have a quiet dinner. Decent prices, but my husband can eat a whole pizza himself (shoot, so can I ...) so it adds up! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best airport food ever !
Great service !!
That's all I have to say but stupid yelp insists I write more so there you have it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot at airport!
Great staff and food!
They care and are proud of the food and service that they provide. 
I take 1/2 of the pizza back to Pasadena Ca..it's so good!
Shout out to Andre! &Anthony!"}
{"text":"We got to humble pie right when it opened. Our group had 8 people, but again, we got there right when they opened so we were our server's only table. We constantly had to ask for refills on drinks and for him to remove our appetizer plates from the table to make room for entrees. 

The appetizers were good. I recommend the fried ravioli, fried mozzarella and tempura green beans. 

The pizza seems so undercooked! The dough was floppy. Maybe that's just how they cook it? Either way, not a fan of the pizza."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went in for date night. I really liked the inside of the place although the outdoor area looked great too. We opted for inside and sat near the bar area. The menu is pretty large maybe because I went in thinking it was just going to be pizza. Lots of things looked appetizing but we both opted for pizza. We each ordered one so we could try a couple things and they were reasonably priced (around $10 each). I ordered the Margherita pizza and hubby ordered the meat lovers. I was not a huge fan of my pizza but my husband's was good and he ate the entire thing. I would either order a different pizza or try something else on the menu. They have a good selection of beers and it looked like a great selection of wine, which I plan to try next time we are in. So yes, even though I didn't care for my pizza I will come back and try something else because I liked the environment."}
{"text":"This is how my breakfast came, it looks half eaten already. I didn't know I should ask when it says sausage on the menu I should have to ask if I get a whole piece."}
{"text":"I liked the toasted ravioli.  Our waiter was nice and fast.  I wish I didn't eat out of MSY before my layover in PHX.  I was very lucky to have been seated near an outlet to charge my phone."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about with the service.  We had no problem.  It was a bit akward at first when you walk in because it's unclear where the hostess station is, but you can figure it out pretty quick once they ask you how many in your party.  We came here on a Friday night and it was packed.  We received good service, however it did take a bit to get our food, which is expected when it's so busy.  The food tasted great.  We had pizza and a bruschetta appetizer.  Wine was good too.  I like their patio set up, and they have the heavy duty heat lamps to keep you warm.  I'm glad they have a Humble Pie close by!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good wine, good atmosphere.  What more do you want?  We ate outside and even in June it was fine as they had the misters going.  I had the mac and cheese and it was really tasty.  We added a bottle of wine and even with 2 entrees the bill wasn't too bad.  The building is realtively new (5 years or less I'm guessing) so everything inside is new and very nice.  I like the lighting in here- it's dark, quiet and they even have a couple TVs for the sports fan."}
{"text":"Ugh... I have had the food at humble pie in the airport and it was fine, but way overpriced. On this visit, I was drawn in by a menu stating a glass of sangria was 7$... Definitely as cheap as I would get a drink in this part of the airport. I ordered a glass and it was fairly mediocre. Got the bill...  It cost 9$... What the... I asked for the menu again, apparently they changed the price on most of the menus using pen or marker, but not the one I had seen. There was no way for me to prove it, so I sadly paid for the crappy drink and was on my way. I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, the airport is no longer a desolate wasteland of awful food, SO this makes the Humble Pie (which would have otherwise probably been a great airport option) not so great. The pizzas are expensive (our meatball pizza was about 17$) and wasn't that delicious. Was it bad? No, it just wasn't worth the 17$. There are better options in Sky Harbor (but if your flight leaves out of the gate next door and your pressed for time, it isn't the worst option either)."}
{"text":"So I had bought a groupon for this location right as it was changing from the Living Room to Humble Pie. Then, as the reviews came in, I started to dread going here... I was kind of scared that I made the wrong decision. Well, we went tonight and honestly, I'm glad we went. It's not because it was super awesome, but they do have some super awesome fantastic garlic fries! These things were good. They were garlicky, spicy, and lemon -y. Soooo good. I'd come back just for these. The rest of the food was pretty meh. We got the tomato bruschetta and it was ok, but the bread they use is too soft and got soggy and the balsamic was watery. We also got a margharita pizza (mostly to go, but we each had a slice there) and it kind of tasted like the frozen pizza you can get at trader joe's. So not awesome, and with so many excellent pizza places in the area, this would not be my first or even like tenth choice.... But they were nice to us, even though we came in at like 9 pm and the fries! yum. Maybe try happy hour?"}
{"text":"Great choice for a reasonably priced lunch combination.  They have several lunch combos Monday through Friday.  I always lean toward a Pizza paired with a Strawberry Gorgonzola Salad. Fast Service, indoor/outdoor restaurant, hopping vibe."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  I would really recommend humble pie.
I have seen alot of people on here complain about the $7.00 fries, but they were the best (and unique) fries I probably have ever had.  The portion was also huge!  It was enough for my husband, my son and I to share.  I think that is worth $7.00.  We got 2 humble pies...1 was just pepperoni and mozzarella, the other was the margarita pie.  Both pies were very good, the crust is excellent, chewy and crispy, just the way I like it.  On the margarita pie we added prosciutto, which tasted a little funny to me, but other than that everything was excellent.  The decor was nice, it seems that they put alot into choosing it.  The only things that I didn't like were the music that they were playing, I don't think I should be subjected to Nickleback while I am eating, and our server wasn't very friendly.
Other than that you should check this place out, and please don't skip the fries, just share them!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been enjoying their food and staff for a couple years now. The staff is always friendly and have gotten to know us over time. My kids always enjoy going there because the staff always make them feel welcome as do we. We always enjoy the food no matter what we order. Their days of the week specials are a great deal as well. 

The food is amazing! Our fav pizza is the Chicken Pesto, with the yummy cheese and perfect amount of pesto topped with crispy fried onions. Our fav salad is the Chopped Salad with fresh mozzarella and tasty tomatoes. we have always liked the french fries. Although, don't let the name fool you because these are not your average french fries. No ketchup needed when you have fries topped with parsley, garlic, and cheese then dipped in a garlic aioli sauce. A new item on the menu that I really liked is Tempura Fried Green Beans with a mustard aioli sauce. mmmm very yummy! These are our favs but like I said we have enjoyed everything we've ever ordered. 

It's our go-to spot, whether we want a casual lunch or dinner as a family, evening out with some friends, or date night with my husband. I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"The last time I was at phoenix airport I had the worst pizza from that New York style pizza place so I see humble pie and was hesitant to try it but I really had no choice because the grill to the burger joint was down so after searching for other options I had to try it.  I got the pizza with roasted fennel and sausage and house mozzarella, and onions and loaded with sauce. So I don't know what Chris V was talking about when he said they don't put a lot of toppings in their pizza. It was loaded with toppings.  I absolutely loved it. Absolute turnaround from that other place. And originally I wanted a burger."}
{"text":"Wow this place was pretty awesome...cute lil neighborhood joint with very good pizza.

I am used to great eats in L.A., where I live, but this I wish this place was near me.

First off, they have FREE kids meals with each adult entree purchase on certain nights. I think we were there on a Sunday evening. We got like 4 FREE kids meals, which helps when you have a caravan of kiddoes...

The pizzas and salads were surprisingly good... we tried a caesar salad, and 3 different pizzas, I can not remember what they were, sorry, but the crust was perfect and the toppings fresh and good. With a cold brew (cute little friendly bar set up too) you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So new I had to add the restaurant myself!!  My husband and I went to Humble Pie last night, just the two of us and sat at the bar. Bre behind the bar was so much fun and a great server. Rock Lobster, Humble Pie and Living Room are all connected and Humble Pie is an excellent replacement to La Sala. Dinner tonight at Humble Pie was unbelievably great with our party of 10! We had drinks, appetizers and pizza. Tempura green beans, toasted ravioli and the spicy chicken drumettes for appetizers were all fantastic! The chopped salad was delicious and second only to the veggie salad. I honestly could eat just the veggie salad as a meal...so good! The pizza was delicious and perfectly cooked. My favorite is the shrimp pizza. I'm going to crave that yummy deliciousness. They have a wonderful draft beer selection and their mixed drinks are also creative and delicious. And I haven't even gotten to the people. As always, GM Dave was so welcoming and wonderful and our server Paul left us wanting for nothing and was super friendly and efficient. And their Summer specials are pretty great too. Check them out. We'll be spending a lot of time at this restaurant!  Their grand opening is tomorrow, May 29th.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"If you like good service don't expect it here. Lousy at best. Table of 12 with only two other couples in the restaurant. Drinks stayed empty,  no ask for appetizers or dessert. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. The lunch pizza & salad combo was delish. Caesar salad and Chicken Pesto pizza were good portions and price. The happy hour sangria is yummy too :) great service, atmosphere  and food!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!! They have the most delicious pizza. Ive been to pizza bianco and the have nothing on humble pie. Good food, good service, good atmosphere. If anyone asks for a good pizza place, this is where I am telling them to go."}
{"text":"I went with friends on a saturday night and only had to wait for about 5 min. The place is really small. Friendly wait staff. I had a glass of white sangria. Loved it! I liked the selection of different pizza. I had the chicken parm. and tomatoe basil. Tomatoe basil was borning and the other was a little dry. Mabey because that's from the thin crust. The brushetta was good but it came as 2 slices of bread. Not the cute little bite size pieces. I would go back and try a different pizza and some other menue choices."}
{"text":"Good pizza with a flavorful crust.  Tasty spaghetti & meatballs. Attentive service. Interesting recorded music in the outside eating area - very eclectic."}
{"text":"I went here whilst staying in AZ with a friend - she heard about this place and wanted to try it out.

We got there just before the end of Happy Hour and sat on the patio.  We ordered a margarita pizza (6\") and the buffalo wings along with a couple of drinks.

The wings were very \"saucy\", but had a good flavor and were pretty large - I think the wings are $5 on the Happy Hour menu which is very reasonable.

The pizza was good - I am sure they make their own dough - but it really reminded me of a \"Freschetta\" pizza (which I saw as a good thing as I like their crust), it is thicker and chewier than some pizzas, but it did taste good.

We ordered their potato & rosemary pizza to go (for my friends family back at the house) and that really wasn't that great.  The potatoes were cut pretty thick and there was a distinct lack of rosemary flavor on the pizza - I would not recommend you try this pizza.

They have a lot of pizza options and so I could be persuaded to go back and try some others, but I wouldn't pick to go here if it was my choice."}
{"text":"The pretzel app was great, salad good, but the pizza is completely lacking. The sauce is basically tomato paste."}
{"text":"Place is super dark. pizza really wasn't anything special, and burnt... i was hungry and didn't even finish it. i had the soup as well, it was sausage minestrone. wan't anything amazing either. just your typical overpriced fancy place thats not worth going to in north phoenix. but i will say some positives. awesome service, people, and atmosphere. Very comfortable."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for lunch. They have great lunch specials, even on the weekend. We ordered the meatball appetizer, and it was super tasty, despite not getting the bread that was listed with it on the menu. I ordered the pizza and half salad lunch with a chopped salad and SOP pizza and hubby ordered the Signature sausage and the butternut squash soup. It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"When we walked in it was a little confusing as to who was going to seat us. A guy came up immediately and sat us down. One of the waitresses was standing talking to a guy and blocking one of the seats so we had to wait for a minute for them to move.

We sat down and looked at the menu and decided what we wanted to drink. So, we waited. It was Friday night and busy so we figured a server would be by shortly. We waited, we looked at the menu again and decided on food, so by the time a server showed up we could order everything at once. We shut our menus and waited. Still nothing. Serveral servers passed us in the 20 minutes that we sat there and no one even came by to acknowledge us. Not a \"Be with you in just a minute\" NOTHING. So we got up and left and since we were invisable no one even noticed.

We definitely wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. Cozy and inviting. Staff is happy, good food and choice of wine."}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food. Pizza was mostly bread (good bread but still).  Little on the pricey side but again, what do you expect in the airport. Would have gone for more sauce, chicken and cheese for price."}
{"text":"The barbeque pizza was phenomenal and the hummus is very delicious. First timers, but we just moved here so we're very excited to come back for happy hour and date night."}
{"text":"This pizza was gross and overpriced. I ordered a simple Margherita pizza, something that a pizza place should not screw up. Customer service was good on the other hand, pretty friendly over here.

The pizza looked and smelled good when it came out but unfortunately didn't taste as good as it looked. The pizza was unforgivably bland. Salt and pepper goes a long way people! Use it! They could have added more basil. 

I had to throw it out half way through the pizza, I couldn't do it...a waste of $9 in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend this place when traveling."}
{"text":"I just lunched at the northern-most Humble Pie location.

Landing in the sea of corporate restaurants I was excited to find (on Yelp) that Humble Pie was also located here and provided a great option for the bajillions of homes and homeowners nearby (and this center city girl out of her backyard).

They have an outside option earning any Phoenix restaurant at least 1 star.  Atmosphere was good.  The service was really efficient though a bit lacking in personality (hey, anyone can have an 'off' day though).  Shrimp pizza was great.  Looking at the shrimp before biting in I was sure they were going to be bland and have an off texture BUT I was quite wrong.  Veggie salad is a chop style salad and quite good.  Salt adds a lot to their fresh mozzarella, in the salad. but my husband reminds that it adds to his high blood pressure too.  Fortunately for me--my blood pressure is low - go SALT.

Enjoy, I did."}
{"text":"Humble Pie is the more fatty alternative compared to its rivals...Sauce, Fired Pie, etc.

For this reason, we tend to stick to the other two. All have tasty pizzas with Sauce having the thinest crust, but Humble's was too oily for us."}
{"text":"The food is good here.  We did the Happy Hour Pizza and Salad deal for $11.75, along with an iced tea and a diet coke.  Somehow we ended up with a $26.39 tab.  That escalated quickly!  If you have them split the plate on the salad they charge you $3.00.  It's not the Ritz Carlton, just my take.

The Wedge Salad is great though, and the pizzas are good."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times over the past 4 years at least and it has never disappointed! The meatball pizza is my favorite. Even if you're not gluten free, their gluten free crust is delicious and adds a nice chewy texture to the pizza.

If you're looking for an appetizer, the wings are a great go-to."}
{"text":"After hearing lots of good reviews on Humble Pie, I finally decided to check it out myself. They've got a great happy hour from 3-6 every day that includes $2.50 draft beers, and they've got a lot on tap!

The menu is fairly creative with anything from a margherita pizza to a proscuitto and pear pizza. They're reasonably priced, from about $9-14. They also have some great looking salads, and some pasta including a delicious macaroni and cheese!

I went with the margherita and was pleasantly surprised. The sauce was great, and it had the right amount of cheese, tomatos and basil. I'll definitely be going back, and think I might give one of the more exotic pizzas a try.

Our server was very sweet and attentive. She was respectful of our dallying and the fact that it took us half an hour to actually get an order in."}
{"text":"Whoa, that fig and prosciutto pizza. Blew my mind. Also took 15 minutes from ordering to picking up. Five stars all day."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot! Cheap happy hour, great bartenders and the best pizza. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The pizzas are amazing and very creative. You may have to tell them to go easy on the \"char\" because they have almost burned a few pizzas but I would recommend. Their wings on the appetizer menu are real tasty."}
{"text":"Overall totally average...Pizza and salad while using quality ingredients is boring and dare I say skimpy!  I mean I was seated at the counter once at lunch because the hostess said all the tables were reserved(at lunch?) well barely a quarter of the tables were occupied by the time I left..but I digress..so I am at the counter and this guy who is not wearing gloves and has extremely hairy arms and knuckles is kneading the dough and literally counting out the toppings he is placing on the pizza..Really gross..put on some gloves already. The people who make the salads wear gloves and they barely touch the food!  It is also very loud...in a I can't hear the other person kind of way.  So many better places but if you are curious try it and send in your review..I'll be @ Nello's or having Rosati's deliver"}
{"text":"Man, I feel like there are a LOT of pizza places popping up in central Phoenix, but this is now one of my favorite spots for a pizza lunch.  They have a great lunch special - half a salad and a personal pizza for $9.95.  And you can choose any salad off the menu and any pizza (they have 26!).  There was actually enough food for me to take 3 of my pizza slices home.  I have to say, I prefer this place over Federal Pizza and Pizza People Pub."}
{"text":"Very pleased with our wood-fired pizza, and the Humble Pie dessert was definitely the perfect ending!  The place was a bit noisy which made conversation a little difficult....so go for good food, not an intimate chat ;D"}
{"text":"I've gone to humble pie for many years. They do a decent job for their style pizza sandwiches salads. Been to a few locations and they are fairly consistent."}
{"text":"Service is TERRIBLE!  We arrived around 6 pm.  They were not very busy yet.  Ordered everything at once.  Appetizers came out quickly but our pizza took almost an hour!  Our waiter was bartending as well.  Asked for our Fig, prosciutto & goat cheese pizza to have 1/2 with carmelized onions and even the server that brought it could not tell us what 1/2 had them.  Why??  Because there were none!  Waaaaay overpriced.  Never again."}
{"text":"I ate here alone, with Groupon.  I ordered a bowl $5.95 of creamy butternut squash soup, which was REALLY GOOD.   It was probably the best butternut squash soup I ever had.   I can tell there was lotsa butter in it, and cumin.  But there was not much soup on in the rather flat bowl.  It really made me wonder how much less soup they put in a \"cup\" for $3.95, cos I think the \"bowl\" is a cup of soup poured into a bowl.  I cannot believe that my bowl was more than a cup of soup.  

Also ordered $14.95 Meat Lovers pizza to make my bill at least $20.  All pizzas are the same size, which I measured with a ruler to be 11\".   I won't come back to Humble Pie because I think it is expensive for the little portion that you get for the money.  I like \"value\", which is not here at Humble Pie.   1/3 of the pizza is the crust, which has nothing on it, so the pizza is even smaller.   Taste is good tho.  

I feel the best value for pizza is the House Special at Mellow Mushroom in Tempe.  $20.79 for 14\" and loaded high and dense with ingredients, best of which is the applewood bacon. 

My server, Jon, was very attentive and polite.   When I was amazed they had cloth napkins for greasy pizza, he brought he larger paper napkins, because I went over to the bar and got myself bar paper napkins.  He brought whatever I asked for, lemon wedges and Sweet and Low (I make my own lemonade), more water."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about living in warm weather and being able to sit outside in the patio while waiting to be seated even. I didn't mind waiting, and we were able to get drinks too. Once we were seated I ordered the chopped salad which was the first time I had it with turkey and salami and was quite delicious. I ordered a large, and still felt hungry though. The prices were reasonable and the service was pretty good. Next time I'd like to come back and try an actual pie!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. We went in a large group and were able to sample many menu items. The Goat Cheese and Shrimp pizza were the best. Probably can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"I am so sad to say that I love this place, the food/drinks, and the bartenders but this will be the last time until they add staff.  Not sure what is going on but again it's a Sat night and they have one waitress and a bartender also trying to wait tables.  People are annoyed and the staff get blamed.  Whoever does the staffing needs to seriously wake up!!  There are waaaayyy too many great restaurants within walking distance to continuously understaff this place.  :("}
{"text":"Always like the airport crew at humble pie fast service friendly good menu just had breakfast for the first time at the airport $11 for sausage bacon omelet with fruit potato and toast not bad at all for airport pricing...."}
{"text":"For some reason I have let the place on Adams in downtown with national reviews as my local benchmark for pizza and I keep finding places just as good if not better and Humble pie makes my list. 

To start for appetizers I have had the calamari with basil chili dipping sauce. Very good sauces calimari is like most other local restaurants. Surprisingly a very small portion for ten bucks. Caprese salad was great small portion easily feeds two.  


I really couldnt put my finger on it but wasnt happy with antipasto board. Big pieces of bread cheese ehh lotsa of olives I think the meats just werent that tasty. wine bar in arcadia is what I compare it to and for about same price much better quality and larger selection. 
But lets focus on what they are known form. 

I have had margherita and SOP(sausage onions peppers mozarella and ricotta) and all have been great experiences. Most recently was the margheriata and added proscuito(italians forgive me for my horrible spelling) . Nice light crust good tomato sauce . generous serving of mozzarella tomatoes and proscuitoo covered the entire pie but not overdone. 

Donuts for dessert are a must powdered sugar and some sugary goodness syrup"}
{"text":"The food here was great! I got the lunch special which fills you up and you have a ton of selections. I got the buffalo chicken pizza and the butternut squash soup.

However, the only problem I had was slightly rude service. Our server worked the outdoor patio and was bald with a beard. It was around 11am and not that busy and since it was our first time there we sat ourselves. We asked if it was ok to sit there and he said it was ok, but was not friendly at all. I also asked him about the soup. Since there were only 2 selections it would have been easy to rattle them off he made  me flip through the menu and read it myself. 

All around was great and it would have been 5 stars if the service was as good as the food."}
{"text":"Some of the best food around. I've never been disappointed when my husband and I select Humble Pie for our date night. We've always been seated almost immediately, the service is very friendly and efficient and the music and atmosphere is always relaxing. My only problem is deciding on what to get, everything is always SO good! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Regardless of which HP I go to, I am happy with the food...except for the chicken wings.  blah.  They're soggy.  But the pizza!  Love them!  as well as the chopped salad."}
{"text":"I really like the food at the out of airport Humble Pie resturants. This air port based location restaurant serves the same delicious food as the non airport stores. 

Being an airport the menu is a limited version of the full resturants offerings.  That said there is plenty of great food to choose from. If your in terminal 4, close to the C gates Humble Pie is worth a try."}
{"text":"We are somewhat regulars. In at least 4-5 times a month.  Great food and staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Very polite folks working here. Beautiful and relaxed ambiance as well. They are really quick with orders, I will tell you that. Busy area but relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eh. I don't know. Very mixed experience here.

Appetizer: Caprese burrata was very bitter, drenched in oil, and was not worth the price. I would definitely skip this.

Pizza: Tried the margherita, which was good. I liked the crust a lot - not too thin, not too thick, and cooked well. Toppings were fresh and nice.

Drinks: Tried some wine and beer. Prices were fine. Selection was fine. Nothing extraordinary.

Ambiance: Once again, fine. This place is probably good if you want to bring kids and/or a large group. Maybe not the most romantic restaurant if that's what you're looking for.

Service: Good. Our server was always attentive and polite.

Overall, I don't think I would ever be in the mood specifically for Humble Pie, but if my first choice restaurant was really busy with a long wait, I think Humble Pie would be a very solid backup that I would be happy to dine at. Given how good the margherita pizza is, I am hopeful the other pizzas are good too."}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice. With all the fantastic reviews, I'm wondering if there is a secret door to a secret location within this location that is only for regulars and friends of workers and management where they get totally different food! Got a Groupon to try it out and forgot to use it the first time. The first time: We ordered carry out. The pizza crust tasted like cardboard and the toppings were a joke. We paid extra for Schreiners sausage and there was about two tablespoons of sausage on that pizza. It was awful. We also ordered cheesy bread and it was alao dried out and pathetic. This was a one star visit for sure. Pizza Hut would have been literally one third of the price and one hundred times better. But, we still had that blasted Groupon. The second time: We ordered a fig and prosciutto pizza and butternut squash soup. The pizza was better, but the soup was reheated baby food. Seriously, where are people leaving four stars getting their food from?!?! They get two stars for the improvement in pizza and cheap beer while waiting."}
{"text":"Nice little spot with a spacious patio when the weather permits. Pizza is wood fired and you can see the chef prepare your food in their ovens. Service has always been attentive and caring and they offer free meals if you have kids."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the lunch combo of pizza and salad. We all had different pizzas, but I liked the meatball the best. The ranch dressing on the salad was great. Seemed homemade."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to send food back usually, but the parm chicken pizza was so bad I did. I chose spaghetti and meatballs as my next try, thinking it would be a reliable choice. Very forgettable and over-priced.

But while I was waiting for that to arrive, I saw a chicken appetizer most would ID as \"wings\" arrive at a neighboring table. I def would have ordered those instead, but too late. I asked the waitress- they are \"drumettes\", only the upper half. My bad. I was hungry to I ordered those too. The sauce was not good. As they cooled off, the sauce congealed, almost like jelly. I brought them home, got that off, and put on some grocery store sauce- 100% improvement.

But on to the feature presentation. I was there for a Cardinals game. They said they \"can't\" play the sound from the game. (!?) The Muzak kept on playing, as I (and about everyone else) left after finishing. The place was about 25% full when I left. Some places just aren't interested in making money I guess."}
{"text":"So last few times I've been back the food has been mediocre. So much so that I don't know when and if and when I'll return , which is unfortunate because I prefer to support local restaurants and Humble Pie is one of the few in the area. This last time I are light and ordered a caprese appetizer which was a joke , it came with to small dabs of fresh mozzarella , pesto , grape tomatoes and a ton of olive oil and balsamic. The dish was surrounded with eight slices of bread to cover the mess. I also ordered meatballs which aren't the best, but not bad. I really hope they pull it together. I really would be sad to see what once was a decent restaurant fade away. We really do need good dining options in the area."}
{"text":"We review fries in Phoenix on our Instagram account, @valleyofthespuds. While it's known for pizza, here's our review of Humble Pie's fries:

\"French Fries: parsley, garlic, lemon zest, pecorino cheese, chili flakes with garlic aioli\"

To the eyes = 9
Served in a standard bowl. Subtle but distinct colors throughout (red, green, white, gold). No-nonsense, generous mountain of fries. Golden brown goodness! Sauce looks slightly unappetizing, but it doesn't disappoint in terms of flavor.

Texture = 9.5
Our favorite aspect of these fries. Near perfect balance of crispy outside and soft inside. Could be slightly thicker. Mostly dry bites (besides the potato) - would be interested to try them with melted cheese, but we're not confident it would be an improvement.

Tastiness = 9.5
The spiciness of the chili flakes is what makes these unique, along with the delicious garlic aioli sauce. Lightly salted, and you likely won't even reach for the ketchup. Toppings concentrated in middle, so could be a little more evenly spread.

Overall Rating = 9.3/10"}
{"text":"Humble Pie gets no respect.

There are quite a few 'marquee' pizza places in the valley...some that come to mind would be Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, The Parlor, Pomo, and Patsy Grimaldis. Ask a random person on Yelp what their favorite pizza place is, and chances are you're gonna hear one of those names mentioned. (This includes us by the way). 

I've never heard anyone say that Humble Pie is their favorite or even in their top three. I wonder why? I could be crazy...but if I was to take a Humble Pie pizza and put it in a taste test with the aforementioned places...I don't think the majority of people would notice a big difference in the level of 'goodness'. Each place has unique flavors, but they're all really damn tasty. Unless you're familiar which how each pie tastes from experience, I think you'd be stumped to identify which came from where. What I'm trying to say is Humble Pie can hang with the big boys. 

So...I'm sitting here wondering now...why don't more people rave about this place...why don't I myself rave about this place?! Could it be something so simple as atmosphere? Humble Pie's interior is very...should I say...humble. There's nothing snazzy or memorable about this place, other than the actual food which is quite good. Cibo is in a quaint old house, Pizzeria Bianco is overflowing with prestige and this aura of greatness from all the national attention...Humble Pie is basically just a storefront with an interior that could have very well been put together by someone who just read 'Interior Design for Dummies'...it doesn't take much chances, and it shows. 

So...what does that leave us with here? 

A pizza place with awesome food, but not much else. I definitely recommend it, but I expect it to continue to hover right below the other more well known places for the foreseeable future. 

3.5/5  (Rounded up to 4 since we ate here on one of our first date nights, and I have fond memories of it.)"}
{"text":"The brushetta board is the best I have had ... better than Postino or Sofritas in Fountain Hills!  I am the brushetta board expert ... and it does not get better than this!"}
{"text":"Humble pie has the best bruschetta  ever. Now, that is me who loves tomatoes. They use cherry tomatoes cut instead of the usual large tomatoes chopped. The cherry tomato is always so much more full in flavor.  No matter what reason or when I am in Humble Pie, I always order this!
Turkey chili and chopped salads are pretty darn good. 
Our service has always been good,  but extra great from the lady who worked closing on Friday nights.  Sorry I cannot remember her name!
Their homemade pepper infused vodka is darn good in a Bloody Mary.
Dining at a table has never looked appealing to me here... But the bar and patio bar seating areas are perfect! And where I prefer to hang out here."}
{"text":"been wanting to try this place for some time now and finally did last Saturday for dinner.

Was pleasantly surprised to find out that they have happy hour daily and not just during the week! 

We started off with the tempura greenbeans with a mustard dipping sauce - very tasty...the kiddo didn't like them, but come on they are green...

we then ordered a plain cheese pizza for the kid and us adults split the pistachio pizza - shaved leeks, red onion, - delish.   The cheese pizza was really good too - the red sauce wasn't too sweet or overloaded.

We rarely save room for dessert, but wanted to try the hot cookie ice cream dessert.   Glad we did - it was tasty....not as good as Oregano's, but a strong second place contender.

The service was good, friendly, and fast.   looks like they do quite a bit of takeout service as well.    the place is small and the tables are cramped - we were able to get a hightop table against the wall, so didn't feel to cramped.  

We will certainly be back - we have our list of what pizza's we want to try next!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch, and sat on the covered patio. I got a red sangria ($5 for happy hour) and the express lunch deal. For $10.95, I got a 10\" artichoke pizza and a half veggie salad. I was really impressed with the salad! It had shredded lettuce, cherry tomatoes, avocado, some delicious cheese chunks, white beans, and probably more that I am forgetting. The pizza was excellent! It was white style with both black and green olives, caramelized onions, and artichoke. The crust was soft and tasty. This was enough to fill me up and I had some left overs. My only complaint is that service was a bit slow..."}
{"text":"Ok they get one star from me because we literally waited 45 minutes for our food. They were short on staff because everyone had quit.....and I know this because the angry bartender kept going on and on about it. We were very patient about the wait until I finally asked the guy why he kept giving all the freshly made pizza to the people coming in and ordering take out. When I mentioned that he brought our pizzas out to us. When we were finished with our meals we had to look for the guy to get our bill and when he finally brought it to us he disappeared again and I had to track him down again to pay and he still didn't return back my card for another 15 minutes."}
{"text":"There is something about Humble Pie that makes my pizza glands moist. I have to think it's the Buffalo Chicken pizza. I crave this pizza daily. From the first time I had it, I may have developed a hormone imbalance that makes me crave it... But oh well, I'm ok with that. 

The appetizers are ok, nothing's special. Salads are decent and the beverages are good. 

They always remember me when I get there and know I need a table for two... For our buffalo chicken pizza. 

The pistachio pizza and the pepperoni are good too... But the bbbbbuiuufffffffaaaaaallllloooooo!"}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of friends.Service was good,food was good,location was good and parking was decent.
Why not more stars?
The price point in my opinion was just a tad high.
I ordered the mac and cheese which was very good,but the portion was on the small side.
My dining companions ordered a myriad of items.Pizza,chili,burger etc.
everyone enjoyed their food.
I should have had the burger though because it came with a mountain of fries.
When I was done with the modest serving of mac and cheese I was still hungry.
So,since we were alarge party,that percentage thing is lopped on top of the bill so my modest meal and soda ended up costing me 20 bucks...
I will go back,but not with a large party and I will try a burger or pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Came here with 4 kids after visiting the aquarium. There were only two tables occupied so we thought, perfect we should get food pretty fast! We were seated and then waited a good 5-10 mins for someone to come take our drink order. Waiter came, we ordered sodas, fries, pizza and a salad. Minutes go by and we finally get our drinks. Then about five mins after that we get a salad and then nothing. The waiter doesn't come back by and no more food comes to the table. Just nothing. After about 40 mins I had to get the waiters attention and ask about our food. He looked dumbfounded and said he didnt know we ordered anything other than the salad. We had 4 kids with us! Why would we only order a salad (which was for the adults) and not feed our kids?! We paid for our drinks and salad and left."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I recommend the Bruschetta with Brie, fig, apples, and honey. Butternut squash soup was also superb. Wish I had a place like this is Cali."}
{"text":"I know it's an airport and I should expect to pay more for food but $18 for a  6 inch average pizza is robbery. They claim their pizzas are 9 inches but we actually laughed when we opened the box and saw how tiny the pizza was.  It looked like a kid's size pizza. We ordered the SOP, but it was mostly just tomato /pizza sauce- very little sausage and I could not find the onions.  Quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"It took us 2 hours to eat here. The service was horribly slow. Took 20 minutes to get my drink, and 15 minutes to crack open a beer. The pizza took well over 40 minutes to get to us, which I semi understood since it is wood fired. Thankfully it was hot and fresh. However, this place gave me food poisoning. Only ate here because it is right next to the aquarium. Do not plan on going back here ever again."}
{"text":"We've been to the Desert Ridge location once before with friends and enjoyed it. I saw the Groupon, noticed the new Peoria location, and thought we should check it out. Our server Matt was super friendly and helpful! It was a bit louder than we were expecting, but the pizzas were very tasty!! The crust was perfectly cooked: thin & crispy on the bottom, with fluffy chewy edges. Yum!  We'll have to come back and check out the patio and try the sandwiches and other pizza options when it cools off a bit."}
{"text":"We entered to see a full dining room but got right in. Service was prompt and friendly. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, a mushroom pizza, large Caesar salad, two iced teas and two waters. Salad was good but only had a few croutons. The pizzas came and this is where it turned for us. The pepperoni pizza was oval shaped and contorted. The mushroom pizza tasted funny. The waiter said it comes with pacetta, green onions and no sauce. This was my mistake. I was looking for a cheese pizza with mushrooms when I ordered a mushroom pizza. Well, they have a bunch of creative pizzas on the menu and mushroom was one of them. The waiter was great about it and had the kitchen make another with sauce and no pancetta. Once we ate the pizza all of us thought we would not come back. The bottom crust is as thin as a tortilla chip. The sauce is plain. The cheese is good though. There really isn't anything great to say for their pretty pricey pizzas. 
And now the weird stuff. The men's restroom is dark. Like make out with a girl dark. The toilet is in a closet. Well, it looks like a closet because it has a full door to it. I have never seen that in a chain restaurant. When I was in it other guys came in and I heard them say they thought it was a closet. There is a round table in the middle of the dining room with plates, parmesan and napkins on it. Is this the waiter counter? When we got our receipt there was no line for a tip and total. Is the tip supposed to be cash only? 
The check came to 50 bucks. Too much for too little. Two stars because the service was good. If you are like us and just want a good basic pie this place isn't for you. If you like thin bread with fancy stuff on top this might work for you."}
{"text":"Love this place. I definitely think we get more bang for our buck during hh than date night but I love that they have different options during the week for deals. My favorite is the pesto pizza but I could live off their fries with aolie! 

Only downside is their options of mixed drinks. I've gotten three different martinis off their menu before and they aren't worth the price. Now I know just to get a glass of wine or their sangria is pretty good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I got taken here for my birthday lunch by coworkers.  The appetizers of zucchini was great and the fried mozzarella outstanding - not too cheesy.  The harvest salad i had was really good and very fresh.  The pazooki for dessert great too."}
{"text":"The crust makes the pizza. This restaurant nailed the crust. Wood-fired oven, fresh ingredients, and unique menu selections make this place one of my favorite restaurants to eat. They a few locations throughout the valley and even a few inside the airport. I fly Southwest a lot, and so terminal 4 and Humble Pie is no stranger to me. I also love the pretzels from here. Pay a little extra, but ask for the brie (you won't regret it)."}

{"text":"Love this place, went for our 1st time yesterday and had the calamari, fried mozzarella and Shrimp pizza. Service was attentive and friendly and the food was delicious and came out fast despite being a busy Sunday. The indoor/outdoor bar is great and the decor was comfortable and welcoming. We'll definitely be back. Oh yeah and Happy Hour on the weekends!!!"}
{"text":"Family event at Odesea and pizza at Humble Pie made sense. Seated quickly and politely. Busy, noise level high with other families and small children. Drinks took 15 minutes. Had to ask to order food. Took about 35 minutes for food to arrive. Orders were correct. Even speed up an order for an small hungry child. Caeser salad was unimaginative and lettece did not appear to be fresh. Pizza was way too salty. Had to ask for refilling iced tea. Two large table near us went unclean for our entire visit. Waiter was excellent; however obviously under staffed the evening we were there. Gave 20% because of him, not the meal. Overall, disappointing."}
{"text":"Not bad at all... pizza was good I had the pesto Chicken 10\"pizza just over $17.00 + soda  came out to $21.00 .... other than cost I was happy... I would like to seeing the price a bit less. But overall it was a good place to eat..."}
{"text":"Left out ingredients of the pizza when there are only 5 total. Way too expensive. Dried chicken to heck my mouth hurts. Gross, sorry. 9 bucks for juice? Seriously? Typical airport trap money maker...."}
{"text":"So many pizza places to.chose from but I come here bc of Paul and Ash! Super friendly and knowledgable! Love the French fries and garlic aoli dip!"}
{"text":"Humble Pie should not be so Humble. LOL
This ex Ny'er  sees why this place has been making a lot of Phx top ten pizza lists lately.

GOOD PIZZA
GOOD PRICES
GOOD SERVICE
NO WAIT
Nice family oriented Scottsdale restaurant. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say expanding on a great thing is not always a great thing. We have eaten at the original Hilton Village location for years when that was all there was. It was great NY style pizza, cheap prices, especially on wine, and very friendly service. Recently they have expanded to, I believe maybe 5 restaurants now? They changed the menu too. I feel they should have stuck with what they knew. The one location or maybe two  and put in the effort with those. 

We ate here at the 83rd Ave location this evening and to be honest it was not the best  experience. 

The good- the fries and asparagus apps were tasty. They were gracious about splitting the check the way we wanted, and my friends say the pizzas were good. I tried the crust which was good but not great.

The bad- The service was just terrible. So much so that we were actually getting angry. The hostess was rude and acted like she did not want our business. Our server was nice, but not around. Our birthday gal pal was left without her meal a good five minutes after we got ours. I think she might have waited longer if I did not flag down another staff member and ask them to check. And finally, what is their Caprese Salad all about? The Mozzarella cheese was the consistency of cottage cheese, which I did not care for at all, the basil/pesto sauce was very bland, and who makes Caprese with cherry tomatoes? You can not cut it or layer it. It was very odd to say the least. And the price of a Caprese salad for what you get is very expensive. I have never paid that much for a salad that small and unflavorful and I have eaten Caprese in tons of restaurants before. 

Finally, the last straw came when gave my friend a small styrofoam box to try to fit her leftovers in. Pizza places should know their business enough that you can not take leftovers in this type of container unless you have one small slice. You should know how to wrap pizza to go if pizza is your business expertise. Very frustrating all around."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is excellent here. We had a bit of a strange incident with the people that were there hanging out....I won't go into detail but this place is not for kids. It would be a great date spot as it's quiet and intimate with low lighting and good music. Food was amazing I would definitely go back for the food and wine and hopefully the crowd won't be so crude and inappropriate."}
{"text":"While we like the food and the resturants setting, the past two visits have been uncomfortable because of our server. She really seems like she hates her job and is not friendly."}
{"text":"This place has only been open for about 5 days and they are still trying to get everything worked out. My son suggested this place, it is close and I like to patronize places in my community. 

When we got there there was several people waiting to get a set. The wait was about 25 min which is not bad. It is fairly small a square room mirrors on one wall two TVs. open bulb string lights over head, concrete floors and as many tables as can be stuffed in this small space. The noise level is about the loudest I have encountered. I don't talk much but like to listen to the others. Only people you could hear was the person beside you or directly across from you. Very hard to carry on a conservation with with the people you are with. About half way through our meal a lot of people had left and it was much easier to talk. 

The service was a little slow but the place was packed. We had come to visit with each other so this just gave us time to talk with one another. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. Once the order was in the food was slow to arrive at the table. One pizza came wrong and one did not arrive and had to be remade. They did not charge for the pizza that did not make it to the table until many had almost finished their meal. 

The food. There was one hamburger ordered. One margarita pizza(the one that did not arrive till late), a cheese pizza, a BBQ chicken w/o onion( came with onion was remade), Caprice sandwich and I had a chopped salad. I did not ask but heard several comments as their pizza and sandwich was good. The sandwich came with a very generous proportion of frys. I had some of these and they were good. My chopped salad was good. Next visit I am going to get the caprice sandwich. It really looked good. 

Our waiter apologized many times for the mix up with the food. It was not an issue for me since I got what I ordered on time. I do know how it feels when everyone is eating and you are just sitting there. 

Final note. Will I return. Yes I will. The food was good and they are new and need to work the kinks out. I started with three stars. I will update when I go back and hopefully their score improves also. If you are in the area or live in the area. Go see them. Support your local business. 

Life is short enjoy yourself eat good food."}
{"text":"I had been meaning for a while to this place out and finally did since it is hard to pass up The Main Ingredient. I wish I hadn't as not more than 50 feet from where I sat people where most likely enjoying some awesome appetizers and good food for way less.

I tried the wings which had an odd taste but were so so. The antipasto board was terrible and for 11$ should have had a little effort to it. The food came slow as well as the service was slow and inattentive. The lady we had seemed to not be thinking about the place since we had to request a pizza to go 3 times she came back out from the back. I must note that at the time there were 2 people at the bar and one other couple in the whole place. The steak and turkey chili was pretty bad also. 

 I am not a fan of pizza much besides maybe Red Devil or the now closed Western Pizza but I live with 3 females that are and not one of them cared for it. The bread was good but the sauce had the hint of toothpaste( probably from too much tomato paste) that peter piper seems to have in their equally terrible pizza. 

 I can't say I will be back, I think my girl liked the martini she had but she will have to go alone if she wants another.

I would mention that just like a terrible steak house or a Chili's you will pay more than you should for sub par dining. I don't mind paying well for good food but you can't help feeling like you have been ripped off when you have a larger than average bill for crappy food."}
{"text":"Ate here and really enjoyed their pizza. I would put it on the the level of The Parlor, LGO and Spinato's. 

Don't think you can go wrong, when you order your pizza it is about a 12 inch round and could be shared or eaten by one.

They do have specials every once in a while and there are a few locations around town.

This location is newer and the decor and atmosphere is clean and vibrant.

The service is very good and always there around your table and especially very friendly. 

Had the meat lovers pizza which had pepperoni,  sausage and meatballs which was very tasty. It is a thin crust which is very good and was cooked just right.

The price is on the higher side for a 12 inch pizza which runs between $10 - $15.

Will come back again to try different combinations but will keep an eye on any discounts."}
{"text":"Horrible Service

Got there at 5:30 am and was to board at 5:40 am

Worker said not open for another 3 minutes, when I asked how long it would take if I ordered 2 breakfast meals the person said 15 minutes. Appearantly she did not want to sell anything. I understand it is early but her attitude was horrible."}
{"text":"Order: Humble Pie Breakfast (two eggs, breakfast potatoes, toast and bacon or sausage). I got scrambled eggs and bacon. $7.50 + tax.

Food: Eggs were angular and looked waxy, like they were instant eggs but made in a pan. I got a corner edge so there was a hard, darker egg part that I could not eat. Toast wasn't toasted. Bacon was good. Sausage was acceptable.

Staff: Excellent and quick (in and out in about 10 minutes).

Overall: They should stick to pizza but they'll get everything out quickly."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday early afternoon for lunch. They had a lunch special with a 12\" pizza along with soup or salad for $10.95. It's a great deal and actually I had leftover pizza. The chopped salad was delicious with salami & turkey and an herb vinaigrette. We also ordered the tomato bruschetta. The bread was amazing. The buffalo mozzarella was good, but a little bland and creamed. Balsamic vinegar and tomatoes were perfect with a little basil too.  I ordered the meat lovers pizza and it was very good. The sauce and crust were cooked perfectly. The service was awesome, very attentive. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Our neighbors suggested going to this restaurant on Saturday night, our first time there. The atmosphere was great, we sat on the patio. Our server was also one of the managers, and he was able to give us quite a bit of information about the restaurant and what is being served. He had a good knowledge of beers and made great suggestions for the table. There were 4 of us and each one ordered a different pizza so we could try them. The Buffalo Chicken and the S.O.P. were the best, and the Grilled Chicken Pesto was also good, but the Fig & Prosciutto did not have a lot of flavor to it. There are other pizzas that also look good and will try them in the future. The service was excellent, the food was great, the beer was awesome, and the atmosphere was perfect. I highly recommend this location to everyone that enjoys this type of food!"}
{"text":"Service was stellar, happy hour prices were great, glad to have a good spot in ocotillo"}
{"text":"Tried the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad here. Quite sweet as warned by the waitress. Candied pecans were good, but it was a little overdoused in champagne vinaigrette. The outdoor patio was pleasant as was the service and bathrooms. Food was just OK in my book though."}
{"text":"I woke up on the wrong side of/under the bed this morning for an insanely early flight. During my layover in Phoenix, I stopped at Humble Pie for a drink. Ginger and Maryanne are hilarious, fast and friendly. Food, drinks, comedy!!! I highly recommend this watering hole!"}
{"text":"A cross between eclectic pizza and usual/commercialized pizza... and it's just right... ingredients are fresh and pizza has a thin crust so it doesn't fill you up on bread... the salads are wonderful and should definitely be tried. Bar selections are a little slim but at least they have made an effort. Pizzas tend to be a little 'crispy' ask for a 'light cook' if you prefer your pizza to not 'crunch'.... very accommodating and staff does a good job. Casual atmosphere and parking is relatively easy..."}
