{"text":"Maybe is one of my favorite restaurants near ASU campus, dishes include cuisines from Chinese, American, and Italian. I only tried Chinese cuisine there, and they taste great, it's really close to real Chinese cuisine, really recommend you guys to try this restaurant, maybe it is the best Chinese restaurant near ASU! Btw, almost all Chinese food I have tried there taste great!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Dollar beers. Great stir fry. Sweet and sour chicken is my favorite so far. Try the skewers and hot pot if you have a big group."}
{"text":"I love this place.  DELICIOUS food.  I absolutely love the curry bowl. And the meat skewers are pretty cheap for lunch.  Friendly staff, and they have a giant spoon and fork on the wall for some reason that i find funny every time i see it, so kudos on that too.  I like to laugh!  And as a bonus PBR's are like a $1."}
{"text":"Green Tea Shakes and the Braised Beef Potato Rice are my favorites! Gluttons sauce beef is spicy and yummy, but it was too salty for my second try. The waitress and waiter are really nice and sweet! After I talked to a waitress, she gave me a new dish and it tasted much better! love the dessert here~~~highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous.  The service was awesome.  Exactly what we were looking for, great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The service was slow, we waited an hour for our food, and when it came it was cold, the buns were stale. One member of my party ordered extra tomatoes, but there were no tomatoes on his burger.  Another member of my party was supposed to get a hard boiled egg, but didn't receive it.  No soda fountain, and they charge a $1.25 for a 12oz can of soda.  The fries were cold, tasted stale.  Overpriced.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"No no no no no no no no.  Overpriced, under-seasoned food and a rude waitstaff to go with it.   I only interacted with one member of the staff, who seemed annoyed that we showed up (it was 3 hours till closing). He had a bad attitude and pretended to know more about the food than he actually did.   The ONLY decent thing about this place is $1 16oz PBRs.   I am not interested in going here again, even though it's open late. I'd rather go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"The hot pot and spicy port sauce noodle are my favourite dish in the restaurant!!!! If you are over 21, I will definitely recommend the special cocktail mixed with fresh smoothies, that is the best low alcol drink I ever had!!  And there is good grean tea shake for the fan of green tea icecream.  The dessert is also fantasic amazing,especially the banana slamma, they also have the special chocalate mix chipotle one.  Worth to try it!!!"}
{"text":"I had red curry vegetables at Gluttons tonight and specifically mentioned that I wanted it mild. The dish was so spicy that it was impossible to eat. I told this to the waitress who took it back to fix it. Nothing changed and I had to leave the entire dish uneaten. I also had to order an ice-cream sundae to soothe the burning. So I wasted $7.99+$4.99 and still had to go somewhere else to eat. I am never going back.  If you are not a fan of too much spice, I would recommend avoiding this place.   I miss the thai restaurant that was here before. They had friendly staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"an ideal hangout place. This place is best enjoyed coming for skewers and drinks.   the skewers are flavored amazingly. At just around $1 each it's hard to find a better deal for a small bite and you get to try many it's like Asian tapas. The drinks are very reasonable here too this is the perfect place to start your night or just come for a quick bite.  The food is delicious again very well spiced and massive portions for the size, but does take quite a while to cook. I can't get enough of it, but I also have Americanized tastes so to each is own. As much as I like the food though I highly recommend you try the skewers option and come here for a quick bite.   The ambience is nice and welcoming and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and I have to say, if there are low reviews it's because many Americans don't understand that legitimate authentic Chinese food is not what they serve at Panda Express. If you are looking for that kind of food, don't come to Gluttons. If you want a huge serving of great food though, this is exactly right. I love the atmosphere, it's simple and cozy. I had the sweet and sour chicken, my friend had the orange chicken, and we shared dumplings. Next time I'm going to try a beef curry. It's so close to campus and has wifi- I'm going to be there a lot in the future!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the total quality of the food and service.  I called in, stressed out in the middle of final exams and starving.  Thankfully I got Ryan (owner) on the phone.  I simply asked him to make and deliver his favorite dish.  He asked my budget and tastes (yesssss.. I love spicy food and smoothies) and enjoyed a spicy pork dish over rice with a fried egg and strawberry banana AVOCADO smoothie.  I recommend Gluttons for many reasons...  1. Quality of food- huge portions with excellent ingredients 2. Quality of service- delivery driver was running a bit behind, so to get me the order on time the owner dropped it off.  Nicely done, I shall return!!  PS, they specialize in skewers and many other items.  Check out the menu!"}
{"text":"This is a rather new (or renamed/redesigned) place, so I was interested to try it. The decor is new and clean looking. The staff members were a bit quiet, but did a good job. The prices were decent, but the portions and food were not.  The skewers cost $2 each and came with almost no meat on them. Some of the pieces were 100% fat. However, the spice rub showed promise and the lamb skewer had pretty good flavor.   The chicken rice came with what seemed to be plain microwave-quality white rice. The chicken, while in nice white meat pieces, was completely flavorless and had thick fatty skin atop it. The sweet chili sauce was obviously out of the same bottle that can be purchased at the supermarket.   Although there was nothing particularly bad about the visit, there was nothing remarkable either. Overall, the food was extremely bland and did not make me want to come back."}
{"text":"When it comes to skewers, I'm pretty expert on it. I tried some and they were deep fried and masked with seasoning. How unfortunate. I also ordered the pork feet to see how it stacked up to other great Chinese places I been to. It's almost there... but not quite.  The decorations and staff were nice. But the food could have been better. The pork feet was braised pretty well but the sauce lacked the taste and punch I would expect from an \"authentic Chinese restaurant.\" It's something you can't describe but you know it when you experience it. The rice was kinda hard.   I ate the spicy and sweet chicken with rice too. It was neither spicy nor sweet. But the rice was hard like the rice on my plate. SO at least that's consistent.  If you are looking for some random food to eat and $1 PBR beer, then this may be the place for you. Random as in chicken gizzards, etc. on a stick, and like pork feet. Not too many places serve those items. I just wish they did them well instead of mediocre.  Steak and Shake just opened down the street on Mill. Probably better to walk 5 minutes, get some cheaper and better tasting food."}
{"text":"Glutton. \"a:  one given habitually to greedy and voracious eating and drinking  b :  one that has a great capacity for accepting or enduring something 'a glutton for punishment' \"  Not only is this a very strange name for a Chinese establishment, but the name almost kicks itself in the a** by not only making the place sounds so good that you would want to voraciously eat and drink there, but secondly miserably fails and turns into the latter translation for great capacity for accepting or 'enduring something'.  On a positive note, the place is very clean, boasts high ceilings, and provides a modern and welcoming atmosphere with splashes of Chinese decor.  I am glad I started with a margarita. Albeit the industrial sized pre mixed sweet and sour behind the counter with some extra shots of cheap tequila, but it helped me wash what was to come down much quicker and with a smile on my face.  With a selection of eats such as stir fry, skewers, curry, and traditional selections such as kung pao I opted for an appetizer of coconut shrimp and orange chicken as my main.  The coconut shrimp was only passable because of the garlic chili sauce it came with for dipping.  Shrimp was on the dry side, the coconut batter too deep fried to have any distinct flavor or personality.  The portion of Orange Chicken was so behemoth I could have fed a family of four, and perhaps that is where this restaurant's concept kicks in...but I prefer quality over quantity and only ate this dish as long as the garlic-chili sauce from the shrimp held out.  Completely flavorless, the chicken tasted like something out of a bag of boiled poultry, deep fried as an afterthought and doused in a lackluster orange glaze.  While paying at the counter the chef/cook happened to ask how it was and all I could say was \"it was okay.\"  And with an earnest repeat of the question, I could only reply with the same....at which point he walked away with a look of disdain instead of asking me what could have made it better.  But that's the difference between fine dining and college food, right?  If you lack tastebuds, or are so hungry you could eat a horse and just don't care how it tastes, this is your spot.  Didn't think my meal and drink were worth $20 (so thank you Groupon for only making me pay $10), but I do have to say the staff was very nice and attentive to customers and upkeep of the dining room - I wished I had enjoyed the food more because I liked the atmosphere and staff.  But yea, I have experienced much better and am not a \"glutton\" for punishment."}
{"text":"I like the pig feet! And the place is so cool. Perfect price for a good taste Chinese Lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch since it is close to work. The food was great and the staff was friendly. The portions were substantial and I didn't even feel too hungry an hour later. The best part? It isn't too much more expensive than Panda Express that is close by but the quality of food is much better.... as one would hope from an actual sit down Chinese food restaurant.   Definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"Chinese street food. It's an acquired taste but I love this."}
{"text":"I'm sick and wanted some soup Left class and came to Gluttons because I've always wanted to see what it's about The servers are nice Two girls in here right now pretty much doing everything The interior is pretty clean and minimal...  I love the paper lanterns   The one server who seated me offered me water and gave me some tips on soup  I chose the braised beef noodle with soup After her suggestions  I was very into the tv show that was on today in the dining area haha the wait for the soup was about 10 minutes but it was pretty busy and I was occupied by the show, idk what the show is  The soup is really good The noodles are nice and thick and not too soft, I'm not big on noodles that get too soft especially in soups  The broth is great and very spicy Perfect for this sickness :(  The meat is seasoned well and it's not too soft but not too tough  Honestly I had some low expectations for this soup but it has changed my mind  I will for sure be back, soup is good, service is good and the crowd is pretty diverse which I like"}
{"text":"We came here for the hot pot! I left wishing we ordered the other items on the menu however.   The Hotpot was pretty oily and consisted of mostly noodles and a few morsels of things we added into it. Just know that if you order noodles with your hotpot they give you a ton so try not to order more then two sides for one bowl.   The chicken and bean curd skewers were 100x better though I would have liked more per serving.   The other dishes on the menu looked a lot better as I looked at the tables around me near the end of the meal. The main menu looks like your standard Chinese American fare but they had dishes that looked quite enticing like the braised pork and curry katsu.   Also got the Chinese Pear drink which tasted like the syrupy version of the Korean Sac Sac Pear and ironically contains no pear juice :'(  NEXT TIME I COME WITH MAINLAND FRIENDS WHO KNOW WHAT TO GET"}
{"text":"Delicious good food and service! Our party had the braised short ribs, kungpao chicken, and beef noodle soup! Man oh man were those short ribs a hit! At only 6.99 for a salad, ribs, and a helping of rice, it was a stellar deal! I'm so hungry thinking about it!!!!   The water service was definitely top 3. Our server, a very friendly and genuine college junior, was so on top of serving us refreshing h20. Every time we looked at our cup, it was never empty as she came ever so often to pour water after even leaving the pitcher on the table. We were either spoiled or I love water so much and drink so much liquid that I appreciate the splendid service.   My order was the best decision out of the three as my friend kept picking on my food! It was irresistible and I didn't mind sharing because it was that good!  I would love to come back here for heart affordable food and service!   They were also quick, clean, and surprisingly not so busy. We did come on lunch hour on a Saturday so students were probably away from their weekday routine. It was a nice relaxing weekend lunch for us!"}
{"text":"I really liked Gluttons when I went there. After spending a year in China, it's nice to have a local place that serves some Chinese food that is more similar to what I had in China. They have Chinese bbq, which isn't quite the same as what I had all over China, but it's closer than anything I've had here in Tempe.  I also liked the interior. It's decorated nicer than the average Chinese restaurant.  All considering, I think they're trying to do something different than the average hole in the wall pseudo-Chinese place. I appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago, we saw the Groupon and thought to check it out.  The place is nice, small and welcoming. We came in around dinner time, middle of the week and when we arrived, I thought the place can't be bad, everyone eating was asian(real asian) so we were quite excited.  The service was a bit slow due to the dinner service, but I didn't mind $1 PBR's while we waited.  The owner came out and spoke to us, I had forgotten I had on a Detroit hat, he approached and spoke to us for a bit and to let me know he was also a Motor City native and was glad we stopped in.  For dinner we had the dumplings, ribs and some spicy a** soup I couldn't even finish, not even when I got home.  Overall it was good for the price, maybe better advertising will help this place. I liked it and will return."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend because of the groupon and really enjoyed my experience here. We ordered a stir fry of Mongolian Beef, order of eggrolls and two skewers (bacon and musroom, squid)  Pricewise I found that this place is really cheap, especially with how good the food was. I really enjoyed the mongolian beef, that I even ate the onions that came with it (not a big onion guy). My friend really enjoyed the eggrolls, enough to make sure to tell me to mention it in my review.   I'd definitely check it out. The service was really good, our servers name (can't remember it) checked up on us frequently but not too frequently and had several suggestions for what we should get.   I'd definitely go again if I was on that side of town."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever eaten.   Dumplings were similar to the frozen ones you can buy at Costco and were deep fried... Crunchy and flavorless. I had a Groupon and the picture of the dumplings on that page were nothing like what we got. ($5)  Sliced beef noodle soup- 6 slices of low quality beef and raw cabbage in a bowl with overcooked soggy noodles. The beef was almost chalky in consistency. ($8)  Pork feet over rice- Flavorless and bland. This is Chinese comfort food that needs to be slow cooked and that obviously didn't happen. The skin didn't absorb any flavor. The sauce was basically pure starch mixed with soy sauce.There were still hairs that hadn't been burnt off or removed. ($7)  Chicken gizzard skewer- 1 or 2 gizzards filleted and spread on a skewer then grilled. Topped with a good amount of msg... ($1)  We didn't even want to finish our food and the table across from us also left a large amount before leaving.    Maybe a better place if you are drinking. But without beer goggles STAY FAR FAR AWAY!"}
{"text":"The dumpling feels like store bought instead of making from scratch since I know how Chinese restaurant operates these days.  The service was subpar since she brought the food without any utensils so we had to sit there and let the food get cold (THIS IS A NO-NO in CHINESE restaurant where WOK-KEE is very important where the food is suppose to be steamy hot when it is being served out of the kitchen and real foodie will sit right next to the Kitchen to be served just like sushi table) and we had to wait for over 5 minutes while food on the table sits and get cold and give I her a blank stare and signaled that I will have to eat this with my bare hands.  She apologized by giving me one dish for free (I didn't expect that) which made it up.  The noodle soup was very full flavored (on salty side) but that is how the Northern Chinese like it so there is no question of authenticity there and it is verified by all the Chinese patrons present.  The owner need to train the waitstaff on setting priorities who was totally lacking from a trained eyes (I was a restaurant owners/manager from mom and pop to a five star restaurant in Beverly Hills).  Since we were served by four different people so I don't even know who actually served us.  I will now only return on off hours to ensure proper service.  It is a fun place with full bar and live TV playing sports so it is a cool place to hang out with friends after class."}
