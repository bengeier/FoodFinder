{"text":"Used to be my family's go to place. Solid food and price, one of the best hot and sour soups in the city in my option. Overall the food is very consistent and good, staff are relatively friendly. Only reason I give 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because I have a peanut allergy and sometimes they give a hard time with accommodating. Depends on the server though."}
{"text":"Really no value! Skip it! They open the doors at 11 a.m. but are totally unprepared.

The fried noodles sat in a pool of water the sauce was runny, the pork was not BBQ pork but plain unseasoned pork with a bit of red food color.

Initially mom was happy that she got shrimp dumplings in her noodle soup, until she tasted them - they were not fresh.

I ordered pork dumplings with peanut sauce (supposed to be spicy - not) it was simply pureed peanut-butter - no seasoning sweet?

Despite the place only having 7 patrons and 2 servers the service was slow.

You know I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Service is top notch, and food is also very good. I've been looking for this type of Chinese food since moving here.  It's a little bit pricey but it's really tasty and good."}
{"text":"Had wonton soup and ginger and shallot chicken. Very tasty. Very clean restaurant. Service quick."}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times for take-out, and the food has been pretty solid, pretty much what you'd expect from a slightly above average Chinese restaurant. This place seems relatively busy whenever I go, mostly locals or people that work nearby. The space is huge and the tablecloths are actually layers of disposable plastic (think cut-out garbage bags) that make it easier for the tables to get bussed quickly, which as a former bus boy I can respect :). If you're Filipino like me, you might get a \"kumusta ka\" from the staff here, a nice local touch in an area with a lot of Filipino foot traffic. Today we ate in and tried the lunch special, not that extensive of a menu but had many of the basics one would like. I went for the General Tsao chicken. You can choose your sides (I chose fried rice and dumpling soup, respectively). It came out to around 10 bucks, the portions were pretty big, and I had no complaints. Even the dumpling soup was light and tasty."}
{"text":"The best Peking Hot Soup (hot and sour) I've ever had.  This location was related to the one on Cote-des-Neiges originally, so it's all the same recipes - but it's generally more convenient for my family. 
What can I recommend besides the soup? The General Tao chicken is also probably the best in the city. There are larger pieces of chicken with a sauce that must contain the same addictive element as their soup. To be honest I've tried a good portion of their dishes over the years - and I've never had a bad one, maybe not something I'm really into but nothing bad. 
If you eat there the portions are rather large, you'll probably have enough to take home."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurant located next to metro Plamondon. As an asian, eating in a asian restaurant where there was only caucasian people knowing each other felt pretty intimidating. Food was decent, but portions are not generous for the price. Their duck is pretty good, but same problem with the small portion. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Solid Good Chinese Food.  Our first night in Montreal and this restaurant was just around the corner from our AirBNB.  Wonderful food.  We had the MuShu Pork, Candied Ginger and Pineapple Chicken (Actually pickled ginger), Beef and Broccoli, Shrimp and Snow peas, and wonton soup.  

Everything was solidly tasty and enjoyed by our four boys (10/8/5/3). The waiter was especially good with kids.

It was pretty clear that they tailor to different ethnicities.  We were brought silverware, while the Chinese table next to us had chopsticks.

Clean and comfortable and yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered for take out: 2 egg rolls, general tso chicken and fried noodles with chicken and beef. We were extremely disappointed and would not go back.

The take-out is served in Chinese takeout boxes so the sauce completely sops through and makes a huge mess. The food was honestly pretty gross. The general tso had almost no chicken and was just fried dough for the most part. When we opened the box, the chicken at the top had no sauce and just looked like fried chicken. I think they put a ton of sauce at the bottom and then just throw the chicken on top. This resulted in the bottom half becoming incredibly soggy. Overall inedible. The noodle dish wasn't any better...it was salty to the point that it felt like I was eating straight up salt. The egg rolls were average but shined in comparison.

They have no combos deals whatsoever which is unusual for a Chinese restaurant. The value is simply not there. Over 35$ for a meal that left us completely disappointed."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place. Whenever my parents are in town, we have to go to Kam Shing. Service is really good and the food as well for the price. They do a lot of take out too. It's a staple in CDN."}
