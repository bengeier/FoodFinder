{"text":"Bright, fresh, and friendly, and open 7 days from early am. Very happy to have this bakery in my neighborhood! Typical Mexican bakery service, with tongs and your own tray. You will leave happy, fine to take your treasures and eat in the park across the street."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Mexican bakery to satisfy a Pan Dulce craving. On a whim, we found this place and drove down to check it out when we found out that La Purisima was closed on Monday. We were glad to have found San Sebastian and the sweets did not disappoint. On our tray, we pulled a fresh as can be Concha, churro, and a couple of cookies. Everything was excellent and the concha was one of the best I have eaten. I have had Pan Dulce from Chicago to LA and can say that San Sebastian is a top notch choice when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place for me was not consider a 5 star reasons for that was the variety for  pan dulce was so little that's was a major and only issue had"}
{"text":"A small Mexican bakery that has extremely good pan dulce (sweet chewy bread bun with a sugary crust).  In fact, it was the best I have ever had, and the main reason I am giving this place four stars!  It was buttery, chewy, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and not too sweet.  The sugary crust on top (I chose the white one, which I think is the one without any food coloring) was not as sweet as frosting or icing, but just right.    I also tried a puffed pastry horn filled with vanilla custard (though the bottom tip was empty) and covered in crystalline rock sugar.  It was fine, but not as fresh tasting as the pan dulce.  The puffed pastry tasted pre-made, or maybe I just missed the buttery-flakiness of the pan dulce?  The sugar on the outside was a nice touch though.  I also tried a muffin-like item covered in sesame seeds that the baker's son said had sour cream and cheese mixed in, but it was rather plain.  That one tasted very fresh though (it was actually on a cooling tray on the cases), and was just sweet enough.  Cost of all three items?  Under $2.50!  Which is also influencing the four star rating positively.  They do accept credit/debit cards according to the sticker on their door, but I didn't want to deal with any minimum charges or fees or anything...  They also carried a few more conventional baked goods, like donuts and gigantic cookies.  The son of the owner/baker helped me out, providing information on everything I asked about.  Nothing has a sign, label, or price tag though, so I would be completely lost without an English-speaking cashier.  It's apparently part self-serve, and there are tongs on one of the bakery cases, which I was told to use myself and place my chosen items in the paper bag the baker's son held for me.  Note that the sign above the door reads: \"Bakery Panaderia Y Pasteleria San Sebastian\" and they have a giant \"Now Opening Bakery\" banner above the door too.  They are located in the tiny strip center next to the gas station, across from the park and a bit north of the bowling alley."}
{"text":"Not only are they the best panderia in town, they're also very kind and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican pan dulce. You have to go to Pan & Pasteleria San Sebastian. They have fresh sweet Mexican bread daily, and make custom order cakes. This small bakery has a HUGE variety of pan dulce. My family and I always make sure to come every Sunday, as they are open 7 days a week until 9pm. Make sure to grab some \"conchas and ginger puerquitos\" as they do not compare to any pan dulce around the valley."}
{"text":"Love coming here for my sweet bread. They always have it fresh and great prices for it as well. I have order cakes as well and they always come out delicious. Definitely the best Mexican bread ever I choose this place over any other place anytime. I took a brief picture of some of the bread they have."}
