{"text":"Go for lunch once or twice a month and will continue to do so.  Food is great as is the service.  Thanks Feathers!!"}
{"text":"Things are slipping....  I'm wondering if Feathers' long success is affecting their attention to detail. I've eaten at feathers at least 75 times in the past five years - It has always been our neighbourhood pub of choice.  Sure, food service has always been a little slow but its a pub. Who's in a hurry? If you have a pint you can wait and converse.  Last night I and 2 fellow diners arrived for our meal sat a table in a largely empty restaurant and waited. No drinks, no food. One waitress was on the phone and the bartender stood at a table near the front and talked with 2 customers. After about 10-15 minutes we left and ate elsewhere.   To be honest, due to location we will probably return at some point but it will be a long time before Feathers is our pub of choice."}
{"text":"Great pub.  Great pub food.  I love the kippers, wings, salads, shepherd's pie, and pretty much everything on the menu.  A classic landmark in the upper beach on interesting Kingston Rd."}
{"text":"friendly atmosphere and classy people top food served by restaurant staff that are nice and friendly reasonably priced food and beverages I recommend it !!!"}
{"text":"Been going to Feathers for a real long time now. Never had a bad meal and had many a fine ale there."}
{"text":"This place is a neighbor pub where people of all ages go.  Amazing selection of Scotch whiskey!  The tap is not bad at all too.  As for food, we were very happy with what we ordered.  Mussels and wings are a must.  The service has always been great.  A lot of smiles!"}
{"text":"This place was hopping for a Saturday night, we waited for at least half an hour for a table that could seat seven of us.  They had a live band playing popular scottish folk songs, as it was Bobby Burns night, a little bit on the loud side in there, but enjoyable none the less. They have a wide selection of scotch to choose from to suite your persnal taste, like The Glenlivet, if you prefer your scotch to be served neat or on the rocks, or a simple house scotch for the less bold who prefer scotch and water.  Note, the higher the age of the scotch, the more money you'll be paying.  They also have excellent beer on tap, such as Innis &Gunn.  I will definately go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely cozy traditional British pub with diverse menu including a very tasty brunch on weekends!  Staff are very friendly, and lots of welcoming locals from the area."}
{"text":"First time in there in Oct. 2014. Great service, very helpful, very good selection of beers and especially whiskey. I didn't expect the food to be as good as it was.  Nicely presented, good atmosphere. Can only recommend this place."}
{"text":"Feather's is probably the best pub in the Upper Beach area. Amazing Scotch collection, great beers on tap, and good pub fare, like cottage pie, Welsh rarebit and Cornish pasty (my fave). Kid-friendly area in the back, and drinkin-friendly up front."}
{"text":"Beer wise. This place is the best in Toronto. They always have a delicious cask on tap and have dozens of great local ales and imports from the UK. The decor is dated but does feel like a jaunt to the past. Because of this and the neighbourhood, I am often the youngest person in the joint and the only one without grey hair (aside from the friendly bar staff).  Food is fairly good and cheap. Very much english pub fare. But I go here for the beer, not the food although the shepherd pie and meatloaf are both yum!"}
{"text":"Dropped in with a bunch of friends to celebrate \"Robbie Burns Day\". Once the door was opened, you were serenaded with guitar, lyrics, a fiddle and guests dancing a jig all in honour of Mr.Burns! My kind of pub, considering my heritage backround, I felt right at home. Yes, they do occasionally have live bands here, but mostly it seems that the only real entertainment you need are good friends, the atmosphere of the pub will take care of the rest! Their selection of whiskeys is phenomenal and endless, there is NO WAY you would be able to sample them in an evening, Let alone a week, possibly a month, SERIOUSLY! The menu looks like a great selection of foods, both finger and entree. The interior is not huge,but lined with RED PUFFY cushioned benches with wood tables in front and your normal bar in which is adorned with the USUAL customers. The bathrooms were in good state, kept clean, but not huge. Overall, I was very happy, comfortable and at home, we'll definitely be back no matter what the celebration is for, even just for ourselves!"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch with my love there.  Nice & quiet, on a Sunday morning at least.  Brunch Menu was well populated. I had a Western Sammy and wife had French Toast. Both were well above average. My coffee was decent and refilled several times, her orange juice was....juicy.  As our relaxed morning moved along it did start to fill up inside, mostly with an interesting mix of older British seniors out for their weekly tomato juice and some regulars looking for some hair of the dog.  Food was good, place was clean and quiet. I dont need much more for brunch.  Regular menu looked nice as well. They have a daily soup, quiche and flatbread special for those interested"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pint, eat consistently delicious pub food, and have a chat with a mate. Closest thing I've found to a real English pub in Toronto. Also, their extensive collection of whiskies and scotch is.. well, extensive."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place.  It had an old style pub feel.  However the service was the worst, due to serious under staffing.  The bartender (server) would not give you the time of day. A cook and a bartender for a full pub.  The beer and wine were great.  The cottage pie was extremely dry.  The side salad with the cottage pie was bitter.  The Mac and Cheese was really great.  The side ceasar was very good with light dressing.  Garlic bread was also good.  All and all I would have given the place three and a half stars but the service was the worst.  Can we get the check?"}
{"text":"Second trip to the Beaches area in a couple of months and this is the best pub yet! Service was exceptional, Food was terrific had the mussels for an appetizer and they were obviously cooked by a chef who knows how to prepare them. Their home brewed Feathers Red is actually better than the Killians  I normally drink in the states. Will be stopping back in when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Great British pub with traditional fare.  It gets very busy and a little crowded on the weekends as there is usually a band.  Sticky toffee pudding is great.  I've heard they have the largest scotch or whiskey collection in North America."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Feathers for over 10 years. It was better run under the former management who were more knowledgeable and hands on in their approach to good customer service. Last night we once again attempted wing night.I had quiche and my partner wanted wings. After over an hour wait the food was delivered with no cutlery, condiments etc. One poor server was run off her feet. As usual the new captain as Reid wants to be called was nowhere to be seen. The last 3 visits have had the same poor results. I can understand the frugal idea of running a shop, but not at the expense of customer service.Oh yes. The wings were scrawny and the quiche had seen better days. Last visit for me."}
{"text":"Feathers Pub has become known as one of the finest single-malt whisky bars in the world. They have an extensive list of fine spirits, with much of it on display in a showcase near the entrance and behind the bar.  The decor reminds me of CBC's Coronation Street or somebody's grandmother's living room in England. This is what I imagine a traditional English Pub looks like. It sets the scene for some fine Scotch tasting. That's my impression anyway.  Our party of four went there for the whisky and there were pages and pages of choices, as well as flights (prix-fixe choices). Where do we begin?  I chose the Islands Flight for $35 that had 5 half ounce shots of whiskies from the British Isles.   It included a Talisker 10yr old, Bowmore Dawn, Ardbeg, 10yr old, and offerings from Arran and  Jura. The ones that I found listed on LCBO's site go for around $100/bottle. They were mostly good, with flavours ranging from peat (Talisker) to very smokey (Ardbeg).  One of my companions had the Feathers Flight for $75. It included more premium selections, aged up to 27 years. He was quite pleased.  The other two in our party were more selective, ordering individual shots, including a Glenfiddich 30yo ($44.99/1oz) and a Kavalan Port Finish from Taiwan. Unfortunately, the Glenfiddich was a little underwhelming (for the price).  Their food menu includes most of the usual pub grub favourites and more traditional British entrees. This visit, however, was all about the whisky. Their selection is certainly the biggest I've seen. I did have to deduct a point from the rating because 3 of the samples had bits of cork in the glass. Maybe they should replace the corks with more modern bottle stoppers or pour through a strainer."}
{"text":"I agree.  Beer wise there's little competition around.  That's about all they have going for them.  If you want good food, good service and management that cares, this pub is not impressive. Basically the regular clientele run the show.  I gave it a chance.  Feathers is a fail."}
{"text":"This very British feeling pub has consistently impressed me with their food. It can be rather busy though and service can be a bit slow then, but one of my favourite places on Kingston. Draws a bit of an older crowd, but that's not a bad thing.  I just wish they would some more seasoning, salt even, to the gravy."}
{"text":"I would never expect I can find something like The Feathers Pub in this area.  Over 400 Single Malts from over 100 distilleries! I don't think I can really make up my mind what to order! But they do have Feature flights ($65) that changes monthly or you can just pick one of the Whisky tours from $25.  Imports and Local Craft Beer! Their House Beers are Feather's Lager and Feather's Red brewed by Great Lakes Breweries. Black Oak and Cheshire Valley's beers also available on taps!   We ended up coming here during Robbie Burns Day and the place was packed. The crowd was friendly and having a good time dancing to the lively music from the live performance. Do check their website for the most updated information as you might prefer coming on a quieter night if you want to enjoy your flight tasting and talk to the staff about single malts.  The Feathers Pub is a awesome pub if you want to come chill with friends and sip on some whiskies!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Feathers twice in the past and each time it has been absolutely lovely! The Feathers is an old school Scottish Pub with a good variety menu and an even bigger scotch whisky menu that you can always find something new and delicious to try every time you come here! I've had the fish and chips which is one of my favourites in the city and the half rack of ribs and fries lunch special was a great value for nicely seasoned ribs and homemade fries! But the reason to come here is for the whisky. They have everything from Glenmorangie 10 Year Old 100 Proof to a 20 year old Port Ellen, the variety and the welcoming nature from the staff is great for new drinkers and whisky connoisseurs alike! Definitely give these guys a try if your ever nearby, if you love a good single malt scotch you'd be crazy not to!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Liver & Onions and that's a rare dish these days, hard to cook, and it was excellent. The portion was generous, and the meat was cooked to perfection. I paired it with the perfect ale. HOWEVER, because I was driving I asked for a soda water afterwards, and was kinda disgusted to see it was $3 on the bill. Now I know you think I'm a cheap skate, but listen..  I eat dinner and drink beers (and soda water) a lot at  west end bars like Drake, Gladstone and Cadillac and Rhino and NOT ONCE HAVE I EVER PAID FOR SODA WATER after a meal. Not once. The waitress just doesn't charge for it because it comes out of the fountain and costs about a half a cent ! add a quarter slice of lime and it costs 22.5 cents.  So I complained and the waitress turned on the Tude and so she got NO tip and then proceeded to sulk and it was deplorable. Had she not charged me for soda I would have given her approx ten buck tip because the liver and onions was excellent. Now because of her mostly, I'll never set foot in the place again."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is known for one thing: whiskey.  However, i didn't have one when i was there.  I had a Kilkenny and also the traditional British pub fare, bangers and mash.  The food came looking all fancy, which really surprised me.  It tasted ok.  But in my heart i was craving the traditional style bangers and mash.  But food aside, for those into their drinks, there is a large selection on the menu."}
