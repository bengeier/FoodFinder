{"text":"Gross and took forever. I ordered from New Lucky online via Yelp, so at least part of the problem could've been that the ordering app was buggy. But they got our order wrong, it took 55 minutes (!!), and the food fared between average and gross. I got mushu shrimp, which was average - the leftovers have been sitting untouched in our fridge for 2 days if that tells you anything. My husband ordered sesame beef but received general tso's chicken (I think?), which was neon red, way overly sweet, and so thickly breaded that the meat was an afterthought - gross. We also ordered fried shrimp, which, like the chicken, was way over breaded and had very little flavor. Definitely not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly service - pickup or delivery. I can choose to get Chinese food from multiple restaurants in Squirrel Hill, but the food here is tasty and fresh every time.  I normally hate fried rice but theirs is fluffy and not greasy like it is at most take out places. Singapore mei fun is spicy, as it should be. The only thing I didn't love was one of my favorites - hot and sour soup. Not bad, but it tasted beefy which isn't my preference.   Trust me, the place doesn't look amazing, but the food will surprise you."}
{"text":"GROSSS! poor Chinese they must have said fuck it to the real recipe. Cant make a decent shrimp an broccoli?? Poor excuse for a Chinese restaurant ."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 3 times. Took about an hour to arrive but it has been well worth it. Food is fresh and above average for take out."}
