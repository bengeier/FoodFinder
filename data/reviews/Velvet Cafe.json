{"text":"This little cafe is in a strip mall, blink and you could miss it. While the menu isn't exactly large, it has a nice mix of healthy salads and soups, as well as sandwiches, a couple hot options, desserts and coffees. They also have some smaller kid friendly options. 
There are only a few tables in the cafe, but it has a cosy feel. 
Getting to the important part, the food was excellent. 
My bf and I shared a beet & heirloom lettuce salad and had a panini each. 
The salad if not split, would be simple filling meal on it's own. It had a generous amount of beets, sweet peppers, pumpkin seeds as well as another crunchy topping I couldn't place. The dressing was homemade, and went well with the chosen veg in the salad. 
They didn't skimp out on the fillings in the paninis either. The rosemary bread used was fresh and home made as well. I couldn't finish my sandwich. Don't remember the last time that happened, since most places tend to cheap out on what's between your slices of bread. 
Add the two americanos, which come from an organic roaster out west, and the bill came out to $23!!!
It's not often you come across a gem like this. Will be heading back soon."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches and cappuccino.  Service has always been fast and attentive.

I appreciate the local feel of the place and have heard good things about their management.  I don't mind paying a little more for a well-crafted sandwich.  I like the elk sandwich, as well as the pulled turkey.  Their curries are yummy and creamy.  

It can get stuffy with the limited seating and heaters.  Their menu isn't too big but that works well for me because I get easily overwhelmed by choices.  My only critique is that they can recycle more if they haven't looked into it already?"}
{"text":"You have got to experience the delicious food prepared at this little cafe!  All the food is prepared with fresh ingredients from scratch. Adam Cook, owner of The Velvet Cafe, is a personable and talented young chef offers delicious homemade soups, fresh salads, grilled paninis, fresh baking, and daily specials. Best of all, you can take it home...wonderful gourmet to go food!  There are also gluten free dishes. We enjoyed the Coconut Chicken Curry that was the special offered for the day. It was a party in your mouth!  They also have specialty coffee and teas.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and if I could give it more than 5 stars I would! Both their Turkey sandwich and the tuna melt are to die for as are all of their baked goods!
Whenever I am in town this is a must!
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and snacks. My fav coffee shop in Calgary! Have been here many times for a London Fog."}
{"text":"Despite having passed this little gem several times, I had never been in to visit. My loss, seriously. Went with a companion who is suuuuuper picky about their coffee, and they were really happy with the coffee they had. I had the BEST americano of my life....and it was decaf. Mind blown! Also, we had samples of their excellent soup and chilli. All of their food is made in house, save the bread. Vegan friendly, celiac friendly, lactose free friendly options. Healthy food made fresh daily. Literally everything looked amazing. Staff was so friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Am I ever happy I walked into this café!
The staff (who I later found out are the owners because they're so friendly and fun to talk to,) are so friendly and fun to talk to, (wouldn't you know it?) they had me at 5-stars before I even sat down. The first thing that crossed my mind was \"Wow! These people are unusually friendly!\" They come across as genuinely passionate about their place and their products without being pushy about them. They seemed honestly pleased that I chose to visit their shop. My second thought: \"Why would that be 'unusual'? I have no idea, but you really did cut through the clutter, Velvet Café!

They have a daily lunch special that changes every day (wouldn't you know it?). If all of them are as good as the one I had today I'll never get bored of eating here.

Today's Special: Spolumbo's sausage on a baguette with sauteéd veggies and some type of fancy aioli whose name escapes me for $7.99. Yum! Along with the sauteéd red and orange peppers this baguette came with a monster helping of sauteéd garlic on a bed of fresh spinach. If you're making this a date or a work lunch, make sure you've got your mints and toothpicks. If you didn't, don't even worry about it. The sandwich is worth sabotaging your love life/job over.
They've also got a whole array of tasty looking salads in the cooler and an assortment of house made sandwiches in the $5 - $6 range. I'm looking forward to checking out the brisket sandwich. I heart Alberta beef.

You're used of seeing a basket of cookies on the counter in a coffee shop. But are you used to seeing CARAME BACON COOKIES?! I thought not.
They serve Salt Spring Coffee, my favourite of the \"Gourmet but still available at Safeway\" coffee varietals and there are plenty of loose leaf tea types for all you tea drinkers out there. 

The place is modern, approachable and acceptable for a really wide range of people. Large windows are everywhere so you can bask in the sunshine, or sit on the patio on the warm days, or cuddle up with your coffee by the fire place on the cold ones. There's even a long couch covered in pillows. I think if I sat down here I would never be able to leave.

I hope my solid across the board experience from today is repeatable for everyone, because I think Mt. Pleasant just might have a new gem!"}
{"text":"I want to give this a great review.  But I cant.  The chicken provolone melt i had tasted very off.  It could have been the provolone but I dont know.  I kept eating it though because i never complain and if you pay for something already its kinda pointless, which is I guess the main reason places make you pay for something before eating.  I asked the owners why it tasted off and they made me feel at ease.

I just feel that if you are going to make a sandwitch that tastes like feet you should warn people 'oh , btw, it tastes like 3 day old feet, and for the next day you are going to be burping an old mans foot'.  I now have little red spots on my tounge, which might blister as I cant handle extreme foods, I have a mild pallette.  I did like the jalepino's, but still the taste of 'BAD FEET' is not going away.  I can eat candied jalepino's and its excellent.  So something was definitly off about the sandwitch.  I think because probobly no one comes in and buys sandwiches.  I duno.  I dont like stinky feet smelling cheese, and i dont like extremely gamey flavour in Lamb or Goat meat.

Maybe they should list their panini's as \"old mans foot chicken panini\" ...

I tried the elk salami and it was pretty good, nothing to complain about.

They seem like a great place and if I didnt have this bad experience, i would probobly come back again.  But All i can say is maybe if you dont like stuff smelling rotten or stinky then ask if it has a pungent odour."}
{"text":"It was mid-afternoon and I NEEDED a double espresso immediately. (My caffeine addiction is my only real vice, and I bow to it always...) 

Imagine my delight when I spotted the Velvet Cafe as I was driving down 4th Street N.W.! A new coffee place to try! 

I was immediately greeted by one of the owners upon entering this delightful cafe and lunch spot. The owner  'took me on a tour' pointing out the baked goods, food items, the loose leaf teas and advising me that he used Salt Spring Island coffee (which I had not tried before). He also gave me a sample of a great chocolate chip cookie since it was near the end of the day. He said they bake all of their baking fresh each day.

I ordered a double espresso and was pleased with the smooth strong taste. I would definitely drink Salt Spring island espresso on a daily basis.

My friend ordered a hot chocolate. Get this, the owners make their own ganache (a thick chocolate mixture, like 2 parts chocolate, 1 part cream) instead of a powdered hot chocolate mix or syrup. The hot chocolate was likely the one of the best hot chocolates I've ever tried! (I stole a sip from my friend and then begged for more!)

(FYI: Another place I love for hot chocolate is Cafe Angeline in Paris, France)"}
{"text":"Noticed Velvet Cafe on skipthedishes and decided to bring in lunch for the office.   I may have broken them as they removed the delivery option following my order so I'm not sure what's up with that.... 

But....   lunch was delicious.  I secretly wish I had just ordered myself several chocolate hazelnut croissants and just eaten those.  But I ate my roasted pepper sandwich first like a good girl and then celebrated veggies with one of those heavenly pastries.  I even allowed other people to eat theirs without stealing any of them at plastic fork point.   It took great willpower... 

I skipped ordering the elk sausage as I wasn't sure how that would go over... but if I'm able to order from them again I'm apparently suppose to buy them some elk sausage sandwiches because those apparently are great.  

I wish the menu was larger. The food was a bit pricey for what I can normally bring into the office at lunch but it was good.  Maybe not the place for the hungry and ravenous.  It looks like there are more tasty things that will have to be explored in store so I guess that's my next step... to go in."}
{"text":"This place is so so so good. They have very good coffee but what does it for me in the breakfast and lunch food. It has to be the best cafe food I have had in North America and I have eaten at a lot of places. Try their veggie sandwich and the tuna melt - so so good. Thier daily specials are great. They have a great chef and friendly servers. You can the food smell on your clothes sometimes but it tells you they are cooking food in real time. Love it."}
{"text":"First time in this place, I woke up with a need for good latte, it's not close to my place but it's worth the drive, the latte taste really good, I've tried the tuna melt sandwich too it's so good, I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"I really like Velvet Cafe, the coffee and nibbles are marvellous BUT I continue to be disappointed by two things: 1) the hours they keep do not really cater to the public. On weekdays they don't open until 8, which is too late for a lot of early morning commuters; and 2) if you go for 8 am, there are no fresh muffins available. Am i wrong to expect a food business opening at 8 to have their pastries ready for morning customers? I actually stopped going there because of this and decided to try them again this morning to see if anything has changed ... it hasn't. They can run their operation any way they like of course, but I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"The Velvet cafe has the best service and THE best food.  The owners are an absolute dream team.  This is my stop every time time I go to Calgary. (I'm from Vancouver).  I always love their Vegan Specials and I'm not even Vegan.  Lol.  A must see next time you're in this part of town.  Oh I forgot, make sure you get the chocolate mocha. They use amazing chocolate and they don't skimp .  Always support local business.  I'm happy they're here in Calgary."}
{"text":"Omg this plaaaaace! And it's right next to my house! I'm in trouble.
If you're going to spend 4-6$ on a delicious hand-crafted espresso drink, PROMISE me you get it from Velvet Cafe???????
After trying to get into John's Bfast and Lunch which had a grand total of like 4 tables, my husband I decided to check out Velvet Cafe and to our surprise, they had hot breakfasts!  The staff, who I think are the owners, are incredible excited and friendly.  Their breakfast special on this particular day was a breakfast wrap with egg and house made sausage. Um yum.  I paired this with a salted caramel latte and just about died and went to heaven.  I literally sent my brother AND another friend to Velvet Cafe the same day. I'm going back, I can't wait to see what else they have baking up this week."}
