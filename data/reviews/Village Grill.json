{"text":"The Village Grill is a small place tucked into the Cannon Village area of Kannapolis.  There are about a half dozen tables inside the grill, with some outdoor tables and umbrellas for when the weather cooperates.  The interior is dedicated to the retro grill look, with oldies playing through the speakers and old advertisements lining the walls.    Their menu is simple, but true to a Southern grill/diner.  I'm a fan of the sandwiches and burgers, but they also have salads and more substantial entrees.  My favorite dish here is the Ranch burger.  Double patty, bacon, grilled onions, Swiss cheese, and ranch dressing.  Wow, my mouth waters just thinking about it.  And it is served with a heaping plate of warm, crispy fries.  It's a delicious lunch, and a great place to socialize during the midday hours.    The staff are friendly and inviting, ready with a smile and a quick refill of your water (or soda).  Stop by and have a great lunch.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have recently been going to this restaurant for breakfast during the week and the weekend and we are extremely satisfied with the food, and the wait staff are just outstanding...they are very friendly always walking around to check on your meal to see if it meets your requirements...we have never been disappointed in the food, the portions or the staff...they make breakfast a great start to our day....we love you guys!"}
{"text":"Ok. It is a bit tiring coming here only to be told, \"Sorry, we are out of a certain thing\". I come here because of the family. I find the food to be the same quality as just about anywhere else in Monroe, average. Yes, the waitresses are rather benign to the customer service idea, but friendly. If you are looking for a the basics, here you are. If you haven't been here, I wouldn't bother. Stay on Hwy 74."}
{"text":"Came here twice.  Atmosphere was friendly.  You're required to walk in and make an order, pay then sit.  Didn't realize that was how they did it at first since I didn't see any signs.  It felt awkward standing there while trying to decide.  Food was okay, mediocre and typical food.  Not a bad place to eat but nothing special either."}
{"text":"The window display was enough to turn me away.   Would never give this place my business."}
{"text":"Very slow service and poorly prepared food.   I got a burger and said no mayo.  It arrived covered in mayo and when they corrected the order after a significant wait the bun was soggy from the wet limp piece of lettuce they put on it.   The fries were cold and mushy as well."}
{"text":"Great location but awful service and mediocre food!  From their window display supporting deportation of immigrants (which is terribly rude for a business btw and fyi) to the lack of seasoning I will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"This is a classic, old-time sandwich grill. Situated in the formerly-robust mill district of Kannapolis, the Grill has survived and is benefiting from the new Research Campus.   A wide variety of sandwiches and entrees are available- think of what you'd expect from a 70s lunch counter. I like to go off menu and get a grilled ham and cheese on rye. Some homemade oatmeal pies and a variety of cake slices are available too.  Not a place to go out of your way to find, but good food at a fair price if you are in this area of Kannapolis"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice casual restaurant we happened upon the Village Grill.  You order at the counter and food is delivered to your table.  We had a Greek Salad and chili.  The chili was tasty, with a slight burn that made it pleasant.  It was ground beef with beans and thick.  It is served with crackers.  The Greek Salad is enough to share with another and is served with warmed pita bread.  All in all a nice meal for a very reasonable cost.  The facility is clean, the windows sparkle.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My second visit here, previously breakfast, this time lunch.  I am officially a fan.  Today I had the rueben sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries.  So darn good!  And plenty as to not keep you wanting more.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted and the fries were sprinkled in brown sugar with a side of honey mustard in lieu of ketchup.  Since this place is in a small town (relatively) the service is what I like to call home grown.  Real polite and genuine.  They make you feel at home.  Decor isn't anything to really write home about and the only thing that is a turn off for me personally is the way you have to order and then find your seat.  Silly, but I just prefer to have a full waitstaff experience when I go out and spend money on a meal.  Either way that's not enough to keep me from coming back!"}
{"text":"If your hours say you are open until 2:30, you should keep the restaurant unlocked until that time. My husband has been in the restaurant business for over 20 yrs and would never allow his staff to lock up before closing!!"}
{"text":"The location is nice. The staff are all friendly and making sure you have everything. I orders the French flash which were really good. If you order eggs make sure you let them know how cooked you want them. We asked for sunny side up and they were a little raw. But other than that, overall it was very good. Would definitely come back. It was also inexpensive. Great atmosphere. Really good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Your mom-and-pop type place. They have some very loyal regulars here. They have a pretty extensive menu for small shop and there is plenty of parking. This spot is pretty much down the street from the Monroe mall. As soon as you enter you are greeted and should probably have your order ready if you get in line. They move quick here. On the wall you will find several schools represented so if you don't see yours they will welcome your school with open arms as long as you bring in the banner yourself. I had chicken wrap with the fries I like the wrap, but the fries were a bit soggier than I like. This is definitely a place to come to for a burger or fried shrimp. They have indoor and outdoor seating.  I wonder if they give a discount to first responders because that's all I saw here- lol. I only came during lunch so I am not sure what dinner and breakfast are like but willing to give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is good in this tiny little place. It tends to be busy so you can expect to either wait for a table Or eat outside. Everyone was very friendly. Like that there are some vegetable options to go with your sandwich rather than just fries. The issue i have with this place is they have a political sign in their front window. Whether you agree or disagree with what it says, i just don't feel it is appropriate to put in the window of a restaurant. When i go out to lunch i want to relax and enjoy my lunch and not think about politics."}
{"text":"Not sure where or what the previous reviewers were commenting on, we decided to give this place a try..... I would never go back. Sorry! although the sevice was pleasant the food was not. The Ham was so salty and reheated that was hard to chew as thin as paper, the breakfast potatoes iiack! were old, and had a taste of going bad and the biscuit was from last month.  I understand there aren't many places to go to in this small town, but old food is just not excusable."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and it was nice to find a small place away from the craziness in the land of traffic, fast food, and lights."}
{"text":"Been there a couple times. Both times I went they were missing key ingredients for some of their meals. I had to suffice with something I didn't want and it still wasn't tasty."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a bite if you're in the Monroe area. I've been here numerous times. Kinda of a \"down home country cookin\" place. You walk in, place your order at the counter, pay, then find your seat. They give you a number and deliver the goodies. You can get everything from meat loaf, mashed potatoes & green beans to fried fish to a cheesy western omelet w/ grits & hash browns. Oh yes, they serve breakfast all day long. I haven't written too many reviews but you'll notice I do dig breakfast for dinner:) Stopped by today w/ the wife for a quick late lunch. We both had the cheese burger. It was surprisingly good. She got hers w/ bacon and lots of it! Ordered the side of sweet potato fries. The dipping sauce that came with it was out of this world good!! It was my first time trying the sweet potato fries here. I'll order those again for sure. One draw back is they don't stay open late. I think they close by 8pm during the week."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my niece and her boyfriend on a Friday afternoon.  You go up to the counter and pay first then they deliver the food to your table. The service was OK. She didn't really keep our cups full or check on us like I think she should have but she was nice when she dropped off our food. This is a cool little breakfast spot. I would go back again in the future,"}
{"text":"Food is great! Very friendly staff, always helpful. Prices are very reasonable. Very clean restrooms! Extremely large variety ! We eat here at least two/three times a week. I really like the fact that the staff does not change daily, they have been there for quite a while Which makes for better service. Love it!"}
