{"text":"I actually love the food here. The meat has tons of flavour and is juicy. The dressing and chutneys are very tasty and the food is very fresh. My complaint is this. Be careful while ordering out. Nine out of ten times I've ordered out they have gotten the order wrong.  Review your order with the server at least ten times!!! Today I ordered 3 chicken dinners and 3 barg kebab dinners. Easy right? I quadruple checked with the server if she understood. Go to pick up my order and she had 3 chicken dinners and 1 barg kebab ready for me. There is always a miscommunication with the server on the phone. She has trouble understanding English. Other than that, Atmosphere is great and lots of room. Service in person is great. Food amazing. Barg kebab is very tender. Please put someone on the phone that can speak English please!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for Afghan food.  They serve traditional afghan cuisine.  Service is good, when very busy, does take longer to order and get the good.  But when the food arrives, its awesome.  The flavours are not overpowering, food is piping hot, and nans are fresh. I would highly recommend to get their homemade hot sauce.  Their bolani (crispy dough stuffed with potatoes) and their eggplant dish, appetizer, is awesome. They are way ahead in taste to other afghani restaurants like bamiyan ..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, authentic and comes with excellent service.  Prices are more than fair.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and attentive service!  This was our first time eating Afghani food - so delicious.  We had the family platter, at the suggestion of staff.  We had a salad, a wonderful array of appetizers, delicious main with fragrant rice and chicken, and a custard dessert.  Very good, and we will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Although their food may be medicore, which it was, nothing special. The service was beyond terrible, our waitress asked for our orders like she was doing US a favour. When my friend asked for some yogurt, because CLEARLY, their Aush could use more yogurt, she rolled her eyes at us and was so hesitent like it was going to make or break their resturants profit (mind you, our many orders of food could feed a village, so lady, IM SURE IT WASNT GOING KILL YOUR BUSINESS IF U GAVE US SOME YOGURT, even if u wanted to charge us money for that). We then asked for starws which she said yes, and never gave. P.S. Please drop by a pakistani resturant to know how REAL BIRYANI tastes like before you go offering such bland tasteless rice on the menu and calling it \"Biryani\". Perhaps it was just our bad luck with the AUNTY WAITRESS we got, who could seriously GROW UP, with her childish attitude. Lady please, if you dont want to serve food, go home and knit or sew, but dont be in a customer service business, its bad for business. Your serving customers, and for god sakes, dont start speaking Persian with anyone that walks through the resturant because suprise suprise, Canada is comprised of many other races than persian speaking individuals. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, I hav to give ONE STAR, but i wouldnt even give them that ONE STAR. Be knowledgable about your menu, dont be rude, and treat others how you want to be treated, with respect. First, and definately LAST TIME HERE."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food. I've never had afghani food before but this did not disappoint. Meats were really well seasoned and it was exciting to try new things. Similar flavours to indian food"}
{"text":"One of the best Afghani restaurants in the GTA. It has great flavourful meats and wonderfully seasoned rice. I love their dough, yogurt drink, simply delicious! The service was prompt and very professional.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is authentic with nice cultural dresses hung up on the walls. Gives the place a really nice vibe. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I went there during Ramadan where they had an open buffet for 16  dollars per person  Food was hot and very tasty would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Amazing! We catered food for our wedding and the service and food was excellent! Everyone was raving about the delicious food. Thank you Sulaiha & team for making our wedding that much better! Authentic Afghan food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant three times now and you may be wondering why we keep returning if I'm only giving it 2 stars... I really wanted to like this place because it is very difficult to find good Afghan cuisine (their only redeeming quality is the food and that is ONLY if they serve it to you correctly), but the dining experience and service is so horrendous that it deters me from wanting to visit again.  The tone of our meal was set from the moment our server first took our order. When she took our drink orders, we had asked for sprite, but received ginger ale instead. When we informed her of this, she said they didn't have sprite and ginger ale was the same thing. It isn't. Then, we inquired about the dal makhani and she told us it was the same as butter chicken - which I thought was questionable considering the item has daal in the name.   Finally we settled on ordering the \"Party for 6\" platter, which includes two chicken tikka skewers and two chicken breast skewers, among other items. When the platter came, I noticed that the chicken tikka skewers were missing so I tried to get a copy of the menu to confirm, but was ignored by our server.   Throughout our meal, our server continued to ignore us and never refilled the water even after we had politely requested. After 15 minutes, I had to get up from the table, seek her out and remind her to bring the water. At this point, I asked for a copy of the menu again.  When she came back, I asked her about the missing chicken tikka skewers. She pointed to the one of the chicken breast skewers and said told us that was the chicken tikka. We said that those are the chicken breast skewers, not chicken tikka. She points to ANOTHER chicken breast skewer and said that's the chicken breast skewer. When we told her this can't possibly be true because both the \"tikka\" and chicken breast skewers looks and tastes the exact same, she told us chicken tikka and chicken breast are the same because \"chicken is chicken.\" Uh what??  My family didn't want to make a scene so we carried on with our meal (with no chicken tikka) and when we were finished and tried to get the bill, she continued to ignore us so we had to get another server to bring boxes and the bill.  Oh and did I mention, on the way out, I saw another table had chicken tikka skewers? Let me tell you, it did not look like the \"chicken tikka\" we had on our table."}
{"text":"Friendly but slow service even though restaurant was not full.  Food was delicious but the potions could be bigger (platter meant for 8, but enough for 6).  Nan (bread) was delicious!!  Extra points for having halal meat, alcohol-free environment and a prayer place for those who need it.  Will definitely come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant warranted my first review because I enjoyed it that much! It was my first Ahfgan cuisine experience and I will definitely be going back.  I had their combo #2 which includes a salad,  brown rice, lamb tikka, chicken breast and beef kafta. All were seasoned perfectly.  Along with great food, the service was on point. If you're in the Mississauga area, you should definitely make an effort to check this place out."}
{"text":"Loved sitting on the floor to eat here! We had a huge family platter and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for some good kebab, Chopan Grill is my favourite place to go. When I'm with a group or family, we order the \"Party of Four\" family pack with the chicken and beef kofta kabobs. The rice is lightly flavoured and very yummy, the chicken is seasoned perfectly. My SO is a big fan of the beef kofta. The chicken curry \"Qorma-e-Morgh\" is also delicious.  The decor isn't the best, neither is the layout however the space is VERY big (Rainbow Buffet was in this space prior to Chopan's opening). The servers are always very polite but often very quiet. The atmosphere is kind of dreary which is why I have only given it 4 stars.  The food is what you're there for! I love it."}
{"text":"~3.5 stars~  I was amazed to find this location... the restaurant was huge and had a perfect authentic cultural vibe. There was even a section with lower tables to be seated on the floor.  I took my family there so we got to try multiple things. We started with French fries and hummus with naan, the hummus had the right amount of bitterness so they didn't over do on tahini.  For the main course we order their party of eight platter. The platter included two skewers Chicken Breasts, four skewers Beef Kofta Kabobs, four skewers Chicken Kofta Kabobs, two Chapli Kabobs with comes with Rice and Salad. You can also upgrade the rice to kabili rice. All kababs were very well marinated and cooked. The portions were huge, so we had to pack some food to go. The naans don't come with the platter and you will have to order them separately.  The service was good and the food came in a decent time frame.  For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve halal food at this location"}
{"text":"Amazing food in this place, so tasty and fresh. Service is also very good, since it was my 1st time in there I asked for recommendations and the dishes were just delicious. I ordered the mantooo and the chicken tikka kabob, both were very good. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Good food. I particularly liked the rice - it was well cooked and softer than other rice that I've eaten.   I ordered the lamb kebab and Kofta and found the mean pretty good. Nothing too crazy but still good food. I also ordered a shish kebab to go but was a little disappointed with the amount of meat given.   Overall, the atmosphere was good and I would recommend this place to someone who wants to try an Afghan restaurant."}
{"text":"The portions here are massive. One of the combination meals will feed 2 people. The kofta plate which comes with chicken and beef is my fav. The rice looks plain but it is so flavourful. And I love the onions they place on top. The salad is also tasty. Add a side order of spinach!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for more than a year now. And every single time the food is excellent, the quality and flavour is a constant and I haven't found a dish in the menu that is not outstanding.  I've tried all the kabobs, chicken, beef and lamb and all of them are just fantastic.  The soups are also very good and portions are well served.  Did I mentioned the quality of the rice? Mmmm just wonderful!  The service is very good and fast, the restaurant is very big, so there is a sensation of emptiness, but that should not discouraged to try it.  Best afghani food in Mississauga with no doubt!"}
{"text":"Decided to do an impromptu business lunch based on reviews. I would rate it as average. My Doug was a little too watery and the addition of ice cubes did not help. Too much rice with the entrees. Kababs were good but lacked that extra spiciness that keeps you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I passed by this place many times but never stopped by until recently.  I wish I had earlier. This place is a hidden gem, as the food is very good, plentiful and service is top notch, as if you are eating in more expensive place.  The restaurant is located in very poorly visited little neighborhood shopping corner, so this restaurant does not receive the customer traffic that it deserves.  I ordered some dumplings and kabobs and they were both excellent.  The service I received at Chopan was stellar and could not ask for more.  The restaurant is plenty spacious and looks like a place I can take my family or friends without worrying about bumping elbows.  I think this restaurant deserves more patronage than it has now, being poorly located.  Only advice I can give to the owner of this place is to use more and better social media and internet marketing.   This restaurant is a hidden gem that deserves to be found by more customers and stay in business.  BB"}
{"text":"What a brilliant restaurant. The food is not only incredibly fresh but it's made all in house. Including the noodles. The dinner special for 4 was $79.99 and it came with a drink, starter, main course, and dessert. Everything was beautifully plated and each dish was so different from the next. The whole experience was exquisite. We didn't stop talking about the food for days. Well worth the visit. And tell your friends and family. Cause I want to tell the world."}
{"text":"So tasty. The most dominant flavor here is yogurt. Yogurt with mint. Yogurt with sumac. Yogurt with pumpkin. Yogurt with lemon... ahh, so good!  Totally delicious and if you like anything that's Indian flavored or Mediterranean, this is your spot. The food is different. I don't eat Afghan food on the regular. This -- gonna be my regular. Totally delicious and beautiful restaurant inside."}
{"text":"Had a party of 25 here for a wedding event.  Chose this place because of their consistently amazing food and good customer service.  I had some of the most delicious mantoo I've ever had (steamed dumplings filled with ground meat and topped with a ground meat tomato sauce, yogurt and beans). Great, affordable restaurant with quality food!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! Best afghani food in Mississauga. I ordered borani badimjan and lentil soup & combo #4 (lamb chop, chicken, lamb tika). I enjoyed it soo much!!  Yummyyyyyy"}
{"text":"Good clean restaurant and friendly staff but the beef kebob kind of smelled a bit and the chicken tikka kebob was loaded with masala. Its Afghan food but taste more like Pakistani food. I hope the owner reads this and uses this review to review his/her menu. They really need to try Bamiyan. (Even Nader's has better Afghani food and its owned by a Turkish). Buy very nice staff. All that best."}
{"text":"My family and I have come here many times from across the border.  Finding a great Afghan place is hard.  But this place is so consistent and their food always full of flavor.  One of our favorites.  We always order extra food to take home."}
{"text":"This place opened a few years ago but never came to try it until today ! So what are my thoughts ?  Well ....service was a little slow , however the waiter was helpful with the menu and to explain things . The prices were alright . The food was decent but came with a lot of rice ! Not much meat and I got the lamb shank !  If I were to give it a ranking it be as follows  Service --5 out of 10 Food.   -- 7 out of 10 Quality -- 7 out of 10 Atmosphere -- 7 out of 10  All in all the food was decent  They are good for groups !"}
{"text":"A pretty good Afghani-Indian place in the area!  The commercial-office unit that the restaurant is located in is in a really weird area.  Although it's facing Erin Mills Parkway, right across from Sheridan Mall (dead), it's not easy to access the parking lot.  There's only 1 entrance/exit on the north side, so this may have something to do with the less than bustling atmosphere.  The menu is quite similar to other Afghani places with an added dimension of Indian food as well.  Service was friendly, although English wasn't 100% proficient.  Communication was still ok.  I ordered fries, but my dinner came with rice, and they just brought a side of fries IN ADDITION to the rice.  Portion EASILY is 2-3 portions where the rice is considered!  The portion of protein was sufficient for at least 1 meal+.  *If* I was in the area and felt like Afghani food, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant may have been excellent a few years back. But what I experienced as a take-out customer was dismal. I cannot comment on their service, but from where I stood the place looked clean yet empty. I ordered Beef Kabobs/Chicken Breast Kabob and Tandoori Chicken Kabobs to go with Rice. I took the food home and found my order was correct but I think the food shrunk. Their Beef Kabob's are the size of a small Chocolate Bar and their Chicken Kabob's are bite size. What a dissapointment, I would'nt recommend anyone this restaurant even if it was the last Afgan grill in mississauga. In my humble opinion, for a restaurant to be great success the food must always outshine the decor or even customer service. I request readers to try other Afgani restaurants. Watan Kabob for sure or Naan & Kabob or Bamiyan Kabob are just a few excellent restaurants in Mississauga."}
