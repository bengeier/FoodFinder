{"text":"The restaurant is located inside Caesars Palace all the way in the back near Mesa Grill.  We ordered the following: -Lt. Dan; an alcoholic ice tea lemonade perfect for those who like strong herbal tea flavors.  -Snake in the grass;  a classic mojito with lots of mint.  -Pan Seared Scallops with Couscous and Citrus Sauce;  three jumbo size scallops cooked to tender perfection on a bed of couscous with pesto and citrus sauce. The  couscous was delicious and blends very well with the thick pesto sauce; however, there was that additional sweet and sour like sauce  that the boyfriend and I weren't fond of because it didn't add to anything.     -The Porkbutt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion was the most popular and recommended dish, but had mixed reactions from us. I'll admit the pork was so tender, so moist,  and practically melted in our mouths, but I found the porkbutt and bacon emulsion too salty and overwhelming. If you love salty foods like the boyfriend, then this is a must try dish.  I do love the whiskey apples which added a crunchy texture and pickled flavor to combat the salty and fatty porkbutt.   Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back to try the duck next time."}
{"text":"Having heard such praise about this place from a friend, we opted to take a few out-of-town friends here as their first Phoenix area dining experience. We were not disappointed! Recently opened, Searsucker is sure to become an even more popular restaurant.  *The lounge-like atmosphere gives you a choice of seating in a community table, bar, couch area or regular dining setting. This venue would work well in Manhattan. On busy nights (we went on Saturday), be weary of reservations in the couch area--you can reserve anywhere!   *We were told of a reservation there in advance and instead of rushing, we chose to sit at the community table (just to the right of the DJ), which was at that point empty (@730 pm). The upbeat music complemented the good service and great ambience . By the time we were leaving at 10 pm, the lounge area was so packed that we had to weave our way out.   *As a group of 5, we ate mostly Bites, Ands, Greens and Smalls...you cannot go wrong with the fried brussels(~$6), mushroom and burrata(~$13) and squid(~$8), and of course, nothing gets the evening started like the cheddar puffers. Of course, that is about as much as I remember before Peter Rabbit(~$12) coyly took over. They do valet but I was not driving.  *Peter Rabbit: If you are not sure about what drink you are feeling, then search no further, this must be your choice--Pimm's #1 (based on gin), bruised basil, pressed lemon, and pickled carrot=a delectable mixture of yummy.   Prices seemed fairly standard for Scottsdale restaurants in terms of entrees (aka Ocean, Ranch and Farm)--$15-33, appetizers (Ands, Greens and Smalls)--$6-15, and drinks (specialty cocktails, infusions, wine and beer)--$7-12...but I am oh so curious about the ribeye \"tomahawk\" with cognac + horseradish=$75....maybe next time, because I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is insanely good. Great food, great bar and awesome atmosphere.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our evening at Searsucker. The decor and service were excellent. Food choices were limited and not for every taste. Both small plates we ordered were very good. I had Ono and did not care for the fish, it was dry and chewy. The topping on fish was very tasty. We were a party of four. Two of us said we would return."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS CLOSED.  I made reservations at the beginning of the month through Open Table and had been looking forward to going all week as a date night with the hubs. We received a confirmation email yesterday for our reservations last night, but when we arrived there was a sign on the door saying that Searsucker was closed. I thought it a bit rude that they didn't even call us to let us know. When I looked it up on-line today, I found out that it is closed permanently (and seemingly suddenly). I hope that all of the workers can find new positions; otherwise, what a crappy way to start the new year.  (http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/dining/articles/20140108searsucker-scottsdale-closes-closed.html)"}
{"text":"The staff was very accomodating. Food was excellent. We had the mussels small plate, Mahi and Scallops entree. They were all great! Great restaurant and great food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their brussel sprouts with walnuts. I would go back and just order that as a meal. As my entree, I ordered the flank steak. It was good, but I would probably order and try something else. It was nothing special. They said the pork butt was a popular dish.  5 stars for customer service. Our waiter was amazingly awesome.   I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Our server was quite attentive until we only ordered 3 appetizers, a soda and a beer (for 2). Then he seemed annoyed and virtually disappeared.  The food was great and our \"small bites\" meal was still $60."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas this year so I blindly started to find my way around this 24 hour city.. it being the Mecca of gourmet restaurants, I've been excited to explore the culinary side of the strip. I play poker at various casinos but Caesars has been my recurring spot lately. I found Searsucker a few weeks ago and being new to yelp, I realized I could express my experience publicly as the appreciation is properly due. This causal fine dining restaurant falls nothing short to to expectation. They combine a sports like atmosphere with the TV's at the bar and an almost California rustic lay out. The pretty blonde bartender was the most funny, entertaining person. I made a few friends at the bar because she interacted with all of us together, it's actually a pretty amazing talent to give multiple people so much comfortability and attention that it breaks down that awkward barrier everyone has these days, especially with technology in the way. Bars are meant for that. To pull someone away from their phone and space bubble is hard to do. She honestly illuminates that bar with her personality and it shows. All the bartenders helped guide me through the menu and I ended up devouring the recommendations. I like the simple fact that their menu has causal bar food as well as upscale selections with a twist. The frenched lollipop wings, bone marrow and brussels sprouts were outstanding. I wish I could have ordered the calamari and shishito peppers but I will have to wait until next time. Overall the dishes and service were memorable. The way Vegas should be."}
{"text":"Place is not worth the price. Way over priced food and drinks. Place has a strange atmosphere and customer service was truly lacking. It takes you forever to get your order in and to get anyones attention. Their menu is difficult to understand and servers are wasting time explaining everything to customers. High end restaurant pricing with casual environment. Save your money and go elsewhere for the money you will drop here.  Very disappointed for the owner to be a winner of Top Chef.  What a let down.  Walk around the corner from this place in the Casino to Bobby Flay's, you will be 100X better off for the same price if not lower."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Excellent service. Excellent food.  Servers really know the menu. Go for the drinks or the food, or (I recommend) both.  Signature drinks are worth your while and then some...but the food...oh my. So good!  The beet salad says it all:  simple, yet fantastic. The goat cheese balls make even the non-salad fan happy.  I have no favorites, it was allllll good.  We had an assortment of \"smalls\" (appetizers) and entrees and even dessert...each one was superb.  I'm especially a fan of the Squid \"Sweet Heat\".  Visually intriguing and the taste was appealing!  The bavette \"flank\" was perfection."}
{"text":"This is one outstanding restaurant!!! Shouldn't be missed by anyone loving interesting and different food. We had a fantastic time with the whole dining experience. Great service from the moment the bar manager saw our drink order and rushed over with enthusiasm to discuss the  possibilities, to dessert. We didn't get beyond the small plates. Between the four of us we ordered 9 different small plates and loved them all, interesting flavor combinations."}
{"text":"The space is very cool, the music way too loud and it is really hard to hear in this restaurant.  I've been to 2 business lunches and one group function and it was the same on all three occasions.  They also have mismatched chairs (on purpose) but some of them are downright uncomfortable.  The 3 salads I had were all pretty bad.  First was a Caesar with grilled shrimp.  The shrimp is all that was worth eating and it was \"ok\", nothing special.  The lettuce is drenched in \"caesar\" which is really just a white, flavorless sauce.  There is absolutely NO flavor to this dressing. Bland.  On the next visit I ordered the Cobb Salad.  The menu is very misleading on this one - there is nothing remotely resembling a Cobb salad.  Nothing chopped on it...it comes with exactly one half of a hard boiled egg, a little mediocre bacon and maybe tomatoes if I remember correctly.  I ordered chicken to be added to it.  It comes out as a breast served in large slices (again not chopped/diced).  The worst part is again the dressing.  You've been warned - this is not a Cobb salad.  My dining mate on this occasion asked for a roll to go with his Cobb salad when he saw how small/unappetizing it looked and they brought him a slice of wheat bread (like toast).  Just plain weird.  On the last occasion I was at a group function and we were served the caesar with chicken.  I already knew I hated the dressing and I don't care for their chicken - it is sort of on the \"wet\" side and it has no flavor either.  And the chef must really not want to chop anymore than he has to...I hate big huge pieces of chicken that I have to cut over the lettuce.  Someone told me that salads are not their thing (the menu would leave you to think otherwise) and to order meatier things there.  Honestly, none of the sandwiches that went by me looked good and I doubt I'll give it a 4th try just for a sandwich.    I'll stick to LGO, Chelsea's, Fox restaurants and a whole lot of other places that serve great lunches!"}
{"text":"I brought a group of 37 clients/colleagues to Searsucker on 10/22/13.  Thanks to Kelley, Zack, and their staff, we had a great time!  The space was perfect for our group and both the service and the food were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with some friends. We tried a bunch of the happy hour appetizers. The spicy shrimp and grits and the mussels with chorizo were my favorites.  The service was great and ambiance is super cute, just the location is very poor.  I would not have found it if I hadn't looked it up. I had the Peter Rabbit and a jalapeño margarita. Both were really good, but I would have liked the margarita spicier. I will for sure be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, kind of like a high end dive bar. Food was invigorating, lots of flavor with ever bite. Fish tacos were great and so was the iced tea lemonade cocktail. The Chef was going around greeting everyone and chatting at tables for all those top chef fans out there."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best experiences I've ever had from a culinary perspective.  The Service staff was exceptional.  It seemed like every time I was finished with a drink or plate it was immediately picked up and the table was reset.  Server was extremely versed in his craft and made the experience very fun.  He suggested that we just let him lead the way and he essentlally just paired multiple appetizers and two entrees for a table of 4.  Before I go on about the food I must also say I had some of the most unique cocktails I've ever had.  Done very simply but genius at the same time.  Our server once again asked if he could just order for us and we definitely weren't disappointed.  Peter Rabbit was spectacular and he suggest we have the Coyote chase the Rabbit after.  The Coyote was a take on a Bourbon Mule and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.  I was told it was in house infused Cinnamon Whiskey, Fresh Lime Juice, Gossling Ginger Beer and soda.  Topped with beautiful Cinnamon Stick and Lime.  Oh my God so good.. Ok back to the food.  The appetizers were absolutely spectacular especially the Bacon N' Eggs and Shrimp N' Grits.  Each don't sound great but both we're some of the finest displays of pairing very basic food but taking it to another level you've never tasted.  Brilliant!!  I'm going to end this saga with the best cut of meat I've ever had in my life.  This isn't a B.S. statement.  I will put it up against any Steakhouse in Scottsdale.  I won't name names but I was across the street the week before for steak and this blew it away.  It's called the Tomohawk.  It's a 28oz bone in Ribeye with a Horseradish/Cognac Demi glaze.  This steak was cooked to perfection and had the best flavor I've ever had in a steak.  Over the top good.    I could go on and on about this place.  The vibe, the bar, DJ, ect.. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"While the decor is unique & fun, and the names of the dishes are playful & young, overall it wasn't someplace where I left saying \"wow, I want to go back again!!\""}
{"text":"Searsucker is good and I'm confident will get better. We went there one week after opening in Scottsdale. It took a server way too long to actually greet us and take our order. However, they were very friendly and accomodating. The menu is so large is why I'm guessing all the food wasn't great.The shrimp appetizer was just ok but the calimari was exceptional. For dinner we had the swordfish which was very good. I look forward to trying this place again and I'm sure it will be improved."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was awful....server kept leaving the restaurant probably for some extra curricular activities.  We had to flag down the manager to get our check. Save your time and a lot of money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our server was so exceptional. Dez, my wife was not feeling well when we arrived and by the time we left Dez had cheered her up and pampered her so much she was in much better spirits. We will defiantly be back, the food was great as well."}
{"text":"Frustrating with the manager as they told us that this place is full but wasn't even full and force us pay 60 per person   Poor management and will not return.  Brought over 18 customers.  Thanks for providing horrible experience at the end."}
{"text":"I had peter rabbit, tried it cause of the name, was not impressed. Ordered sangaria, waited for more than 30 min, after asked waitress about my drink several time, my friend finally went and got it for me. The meat ball was not impressive, but the presentation was nice. The \"Shrimp with Bacon Grit\" was a turn off.  I don't mind going there with friends for an outting in the future, but I doubt I will suggest going there to friends."}
{"text":"We recently had dinner at Searsucker at Caesar's Palace. Never having visited any of their locations, I was a little nervous about their over-emphasis on \"social dining\" -  sorry, I'm not interested in making new friends during dinner - but, honestly, I didn't notice this in action at the restaurant; we had a four-top for the 4 of us and from what I could see, each group dining had their own space. So that was a relief.  I had no expectations going in and was really very, very pleased with everything we order, from the cocktails to the apps and entrees. We eat a lot in Vegas, like most people, and have eaten both at medium and high end restaurants in that city. For us, particular standouts were the eggs + bacon \"pork belly\", with pork that I swear melted in your mouth, it was so tender, and my loin \"filet\" (not sure why they love to put words in quotes so much...), with lobster butter + mushroom demi glace.    Even though this is a positive review, I do need to add one negative note. Here's what drove me crazy about Searsucker: They have a bathroom attendant in both the men and women's bathroom. In this modern day and age, there is absolutely no f*&#ing reason to have an individual in a bathroom whose sole purpose is to hand you a paper towel, and to be tipped for doing so. But what makes it worse here is that, at least the men's bathroom, is TINY- there is only ONE vanity sink, hemmed in a very small area and this tuxedo-clad attendant (who, upon my entry, startled me by yelling \"Hey, Boss! Welcome to the Men's Room!\") and I had to awkwardly jockey for position in front of it, with him adding value to his service by waving his hand in front of the faucet motion sensor to get my tap started. It's completely ridiculous, awkward and uncomfortable and I know several of us at our table were actually painfully putting off trips to the bathroom just to avoid it. So, if you are reading this Searsucker, ditch the ridiculous bathroom attendants!  But otherwise, we were really very pleased with drinks, food and service. Vegas has too many great places to eat for me to promise to make it back here, but I also wouldn't complain if that ended up happening."}
{"text":"Inside Caesar's Palace. Really nice atmosphere. Great wait staff. A good island of casual calm inside the loud hustle and bustle of the casino. Yummy bites too!!"}
{"text":"Tried Searsucker for a pre-opening dinner with some friends and was quite impressed.  Every dish we tried was quite enjoyable from various appetizers we got to the main courses to the desserts. The service was good given the circumstances of being a pre opening dinner and I'm sure its on point at this time.   I really liked the decor and it seemed a nice step up from a lot of the other spots in town. There was a \"hipness\" to it that I just don't see at a lot of the popular spots in this area that I certainly enjoyed.  The bar is quite good and the crafted cocktails are recommended.   We are definitely interested to try it again when we are down in that part of town."}
{"text":"The crab and avocado spread was delicious; skilled bartenders; I personally didn't enjoy the grass-fed strip steak because it was tough on the outside"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant because of the top chef association, but not good. We arrived early and were greeted nicely and offered drinks. The service issues started when I ordered a sangria and it was really sweet. I went to the bar to get some soda water added and literally sat there for 5 minutes while the bartender chatted with two men at the bar. The bar had 4 people total sitting, so it wasn't busy. Literally, the bartender would not turn around. I went over to the other side of the bar, interupted his conversation, and said the drink was really sweet and he helped me out. He did not offer me another drink, but added the water.   We were seated at a really awkward bar table and we were a party of 15 - very strange when a regular table was available. Maybe they were trying to make the bar look full. The chairs were high, had no backs and everyone was uncomfortable. We received appetizers and they were ok, not great. One pet peeve, they brought appetizers and served bread slices and they only included enough bread for one slice per person, when there was a much larger quantity of the cheese and dip to eat. Then they pulled away the appetizers before people were finished. I was not really impressed with any of the food, the entree was dry and uninspired. The desserts were served family style on a big slab of wood, again awkward. Oh and the strangest thing, the bathroom smelled like a sewer, don't know what's wrong there, but not good at a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and the place was absolutely gangbusters. The bar staff was very helpful and the cocktails were delicious. Unfortunately, that's where the rave review ends.   The three small plates that my girlfriend and I sampled were terrible. The seared scallop came out raw. The crab cake (all meat, no filler- was pretty excited about that) was gross. Maybe the meat wasn't as fresh as it should be? Finally, the mushroom dish was burnt served with \"french toast style\" soggy bread. It just didn't make sense.   After the sampling of terrible food, the bartender closed us out by asking, \"were you ladies abused well enough this evening?\" To that, I should've replied \"Yes. For the price you are charging and the quality of the food- we certainly do feel abused. Thank you for asking.\" Maybe they were just too busy and the kitchen couldn't keep up with the crowd? Or maybe, this place has just been so undeservedly overhyped. Either way, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to the Searsucker in San Diego which is amazing so I had high expectations.  Overall, the Vegas Searsucker was only ok.  I think they are still trying to work out their preparation since it's new.  We started with a Ballerina and the Czar cocktail which was amazing.  We had the farm bird lollipops and they were very flavorful.  The shrimp and bacon grits dish was over sauced and the hot sauce flavor was so strong you couldn't taste the bacon.  The mahi mahi was overcooked and had the consistency of chicken.  The short ribs were excellent as was the strawberry and champagne vinegrette salad.  The warm chocolate chip cookies were absolutely to die for.  They bring a cup of cold milk for dipping."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this location of Seersucker, since the San Diego location is fun!  However, I would have to say my meal was probably in top 5 grossest things I've ever had in a restaurant and I've had Mexican food in London!  If rating on just my main dish, I would have given zero stars, the 2-star rating is because the place itself is nice and our waiter was pleasant.  For the main dish, both my friend and I ordered the quinoa.  I want to say that I love quinoa dishes and order them frequently around town.  I have always loved them which is why I thought the roasted vegetables and quinoa here would be delicious!  IT WAS NOT.  It was gross - basically soggy tasting dirt.  There was a big mound of really wet quinoa, not flavored at all except for the gross dirt taste, a couple sliced sweet potatoes (that were kind-of hard and just tasted plain) and there might have been a couple slivers of kale.  I kept trying to take some more bites, thinking it couldn't be so gross as I thought, but finally I had to give up.  My friend also thought it tasted gross.  I was kind of surprised the waiter didn't say anything when he took our plates, since both were almost completely untouched, he didn't even ask if we liked it.  Not that I expected anything - I obviously made a bad choice, but thought it was weird all the same.  I will not be coming back here.  I think they should be embarrassed to serve such a bad dish.  For the money we spent I really expected something great or at least edible, not soggy dirt.  Gross!"}
{"text":"We ate at Searsucker for the first time last weekend and will definitely be back! Our server Tim was very attentive and offered up great suggestions on the menu. The chicken lollipops are very yummy- think chicken wing meets a sausage meatball. Three of us all tried a different seafood plate (scallops, swordfish and mahi) all were great, matched with excellent sauces. And last but not least the dessert was something i would definitely order again- red velvet cake- some of the best. If you are looking to try a great new restaurant in Scottsdale this is a must- its a little hidden in its location but plenty of parking options."}
{"text":"Visited on Jan 3, 2014, I oredered dinner at the bar, great food. There were 2 bartenders The bar as vary slow. The worst service ever, had to flag them down for drininksmand water. Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries were okay. The pork butt was very good. My husband steak and the Mac and cheese were over salted. Waiter was decent but pushing the up sell on everything."}
{"text":"Expected everything in Vegas to be overpriced... but undersized portions with terrible service? Only at this location. We have these back home in San Diego and they're always great. Our server treated us like crap because we were savvy to their happy hour menu. We still ordered off the regular and he treated us with such hostility. We ended up paying another $100 at a different restaurant to get what we wanted"}
{"text":"The menu is fun, unique and really intriguing!  It was great to just order a bunch of items with our group to pass and share.  Some thing I was hesitant to order were very good.  Service was good, a little on the slow side, but not annoyingly slow.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance! Took them a minute to find our reservation and get the table ready, but not a big deal. Our group of 5 shared several small plates.  Our group's favorite: Bussel sprouts Short rib Squid Mushroom burrata french toast Shrimp ceviche (so good and very different!) Duck fat fries  Skip: Mussels  Dessert: Ermagahd is delicious Smores is ok  Great waiter and very very attentive service. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife out for a Vegas vacation.  We don't gamble so food is an important part of this vacation.  Searsucker exceeded my expectations as a foodie!  We were here to see Absinthe and didn't want a huge meal so we went with the small plates.  We did the Tuna Poke, Duck Fat Fries, Scallop special, and S'mores desert.  Each dish was excellent and easily filled us up.  We will come back once more before we leave"}
{"text":"Hello delicious :). Searsucker is a unique dining experience, and it's one that I've really enjoyed. The way that the menu is set up is different in that you will see many of the ingredients in a dish listed, but not necessarily how it is prepared. Some people will probably be irked by this, but I enjoyed it for the places it lets my mind wander. Also, the restaurant itself spouts a \"social dining environment\" as in they'd rather you speak with your guests or staff, than be on your phone. Or watching TV, which there is none of in the restaurant. So, if you have a question about how the dish is prepared, don't be afraid to ask and become engaged by it! 2 of my favorites are the artichoke appetizer and a fancy cocktail called \"the bootknocker\". You'll need to ask for Roberto for that one. Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will definitely be back.   Everyone was friendly and engaging. Marcos, our server, was attentive, charming, informative and helpful...without being intrusive.   The food was outstanding. The menu is eclectic...and fantastic!  I have never enjoyed Brussels sprouts...and tonight I had seconds.   The scallops were excellent. Others had the filet and the salmon...and everyone rave about it.   Not cheap. Very much worth it."}
{"text":"A new place at Caesars palace right beside the new nightclub Omnia. Its a casual but above average restaurant, with both tables and bar seatings available. If you are by the bar, you can watch sports and ppl passing through the casino for fun.  Quality is also above average and affects pricing which will leave you around $30 for a main. Service is quick and in line with the concept overall, and handles your requests with a smile.  The decor inside gives a cool atmosphere and the open kitchen sets the right ambience for the room. Even though it can be a sports bar, you may not wanna go here if you want to combine a quick bite(read cheap bite) with sports.   I would instead consider this as a new fresh restaurant, where even though you agreed having dinner out, can get away with sneaking in some sports and still leave the place with a ring on your finger."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, the wait staff terrific, and they pour a good glass of wine.  But the food is disappointing.  I was very hungry for lunch, but couldn't get through my utterly tasteless (though highly recommended) chicken sandwich.  My friend sent back the crab and corn soup (described as a chowder, but more like a bisque), and didn't finish her salad.   Guess I won't try dinner...."}
{"text":"Worst experience yet... For a highly acclaimed and talked about restaurant, the place was revolting and an utter disappointment. Now to be fair...the ambiance and atmosphere was very hip, but the hostess and waitstaff were rude and unprofessional. Even simple things like requesting a refill of a glass of water fell on deaf ears. Our particular waiter was a complete moron who could not even remember his own name let alone an order. And the food was over priced and under flavored. In summary, there are far better ways to burn your money..."}
{"text":"Started the meal with the calamari, which was one of the best I've ever had. Had the short rib as my main and it was melt in your mouth, cut with a spoon tender, and packed full of flavor. Our waitress was very attentive and gave us excellent service. The cocktails and atmosphere were a bit lacking."}
{"text":"We went to Searsucker for a bachelorette party last night.  We were seated at the comfy couches that I had reserved. Amy, our wonderful server, came and greeted us and began popping open champagne that one of the bride's friend had per-ordered for the group. We had drinks and appetizers flowing. The meatballs, lollipop and brussels sprouts were a hit.  I had a skinny apple-tini that was excellent.  We had brought gifts into the restaurant and the staff was ok with our bride opening them up. Mr. Brian Malarkey himself was in there last night and we got a chance to have him say hello to our group.  I had told him I had been to his location in San Diego and this was how we picked this spot for our party. The drinks were flowing and the food was great, the atmosphere charming, and Amy our server kept up with all 11 of us ladies quite well. I definitely will be back and recommend it to others to try."}
{"text":"Whoohoooo!! I hesitate to give this place 5 stars because it was so easy for me to get a reservation here, I don't want others to know about this gem of a restaurant.  But I shall share with you all my enthusiasm for this place. The food is unpretentious, well, at least by new American cuisine standards. Having recently dined at fellow Top Chef contestant Richard Blais' restaurant (Juniper & Ivy in San Diego) where I found the food to be very fun and creative, but lacking heart and taste/satisfaction, Chef Brian Malarkey's restaurant really knocked it out of the park for me. The food is simple, and instead of getting fancy, they focused on just preparing the food perfectly.   Of note, their duck breast confit was perfectly prepared. Not a single complaint. Even the bed of white beans it sits on top of was delicious, and I haaaaaate beans! Their scallop dish is priced a bit on the high side, but they give you three very decent-sized scallops, and again, it was made perfectly.  You must try their sweet and spicy squid. Even if you're not a fan of squid, this dish totally won me over. I don't know how they prepare it but the squid is not chewy at all. It's got a great texture that reminds me of scallops. Anyway you must try it.   The only disappointing dish was the short rib. Ugh. If I see short rib on one more menu I'm gonna scream, but the waiter recommended it. It was dry, bland, and boring. It even sat on top of a pile of boring mashed potatoes. Avoid this one.   I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I always give a place the benefit of the doubt when I read such mixed reviews.  If something is stellar, then it is worth paying for..  This was not stellar.  In fact, it was more miss than hit.  We had 4 appetizers - the habanero & pickle was interesting and I would recommend it.  The squid which was mediocre to poor.  The farm bird lollipops were just ok.  The tuna poke was the one dish that was stellar.  We each had a glass of wine and that came out to $70.  Definitely not worth it with so many other fabulous restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I watched every episode of The Taste and was so excited  to go to Searsucker Scottsdale Beautiful restaurant,staff so nice,Chris was an awesome waiter I had my heart set on the lobster roll,not on the menu anymore The guys wanted a domestic beer,none I think $11 for a glass of wine at lunch a little high Same wine 750 lt at store $15 The hand ground filet burger with pork belly was great I had the drunken chicken sandwich,very disappointing Too big for a lady to eat,dark meat in the sandwich So with the side salad served I basically had a chicken salad The food prices are a steal,liquor prices are over the top Good luck to the Malarky team"}
{"text":"We love searsucker.  Everything I've had here is delicious and on our last visit they put us at the kitchen table which was a blast.  The owner, Brian Malarkey, hung out with us and the chef brought over all sorts of food for us to try.   It was an awesome evening.  The atmosphere is fun and our service has always been spot on.  Great cocktails too.  This is a perfect place for girls night out."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed by our dining experience at Searsucker...there are so many better chef-driven restaurants in Scottsdale. Very trendy decor, but the dining experience just does not delivery. Chef Malarkey roamed the dining room promoting the Taste, but he would have better served his restaurant had he spent the evening in the kitchen.  The entire dining experience was rushed -- we were in and out for dinner in little more than and hour.  The eggs and bacon small plate was cold, which was sad because the flavors were promising. The chicken and waffles and franks small plate was also cold.  The filet was underwhelming.  The short rib small plate was redeeming. The duck fat fries were greasy and, again, cold. The brussel sprouts were, well, burnt, (not caramelized) and doused in vinegar.  It is disappointing that a meal that was so rushed, was served cold. The server was also not interested in our comments about dinner, disappointed we opted not to order dessert.  We will choose to dine elsewhere and skip the hype of Searsucker."}
{"text":"Thank you Searsucker for a wonderful evening!  This was our first trip to Searsucker and we LOVED it.  The atmosphere inviting, trendy and fresh.  Great addition to the Scottsdale area.  We were greeted with a group of smiles upon our arrival.  Had some drinks at the bar (the bar stools a little uncomfortable so moved to a nice seat in the deep seating area..) and then continued on to our table for dinner.  Our Brazilian/NewYorker server, Marcos took very good care of us focused on every detail to ensure we had a perfect dining experience.  He recommended just the right pairing of a full bodied Chilean cabernet to go with my filet. Friends had the salmon and scallops and they were divine.  Go and enjoy!  Can't wait to go again!  Well done Brian Malarkey!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! Everything from the service to the food was amazing. The overall atmosphere was so lively i will definitely be back to dine on my next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here without know what to expect, ended up with a new favorite spot.  I was a bit hesitant to go here, because Old Homestead is my absolute favorite restaurant and its literally around the corner from Searsucker.  I decided to change things up a bit and try this brand new spot at Caesars.  Started off with the eggs + bacon \"pork belly\"and it was outstanding, I highly suggest it, as it's quite a difference from your normal appetizer. Me and my mother split the tomahawk with a side of bacon grits, and I have to say this steak was unbelievable.  Was it as good as Homestead's ribeye?  Obviously this stuff is subjective, and I'm biased towards them,  but I'll definitely say it's up there, and a bit better than STK's ribeye.  Honestly one of the top 10 meals I've ever had, and we didn't even do dessert."}
{"text":"My expectations were high after reading about awards it's received.  Over-hyped should be their next.    Liked:  cool & swanky decor - drinks - short rib \"cali-belgique\"    Where things fell short: * The fried brussel sprouts should be renamed \"charred\" brussel sprouts.  I was debating between the brussel sprouts & the cauliflower.  My waiter pumped up the brussel sprouts and made them sound like heaven.  Then they came served black & crispy.  :-(  * The scallop diver surf & turf...where's the turf?  For real.  Don't advertise turf and serve flakes of corned beef with a $35 price tag for 3 scallops.  I better be wowed and just wasn't."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for business and had the pleasure of dining at Searsucker last Saturday night.  We had a 7:00 reservation and although the place was packed when we arrived we were seated right away at a really cozy table at the back of the restaurant.  Our server was really helpful and made some great recommendations.  We started with the warm spinach salad, which was absolutely delicious.  The hubby had the swordfish with a side of Cauliflower and I had the shrimp with a side of corn.  Everything that came out was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  My husband said it was the best fish he's ever had. Only regret is that we totally cleaned our plates and didn't have room to try any of the desserts.  Overall the experience was really great.  Good service without being pretentious, good drinks, and excellent food.  Will definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Loved it. Bartender very familiar with a \"quirky\" but wonderful menu. Had cowboy \"caviar\" (bull balls), spicy squid and an amazing pork belly & poached egg with hollandaise (talk about gilding the lily!). Best bacon eggs I've ever had. All very delicious. Wondering why the restaurant was so empty the evening I was there. Will recommend and return. If you're a foodie, want something a little different from mainstream boring menus, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Searsucker is for sure the hottest new restaurant in the valley... I had the Peter Rabbit, which i was told is one of their signiture cocktails.. it was amazing... i also had a few smalls.. the egg and bacon.. which it was describe as one of the best thing in this planet... brioche bread, top with pork belly and poach egg on a hollandense sauce.. my server didnt lie.. it was out of this world.. we aslo had the shrimp and grits..  which is server with buttermilk cheddar cheese grits. it was amazing.. Opah with Almonds and cherry and the Filet with the lobster butter are two of the best entrees me and my wife ever had...  to finish our night we had The King Sundae.. wow.... we were speechless.. awosme dessert..,  our server was very knowlodgeable and he guide us from the begging to the end of ojr meal.. best service ever.  we will be coming soon and letting all our friends know how great this place is..."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome!  Great vibe from the people and the food is delicious!! Definitely recommend the Bone Marrow to start and end with the Hanger steak. This place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner, and had the best time there! The mahi I had was so beautifully done, also loved the music and live dj they had, was a little warm for my boyfriend but hey it was busy. Overall this has become my new favorite restaurant in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Vegas!  Great cocktails and food. The mango mai Tai is a treat. Love this place so much we came back the next night!  You can get oysters by the piece, they come with a pomegranate mignonette that pairs so well with the creamy oysters. The biscuits with butter and bourbon infused honey are delish. The steak tartare was creative and tasty. I had the bone marrow the second night and it was amazing!  Perfectly cooked and the sweetness balanced the slight bitterness of the crispy Brussels sprouts. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable - the manager came by the table each night to make sure we were happy with our food. I highly anticipate my next visit to Vegas so we can eat there again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Restaurant week experiences I've had the pleasure of experiencing.  Must gets:  Bone Marrow app and Short Rib Main.  The cookie sandwich was also delish!"}
{"text":"Was going for shared plates menu. 6 person group with sometimes overlapping tastes. Menu offered nice selection of choices. Had 6 or 7. Ordered large plate of short rib. Prob favorite of group. Not sure why it wasn't busier since felt the food choices, quality and atmosphere and ultimately the location were 4 to 5 ratings in each category. Service was very attentive. If only had short time would recommend as food started arriving within couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Went with the Bestie to this spot and at first had trouble finding the entrance but entered a totally trendy, hip, casual restaurant.  LOVE the look of the dining room. LOVE how the \"warehouse\" ceilings are very high.  This place just looks so cool inside.  The bar is to the left and had people staged there and there are couches to just hang out with your drink.  The kitchen is open so you can see the cooks back there.  If your looking for an aesthetically eye-pleasing spot- go here. Service was great, our server was knowledgeable on the menu and ingredients, waters kept being refilled, and our table was checked on throughout the meal.  We started with the shrimp and grits app. (very good 5 decent shrimps), I ordered the mahi, and Mal ordered the chicken.  We both ordered a cocktail as well and those were VERY strong! My fish was a pretty large piece and had some horseradish sauce on top (meh- coulda done without it or at least on the side.)  The fish was cooked very well and I enjoyed it.  Mallory's chicken was a huge piece of like a breast, thigh, and mini-wing attached.  It looked so juicy!  She said it was very good and I got to try a piece and it was great.  The sides are a la carte so we chose mashed potatoes, and the cauliflower.  The cauliflower was really good and seasoned with lemon and other spices.  The mashed potatoes was blended so much it was almost soup.  I've had better potatoes. bill was 107.00 for the two of us. The meal was good and the place was very trendy.  If you have a birthday or other special celebration coming up totally go here."}
{"text":"Had Thanksgiving Dinner here yesterday. Our waitress Desiree was amazing. The food was fabulous.  But the reason I did not give them 5 stars is because the food was barely warm and the second on dressing was burnt. They did not offer to adjust anything. I did ask for hot gravy to warm up the dressing and meThey also charged extra for biscuits.  Overall it was a good experience.  Our first time here. Also finding the restaurant in Caesars was a Maze. There are no directions for the restaurant. Good luck if you go."}
{"text":"Went to SS for the first time last weekend. The menu was confusing for a steakhouse guy like myself, but the bartender Monica was outstanding and handled everything from cocktail to appetizer and entree selections. She nailed it! I'll definitely be back and hopefully she'll be there to save the day again. Best restaurant experience I've had in some time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overrated. The food is not as good as any Mastro's or Fox owned restaurant in my opinion. There are too many items on the menu so there isn't enough attention put on quality, so the food is just sub-par. The service was so-so. The best service we got was from the bus boy, he was hard working and very attentive. It took the waiter 10 minutes to come to our table and take drink orders, and they weren't that busy. The ambience is very nice however, wish the food matched. And the napkin is huge??? Won't be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I had the pleasure of going to the Friends and Family night at Searsucker Scottsdale. The restaurant is very large and open. It was a little cold where we were sitting, but beautifully decorated. They had a DJ spinning some great tunes. The vibe was very hip and upbeat. Here's what we had from the menu:   Cheddar Puffers - Meh Olives, garlic & heat - Yum! No shishito schoos peppers- Skip (no one liked these as they lacked flavor). Brie \"triple,\" grape jam, roasted grapes - Great for sharing. Everyone enjoyed. Shrimp \"spicy,\" bacon grits - A MUST ORDER! EVERYONE LOVED THIS! Mushrooms, burrata, toast - Delicious! Another table favorite. Beat, champagne, walnut & goat - Average salad. Nothing spectacular. Loin Filet with lobster butter & cognac - TABLE FAVORITE! Ribeye with cognac & horseradish - Everyone enjoyed it. (It's priced a little high though) Jalapeno-chorizo - Great side dish for sharing. Lots of flavor.  Fennel, fingerlings & yolk - Great for sharing. The yolk brings an interesting flavor.  We also had this chocolate mousse on top of a brownie with peanut butter ice cream and caramel. It wasn't on the menu, but it was excellent! Overall, I'd come back again, but stick with the small plates to share and bring a jacket!  **Make sure you order a Peter Rabit drink. It sounds a little strange, but it won't dissapoint!\"**"}
{"text":"Tammy pointed out our order and right off the bat was amazing. Jeasus made us super cozy and the food was to die for. I had the strawberry  salad, shrimp and grits and  crab cake. All me. All good."}
{"text":"Hmmmm - not sure how this place has won awards or was so busy the night we went.   We were greeted promptly and seated right away, always a plus. We were greeted by two different waiters - not a big deal as they were busy. BUT when our waiter came up to the table (and it's really loud so it was hard to hear him) we weren't ready to order drinks yet, and after greeting us he just walked away. Again, it was loud so I'm not sure if he said anything but it didn't look like it.  When he came back, we ordered drinks and asked about appetizers. He recommended the lollipops and was forthcoming with offering suggestions, which again was good.  The lollipops were minced up chicken meat rolled up and fried - extremely strange. They menu made it sound like they were more like skewers or chicken wings, not minced chicken meatballs. And the taste was off too, just a weird app.  Ordered the salad with strawberries - way too much dressing, I couldn't even finish it - should have gotten the dressing on the side :/.  My husband ordered the shrimp and grits that he shared with our friend, but again the taste was just off. He's from South Carolina and loves his shirmp and grits and orders it anytime he can. But he didn't even finish his portion.  I will not be visiting this place again, which was a disappointment because it looked so fun and the menu looked great. Oh well."}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas with the weekend planned...UNTIL SS!!! We went to SS with a group of friends, and my first gripe is the fact that they don't allow outside drinks. Yep, toss that Fat Tuesday out! Its Vegas and for a pretty pricey-not so amazing- restaurant the \"no outside drink\" rule is obnoxious. Second and even worse, my beau got the FISH and CHIPS and GOT FOOD POISONING as a result! I think his meal was not only around $30-40 but then it made him very very sick. And he got sick to the point where we had to cut the rest of our Vegas plans short because he had to be treated for his food poisoning. And NO, HE DOESNT DRINK SO IT WAS NOT ANY REACTION TO ALCOHOL! Third, I was at a table with about 14 people and several people sent back their food because it was salty! No go with salty and over priced meals! Anyway, BYPASS this Cesars not so royal restaurant! METHINKS NOT EVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Space is nice but very sparse (ie very few patrons here on a Saturday night). Food and service were nice, but not special in any way. Beautiful bathrooms.   The DJ played outdated techno music. Apparently it is not an establishment that allows current dance music or hip hop. In fact, the DJ said Management would never allow him to play Snoop Dog or Warren G.  I freakin love Warren G. It's Searsucker's loss, unfortunately. The sounds of Warren G cross through cultures and generations. Oh well."}
{"text":"I really liked the meal I had here. I started off with the field greens and pear salad which was very good. The goat cheese was smeared across one side of plate then salad placed on side. I had never seen that before and it was sorta good but also made me think, what if they just didn't wash this plate? Lol As main course had the beer braised short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes. That was delicious, I had been on a no carb diet and eating those potatoes was like eating a rainbow for me. Very tasty. I didn't really get the 3 onion rings on top 1 would have been plenty but didn't think it really went with rest of dish.   For dessert had the milk and cookies which was amazing and couldn't finish them all so got some for breakfast snack.  My server was great."}
{"text":"This place have mediocre food that is grossly over priced. There are much better options around the Vegas strip. The only plus for this restaurant was that there was no wait to get in while other places had 1-2 hour wait. Now i know why."}
{"text":"I just went to searsucker today for brunch and I can't tell you how much I love that place!!! Our awesome waitress Cindy couldn't have been more helpful! The first thing she suggested was the Peter Rabbit cocktail...amazing!!! I purchased the cookbook that had the recipe in it and went straight to the store to pick up the ingredients to make them at home!!! The pork belly egg dish was also so good and the portions are generous. I can't wait to go back! Ask to sit in Cindy's section you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Five stars might be an under statement for Searsucker. The first impression is the design...unique and clever...it is inviting and comfortable all while being hip.  The host staff was just as inviting with warm smiles and a true display of hospitality.  There was a short wait for my table so I decided to enjoy a craft cocktail.  I had the Peter Rabbit .  Anyone that dines at Searsucker MUST drink one...that is if they have the will power to indulge in  only one.  I was seated and served by Lorie.  Great energy and fun.  I ate shrimp & grits as an app and for my entree the pork butt.  All out of this world delicious.  I will be going back soon.  Scottsdale needed this place badly...it is a great departure from all the average chain style dining in the valley."}
{"text":"After hearing about Searsucker in San Diego with Top Chef's Brian Malarkey we couldn't wait to try Searsucker when it opened here in Arizona. We saw a Groupon and decided to try it right away. If you haven't been, it is in an odd location in the edge of the mall. You have to mark at Neman Marcus or pay $5 to valet. In our opinion, if you don't have a parking lot for your restaurant, you shouldn't charge for valet, or at least validate. Also, I must admit the statues of animals out front are not our taste, but that didn't stop us from being opened minded about the food.   That being said, the first thing we tried was the cheese bread they give you before you order. We thought it was overly spicy and not very good. We hoped the tapas would be better.  We decided to go with a few different tapas. We tried: 1. Meatballs - These were the best thing we tried. They are homemade meatballs in a tomato basil sauce. They are very nice, but they only give you 5 small meatballs in an order. 2. Tuna Poke - This wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. It also wasn't tuna poke. It was more  like a tuna tartare that looked like cat food. It wasn't fishy or anything seriously wrong with it, but there was nothing that stood out about it either. I've had it better at many other places.  3. Duck Fat Fries - These were very heavy and not very good. You could taste the duck fat and it was overwhelming. We've had these at other places and enjoyed them much better. The tomato jam that came with it was sort of pretentious and not very enjoyable. I would have rather had ketchup. 4. Cobb Salad - This was by far the worst thing we ordered. The dressing was some sort of cross between ranch and blue cheese and was super watery. Gross. The bacon came in the biggest pieces I've ever seen and basically took over the whole salad. The avocado wasn't fresh and it just left much to be desired. I could have had a better cobb salad from the Cheesecake Factory.  5. Scallop - The scallop was cooked perfect, but the sauce was too sweet and overwhelmed the taste of the scallop. If you like that sweet asian sauce on your scallops, then this was good, but it was too much for us.   I'd say the food here was very average at best. The reason I didn't not give Searsucker 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the prices. Everything is extremely expensive and for it just being OK, it is just not worth it. We won't be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Service is on point, the sangria is delicious!!!!! chops is Phenomenal!!!! We received VIP service and the food is out of this world good!!!! The beef tar tar with the quail egg and the pork belly toast and poached egg were to die for!!!! I will absolutely be back! I loved everything about this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service was very good. We ordered several shareables and had plenty of food for four people: Mac & Cheese was excellent and the chicken sliders were some of the best I've had. The biscuits - seriously amazing and not to be missed. I didn't love the duck fat fries, they didn't have as much flavor as I expected."}
{"text":"Wow. That's all I can say. I am a fairly picky eater and my friend was like, just try it. First off the homemade cheese puffs are on point. We had the peppers which were sweet and spicy at the same time. Then the pork butt came out. Name threw me off but was so good. The finale was the chocolate chip cookies. You will never have a better cookie in your life."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. We made reservations weeks in advance for dinner for a bachelor/bachelorette party for 12 people. Any smart restaurant manager would have that ready and waiting because it is an easy $1000 tab. We got there and waited for 25 minutes and the little snot hostess told us they are cleaning the table for 25 minutes. I asked what is going on that we had a reservation and they are not honoring it, she replied with extreme attitude. I have been several times to the Searsucker in San Diego and loved it so we were excited to celebrate and dine here with our friends. I will never return to eat at this location, as a restaurant manager myself I have never come across such an unprofessional establishment. Shame on you Las Vegas Searsucker."}
{"text":"Now added to the list of restaurants I'll return to in Vegas. I was on business; would consider it pricey otherwise. Knowledgeable professional server made the evening. Biscuits - yum. Peppers also very good. I had the Mexican shrimp with asparagus and was completely satisfied. Cozy atmosphere - a little noise, but not terrible for Vegas. Had a fun vibe with well done food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went back 2 nights in a row! What brought us back was the strawberry jalapeño margarita (SO good) but we also tried several dishes. All were amazing. Ambience is modern with a fun twist."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Everything we had was delicious. Our bartender Adrian was extremely friendly and insightful about the menu. I highly recommend the \"infused\" cocktails and the s'mores dessert."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not blown away, a little over priced for the serving sizes. Service was alright, friendly, but server forgot some of our order, never wrote anything down. There is room for improvement here. The take on the chicken and waffle small plate was the best thing going. That was very good."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door you are aware you are in the 'ultimate of cool' hot spot of the moment.  Four girls in super tight black outfits and 5\" heels greet you as they did on opening night.   We were followed in by a fellow with a partially shaved head with spaced 'poodle' balls of hair and no one seemed to notice.   Note: they need a little grammar lesson; the girl asked us \"Are you ready to be SAT ? \"  Before dinner we had a cocktail at their fabulous bar; our bartender Chris was absolutely The Best!   I inquired about their 'infused' vodkas, and since he could tell we were interested, were told they make them on premises and then told us the entire process, and gave us some tastes.  He took the time to make our drinks meaningful! The very berry vodka martini was delicious!  As usual, the 'cool' element is accompanied by a noise level which had the 3 of us screaming across the table, coupled with sitting near the kitchen.  Those guys were on fire back there, sounding like they just delivered karate chops instead of entrees.    The menu is initially confusing, as all plates just list 2 or 3 of the ingredients, accompanied by a 'plus' sign.  But let me say, the food is absolutely delicious and we loved every bite!   We had Tim as our waiter and he was also The Best!  - patient, friendly, knowledgeable, just a sweetheart!  We had 3 salads and 3 entrees but next time we'll be more adventurous with the small plates.  Swordfish with drunken cherries was a '10' as were the briussel sprouts.    Brian Malarkey is a hard-working genius of cuisine and restaurant concepts.   We have eaten at Burlap, Gabardine, and Herringbone, 3 of his restaurants in San Diego, many times, and it's always an entertaining atmosphere, coupled with good food!"}
{"text":"I like the decor and vibe at this restaurant. The cocktails were pretty good. I went with the Skinny Jenny and then had a champagne cocktail.   The hamachi appetizer is excellent. The beef tartar was also good. It could have used more quail egg.   My boyfriend and I split the Tomahawk ribeye. I was so excited for this, but it was lackluster. Especially for an $85 steak. I found it to be tough and too fatty. And to the smart ass (Erik S) who called out that I should get a clue about a ribeye being fatty, I understand that the fat is what makes a ribeye delicious but when half the steak is fat I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I've had plenty of ribeye steaks that are more meaty. My review, my opinion.   My friend had the pork belly entree and said the flavors were good, but it was too rich to eat more than half of it. Pork belly is rich so you have to be in the mood for it.   This place is worth a try, but I'm not running back."}
{"text":"Really wouldn't waste a trip here again. We waited at our table for about 8-10 minutes before even being greeted by our server. Then, when he did come, he just asked if we were ready; didn't ask if we wanted drinks or explain the menu at all.   We ordered the mushrooms and burrata: it was good. The mushrooms were nicely seasoned but that's about it. We then ordered the shrimp and grits; nothing special. The food runner did great explaining the dishes though, so that was a plus. They then dropped off the lollipops (which we didn't order). I stated that we did not order them and the guy said that they were on the house. We weren't sure why. We tried 2 of them and weren't impressed so we just had them take them back. Our server then informed us that whomever dropped them at the table, made a mistake, so they really weren't \"on the house\" or compliments of anyone; it was just a mistake.   Based on the two starters, we quickly decided not to waste the money on an entree. We ordered the ermagerd sundae and continued to wait for about 20-25 minutes before getting it. Really?! Being a pastry chef, it was obvious that everything in that dish was premade and just needed to be thrown together. The server came over after about 15 minutes to apologize and tell us that the person who makes the desserts also makes the salads and was in the weeds because of a large party. We got it about 10 minutes later. It was ice cream and two baby brownie bites and bananas; there's nothing bad you can really say about it.  The service really killed the experience. For two of us that work at a semi-fine dining restaurant in Chicago, we really expected more, but weren't that surprised. These places turn over thousands of guests, and it was apparent that they had that mentality. We wanted to spend a good penny here and order a bunch off the menu, but it all just started so poorly. Kinda a shame .."}
{"text":"The food was excellent food! Really tasty. Albacora with procciuto and quinoa were my favorits"}
{"text":"I received a birthday offer from my work. The small plates were all amazing, the shishito peppers and shrimp scampi were amazing. I suggest this restaurant at my job as a great date night option!"}
{"text":"Since we heard this was a restaurant by a celebrity chef, we've been wanting to try it out. We finally had the opportunity this past weekend to go along with family from out of town. We were in a big group and we expected longer wait times to get our food. The service was great but that's about it based on our experience. I ordered the seared tuna, which was recommended by the waiter. Boy was this tuna a big disappointment! It was overcooked and dry. It was like eating a flavorless dry chicken. Other people in the group who ordered the same were overcooked as well. I even tried other seafood dish ordered by other people like the shark, which turned out to be overcooked and salty to no surprise. For the prices of these entrees one would expect a much pleasurable dining experience. But this was not the case at all! To top off the bad experience, the group had to witnessed two cockroaches crawling up and down the surrounding drapes!  I'm not the type that normally write Yelp reviews, but this experience was bad enough for me to vent my frustration."}
{"text":"Everything about this place says Cool. The vibe and decor is rustic yet modern. The long wooden tables make it feel homey yet trendy.  All of the food is fantastic- shishito peppers, biscuits, chicken, steak, shrimp..   Everyone was very happy with what they had!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday night and it was very quiet.  Sat in the bar and ordered cocktails until the rest of our party showed up.  Wanted to try a signature cocktail but in the end I opted for a cosmo. My hubs ordered a martini- dry up with olives.  He said there was something sweet to it.  They serve a cheesy bread type thing with the cocktails.  I'm not a big bread eater but tried one and it was ok.  Now on to the food.  I ordered the tongue in cheek which was the beef cheek.  It was very good but a little on the salty side and I like salt.  I also ordered the brussel sprouts which were tasty.  My friend ordered the salmon which she said was good.  There was also an order of  eggplant which I thought was delicious and seasoned just right.  Came in a small cast iron skillet.  Perfect size for a light meal and pipping hot.  I also tried a mushroom dish with toast but I don't recall what it was called.  It was very good.  This place has a cool vibe and the service was very good.  Not the very best meal I have ever had but I would certainly come back here.  It is sort of in a weird spot in the bottom of an office building."}
{"text":"As a southerner, searsucker represents classic southern charm and sophistication. This place was definitely shooting for that theme of country chic I guess you could say. They had decorated with pallet wall accents and some food was served in mason jars. The menu (especially apps) seemed to be twists on traditional southern favorites. We had the beef tartare and it was served in a mason jar with a wooden spoon. It came with crunchy toast and a small bowl of insanely good spicy pickles. The tartare hit the mark for sure. We got the pear and goat cheese salad which was also quite delicious. We ordered cocktails and wine during our meal and the service was definitely on point. We didn't wait for anything and our waitress checked in frequently. For the entree we got the swordfish grilled plain (there is an option for sauce that I skipped) and we got the shortrib. The shortrib was excellent although not the best I have ever had. But I can say the only place that ever beat it was a small farm to table restaurant in our hometown. The swordfish was lacking. Maybe I should have gone with a choice of sauce with it but I am a minimalist when it comes to food choosing to really taste the freshness and the quality of a meat over the accoutrements. It was a little over cooked but the side of Brussels was some of the best I've ever tasted. It came with an assortment of roasted peppers that were very tasty as well. We got the duck fat fries as a side for the shortrib and these are a must!   The atmosphere is a mix of country meets Vegas and it comes off a little weird to me. The theme could have been pushed a little more to really drive it home but I understand this is a Caesars palace restaurant and the type of customer it caters to. I can say that the bathroom attendants were very pushy and overbearing but that has nothing really to do with the food. Overall...this is a great restaurant with some unique twists on dishes. I wouldn't say it's spectacular and we did have better food for the same price (around $200 for two people). But I am definitely not regretful we tried it....the beef tartare, pickles, duck fat fries and service made it worth the experience."}
{"text":"Smart design, talented presentation, and amazing flavor profiles. Not for the chain restaurant goer. A welcomed gastronomical feat in the gate if old town without a plastic scene. Bravo."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place last night and it was amazing! There's a tricky first step to get into the restaurant, so watch out for that.   On to the food, I ordered the flank steak and my wife ordered the chicken. The food was absolutely delicious, one of the best meals I've ever eaten in Las Vegas.   Our server did such a great job, took care of us and was on top of everything. Great vibe, food and service."}
{"text":"My recent visit for lunch left me chuckling! I arrived and took a seat at the bar since I was dining solo.  Another couple was at the bar.  A very sweet bartender took my order.  She couldn't answer any questions, though, because it was her first day serving lunch.  Nice job training staff. I ordered wine, a simple salad with lemon vinaigrette, and the chicken meatballs.  Quite a bit of time went by when I overheard the manager apologizing to the couple at the bar because the kitchen fired chicken meatballs for them instead of regular meatballs.  She gave them the dish gratis. Yep, they were my meatballs. The bartender figured it out and admitted to me--no apology or even a word from the manager.  Then my food came out-both the salad and meatballs together.  Could it hurt to train the server to ask if you want both served together? I ate the meatballs first, which is a good thing because they were barely warm.  They were kind of tasty, but had a Costco prefab texture. The salad was inedible due to copious amounts of salt thrown on it.  Bartender finally asked me how everything was, and I told her that the salad was inedible and the chicken meatballs (while I ate them all because I was starving) were barely even warm.  Manager came over immediately, apologized and said they would fix the salad and comp the meatballs.  I told her that I would pay since I ate them, but she insisted. She went on to say that they were probably not that warm because they rushed to get them out and probably didn't cook them long enough. Eeeek!! Did I just eat undercooked chicken? Well, I didn't get sick so I'm guessing my thought that they were \"pre-fab Costco\" type meatballs is probably correct.  They are possibly pre-made, pre-cooked and just warmed up when ordered.  For $12 for 5 tiny meatballs--unacceptable. The restaurant is attractive inside, but there were a number of workers sitting at community tables doing paperwork--they were obviously not customers. This is a pet peeve of mine.   For the hype, the price, and the parking hassle, I don't think I would bother giving Searsucker another try.  Oh by the way, the second salad came out perfect.  Simple fresh greens, a little radish, and lemon vinaigrette. Hard to understand how they screwed it up the first time."}
{"text":"You have to be kidding me! All the buzz about this place is way over rated!  The best part of the place is the place itself. Cool design, innovative, comfortable (if you overlook the AC running at 65 F).  Short and poor selection of wines, the menu doesn't make sense, the deserts are poor executed, service barely OK and all of this with a way overpriced tag.  Cheese bread at the beginning was good, probably the best executed dish (puzzle face).  I had a glass of a French wine which had one of the most awkward wine tastes I've ever tried, but again, the selection is not that great.  In their web they have a beet salad but I didn't find it in the menu. It seems that they replaced the beets for strawberries. When I asked why, apparently beets are out of season. (Really? I'm not a farmer, but I had beets last weekend in another restaurant, oh well). Salad was barely average.  Then I had the marrow bone. It was OK, I was expecting a little more of a flavor from the onion jam and the bread used was kind of boring for such a dish.  For desert I had the rum and coke. It should be called sweet bread. No taste of rum or coke what so ever. Just a spongy bread super sweet with whipped cream on the side with an unknown flavor and a jelly with a hint of lime.  I also tried the doughnuts with chocolate. The doughnuts (bites) were crunchy (in a bad way) and the chocolate was more in the side of dark than milk, so didn't love them either.  There was a guitar player for all the three tables and 4 people that were at the bar. When he was gone, a DJ started spinning tunes for the whole 7 tables and 3 people at the bar that were there when I left.  It will be hard to make me go back ever.  There're plenty of places where you will do way better for this kind of money."}
{"text":"Pass on this place.  Bad attitude and POOR manners by the hostess.  Loud venue, drafty.  Brunch menu very limited.  I give it one year."}
{"text":"First time at Searsucker and it did not disappoint. Get the classic old fashioned, it is a great drink especially if prepared by Heather, a great bartender.  Get the burger and chipotle ketchup. Only 20 burgers are sold/made daily and it's worth every bite. Great place, great vibe, and great people there."}
{"text":"Dang good. Dannnnnnng good. Went with some buddies. All got different entres and all were top notch. Got beer braised short ribs. Beef was so tender i never picked up my knife. Did I say dang good? Lindsey was super on her game. Knew the menu, made the experience top notch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and a snack here on a Sunday evening.  I was thinking of going to the steak house, but the menu prices scared me away.  So I sat at the bar and had a drink and biscuits.  The drink - a \"Smoked Old Fashioned\" was really great.  Just fruity enough, a bit of campfire taste.  I also had a Long Island, which was adequate.  I ordered the appetizer biscuits, and I wasn't disappointed, but I was burned.  Literally - they arrived on a cast iron skillet and I burned my arm reaching over the skillet for my drink.  Didn't notice then, but the next day I had a blister on my arm, and it's still healing two weeks later.  But I contacted them (which wasn't easy, text messages or facebook page eventually found me the \"security department\" who relayed my message), and I was satisfied with their response; hopefully they will cover the handles in the future.  Because the biscuits were really, really tasty.  The only other strikes were the staff grumbling to each other about how hard it is to find a good job in Vegas, and the lingering stench of 50-some years of cigarettes and sorrow in the carpets outside in the casino I had to walk through to get there."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, yummy drinks and a bargain happy hour - what more could you want?   The first time we went we missed happy hour, but went anyway because we were hungry. We had the short ribs (to die for!), mushrooms on toast and drinks. The waiter very sweetly brought us a dessert on the house because of missing happy hour - it was delightful, as thoughtful things always are!  Went back the next night for happy hour, and tried to eat them out of house and home. Duck fat fries were outstanding, more short ribs, cheese puffs, a couple of salads, shrimp and grits - everything was on point and delicious, plus bargain priced. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and food is just ok! I rather spend money across the street at City Hall.  Wierd Menu....drinks are ok.  Not impressed with food and service."}
{"text":"Amazing in every way. We came around 5:15pm and walked into their Happy Hour (5-7p) and fell in love with the place. We ordered the shishito peppers, Bone Marrow, Tomahawk Steak with roasted mushrooms with herbs and the Walnut Brussel Sprouts. Definitely sit at the bar, it starts to get busy around 6p. Amazing food, awesome drinks and SPECTACULAR SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Searsucker never disappoints. The filet I had was amoung the best I've had. The staff was friendly and the service outstanding."}
{"text":"I had dinner and the food was great. Highly recommend this place if you're in Vegas. it's not outrageously priced and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"After unwelcoming reception at Old Homestead, we opted to sit at the bar at Searsucker.  Living in San Diego for the last 20 years, am well acquainted with Brian Malarkey's hospitality style and it mates up VERY nicely with the Las Vegas \"thang\".  The entire joint was jumpin' at 6:45 pm(Happy Hour daily 5:00-7:00 pm) on 1/21/17, Heather was our mixologist/server and we were instantly happy and relaxed.  I picked the \"Blueberry Ginger Smash\"-Old Forester / ginger / honey / blueberry / mint($8.00)...it was tremendous, packed a punch and had great flavor.  My friend had the Ballast Point beer, can't remember which flavor or how much it cost.  For eats, we had the Sliders($9.00 for two/order two, you'll want it!)-chipotle / cheddar / bacon....like a chipotle aoli topping, the beef was a nice size, two/three bites, juicy and flavorful....very, very nice, will be watching in the future to see if that stays on the menu.  We also got the tuna tacos ($9.00 for three) which were equally dilish!-blackend ahi / avocado/ jalapeno relish.  Deep fried shell, very thin and perfectly seasoned....highly recommended.  A word about Heather.....funny, smart and on her game, she will be sure to go far by reading the signs a customer is giving and paying attention to the small details.  Awesome person and Searsucker is lucky to have her!  Any Yelper in the vicinity of Caesar's should check this joint out and have a great time.  My experience was virtually without any fault, get to it!  Ambiance/Cleanliness-no bs here, it was good to go from the moment we sat down!...5 stars  Service- very nice, no major problems......4 stars  Food-see above for a food review, it was very good, but not in that rarified five star experience....a well deserved....4 stars!"}
{"text":"What a bummer. Took some friends back after a fantastic first-time experience at Searsucker and ended up with some major disappointments.   What was still good: Most of the food, ambiance, drinks.  What I learned this time that I didn't know last time: Happy Hour pricing is a gimmick and only available at the bar.  What slipped this time: - The duck fat fries - for lack of a more eloquent way to put it - sucked. It was my FAVORITE dish and I was so eager to order it again. I was the uber hype woman for this dish. Imagine my disappointment and frankly embarrassment when my friends tried it along with me and found it to taste exactly like normal fries. No more savory/umami flavors. I asked the waitress what's up. She said they switched over to fresh not frozen fries recently. I'm not a food chemist so I can't say if that affected the taste of what but it was night and day. I would not order this again. - The buffalo wings are midget (ahem, I mean 'size challenged'). Super duper tiny. - Service. Our waitress was present, but sometimes we had to wait awhile for her to come around, otherwise we didn't see her at all. May not be her fault in a busy part of the restaurant. She was also brusque and a little sarcastic, which I didn't anticipate given the warm service we received the first time by someone else. - Website says you can get complimentary entry to Omnia. We asked about it on the way out. Turns out you need to buy a certain amount of food for each complimentary entrance, which is reasonable. What bemused me was that it took them about 10 minutes to sign off this perk for us. Required a manager's approval so we had to wait.  Don't know what happened this time, but the allure definitely faded. If this was my first experience at Searsucker, I would not have returned."}
{"text":"Awesome! Tried Searsucker last night for the first time. Can't wait to go back!! Try the Peter Rabbit, even if you think you don't like Gin. It's terrific! The shishito peppers are terrific, too! The 63 degree egg was absolutely scrumptious- the best breakfast ever!! We really enjoyed the rest of the meal, as well. Everything was done perfectly and the service was top notch. Thanks, Tim!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place on the strip. Drinks are awesome and happy hour specials are perfect. Give it a try if you're nearby."}
{"text":"3 things to recommend off the menu: the bone marrow, scallops, and the rocky road bread pudding"}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals of my life at Searsucker on this trip to Vegas. The atmosphere is amazing, the servers were awesome, and amazing at accommodating my gluten allergy! Can't recommend this place highly enough. Holy wow the meal was seriously so good - if/when i go back, I don't even know what I'll order because everything was so amazing!! Our favorite dishes of the night:   Drinks: - Strawberry Jalapeno (if you like spicy margaritas, get this!!) - Fizzy Lifter  Dinner: - Short rib with horseradish potatoes - Roasted cauliflower with pickled chilis, pine nuts, citrus - Heirloom roasted carrots with thai pesto and crushed peanuts - Scallops over kabocha squash puree, caramelized mushrooms, butternut squash and bacon bits - 36 - Salmon with white bean ragout and herbs - 29  Also. For dessert, we had the daily scoop - mango sorbet and salted caramel ice cream (or gelato)? AMAZING."}
{"text":"Wow, where to begin...  I was lucky enough to go to Searsucker with a large party of people. I say \"lucky\" because this allowed me to try a lot of different menu items.   First things first, though the seating and the vibe are perfect for large parties, the restaurant is extremely loud. Also, we were seated at a long, rectangular table, so in order to speak to someone across the way, you either had to shout or temporarily move seats. This made for a difficult dining experience conversation-wise.  However, I have relatively no complaints about the food. Though I would like to mention that I was tricked into eating a Rocky Mountain Oyster (bleh, yuck). For all of you sweet, innocent souls out there (like myself) that have no idea what Rocky Mountain Oysters are, please read the following statement; they are testicles. That's right. If the idea of eating such a thing makes you squeamish, then do not order the Cowboy Caviar. I honestly cannot attest to the taste, as my opinion is now completely jaded by the fact that I had never, ever wanted to eat bull testicles in my life. Ever.   Moving on; I personally ordered the Duck Fat Fries with Chipotle Ketchup. This was, of course, delicious because...well, because it's fries all done up fancy and such. I also enjoyed the smoky ketchup, and I'm not necessarily a fan of chipotle in the first place. Along with the fries, I ordered the Tomato Soup with Toast and Cheese (AKA, grilled cheese). Yum, yum, yum was it good. The soup is drizzled with some sort of pesto sauce on top. The grilled cheese is greasy, melty, and super-cheesy in all of the ways that matter. Finally, I also ordered the \"Spicy\" Shrimp Bacon Grits. And I died...from deliciousness. Wow. For all of you that are wary of spicy foods, I would say the spiciness level is \"medium\". It's slightly hotter than mild, but not too hot. In the picture I've supplied, it looks very different from how you'd expect grits to look but rest assured, they're there - under all that shrimp and sauce and delicious flavor.   As a party, we also ordered the Hamachi Tostadas, the Artichoke Hearts with Cheddar and Mozzarella, the Brussels Sprouts and the Scallops (entree). Of all of those, I particularly enjoyed the artichoke dip the best. It comes with cheesy toast, as you can see in the picture.   All in all, eating at Searsucker was quite the experience. I only wish I had heard about it when I was still living in San Diego, as they also have a location there. Hopefully Reno will get one eventually as well! It's definitely a must-try.  Happy feasting!"}
{"text":"Was here with a group of 8 people in which we decided to do family style dining and order several different things and just share. I'm sad to say the best thing I had that night was their Duck Fat Fries and the Cheddar Puffers. The item I was most looking forward to was the Tomahawk Ribeye but it was over-salted, which seemed to be a theme for them that night. I also tried the Duck which was nothing special and the Mahi which was tough and flavorless.   Honestly the only reason they got two stars was that their cocktails were very well done and the half priced bottles of wine for locals.   Overall I'm not in any hurry to return or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to Searsucker twice now and I am very, very impressed.  My first visit was during one of their friends and family nights, where much to my delight everything was \"on the house\". My girl friend and I enjoyed a glass of white wine and one of their signature Peter Rabbit cocktails. I wasn't a huge fan of the Peter Rabbit, but to be honest I don't usually have mixed cocktails like that with dinner. Admittedly it was a little too \"advanced\" for my palette ;) The bartender who took care of us was very friendly and knowledgeable, and perhaps most important - not offended that I didn't care for the drink.  As far as nibbles, we sampled the \"no shishito\" peppers, spicy pickles, bone marrow, and eggs & bacon pork belly. I had never eaten bone marrow before and while I was intimidated a little bit, I thought it was tasty. The eggs & bacon pork belly, however, hit it out of the park. Delicious, melt in your mouth!   For our entree we shared the diver scallops. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I am a sucker for scallops, and these were exceptional. It escapes me now what they were accompanied with, but it doesn't matter because they were so scrumptious. Just do yourself a favor and order them.  My second visit to Searsucker was on a Sunday for brunch. I was shocked to find a less than half empty restaurant, what with it being a lovely sunny day and a DJ playing fun music. Anyway, I opted for the $15 bottomless mimosa deal, while my friends sipped on some fancy-pants bloody mary's. For food I selected the \"green eggs and ham\" which was their infamous pork belly on brioche toast, eggs, and herb infused saucy deliciousness. Needless to say I practically licked my plate.  Service, atmosphere, and food are all excellent! A+ :)"}
{"text":"My first time at this place was amazing. Service was awesome. I was so excited to come back to Vegas to eat at Searsucker. It was such a disappointment. We went during happy hour on Wednesday. We sat and waited for a server. We ended up going to the bar for menus where the bartender said our server would be with us shortly. After waiting 15 minutes we ended up ordering at the bar. The place wasn't busy. In fact, I saw a couple employees standing at the bar. When our food came out it was delivered by someone who worked in the kitchen, we had to ask him for silverware and plates. Nobody ever checked in on us and we ended up going to the bar again to ask for our check. This place was one of my favorite stops when I visited and has become the only bad experience on my vacation. :("}
{"text":"We ate dinner at 8PM on May, 23, 2013. I really had high hopes for this high end happening restaurant. I made reservation for a table of 5 and told the reservationist that we had another party of 5 under my friend's name. We were part of a meetup group that loves food and came together for AZ Restaurant week to eat and socialize.I don't know why but the reservation person at Searsucker called my friend over the phone and pressured her to agree to making our 2 separate reservation into 1.Meaning our party of 8 would be seated at a long table. When I arrived, I was shock to find out we were seated all together at one long table. By this point, everyone had already gotten comfortable so we decided to stay put enduring the tight space even though the restaurant was half empty!!!!  There's more!! I was not given a napkin nor a glass of water till I ask 2 times for it.  I ate my appetizer, entrée, and half of my dessert before I got the napkin I asked for.  Our party waited at least 30 minutes, before anyone came to get our order.  The air conditioning was not working well that day and so we were sitting there sweating.  I notice, the table next to us was also fanning themselves with the menu. If you are reading this Searsucker, please write me back at xxxxxxxx  and I will make sure to contact you right away. Thank you for reading this review."}
{"text":"My boss recommended this place to me because he had heard great reviews from the one in SD. Decided to have my birthday dinner here and overall the food was remarkable. The mussels with chorizo were amazing, the chorizo bits were so tasty gave the whole dish an amazing taste. The squid sweet heat was probably the best squid I have had and this tends to be a dish I order at every restaurant and is by far the best tasting here at Searsucker. All of the appetizers came in large sizes. We also got the duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup towards the end, and OMG, loved them! I'm not a duck fan but you really couldn't taste duck. I got the mahi baja dish the meat was so tender and those almonds and drunken cherries just blended in very well in every bite. My boyfriend got the hanger butcher steak and he thought it was okay. The only disappointing thing and the reason why I didn't give five stars is because the entree is literally just the piece of meat, the dishes don't come with anything else like a side. Good thing we had ordered the duck fat fries along with the entrees. Their cocktail ballerina and the czar was good. To end the dinner our awesome waitress recommended the s'mores bar for dessert, so glad she did! Not one crumb was left of that. Oh, not to mention the service was great our waiter was so friendly and kept checking up on us to make sure our experience was going great, she even started a conversation with us and mentioned how she loved locals coming into Searsucker."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff (super attentive) food was on point. I've never felt more welcomed at a restaurant before. I would highly recommend the strawberry jalapeño margaritas so D'lish!!! Definitely coming back with all my friends and family again ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we should have known things would not be outstanding based on the crowd. It was completely dead!!!!! We stopped in for quick appetizers and drinks before omnia. Drinks were delicious and decently priced. Food, not so good! Jars on the menu is quite literal... The food comes in s jar. We ordered about 6 appetizers for 5 girls and that was enough. I absolutely loved the crab and avocado but that's about it. Beef tartare came up short, as did the tuna tartare and honestly the rest of the food was so mediocre I can't even remember what else we ordered. The scene is cute and it's a great location but not really up to par with the competition."}
{"text":"Walk. Don't walk. That's the sign at the entrance. Much like a pedestrian crossing light. This place must be fun! The hostesses were welcoming and promptly offered an invite into the restaurant. Once my friend arrived we were shown inside by the lovely Stephanie who showed us the bar and the kitchen area, as well as our \"people watching seats\". It's nice to see the kitchen operation in action. Everything the chefs were working on looked fresh.  Desiree was our server. She came to us right away to welcome us and brought the Happy Hour menus. We had about 15 minutes before their Happy Hour was over so we promptly ordered four cocktails and 2 appetizers. The cocktails were crafty and delicious. The fuck dat fries, sorry the Duck Fat Fries with chipotle ketchup had just the right combination of flavors, they were pulpy, fresh and crispy, not too spicy (thank goodness for me!). I couldn't taste the duck but they were delish nonetheless . The short rib \"the harlot\" though was soooo freaking good! It was tender and juicy and the mashed potatoes and the crispy onions OMG I could eat like 3 or 4 or 5 of those orders! Yumm! We followed with the strawberry walnut goat cheese salad, Wow great combination of textures, with fruit and crunchiness and fresh greens. Then the Tuna albacore wrapped in prosciutto, sherry alioli and balsamic balls (gooey balls, yumm!) with a delicious Frisée salad, barely seared but definitely rear tuna (sashimi grade for sure!) was sooooooo good! The tuna just melts in your mouth! By then I was starting to feel full but I couldn't stop eating it. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the chocolate chip cookies looked finger licking good. Desiree was super friendly and informative and kept us entertained in between dishes. She made some excellent recommendations. You could tell she enjoys talking about the different menu items and how much she loved trying them all during pre-opening. If you are lucky enough to get Desiree during your visit, you will be a pampered guest! Her assistant Ahi (Aji?) (I called him Ajilipollas) was friendly and always kept our water glasses topped. I can't wait to visit Searsucker again so I can try the other items I wish I could've eaten today. I'm no terminator but \"I'll be back!\"."}
{"text":"Hubby and I shared the pork belly and the short rib small plates. I Loved the Pork belly. We also ordered 2 desserts. The alexis michelle terrine and the ranndy jackson presents: \"the sundae\". Both were really good but OMG the sundae was so delicious the bacon caramel popcorn was a unique idea and was such a great addition to the dish."}
{"text":"I had high hopes Searsucker but left disappointed. The atmosphere was industrial blended with chic touches.  The serves was average to poor, we saw our waitress three times over two hour span and one of those was to drop the check. Plus, I did not have the opportunity to get a second drink let alone a refill on water.   We ordered several small plates, Cobb salad, and the Randy Jackson dessert. Of the small plates we ordered, Brussels sprouts, chorizo corn, peppers, duck fries, and chicken and waffles. The Brussels stouts and the Randy Jackson was the best but nothing I would go back for.  Out of all of the small plates, I was mostly disappointed by the duck fries. The fries were bland and almost undercooked. The chicken and waffles was fair but for $14.00 I expected a larger portion or more flavor.   I hope you have a better experience than my party for almost $100.00 :("}
{"text":"Check it out between 5pm - 7pm for happy hour, they have some great deals and the food was fabulous. I would recommend their duck fat french fries and hummus. The bread that they serve with the hummus was fantastic, it was warmed and oiled lightly. The hummus had roasted chickpeas mixed in, grilled lemon, and was spot on. The potions were good sized and we ended up having enough that we didn't need any dinner later. The cocktails can get very pricy here (15++) but again they had some great craft cocktails for $9 during happy hour so split some appetizers and take advantage of the deals. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food here was really good, but super pricy. I really liked the tuna tare tar the best. It was so flavorful and tasted perfect with the crispy potato chips. We got free pickles with a check in with yelp. It was good, but super salty, so you have to eat it was other things in your meal the balance out the saltiness. The portions were small, so we had to order a lot of food and it was so pricy.  I felt like our server was awkward and forcing us to order things off the menu that we didn't really want. I probably would try other places when I am in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Braised short rib, eggs & bacon, calamari, quinoa, and other things. I ate a month ago so I forgot. I just remember the food was legit. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Wow, what did I miss that the other reviewers found so exciting about Searsucker?  Though I've never been to Searsucker in San Diego, I only assumed that the San Diego location must be well established in order to open a Scottsdale location and a  transition into Scottsdale would not be hindered with \"working out the kinks\".  The restaurant is cold - not in style but in air conditioning.  It seems that the temperature cannot be regulated and it's either on or off.  The food was okay, enjoyable but nothing special.  My friends ordered flatiron steak and really enjoyed them.  I had a short rib that was pretty good, though it was served lukewarm.  Another friend ordered tartare, which she returned due to excessive salt.   Service was slow despite being a Sunday night with a smaller dining crowd.  Overall we were disappointed by the slow service, cold temperature of the restaurant and the expense of the food - very expensive for service and quality of food.  We all thought the red velvet cake was completely tasteless and the chocolate mousse on a brownie nothing more than pudding on a stale brownie.  Maybe I'll visit again in a few months to see if I feel differently."}
{"text":"I decided to dine here before seeing Celine Dion (which was canceled that day because she got sick). The menu looked pretty enticing online and I was eager to try a few dishes.   Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. I felt the food was mediocre and overpriced.   I went with small plates so I could sample different things:  Pig ears - I was so excited to see pig ears on the menu. Growing up in Taiwan, pig ears is a common dish where they marinade with Chinese five spice and make it crunchy but not rubbery. I haven't had pig ears for couple of decades so I was looking forward to this dish. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected. The ears were chewy/rubbery and way too salty. I guess if you are drinking beer, this would be good beer bar food. It's not very good on its own.   Calamari steak with chili honey glaze - The server recommended it to me. While the portion is decent and the meat cooked right, the flavor isn't impressive. Maybe it's because I grew up in Taiwan so I'm so used to the sauces that it's nothing new to me. They basically flash fried the calamari steak and the tossed them in some Chinese spicy and sweet sauce that you can buy at 99 Ranch store and call it the day.   Duck fat fries - Tasted just like regular fries. Nothing special.   I was quite disappointed with this experience. If you aren't used to Asian flavors, you might enjoy this place. Otherwise, skip it."}
{"text":"Excellent place to meet up with friends.  I really loved their scallops and chicken entree. The steak was ok.  They make excellent cocktails and I highly recommend going for their happy hour.  Price point is about average..just like anywhere else on the strip."}
{"text":"I was traveling for work and some of my coworkers wanted to find some place nearby for happy hour. They had some really good looking dishes on happy hour but the really selling point was the price! Drinks $5-8 and apps for $9 is pretty much unheard of in Las Vegas, especially on the strip. We each got a drink, nothing special. For apps my favorite was the duck fat prosciutto dusted fries. They were perfectly crispy, probably twice fried. We also got the tomato burrata which was delicious but didn't really fit the theme of the other food. We also got there sliders (opted for lettuce wrapped) and the seasoning of the meat was very good. There was cheddar and bacon mixed into the meat itself which you could tell it really enhanced the flavor. My coworker got the tuna tacos, which were in wonton wrappers. There was a pretty large about of tuna but she said they weren't seasoned very well. All around, I would go back for happy hour by stick to the sliders and fries."}
{"text":"Made reservations about a week ago.....received confirmation emails last week and a reminder today.....showed up for my wife's birthday only to find a CLOSED sign on the door.....thanks Searsucker for not even sending us an email or giving a call!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a recent trip to Vegas for a quick happy hour tide-over before our late dinner reservations. We went right when they were supposed to open at 5, and we were basically told they weren't ready to open. So we waited for a bit until they were. Then we were seated in the bar area. It took quite some time for a server to approach us, and when she did, she wasn't exactly bursting with excitement about her job. I ordered the sliders and partner ordered some sort of taco thing. Both were okay, but nothing we would have raved about given the other high end options we visited while we were in town. As others have mentioned, it's dark and loud, so while it was fine when we first got there, but about 6 p.m. it was crowded and overbearing. In all, I probably would have gone with 3 on the food and drink alone (and the happy hour deals were nice), but the service was poor enough that I took it down one star."}
{"text":"Had a great time, for new Resturant it was great. We loved the smalls, next time we all agreed to order two courses of these. The house red was so good- we ordered a bottle, very good. Only a few areas of focus, one main was over salted, and for some reason the bar staff could not make a very dirty, very dry martini!!! But all things considered great new Resturant. We will be back"}
{"text":"I recently held a work event here and I cannot tell you how amazing the night was! The catering director was amazing to work with and made all the details easy, the staff was fabulous, and the food and drinks were just outstanding. I would highly recommend dinner or an event at Searsucker."}
{"text":"I love the searsucker in San Diego so my friends and I just had to check out the Las Vegas one. It's pretty different but the experience/ambiance was just as good. I like how the lighting was dim. We sat at the bar for happy hour and each got a specialty cocktail that was so so...but once we started talking to the bartenders they steered us in the right direction. I would recommend changing the cocktail list on happy hour because the couple sitting next to us weren't very impressed either. We had so much fun with the two bartenders. Phill(?) and the blonde girl were so funny! it started our night off right. The girl told us about the wings, peppers and that tomato bruschetta type dish was a must have and she was right. So yummy! She explained how the wings and peppers were prepared because personally, I've never heard of them before and I'm glad I tried something new."}
{"text":"Located in ceasars. We had made ressies and were promptly seated. Ambiance is beautiful - lots of wood and ropes channeling a very natural and warm space. I got a drink that was lychee and sake based and it was just ok. Normally those are my favorite type of drinks. We got the tuna poke as a starter and that was 5 stars!!!! The tuna was deliciously seasoned and loaded on a very delicate crisp seaweed chip. I could've eaten 10 more of those. For dinner we settled on the 2 lb lobster meal for two along with potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The lobster came out quickly and was perfectly grilled with a side of butter of course. My only complain is this meal will likely leave most people hungry. Most of the meat is in the tail which wasn't much and there's some in the claw. Thank god it came with sides. Both Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were good. For dessert we tried the bread pudding which came loaded with lit s'mores. Cool concept but the timing is pretty important here and the s'mores were very burned by the time the dish arrived at our table. It looked pretty carcinogenic so we didn't really touch it and the bread pudding was just ok. The dessert menu was pretty limited and the other 3 options were all cold. Would've liked to see a chocolate cake or something. Overall great experience. Apps and entrees seem solid. Cocktails and dessert are more of a hit or miss."}
{"text":"The food was good, my party of 4 had 3 really good dishes. My dish, a chicken with a poached egg was okay.  It was missing something like a thicker sauce ( perhaps a simple wine, cream and morel sauce). However; my hubby's Mahi Mani was Delish! Right amount of sauce, some type of fruit or currant(I don't recall) but great! The Pork Butt, OMG,so good and cooked perfectly. It was a whole meal, there were a few pieces of greens on the plate. My daughter, a 14 year old princess had the $40.00 filet, and she would not give me any! She is a steak conisure and she orders medium and she said it was cooked perfectly. I think she has a picture I will upload. The only downside,it was a lacarte, we didn't eat the sides much, the water at $9, was overpriced so we spent way too much. I think the prices are a little steep but if you hVe the money...go and enjoy!  I almost forgot...the service is great! The Server was really knowledgeble and they are quick to refill and take dirty plates away. Service was top notch!"}
{"text":"We had all shared plates. Delicious food made uniquely; octopus, calamari, chicken wings. Service was very helpful and took care of us without interruption. Not the best view nor atmosphere but once the food came it didn't matter. They were also quick to get out the first plates. I would go back again to try other plates and enjoy again some of the previous ones."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  The calimari was not that great smothered in sweet sauce. And fries too much seasoning. The burger was good but not great. Their house wine sweet ;/ but great ambiance and staff. And convenient if in Caesars."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner, just the boyfriend and I. We shared two tapa like plates (short ribs and spicy shrimp with grits) both very delicious especially the shrimp and grits and we also shared a main plate (tuna wrapped in prosciutto) this was ok kind of bland tasting. The service was excellent and they brought out our ordered dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday to me...the cocktail I also got was delicious, definitely had a kick... jalaberry strawpeno!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night without knowing much about it. It was a lot better than I expected. The food and service was very good and even the decor was pleasantly nice. The calamari was delicious for an appetizer but if you want my advice, if you go, make sure you get the braised pork. You'll thank me later. It was done to complete perfection."}
{"text":"My friends and I bought tickets to attend the #VegasStrong benefit show at Omnia, and Oliver at the Hakkasan concierge group reached out to me with a dinner deal at Searsucker. $55 a person for either the prix fixe menu, or spend $55 on the a la carte menu. The entrees are around $30ish, so if you get a cocktail and an appetizer or dessert you're pretty much set. The bonus was a bottle of wine for each four people, and expedited entry into Omnia, which is a huge plus because the lines can get pretty crazy.  I don't remember our server's name, but he handled our party of 12 really well. We opted to do family style sharing plates, so he basically just ordered the menu highlights for us and made it work out to $55 a person. I think we probably would've gotten more food if we would have ordered on our own, but I'm much more of a tapas girl so small portions and bigger variety are right up my alley. They were super nice and even brought out different plates for my gluten-intolerant friend. I lost count, but we probably had about a dozen dishes in all.   Highlights were the burrata, scallops and the skirt steak. The beer marinade on the drunken skirt steak is amazing. The calamari was also really good - strip cut instead of rings and tentacles - super tender, with a yummy chili honey glaze. I'm a huge fan of short ribs and had high expectations for theirs, but it wasn't as \"fall apart\" as some other ones I've had. We also had hummus, poke, wings, heirloom carrots, brussels, and the brick chicken - everything was good, just nothing super special. I also had a smoked old fashioned, which was really well done. I wish I would have stirred it first though, because I had a sip that was all smoked maple syrup and almost dropped my glass. But once everything was mixed together the flavors were amazing! We skipped dessert because we had to head into Omnia for the show, but I could've easily put down an ice cream sandwich.   Ambiance wise, the restaurant was packed, not a ton of room between tables. EDM music is blasting; I assume because of their partnership with Omnia. Luckily for me that's right up my alley, but it's loud enough that I couldn't hear my friend two seats away. If you're going for dinner and convo, this probably isn't the place for you. But overall, I think it's a decently priced place on the strip with good food, and a great place to grab drinks and small bites before a night out."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a date night at Searsucker this past weekend and it was awesome!   I had visited one time before for an event, but this was my first \"sit down\" meal at the restaurant. We had a 9:00 reservation and were seated right away at arrival.   The dining room is modern and unique, with a nice bar, some loungy couch seating beside some wingback chairs and coffee tables, and a typical dining area. The chairs are mismatched which would usually drive me nuts but worked in the space. The chandeliers are rope-y (presumably as a nod to the Southwest) The music was loud when we arrived but chilled out a bit once the DJ started at 10 - this surprised me! The crowd was pretty eclectic, running the gamut from a group of bachelorettes (Who couldn't seem to stay seated at their table) to a dinner party of septegenarians in expensive pantsuits.   Our server stopped by pretty promptly to take our drink order, and a runner brought our drinks to the table shortly thereafter - he set them down along with an order of their Cheese Puffers (they reminded me a bit of the Cheesy biscuits at Red Lobster, which might seem like a backhanded compliment but seriously, those are the only things that can get me into a Red Lobster, and they a freaking addictive, so it is actually high praise)   Then... we didn't see our server for awhile. Like, at all. Nowhere to be seen in the whole dining room. It got to a point where I began to get anxious when Matteo, a floor manager, popped by the table to check in and make sure that everything was good. I briefly mentioned that we were just waiting for our server to come to take our order and he immediately apologized and offered to go ahead and take the order from us. He was kind and hospitable and got us completely taken care of - I mentioned that we planned to order several appetizers \"tapas style\" and he handled that with aplomb, suggesting that since our table was so small, he would course out the items to leave us enough space to dine. This was a perfect solution and was greatly appreciated.   We ordered a variety of items: Steak Tartare with Taro Chips and Quail Egg - YUM! Super flavorful and a perfect portion size. It was a bit on the salty side, but I think that this just enhanced the beef instead of overpowering it.  Bacon + Eggs - Pork Belly, toast, and a perfectly poached egg... this was really good! I love me some breakfast for dinner, so this was my kind of dish.  Farmbird Meatballs with Snake Bite Sauce and Blue Cheese Fondue - I had these on my first visit and they're what brought me back - amazing! Their version of Buffalo chicken, the combination of flavors is just perfect. The sauce on the meatballs definitely has a kick which is perfectly neutralized by the blue cheese fondue. The portion is nice - 5 good sized meatballs. Tons of flavor - absolutely recommend these. Chicken + Waffle - yet more breakfast for dinner, just my style! Nice combo of salty/sweet. The chicken was moist, the waffle was tasty.   Dessert - We shared the King sundae, which included peanutbutter cup icecream, bacon caramel, whipped cream, and bruleed bananas. Hubby was in seventh heaven.   The service during the remainder of our meal was perfectly timed - the runner who took care of our drinks was well spoken and attentive and our server checked in with us a few times to be sure all was good.   I've been looking forward to Searsucker for awhile and after this experience, I really can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I popped in here because the hubs was playing Texas Hold 'Em.  I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine, did my Yelp check in, and poof, up pops an offer for a complimentary habanero and coriander pickle.  Never to turn something spicy down, I asked for it.  Well, shut it...that damn pickle rocked my world.  Spicy brine, nice heat, and um, hello, it's a pickle.  What is not to love about pickles?  Nice wines BTG.  Cool menu, creative flavors."}
{"text":"This place was so good. We came in on a Sunday and they had football playing on the TVs. Their menu was small and appeared to have only football snack foods. We ordered anyway. We ordered the buffalo wings and fried chicken and eggs. The food was sooooooo good. All of it. I think my fiancé got the biscuits, also delicious.   The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because they were training the bar back to make drinks. Well, they said they were training him but every time he got a ticket for drinks he would let it sit there and wait until a waiter or a bartender would come by for them to make it. (I know this because I sat in view of the bar).   Waited too long for our drinks. When you're in Vegas that's the last thing you want. Disappointed in the training and in the barback."}
{"text":"I was waiting for my parents while they were gambling in the casino. I sat at the bar and tried to get the attention and service from a tall woman/young lady bartender. She had a Raiders t-shirt on so I asked her if she was from the Bay Area or if she was a fan. She replied with a no, then mentioned to me that she was from LA, then walked away. I had to wait for another employee to ask me if I would like to place an order for food and drink. I was treated and welcomed nicely by a gentleman bartender and sat by very friendly patrons. If management is reading this, I would offer her your love until  she learns to love herself. I will pray for her. God Bless."}
{"text":"came here for a private cocktail event. great atmosphere. It is right next to Omnia so it was the perfect place to go before hitting the club. the cocktail was amazing and the hors d'oeuvres were great. tried its crab-cake, sliders, lollipop wings, and tomato & burrata. I find the lollipop wings to be on the salty side but everything else was great! slider is extremely delicious. i would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. It isn't often that I feel compelled to write a 5-star review, but this place demands it. Hubby and I had the most wonderful meal here. First of all our server, Charles, was hilarious and engaging. This place labels itself as \"a social dining experience\" (hey, it's on the receipt like that) and I think they mean because from the moment you walk in, they try to get to know you. The hostess asked us a few questions, and clearly passed that onto our server before he came over to our table, because he was prepped with the info. He started off with a little joke of singing something, which my husband and I quickly joined in on, so we immediately started off on the right foot. Dinner consisted of all small plates. We got the duck fat fries, mushroom burrata toast, egg & pork belly, and short ribs. The fries are tied for first place as the best fries I've ever had. They were perfectly light and crispy, without being dry. The mushroom & burrata toast was incredible with such flavorful, rich mushrooms. The pork belly is essentially grown up eggs Benedict on broiche toast with Hollandaise. It was good, but sadly not warm when we finally got around to eating it (we ordered too much food!) and the short rib, while tender, was not terribly exciting in the flavor department (think pot roast) but still well cooked and falling-apart tender. After seeing a bunch of desserts pass by the table, hubby and I had some room left in our tummies from just sticking to small plates, so we ordered three, yes three, desserts. The desserts are awesome here. The apple crostata was a lovely rustic pie crust purse filled with caramelized apples. After the warm apples, we went the other direction and got something cold with the Ermagerd Sundae. The peanut butter gelato in this sundae is heavenly. It had such rich peanut butter flavor without being too heavy or losing it's creaminess. We had them bring one dessert at a time so we could digest enough to press on. After all this, we still had another dessert on the way. The finale was the S'more bar. The honey flavor in the graham cracker crust was very robust and I had tasted that wonderful honey in a couple of other dishes. I would love to know what kind of honey they use, it's a good one. The chocolate on top of the crust is a very heavy bodied, rich chocolate mousse, topped with whipped marshmallow topping that is torched. It was all delicious. Our server was great throughout the whole meal and we enjoyed him a lot. The meal was excellent all around and I will definitely come back here each time I go to Vegas. Do not miss the desserts here."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Becareful, they will try very hard to upsell you big time, esp with water!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night after we learned about the Omnia Nightclub deal. Basically, each person in your party must spend $50 and you will receive a \"chip\" that will allow you complimentary expedite meaning, you do not have to wait in line. Now you definitely need to pay to get inside the club, so this chip only lets you come in front of the line. Try and get on a guestlist by looking up on IG etc, then you may get lucky and receive complimentary entry as well. (We wanted to go see Zedd, so we used this chip and got on a guest list that gave us free admission until 1am; arrived around 11:45 and the club was already packed!!!!)  Anyhow, for the food, we had the tuna tacos and octopus for appetizer. Honestly, I expected more but it was very mediocre, not especially tasty or flavorful. For our entrée, we ordered the lobster which was AMAZING. The lobster came with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts that paired well with the lobster.  Would I recommend this restaurant? Probably not, but if you are trying to get into Omnia yes, I think it is a great deal."}
{"text":"We tried Searsucker fourth of July weekend and really honestly wanted to like it. We did our research and we were excited to try several of the menu items. We were \"greeted\" by the two completely unenthusiastic hostesses and taken to our table. Our server Tammie was knowledgeable when it came to menu and drink suggestions. My husband wasn't thrilled with his unbalanced rather sweet \"signature\" old fashioned. But being in Vegas we were both still looking forward to enjoying our dinner.    We were seated in the open kitchen area, which we love! and were shocked to watch the chef touch every raw garnish of every plate of food and then wipe his hands on his apron-less pants, face and phone. Not appetizing in the least. We then watched the manager (at least that's who think was the manager) touch every bit of face, eyes, nose, lips and then proceeded to touch the raw garnish on a dish before sending it along with a food runner. Obviously once we saw a few of these incidents we began to notice even more of them. Kind of like a train wreck- you just can't look away!   My husband and I both work in the industry and are sensitive to some of these issues.  We are never THAT table (unhappy without merit or reason) but we found ourselves being irritated with the compounding service issues. Everyone was on their phones almost the entire time! And I don't say/write this lightly.  The chef, the \"manager\" and a woman who we assumed was an assistant manager were on their phones for significant periods of time, constantly texting. I get it, we all have lives and communicate constantly but step off of the floor and send your quick text but to stand out openly in the dining room for 5 plus minutes on your phone makes no sense and is unacceptable.  The \"assistant manager\", a younger woman, did not put her phone down once, seriously not once the entire evening. We were laughing about it by the end of the night, that's something that we have never seen before.  Neither the food nor the signature cocktails were a saving grace unfortunately.  We tried a few appetizers wanting to get a good idea of the concept and the Chef.  We started with a couple of the \"jar\" dishes, the first was the crab, very one note.  The crab was hammered by Sriracha mayo and gargantuan pieces of Avocado.  Next the tomato and burrata jar, was perhaps the \"best\" appetizer we had, but the burrata itself was begging and pleading for salt, which is not offered on the tables, lol!   We also ordered the bone marrow and pork belly both of which were incredibly sweet.  We didn't even touch the third bone because the sweetness was overwhelming which honestly is saying something because we are both huge marrow fans.  The only thing we remember about the pork belly was how sweet it was.    Lastly we ordered a grass fed NY steak with two sides.  We ordered the strip medium rare, it came out BLUE, completely cold in the middle.  As we took 5 minutes contemplating sending the steak back we realized we were also missing one of our sides.    We NEVER send things back to the kitchen but were at this point rather frustrated and wanted to at least finish our meal and get out of there. The steak was returned to us warmed through a healthy rare but at least edible.  When the corn finally arrived it was by far the best thing we ate that night.  It had a nice balance of smoky, spicy and creamy. The cauliflower was good at first but quickly became rather one vinegary note.   As a last note, while the manager and Chef were steps away from us the entire 2 plus hours we were having dinner, neither of them bothered to acknowledge, greet, check-in, chat, smile, or honestly look at us.  Why even have an open kitchen if you aren't invested in engaging the dining room????   This was the LEAST expensive dinner we ate on our trip and the MOST disappointing by far. IMO service was awful, food was mediocre.  All in all we left feeling frustrated that we wasted an evening of our trip at Searsucker, what a bummer!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and food is good. We ordered many of their small plates to share: calamari steaks, octopus, hamachi, duck fat fries, brussels, cauliflower and bone marrow. Everything was OK, there was nothing I ate that I would say was exceptional. However, everything did \"look\" pretty tasty and while it did taste good, again, nothing special.  We ordered the grilled cheese, a couple salads, the tuna tacos and some sliders. I would say the grilled cheese was the best of all these selections. Nice presentation and really tasty as well.  My one gripe about our experience was our waitress, she seems so over it before our wine even came out. It was a bummer because I truly believe the experience is a huge part of eating out (at least for me). She was dry and emotionless and seemed annoyed overall, which put a damper on our experience, unfortunately. Also, the place was pretty empty, which was weird for a Saturday night in Vegas at 9 pm.   I think I prefer Herringbone Las Vegas...but probably wouldn't turn down coming here again, the food was decent enough to try again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite experiences. A friend invited me and I got there late and everything was almost completely devoured. What was left and that I was able to eat was incredible.  Woooow. Will visit again."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it was more amazing than we what we heard. Servers were upbeat and wonderful. Desiree was awesome and had great knowledge of the menu. Definitely coming back for more. Ermahgurd!!"}
{"text":"This place is located right next door to Omnia. We came here for dinner with plans to go to the nightclub afterwards. The food was surprisingly delicious! We ordered a bunch of different items to share amongst our group, and a whole lot of cocktails to get the party started early. I tried my friend's \"Fizzy Lifter\" cocktail and it was light, fruity and yummy! I would recommend that for any girls who like fruity drinks. My favorite item out of everything we ordered was the spicy hamachi and avocado! I don't usually do spicy food, but this dish was very tolerable. The guys also got the 36 oz ribeye tomahawk. Let me tell you--that thing is massive!!! They couldn't even finish it. Overall it was a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is ok, nothing to die for. They have limited wine by the glass and I had the caramel scallop...1 scallop. It was good, but the rest of the menu is overrated.  If you like eclectic food that's all show, less on taste/substance, this may be spot for you.    The positive was the cheese bread they start you off with.  That was best thing.  Oh, and the service was good, they brought a free desert for my sister's birthday which was nice."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review - Skip the humous, order the sliders, duck fat fries or bruschetta.  Don't order the martini with the honey and blue, way too sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, delicious food and a great atmosphere is the perfect combination for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience.  We tried this place because we liked the menu online and live in SoCal and with the options near home it was a good way to try some yummy food that we may also be able to try when home.  We will be trying the restaurants near home for sure too.    The service was solid but we also were there during Happy Hour so it was a slight slow at times but over all very solid.  We went during Happy Hour and got a collection to share at the table to try several different options.  Hummus - very flavorful and the bread was delicious alone but the hummus added to It.  Potato fries - anything fried in duck fat is going to be amazing and this did not disappoint.  The prosciutto dust added to the flavor.  Slider - perfectly cooked and had a nice spicy to them.  Tuna taco - fresh and flavorful"}
{"text":"Cocktails and food were delicious, great atmosphere.  I would give it a 5 but my steak came out well done instead of medium rare the first time but they corrected it with grace.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour before a show.  Nice atmosphere and decor.  Hummus was excellent and the pita bread was housemade.  Tuna tacos were also very good."}
{"text":"Just okay. Service was pretty annoying. Either they wouldn't leave us alone so we could finish certain items, or we had to ask for every little thing. They bugged us constantly as we ate, then literally disappeared for 15 minutes after we finished. I cannot stand bad service when I'm paying at a high price point.   Best part - Short ribs with horse radish mash. So so good. Worst part - over cooked New York that the waiter held in 'better light' over my friend's head to show us that it was 'what we ordered.' So unprofessional and quite rude. My husband is much more forgiving and just ate it since the waiter argued with us about the degree of cooking. We were sharing so I actually didn't eat any steak. Thankfully my friends shared the short rib with me.   Pear goat cheese salad was good. Kale Ceasar was good. Mac and cheese was good. Butter potatoes were good. All was just good. Vegas, Ceasars Palace, Saturday nights....I want great for the amount of money we are paying.   I won't be back. Not with 100 other options in a 1 mile radius."}
{"text":"Being the good wife that I am, I took my husband out for dinner at Searsucker.  Having dined here before I knew he would enjoy their tasty dishes.    I originally just wanted to stop in for happy hour but since they had an event going on in the bar area, we stepped in for a full dining experience.  Service was great! Before we met our waiter, another waiter stopped over for drink orders.  He noticed ours was busy with another table and didn't want us to go unnoticed.  Very thoughtful and attentive! During the rest of our meal service was nothing less than excellent.  He was professional and courteous.   We started with the lollipop buffalo wings with the blue cheese fondue.  Well it isn't really fondue so much as it is just a small cup blue cheese dressing.  But the wings are good.  The meat came right off the bone so easily.  Tasty starter for sure.    The delicious meals we ordered were wonderful! I enjoyed the beer braised short ribs served over horseradish potatoes topped with two onion rings.  So tender, flavorful and mouthwatering.  I should have stopped at eating half but it was just too good to stop.    My husband ordered the filet medium rare as usual.  His belief is that a steak should not need any sauce to be good.  Well they nailed it here.  The perfectly cooked steak was before him.  There wasn't any doubt it was good since he cleaned the plate.    Chef Malarkey has done a fine job with Searsucker.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had.  How can you go wrong? Beef burger with pork belly, cooked to perfection with gruyere cheese, caramelized onion and baconaise all nestled between a butter bun.  Soooo good!  My friend had the Drunk chicken crust sandwhich that was equally as delicious.  Can't wait to go back for dinner with my hubby!"}
{"text":"We were on the Strip at Caesars for a show and wanted to grab a light dinner afterwards. Seersucker had decent yelp reviews and was very close to the theater so we thought we would give it a try. Almost immediately after we sat down, Tyler, Our server came by to greet us, get our drink orders, and explain the menu. Immediately made us feel very welcome. Because we were not terribly hungry we decided we would go for three small plates and their corn bread muffins. For the small plates we got the calamari, the octopus, and the short ribs. Tyler told us that the calamari is one of their house specialties. He did not lie. They were quite good. The octopus is grilled. It was tasty. But nothing really special. The short ribs with mashed potatoes were short ribs with mashed potatoes, also nothing really special. The cornbread muffins with the specialty butter actually the highlight of the evening. Quite tasty for only five dollars, If you consider a restaurant charging for 7 really small muffins to be OK. So if the calamari was quite good, and the cornbread muffins were also good, and the service was excellent, why only three stars. You have to take into account value. Each of the small plates dishes were $18. I thought this was a little on the high side even for the strip. In addition, they nail you put $12 in parking.So when you figure 3 small shared plates, no adult beverages, and parking plus tax and tip was $90. Not a great value. Definitely would not go back here and would not recommend"}
{"text":"This place is very lively for happy hour, I recommend stopping by and grabbing a table at the bar. Our happy hour menu did not look like the ones that people posted on here so they may have updated it or they have different menus different nights.  We ordered a bunch of cocktails but really loved the matador and skinny jenny. We also loved the pork chips, fish tacos and sliders. I could have eaten 3 orders of the pork chips, they were wonderful.   The only things we didn't love were the chicken wings and the shishito peppers, they were both fine just not what we were expecting."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour, the drinks were priced ok for Vegas $5-9.  The food was good, I guess we expected more from a top chef restaurant.  The biggest issue that we had was we had asked for the avocado on the side of our ahi tuna tacos because I am allergic to avocado but my wife isn't.  The bartender that took our order explained it was already on the side.  After my first bite into the taco I realized it was on the bottom of the taco as well.  Very disappointing. We also order the lollipop wings which were $9 on happy hour.  They had good flavor, but I don't think they were anything special."}
{"text":"Date - June 15, 2015  After have a decent, but not great, dinner at Hakassan we cabbed back to Caesars (our home base) for dessert at Searsucker. The place was fairly crowded but we got seated right away.  The decor is interesting and the ambiance is extremely loud - there is no intimacy and conversation is very difficult.  Our waitress seemed overwhelmed - everything was very slow. At one point she came to check on us well after we had ordered and said, \"How is everything? Oh, I see you don't have your desserts yet.\" That pretty much sums up the experience.  The desserts were OK  ... we had two orders of the warm apple crostata (it wasn't very warm) and one order of cookies and milk. We ended up taking two of the cookies with us and they were thrown away the next day.  I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Good food but pricey. I enjoyed our meal, the Yelp check in offer is SPICY but delicious, would purchase next time I go, so good business tactic there. I wouldn't mind trying more food on the menu, we came late at night and sat down close to closing time, but nobody seemed to care and we got good service, but we didn't do the usual appetizer, drink, entree approach; however, the food we did have was tasty and good portions. You might feel out of place in shorts and a tshirt, so go to your room and change if you were just at the pool or something."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced but good!  The staff was great.  I had the short ribs.  The horseradish mash wasn't spicy at all and the habenero pickles just tasted like sweet pickles. The grilled cheese was very tasty and the fries were crisp and delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here during happy hour and sampled just about everything. The service was absolutely excellent. Our server sent over a complimentary appetizer as well as comped our dessert as it was my birthday. The food quality, portions and prices are all great for being right on the strip. There was also a great beer menu. Also a bonus, the owner (prior Top Chef contestant) was in the restaurant the day we dined there. We would definitely go back and would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"At Laurie's birthday 11/20/2015..9:33pm. Party of 14. My New York Steak - worse than gross. Denny's is like Mortons compared to this. I ordered medium. Barely ran past the fire. Lobster Mac n Cheese disgusting. Bearded Waiter - convinced this stuff was going to be good... Maybe it is sometimes. People at our table really liked the bone marrow dish.  Crab cake was good. Calamari was very good."}
{"text":"So was very excited to try this place but it fell flat. The cocktails served were just ok, the game has been uped so much in Vegas on this front that these served were just boring and lacked any craftsmanship on prepration, service or presentation.   The food was good, not amazing, not phenomenal, it was good.   The bartender server was not engaging, didn't introduce self and staff on our way out failed to thank or say bye. I asked what their infused liquors were and instead of telling me their offerings she (the bartender) gave me the definition of infusion... sigh."}
{"text":"Excellent drinks and service! Make sure to say \"Hi\" to Adrian at the Bar, awesome bartender!"}
{"text":"Good service, food was great. Presentation was wonderful, small portions for the cost but overall good. Hit up the happy hour for the best value!"}
{"text":"We went for a friends bday party and after reading a few other reviews, I agree.  One, the plating was prety.  Two, some bites were really good and some were like \"WHAT!\"  Everything we tried ie: pickles, bone marrow, fingerling potatoes, cauliflower, shark, filet, and pork had good bites, and had bad.  for instance.  My shark had crab meat on top, couldnt tell if it was fresh or from a can.  It was so super salty it literally felt like I was a horse... if that make sense, licking a salt lick.  I ate around it and the outside of the shark was super salty too!  Like literally salty!!!!   i even told the manager he was like... oh im sorry... i had to ask for some lime to tame the salt.  I shoulve asked for a shot of tequila too.  Either way, drinks were amazing, and the steak was nicely done.  The server wasn't that on top of it, the horsd'oevre  came before the drinks :/  and it wasnt even busy.  anyways.  it was all right."}
{"text":"Malarkey's Duck Fat Fries are the best way to celebrate National French Fry Day. As always there is no better fry than a duck fat fry and these guys make some good ketchup too. Had the flank steak and jalapeno chorizo corn. Delicious. Simply, delicious."}
{"text":"I've read and heard mixed reviews about Searsucker Scottsdale so I decided to go check it out for myself.  I went with a friend in town so I was a bit nervous to explore unchartered territory. I can understand the mixed reviews.   Great atmosphere. NIce for romance or groups. We ponied up at the bar and had great service.    I ordered a handcrafted cocktail that was a special and not on the menu. It was DELISH!   Decided to order a few appetizers instead of entrees:   Shishito peppers = standard but delicious   Pork Belly + Egg on Brioche = tender and decadent. Great flavors.   Chicken + Waffles = Surprising preparation. Ask your server. VERY good!  Kobe Carpaccio = Meh! I enjoyed the razor thin slices. But the flavor was bland and the hearts of palm slaw in the middle ruined the entire dish.   I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is solid, and HH has some pretty good deals... but the service is terrrrrible- hit up HH 4:30-6PM for food and drinks at half price or less, but show up half an hour before you want anyone acknowledge you. No exaggeration. Oh, and then double check your receipt to be sure you were actually charged HH price instead of regular.   DUCK FAT FRIES + TOMATO JAM: All of my LA friends raved about duck fat fries like four years ago and I never tried them. These are some damn near perfect fries, but I was expecting some sort of distinct \"duck fat\" flavor and didn't really pick up on one. The tomato jam seems to just be a house-made ketchup with a bit of spice to it. STRAWBERRY + CHAMPAGNE + WALNUT + GOAT: It's a salad, fresh for summer. Instead of goat cheese crumbles or large circles, the cheese is served as a \"fondue\" on the plate. I found the sauce a little light on flavor and missed the texture it usually brings to a salad. \"COBB\" SALAD: Good portion, $6 for HH. Very fresh, lots of ingredients, cut to the proper size, and something I would get again even though it's far from a unique dish. TUNA + RADISH + TARO CHIPS + SPICE: The taro chips are huge and provide great texture. The poke itself was spicier than I expected but was exceptionally fresh. Not sure I'd get this again though.  EGGS + BACON \"PORK BELLY\": Cue the hallelujah choir! Perfectly poached egg, generous and thick cut of pork belly, drizzled with a delightful hollandaise with a slight sweetness to it, all atop a thin slice of toast. I'll wake up early every day if this is for breakfast! CRAB CAKE JUMBO LUMP + FENNEL + LEMON VERBENA AIOLI: Slightly salty but otherwise great! Made with very little filler, allowing the simple ingredients to shine. Server said this also had a Tabasco tobiko that I really enjoyed. Pretty pricey though at $17 regularly, a steal at $10 during HH. SHORT RIB \"HARLOT\" + HORSERADISH + FRIED ONION: It looked dry and didn't have much sauce, but was very tender and shredded easily. The fried onions and butter potatoes were simple but perfectly executed.  SWEET HEAT SQUID: Calamari in a sweet and sour sauce, with julienned apples. Fresh, good variety of textures, generous portion for HH. BF really enjoyed this. SHRIMP GRITS: Not a great version. Several shrimp, bland sauce, overcooked grits. This was a bit saucier than I liked and needed seasoning. Would not get this again, it's on the HH menu and I think it's priced appropriately there. MUSSELS: The broth was missing something, but was nicely fragrant with a large portion. The accompanying garlic bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Would get this again.  The food is pretty decent. Bar staff are friendly, but I have twice been assigned to a server who waited nearly a half hour to show up at my table, and nearly as long to bring the check. Given my two dismal service experiences during HH, it's not a place I'm willing to return for a full meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Could not go wrong with whatever you end up choosing. Calamari steak was excellent!! That was probably my favorite of all the dishes we tried.   Calamari Steak 10/5 Lollipop wings 5/5 Fish & chips 5/5 - presentation is gorgeous! Spaghetti Squash Scampi 5/5 Short ribs 5/5 - super tender!! Pork belly 4/5 - I'm biased though cause I'm not a big pork fan.  Ice Cream Sammies   Cookies & milk   I gotta go back for happy hour one day!"}
{"text":"What a great joint!  Awesome service too.  Seems like the menu has changed.  This is what was there tonight.  Starters: Potato Fries - unreal.  Crunchy and delicious.   Lollipop wings very tasty.  There was a crab and avocado dip with crusted covered chips - unreal.  Few beers on tap.  Good selection.  Specialty cocktails we had: Achilles Peel and the Indian Summer - both delish, but I thought Achilles was stronger!!  (and no complaint on that) ;) ;)  Dinner: The fish & chips is the BEST I've ever had.  Hands down. One diner had the steak and spinach.  Steak was a bit over done but still good and great spinach.  Another diner had the swordfish - was awesome.  Very disappointed on the dessert.  The profiteroles were three teeny tiny puffs and a tablespoon of peanut butter ice cream and gelee squares on the plate.  True profiteroles are BIG puffs with ice cream in the middle.  I get you need to make your artistic mark on your food - but not dessert, people!  Make 'em normal.  Still a great night.  Would recommend and would return."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious, trendy place inside of Caesars. If you're staying at Caesars, definitely check out happy hour!   The food is pretty delicious, and the drinks are very good! We had the duck fat fries (pretty darn good), the short rib with horseradish mash (really good), and the spicy shrimp and grits (sooooo spicy, but delicious).  Plus, the Happy Hour drinks were creative, and strong!   It was a great place to stop for snacks and drinks, but I wouldn't pay the full menu prices for the food we had. Go during happy hour, it's totally worth it.  We got dinner and 3 drinks for $55."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I don't know if I will keep coming back for dinner, but the cocktails are awesome and the food is good.  The head chef is Brian Malarkey who was on Top Chef and is now on The Taste if you are into cooking reality TV :)  Honestly, the ambiance is amazing. Its really a nice place to just hang out have a few drinks and even happy hour is great. The best drink is the peter rabbit . It is pimms, basil, and has a garnish of a carrot which is pretty neat. As far as the food, the cheddar puffs are awesome as is the lamb. It is cooked a little rare, but I liked it. The flavor was awesome.  Check out the happy hour for cheaper drinks and apparently there is a brunch which we are looking forward to trying!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Great casual atmosphere and a variety of food. For appetizers we ordered an avocado/crab dip and calamari that were both amazing! I ordered the tuna, rare, and it was perfect. My favorite part of dinner, the milk and cookies(not on the menu, but you have to order!). The only thing that threw me off was that this restaurant is supposed to work together with Omnia and they are 2 completely different atmospheres. They do not blend well at all. Overall, awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Pricey.  I had the beet salad, which had way too much arugula. No one likes arugula that much.   Good service and the water glasses are cool!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. We had a large group and needed to be out by a certain time. The chef was really great about creating a tapas style meal. The ahi tacos, steak tartar were good. I wouldn't write home about the entrees, steak, chicken, and fish. Those were alright, not great. The Stars were definitely the more appetizer style dishes. I would come back if prompted."}
{"text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the experience here. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave you are VERY well taken care of in all aspects. We were greeted by the manager, Ashley, whom was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu from the food to the cocktails and ALL of her recommendations were WONDERFUL.  A+ to you and all of your staff !!!  Thank You !"}
{"text":"All around, I really liked this new restaurant. And that really is saying something, considering I had some weird food issues causing me to be very picky about ordering the night I visited Searsucker. I must first say that the service was impeccable. Our waitress, despite my many questions and requests to leave ingredients out of my dishes, was personable, helpful, and attentive.   I had a small plate (the meatballs with tomato sauce, basil, parmesan cheese, and polenta) and a side dish (roasted root vegetables and squash, without the farmer's cheese that normally accompanies this item). Both were delicious, albeit rich. The small plates were very generous in size, which I love, because it enables sharing. I also thought that the complementary cheddar and black pepper (?) biscuits were amazingly tasty. My friends raved about the cocktails, and I was impressed when the waitress told us that all of their cocktails have no added sugars or preservatives.  The desserts are especially worthy of mention. Although somewhat pricey at $9 each, they were absolutely wonderful. We had the sundae, which had some sort of bacon brittle, peanut butter cup pieces, ice cream, caramelized bananas, and peanuts. It was so good, I was practically licking the bowl. The combination of textures, plus saltiness combined with sweetness, was perfect. We also had the cinnamon sugar doughnuts with a dark chocolate dipping sauce, which was a HUGE portion and SO yummy. The doughnut holes were steaming hot and just chewy enough. We couldn't finish those suckers, there were so many!  Also, I paid $30 total, including tax and tip (one small plate, one side, two desserts split with 3 other people). I thought that was impressively reasonable for the high quality of the food and the service. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Great place, unique tasty food, wonderful service!!  We will be going back soon"}
{"text":"I am so bummed that I waited so long to go to Searsucker! It was absolutely fabulous. I will admit that my fondness for Top Chef and the adorable Brian Malarkey was the first reason why I wanted to eat at this new Scottsdale restaurant, but the food and ambiance will be why I go back again.  The restaurant is tucked off Camelback road and Fashion Square Mall and has these funky looking animal statues outside. Hey, I guess you gotta do what you can to get people to notice you, right? The staff was very friendly and welcoming to us. There was a DJ in the bar area and many people enjoying happy hour. The dining room was pretty dead, but it is July in Phoenix and that can be expected of many restaurants. The restaurant was very big, much bigger than I anticipated. The ambiance was casual and sexy at the same time.  I started off with a La Primavera cocktail and it was delicious, but not remarkable. My husband ordered a red wine suggested by our server. It was very good. Of course my husband will always Google a wine on his phone if he likes it so he can compare prices. I guess it was overly priced per glass vs what you could get the wine by the bottle in a retail outlet. Oh well, that is Scottsdale. We started off with the Smalls: Pork belly \"bacon\" + 63 degree egg. It was not only gorgeous in presentation, but really tasty! Kinda like breakfast for dinner.  Next up, we split the \"Cobb\" salad. Oh. My. Gosh. I know it is just a salad, but it was amazing. The blue cheese vinaigrette was amazing. The flavors of the toppings were incredible with every bite. I'm crazy about veggie sides, so I almost ordered all of them with dinner so I could take a few bites of each, but we decided to just do 4. They were the bacon grits, the cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and chorizo with \"corn off the cob.\" The sides were ok. Nothing that wowed me. The brussels were overly salty and I couldn't taste any of the flavor of the other veggie sides because there was so much extra stuff involved in them. But I'm glad I tried them and now know. Luckily, my chicken entree was fantastic. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked over a bead of bulgar and sweetbreads (I don't know where the sweetbreads were unless they were mixed in really well with the bulgar,) but they were fantastic. Loved this dish and would order it again. For dessert we split a sundae, I can't remember the name of it, but it was clever. And it was really good. A sweet ending to a great evening.  I can't wait to go back...maybe with a group of friends. It seems like a great place to go for big girls night out."}
{"text":"Searsucker has been a the best overall addition to the Caesars restaurant line-up in years.  In both visits, we have opted for appetizers and sides to sample its cuisine.  Flavors here are extraordinary. Best brussels side of any restaurant anywhere and ive had it everywhere. The corn n chorizo side is also stellar rich in citrus flavor. The sliders we ordered was piping burning hot when we bit into them, rich in flame grilled flavor and a nicer portion than at Spago. Both salads were first rate. Loved the lemony zest of the Caesar without thr garlic overkill and the Pear & walnut salad was taken up a notch with the whipped goat cheese garnish   The Calamari was just ok. Liked the asian twist and apples. Would have liked it better served traditionally cut thin in rings and tentacles.  Friendly service at the bar and s'mores dessert was killer good. One day ill get around to ordering an entree. In the meantime, im hopeful Searsucker becomes a Caesars fixture for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Wasn't horribly impressed. The menu is not cohesive enough to give the kitchen any rythym to service, hence, there are huge swings in quality of the food. The duck fat fries were so ovely seasoned it was obscuring the pancetta and the unctuousness of the duck fat. The chicken was under seasoned and dry, traded that out for a mid rare filet that was totally bloody... but we ate it anyway since the demi glace was plentiful and delicious. It was very loud too, too much of everything to be wonderful at anything. You blew it on this one Brian! Chef Jill"}
{"text":"I was excited upon seeing a lively rustic chic lounge/bar/dining room. Atmosphere and service were great all-around but there was a noticeable gap between appetizers and entrees.  Of the appetizers, the scallop (one) stood out and the tender squid was fantastic. I'd pass on the dry meatballs. The bacon sounded good but I didn't try it; I just heard the crisp from the other end of a large table.   Entrees were meh. Portions were tiny for the price. My filet was overcooked and the meat was tough to cut into. Salmon portion was also laughable and I noticed four differently-sized pieces on four plates. I'm sure they go by weight over shape/size but still, perception trumps reality. The red velvet cake I had was dry and bland. Among the worst I've had for the price.    Halfway through dinner, a live DJ starting spinning house tracks. I don't think it fit the restaurant vibe and average age of patrons. I found it slightly off-putting and made it difficult to hear my dinner party. Another tip: park next door at NM (one minute walk) for free and avoid the valet.   Overall: another \"celebrity\"-chef hype failing to meet expectations. Avoid bedtime texts with dining partners about how hungry y'all still are. Spend the same amount elsewhere for a much more satisfying, and filling, meal."}
{"text":"Pricey Vegas hotel food, however each dish has its own unique character. The waiters and waitresses are all very friendly. Each person came by with a smile. We were served cream-puff looking biscuits after we sat down. They taste exactly like Goldenfish or CheezeIt's even. Not bad, probably wouldnt have ordered those by themselves.   We ordered: Squid w/stripes of apple -  yum!  Pork butt - has a great tasting sauce Short rib -  pass on this, ive had better Shrimp ceviche - eh, i'd also pass on this Duck fat fries -  not bad either, reminds me of truffle fries.   I'd say this place is tapas-style. Everything comes in small portions but decorated so eloquently. I expected more food for the price."}
{"text":"Eric was an amazing server and so helpful. He was amazing at blending the needs of the group with his own recommendations. And his recommendations were spot on- the braised beef was some of the best I've had (and I'm from the Bay Area, home of braised beef). Overall, an amazing experience for is and our bachelorette group of 12.  Also, from the bachelorette party organizers, this place is perfect for flexibility of a large party and also lets you count drinks toward the max (which some places done).   So good!!"}
{"text":"For our last night in Las Vegas, we decided to go to Searsucker. Located in Caesar's Palace, Searsucker is the restaurant by chef Brian Melarkey, who has had stints on Top Chef and the Taste. I didn't realize this until after the fact, I was just excited by the menu.  The vibe is modern chic meats rustic. Reservations are recommended, even during weekdays, which we did. We started with drinks- they have a decent wine list but also have an interesting cocktail list. I decided on the skinny jenny which is basically a moscow mule with lavender and other surprising ingredients. I loved it. It was a light, refreshing, and well made cocktail. For my meal I decided on oysters and mac and cheese (not in the same dish). The oysters were delicious and came with a refreshing pomegranate sauce. The mac and cheese was also quite delicious and very filling. Rich in flavor (and in cheese), it was definitely a tasty dish.   Service was very good throughout our meal. We were never without an empty water glass and our server made good recommendations. Yelp check in gets you a free appetizer of their house made pickles. It is a pricer meal but definitely worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place for our anniversary (14 years).   It started really well. We had 1/2 dozen east coast oysters. They were delicious (although, I'd have preferred them a little colder).   Next we had bone marrow, also delicious. Seriously, it was very good.   For our entrees, Mike had thr scallops, and I had the burger, medium, which is pertinent to this review.   The burger is supposed to be a big deal, they only make 20 a day.   When my burger arrived, I took a bite out of it, raw. Like, not even warm in the middle.   After I found our server, Giana (she seemed put out to be serving us from the beginning), I sent it back.   Then we waited... and waited...  Then I got my burger, which was the exact burger I had sent back. I know this because I could see the bite I took out of it.   Seriously, if I went to McDonald's they would have made me a new burger, you'd expect a celebrity chef (as stated on the menu) to at least have a service standard on par with a fast food joint.   I started eating. And I just got more angry.   It's a burger with relish and avocado. Why would you reheat that? Gross!  And is it even sanitary?    Do you want to have a steak cooked on a grill after some stranger has taken a bite out of it.   I felt bad for the manager though. He tried. He came over and acknowledged the problem.   Offered some short ribs, which is nice, but I hate that.   I'm supposed to eat by myself, while Mike watches, because a fine dining restaurant doesn't know how to cook a burger."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and atmosphere. The cookie for dessert is delicious! Great place to check out with friends"}
{"text":"Great customer service and the short rib plate was delicious. However, the duck fat fries weren't the crunchy consistency I was expecting, in fact they were pretty soggy. The pork slider was okay, but that's it just okay..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate his birthday. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing!  We made a reservation and were seated promptly. After being seated we admired the interesting decor, kind of modern meets rustic. Our server came over and I expressed to him my dairy issue, he then went out of his way to check with the chef to see what could be made dairy free. He then came back a made several recommendations on what to eat. We had the following: Mussels: a generous portion in a white wine sauce, with chunks of chorizo Tongue & cheek: perfectly cooked tender meat, with flavorful pieces of tongue Lobster butter steak: amazing flavor and cooked very well And for dessert they gave my husband a complimentary birthday cupcake which was really good too. I would highly recommend Searsucker, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time last night. At  our table, we had the filet, the shrimp and the pork butt as well as the duck fat fries, the calamari, the tuna wanton tacos and the biscuits. Everything was great, including the sides (buttered potatoes and Brussels sprouts). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Props for barrel aged cocktails in this margarita town. I preferred Jeff M.'s barrel aged Martinez to my Latin Cinema (tasted like a regular margarita to me). Onto the food--cheddar biscuits were delicious, and so was the corn off the cob and the chicken & waffles. The tuna entree was meh. Next time I am sticking to sides and apps."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner. This place is over priced, serves a very small amount of food. And the food tastes horrible. Avoid at all costs. We got the chicken wings, we got like 4 tiny wings. The burrata was tasteless and tasted stale."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for quite a while. I loved Brian M on Top Chef so I knew that his food would be inventive and fresh. Reservations are a must for dinner.  I started with my fave, a dirty martini. Very well made. Perfectly dirty, like I like it. :P  We were a group of 7 women so we all had cocktails and for food starters, we opted for the raw choices of poke and ceviche. Devine. Served very rustically on wood boards in mason jars. I kind of like the presentation....it was cute and unexpected. But the theme is throughout the decor as well, so it fits.  We moved on to share the calamari (and ordered another as it was THAT good) and the shishito peppers (just like everywhere else).  I ended with scallops that were wonderful and a few others had the salmon or steak. Everyone was pleased and satisfied.   This is a great option in Vegas.  It's a bit loud, but it IS in the casino. And of course, as most places in nice Vegas hotels, it's a bit pricey. But if you are out for a decent meal in a cute setting, definitely try Searsucker."}
{"text":"So excited that their Vegas location has opened! Searsucker San Diego has always been a favorite of mine. Plus now the Vegas restaurant is perfectly placed in Caesars next to Omnia Nightclub, and with extended hours. So we can grab some green eggs and ham (seriously! A must try) after working up an appetite on the dance floor. Best addition in a long time!"}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review! Prices listed below are happy hour prices as of 4/29/15.  The Skinny: excited to try their happy hour menu items and they are all pretty good albeit not without flaws(3.75) service is prompt and efficient at the bar(4) value: portion sizes are very generous for a happy hour menu and the food is solid for the most part. Service was good at the bar. (3.75 bump up to 4 starred review)   FYI -  signage is poor in Caesar's Palace so it is hard to find.  Searsucker is tucked away close to the sportsbook and next to the Omnia dance club.   We were totally jived to try out Searsucker's happy hour menu. We got duck fat fries ($4), the farm bird lollipops, the Caesar salad, the Strawberry/goat cheese/walnut salad ($6 each),  the tuna tartare,  the squid ($8 each), the crab cake and the short rib ($10 each). We were slightly disappointed that the burger on the online happy hour menu was gone but with their sizable menu,  this was easily overlooked. We were surprised but the serving size was very generous for each of these dishes especially the aforementioned $10 items and the two salads. We probably won't order that much again knowing how big the servings are.   Here is the run down:  Duck fat fries with tomato jam ($4): satisfying with a nice smokey flavor from the tomato jam. The hubs would have preferred a slightly crisper texture but I found them to be pretty good in that regard. Would order again.   Farmbird lollipops + hot sauce + Bleu ($6): these were more like chicken meatballs on a skewer. The flavor wasn't really hot per se. It tasted more like sweet and sour rather than hot sauce like -  kind of like Swedish meatballs. The Bleu cheese flavor was rather muted. Overall, this dish was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Pass on this.   Strawberry + champagne + goat cheese + walnuts ($6): get this! Delicious and lightly dressed,  the flavors married beautifully together. Protip: the goat cheese is adhered to on the bottom of the plate so make sure you give a good scrape before you dig in. Portion size is generous and could easily make 2 side salads.   \"Caesar\" romaine + kale + egg + parm ($6): okay Caesar. Honestly, the dressing did not have that  garlicky, fishy (from anchovies) punch and missed that hit of acidity in the end. The dressing was a bit too salty as well. Serving size again was very generous and could easily stand in as a light meal on its own. Would pass and get an extra strawberry/goat cheese salad instead.   Tuna + radish + taro + spice ($8): pretty good but it is still tuna tartare. The spice is very mild. The tuna was pretty tasty and good quality and worked well with the taro chips. Would order this again depending on the mood.  Squid \"sweet heat\" ($8): the good -  exquisitely tender squid that melts in your mouth, delicious sauces; the bad - dressed too heavily with the Thai chili sweet sauce so we lost the crispness of the fried batter. Overall would be better if both sauces served on the side to maintain the crisp exterior layer. Good dish but needs some refinement -  maybe order again with the sweet chili sauce on the side to see if that changes the dish.   Short rib \"the harlot\" + horseradish + fried onions ($10): very good portion size and easily could be a main entree sized meat portion. Fork tender short rib with a hit of horseradish near the end.  Served over mashed potatoes,  this is a very comforting dish. Personally I thought the gravy could use a little more acidity but that I think is more personal taste. The hubs wolfed this dish down. Would recommend.   Crab cake jumbo lump + fennel + airlines ($10): if you like crab,  you will like this. Lots of crab meat in chunks with minimal filler. A tinge too salty,  it worked well when mixed with the aioli and a good squeeze of lemon. Would order again.   Overall,  our dishes were very good in general and portion sizes for a happy hour menu are very generous. There is enough variety to satisfy most people,  sample some good eats for a reasonable price (for the Strip).  Service was excellent at the bar -  our water glasses were promptly filled and check taken care of quickly. Food arrived swiftly to the table as well. A solid 4 star experience."}
{"text":"This is without doubt the best happy hour I ever have here in Vegas as we as in Los Angeles. If you go to this place please try the burrata! It s AMAZING, great quality. Beer is very good as well ! I ll come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Nice service at the bar. Those happy hour sliders were good, but tiny (as in 2-3 bites max). The PBJ Old Fashioned was smoothe and tasty. Their Sucker Punch drink was my fave."}
{"text":"Staff is nice, friendly and knowledgeable. Ask for Zach at the bar. He'll dominate your taste buds with some delicious drinks. He's also a really friendly and helpful guy. Peter Rabbit was the best.  Once you're done with your drinks, order some Brussels Sprouts. I'm not actually a big fan of Brussels Sprouts, but they flavor these things to perfection. Calamari is thick and juicy. From what I'm told, they don't use the tentacles, they only use the real meat which is why it's so thick and tender.   For entrees you can't go wrong with any of the meat. Next time I'm going to try the Ribeye although it's a little spendy at 75 bones. But you get what you pay for and I'm a Peter Luger loyalist so I'm willing to pay for a solid steak.  End it off with the red velvet cake and the donuts. Red velvet cake isn't the thick, creamy and rich type that makes you feel fat. It's light, fluffy but still packed with the same amount of flavor. The donuts are soft and warm on the inside and comes with a dip. Awesome."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner, 2 of us ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, and 2 from the a la carte menu.  Overall the meal was wonderful. The cheddar biscuits were very greasy, cold and almost indelible.  They are thrown on to the table with no explanation as to what they are.  I'd forget these. I ordered a martini with 3 bleu cheese olives, was charged $14.00 for the drink, and to add insult to injury, I was charged $1.00 for the olives.  Very tacky!  One of my dining companions ordered a glass of house Chardonnay.  I'd say $13.00 for a glass of house wine is a bit much. On to the meal.  The food was delicious. I ordered the duck 3 x's, and was told there would be 3 preparations of duck in the plate. I could only find 2, and one was in edible. The sliced duck breast was awesome, but the tiny triangles of crispy skin were too greasy too eat, and quite unpleasant.   The other diners at my table ordered mahi and salmon and were big hits and quite tasty. Two desserts were red velvet cake, which had no discernible taste, but the chocolate mousse was outstanding. The 2 biggest flaws of the evening were asking to pay the $5.00 valet fee as we pulled the car up, and having our plates whisked away from us  as we were still eating.  One of my dining companions wouldn't allow his plate to be taken so the waiter stood there until he finished!  He whisked the plates away as though they needed them for other diners. Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Please please please bring back the Lollipop wings!!!!  We literally live locally and come to Searsuxker for Heather (best bartender in Vegas!) and the Lollipop Wings!!!!  We love this place but the wings must come back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We couldn't get a seat at Nobu. I remembered how great this place was when I first tried it.  So lucky we got a seat here right away!  Our server was absolutely amazing! Cute petite blonde.  She gave excellent suggestions and got us out in time for our show.    They've taken a few things off the menu since they first opened. Careful not to get your heart set on these amazing Yelp photos. Not to worry, everything is yummy!  They didn't give us any bread so we ordered the biscuits.  Can't go wrong.  Served with butter and honey.   Didn't feel like I was in the mood for her suggested calamari steak.  I am so glad she suggested it!  It was cooked to the perfect texture, firm and tender.  Even the sweet chili sauce that I wasn't thrilled about, paired really well!   We ordered the ribs instead of steak. Good thing our server told us steak would take too long to cook for our time frame.   Super tender atop mashed potatoes.  A few nice onion rings.    Bone marrow.  Comes with a good amount of Brussel sprouts (which I love at this restaurant). Plenty of marrow.  Maybe too much for two girls to eat.     I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the most amazing experience at Searsucker last night. I brought my friend Big Mike to one of my favorite spots in Vegas for dinner and drinks and had the greatest experience. I am a frequent visitor of Searsucker and have yet to find anything to complain about. However, in lieu of the incredible service I was lucky to receive last night, I finally felt it necessary to express my gratitude via Yelp.   I usually sit down at a table for dinner when dining here, but Big Mike insisted on sitting at the bar. His decision ended up being the greatest choice we could have made because of the incredibly attentive and friendly service we received from Jen, the coolest bartender I have had the pleasure of interacting with. And trust me, I've had my fair share of benders.   Jen was so genuinely kind and eager to please and make recommendations from the menu. She suggested some dishes I would never have ordered alone, and to my surprise, everything tasted better than ever before.   Big Mike loved Jen so much that he asked me to take his picture with her. She agreed, of course, without a glimmer of doubt in her eye - in the same fashion that she served us all night, in the way she made us feel comfortable - as if we were in the company of an old friend.  Jen made me love Searsucker even more and Big Mike won't stop bugging me about going back. I've never enjoyed eating dinner while sitting at the bar before last night. But if Jen is bartending, you can bet your life that's where I'll be.  So, thanks for being so rad Jen. Thanks for the delicious mixologist style cocktails and thanks for never making us feel like you were working. You look like you're having fun and that's so rare in the industry.   Cheers!   PS Peter Rabbits all night!!!"}
{"text":"The $5 parking fee didn't make a good first impression.  Waited for our table at the bar and were served after waiting about 10 minutes.  Then, service from our waiter wasn't much better. The $60 bottle of wine we ordered was bad and he brought us a different wine, his choice,which we enjoyed, but it was $80 when we got our bill!   Food was good but overpriced. Wine list prices were outrageous. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"A short review as I don't have much to say about the restaraunt.  I came here with 8 other people so we ordered a bunch of different appetizers. The Brussel sprouts and the calamari stood out but everything else was very average.  I then went to order the hanger steak. I was fairly disappointed as it was salty and the extremely basic.   The only food I really enjoyed was their dessert. I ordered the chocolate croissant with marshmallows (forgot the actual name). It was amazing and very unique.  For the price, there are much better options in Vegas. I enjoyed Mesa grill much more than Sear... Both are in ceaser's palace."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT HERE! Spectacular service and food from the appetizer to the dessert! I had (shared) the calamari, bone marrow, short ribs, scallops, brussel sprouts, cookies and milk, ice cream sandwiches, and the other one with the marshmallow on top (oh I sound like a pig!). HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Worth the price! Will definitely come back again when visiting"}
{"text":"Dinner and drinks with our son and daughter in law and friends.  Fun place.  Located in Caesars."}
{"text":"LOVE.  Duck fat fries.  Mushroom burrata toast.  Grapefruit radler (Steigl).  Anything else after that you're too happy to be thinking clearly, but I assure you it is all delicious and really fun.  One of my favorite places on the Strip, really a perfectly executed endeavor by all involved."}
{"text":"Went there hoping for some small plates we could share , had sliders that were very good. After that all downhill, tuna tacos were tasteless, split a shortrib..not sure how you can make meat that tender bland, someone should introduce the Chef to herbs, vegetables, salt. It was like they braised in tap water and stopped there. Split 2 sides corn and chorizo which was 50% raw tomato, devoid of chorizo. Potatoes with butter...just mashed potatoes, not bad but not great. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. My friend and I ordered the scallops and decided to share. They originally come with three per plate but our waiter was very sweet and said he would request for four. The scallops were very buttery and flavorful. They were on a bed of couscous with this green lime sauce that I ended up dipping everything in. We also had the brussels spouts that had a great crunch and nutty flavor. We had a side of the corn and it was so sweet and flavorful it went well with everything. It was a great dinner and atmosphere for myself and best friend to enjoy our time at our weekend girl trip in Vegas. Plus, because we dine there we got a token that allowed us to skip the line at Omnia which made our night even more! Truly a great restaurant, food, service and all."}
{"text":"We tried this for dinner tonight and i can honestly say we left with a wide smile and very impressed!  Everything is fresh, in other words the design is nice, the menu is appealing, the staff and and last but not least the food was really good, I highly recommend giving this place a try, it has earned my return business for sure.  We had ahi Tuna and squid (a cool way to serve essentially Calamari) with sweet and sour sauce and remoulade both super fresh and delicious. For entre hanger steak with fingerling potatoes, also perfectly executed.  One other thing to note is the fact that the entire menu is a good value and not overpriced.  Long story short we will be back."}
{"text":"I normally wont blast a restaurant on yelp, but this time I had too, especially when spending a lot of money for a great dining experience, and also at a celebrity chefs restaurant.  We came to Searsucker Las Vegas  on Christmas day. We have been to the one in San Diego for drinks, and it was so good we wanted to try vegas. Well it was disappointing. Especially when the GM of the restaurant is leaning agains the counter by the open kitchen, looking out to the tables while constantly being on his phone. We were there for 2 hours and for the 2 hours he was on his phone and didnt look up or come to any tables. The open kitchen is ment to he a show for the dining guests. Everytime i would look up to watch the show I was so distracted by the eye sore of the main manager engulfed in his phone. Grant it he may have been checking important emails but for goodness sake go off the floor to do so. Very taky. Very unprofessional. When i mentioned this to other people they also experienced the GM on his phone. Bad dining experience wont be back."}
{"text":"We've been back to Searsucker about 4 times and finally after the last time, decided we won't be giving it a second chance. Granted, the first time we went we had really high hopes, but we also were a bit more lenient in our review. The last few times have been so underwhelming. We've likely tried almost everything on the menu now with nothing really standing out-- not even the chicken and waffles (gasp!).   Drink menu sounds interesting in theory but feels more like the illusion of good drinks and not really good drinks."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, the food was interesting and whimsical even.  I enjoyed the pork belly and bone marrow the most among entrees. The emerghard was probably the best sundae I've ever had.  Only quibble is the little bread they bring out wasn't good and I didn't love the duck fat fries as much as I should've given I love duck fat. It's also somewhat pricey but it's the Strip"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what the rave is about.  The evening started out well enough - we didn't realize we'd need a reservation but was able to sit at one of the high tops near the bar.  The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.  We started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.  The reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.    The place is kept COLD.  We were near the vents, but still, by the time our food reached our table, they were lukewarm at best.  All in all, the service was inconsistent and the food is mediocre at best.  At such high prices, I'm not sure this will get them a revisit from me."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants in Vegas!! Brian Malarkey is a huge rising star in the culinary world. So happy this San Diego restaurant has made its way to Vegas. You've got to try everything you can and share the plates."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour to try the Duck fries because I heard they were amazing. They were good, but not the best fries in town. I'll have to come back & try more."}
{"text":"Nice reuse for an existing commercial space; decor is unique and interesting. Floor DJ adds to vibe.   Small plates unique, flavorful, and satisfying; we tried beef tartare, squid, chicken legs, and shrimp plates. Not one dish disappointed. Our one regret is that we did not pace the ordering as the dishes came out all at once and stymied an effort for a relaxing slow meal. Our 2nd regret was eating the complimentary cheddar puffs. Although the puffs were very good, they were also filling and nipped our appetites. The beef tartare was a true highlight with flash fried seaweed, capers, taro chips, and a quail egg.   Service was very friendly, attentive, and down to earth.  Valets definitely need an improved cone and thoroughfare area; it was awkwardly staged and did not have an obvious traffic flow to compliment the restaurant.  Wine menu appeared to be limited to minimum red bottle prices of $50. Hope I overlooked the reasonably priced wines - no one wants to be a sucker!"}
{"text":"We had drinks which were very good and we had appetizers.  I picked the chicken, franks and waflle. Delicious-ness! And we had the duck fat fries with tomato jam, which were okay.  I want to go back for dinner. We did see Donovan McNabb have dinner there, so that was kinda cool."}
{"text":"A disappointment. The food was good, and appropriately priced. Tasty cocktails and a nice wine program.  Why two stars? The service. We had an attentive busboy, but that's not the waiter. The waiter was late to the table, so he got the drinks, apps, and meals all at once. The app never came, nor was there water. He offered dessert, but how am I going to want that when there's a late Vegas bight ahead of me?"}
{"text":"Oh my God!!!! The food was delectable. We just had the  shared plates . 4 of them between 2 of us and it was enough. Forget about portion size, the fast of each and everyone one of those dishes was exquisite. We had the Calamari, Bone Marrow, Tomato Burrata & olives and Eggs &Bacon. I kid you not that this was the best meal in Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"So good I ate here twice.....  I needed a change from all the extremely pretentious spots on Vegas.  I wasn't even staying at caesars but came back after my first experience.   Happy hour old fashions from 5-7 we're legit. You get a nice selection of $9 old fashions and they were all good.....no skimping on the whiskey here.  Also for happy hour, they serve $2 dollar sliders, oysters and bone marrow.  Those selections alone could make a nice dinner.  But.....I also had a full meal....and it was delicious!  Small plates for dining was a great option for us.  Fried pig ears were awesome.  Octopus was awesome.  Short ribs was perfect.  Their poke starters were amazing...served on a fried seaweed chip.  The wings were a pleasant surprised as they were served in a unique way.  There were a few small plates that were ok but the variety we had made up for it.  The bar always had seating even during one of Vegas's busiest conventions. I'm giving this place 4 stars because I actually think I got my money's worth....and that says a lot when you're hanging out in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was invited here through work and it was great! I started off with the adult Arnold Palmer which is sweet tea vodka and lemonade (amazing!) then we had the short rib which was so tender and melts in your mouth! We then had the duck fat fries which were seriously the best fries I've ever had! Then we had the shrimp and grits which is in a red sauce and oh my gosh it's so amazing they come with so much shrimp it's so good! We then had at their signature pork butt entrée that came with a Southwestern corn which was so good and other mashed potatoes which was also very very very good! We then topped our meal off with some dessert we had there a banana split which had brownies chocolate ganache a caramelized banana and peanut butter and vanilla and chocolate ice cream which was heaven!! We also had their cookies which came with milk for dunking which I thought was really cute. The meal was amazing we even got to meet the chef and he came to our table introduce himself he's really nice guy.  I will definitely be coming back to this place it's a great place to go to if you don't want anything too formal and nothing too casual right in the middle it's great to go to if you're ready to start your night out in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Seasucker.  We made reservations for 8:15pm but needed to push that last minute.  Searsucker was quick to make the change without issue.  We were sat immediately when we arrived.  Our server warmed up after a couple of visits to our goofy table.  Strangely, some drama found Searsucker that night.  As cocktails were being delivered a young lady and her boyfriend started shouting at each other and ran into the back area of the restaurant.  This high level of tense arguing continued until security showed up to usher them out.  Searsucker handled it perfectly.  The good was awesome, best mac-n-cheese I've ever had (that's a BIG statement).  I would go back right now if that were an option."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I love it sooo much every time I come here I'm never disappointed with anything. The only thing is I wish sometimes the waiters wrote down their orders even if it's only two people my man and I order a lot and the last couple times they forgot one dish. But other than that the service still is great!!! And the food omg where do I start! The biscuits are a must!!! They take a while but super worth it. I always get the ceviche it's spicy just how I love it. The oysters are good super small but good! We also got the sliders they are ok I wasn't a huge fan but my man loved them! Lastly the tomato soup is a framing must o love it sooo much"}
{"text":"I have sensitivities and it is not easy for me to order. This was the third restaurant we tried, while staying at Caesars Palace. With a name like Searsucker-I figured beef only.   Our server was awesome!  He understood my needs and made a fabulous recommendation. The food was great!  I will eat there again. Sadly, I will not stay at Caesars again."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place!  The decor is very comfortable and well done to provide a relaxing environment.  The valet was very friendly and the service is excellent too once you arrive in the restaurant.  The food was really very good...the ono with tart cherry was delicious and we tried the whipped potatoes, cauliflower with manchego and the jalapeno corn off the cob...sinful!  The other three diners I was with thoroughly enjoyed their entrees as well - filet, pork chop and duck!  We finished off the meal with the donuts and the deconstructed apple pie...both of which were quite tasty too!"}
{"text":"My review is strictly based on the happy hour and frankly, I just wasn't impressed. My friends and I arrived at around 5:30pm and sat in the bar area (which had plenty of empty seating, a plus). We were quickly approached by an unenthused waiter who put off blaring vibes of, \"you're not going to tip much so I'm not going to waste my time.\" We ordered our drinks and they were definitely heavy poured but over priced even for happy hour. The food, however, was pretty good. I ordered the sliders and really enjoyed the sriracha mayo that came with it while my friends ordered the ahi tuna tacos and buffalo chicken pops (FYI, they don't have ranch)  Overall it was a bland experience and bland service (and an awkward \"is everything ok here??\" by the manager). Their regular menu looked interesting and I'd bet if I returned for an actual meal I would receive better service, but I probably wont return unless someone else was so inclined."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner with a group of friends!  The drink selection was spectacular as well as the food choices. We had 5-6 appetizers they were all good but my favorite was the the bone marrow.  The bone marrow was soft and silky accompanied by an array of different garnish to only accentuate the taste!  I had the short ribs, truly amazing maybe one of the best I've ever had with tangy mashed potatoes.   I can see this for both a group or date night!"}
{"text":"Had the seared tuna with greens and the chocolate desert.  Heavenly, a perfect lunch in a great setting.   Love the décor and getting to hear my companion and have a nice conversation without yelling is very special too!  All around, a WooHoo experience."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Daily 5-7pm  Happy Hour Specials are $9 Old Fashioned Cocktails, $5 Beer, $6 Wine, $2-$3 Bar Eats  Happy hour has gone downhill a bit.  Their happy hour menu has shrunk considerably.  No more discounted specialty drinks.  Only cocktails on the menu are 4 old fashioned cocktails.  Food options are oysters, sliders or bone marrow.  It's ok.  I just prefer the old happy hour menu.    Be sure to check out the dessert menu.  There are some great cocktails on there that are not on the regular drink menu."}
{"text":"I have never eaten a full meal in an office building lobby before. I felt like I was eating in an echo chamber at times. The conversion was nicely done. Waitress was outstanding. She knew the menu inside and out. Food was very good. My Pulled Pork was tender enough to cut with a fork. Presentation was fantastic. All side dishes were extra. Very unique menu with lots of items not available in your every day eating establishments like beef tartare, brussels sprouts, etc."}
{"text":"We chose this place because my husband wanted a steak, but we were unimpressed with other steakhouses' reviews and lacked any formal attire. We thought we would give searsucker a try and were pleasantly surprised.  Menu is reasonable, and we started our with potato fries (cooked in duck fat, side of chipotle ketchup). They were fantastic. The ketchup was too hot for my liking, and overpowered the subtle duck flavor, but my husband really liked it.  We ordered the braised ribs for me and the prime New York for my husband. The ribs came on a bed of mashed potatoes with 3 onion rings on top. The potatoes were supposed to be horseradish, but good for me they were not. The first bites were magnificent and I would absolutely get them again. Tender, rich, and flavorful!  My husband ordered his steak medium and, unfortunately upon his first slice discovered they had turned it into beef jerky. The waitress apologized and brought it back. She then returned to inform us that they had no more New Yorks. We expected the worse, especially since my husband really had his heart set on a steak. To our pleasant surprise, the waitress said the head chef was very sorry and that we could order anything as a replacement, suggesting their most expensive steak, a ribeye. Given the opportunity, my husband opted for the Tomahawk ribeye. A 36oz behemoth with an equally sized price.   I don't have all the words to describe the Tomahawk. It was amazing, melt-in-your-mouth, savory steak. That is what steaks should taste like. It's hard to fathom the $145 tag, but if you have the desire or a special occasion, do it. Do it. It's huge. It's fantastic. It's memorable.  The staff was good, the food was excellent, the atmosphere was great and they have an extensive beer and wine list, plus fun specialty cocktails. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We are a group of 12, and agreed that it was the best meal any of us had enjoyed in a long time. The steaks were tender and flavorful and scallops perfectly tender. Do yourself a favor and order the mashed potatoes, cauliflower and mushrooms as sides. The duck fat fries have a zing to them. Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by before a concert. BUSY LOUD  and FUN. DUCK fat fries are a must,  also had HAMACHI. BUT the highlight of the the meal were the 3 small biscuits in a small iron skillet. I am from the south and know biscuits but these were the best I have ever eaten-sorry GRANDMA. Light flaky and dusted with sugar we saved them for dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday with a group of girls for a bachelorette weekend of fun. This was our last night in Vegas and wanted to have an awesome dinner.   I mostly rated this place based on service..I mean maybe it would have been 3 stars if the food was better.  I was super hungover on Sunday so I only got myself a salad. I did try some of the other girl's food and it wasn't anything too special.  I really wish I remembered what our waiters name was, because for the response be gave me and the type of restaurant this place is, I would have expected kinder service.  One of the girls at the end of dinner asked our waiter for a togo box. As she asked him, I also asked him if I could get a box too. His response was, he pointed his finger in the air and told me to \"hold on, I can only do ONE thing at a time\" he said \"my assistant will box it up\" then he looked away and ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME and mummered \"okay\" to himself with crazy eyes and walked away.  I thought I was totally tripping when he did that to me, but 2 other girls saw what he did so I knew I wasn't tripping, nor did I say anything or give him attitude.  Then, we asked for dessert menu and he handed everyone their Happy Hour menu and walked away really fast. We had to ask \"his assistant\" for the right menu since he wasn't around.  I really don't know what was up his butt, maybe drugs or something but I've never been talked to that way nor had their eyes roll at me at a restaurant when requesting a box."}
{"text":"In town for combined business and pleasure, I went solo to Searsucker for my last dinner before heading home.  I ordered a glass of Malbec and the flat iron steak and potatoes.  All I can say is -- wow! The marinated beef was so flavorful and absolutely delicious. The potatoes were seasoned with garlic, parmesan cheese, onions and jalapeños -- sounds odd but it totally works. This was by far the best meal I've had in the few days I've been here, and I've done a good job of sampling some of the nicer restaurants. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"19/100 yep challenge  * Price: expensive; $200 dinner for two ( 1 share appetizer, 2 main dishes, 1 share desert, 2 drinks), 10%  higher than nearby gourmet restaurants. their food is delicious and large portion though. 3 star. * Ambience; casual , chic decor, not over the top. 4 star. * Location: Ceasar Palace but off the main food court area and the forum. We had to stop and asked for direction from 3 different restaurant hosts!  3 star. * Meals: delicious! Every bite is tasty and perfect! 5 star. * service: excellent! Everyone is very friendly and helpful! 5 star.  This is averaged to 4 star for me!  Came in on a Wednesday night and the place was half empty. We were a bit nervous but glad that we came.  The meal is perfect! Poke: fresh and perfectly seasoning served with taro chip. $19  Scottish salmon: perfectly glazed and tender! Chimichuri sauce is sweet and tangy taste which went well with the salmon. $36  Fish and chip:moist and tender with thin but crispy shell. $42.  Snore bar: graham, chocolate ganage, chocolate mouse packed in a bar served with chocolate ice cream. Not too sweet. The bar is perfect mixed between sweet, salty, chocolate softness and crunchy. $11.  We always are big fan for chef Brian Malarkey on Top chef and are not disappointed! The only reason that this place is not packed because of the price! Since there are so many restaurants by celebrity chefs nearby with 10-20% less, many people would chose others!"}
{"text":"Only had a hour before Elton show and needed food. Got great appetizers, especially the scampi, in a timely manner. Even had time for dessert, lemon cheesecake so yummy. Our waiter Steven was attentive and nice so I will be back. The reason for only 4 stars is the hummus was bland, but there is so many other things I want to try. Managers were even friendly and stopped by for a chat."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get into Omnia to see a DJ/Entertainer, Seasucker does a deal where you get expedited entry into the club. Only catch is that you'll need to spend a minimum of $55/person, but on the plus side you get three bottles of wine. However, that was the deal my part of 9 got.   Ordered the filet mignon which was double seared and on a bed of sautéed kale. It was delicious in my book, the chef did well on making it medium rare for me.   I don't recommend ordering the roasted cauliflower. My friend ordered some to meet our $55 quota, however we barely ate it. The seasonings were off and tasted sour, which could have been the pickled chilis.   If you come here to get a special deal to get into the club, just order a main dish and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"There are a lot of restaurants in Caesar's Palace and I ate at three of them. This was  the most expensive of the three. It was so expensive I ordered the hamburger. While the hamburger was good and also a good size, it was $25.   The bar served their mixed drinks in very warm glasses filled with large cubes so they put only a small amount of alcohol in them and just let them get watered down by the heat of the glass. That was disappointing. Ordered a bottle of wine and they brought out a different year stating they did not have the year represented on the menu. Not a big deal unless you were only willing to pay that high of a price and ordered a specific bottle and vintage off the menu because you knew it was a good year for that wine and also knew the bookend years were not as good...as was the case here. We did get an apology from the manager stating they'd intended to update the menu but hadn't yet done so. We sent the wine back before they'd opened it.   The staff was friendly and my dinner guests seemed to enjoy themselves. They were kind enough not order the $145 cowboy steak - for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"My office had our holiday dinner here on a Friday night. I loved the look of the place. We shared appetizers - the brie and the duck fat fries (sounds awful) were great. I had their house salad and a catch of the day served with drunk cherries and almonds and we shared some great sides and then some desserts. All the food was fantastic. I think my favorite thing was my drink though - the Honeybadger whiskey cocktail - yum! The service was really great as well. Our main server took great care of us and lots of runners helped throughout the night.  The restaurant was quiet and relaxed when we got there at about 7 and we had a good view of the bar, which slowly started to fill up and a DJ came in. By the time we left at almost 10, the consensus was that somehow it got colder and louder. Looked like a fun place to hang out on a Friday night, but it was a good time for our relaxed dinner party to leave."}
{"text":"The food reminded me of Applebee's and Fridays, not bad just not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the food because we didn't get to have any. Despite making a reservation for 11:30 a.m. brunch on Sunday, and the restaurant itself listing their opening time as 11:00 a.m., Searsucker was not open when we got there. I called the main line and no one answered, then I called again later, and they left me on hold for an unacceptable period of time. Unfortunately for them, they lost my business that day, and my future patronage as well."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8 and got seated quickly on a Saturday night.  My girlfriend and I split the beer braised short ribs (came highly recommended by the waitress) and the entree scallops.  The ribs were tender but the sauce was too salty for my taste.  The scallops were delicious and were plated on a bed of corn.  The food was decent and I would come back again to try other things on the menu.  edit: If you plan on going to the Omnia nightclub after dinner, ask the hostess at the restaurant and they can give you an express token that lets you cut through the Omnia line quicker."}
{"text":"My wife and I had no trouble making a reservation here the day before. When we showed up, the hostesses were polite, but not as welcoming as I would have expected. We were seated promptly.  The menu was very inviting and our server (who did not share her name with us) was very pleasant. She was very good throughout the meal - attentive, but not obtrusive, talkative, but not overly chatty. If I were offering a rating based solely on her service, it would have received a six.  We ordered drinks to start. I got the fizzy lifter and my wife got the blackberry smash. Both were very, very good with plenty of alcohol. In fact, we later ordered a couple more. The server readily provided us with a detailed description of how to make the fizzy lifter when we requested.  Our first appetizer was an order of shisheido peppers. Cooked perfectly, but a little salty. The ponzu sauce was a fantastic addition (its flavor made the small chunks of salt sprinkled on top unnecessary, in my opinion).  Our second appetizer was the short rib. Succulent and cooked perfectly, it was served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a wonderful gravy. This was the best part of our meal.  We split the hanger steak for a main course (we planned in advance for dessert). It was delicious! It was served on small potatoes and mushrooms with an appropriately sized drizzle of a chimichurri sauce that was (1) very good (me), or (2) ok (my wife). Overall, a fine selection to split.  We ordered the ice cream sandwich and the ice cream selection for dessert. While the ice creams were delicious (chocolate, salted caramel and cappuccino), the ice cream sandwich was the star. This is a must if you are a dessert person. Served on caramel and accompanied by a large dollop of fresh whipped cream, I was left attempting to lick the plate.  The decor was tasteful, but it was a little loud, being next to the casino. Overall, a very good place to pop in for a dinner.  We did not experience many of the negative things mentioned by other reviewers. If you go the Searsucker, I hope your experience equals ours."}
{"text":"Adventurous comfort food.  Is that an oxymoron?  Well, go to Searsucker and decide for yourself.  My advice, though, would be to take a good look at the menu first.  You will either spot some unusual dishes that you are dying to try, or (like me) you will decide this just doesn't look like my cup of tea.  I went here only because I was with a group that was staying at Caesar's and chose this restaurant.  I was looking for something less adventurous than the crispy pig's ears and such.  I might have ordered a burger, but the menu trumpets that they only make 20 of them per night.  How pretentious!  You might get one, or not.  I prefer to do my gambling in the casino, so I ordered tomato soup, a Cobb salad, and also split a mac & cheese and an order of cornbread with my wife.  The soup was okay; nothing special.  The Cobb salad wasn't.  I mean it wasn't a Cobb salad.  Greens and bacon mostly, with a vinaigrette dressing - closer to a Spinach salad.  The mac & cheese was very rich and quite good; I guess it's hard to mess up that dish unless you load it up with truffles, which (thank God) they didn't.  The cornbread really should have been the complementary bread plate, but if they insist on charging five bucks for it - well, that's how it goes.  My wife did like her brick chicken.  Seersucker tries to brand itself as a comfortable party place.  I didn't see it that way.  It had a weird ambiance, with giant fish skeletons and pictures of roosters on the walls.  The bar area was not comfortable, and the bar service was slow.  I'm not going to comment on the dining room service because, as I said, we were with a group and it is entirely possible that someone in the group was slowing things down with a lot of questions and dithering.  However, the place did seem to be understaffed.  Well, at least the prices were reasonable (by Caesar's Palace standards)."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed everything I've had there, cocktails, lunch & happy hour. Good presentation and atmosphere. Good service and wine list."}
{"text":"Looks good great atmosphere & great service. However our food was enough to where we were not hungry which is normally perfect for me. I don't like waste and oversized portions. I had the steak cauliflower it was decent flavor and I kept my calorie count in check but seriously there was nothing but mashed up gooey looking tomatoes served with it. No sides whatsoever to compliment the dish. The spice chicken my husband had was flavorful but he ate every morsel and also had nothing but tomatoes on the side which he does not like and didn't know they were part of the dish. So basically we are saying we felt like suckers for choosing Searsucker :( wine list and prices not fair definitely overpriced and I'm not referring to overpriced as expected."}
{"text":"Ah.maz.ing! delicious food, perfect ambiance, a lot of unique and boutique items to choose from. Perfect service and managed by pros. Chef is outstanding! Must try!!"}
{"text":"I love all the Searsucker locations. The San Diego locale is my favorite, but this incarnation at Ceasar's Palace is very good as well. The service is good, the drinks inspired, the menu totally solid, and the desserts make me not want to share.   The Tuna Poke & Shaved Taro Root was a great start. The Kale & Romaine Caesar salad is a good next step towards one of Malarkey's wonderful steak dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed the filet with smoked fingerling potatoes and a Honeybadger (and a Matador.) To finish, we tried the Chocolate Trifecta, and I think it's my new favorite.  I love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Searsucker was a good restaurant.  Of the offerings at Caesar's, it is my favorite.  I had an amazing steak dish and my girlfriend's tuna was equally amazing.  I liked the decor of the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Service is kind of slow but extremely attentive.  Food was spectacular. We had a table of nine and everything I tried was awesome. I recommend getting the ceviche with some toast (to dip into the sauce).The pickles are also very good if you like spicy things.  I think next time I would try the mushroom buratta toast or the beet salad.  My only complaint was that the lettuce in the Caesar salad was too large. Smaller cuts would have been easier to eat."}
{"text":"Very happy with this spot. Came to Vegas during March Madness. So a spot to eat REALLY good food, have good drinks, and good service, and have good seats to watch the games....?! Works for me.   We came here for breakfast/brunch every day during our stay. At times felt like the service was a little slow. But the food was well worth the wait. The service was also incredibly friendly, personable, and knowledgeable of their menu. We did not have one bad meal their.  The pricing is not cheap. Not super expensive either. But hey, everything is over priced in Vegas. At least the food is so good, the value for the money spent redeems itself.   The booths fill up quickly, so I recommend getting a reservation if you have a group of more than 2-3 people. Otherwise, there is a pretty good shot you can walk right in and get a spot at a bar top table or at the bar.   Definitely a go to while staying at Cesar's /)"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, service, the works. I came to Searsucker to watch game 3 of the World Series and have dinner with co-workers. The pork ears especially stood out, as well as the cocktails. Ask about the Omnia package-- spend $50 and you get a chip that allows you to cut the line. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I would go back here in a SECOND!! The food was LEGIT! So GOOD!!   Definitely make reservations, it was busy! We were seated at a lovely \"people watching\" window seat. It was great. We were going to see a show, so we kept it pretty simple.  Ordered a caesar salad to split, and our entrees.  The two entrees we had were Beef Ribs with horseradish mash. YUM!!! And very filling!! The other was a piece of grilled swordfish which included a choice of sauce and side. Both were fantastic.  The \"share plates\" looked so interesting, I want to go back just to site and nibble on little social plates! So many interesting things on there that looked good to try!  As for service, I have noticed many criticisms for bad service, I am happy to say that absolutely was not our experience!! The woman who was helping us was attentive and an asset to the dining experience."}
{"text":"Ill suited to my vegatarian preferences, most menu items were a big slab of meat. Even the mussles had chorizo.  Strange location too.  Wouldn't take reservations on Open Table, but then the restaurant was 3/4 empty when we stopped by without a res.  There were two elements I will compliment: nice wine list, and delicious dessert served in large portions."}
{"text":"Great drinks... can't beat happy hour. Had the sliders.... fantastic. Service was good. Nice location. Would def come back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The Assistant General Manager, Nick came by and checked on us. He was extremely friendly and answered any questions we had. Thank you for giving us the story on why the restaurant is called Searsucker!   Try the snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich!! It's AMAZING! Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to go to Searsucker since it opened, so I decided to go for my birthday with our house-guests in town from Washington.   Needless to say, expectations were high. I am happy to say Searsucker delivered!  I had the Mahi Mahi and it was so good. Others at the table had the duck, the loin filet, and the scallops. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal.  The sides are family-style which was great for trying a few options.  My favorite was the jalapeño-chorizo corn-off-the-cobb, but we all also the fried brussels, and the cauliflower were tasty.   Now, on to the drinks. The cocktails were amazing!!  Between the four of us, we had several different options.  My fave was the Peter Rabbit.   The atmosphere and service were also wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Searsucker in Vegas.  They have a good happy hour during the weekend.  The dish are small, but what else would you expect.  They had about 5 or so cocktail options.  We tried almost each one.  Pretty good!"}
{"text":"So close to five stars! The succulent short ribs are too die for as are the vinegar Brussels sprouts and walnuts... But both were served barely warm.  Friendly service.$$$+"}
{"text":"Searsucker has given me a new reason to visit the strip. As a native, I tend to avoid the area. This restaurant makes you feel right at home, and takes you away from Vegas just for a moment. From the hospitality, to infused liquors, Searsucker has won me over in every single way. My first trip here was a Yelp event, where of course we were spoiled. However, when I returned for a ladies night with Jessie B., we were still spoiled! The chef sent out a complimentary dish when we first arrived which really set the tone. The service was stellar beginning to end. And the food, let's talk about the FOOD!  The salads are so fresh, I literally could eat every single one of them. The crab cake is the best crab cake I ever have tasted. That particular night Jessie and I shared the special, a fettuccine made in house topped with fresh pesto, shrimp, and mussels. WOW. My mouth waters as I type. I could see the chef from where I was sitting and he seemed so passionate when plating our dishes. You could tell they really care about what comes out of their kitchen.  After our meal we went to the bar to try one of these amazing cocktails. I went with the Bad Bad TRoy Brown, and I only needed one! It was strong, but perfectly made. The bartender warned me that it was not a weak drink.  The manager even came by the bar and spoke to us, mentioning happy hour. Speaking of happy hour, I need to plan a trip back here, and soon!"}
{"text":"I've had the chance to eat here twice! Once was for an event, so we had appetizers being passed... and everything was great.  Came back with friends for a proper dinner.  The three of us decided to order a variety of the \"small plates\", including the cowboy caviar, the bone marrow, snakebite lollipops, quail and mussels.  We were under the impression that \"small plates\" would be small... but, we WAY over ordered.  The small plates were large, in our opinion.  I could have had the qual by myself as a filling meal.   But, hey, that makes this place a fantastic value!!    Food was fresh, creative, and everything was absolutely delicious.  My hubby raves about the bone marrow!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"What do I say about this gem - great food, great service, fun atmosphere.  I've said it all before, but Searsucker checks all the boxes AND captures that extra special something.  The people here are terrific and make you feel special.  The room is energetic and fun, and the music is always on point.  Then you start eating; beef tartare, eggs & bacon, short rib, crab cake, mahi and cherries, pork butt!  Or splurge and get the tomahawk!  And you should drink a Honey Badger or a Matador because why not?!  Don't skip the chocolate chip cookies - I'm not kidding.  They are life changing."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are the best thing...with amazing presentation. If you leave without trying the Rocky Road Bread Pudding, you are a fool. It is sheer delight."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from San Diego and visit the Valley Ho Hotel regularly in the Old Town district close to Fashion Square. Being familiar with the Searsucker Brand and Brian Malarkay, we were excited to check out the latest addition. It is fabulous!! The decor, vibe music, food and drinks. Well worth checking out.We both enjoyed how cozy it feels. We met the Managment Staff Owen and Les and had a nice chat with them. Both very professional and courteous. We were even more impressed with our server Amy. She is a 10!  Hard to find that level of service anymore. Can't wait to come back on our next trip!!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food. Had the bad bad t-roy brown to start and the peter rabbit which were both amazing. Moved to a table and our server was extremely knowledgable. ( Sorry I forgot his name) The green peppercorn reduction was damn good on the Aged Strip and those butter potatoes were on point. Thanks for being our last meal in Vegas before coming home to NY!"}
{"text":"Went last week during happy hour. Had the bone marrow and it was wonderful. I think we ordee about 3-4 of them. Tried the oysters and sliders and didn't really care for it.  Definitely coming back for the bone marrow!"}
{"text":"Hip and fashionable, Searsucker was a delight. The music sounded like one of my playlists, making it even more delightful. The food, fairly eclectic.  Searsucker's menu definitely marches to the beat of a different drummer with it's crab mac 'n cheese, lobster dumplings, and shrimp in bacon grits.  Other notables were the cauliflower in creme fraiche, and the short rib entree.  On the cocktail side, the Honeybadger brought a tear to my eye. The same drink concoction my late mother used to give us kids when we were sick....bourbon, honey and fresh squeezed lemonade, this drink was not only delicious, but brought back a flood of precious mom memories.  Searsucker isn't for the vanilla lover, it's geared more toward the peanut brittle, fudge chocolate cherry lime ice-cream lover."}
{"text":"Been twice now and think it may be one of our favorite restaurants. Service has been excellent both times and the food was delicious. Exceptional wine list and large appetizers can make a meal. Price is just right for the creations. I have never been disappointed by size for money. Highly recommended the Vegas location..........as for the Austin location, we'll let's just say I'm a car ride away and haven't been yet............."}
{"text":"Hosted a group event here on a Monday night. We had the bar/lounge area to ourselves which was great. The waiters came around and took drink orders, they were very fast and efficient. Our group of 30 was sat a two large tables in a partially private area. We started with the lollipop wings, ahi tuna tacos and calamari steak. WOW. The lollipop wings were amazing, the heat on them was seriously perfect. I loved the way they were trimmed too, the least messy wings I have ever encountered. For my entrée I got the steak that came with a roasted pepper. There were brussels sprouts for sharing as well. The steak was seasoned perfect, I ordered mine medium and it was a tad under, I didn't eat the center because it was a bit too purple for me, but that's personal preference. For dessert we had the assorted cakes and chocolate chip cookies, these were probably the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. I'm not a huge sweets person but I ate 3. THREE.   The service during dinner was great as well.   Prior to planning the dinner the event staff was awesome! They were always quick to respond to any questions I had, adjusted our time when I arrived late for the event and were accommodating when a guest didn't want anything from the preset menu. Thank you so much for a great evening!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the drunken steak, description said it was a beer grilled steak with crispy potatoes.  They did bring me a steak and crispy potatoes but the steak was a thin, pre-sliced steak with chimichurry sauce and an entire ocean worth of salt. It was disgusting. The crispy potatoes weren't any better, they were drenched in salt and had grilled jalapenos and onions mixed in with parmesean cheese. I don't think the fries would have been too bad if they didn't have so. much. salt.  I was so convinced that they didn't bring me the right dish that I even asked the waiter, who confirmed that it was indeed the drunken steak. I'm still not convinced he didn't mishear me.  The service was mediocre. It took about 10 minutes to get my check after I asked for it."}
{"text":"This place is TOP NOTCH! I love trying new things and if you are down to try something different this is the place to go. Everything is awesome including the drinks. Peter rabbit is a great drink and different. Love it!"}
{"text":"A few nights ago my fiancé and I wanted to have a quiet dinner so we decided on searsucker. Once the waitress approached she seem very genuine and pleasantly nice. She seemed to know the menu like the back of her hand. She mentioned a grilled salmon as the special that night and I went for it. She explained the entree with such details I couldn't say no. Once the salmon got to the table it was noticeably raw. If we wanted sushi we could have gone to a sushi restaurant. I asked the waitress if maybe I could get a salmon that was cooked through as this raw fish wasn't to my liking. She said \"oh yea I forgot to tell you it comes pink\" what?! Lol anyways once the second plate came to the table is was the exact same one that they took but only this time they they threw it back on the pan to warm it up and brought it back. By the way this is a \"health code violation!\" I was supposed to get a brand new salmon! Did you run out of salmon ? You had to bring me the same cut up salmon and drizzle a little sauce on the side! I was so embarrassed for them! Never again! Thanks for charging me full price $165!  Very classy."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude and very unhelpful. Server was non personable and slow. Food was just ok. Had the pork butt and it was not the best. The bussers were the nicest and most friendly."}
{"text":"After spending many hours researching the best place to eat Thanksgiving dinner in Vegas, we wound up here completely by chance and had hands down the best turkey meal of our lives (sorry grandma, but it's true).   Once we got to town we noticed that EVERYONE was doing a holiday dinner. Prix fixed menus were constantly in our faces, and we felt overwhelmed by all the different choices. Should we keep it casual, find a swanky place and dress up, hit a buffet, hide and order room service? The last one was starting to sound very appealing.   We were sitting across the way at the Alto bar watching the Cowboys game, when I spotted their sign advertising $50 a person for an all you can eat dinner. Wanting to be done with the search I asked around our table if that would do, and we all agreed to pull the trigger and make the reservation so we could relax and get back to the game.   We came back that evening expecting to find a buffet setup with long lines, but instead were treated to a practically empty restaurant and sat in an intimate candle lit booth. Our waitress brought out waters and not even 10 minutes later we all had the piping hot thanksgiving special plates sitting in front of us.   We were given the choice between white, dark, or both cuts of turkey. Each plate also came with mashed potatoes, green beans with crispy onion strings, fresh cranberry sauce, and sausage stuffing. Because we were feeling gluttonous, we also started with the $5 plate of biscuits with whipped butter and honey. HEAVEN!  The turkey was incredibly tender (I refuse to use the M word but it was), the mashed potatoes creamy and rich with the addition of the sour cream sauce on top, the green beans fresh, and crispy onions on top deliciously salty...just man. It was delicious.   None of us really cared for the cranberry sauce, but that's usually an afterthought anyhow. I'm just as happy with the canned stuff if I'm honest and theirs was a little too citrusy for me. And while I enjoyed the sausage stuffing, I found myself missing the meatless version so that it wasn't in competition with the turkey.  Truly dynamite meal though. We all got seconds (some even thirds, don't judge) and left blissfully dreaming about getting back to the room and changing into stretchy pants.  It was hard to determine what their normal cuisine is as we saw deer antlers, fish bones, and ropes decorating the room but honestly? I don't care. I would come back anytime and would be happy with any plate they set in front of me. It was absolutely delectable and worth every freaking penny."}
{"text":"Second time visiting Searsucker and this place has gone downhill, bigtime. We arrived with no reservation to grab a quick bite and were told the wait was over an hour for a table. Seeing there were plenty of vacant tables we hopped on opentable and made a reservation for 15 minutes later. The hostess wasn't thrilled about this, but I'm not sure why she didn't just accommodate us when we arrived.   Since we had 15 minutes to kill we figured we'd sit at the bar to pass the time. After being ignored for at least 5 minutes a bartender approached us. He took our order and we then were approached by three different bartenders asking if we had been helped yet. Again, weird. Needless to say, we ditched the table and just decided to eat at the bar.   Appetizers arrived in less than 5 minutes. Awesome, but it definitely makes you feel like nothing is prepared to order. Either way, our salad and tuna poke tasted great.   Then we waited for the entrees.   And waited.   And waited.   We asked three times and each time the response was \"oh it's coming right up\"  After 35 minutes we had to leave for an event so we asked to close our check and were charged for our entrees that we never recieved. Weird.   We let the bartender know we never received the entrees so we didn't want to pay for them. He said \"oh, sorry\" went and adjusted our bill and dropped it off without saying anything. After he ran our card he dropped it off and said \"Thanks guys!\"  Honestly, not something I would expect from a restaurant like Searsucker. The entire experience was irritating enough that there's no real reason to return. When I go somewhere to eat, I generally hope to at least be served my food."}
{"text":"Love the tomahawk!  My favorite steak of all Las Vegas restaurants.  The steak tar tar is a great starter and I always get the cauliflower as a side.  The short rib is also to die for but I would take the Tomahawk over anything else.  We sat at the bar this time and our awesome waitress Heather was very attentive and made sure we were happy."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Main courses were horrible. Do not waste your money, appetite or time. The only thing that will keep this place open is the appetizers. If you have to come here, sit in the bar and order wine and appetizers. Their \"specialty cocktails\" contained 0 alcohol."}
{"text":"If you want a smooth but settling drink I would recommend the skinny Jenny, very light on the stomach to cleanse the taste buds. We started off with the pickles and jalapeños, not too salty but a slight kick at the end balanced out the saltiness of a pickle. The calamari was amazing, the first bite had spicy tastwhich complimented the gamy taste of calamari.The chorizo corn has a citrusy first bite and the aftertaste puts in a slight kick that makes you feel like you are eating more than just corn. The short rib with the combo of the mashed potatoes and gravy melts in your mouth, the tenderness of the short ribs is off the chain.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want to satisfy your pallet."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon it in Caesar's Palace and was pleasantly surprised. Hostess initially wouldn't let us in w/ outside drinks but when she saw my struggle to \"chug\" a full vodka tonic she eased up & told me to say it was H20. Appreciate that!  Our waiter was kinda a jerk (Steven) and seemed not to have patience with the 2 of us. He didn't explain the menu when we had questions, completely forgot a drink order and then left us once our food arrived. Asked for a steak knife for our cauliflower steak (delicious) but never got one and had to use a butter knife to cut.  The busser tended to us with refills and was nice- Steve appeared with the bill and that was all.   Food was delicious and highly recommend the pig ears. Not crunchy but not soggy and the cilantro w like was IDEAL for a shared pre dinner nosh.   Cauliflower steak was perfect; not too heavy and the sauces were paired perfectly.   Duck fat fries were good but alittle on the salty side."}
{"text":"Habanero + coriander pickle ($4): the spicyness doesn't kick in until you eat it...I would not recommend if u cannot handle spicy food.  Mahi \"Baja\" ($33) - fish with drunken cherries and smokey almonds.  I wasn't a fan of the drunken cherries, but the smokey almonds with the fish was good.  Perfect if you will be going to the club next door after dinner. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I'm consistently happy with every bite! Never mind that this is the best place to be for seeing reasons why Scottsdale landed on one of the Top Ten Worst Dressed (hey, tiny dresses without spanx and blinged jeans with tattooed shirts clearly appeal to middle class masses), so the people watching is wonderful.... But the highlight is definitely the food! I'm a snob when it comes to shrimp & grits, and I was ready to write an Ode to the Chef with my first bite. The mussels taste good, but are hit or miss - tonight I had some grit, and that is a preparation issue (and not in the happy bacon grits way). The cocktails are as delicious as they are playful, and I can't seem to get enough of the crisp, clean flavor of the Peter Rabbit. I sort of want to go read about how Flopsy and Mopsy are doing... But maybe I'll just have another cocktail and tackle the giant scallop with bacon caramel sauce! You know, come to think of it, I haven't had an entree yet because I eat to my palate's delight from the awesome small plate selection!"}
{"text":"What a snazzy addition to a tired business building in Scottsdale! Before the arrival of Searsucker, I drove by this building on a daily basis and never gave it second thought. However, now everyday I drive by, it makes me want to stop into Searsucker because I am meow a fan!!   First, I love the atmosphere. They completely opened up the ceiling with sky scrapers placed throughout the restaurant. In addition to the sky scrapers, trees grace floorboards which make it feel like an indoor garden. The furniture's modern and earthy which matches the fresh vibe. You can see the chefs making the food in the kitchen and an open bar area holds comfortable couches as well as high tops. It's very fresh and airy for being inside a corporate building!   Now let's move on to the food, oh my the food! I can only review the lunch menu since I've only been for lunch, but if the dinner menu's anything like lunch, then I'm a fan. My two menu highlights are the Havarti turkey sandwich and the delectable chocolate caramel peanut bacon sundae! That might not be the correct name, but that's how I like to describe it! The Havarti Turkey sandwich has freshly roasted turkey with a cranberry jam, sprouts and fresh cracked wheat bread. It's accompanied by a salad and a perfectly fresh lunch.   I enjoy a leisurely lunch at Searsucker and especially enjoy their delicious craft cocktails at night!   **** Checklist: visit for weekend brunch soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Searsucker?  I was blown away.  Literally.  Never have I wished I could give a sixth star on a review before.  We went to Searsucker on a Saturday night before a Penn and Teller show.  We started off with the Frites - usually just fries.  But these were other-worldly.  Seasoned perfectly, and fried to perfection.  I went to heaven.  Thinking we were in some carb induced haze, we ordered the sliders after that.  A small bite of perfection.  Thinking we needed some veggies, my dining partner ordered the brussel sprouts and I ordered the heirloom carrots.  We were both blown away again and I can say it's the only time I have ever tasted brussel sprouts and thought they were good.  Like really good.  Back on the protein trail, we ordered the short ribs and this was the coup de gras.  This was easily the best \"small plate\" dinner we have ever had.  The service was also outstanding.  I just wish I was back in Vegas to go again and try more of their tasty food.  Do yourself a favor and get over to Searsucker as fast as you can.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Man, I became so tired of spending a ton of money on lackluster meals.  This was one of them.  It's like this restaurant thinks they'll never see you again, because you're a tourist and all, so the food is meh.  It's like they didn't even really try and they want to be something they're not.  Our female server was a doll, however."}
{"text":"We were 3 for dinner here a few nights ago. I have been a big fan of Searsucker since discovering it in San Diego a few years ago. I had mentioned at that time that the Pork Belly entree I had would be a contender as a last meal request should I ever be condemned. On this visit, my wife and I and our friend decided to share some small plates and then choose entrees. We had the Tuna Poke which was excellent and served with crunchy tortilla crackers. We also had the grilled Shishito peppers which  wonderfully seasoned with soy sauce and not too hot, though with Shishitos you never know when you'll get a real burner! We also had the spicy shrimp ceviche which was served with crispy taro root chips. All three were superb! For the mains both our friend and I had the Pork Butt (The Pork Belly I longed for was not on offer) However, the Butt was tender and perfectly cooked, and was served with some sides that I also really liked but don't recall just now. My wife had the scallops, which is always a fave of hers and these did not disappoint! They shared a slice of lemon cheesecake which they described as \"pretty awesome!\" All around this is a fantastic place for dinner.  The only thing I would say that misses the mark at this location is that it's slightly too bright and they had huge TV's playing Monday night football at top volume, that made it difficult to have a normal conversation. The other Searsucker location was intimate and dim and would be a great date place, this location seems to be more like a sports bar which was incongruent with the food offerings."}
{"text":"Great vibes, great food, and an overall great experience. From the moment I entered Searsucker, I felt a welcoming ambiance that lingered the whole night.  Started the dinner with their duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup and the short ribs. The fries were amazing and the short ribs were tender and succulent.  For mains, I ordered the loin \"filet\"  with lobster butter and mushroom demi. The filet was cooked to the perfect temperature. I also tried some of the salmon which was also delicious as well.  Now, my absolute favorite part of dinner was the dessert. I tried the S'mores bar and the Cookies  and Milk. Both were perfect toppers to a delicious meal. Never thought a ordinary food combination like milk and cookies could actually taste so unique.  The staff and management were very welcoming and provided me and my group with a unique and great dining experience. Managers stopped by our table to greet us, and even Chef Brian Malarkey stopped by our table to ask us how everything was.   Definitely a must-see in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"for the Yelp event... great location and great food and great atmosphere. although the tastings were heavy on the meat, we were able to sample a few options. the brussel sprouts at the pig table were grilled, crispy, salty, and crunchy just perfectly. the mashed potatoes at the rib table were divine...very smooth, creamy, almost pureed but not as runny. we sampled many, many items from the food art table courtesy of Chef Chop.  the cheeses, tiny mushrooms and pickles, the sauces, the caviar (i think), went oh so well together.  our drinks, the popcorn margarita and the lemonade were well made and had plenty of alcohol to give some buzz.   a great restaurant for meat eaters i'm sure. i hope they make it!"}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty skeptical of celebrity chef restaurants but was happily proven wrong last night! Our meal was fantastic from start to finish. We were also on a time crunch bc we had a show to catch and our waiter got us in and out very quickly ! We had the tomato and burrata, the bacon Mac n cheese, the sliders, and the lobster tails with Brussels sprouts. Every single dish was fantastic, we will be back for sure ! Also ordered a FRESH lemonade and it was unreal."}
{"text":"If you're planning on clubbing at Omnia, Searsucker is a great choice for dinner. Casual ambiance with fancy beer food and a ton of carbs so your body can handle the dance and drink throughout the night.  I tried the following:  -Bone Marrow: Massive! Usually with bone marrow, you're fighting over it with the people you're with because you're all sharing one dinky bone. But one order here has 3 massive bones topped with a chutney and tons of crisped brussel sprout leaves.  -Mac n Cheese: I've never seen mac n cheese made with the wheel-shaped pasta that you see in kids' meals. It works though because the cheese sits in between the crevices. And if it wasn't already creamy enough, there's a huge dollop of sour cream on top.  -Sliders: Taste was fine but it was over cooked and too charred.   -Duck Fat Fries: Definitely a must get! I don't how they cook these but every millimeter of the fries are crispy. The ketchup tastes housemade too (not sure if it is).  -Biscuits: My favorite item of the night. You can taste the butter that went into the making of the dough and then top it with more butter. It just gets better and better. It's not extremely flakey but super moist. It comes out piping hot.   Portions are huge. Service was so so. Water was always filled but when we told the server about the over cooked sliders, she didn't offer to take it off the bill. She just said she wish we told her earlier so she could make us a new plate. It wasn't until we told the manager that they compensated us for it."}
{"text":"We always go here on a Vegas trip.  The drinks are we'll crafted.  Service is great.  Sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen if you like to people work while you are having fun.  I flipped them a hundy last time in (I was on a roll and shared the wealth.)   For something festive and different, have the bone marrow followed by a bourbon shot down the funnel."}
{"text":"Searsucker? That is quite a different name though don't be fooled by it. This restaurant that labels itself \"The New American Classic\" has quite the bit of flavor packed into it. The appetizers, entree, and desert was a delicious and full-filling meal. Let's now eat our way into \"The New American Classic\" Searsucker. This fabulous restaurant is located in Caesars Palace in the casino section.  The first appetizer I sunk my teeth into were the lollipop wings ($18.00) these were some of the best wings I have ever had. The lollipop style they were served as were brand new to me however.  Genius! I exclaimed they were perfect; the meat all on one end was a masterful idea for dipping. They were smothered in buffalo sauce; they were spicy but not enough to scare me away. They were served along with a blue cheese fondue that was creamy and went great with the lollipops of a carnivores dream.  Next I had something very new to me and straight from the sea. These were raw oysters ($3/each) they were served in a bucket of ice and served along with a pomegranate topping. They smelled very fresh and fishy almost as if they just netted and prepared them right then and there. From a bite they have no flavor but with the pomegranate topping gave it a sweet flavor and made them easier to go down the pallet.  Then I went on to my favorite course the entree I had beer braised short ribs ($35.00). They were served along fried and crispy onions ring all on top of mash potatoes smothered in gravy. The ribs were tender and I could cut they with just the edge of my fork. The mashed potatoes were very light and fluffy and went with the meatiness of the ribs. Onion rings I love to death however the ones I have were a bit too greasy for my taste and I wish they were a bit crispier on the fry.  Last but truly not least was the desert crafted in my dreams three ice cream sandwiches ($18.00). Two were served vanilla and one...CHOCOLATE!!!! (those who get that sponge-bob reference you are amazing) there was a side of whip cream, Nutella, and mocha cream. The cookies on the sandwiches had that great homemade taste and the ice cream tasted freshly made. The chocolate sandwich had these wonderful chocolate almost coco puffs placed around it. The Nutella had a great chocolate punch and the whip cream was great. The mocha cream however was a bit strong but great on the sandwiches.  Ah! America the home of the brave and free with some of the best food you could taste. Searsucker is only a bite of what you can have here and is a great first stop. Warm and filling the food is just like its decor a truly great foodie stop.  Let's see where my taste buds take me next!"}
{"text":"Service is exceptional here. Les went out of his way to make us feel welcome and followed up with us the next time we were in even remembering our names. The Rum and Coke dessert is epic and you HAVE to try the Eggs and Bacon!!"}
{"text":"We were welcomed back and they more than made up for it.    My rating as of right now. This is based on the poor customer service I just received. I booked my reservation online and confirmed it via phone. They call today to tell me it is being pushed till later, which was unacceptable due to other plans. It's my wife's birthday and this ruined our evening plans. Would have liked to try the food, maybe another time."}
{"text":"I'm a big Top Chef fan so when I heard Chef Brian Malarkey opened up his San Diego restaurant in Caesars I had to stop by. Not having much time, we decided to just try a few dishes at the bar. BTW, their happy hour menu is really awesome here. I've posted a pic of it.  Crab cake was awesome. I can say the best I've had. Loved all the elements that came with it including the aioli and Tabasco caviar.  Squid was nice. Not your typical fried calamari. It's a slice up a calamari steak, batter, fried and tossed in a sweet mild chili sauce. Think calamari steak fries.  Duck fat fries were nice but chipotle ketchup threw it off for me. We asked if they have regular ketchup, they don't. The fries have a crisp that you won't get frying with typical oil.  After some amazing apps, the short rib underwhelmed. It was very typical and a bit bland.  I like my drinks sweet, this is not the place for sweet drinks. We had the Indian Summer and Achilles Peel. Achilles Peel was better but we had to ask for simple syrup.  Our server Lindsey was super cool. She was friendly, knowledgeable and was on top of everything we needed.  Will be back for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant in Vegas while walking towards Omnia Nightclub at Caesar's. The club was not open yet and we had about 1 hour to spare so why not a little grub before clubbing? I had actually bookmarked this place before our trip so by faith, we ended up here.  The dining area was nice but we just sat the bar and got a bunch of appetizers to share and a specialty cocktail for each. For grub, we had Crispy Pig's Ears w/ cilantro, lime, sea salt, the Duck Fat Fries w/ parmesan, prosciutto, herbs, and the Bone Marrow w/ fresno chili bourbon glaze. Both presentation and taste were on point. Ears were crunchy and tangy. Fries were perfectly crisp but the Bone Marrow was the clear winner. It was so tasty and slimy in very good way. Wish we ordered another one. For drinks, I tried the Snake in The Grass made w/ cucumber gin, bruised mint, lime, and soda. It was well prepped, refreshing and strong. My buddy got the Japanese Manhattan made w/ Toki Japanese whiskey, sweet vermouth, orgeat, sake, and bitters. He let me have a sip and it was also good and potent. Sharable apps start at $5 to $18 and specialty cocktails average about $14.  Sear Sucker was a great find in Vegas. Reasonably priced tasty food, well prepped strong cocktails and nice bartenders. Definitely a good spot to have dinner or pregame before a night of clubbing or gambling."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Get the shrimp and grits and you won't be sorry and I know I'm from the south and that was better than my mama's! Great service too."}
{"text":"Searsucker is getting  solid 4 stars because our waiter and the chef went above and beyond to make our experience top notch.  Food is unconventional and tasty and we had the added bonus of having the sous chef come by our table and provide suggestions on how to eat each of the small plates which were little delicious concoctions of flavor and texture.   Favorite - the marrow with fried Brussels sprouts - suggestion by chef."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We had an amazing waitress and I'm sad that I can't remember her name. She brought out complimentary cheddar puffers with jalapenos. I love my cheese, so this was off to a great start! She suggested that we try the 'Eggs & Bacon' which is a slice of brioche topped with the most succulent pork belly with a poached eggs glazed in hollandaise sauce. It was a life changing experience! MUST HAVE! We also had the bone marrow which was one of the best I've ever tried followed by the beef tartare. Can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can go to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick dinner while staying at Caesars and didn't really have set expectations for the food because the over the years various grab and go snack or burger joints have moved in and out of this space, but we were honestly pleasantly surprised by our experience.   The location is kind of tucked away so unless people are gambling in that area or do some research I feel like they probably aren't even aware that it is there. The interior has cool décor and lighting. The atmosphere is modern and inviting. And the vibe is come as you are and come hungry.  I did love that they had a Yelp check-in offer. I just started using Yelp a few months ago so I am always very excited when I find a new place that provides an offer with check-in and theirs did not disappoint! They brought me an entire bowl of Habanero and Coriander soaked pickles and as a pickle lover I was very pleased!   We decided to order multiple dishes and share them at the table.  Below is a breakdown of what we ordered:  -Biscuits with whipped butter and infused honey *Literally do not leave here without eating these and make sure to smother them in honey. SO good.  -Tomato and burrata in a mason jar *kind of a twist on caprese salad or bruschetta - very \"instagramable\" presentation and delicious.  -Field greens and pear salad with champagne vinegar goat cheese and candied walnuts *loved this salad and everything in it -- definitely recommend.  -Shrimp Scampi with spaghetti squash, garlic, and lemon *my mom and sister really enjoyed this. I am not a huge spaghetti squash fan so it wasn't my favorite.  -Slider trio with bacon, cheddar, chipotle, and crispy onions.  *my mom and sister are a little bit pickier when it comes to sauces and toppings so I was willing to eat the sliders sans chipotle and onions, but the staff were so accommodating that they brought the plate of 3 customized to our liking (1 with everything and 2 without). These were awesome so I can only imagine how delicious the full size burgers are!  Overall I would strongly recommend Searsucker as a break from the steakhouses and reservation only restaurants. The food is great, the service is awesome, and the environment is casual and relaxing. Don't forget to check in when you arrive!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Cutting Crew - Just Died in Your Arms Tonight) Oh I, I just ate at Searsuckers tonight It must have been something I read I just ate at Searsuckers tonight  I keep ordering for something I can't get Artichoke hearts lie all around me And I don't see an easy way to get out of this My cocktail sits on the bar side table The curtains are closed; the place is like an adult cradle Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this?  Oh I, I just ate at Searsuckers tonight It must have been something I read I just ate at Searsuckers tonight  Oh I, I just ate at Searsuckers tonight It must've been some kind of dish I should've walked away, I should've walked away  Searsucker is a hot new restaurant in S. Scottsdale.  I went to the original one in San Diego and thought it was okay.  The one in Scottsdale?  Well Okay at best again.    I think this place was over-hyped.  Granted they won a lot of awards, voted best new restaurant, etc.  I brought some friends from out of town here thinking I would treat them to a good meal and experience.  Needless to say, they weren't all about it either.  We ordered a bunch of small bites since we had a long night ahead of us eating and drinking; Kobe Carpaccio, Scallop Bacon, Egg Bacon Pork Belly, Meatballs, Squid sweet heat.  The Carpaccio was good, but nothing special.  Scallops with bacon....well everything tastes good with bacon right.  My favorite was the egg bacon and pork belly -- yummy, but belongs at breakfast.  The squid was sweet and spicy and that's about it.    The place itself is pretty swanky.  The ambience is hip and romantic.  Overall, I think it's a great place to hang with friends or bring a date.  However, gonna have to pass on the food part.  Maybe it was an off night.  Every dog has its day.  I really want to give this place a chance so me coming back is definitely.  Hopefully, this won't discourage you to go cause I would say try it on your own and let me know - wink! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid dinner spot. Drinks were strong, food was really good. The appetizers were tapas style which was a great way for our group to share some bites of everything we got. Main courses were great, I really enjoyed my side order of bacon brussel sprouts (something I never thought I would actually say regarding brussel sprouts).  Service was great, our waitress was really nice and polite. Menu is a bit pricey, but that is to be expected just about everywhere on the strip.  Overall, I'd come back for the food and service."}
{"text":"Visited Searsucker for dinner our last night in Vegas. Service was incredible and the food was savory! The atmosphere inside is super chic and relaxing. Great for small groups. We shared the NY Sirloin with a side of spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and paired perfectly with the spinach."}
{"text":"Went with a big group of coworkers for dinner. My half of the table shared about the entire small plates menu. Everything was great! My favorites were the veggie sides, Brussels sprouts were amazing! The snake in the grass drink was great. Funky but relaxing atmosphere, I felt like I was eating in an anthropologie store. Good service. Weird location in an office building. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Searsuck surely didn't suck for me.   Appetizer - Hummus and Grilled Flatbread: Three freshly baked, glistening flat breads that came with a small jar filled with house-made hummus. A perfect, light appetizer.   Entree - Jumbo Mexican Shrimp with Pear Ginger Chutney and a side of Roasted Mushroom & Herbs: When you order \"From the Grill,\" you select either a meat or seafood, then choose a sauce and side dish. The jumbo shrimp is legit, folks. Searsucker doesn't skimp on size and quantity.The shrimp pairs well with the chutney; although, I wish more was provided. As for the mushrooms, they were decent.   Dessert - Chocolate Trifecta: From the smoothness of the pudding, to the crunchy chocolate \"paper,\" I enjoyed most of the flavors and textures of this dessert. However, the cake was bland, but it might have been created intentionally to balance all the flavors. The other desserts on the menu might've done a better job in satisfying my sweet tooth.   FYI: The restaurant charges approximately 2 bucks per beverage refill -- I didn't think my Diet Pepsi was worth the extra cost; maybe another beverage would've. *shrugs*  Service: No complaints; great service.   Overall: Many of the menu offerings may not sound new and exciting, but Searsucker adds its own twist. To me, the food was fine, but I wouldn't order the same items."}
{"text":"Caesar our server was phenomenal! We had such a blast laughing with him and he kept the drinks full for sure! Dinner was on point, short rib was fantastic. Salmon was very very good. Hamachi in a jar and the tacos were delicious! The manager came by to check on us but it didn't seem like he was listening. Maybe Caesar should run this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really like this place.  The decor is super cool and the music is great.  The mussels appetizer was very good and the tongue in cheek main dish is excellent as well.  I had quite a few of their Indian Summer cocktails last weekend and they   were very refreshing."}
{"text":"It's barely been open for 6 months and is super easy to find! (right next to Omnia and the sportsbook)  but 5 Stars for HAPPY HOUR! It runs from 4:30pm-6:00pm Monday-Friday.  If you want to sample many of their dishes without paying the premium prices! I suggest stopping by for happy hour. Be wary, it's only in the bar area so if the hosts walks you over to the dining area, just let her know you're there for happy hour and drinks.  The menu has about a dozen items and it's significantly discounted! Food comes out \"shared\" style but to be honest, the portions are fairly large compared to other \"small plate\" or tapas style places.  We had the:  Farm Bird Lollipops - Chicken meatballs that are seared on a stick. You get three per order and they serve it over an arugala and bleu cheese salad!  Caesar Salad - MAN as a \"side salad\" this thing was HUGE. Only $6 well worth it.  Spicy Squid - Lightly battered squid in a hot and sour sauce. Pretty tasty, but I wish it was more crispy.   Short Rib - Super moist braised short rib over mashed potatoes. If you're buzzing and need something warm to sober you up, this dish will do the trick. $10 but portion size is fairly decent.  The cocktails and drinks are also discounted too. Most of them are under $7-$8 (marked down from $12-$16).   Service was great. Well worth it! We had all those dishes mentioned and 2 drinks each..came out to about $70. Definitely stop by if you're looking for a good experience!"}
{"text":"Best Oysters Ever!  We couldn't get enough.  We were headed to the Oyster Bar when we found this little gym.  We went three times in our three day stay!  The bartenders were great.  Heather and Michael big shout out!  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful bites of food. It's pricey but it's Vegas! The duck fat fries with the homemade ketchup were out of this world. Fries were so good they really didn't even need the ketchup! We also loved the swordfish dish and the braised pork butt was so beautifully tender. I recommend starting with the calamari \"steak\" appetizer. AMAZING"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see searsucker in Vegas. It's my favorite restaurant in San Diego so I dragged the hubby to this location. The bone marrow, mussels, and duck fat fries were excellent. See my photos. I love the crab cakes in the SD location but theirs are really salty. I had a hard time eating it."}
{"text":"Upscale casual dining in Cesar's Palace done right. The food is creative and tasteful. A successful play on most american dishes.   Chef Malarkey who gained instant pop status from ABC's \"The Taste\" and various Food Network stints wins hands down with this upscale concept restaurant.  Fans are truly won over - at least this one and his wife, mom & daughter too!  Our Day After Christmas ambiance was cheerful and lively but not too loud. Dine in the back of the restaurant for intimacy, front for people watching and a big bar with TV's. You can also watch the kitchen operate closely from some tables in the middle of the room.  Our servers Tammy & Mark were attentive, knowledgeable and gracious.  Prices are standard (for high end Vegas eateries) between $15-$30 a plate.  Must Have Appetizers: Tomatoes & Burrata with sourdough toast Fried Eggs & Ham Warm salad   Must Have Mains: Shrimp with Spaghetti Squash Short Ribs & Mashed Potatoes   Must Have Deserts: ALL  Tip: Make your rez (like we did) and eat before 7PM to fully enjoy without the \"packed & loud\" scenario trendy restaurants unfortunately adopt."}
{"text":"I was able to visit this place during lunch about two weeks ago. It is a nice spot and can be hard to find if you are not sure where you are going. They have free valet parking during lunch  hour which is great.  This place look great! It is like you are entering someone's farm type home with big tables with non-matching chairs (which I love!)  The lunch menu is slightly limited and you cannot order anything off the dinner menu ( we tried and were politely turned down lol) I cannot remember what everyone else ordered food wise but I do know that they loved drink which I believe was called the Indian Summer. (everyone that ordered one had two before the day was over ) I had the sweet tea vodka and lemonade which was delicious. The best Arnold Palmer I have ever had that's for sure.   For lunch I ordered the spinach salad and added the blackened salmon. I had to actually as for a new piece of salmon because it was way to salty to eat. Now before people get on my case, I have had blackened salmon before and this was by far saltiest I have ever had. They were gracious enough to remake it without salt and it was perfect.   Make sure to order some of those yummy fries because they were ADDICTIVE! Our entire table were practically fighting over the last few bites of fries. I swear my coworkers are crazy!  I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu as it appears to be tapas. Plus it would be cool as a cozy date night!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and while the meal was ok, I was underwhelmed over all. Service was super mediocre. Our server did the bare minimum and had no enthusiasm. We split: Cheddar Puffers: tasty, these were complimentary and packed a little heat that surprised me  Duck Fat Fries: ok, nothing to rave about  Caesar Salad: I wanted some greens so I knew this wouldn't be too exciting but I needed a salad. I asked for dressing on the side and the waiter said it is very lightly tossed in so I said ok, as long as it's light. It was drenched in dressing. Ugh  Short Rib: Best thing we ordered- delicious and very large portion  Squid: Our waiter recommended this and I thought it was awful. Hated the sweet and sour sauce and whatever they put on the side (tasted like cream cheese) made it worse. Just gross.  Manhattan Cocktail: My husband loved the Manhattans here- he can be pretty picky so I thought I'd make note of that :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went here and had a great time, great food, and great drinks.  She had the Fish & Chips and I had the Mussels.  The fish & chips presentation was really amazing and the broth from the mussels was so tasty.  I would have to say my favorite thing was the Old Fashioned that my wife suggested.  I've been looking for one ever since we got back.  I would love to stop by here again.  The service was great, very friendly.  Thank you all for a great experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it first opened. Ate there several times a week. Last time it looked  and tasted like cafeteria or airplane food.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place. Overall it is a good place to enjoy a decent meal. Nothing spectacular but defiantly worth mention as they did have some uniqueness  and the atmosphere was good. None of the dishes we had were out of this world, but they were good and worth bringing people for a quick bite to eat either before hitting the town or a late night snack as they are open late!  We tried the squid which was a in a sweat and sour sauce very good and full of flavor. Next the short rib was ok. It lacked a little flavor.  We moved on to the shrimp and grits. I think I had high expectations for that dish and it just was lacking a little bit of spice to make that hold statement. The tartar I could have done without, but the pork with the egg was defiantly unique and I think a must!  For dessert you can't go wrong with sunday. They kept on mentioning the cookies with Milk  so we had them and let me just say stick to the sunday!"}
{"text":"Everything was very good but nothing really blew me away. This may sound strange, but the food came out of the kitchen startlingly fast...almost as if they they didn't actually cook anything to order. The service was good and the decor was interesting."}
{"text":"I decided to try out their happy hour on Christmas eve and was pretty pleased.  The drinks were really good and the bar tender made sure to let me know the first one I wanted was not sweet and kind of strong.  Her service was really good and she checked in just the right amount of times. The fries were fantastic and everything a fry should be.  Crispy on the outside, nicely seasoned, and the sauce a compliment.  The fish tacos, however were not all that great and a little on the dry side.  They could have really done with a little sauce on them.  Still, I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Great menu, interesting pairings! I sat at the bar with friends, Phil was our bartender and was fantastic! Very attentive and made the atmosphere fun. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have you eaten at Seersucker in San Diego, My wife and I were very happy to see the new location in Scottsdale.  The location is a little funky, but the food  and the vibe are both great.  It's not quite as hip as the San Diego location, but it has its own Scottsdale flair.  (Although the bloody knife artwork is a little creepy)  We tried a variety of foods and found everything to be very good. That said nothing really stood out as above and beyond, hence only the four star review.  I think Seersucker is a great addition to Scottsdale it would highly recommend if you haven't been there you give it a try."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. The marketing is so cool and I've been waiting for the opportunity to come sample the cuisine. A friend invited us to join him to see Mariah Carey at Caesars, so this was that opportunity! I was so excited.  The Pros - The marketing is cool. - The place looks cool. - We were serviced by 3 different guys and they were all very helpful and attentive! - We all agreed that the calamari was the best item we had.  The Cons - Poor Selection. I wasn't crazy about the menu items so much so that I ended up getting a salad. Getting a salad at a place as nice as Searsuckers is like going to Basking Robins & getting vanilla ice cream. - Duck Fat Fries. GROSS. If I were a fast food character, I would be The Fry Guy. The aftertaste of the 'duck fat' was gross. Seriously gross. I barely touched the dish, and even told the waiter that, well, they were gross, but he said that he loves them & he left them on the bill. Shannon & Scot were in agreement about the grossness. - Expensive. I don't mind having a crazy expensive dinner, but I just wasn't expecting it here. The Cesears website has it listed as $$ and Yelp has it as $$$.  My Cobb salad with shrimp was $34. My martini was $14, but the Apple Martini listed on the menu was $35. Hmmm. All in, we spent $235 for 3 people. I had a salad & fries, Scot only had an appetizer, Shannon had a caesar salad and we all shared the calamari.  For the record, Shannon & Scot rated Searsucker higher than I did. There are several locations nationwide, so I must be in the minority of disfavor. Maybe you will like Searsucker more than I did."}
{"text":"First time here. Happy Hour menu is limited (food wise), but the tuna poke was delicious! We ordered the duck fat fries and a slider (chefs choice, tonight was pork belly). All in all the food was good and the drinks are strong. Service was good (we sat at the bar) and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! We decided to do a bunch of small plates. Disclaimer: these are not small plates! Definitely over ordered by 3 plates! They are a really decent size. My favorites were the short rib, the spicy shrimp and grits, and the beef tartare (with quail egg yum). I also had a cocktail called the czar and the ballerina. A blueberry/vodka/cucumber water/soda concoction. So good, not sweet, perfection."}
{"text":"First visit to Searsucker in Caesar's Palace and it was a good experience overall. The servers were very friendly and kept an eye on our table to make sure drinks stayed full. The place has an open cafe feel to it which was nice given its location next to the Sports Book.  The menu was interesting and had some interesting appetizers that I'd go back to try. This time I had the Bone Marrow and it was excellent. The table tried the salmon and skirt steak which looked good. I felt like a salad and asked them to finely chop and toss the Cobb salad and it was also very good.   All in all a good place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, delicious food and great service.  We came here as a party of four and all new to this restaurant. We were greeted by a warm and welcoming server who explained some of the dishes, cocktails and what she recommended.   We started with a few cocktails including the Peter Rabbit and Bad Bad T-Roy Brown. I loved the Rabbit... I added the gin to it and it made for an easy to drink refreshing cocktail that was a little sweeter so the alcohol didn't overwhelm you. Definitely a hit.  As for the food, we ordered the kale and romaine caesar, potato fries, JP's chicken wings, jalapeno-chorizo corn, brussels & walnuts and eggs and bacon.   My favorites were the potato fries, corn and brussels. The fries were so delicious fried in duck fat! They were crunchy, salty and had more flavor then a regular french fry because of the oil. The chipotle ketchup they are served with was also good fit and we asked for an extra serving of it. The brussel sprouts were roasted with a nice char on them and were tossed in lemon and walnuts. I loved the extra crunch from the walnuts and the tangy zest from the lemon. I could have eaten the whole dish by myself. I felt the same about the corn, spicy and sweet. It's a dish I wouldn't normally order but I am glad we did.   We also had the pb & J dessert and chocolate s'more dessert. I think they were both hits but the preferred the s'mores.   We had great service, the dishes all came out in a timely manner one or two at a time which I appreciated so we could take our time and our table wasn't packed to the brim with dishes. Thanks for the experience Searsucker!"}
{"text":"I have always loved every dining experience I've had at Searsucker whether it was the gaslamp, northern San Diego or Vegas location but this one in particular was my absolute favorite.   The food tasted more delicious somehow but could be courtesy of all the drinks I had which by the way, are incredible. I love spicy drinks and the jalaberry strawpeno was fantastic. We also got a bottle of wine and the Cabernet was probably one of the best I've ever had.   Appetizers:   Pork belly + egg: Get it. Don't even think about it. Just do it.   Mussels + chorizo: If you love mussels, you must get this. The small pieces of chorizo and sauce go so well together and the mussels are super soft.   Bone marrow: One of Searsuckers' rival (in my opinion) is Whiskenladle and I know their bone marrow dishes get compared all the time but honestly, they're totally different. Searsucker's bone marrow has some sweetness to it and the brussel sprouts that come with it tastes so good so don't skip it! It's not just decoration. Haha.   Entrees:  Tomahawk: If you are considering any of the red meat options, get this one. Let me say it again, GET THIS ONE. It's the most expensive thing on the menu but I promise it'll be the best ribeye you'll ever have. After the first bite, you won't even remember that it costs 85 dollars. And it's ENORMOUS. I always complain about 12 oz steaks being too small but our table of 3 meat loving girls couldn't finish it.   Filet + lobster sauce: This dish is great on its own but after having the tomahawk, it was really nothing special and that's saying something because it's delicious.   Brussel sprouts + walnuts: I don't even like brussel sprouts and thought this was SOOO good. So much flavor and doesn't taste like its a vegetable at all.   Deserts:   Smores bar: I'm not a huge fan of the smores combo but this one was different. Everything went together very well and the ice cream is amazing.   Milk + cookies: So simple yet SO good. They put sea salt on the cookies which enhanced the flavors and the cookies are so soft.   Now for the best part about our night, our server Chris was the best!!! How he managed to deal with 3 very exhausted but energetic and delirious dental sales girls is beyond me and I'm sure he is some part super human. He took such good care of us and really made our night super memorable. I would've given him a hug if it were appropriate to do that with your servers. Haha. If you could request to be sat in his section, I would definitely ask."}
{"text":"How great is this place?  We had a fun and memorable experience here the other night thanks to the servers and chefs!  No easy task with nine people (one of them my dad who ranks EVERY restaurant \"marginal at best.\" Lol)  Our personal favorites were the quinoa, short rib and chocolate chip cookies. But honestly, everything was delicious.  It's always fun when the staff enjoys being there, nothing is a problem and the meal just flows.  Love the vibe and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun trendy restaurant with great food. Smalls are appropriately named. Luis our busboy was really knowledgeable and friendly! Great place, we've already recommended it to our friends!"}
{"text":"I was on my annual trip to Las Vegas with the guys for the Super Bowl and made reservations to have dinner here on February 6, 2016.  Having become a foodie thanks to my wife, plus being a fan of Chef Brian Malarkey since his initial Top Chef contestant season I was excited to check out Searsucker.  Even with running a bit late, my friends and I were seated right away and greeted by our server Emily as well.  We ordered drinks and continued to review the menu to see what we wanted to eat.  I had the Big Eye Tuna with a side of Duck Fat Fries that was simply out of this world.  The tuna was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right with a nice shaved vegetable slaw to go with the dish.  The only thing that would have made the dish even more enjoyable for me was some wasabi to go along with it.  The duck fat fries were pretty tasty too as they had I believe pancetta bits and parmesan cheese sprinkled over them as well!  It was a different preparation than I have previously and enjoyable just the same.    One of my friends ordered the lollipop buffalo wings that were tasty as well and I was told that the blue cheese aioli was pretty awesome for the wings.  The other main courses that were ordered was the scallops and the filet steak.  Both of those entrees were just as delicious according to my friends.  The only way the experience would have been better is if Chef would have been at the restaurant and I would have been able to meet him in person!  I did Tweet to Chef on Twitter and he did like my tweet!!!  I hope to one day get to either of the locations in San Diego with my wife so that she is able to enjoy the incredible food!!!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at Searsucker in San Diego and decided we could enjoy a nice romantic dinner at the Las Vegas location.   We sat down and was greeted nearly 10 minutes after. First started with the specialty cocktail \"snake in the grass\" which was a over priced mint lemonade. I took a few sips and pushed it off to the side hoping our server would realize that I was unhappy with the specialty cocktail. My wife had the Malbec.   Started with the bone marrow which was actually the best part of our meal. For dinner we both ordered the NY Steak. Medium Rare for Me and Medium for my wife. I got the corn side dish and she had the asparagus.   The best part of our main course was the asparagus. $59 per steak? The $7.77 steak at Hard Rock  is far more superior than this over priced crap we were served. It was rubber and had no flavor. It was the hardest steak we've cut into. Our server asked how our meals were. I responded with, \"it's alright.\"  And that was the last time our server spoke to us until we asked for the check. We were clearly unsatisfied.  My specialty cocktail pushed to the side which was clearly full. Both our steaks barely eaten and pushed to the side. We asked for the check and he asked if we wanted to box it up. We said no. Not one question as to why we were unhappy with the meal.   Searsucker has failed with customer service and quality of dinner. Never again will we eat here. A kitchen nightmare. Thanks for ruining our lovely night."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal, at least our server was. I can not give 5 stars or even 4 stars because of the executive chef. Stephen Lasale (I believe that was the name on his jacket) was literally the most rude person I have ever encountered in a restaurant. Stephen, who was in charge of all of the food leaving the kitchen, was consistently just speaking in a derogatory demeanor to each of his fellow co workers. Our table was seated directly next to the kitchen so you could hear everything he would say and see all of his expressions as well as how his co workers responded to him. We did ask the server what his issue was and from what we gathered, this is very common with him. The manager came over to the table and did tell us that he agreed with us and that he would appreciate a complaint in writing. I think that no matter what position you are working, customer service is the most important thing ...whether it is internal or external. Stephen, I think it's time to find a different profession."}
{"text":"Beautiful setup. Great service. Amazing food.  Good price point. Nice menu selection.  Very accessible location."}
{"text":"Great service, food was amazing! Coming from San Diego we were delighted to see a familiar spot located in the heart of Vegas. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday night without reservation and were seated right away. Nice staff and service. Had steak, octopus, bone marrow, Brussels sprouts, and bread pudding with ice cream for dessert. All was delicious. Also duck fat fries. Pricey but normal by Vegas standards."}
{"text":"Wow this place is good. I am a carnivore. This is the perfect sort of place for someone like me. The service is great too."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour and burger. But, get here early because they only make 20 burgers a day!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?! Searsucker in Las Vegas, NV has become one of my favorite restaurants! Located inside the beautiful Caesars Palace, Searsucker knows how to satisfy every type of craving you may have. The restaurant has a rustic new aged feel with a little romance added in. The best part of course is the food!  With so many options to choose from, I love to order from the \"Smalls\" portion of the menu. These dishes come big enough for your appetite but small enough so you can order more than one.  Lets start with one of my favorite dishes, the Duck Fat Fries. Can you say Heaven? These will blow your mind. Crispy on the outside (but not burnt) and a taste that is very different than your normal french fries, this dish is guaranteed to make you want more!  Another mouthwatering dish you MUST try is the Brie \"Triple\", Cranberry Jam and Cowboy Caviar. The flavor from the jam compliments the brie in a way that I can't describe. You get sweet, you get cheese and you get crunchy all in one dish.  A must try while in Las Vegas, Searsucker will take you on a flavorful ride that you won't want to get off of. Let's give a big round of applause to Celebrity Chef Brian Malarkey for bringing us, in my opinion, one of the best restaurants Las Vegas has seen in a while.

{"text":"Food is so delicious!!! Can't go wrong no matter what you order! My boyfriend and I came for the first ti.e while in vegas and ordered the 8pz filet cooked to perfection and the sides we got were horseradish mash potatoes amazballs and the mac and cheese, all fabulous!! Our appetizers were the tacos and oysters, all so good!! So good we came back on our last night and tried there poke, Brussel sprouts, calamari and more oysters!! This place will definitely be a regular spot everything we visit vegas!! And we visit 1-2 times a year!"}
{"text":"Very cool vibe, fun drinks, and a great bar where you can people watch all the folks lining up for Omnia if you're there on a Saturday night. We had already eaten dinner when we stopped in for a round of drinks, but the menu looked really impressive. We ordered a round, and the drinks were not out of control expensive (It's Vegas, so I'm typically expecting about $15-$20 for a drink depending on which casino you're in)... I got a really nice glass of NZ sav blanc for $13, and the specialty cocktails ran about $15 a pop. Will definitely return the next time I'm at Ceasar's Palace."}
{"text":"Well....the much anticipated #BrunchUnplugged was finally visited by me last Saturday!  It's no secret I'm a regular at Searsucker/Scottsdale, and a fan. So I was anxious to get to their new weekend brunch.  Of course I like the atmosphere, and the service, but under the guidance of Chef Aarti Sanghavi, the food was AMAZING.  Chef was introduced to me by the GM and the was the start of my brunch adventure.  I asked her what was good on the menu and she stopped me and said, \"wait, what do you like? what do you not like?\"  \"forget the menu, I know my food and what you will like based on your tastes\"  So the beginning of a great hour of food was upon me. Chef Aarti was not kidding in the least!  She began with the waffles, no not your mama's waffles, but waffles from the gods!  or at least Chef Aarti!  Scrumptious describes them! OMG the fois gras butter....really?  Delish!  She then presented me with the 'Green Eggs and Ham\"  not quite what to expect, but the toasted brioche, pork belly, and poached egg were perfectly prepared!  Now the 'green' was a kitchen created chimichurri that absolutely made the dish perfect!!!!  As if that were not enough, next to the table was the 'chicken fried chicken'.  Yes a chicken breast filled with pork then deep fried and topped with Chef Arti's secret weapon gravy.  If I told you the recipe, she'd have to kill me!   I've not even touched on the bottomless Mimosa's either....! Let's not forget the live music that was energetic, soothing, but it did not interfere with the dining experience...yes LIVE MUSIC! You all owe it to yourselves to head to Scottsdale's Searsucker this weekend for their #BrunchUnplugged!!!"}
{"text":"Not the kind of place I would normally go, but we visited Searsucker recently for a yelp party and I was actually very impressed with the food and service. The bartenders know their job very well and the wine selection is very good.   This is definitely one of those high-priced upscale places, but if that is what you're looking for, Searsucker manages to be elegant but not snobby."}
{"text":"5 stars for our server who patiently explained all of the specials and his recommendations from the menu (he definitely knows his stuff) and plus divided up the bill however many ways we wanted.  He definitely worked for his tip!   As far as the food itself, I would give it a 4 star rating.  Got the sword fish, which came with a side of sauce - chose the chimichurri (per our waiter's recommendation- great job) and a side of Brussels and walnuts, which were tangy and yummy.    My husband ordered the pork butt (which I hear is actually pork shoulders), plus the side of duck fat fries.  The fries were good, but we didn't feel like they were anything super special.  The butt was big and had a lot of meat in them, and they were thick and juicy.  Hehe.   It all came out about 140$ including tax and tip , and 2 speciality cocktail drinks we gave our friends who were celebrating their birthdays there yesterday.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"Searsucker has a great Happy Hour special from 5-7 pm, with beers costing around $5. This restaurant is conveniently located inside the Caesars Palace.   The decor is beautiful and the food was pretty decent too. My hanger steak was cooked to medium rare perfection!   The service was really nice and they were quick. They refilled the drinks consistently and was very friendly!"}
{"text":"As foodies, we like to find interesting and new places to visit. After having been to Vegas a few times and exploring all types of restaurants, we came across Searsucker.  This was our favourite meal we've had in Vegas. The food was out of this world and definitely memorable.  Trust me when I say this... GO EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Brian Malarkey has joined the bandwagon of celebrity chefs and finally opened his own restaurant in Caesar's. Located right next to Omnia, the offerings aren't limited to seafood. Every Vegas restaurant has to offer steak and Searsucker is no different. But, I like some of the farm offerings as well including pork, chicken, and even rabbit. For Vegas standards, the entree prices are on par, but I see a lot of value in the small plates. We went with a large party for my friend's 30th birthday so we got to try a little bit of everything.   For starters, the cheddar puffers were as addictive as those crack cheddar biscuits from Red Lobster back in the day. Check-in on Yelp for a free serving of the habanero, coriander pickles. A word of warning, the pickles were delicious, but do NOT eat the habaneros (from experience). The roasted shishito peppers in ponzu were some of my favorites. The texture and flavor was almost like that of a shiitake mushroom. Of the small plates, the duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup was outstanding. The mussels were great too, but I didn't get much flavor from the beef tartare.   Seeing as Malarkey is known for seafood, I opted to get the mahi. The drunken cherries and smokey almonds outshined the actual fish. I could eat a whole bowl of just that sauce. The pork butt is another popular dish if you're not feeling the seafood. The desserts were great too and worth sampling. The \"ermahgerd\" sundae was delicious, but my favorite was the s'mores bar.   I would definitely come back for happy hour, which runs 4:30-6:00 pm. We ended up spending over $75 per person, which was pricey, but ended up getting us into Omnia for free to see Nicky Romero. You bypass the general admission line as well. Win!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing a show. Closes at 11pm on Wednesday. There's a free yelp check in for pickles and habanero. Yes, it's exactly as it sounds. WAY TOO SPICY for all us. Perfect if you love spice. To drink I got the when doves cry, which I guess is a homage to Prince. Drink was ok and so was service. Overall, place is just ok."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend, sat at the bar with zero wait. Bartenders name was Juice. Super knowledgable about all cocktails and the menu. Ended up getting a simple gin and tonic to drink. Ordered a few items from there small list. Hamachi was amazing but a little small, beef tartare was great and good size as well, muscles were huge portion and delicious. Over all great experience Juice gave us great suggestions and will definitely be returning to see him."}
{"text":"Good Food, fun appetizers, quick service and a delightful staff. We enjoyed cocktails and some apps before seeing a concert this weekend. The shrimp and grits were very tasty and had a nice kick to them, the complimentary cheeze puffs hit the spot and the waiter offered to give us to go cups for our cocktails. We were happy patrons! I would totally stop by again to eat a full meal the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The server we had tonight was super sweet didn't get her name she had bangs though !! Too bad the hostess are pretty rude and unwelcoming. I've been to there SD location as well and it wasn't all that great. Thought I'd give it a shot again in Vegas. Probably the last time I'll be visiting this chain of restaurants. Not much of anything special. Especially since there service is average."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup - SPOT ON.  This was a creamy tomato soup and the grilled cheese was gooey white cheddar on a fantastic sourdough.  The two were in perfect proportion - not too much of one or the other.  I'm a simple girl and this was probably my favorite dish.  5/5  Calamari - chili honey glaze and apples.  Very tender and tasty.  The flavors were good and it was one of the best calamari dishes I have ever tasted - the meat was not even the slightest bit rubbery.  The waiter recommended this and it did not disappoint. 5/5  Charred Octopus - ginger, sesame and sour orange.  I would not recommend this dish - when they say charred they mean very charred.  We couldn't even eat the terminal end of the tentacle because it was like eating a crunchy stick. 2/5.  Roasted Cauliflower - pickled chilis, pine nuts, citrus.  Cauliflower is pretty much the only vegetable that I like and this one was TERRIBLE. Flavorless and almost slimy.  Do not recommend. 1/5.   Bone Marrow - fresno chili bourbon glaze.  Compared to the other items on the menu the price point for this was excellent at only $15 (at most restaurants the bone marrow is significanlty more expensive than the rest of the menu). It was good but as always a small portion.  5/5.  Came here on a Friday night with my coworkers while at a conference.  We were seated at the booth nearest the entrance so it was open to the casino area.  I actually don't recommend that exact location even though the booth itself was comfy and the perfect size to accomodate lots of food dishes while still permitting conversation.  However, we didn't really enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant because we didn't get the lighting and music because we were so exposed to the walkway.  However, overall I very much enjoyed the dishes and drinks at this location, besides the few misses as listed above."}
{"text":"Overpriced and didn't let us know until it was time to pay they couldn't split the check up. Server had a poor attitude"}
{"text":"Came here for a group work dinner, the one in San Diego seemed to have better food. We ordered a little bit of everything and when asking the waitress how much to get and what to get she seemed to lack suggestions or portion size experience. Overall I'd might come back to this location, but I've eaten better in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is celebrity chef Brian Malarkey's foray into the Las Vegas food scene. The restaurant is divided into three sections and there's a bar area with eating/drinking overlooking the casino.   Four of us met for dinner and ordered a number of small plates, greens, and main courses.  We shared all items ordered and here's the list:  Egg and pork belly Short ribs Brie and cranberry jam Cowboy caviar Shrimp and grits Mushrooms and burrata Strawberry, champagne, walnut, and goat cheese salad Spinach, bacon, mushroom, and sweetbread salad Jalapeño-chorizo corn off the cob Pork butt with whiskey apples and bacon emulsion Duck with white bean, confit, and fig Brussels sprouts and walnuts Mahi \"baja\" with drunken cherries and smokey almonds Apple crostata Ermahgerd sundae S'mores Pumpkin cake  While waiting for all four to arrive, two of us were given a container of cheddar puffs and more were brought when we were all seated.  We discussed what each found interesting on the menu.  The head chef joined us and explained the entire menu and he gave us some suggestions.  The outstanding items were the egg and pork belly, cowboy caviar, the strawberry salad, pork butt, Brussels spouts, egg and pork belly, and the mahi.  Of those items, the mahi was the best thing of the night.  The char and the perfect grilling of the mahi made it an incredible dish.  The cowboy caviar, a.k.a. bull testicle, was tender and had a light breading before frying.    The pork belly was quite thick but was tender and cooked well.  I was surprised at how much I liked the strawberry frisée salad.  The champagne dressing with the walnuts and goat cheese was very refreshing and tasty!    The pork butt was done nicely so that it was pull apart goodness.  There was a discussion about the Brussels sprouts.  I was very fond of this dish and I found the crisp char on the sprouts to be just to my liking.  My only disappointment was the brie with cranberry jam.  The brie had lost all flavor and it really needed the jam to give the dish some taste.  I'd skip this one.  As for dessert, we agreed the S'mores topped the others.  The menu describes the dessert as Graham + salted caramel ganache + honey chocolate mousse + marshmallow + chocolate ice cream + cookie crumble.  The Ermahgerd sundae was also good.  It's described as Peanut butter gelato + peanut coffee \"rocks\" + caramel+brownies + brûléed banana.  The pumpkin cake and the apple crostata were also very good.  I think I could go back and have all five of the desserts but skip the 6th--cookies and milk--and I'd have had a memorable time!  Great ending to our feast!  Service was excellent.  Jeremy--our main server--came from the original Searsucker in San Diego and he was top notch in everything.  We were given clean share plates and utensils for each course.  Jeremy coursed our selections perfectly so we didn't get a whole lot at any one time.  Water was replenished often.  For a new place, they are really doing things well.  Plating was nicely done, the flavors are complex, and the textures are good.    I'll have to get back here if they put back on the menu the rabbit and wild boar chops that are listed online but have been removed from the printed restaurant menu."}
{"text":"Went with reservations for 7 of us ... Were seated promptly and our waiter Jeremy was a delight. He made several personal recommendations... and we were not disappointed... Loved loved loved this place... All the food we had was delicious! The poached egg and pork belly was amazing. I also had the loin filet with mushrooms and the Brussels with walnuts. Both were sooooo good. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. Best food I've had in a long time. I will definitely return when I'm in Vegas again... Think I might even try the one in San Diego now!"}
{"text":"We went here with my family before Absinthe! It was ahh-mazing.  The vibe of the place is a little nautical mixed with a little cabin woods.  I love the off white colors mixed with the accents of wood.  It was very relaxing yet vibrant- a perfect way to describe the food & the ambience.  Just go ahead and order the Jalaberry Strawpeno - You're welcome.   - If you love Calamari- you are required to try there Calamari Steaks. It will take you down a flavor road that you never knew existed.    - Lollipop wings are always a great idea at ANY of the Hakkasan Group restaurants.   - MAC & CHEESE - HOLY LORD ALMIGHTY........Just do it.   - Beer Braised Short Ribs so light and cooked to perfection.  The flavors on the short ribs will make you come back for more.   Thanks to the Searsucker staff for always doing a great job & answering all the recommendations. We will be back!"}
{"text":"before searsucker opened in scottsdale, i dined at the one in downtown san diego and absolutely loved it! when i heard we were going to be getting one here, i was thrilled. i could finally have my peter rabbits anytime i wanted them!  i've probably been to the scottsdale location 5-7 times, and have loved everything i've eaten so far. you absolutely have to try the squid-it's like nothing i've ever eaten before. the pieces are huge and the dipping sauce it comes with is so good. i recently had the tomahawk and couldn't believe how delicious it was-and massive!   i also can't say enough about the entire staff and their commitment to service.  a few months ago, a good friend was throwing a birthday party for her husband and the restaurant we were supposed to go to cancelled on her the day of!  she called me in a panic and i recommended we try searsucker to see if they could fit us in last minute on a saturday night.  they were able to accommodate our party of TEN with absolutely no problems and the restaurant was packed that night! everyone in our party loved the food, service, and atmosphere.  the staff was so attentive and my friend couldn't have been happier with my recommendation."}
{"text":"I was brought to this restaurant by a local and promised some delicious food, I didn't realize my expectations were going to exceeded. This place was fantastic from the warm inviting atmosphere to the amazing food. Emily made some suggestions as to what my table should order and share, she was spot on and we all loved the food. Take my advice, if you don't know what delicious item to order just ask the friendly staff. If you are lucky enough to get Emily as your server she may just warm you milk and cookies desert as well. Thanks guys for the lovely evening."}
{"text":"Incredible! I loved everything about my visit tonight...the ambiance was welcoming and upscale, the service was impeccable (our server Gianna was professional, attentive, and so sweet), and the food was amazing...I highly recommend Searsucker. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I remember the days when restaurants in Vegas were cheap so you would come in and gamble!  Now, not so much.  Food was average.  The bone marrow was really sweet, not savory.  Both our entrees (short rib and steak) were low on flavor.  The mac and cheese delivered but when doesn't it?  The cocktails were something I could have made at home. Service was very attentive.  Reservation was needed and they sat us on time."}
{"text":"You are sooooooooooooooo yummy! All the apps were amazing, but the entree was a thumbs down. This could have almost been 5 stars. Portions are pretty big and service was good. Also even though I made reservations, they sat us at these very high tables by the bar. I am having a family dinner and it got super loud. I think it would have been better by the kitchen on regular tables.   I picked this place because it's inside the Cesar's Palace right by the sports bar and we were going to watch Celine Dion (amazing show btw-a must see!)  Now for the food:  spicy hamachi & avocado, fresno chili / cilantro / oil-comes in a jar. Was't too spicy, but the hamachi was fresh and goes well with the wonton chips  beef tartare & sourdough,capers / mustard / egg yolk-also comes in a jar with wonton chips. Perfect amount of seasoning.   blistered shishito peppers ponzu / sea salt-something I just love to eat so I have to always order this if I see it on the menu. Thumbs up  bone marrow* fresno chili bourbon glaze-i'm not a fan of bone marrow because it is too fatty for me, but this was amazing! best dish of the night. The crispy brussel sprouts that it comes with gives it that nice texture. Spread the bone marrow on the bread, top it off with the sprouts and some cilantro and you have the best thing you've ever eaten!   mussels* chorizo / chili / cilantro / corona-they give alot. make sure you dip the mussels in the broth to give it that extra flavor  duck fat fries-crispy and delicious.    beer braised short ribs,horseradish potatoes / crispy onions-this was their signature dish and it was so disappointing. Lacked flavor, was dry, and we told the waitress. She did offer to make a new one, but we were so full and didn't want another one.   Stick with the appetizers only!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour.  Great happy hour menu and prices.  We got the strawberry, walnut and goat cheese salad - excellent.  We ordered the short ribs, shrimp and grits and crabcake.  All were great.  Great atmosphere and drinks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! A little on the pricey side but well worth it. We had reservations for 6pm and had no problems. We all tried a different cocktail. I got When Doves Cry; the tequila was strong but it was tasty. Friend got the ballerina & the czar; it was spritzy, pink and tasted great. For food we ordered the duck fat fries, short ribs, and my favorite item, egg + bacon!! It was sweet and salty, delicious. And then the cheddar puffers! Wow. Desserts were also on point. We ordered the smores, banana bread, and the pj and jelly puff! So much great food! Our server was excellent. So happy we made the trip down to the strip!"}
{"text":"After attending the Elite event at Seersucker, where everything was absolutely delicious, I knew that a return visit would be in the near future. So when Dyanna L. invited me to dine with her on a weekday evening I excitedly accepted.   Seersucker was rather empty when we arrived just a few minutes after our reservation, I chalk this up to happy hour having just ended. The service we received was excellent during this visit, attentive but never overbearing.   Dyanna and I shared all of the dishes we ordered, including the complementary cheddar puffers sent out by the chef. Here is a quick run-down of what we noshed on:  Brie appetizer - This dish featured made-in-house peach jam rather than the cranberry mentioned on the menu. So decadent, we joked that this could have been our dessert rather than our starter.   Cobb salad - We asked our server to help us pick between a couple of salads, and this was her recommendation. The bleu cheese, the roasted tomatoes, the bacon, the dressing...  everything melded together wonderfully.   Crab cake - The only item we ordered that we had during our previous visit. This crab cake has ruined all other crab cakes for me.   The Special for the evening - house made pasta with pesto, shrimp, mussels and a spicy tomato sauce. If this is ever an option on the menu or as a special, get it. The tomato sauce wasn't very spicy, you could taste the freshness of the pesto, and the pasta was cooked to perfection.   For dessert we had the lemon cheesecake, which was a lovely combination of tart and sweet.    After we ate we decided to stop for a drink in the bar area, where we were served by a bartender that was not only adorable but knowledgeable about the spirits. I ended up  having the Ballerina and the Czar, which the waitress warned would taste heavily of the cucumber water which was in it. I found it to be very refreshing.   Seersucker was a wonderful choice for our ladies night out, there was literally nothing that could have been improved upon during our visit. This will be my go-to spot the next time I have friends or family visiting that want good food in a somewhat casual setting on the Strip. I am also looking forward to taking advantage of the great happy hour prices in the very near future."}
{"text":"upscale, hip, trendy, and amazing food. Need I say more?  The enormous bar is a fantastic place to hang out before your table is ready. Get there early and have cocktails.   The food is very well prepared, elegantly presented, and can vary from simple to elegant. Don't be frustrated if you don't understand everything on the menu. It's meant to be 'interactive' so that the servers are encouraged to discuss the food with the clientele.  They have a pork dish with poached egg that must to tasted to be believed. Totally yummy!  Valet parking only; if there's self park, I can't figure out where."}
{"text":"My weekend dinner experiences with Searsucker have always been on point.  Although pricey and the service can get slow, Searsucker has always delivered on food.  Service 3.5/5 Their service is like Pizza. Even when it's bad, it's pretty good.  I've had some amazing experiences and other times where we had to find our server throughout the evening.  Everyone has always been consistently friendly with great vibes from previous visits.    Food 5/5  Everything I've tried at Searsucker has been a great experience.  Presentation and the quality of the dishes have always been top notch.  Here are some of my faves: Beef Tatare & Sour Dough: A Searsucker staple for me, the egg yolk brings this home   Tune Poke & Shaved Taro Root: Always fresh poke Lollipop wings: you heard that right, wings.  Their sauce is at another level, I'll order every time. Bone marrow: Just pure bliss and good times.  Highly recommended Beer Braised Short Ribs:  Ribs have always been tendered and very tasty. 36oz ribeye tomahawk: Fun to share, fun to eat and fun to share on social media  Value: 4/5  The Searsucker bill adds up quickly.  The \"Jars & Sliced\" dishes and sides are in the high teen price range and you're going to want to sample many.  Signature dishes and the grill stars around $30 and goes as high as $155 for the bomb 36oz ribeye tomahawk. The Signature dishes portions are very large.   Get ready to throw down some cash for a great and unique food experience  Ambiance: 4/5  It's a place to see and be seen when you dine here.  It's a very casual neo 1800s seersucker vibe with brick walls and lights hanging from ropes.  Every weekend dinner experience had people socializing at the table for long periods of time.  The dishes were designed to be shared so everyone is enjoying their food experience together.  This is a catalyst to socialize at the table, throw in some drinks (for us a lot) some music and you're having a great time quickly and the hours pass.    Expect to spend some money but bring your favorite foodie friends and/or drinking friends as you're going to be sitting down for awhile.  It's a great place to catch up over some great food in a loud but fun and social restaurant.  Expect to see some attractive people eating and pre-gaming before they hit up the Omnia nightclub next door.  I believe they still offer expedited entry (literally no wait) into Omnia if you spend a certain amount but verify with the restaurant.  It's the best and easiest way to get into Omnia if you don't have a host.   Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Try the Ballerina cocktail! Refreshing and delicious! Went in for a few drinks with friends and we were very impressed with the food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Omg! Me & My Husband went here for my Bday dinner we were walking around & we seen it,  looked like a bar? So we sat down very great customer service our waitress was awesome! !! Our food was more than amazing for appetizer we had spicy shrimp sauteed.  Then I had Salmon veggies side of mashed potatoes.  My Husband had the swordfish truly awesome here the chef made our food so good that everything we tasted after that point was nasty! So glad my birthday dinner was amazing! !!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here to watch the premiere of The Taste last night and were very surprised at how empty the place was.  We were also lucky enough to be invited to an event here last week in which were able to try a few of their signature drinks, some of their \"tastes\", and a couple of their dishes.  The food was phenominal, and I cant wait to come back and have a regular portion of it all. As for last night, it was just drinks for us.  This place is beautiful. Lots of warm light, interesting artwork (both on the walls and light fixtures), and dark wood. The kitchen is  open so if youre seated near it you can watch the chefs in action. Overall this place feels very warm and inviting. Not a bad place to spend an evening by any means.  Our bartender Zach was great. He answered every question we had about the food and their speciality cocktails. He even gave us a little tatse of a couple ingredients to make sure we'd like the actual drink. So far Ive tried the Peter Rabbit, Lt. Dan, Latin Cinema (all at last weeks event), the La Floridita (YUM), and the Pear Tree. All of them are unique and delicious, and Im sure Zach and the other fabulous bartenders here can steer you in the direction of which would be best for you.   Unfortunately, their happy hour is only an hour and a half long (5-6:30 M-F) but if youre able to make it down for it, they have some of their tastiest bites on that menu.  I highly recommend this place for any occasion."}
{"text":"A last minute find by someone in our group turned out to be a great experience all around!  We all guess that it'll be impossible to get in so quickly in the not so distant future.    Great small plates- anything pork is bound to please.  Lively atmosphere and very friendly and attentive staff.    You won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The bartenders and drinks were great.  The service at the bar was awesome.  I do know people sitting near the bar ca"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a large group recently, and while there was a lot to like, there were some issues as well. We were seated promptly upon arrival, and the space is definitely nice and comfortable. Drink orders were taken and delivered fairly promptly considering how busy the place was (Thursday evening dinner time).   After perusing the menu, we decided to get appetizers and spread them around; this netted us some tasty small plates. Among them, tender and flavorful lollipop wings, which featured a mild but distinct Buffalo style sauce with a delicious bleu cheese fondue for dipping. These were my go-to for the evening. Sliced calamari steak with chili honey glaze had a nice, thin breading giving way to a very tender and not at all rubbery interior; this dish was a major hit with the group. Another standout was the tuna poke and shaved tarot root; this featured a jar of deep red tuna poke with sesame seeds, onion, radish, and a little sriracha for heat, and was delicious on the crispy tarot chips. Unfortunately, an order of shishito peppers didn't make it to the table.  Things took a turn, though, when entrees were delivered. Me and another guest were sharing the bone-in New York strip, requested medium rare; it was delivered quite rare, well outside any notion of medium rare. This is difficult to forgive at this price point and service level. Upon letting our server know, she immediately requested a replacement from the kitchen, and while it was more properly cooked, it had also been pre-sliced, which seemed unusual to me. The flavor and seasoning were nice, but it put us a little out of step servicewise with our fellow guests.   Finally, we topped off the meal with a dessert that featured small ice cream cookie sandwiches; these were very good, with cookies that were fresh and decadent, and creamy ice cream that was very far from ordinary.   The service errors with the appetizer and steak, combined with cost, are what brings this review down. Other than the steak, the food items we received were very good, and I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Hungry on the Strip?...If you're at Caesars, stop here for a quick bite during HH.   Pros 1) We were able to get a seat in the bar area no problem during happy hour 2) Decor and ambiance were nice.  Bathrooms were clean 3) Our server was very prompt and friendly 4) Happy hour menu was decent... $9 bites from 5-7 daily.  $5 beers and $6 wines 5) Food was delicious! We had a few items from the happy hour menu and they arrived promptly and hot! Great quality and fresh!  Cons 1) Sliders only came with 2...They were too good to only get 2!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but it's unfortunate that I wouldn't recommend this restaurant based on how the hostess treated me and my family. She had long blonde hair and her name was Nikki.  When we requested a table she stated the restaurant wasn't opening until 4minutes. Two parties right after us was seated immediately. All the Caesar affiliated restaurants cater to diamond players and even let you skip the line. It's such a pity that this hostess didn't have any manners regardless of what customers we were.   In addition, the waitress asked the manager to come speak to us but that was non existent.  On side note our waitress Tammie"}
{"text":"Seersucker surpasses my expectations with a prefixed bachelor party meal.  The restaurant is located right next to Caesar's sports book.  The name implies Southern food, and I didn't see their normal menu although the food was actual culturally diverse.  Which I was good with as live in the South and didn't want southern food in Vegas.  We had two apps of hummus and himachi.  Both were decent.  The main course had options and I got something like skirt steak which was very good.  There were mashed potatoes and brusse sprouts to share.  I would have never visited just walking by, but I was pleased with my meal going in with less than high expectations."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  In general, I felt the food was over seasoned and that always makes me think the restaurant is compensating for poor quality.  The service was prompt but the staff had zero personality.  Crab cake app - good amount of lump crab but the cake was basically burned on the top and bottom; I liked the side of sauce and tabasco pearls.  Side of bacon grits - Gross. The grits were a horrible texture...like overcooked oatmeal.  I could have cut them with a knife!  Also way too salty.  Side of Jalapeño-chorizo corn off the cob - this was tasty but again was probably over spiced  Duck with white bean, confit, and fig - The meat was overcooked and incredibly  tough and the rest of the dish was bland.  I didn't even bother eating it.  It's Vegas, people.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great decor, open kitchen, service and reflection of their original San Diego flagship.   Their branzino fish & chips dish was fantastic, as were the frenched chicken lollipops, vegan Thai curry and octopus.   Excellent experience and a good addition to Caesar's."}
{"text":"We just got home from a trip to Vegas for my 35th Bday! We were there for 3 nights so we tried many restaurants. I would have to say this was a favorite. The mixed cocktails are a must!!!!! We actually left the restaurant from dinner and then went back for a 2nd round later in the evening! Yum!"}
{"text":"Located in Caesar's Palace, this amazing find rocked my socks off.   Ambiance: from chill at the bar (that has a ton of seating) to elegant dinner for two.  This place covers the spread and their Happy Hour specials are pretty cool too.   Service: excellent. I sat at the bar (party of one sadly) but the bar staff was a blast to chat with and quite knowledgeable about the menu.   Food: you MUST try the octopus ceviche! If you like octopus. The tuna poke also rocks my socks off but I'm partial to seafood ;) if you like habanero...you might want to try the habanero pickles! A bit of a bite but delicious.    No matter what you're hungry for this place has it. Steak, lobster, oysters, muddled, scallops, chicken, wings, fish tacos...the span of this menu is impressive and quite tasty.   If you're in Vegas and have some cash to spend...roll this way and check out Seasuckers!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and will have to give it another shot.  The suggestions for the Prosciutto Salad, Sweet Corn App and Kobe Carpaccio and the Bone Marrow were awesome.  We had a few of the infused cocktails and they were all super amazing as well.  The Old fashioned is totally a great taste!  Our bartenders Jillian (sp) and Roberto were formal, informative and gave some great suggestions.  The atmosphere is cowboy western motif meets modern art.  The portions are sized appropiately for the apps and to get something started but it is a bit on the pricier side.  I'll be back for entrees!  I love the concept for the bar and lounge and will totally come in for a late night snack or cocktail with a group of friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved every single second of being in this restaurant. The service was great, it was great décor and the food was delicious. Get the shrimp and grits, you will not regret it. Another can't miss is the brussell sprouts side, such awesome flavor. Searsucker also looks like an amazing place to have an event like a rehearsal dinner or a trendy special occasion restaurant. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I emailed both the address on the website and the Facebook page and got no response about our most recent visit.  I had dinner with my wife and her parents (in town from Cleveland) 2 Saturdays ago. It was my third trip to Searsucker and I have typically enjoyed the restaurant.  On this recent trip it was a little disappointing for two reasons. First, we made a reservation for 7:30pm and when we arrived we were told that things were running behind and would have to wait for 20 minutes. They suggested we wait at the bar, however, there were no spots available for us in either the bar or the lounge.  I understand that Searsucker is a popular place and I am glad that you guys are busy, it was just disappointing to be delayed when we made a reservation.  The next issue is a little more significant. My favorite dish on the menu is the chicken and waffles. I order this every time I am in the restaurant. On that Saturday night we order two of them (along with a slew of other appetizers) to share at the table. The waffles on both plates were burnt. I mentioned this to the waiter and he took them away. The surprising part is what happened next. He came back to the table and said that all of the waffles were like that. I asked how that could be and that is when I learned that the waffles are all premade earlier in the day.  I have never managed a kitchen and I understand that it is probably very challenging with workflow and time frames, however, a small waffle iron can turn out a waffle in 2-3 minutes. Also, it is extremely disappointing that the chef took a look at those waffles, saw that they were burnt and then still said that they were okay to serve to everyone that evening. Is there no quality control in the kitchen?  Looks like I will be finding a new favorite dish on the menu since the idea of premade waffles isn't that appetizing."}
{"text":"I'm a complete sucker for Searsucker!! Unbeknownst to me I've eaten at the Searsucker location in San Diego, but that experience failed in comparison to the one I had here in Vegas. Let me begin by saying the staff and their customer service was on point!! Shout out to Adrian and Phil who made our dinning experience at bar top absolutely awesome!! Every staff member we spoke with, whether they took an order, dropped off food, or simply checked on us was super friendly and pleasant. Kudos to the Hiring Manager.   Now for the scoop on the food...ahhh the delicious food. I tried three entirely different \"Smalls\" aka appetizers:   The calamari was a thicker cut, almost steak like, sans tentacles. I really appreciated how meaty and satisfying it was. If you're a calamari fan this is a must try.   My favorite dish of the night was the Mussels and Chorizo. Talk about mouth watering flavor. Thick cut cubes of chorizo marry perfectly with the fresh mussels to great the BEST tasting broth I have EVER eaten. I swear you could drink the broth as a soup.   The third app I devoured was the Mushrooms and Burrata on Texas Toast. As someone one who LOVES mushrooms and cheese this was my dream come true. Although it was a tasty dish, I was so obsessed with the mussels that it fell kinda flat it terms of flavor.   I decided to wet my whistle with their signature Ballerina and the Czar cocktail. It was light and refreshing. I think because it is mixed with cucumber water and because I chose to sip it slowly the ice melted which made the drink taste super watered downed, but my new friend Adrian added a splash of Sprite (per my request) which brought it back to life.   Overall it was a GREAT dinner/evening out. I will certainly be returning to sample more delicious dishes and to check out there pretty stellar Happy Hour menu!! You got me Searsucker and I'm not at all mad at you!!"}
{"text":"I really felt like a sucker because I couldn't find this place! Luckily, when I called the hostess, she was able to tell me how to get there. For anyone who doesn't know where it is, Searsucker is tucked between Neiman Marcus and a bank. The parking is kind if ridiculous, so park at the mall if you get a chance. It isn't a far walk and you might need a walk after all the delicious food you eat!   The front entrance is spectacular. It's a large wooden door that seems foreboding like great castle doors, but also beckoning like a siren calling you to your delicious doom. The inside is spacious and has some interesting décor. Ropes hang from the ceiling, like fishermen ropes entwined with the lights. Giant food related pictures hang (or are painted) on the walls. One is a large knife with ketchup (blood?) and another is a roasted chicken on a spit with a live chicken's head. (This one kind of disturbs me...) The bar is huge and wraparound style for easy access. The dining area has plenty of tables for an intimate gathering or a large one.   My husband really liked the spicy shrimp and bacon grits, while I really liked the squid \"sweet heat\" (calmari steak with sweet sauce). I also really enjoyed the Peter Rabbit cocktail. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I met a group of friends here and even though I knew from checking it out online that the menu didn't offer healthy or veg options, I went for the company.  Unfortunately, my group had a waiter who was in a really bad mood.  He inherited our table when our first server left, but then he neglected us and when we had two additional arrivals who wanted to order food, he acted extremely annoyed once we flagged him down.  We were shocked and slightly amused by our server's strange behavior (glaring at us one moment, then rolling his eyes or avoiding eye contact when he walked right past our table with his nose in the air while we were trying to get his attention), but it didn't help make a good first impression.  Finally, we flagged down the manager who apologized, brought our check, and told us our server was just really busy.    The interior is cool - nice blue water glasses and mix-matched furniture.  The menu isn't as creative as they think it is and the (first) waiter described the dishes with much more creative flare than they came out of the kitchen with.  Our table tried a little bit of everything and if you eat meat and heavy cream/sauce/oil, you might like this place's food.  I think one of the meat-eaters in my group of 7 was happy with her meal.  If you don't want your veggies fried and/or covered in cream your options are to eat lettuce or take apart a dish.  I ordered sautéed mushrooms upon the first server's recommendation, which were good, but I wouldn't go back for them, even if the company was good - there are too many other awesome restaurants.  Plus, the sangria wasn't very good (watered down red wine and sprite?) - it needs some kick."}
{"text":"Fancy place. Perfect for a nice date or a birthday dinner. Never packed, but still in a great area. Close to old town."}
{"text":"Jen, was amazing! She took care of all our needs l, remembered our names, and ensured our experience was next level"}
{"text":"Wandering around on our first night in Vegas during the July 4th holiday. We passed by this place and found it look interesting and decided to give it a try! We got a bone marrow plate and mussels. Food is a bit more on the greasy side. The most refreshing dish turned out to be the appetizer we got! spicy hamachi & avocado. SO. GOOD. and it's fun to eat too! Service was very fast and our waiter was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Good quality, little quantity.  I don't write many food reviews, but I felt I needed to for this place.  I attended a dinner party with ten plus people.  The ambience was great and the staff very friendly and helpful.  The menu is not only unique but really tempts one to try non-traditional plates, such as mountain oysters or tongue.    The reason for 3/5 stars is the quantity of the food provided.  It's really good and flavorful (I had beef loin), but the portions are small - so small that you leave hungry. (I am medium frame man).  I found myself eating a lot of bread to compensate.  For the price of an individual dinner plate, I can say I don't think the place is worth it.   I would not recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. But the food is not unlike TGI Fridays or Chili's. And even that wouldn't be a big deal but the kitchen couldn't manage to get food out at the same time. Not sure what the problem is but when you order appetizers and lunch and the order of delivery is: Lunch 1, then Lunch 2 five minutes later, and THEN the appetizer, something is going wrong. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Service here was terrible. Bartenders were incredibly rude and unresponsive. Asked for happy hour items and got a bill for normal priced items that the bartender claimed I ordered. No thanks."}
{"text":"Had the drunken skirt steak and duck fat fries. Both were delicious... the steak was cooked perfectly for medium rare and fries were just amazing. Went with a large group of friends and no one had any complaints about the deliciousness of the food. If you go be sure to ask for an omnia chip that admits one to the Express line for club omnia right next door."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check out the Searsucker in San Diego, but somehow ended up in the Scottsdale location first.  There were a few misses, but nothing major with the exception of the super salty salad.  It was a total disaster.  Here are a few other dishes we ordered:   Farm Bird Lollipops  Essentially meatballs with buffalo wing sauce.  The flavor and texture weren't bad, but a little boring.  I was expecting something more exotic with the name.  Salmon \"Scottish\"  Nicely cooked and seared, but the salmon was a little on the salty side.    Squid \"Sweet Heat\"  Probably the best calamari I ever had.  It was super tender.  The spicy sweet sauce gave a nice kick, but not overwhelming.   Even though the place was nearly empty, the atmosphere was welcoming with friendly staffs.  Some of the dishes were a little disappointing, but I am willing to give Searsucker a second chance in San Diego."}
{"text":"Tammie  One of my favorite experiences in Vegas... Let's start with the basics... Food - EXCELLENT Service - EXCELLENT  Value - GOOD Décor - Rustic/Sophisticated Hubby and I went in for Happy Hour (5-7pm daily). We arrived around 5:30 and found a table top by the bar. We started off with a Springtime Collins from the HH cocktail menu ($8). Very refreshing and a great start to our meal. We ordered a few items of the HH menu and regular menu (everything looked delicious, I would have ordered one of everything if I could have).  1/2 dozen oysters (reg. menu $3/ea), which happened to be from Washington, HH Tuna Tacos ($9), HH Shishito Peppers ($9), and the Bone Marrow (reg menu $19). Everything was tasty! I'm used to only seeing green shishito peppers but this order came with red and green, very colorful and well-seasoned. The bone marrow was excellent! Pure indulgence. Topped with crispy brussel sprout leaves and served with bruschetta toast to be devoured with the melty buttery marrow goodness. Highly recommend.   And then we have the dessert... WOW! First of all, everything on the dessert menu looks delicious, so you better save room. We ordered the s'mores bar served with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and I would have regretted it if we didn't. Perfect balance of marshmallow to silky honey chocolate mousse to chewy graham cracker base. I usually find many desserts too sweet and I couldn't keep my fork away from this thing. A must order.   And finally... the service, absolutely excellent. Our server Tammie (Tammy?)  was amazing. She knew everything on the menu, in detail, and had a great attitude. One of my favorite experiences in Vegas. Will be back on our next visit for sure.   P.S. I've been to their location in San Diego and it was just as amazing! Praying for a Seattle location!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a bite or dinner. The small plates are unique each with a twist and good portions. The cocktails are good as well."}
{"text":"I recently went to Vegas and Searsucker gave us the BEST meal! I still can't stop thinking about it.. drool. My friend and I split a few items: we started with the Field Greens & Pear Salad and added chicken, and it was almost like rotisserie chicken - super fresh and juicy. We also had the Shrimp Scampi (it comes with spaghetti squash) and Brussels & Walnuts. We felt like our items were super satisfying and generally healthy without being bland. Also not too overpriced compared to most places on the Strip! I'll be back! (*said in Arnold voice*)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars.   I was really excited to try Searsucker and then left feeling a little underwhelmed. First of all, the space is HUGE and was virtually empty when we went--which was pretty strange as the chef had won The Taste that very week. We ordered two cocktails and five small plates. The cocktails, though accompanied by stellar descriptions, were a bit flavorless (Snake in the Grass in particular). Some of the tastes on the small plates were GREAT (scallop with bacon and caramel...heavenly, duck fat fries--a great treat) but mostly I left wanting just a bit more."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, hands down. The hanger steak is to DIE for. Amazing atmosphere as well. Well done."}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding.  Not sure what some of the other reviewers are complaining about.  Probably picked on as a child and now they take it out on waiters and waitresses.  We were checked on by the manager multiple times and we even met Brian personally.  Everyone was very professional and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I had a great time here, but more importantly a very good meal and fabulous libations.  The most applicable description of the atmosphere is the cringe worthy cliché: rustic elegance.  Comfortably large but still maintaining intimacy, with loungey leather sofas in the entry, large distressed wooden dining tables, and large, statement-making crystal and rope chandeliers hanging from the high ceilings. I dined here with a bunch of raucous early 30-year olds for girl's night out, and Searsucker definitely proved an excellent choice for such an occasion.  I was happy to encounter a diverse age group of sharply dressed folks ranging from 20-60 during dinner.  It should be noted that once 10pm comes around, a DJ emerges, the atmosphere takes a fun switch to a nightclub vibe, and the mean age definitively shrinks. The food was very good.  The menu leans itself to mostly small plates, which is a good thing because the dishes are exceptionally rich (think Rokerij).  We tried a bit of everything, and everything was indeed a hit with the ladies.  The drinks are not cheap, but well-prepared and worth the outlay.  These delicious cocktails might lean a bit on the girly side, but gentlemen fear-not: their beer selection is robust."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Searsucker in San Diego so it was a treat to see it pop up in Las Vegas - started with 3 rounds of the addictive cheddar puffers, loved the ponzu shishito peppers and was really happy with the spicy tuna tartar"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled in here through our adventured on the strip, and across the board we were all very pleased. The beef tartar was absolutely delicious and the free habanero pickles that we received from checking in with yelp were great too. For our dinners my friends ordered the beer braised short ribs which came with fantastic mashed potatoes,  the braised pork butt, a few salads and I personally ordered the Seersucker burger. The burger was one of the best of recent memory for sure, a little salty but over all delicious. If you are looking for a place to grab a bite, check them out."}
{"text":"restaurant is now open in Scottsdale. The first Searsucker restaurant opened in 2010 in San Diego by Bravo's Top Chef, Brian Malarkey, and Brian has recently opened a Searsucker in Scottsdale as well.  Located on the northwest corner of Camelback and Goldwater, Searsucker has taken over a 9,500 square foot space inside an office building. Large, inviting, rustic, yet classy is how I would describe the decor upon first entering. Large planks of rustic wood cover the windows and walls, the high ceilings with lights draped in thick rope offer the perfect dim lighting, and the rustic style wood tables lend a boat-like appeal, while a few couches and chairs fill the middle of the space lending a loungy area as well. The square bar near the front has plenty of space to enjoy hand-crafted cocktails and food, while the dining room seats approximately 150. The music is fun and upbeat which keeps the mood high as well. And the service that evening couldn't have been more attentive, friendly or helpful.  On to the menu! Executive Chef Malarkey's menu is both serious and fun, with dishes divided into categories like, 'Bites,' 'Greens,' 'Ocean,' 'Ranch,' 'Farm' and 'Ands'. The waiter first delivered our bread to the table, which they call cheddar puffers. These delectable little balls of joy were similar to the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster (c'mon, who doesn't know about and love those), only these were pumped up on steroids a bit. Yum! Then, sticking to my usual regime of ordering as much food to taste as possible, I always must try the mussels whenever on a menu. These mussels were served with chorizo and toast ($12). The chorizo added a nice flavor in every bite. Next, the egg and bacon \"pork belly\" small plate ($12). This is the kind of dish that you might make inappropriate faces while eating, it's that good. We also tried a tuna tartar that night as well, served with wonton chips ($12). And of course, we had to order a dessert as well, which included peanut butter ice cream, nuts and caramel. Um, HELLOOOOO! Delicious.  Offering a full bar and a decent wine menu, this is not only a great place to start for happy hour, but a fun place to dine with friends or a date."}
{"text":"This is a solid new restaurant.  The bar tenders are really nice.  Of course I stopped here during restaurant week and the menu was great.  For $40 I started with one of the most beautiful salads I had even eaten.  It had a puddle of what could only be described as goat cheese loveliness spread on the bottom of my plate.  Then there was a generous topping of assorted lettuces, plus lots of strawberries topped with balsamic.  It was so nice.  I then had the flat iron steak which was real decent, but the star of that was the chimmichuri.  I may not have spelled that correctly, but you know what I mean.  The end of the meal was AMAZING as I had the cookies and milk.  So delicious.  There were three cookies and they were chocolately amazingness with just a quick sprinkle of sea salt on top.  I have decided that if I ever make chocolate chip cookies, I am sprinkling sea salt on top.  Now, mind you, I already do this with my peanut butter cookies, but who knew salt would be equally delicious on chocolate chip cookies??  A quick note, I find the dining area to be EXCEEDINGLY loud as there are bare floors and lots of people squished into a small spot.  The music was awesome though, even if it added to it's loudness ;)"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Caesars Palace Casino, we stopped here for a small dinner and it was perfect. I had the duck fat fries and Brussels and my husband, at the recommendation of the server, Ordered the scallops. Scallops were tender and the creamy sauce was delicate. The Brussels sprouts were roasted in a wonderful sauce, I could've done with the walnuts. And the fries were an enormous order of fries, perfect with Parmesan and bbq sauce! Their Mai Tai (don't judge, I was on vacation) was a unique recipe including lime juice and almond syrup! Loved it. Only took off one star for the server that was very overwhelmed and the place seemed severely understaffed for the night. He did great with the recommendations though."}
{"text":"Food and service are both excellent. Came here for happy hour had the shrimp and grits crab cakes and Caesar salad. Plenty of food for 2 people. HH has good selection of food not just bar bites. Drinks for HH have plenty to choose from not limited to well drinks and crappy beer. Service was great attentive without hovering food cam out very quick. Good amount of seating options for HH will definitely be bringing friends and out of towners."}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited during happy hour a few weeks ago and had a fun time! All of the food on the happy hour menu is nine dollars. Personally, I think this is a little on the expensive side, so I went in with higher expectations. All in all, things were just fine.   Duck Fat Fries - 2/5 Perfectly fine fries. But I couldn't taste the duck fat at all.   Blackened Tuna Tacos - 4/5 I'm not usually a fish fan, but I actually loved them! Hubby, who ordered it thought they were only ok.  Mac N Cheese - 3/5 This isn't on the Happy Hour menu and was $18. The portion is definitely large enough to share and considering what else we'd ordered we couldn't finish it all. However, it wasn't $18 exciting. I could've used even more Cheese and I don't think I saw a trace of bacon the menu claims.   Another HH menu item that someone near us ordered were the sliders and those looked pretty good. Maybe we should've tried those.    The good thing is the service was attentive and friendly and the decor is super cool. Depending on what you want, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Originally it was a review in Seven magazine that sparked my interest in this spot, so I decided to check it out myself to see if it lived up to the hype. It met every expectation and more!   We were 20 minutes late for our reservation but called ahead to let them know and were seated right away (this could have been attributed to the fact that it was a relaxed Sunday night and wasn't super busy). The menus were pretty simple in that they didn't necessarily list all the ingredients in each dish. This was done to invoke questions and a more interactive experience, according to the server. Our server, Alyssa, was incredibly knowledgable and accurate in her descriptions of the menu items, and after much deliberation, we decided on:  -Duck fat fries with prosciutto bits (an absolute must- very flavorful) -Cowboy caviar (Rocky Mountain oysters with toasted kale and sweet potato with a balsamic drizzle- my favorite part of the meal!) -Pork butt with whiskey apples (melt in your mouth goodness) -Warm toffee pumpkin pudding cake (we didn't think we would have enough room for dessert but we're glad we ordered it!)  The dishes were as simplistic in their delivery as the menu had been, yet were still presented beautifully on each plate. This is not a restaurant that makes you question your knowledge of which fork to use- rather, it's a relaxed, inviting atmosphere where the servers are as unpretentious as the dishes themselves. Each bite was delicious, and the overall experience left you feeling happy and fulfilled. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally had a chance to get here for dinner with one of my girlfriends. The location is kind of a pain to get to if you're a local and parking in Caesars self park. Be prepared for a long walk. Luckily the wait times were reasonable and the ambiance is sort of trendy and fun.   Now on to the stuff that really matters, the food. We opted to try some shareable items to get the most out of our stomachs. To start we had the beef tartare. Amazing! If I had to recommend any one item here it'd be that! The other food was good, but not in comparison to the tartare.   For dessert we got the milk and cookies which was warm and fresh just like mom would make them. I did wish this was a bit more shareable maybe with two milk glasses instead of just one but that's just me being picky.  I definitely want to come back again soon and try more of the shareable options. I noticed they also do birthday songs & dessert which is nice for birthday party groups."}
{"text":"Love the interior of this restaurant. Gorgeous. I've been to the Las Vegas location twice now and really enjoy it. Also been to the San Diego one.  It's a shame I have never had room for dessert here  last night, I got the ahi tuna. Delicious. Wrapped in prosciutto and had a delicious sauce. The tuna was melt in your mouth good."}
{"text":"We went to Searsucker with a couple of friends of ours and were really impressed by the decor and with Les, the GM. He was extremely nice and was definitely a service-minded host.  We tried and compared a bunch of different dishes, so I'll provide a little overview. Overall, the food was excellent. I definitely have a taste for some things over others, but everything was quality in its presentation.  Cheddar puffers = Mind-blowingly good. \"Cowboy caviar\" = I don't care what you think. I was also blown away by these. They taste like dark-meat chicken. Buttery rich. Marrow bone = A lot better than I expected. Would have no issue eating this again. Mussels = Very good, and I say that not being a seafood guy. Beef tartare = First time ever trying this. The meat was delicious. The accessories (quail egg, taro chips, etc.) didn't do a lot for me. Hanger \"butcher's steak\" = I ordered this for myself and after sampling the dishes of everyone else in our group, we all thought mine was the best. Excellent steak all around. Mahi = Not enough flavor, in my opinion. It tasted like your typical sea fish. Salmon = Far from the best salmon I've had. Didn't quite seem tender or flavored enough. Duck = Not sure what I was supposed to expect, but it was pretty rubbery. Fried brussels & walnuts = solid. Nothing extraordinary. Cauliflower = absolutely delicious. Would definitely get this again next time. Doughnuts & chocolate = very tasty. Probably would order differently next time, since I'm not big on dark chocolate sauce, but still good."}
{"text":"Just writing for happy hour.    This was kind of a giggle, my friends and I like to call this our Cheers bar.  You know, where everybody knows your name...lol, see what I did there?  Happy hour is from 400pm to 630pm, everyday.  The happy hour menu is pretty awesome because it includes your usual wells, wines, but for me, what I love is that they have different draft beers on special.  I'm talking $5 drafts on special.  On the Las Vegas strip, that is almost unheard of!  As far as happy hour menu, they have about ten items on special.  My go to is Shishito peppers and duck fat fries.  They just recently changed up the menu and added a few more items.  Last night I tried the pork chips.  It was okay, perfect for when your drinking and the right size portion for complimenting your beer.  For me, too sweet on the pork, but I guess that's to balance the saltiness of the chips.  Staff, always friendly and quick with service.  Service with a smile! Searsucker is awesome!"}
{"text":"So overpriced, but what was I expecting?! My girlfriends and I came here because an Omnia promoter told us that we can skip the Calvin Harris line if we ate here. There's an Omnia package on the menu if you eat $75/per person where you can expedite the lines. We opted OUT of that option and just ended up snacking here.  First of all, the shareable appetizers are not shareable. How am I suppose to split ceviche with someone when it comes on one tostada? R u dumb. Skip the beef tartar, skip the $20 crab cake, and just get a bunch of the mussels. Super tasty mussels with andouille sausage. That's the only thing I would come back here for."}
{"text":"Underwhelming, to say the least.  My hubby got 3 oyster shooters and all them had shells in them, not just a few shells (this is expected) but a mouth full of shells.  My wine had something floating in it and the happy hour sliders were so disappointing. The saving grace was the bartender, she was super sweet and genuinely concerned about our visit. All in all, save your money and move on if you're looking for delicious food."}
{"text":"One of, if not the best, burger I have ever eaten. They say they only make 20 each day. Very happy I took advantage.  Great drinks too!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to Searsucker since the Yelp event in January but when deciding on a location to have dinner with a group of my girlfriends on the night of my birthday it was my top choice. They have some amazing deals for Happy Hour (until 6:30) so those who got there early enjoyed some drinks and apps at the bar. I had a Peter Rabbit which was delicious as always and the other two ladies tried the berry vodka martini (they infuse the vodka in house) and a hibiscus rum daiquiri (refreshing but a bit tart). To eat, we ordered the hush puppies which were a tad too sweet for my taste but pretty delicious as well as the farm bird lollipops which were like hot wings but in meatball form (on a stick); I loved those. Both plates of food were gone right away so we also got some beer nuts to munch on while we waited for the others. Those are pretty darn good for only $2. I did end up also trying the cinnamon mule - I wouldn't recommend this drink unless you REALLY like cinnamon. Just stick with Peter.  Once everyone had arrived and we were seated for dinner the real feast began. Everyone at the table either ordered salads or else small plates to share. My absolute favorite was the squid. That was totally fantastic! It was cooked perfectly with just the right texture and the flavor of the seasoning used was amazing. I also sampled the shrimp and grits, fried brussel sprouts, and corn off the cob. All of them were delectable. Really fantastic food! We ordered the brie triple as well which is supposed to be served with orange and fennel. That sounded quite interesting but instead arrived drenched in hot strawberry jam. No explanation was given but that is not a surprise since our waitress seemed entirely unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer any questions about the food. The service in general that night was pretty disappointing. We had to wait too long for drinks to arrive and then there was a weird issue where the busser started clearing away all the dishes before we had even finished and then placed all new silverware in front of everyone even though we were done eating. I don't know what that was about but I really can't stand off timing. All was forgiven, however, when the waitstaff brought out a free chocolate dessert with a candle in it for me and also a round of champagne on the house for all of us!"}
{"text":"My experience here was so odd and disappointing.  I was intrigued by the menu and good reviews on Yelp, so stopped in this evening for dinner.  We attempted to have a drink at the bar, but were told for 20 minutes that a waitress would come over and no one came. Whatever, still stayed strong and waited for our table.  We never actually met our waitress, but had the manager wait on us.  He was funny at first, until he basically lied and sold us sides like a dirty used car salesman.  He told us that the potatoes with the short rib and the corn with the scallops was minuscule.  He legit said it was 2 small slices of potato and that we needed to order 3 sides.  Because I didn't think we were at a seedy upwelling restaurant, we trusted him and were incredibly surprised when we received our huge meals (large helping of potatoes, not 2 slices) with no need for 3 $18 sides.  The sides were disappointing and in no way worth the price.  The Mac and cheese was apparently \"the best on the strip\" and stuffers tastes better.  The food was good, but I cannot get past the unprofessionalism of this establishment.  I felt uncomfortable when he came back to check on us, I told him I was disappointed that he misled us and he just laughed it off and we were later presented with our $350 bill."}
{"text":"We selected Searsucker for a large group dinner and were impressed with the service (they accommodated a last-minute party-size change with a smile), ambiance (cool, but not loud), and food (delicious all around). This is a great option for dinner, especially with a bigger party."}
{"text":"I love Vegas so much  I visit every few months.  Being a foodie, next to NY or ChiTown, Vegas is the next best thing to finding great food.  Yes everything is glamorized and every casino restaurant has a celebrity chef's name attached to it.  I only know Brian Malarkey from The Taste show.  His take on food is creative, yet comforting and not too out there.  Simple well known flavors that are combined and work well.  We only had three different dishes and all were delicious and tasty.  Brie Triple + Strawberry Jam - Not sure what the \"triple\" means, but you get three crostinin's, a nice size cut of brie topped with jam to even out the flavor and thickness of the brie.  Good starter!  Egg + Bacon (pork belly) -  This a similar take on eggs benedict.  You have a nice toasted piece of bread, layered with slow cooked tender juicy pork belly and topped with a poached egg and gravy.  Every bite was savory and sumptuous.  For our main entree we both had the Loin Filet (yah we are adventurous).  I guess these new age chefs dont like to call it filet mignon any more, but in essence thats what it was.  It was flavorful, tender and a good sized serving for $40.  The lobster butter and mushroom demi gave it that punch it needed to not make it the boring filet mignon served at your favorite steakhouse.  Service was quick and pleasant, but we didnt have the connection with our servers you can feel when they really enjoy their job.    I liked that it was casual and not stuffy, high end.  Nice addition to the vegas scene."}
{"text":"Terrible.. just to say that the toast was BLACK.. and food just overcooked.. terrible experience"}
{"text":"The ambiance & food is perfection. We had a view of the kitchen & a clear view of the tv to watch the game. What more can I say than this is THE SPOT. My table had the short rib, mussels, shrimp ceviche, bavette flank, bone marrow, & lion \"filet\". Not a single frown at this table! Everything was delicious!! Our server was very knowledgeable & so was his assistant. Oh & I can't forget, a round of applause for their dessert menu. We each got one item..BOY! Was this the cherry on top to our experience. Make your reservations because I can see business booming for this hot spot!"}
{"text":"I like this spot, it has a good happy hour considering where you are, but it does last until 7 pm which is great for a happy hour. The other Caesar Palace lounges tend to end at 6 pm if they even have one to begin with. I wish they had more vegetarian options on their menu is my only complaint but who wants to go there for food anyway..."}
{"text":"Funky menu but one of the only late night options at Ceasar's.  We had the steak tartare which is very good with a raw egg- but not Paris good.  Not too filling either- probably good have doubled the portion.  Service was good but somewhat distracted.  Would I go back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Restaurant or competition for the Gap?  One can't really tell by the name.   Slaughter House? Maybe...  Animal Farm-esque animals greet you at the entrance way, yelling, 'EAT!' They are painted in garishly bold colors.  As I walked passed the pig, I was afraid of an uprising.  Walking in the door to this posh restaurant, my suspicions were confirmed.  The decor, while clean and expensive, looks one dimensional on first glance.  As I sat and looked closer, the sweeney todd atmosphere encroached.   The red soaked accent wall by the kitchen stands out as if it were masking the excess blood coming from the fresh meat.  The rope hanging from the lights, posing as lassos, look  morbid and give an eerie feeling of a noose. And the giant painting of the gun handle fork, piercing through a piece of meat, with blood posing as ketchup rains down, definitely turned me off of meat for the night.    I am not a vegetarian but with the fear of an animal take over, I tried to stick to fish and veggies.   We were met by a friendly waiter with a searsucker apron. The service was good and friendly.  The food offered a lot of variety and was described as a collection of American specialties with shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, scallops, burgers and other various meats.  It may be that I am a bad orderer, but my selections were not something I would go back for. The scallops were wonderful, the donuts were melt in your mouth good, and the duck fat fries were on par. The shrimp and grits were heartburn inducing and the cobb salad had too much going on leaving me unable to fully taste all the flavors or it just lacked a good dressing.   My companions enjoyed their meal and would venture back. I live in Belgium and will stick to my mussels and frites."}
{"text":"Food was amazing & infusion cocktails were unique & wife wanted to try them all.. Parking was a but awkward but I think that was cause of construction..   For opening night the service & food were amazing only can imagine it getting better..   We will be back.. Maybe this weekend!"}
{"text":"Good food. Super, super, super slow service. Drinks and food were expensive (very overpriced) but that was expected because it's Vegas. Not sure if I'd come back or not but it was a good time.     P.s if you are with a bridal party and bring your own cake there is a thirty dollar charge."}
{"text":"The first time I came to visit this venue - I was surprised at how quiet it was. There wasn't a lot of traffic at this time. The service was professional - from the time my friend and I sat down until we closed out we were treated as if we were at a 5 star steakhouse. I ordered the Achilles Peel to start - although the drink was more potent than I thought I could still taste the sweet flavor or mixed berry. For an appetizer my friend and I started with an order of crab cakes. The order was smaller than we though and tasted salty - although the garnish on top of the crab cake helped take down our sodium levels. For my entree - I ordered the filet which was super tender and very easy to cut. I wasn't a fan of the sauce that was on top of the filet but the mushroom sauce on the bottom helped with the flavor. For dessert - we ordered the banana bread pudding which was sweet but still crunchy. The server was thoughtful and put Happy Birthday near the bottom of the banana bread. Our overall experience at Searsucker was okay but I would definitely try the place again. It's nice to feel like a VIP on your birthday."}
{"text":"This place comes with a great reputation so it saddens me to have to say anything negative. First I will start with the positive; the food! It really is divine! I had the salmon with Brussels Sprouts and my son had the Filet. Delicious and served in a timely manner. Now for the 'dislike' ...we ate at the bar (it's what I do and what I like) the bar wasn't too busy when we were there..4 guys behind the bar; 2 in the plaid shirts and 2 in the #teammalarkey black tshirts. Appetizer came and no silverware or napkins were delivered. Asked for both, silverware came but no napkins. Asked for napkins and the guy said 'let me go get them we are out of them behind bar' 10 minutes later (I have since grabbed the square drink napkins) we ask a different bartender for napkins...which he walks over behind bar and gets them for us. Other guy had forgotten ..(remember this bar wasn't super packed) Now on to the meal arriving; my son asked for pepper, bartender (same forgetful one) brings us s&p and says 'the pepper is empty let me get more' 10 minutes later and most of our food is consumed we flag a different bartender about the 'empty pepper' he checks it (we didn't since other guy declared it empty) and had a little in it. So at that point we tell the guy what has been happening. He was nice and apologetic. I have to say I am not a complainer but I was shocked at this one certain bartender...too forgetful when people are sitting right in front of you. I haven't had bar service this frustrating in quite awhile. If I had only been drinking I suppose it wouldn't have been noticed. But let's face it, a lot of people eat at the bar and even more so when a happy hour is going on. Again...the food was great and the decor is very neat as well! It is a lot like the one in San Diego which I have eaten at several times and had drinks at often! Never disappointed at that one even at their busiest. I am still giving 4 stars for this review because I can't let one bartender take away from the fact that the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place. Loved the decor and the drinking cups it's a mixture of classy, relaxed and country not sure how to explain it. The service was good the food was awesome although the shareable tacos were incredibly small. Great dinner menu and not mad prices, located inside the Caesars palace which is great if you're thinking of going to omnia or Fat Tuesday after dinner. Bar was really good and the service was friendly I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Duck fat fries were really good. Grilled cheese and tomato soup was OK. The grilled cheese was good, bread was kinda thick though, the tomato soup was not.  I was really craving a burger and they let me order one even though it  wasn't on the dinner menu...I'm glad they did bc it was a tasty burger!  My husband got the short rib app and mussels. I got to try those as well. Both were done well and very good.  For dessert we opted for the sundae.  Service was great and we had a nice dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good overall. I had some good drinks, my wife had a good drink and one bad drink, and the food was pretty good. Overall for the price, it was a pretty good deal for a restaurant at Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Right next to omnia, if you eat here you get Into the club for free. Ordered the pork belly, chicken lollipop wings and short rib. The wings and short rib stole the show!!!! So delicious."}
{"text":"First time diner. Nothing to complain about really. They had a peanut butter and jelly old fashion which was delicious, but everything else we ordered was pretty mediocre.  We asked for our steak sliced and it came cut in half, which I thought was odd but not a big deal.  From what I believe was a manager, came by and dropped off one of our drinks. Didn't say a word just put it on the table smiled and walked away. Which we both thought was a little weird.  And it was extremely loud.  Nothing really stood out, just another spot.  Probably won't return by choice"}
{"text":"Definitely returning to this location- best service we received on this trip to Vegas.   Extensive cocktail list, very unique drink options. Our server Chris (wonderful server) recommended the PB and J old fashioned... I don't even typically order them and this cocktail was so delicious and different. (Pictured below garnished with a pb and j sandwich).  Boyfriend order drunken skirt steak- cooked perfectly, tasted delicious (he only let me have a bite :) ). Tender, full of flavor and so juicy!   I ordered the salmon which they do cook to the temperature requested. So nice tender but skin had a perfect crisp.   For appetizer we did order the cornbread muffins with the best tasting butter I ever had and duck fat fries. I'm a Midwesterner so requested ranch with the fries. \"All they had was a house made bacon ranch.\" And the problem is?... it was delicious!   Ordered ice cream sandwiches for dessert with a snickerdoodle cookie. Delicious!   Foods great, amazing service! Wanted to speak with manager to compliment Chris and the staff but we were going to see a show. (I did send an email in case Searsucker does read this). Highly recommend! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Are there any restaurants in Vegas that suck?! My wife and I had the wild boar pasta and the pork butt after starting out with the short rib. Everything was amazing, especially the wold boar pasta and short rib. The short rib is topped with crispy onion strings, which serve as the perfect compliment with the hearty gravy and mashed potatoes. For beverages I went with a mezcal cocktail and the \"strawpeno\" margarita. Very excellent as well."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.Drove to Vegas to see my dad and let him meet the kids. I insisted on taking him to dinner at my favorite spot in San Diego; searsucker in Las Vegas. What a disappointment; service was below average waiter acted bothered and had attitude when asking questions; ordered the 145 dollar tomahawk that's was not seasoned and they had it sliced into strips and off the bone. Also it looked substantially  smaller than normal and no juice( ordered many times at del mar location) Not to mention the sides came 5 minutes after steak did and rest of dinner came in 5-10 after the steak arrived. About 30/40 minutes for a unseasoned and dry steak. Tomato soup was not hot; somewhere between cold and warm and bacon and egg dish was soggy. Major disappointment for owner who has top chef status. Oh let's not mention my old fashion was half maybe 3/4 filled. Lastly the bell hoy was in our face ever minute to collect dishes and took leftover chicken before I can take home. I spend 350 and waiter took time to add top of 20%. Major disappointment after putting a lot of talk into the dinner leading up to the dinner. Everyone left disappointed.   Update- management did reach out and was very professional and response. For this I raise you a star."}
{"text":"Excellent service!   Food--We ordered 4 small dishes since there are so many yummy choices and also highly recommended by the waiter.  -tuna tartar: excellent dish we might come back just for this. -bacon pork belly: it's served on a piece of toast and topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce (egg Benedict style). Overall it's good however we couldn't overlook the fatty layers. -short rib: it's basically s piece of roast beef, served on bed of mashed potato and topped with shredded fried onions. The roast beef is very bland.  -bone marrow: would not recommend this dish. The amount of bone marrow wasn't enough to spread on 4 pieces of baguettes. It's extremely fatty. I'm not sure how to justify the price on bones that otherwise get thrown away. The bed of toast Brussel sprouts were burned.   The habanero coriander pickles are very pickle-y. Pickle lovers would totally enjoy it. Thanks for the free Yelp checkin offer!!  Overall the experience would have been a lot better if we didn't order the fatty dishes (visible fat and running oil). The room temperature was soooo cold that having fat in the palette just didn't work."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. I wanted it to be soo much better, but still ok.  I wouldn't come back though.  Meza grill is a lot better. Don't order the ballerina drink. As for food the chorizo corn off the cob was the best, tasty and spicy. The filet was a too salty, but definitely much better than their Cesar salad. All in all ok, but I'd rather spend my money else where."}
{"text":"Cesar, our server was great so does Efren.  Very attentive!  We're so impressed.  However, the 2 hostesses tonight was !  They seemed to be checking something in the computer but were giggling while we wait to be greeted.  The other male host from Omnia who I thought was a guest was talking to them... I move forward to see what these two hostesses were doing in the computer and they were checking something on line!  While the line builds up!  When the hostess in black felt that I was checking what they were on... She changed the screen to the seating arrangement screen... Busted!!!!  And sat us.  They don't have name tags and we did not bother to ask.  So far food was good especially the crab cake and Mac and cheese!  Again,  just thumbs down on the 2 hostesses."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our visit here recently.  The food was mediocre at best and way overpriced.  The cheddar puffs are a dry, dense copy of Red Lobster's biscuits.  My friend's meal was overcooked, our salads were overdressed, and my entree was bland.  Portions were tiny all around, especially for the price.  We were so disappointed that we spoke to the table next to us about their meal and they echoed our experience.  To top it off, our server was inattentive and somewhat rude and the music was so loud you simply could not hold a conversation.  I won't be back to give it another go; there are plenty of far better options nearby."}
{"text":"I came to Searsucker for the first time for a pre holiday dinner with the family. My eldest brother was a big fan of the location in San Diego and highly recommended it.  The place itself is very well laid out, and the decor and lighting rendered itself as an 'old west' theme mended with more modern architectural design. The theme of rope and wood paired with the old time style light bulbs were a nice combination that were complimented by lots of warm cove lights and well placed accent fixtures. Very relaxing.  One of the first things said was that they were known for their cocktails. Damn you mean to say I have to sample a bunch of drinks? Count me in! My gf and I had the Lieutenant Dan because well, I sure as hell couldn't resist. Probably one of the most refreshing cocktails I have had in a while- not the strongest in the world, but I think if they had loaded it up it wouldn't have been that refreshing. Both of my brothers order the Peter Rabbit- served in a copper cup. The two that were ordered looked a little different. When they noticed they decided to swap and compare the tastes- they were also a bit different. When we told the waiter he explained that all depending on the pour, they can appear different but will often taste the same. When we said they also tasted different, he apologized and bought us a round without batting an eye. We told him he didn't have to do that but he insisted and quickly got us another round on the house. For those who are wondering about the customer service- um....yeah. Either way, I'm not usually a cocktail guy but if you're stopping in here it is certainly going to be a treat to yourself to try some. They won't get you all crunk- but you just may be pleasantly surprised.  The food is one of my favorite styles- American classic. Minimal but hearty plates that you can easily share with others at the table. We began with some starters- I HAD to order the Pork Belly as its one of my favorite cuts, but we also ordered the duck fat fries. The pork belly was some the best I have ever had. It was simple, and all the flavors stood out very nicely. The duck fat fries- well, if you've ever had duck fat fries you already know where I'm going with this but all I will say is if you come here: order these! You will not be disappointed. Entrees- my brother and I decided to share the Duck x 3 and the Tongue and Cheek. Some of the best and most unique cuts of meat- delicious and I highly recommend. My gf decided to get two starters for her entree: the Farm Bird Lollipops, and a 'chicken and waffle' dish that I don't see on the online menu. I only tried the lollipops which were good- but I would suggest getting them as an appetizer (the pork belly and duck beforehand didn't exactly give them their due). All around, the food is delicious. Although some of it may seem 'adventurous', I highly recommend trying something new here if you haven't had it. I think you'll find something you really like.  Overall, this place is great. The cocktails, food and ambiance are top notch. You will notice the four dollar signs on the Yelp profile- a few extra dollars will be spend here. All depending on your budget, I may not suggest Searsucker for a casual meal. However, if you're looking for a special occasion kind of place, or your budget just doesn't matter (I envy you if that's the case), Searsucker will act as a great solution if you're in the Scottsdale area.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Perhaps the kitchen was having an off night but the food in here was proactively bad. Short rib was dry/bland. Ceviche was sad/tired and lacked any citrus punch. Mushroom and buratta was flavorless. The only reason I don't give it 1 star are the brussel sprouts were delicious and the service was pretty friendly...although the server didn't ask why we left the short rib completely uneaten. Overall a huge bummer for what we were expecting."}
{"text":"Very overpriced!!! Food was good but not in any way outstanding. Service was very good but didn't make up for the other negatives. Won't go back. Seriously doubt if this restaurant is still in business a year from now."}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday. The meal was awesome! My girlfriend is a vegetarian, although I've recently gotten her to try some fish. They made small plates special for her. First was a salad with mixed greens, strawberries, candied walnuts,  and a raspberry vinaigrette...very good. For me they brought the pork belly...delicious!!! 2nd round they unfortunately brought her another salad...not the ideal place for vegetarians I must say, nonetheless, the 2nd salad had figs and goat cheese and greens with a delicious dressing...she said it was excellent, I liked it too! With the delicious, spicy bread balls we had initially, we were already feeling full, so she canceled her main course and we split the tuna. My vegetarian girlfriend loved it! lol I also really enjoyed it! Sushi grade with the skin attached...really tasty! Overall, a great restaurant...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I first heard that there was a new restaurant from one of the Top Chef contestants, I was very excited.  I'm a huge fan of the show, and everything that they cook always looks amazing!  So, I bought a Living Social deal and was excited to use it.  Then, I both heard and read mixed reviews, and I became a little less excited.  But, I'm very happy to say that I went last night and it was FANTASTIC!  First I must talk about one dish that was quite possibly the best vegetable dish I've ever put in my mouth:  the mushrooms with burrata and toast small plate.  Words cannot express how much my friend and I enjoyed this dish.  It is a small skillet filled with mushrooms that are cooked in something heavenly, and then you pile the mushrooms, burrata, and arugula on top of this perfectly thick, soft, buttery toast.  My only complaint was that there wasn't more toast!  But even that wasn't so bad because I could have just eaten those mushrooms for days.  This was about as flavorful of a dish as I've ever had.  The other fantastic small dish that we had was the chicken and waffle.  I was hesitant at first because the batter was made with Frank's Red Hot Sauce in it, and I am not a fan of hot sauce.  Much to my joy, the dish tasted nothing like hot sauce but just had a fantastic depth of flavor.  I am from the south, and I am not sorry to admit that this was my first chicken and waffle!  I hope they're all like this!  Also, it did not say on the menu, but I believe the chicken was stuffed with maybe ham or proscuitto and some sort of cheese.  It was delicious.  Our last small plate was the scallop with bacon and caramel.  This was the one that we were most excited about, but it turned out to be somewhat disappointing.  After the other two, we were expecting to be amazed again, and we were not.  It was good, but, I will probably not order it again, whereas I will be returning as soon as I can for the other two dishes.    To top it all off, they give you these fantastic cheese biscuits when you arrive.  They are vey moist and flavorful and a great way to start the meal.  I only have two things to complain about, one of which was my fault.  I ordered the $12 La Primavera cocktail, and it was awful.  It is made with berry vodka, St. Germain, and Campari.  I love St. Germain and vodka, so I ordered this, not knowing what Campari is.  Well, it's a bitters, and, man, was this drink bitter!  I hate sending things back, but I had to send this back.  I can't imagine that anyone would like that, but, I guess if you're a fan of bitters, you might.  Our server was nice enough to take it off my tab, but that was about his only redeeming quality.  He wasn't a jerk or anything, but he wasn't particularly friendly either.  Also, we hardly ever saw him.  The restaurant was not anywhere near packed on a Wednesday night, but, for whatever reason, we saw everyone else who worked there a whole lot more often than our server.  The table next to him even had to ask another server to hunt him down at one point.  Having said that, though, it certainly wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't return.  Overall, both my friend and I were extremely pleased with our experience.  We left raving about the food and were just full enough but not disgustingly full after 3 small plates and cheese biscuits.  I will be going back soon, and I only hope that their other dishes are as good as these!"}
{"text":"I expected better, Searsucker!!  We came for dinner on a Sunday and ordered 3 appetizers, and 3 entrees over four people. The service was good, and our server seemed to know a lot about the menu and recommended some dishes that we ended up ordering.  Here's my report: crab cake jumbo lump + fennel + aioli - delicious  short rib \"the harlot\" + horseradish + fried onion - probably the highlight of the meal artichoke hearts + cheddar + mozzarella - this was a dip with poor execution - this is why. They gave us a very large portion of this cheesy dip with three pieces of bread. When we asked for more bread (more than half the dip left with no toast) we were told that they would have to charge us for it. pork butt - standard, nothing special butcher steak - did not try this, however the presentation was nice.  Sorry, but when you're spending $200+ on a meal I'd expect to receive a sufficient amount of bread to go with my dip.   Return Factor: None."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday night for a party of six and had a great time. Drinks were tasty and refreshing. My favorite was the strawberry jalapeño margarita. Our server was very knowledgeable and suggested some scrumptious dishes. For starters, our table had two orders of the following: bone marrow, calamari steak and duck fat fries. For the main course we had the 36 oz Tomahawk ribeye with sautéed mushroom side, New York Steak with corn jalapeño, two orders of fish and chips, braised pork, grilled cheese and tomato soup for the kids. Everything was delicious but the Tomahawk was a tad too salty and cooked Medium rather than the Medium-rare we preferred.  The star of the meal was the bone marrow. We all agreed that the next time we come back we will just order ten of those bone marrow! We were too full to try any desserts. Our server gave us chips for free expedited access to Omnia. It was a busy night for Omnia being it was its two-year anniversary and Kaskade as the main dj but we did not have any problem getting in. I'm already planning on coming back when we go to Vegas again next month."}
{"text":"Incredibly bad service. Took 3 hours from when we sat down till they finally figured out our bill. The manager was busy flirty with all off the waitstaff. The entire serving staff was talking and not paying attention to our table. I had to go to the bar on several occasions to get our drinks.   At the end of the meal our server took 45 minutes. ( not exaggerating) to get the ticket right. I was added items that I did not order. Finally after asking the manager to fix the error I paid 20 bucks extra in cash just to leave.   Food was not worth all the hassle. Plenty of options I would stay clear until they fix the service. Ruined the night."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even waste money to go there again. The food is pretty horrible. I got a salmon and it was that worst I had in a long time. The location I would say is nice and inviting but that's pretty much it"}
{"text":"My daughter brought me here after having attended a yelp event. I had the lobster roll and added the fries. The bread on the lobster roll is the best! It is just like you get back east and was perfectly toasted. The whole sandwhich was really great and the salad that comes with it had just the right amount of balsamic. The brown sugar butter sauce that comes with the fries is really tasty. I also had the lemon bar and fruit for dessert. It had lots of great flavor without being overpowering.   What really stood out was our server. Allard was so helpful and nice. He brought us a dinner menu since I wanted to come back and try more and aswered all the questions I had about what was on it. He really took time to help us and kept our drinks full and was very sweet. I can't wait to go back and try more. It was all so good!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! My new favorite weekend brunch spot. The 'boring' breakfast was amazing. Maple bacon, potatoes were to die for, and everything was prepared perfectly. They also have live music and bottomless mimosas. My friends and I had fantastic service when we were here for brunch.   I have also been here for dinner- dinner was definitely on the pricy side but they have good deals during happy hour. The one time I was here during happy hour I was disappointed by the service at the bar (happy hour is only in the bar area) but the other times I've visited the service has been great."}
{"text":"This is the best new restaurant in Vegas!  It's also a rarity being an eating establishment on the Strip that has a Happy Hour!  We went to Happy Hour after reading the great reviews.  We were not disappointed at all.    The food we ate was tremendous.  The crab cake was as good as we have ever had, be in Boston or Baltimore.  The shrimp and grits, while advertised as spicy, is not spicy enough to keep my wife's delicate palate from loving it!  The strawberry champagne salad is unique and superb!  As other people have stated, the portions are better than most Happy Hour foods.  We finished the meal off with the pumpkin dessert, very good.    What so many restauranteurs don't realize is that a good Happy Hour draws people in to sample your food, service, and cocktails.  If you pass that step, then you have customers who are coming back regardless of being Happy Hour or not. That is us.  We will come back for the pork butt, the filet, the salmon entree, the mahi, the scallops, etc.  The prices on those dishes aren't outrageous.  They aren't the best, but if you have dined on the Strip, you know you are paying top dollar.  At least here you get fantastic, friendly service and exceptional food.    FWIW, I've owned a restaurant, been a general manager, a bar manager, a bartender, and a waitperson, oh, and along with a dish washer.  I am judging this eatery on one visit, but boy, it was an unbelievably exceptional visit.    We will be back!  Oh, forgot to mention a pet peeve of mine they overcame.  Sitting at the bar, Searsucker had more than one person wait on you, EVEN ask you if you want another drink or some more water!  What mattered to them was if you had good service, not whether a certain bartender waited on you.  Good job, Searsucker!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere.   Went for Restaurant Week so didn't get to experience the whole menu (Not a big deal, really my only complaint is that I was really looking forward to some bone marrow which they did not have on the event menu)  Started with Whiskey (as one does) then ordered Chicken Lollipops and Shrimp in bacon grits - Shrimp was great, Grits were amazing (I fully recommend ordering them as a side)   We then had the Crab topped Ono with horseradish and chimichurri and a perfectly medium rare filet with lobster butter as well as sides of brussel sprouts in walnuts and buttered potato (just think decedent mashed potatoes)  Both entrees were delicious but if I had to choose just one (which would be hard) I'd go with the beef - it was melt in your mouth perfect.  Topped it all off with red velvet cake and chocolate mousse while we polished off the bottle of wine and a perfect night out.  I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. Not at all impressed with the food.  Portions were very small.  I am a small eater and ususally get filled up quickly.  But I left there yesterday still a bit hungry.  Nice salad of lettuce and strips of poultry.  Our menu said there were meatballs being served.  The meatballs consisted of just a couple bowls of them on a table which probably sat 15-18 people.  They were bite sized and most people got just 1 and some did not get any.  We were waiting for them to bring more out but instead they came back with the dessert.  A tiny, probably 1.5-2 inch square of red devil sponge cake.  No soft drinks, etc, only water was served.  I had been considering to go back some day for HH but at the size of servings I would probably have to order 5 of the HH menu. I had hoped that I would really like this place, but alas no."}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing food great service accommodated a large group of friends for his bachelor party great place to have dinner while in LV and waiting to get into Ominia"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about. I wasn't impressed.   A. the location is awkward. Walk inside this weird building and then walk through a second set of doors to get to actual restaurant. It's slightly off the beaten path so it's not somewhere I would go for night-cap drinks.   B. Granted I was only there for happy hour with some friends, I just wasn't impressed with the food. I think it's overpriced for what it is. You can get a better meal at Citizen or Cowboy Ciao. Maybe I had too high of expectations. But isn't this supposed to be a Top Chef restaurant? The one in San Diego is supposedly amazing. I was really excited...and then I was let down. It's like when you're really hungry and you eat something and it just wasn't satisfying but you're full and can't eat anymore. We ordered a bunch of different things: shrimp and grits, meatballs, scallops, tacos, and some other stuff. Wait, did I say scallops? I mean SCALLOP. Singular. It was one. For like $10 or something like. It was good. But overpriced. The tacos were shortrib and they were just whatever. The meatballs were good. The shrimp and grits were whatever. They're better at Cowboy Ciao.   The drinks were just whatever too. I ordered the Peter Rabbit. That was good. But I wasn't sure there was booze in it. I ordered another drink and it wasn't great. It was meh.   C. The decor is awesome. I love how it's decorated. It's def cute. But those damn barstools at the little tables in the bar area are awful. Sitting on hard wood with no back support is not enjoyable. I wish we could've sat in those comfy looking couches. If that were the case, I'd probs sit there and booze it up for awhile.   I'll give it another shot and actually have a full dinner to see if things are different. But as of now, I'm just not impressed. Step up your game Searsucker."}
{"text":"Food was ok I was hoping it would be the same as the sear sucker  in San Diego but the food was just bland . The squid was good though just too saucy for me . We also had the duck fat fries nothing special , tuna albacore and spinach salad. This place is next to the omnia night club."}
{"text":"Seersucker is a case of \"just fine\" food in a great location. They're in a prime Caesar's location and offer (for Ceasars) pretty reasonable prices.   We made a reservation and I'd advise you to do that, since Searsucker seems rather popular. It's a good sized space with modern furniture and a menu that encourages sharing. We started with corn muffins ($5) and hot damn!!! these are some tasty bites - a bit spicy, full of bacon and served with sweet butter. Yum!   For dinner, I had a Cobb salad ($16?) which was ok - I asked for dressing in the side and never revived any at all. See: service, below.  My dining companions opted for more meaty choices and seemed happy. Our side of mac''cheese ($16) was overly salty but used wagon wheel pasta which made me happy.   Service...yeah, not the best. Our server was honestly kind of bitchy for no reason. I didn't get a side of salad dressing and didn't want to ask because she was attitude-y Judy & I didn't want spit infused ranch. I'm guessing with a different server this place would be 4 for me."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place for business lunch. Great burger and good prices. 100% quality."}
{"text":"Nice selection of small plates and cocktails. The service was great, and we enjoyed our meal. I definitely will come back on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money at all! Their options of small plates are pretty limited but the dumbfounded aspect is finding out the grilled chicken addition to our salad was more expensive than the actual salad. It was $15 while the salad alone was $12. I wish the server told us prior rather than us finding out on the bill."}
{"text":"Interesting and fun but not quite delivering the goods for the price.  My wife and I stopped in for happy hour the other night to check out the new place in town.  We arrived around 5:30 and there were perhaps 20 people in the bar and restaurant.  We sat at the bar and ordered five appetizers and some drinks.  We tried some of their signature drinks and thought they were pretty tasty.  We liked all the appetizers, although they tended to be on the small side with the exception of the squid, which was a standard portion size.    The atmosphere is modern, hip and fun although I have to say it seems to be trying a bit too hard in certain respects.  I like a modern eclectic feel as much as the next guy, but sometimes they're a bit too creative for their own good here.  For example, instead of a napkin, you get a kind of quilted kitchen towel.  Sure, why not, but we're veering into the realm of the twee and the forced with this kind of thing.  The bar stools however seem to have been designed by the Marquis de Sade.  They are literally the most uncomfortable bar stools I have ever sat in.  They're a kind of rippled, heavy western style wood with no back. So you've got no support for your back and, worse, the wood cuts sharply into your thigh.  Looking around the bar, virtually every single person at the bar was standing next to their seat.    The bar began to fill up with single women and seemed to maintain a roughly 8:1 ratio of women to men, a phenomena I've noticed at other high-end joints in town.  The bartenders were very friendly as were the other patrons.  Final verdict?  Mixed.  In a town where every restaurant serves the same comfort food classics, it is definitely encouraging to see somebody dare to serve something other than cheeseburgers and the like.  On the other hand, the portions were really a bit skimpy, even at Happy Hour prices.  Five appetizers later, we were still a bit hungry and that's not really so happy.  (Try eating five appetizers at Wildfish or Rokerij. Go ahead, I dare you.)  There's a certain Scottsdale bimbo quality to the place (and I'm not talking about the clientele).  It looks great but it's not terribly comfortable and in the end, you may not be quite as satisfied as you thought.  Five appetizers, two cocktails, a wine and a beer were $50 bucks plus tip.  NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: Change the damn bar stools already!"}
{"text":"First time- Great wine and food. I didn't take pictures of the apps but I highly suggest the. Calamari steak and duck fat fries. I had the 6oz filet medium rare and it was come to perfection. The creamy kale added to the flavor, which a happy mouth. My friends 2lb lobster was fabulous. It was juicy and easy to open up and eat."}
{"text":"A large group of us came here for dinner a few weeks ago. First off, our waitress (I believe her name is Lindsey - shorter and blond?) was wonderful!! She knew the whole menu, and she never missed a beat with our group.  Drinks: When Doves Cry - Two thumbs up Snake in the Grass - meh. Too sweet, it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it. We had a taste of a syrah that was just terrible. Maybe it had been open too long, or maybe the wine was just that bad.  We had more cocktails and quite a few wines, but I don't remember enough about them to post anything.  Food: Braised Pork Butt - Tasty, more than enough food by itself! Scallops - Great, definitely worth ordering Bigeye Tuna - Very good, though it could have used a little more flavor to kick it up a notch Tacos - looked good but were itty bitty. Some of the smallest tacos I have ever seen. The warm spinach salad looked a little on the small side too. Though spinach really shrinks up with heat so maybe that is why.  Also, for those wondering...the things listed under 'Jars and Sliced' literally come in a jar. Not great if you are sharing, but fun if it is just for you.  Overall, a great option for dinner close to the strip!"}
{"text":"Inside Caesars, you find this gem. Loved the decor! We all shared the huge (36oz) and amazing tomahawk steak - feed 6 people. Mac n cheese was bomb! Brussel sprouts and walnuts delish!  Service was good. You won't be disappointed with the food. Only gripe is that we could only do the happy hour drinks at the bar, not offered 5-7pm in dinning room."}
{"text":"This is the first time in Vegas and we arrived late to our hotel (Ceasar's). The searsucker was one of the only restaurants open at the time; the ambiance appeared nice from the outside, so we have it a shot. 1st look at menu revealed extremely high prices ($46 for fish and chips!). Our experience was that food was average at best and not worth the cost. Duck fat fries, which we were told was one of the specialties, was not savory. The best appetizer was the steak calamari. The best part of our experience at this restaurant was service; our waitress was outstanding, attentive, and very friendly. Also, food arrived fast. Overall, we felt food was not worth cost, and being from NYC, I am somewhat accustomed to pricey places but expect quality in return!"}
{"text":"The pork butt was so moist and delicious, with the apple slaw on top it set it off. The Brussels sprouts were under cooked and did not have good flavor. The duck fat fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"Very spacious and a very attentive wait staff (probably because there were only 4 tables seated at the time so with 2 managers, a few hostesses and multiple busboys and waitresses the service should be good).  Food was pretty good. The spicy pickle was excellent as were the sidedishes. The entrees and dessert were a little of a let down. Another negative is that while they do have some decent local beers available with their menu they could do a much better job at having a larger beer selection and they should include some Belgian beers like a wit or triple to go with the seafood.  Expect to spend at least $60 per person as everything is ala carte."}
{"text":"I was soo happy to make it this restaurant for dinner on Saturday... We missed our original reservation and had to change it several times that night... Luckily, we made it to the restaurant at 11:40pm and made it for the \"late night\" menu..  Everything we ordered was bomb, with the exception of one dish...   Need to order: duck fat fries + tomato jam,  \"Caesar\" romaine + kale + egg + parm, and short rib \"the harlot\" + horseradish + fried.. ALL TASTY AND YUMMY!!  One dish that was not on the \"late night\" menu was-- beet + radish + crème fraîche + goat cheese WHICH the kitchen was able to make for us-- AWESOME!! VERY YUMMY!!  Dessert to order: S'mores Bar--  Graham + salted caramel ganache + honey  chocolate mousse + marshmallow + chocolate ice cream + cookie crumble... ABSOLUTELY SCRUMPTIOUS!!   I was disappointed about the-- farm bird lollipops + hot sauce + bleu.  I can handle spicy, but this was soo spicy I couldn't enjoy it.  We didn't ask for it to be taken off the bill, but the waitress should've asked when she noticed we didn't like it when only of the lollipops were missing from the dish (which was on my plate) when we asked her to take it away.    Other than that, our overall experience was great!!  I live in southern California and totally looking forward to visiting the San Diego location in the near future..."}
{"text":"Had such an AMAZING dinner! The food was fantastic, ambiance was great and our server Chris made our experience. He was so helpful and gave great recommendations. Would definitely recommend the calamari, NY steak, and SCALLOPS. The craft cocktails were really tasty. Can't wait to try other locations. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the many, many places just around the corner within the giant maze that is Caesars.  Went here for happy hour.  Had about six small plates.  The spicy shrimp ceviche was excellent.  The artichoke heart cheese dip was not good (the artichoke hearts were tough).  The mushrooms were a little dry.  The duck fat dipped fries were nice and the ketchup had a little kick in it which was nice.  The shrimp remoulade was pretty tangy.  Overall, a nice place to get a bite right after work.  And our server was named Caesar; although I suspect they are all named Caesar."}
{"text":"What a great food!!!! OMG! We ordered so many things of the menu and absolutely everything was top notch. And what a cute waiter...^^ Also, if a person spends $50 you get a no line chip to get to OMNIA. Good deal for this amazing food and drinks!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 and the food was incredible. The service was good but not great."}
{"text":"I had the Cobb with honey mustard dressing and it was fantastic and the ginger smash was perfect.  I watched a few people order happy hour items that all looked great!   Service (mine was Philip) was laid back not too slow but not all up in your business either.  I would come back."}
{"text":"The wife and I dined at Searsucker on a Sunday night.  We had no problem getting a table for two at 7:30.  We started off with a round of drinks.  Searsucker's cocktails and house-made infusions were solid.  I had the Kinda Old Fashioned ($18) made with Jack Single Barrel whiskey, Montenegro Amaro, Ancho Reyes liqueur, sweet vermouth, old fashioned syrup, and bitters.  It was boozy and bitter with the right amount of sweetness.  The wife's Jalaberry Strawpeno ($13) was a jalapeno and strawberry infused tequila with lime and agave.  It was a nice, fresh take on a margarita.  For our food, we shared orders of the Blistered Shishito Peppers ($11), Calamari Steak ($16), and Fish & Chips ($42).  All of the dishes were tasted good to outstanding.  The Fish & Chips, a beautifully presented fried whole branzino with waffle cut, sweet potato chips, was excellent, but I felt a bit overpriced.  The Blistered Shishito Peppers were the closest thing to a miss for me.  They were blistered, but possessed a wilted texture that seemed like they were more steamed than roasted over a fire or in a hot skillet.  However, the Calamari Steak, thick cuts of calamari deep fried to a perfect fork tenderness and topped with a chili honey glaze, was the standout dish and the best fried calamari dish I've ever had.  Searsucker was a pleasant surprise.  Frankly, given the lineup of celebrity chef-driven restaurants in Las Vegas, let alone in Caesars Palace, Searsucker seemed to me to be somewhat of an afterthought, a backup plan restaurant choice.  Searsucker deserves better than that as they're easily Caesars' best bet for tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Went with a large party and had the chance to try tons of small plates. The pork belly appetizer is a stand-out item. We also had the shrimp and grits (good), squid (ok), tuna himachi (heard it was good, don't like sushi), and crab cake (very good). I got the scallops with cous cous. The scallops were perfectly cooked and a decent size. Tried the corn off the cob which was good not awesome, but good. I was stuffed by the end of the meal. Perrier Jouet sold by the glass made this place even better!"}
{"text":"I am blown away! I loved Searsucker . . . but I have to admit that I thought it was a bad location from the very beginning. But, of course, no one asked me . . . so I kept my mouth shut  . . . well, except when I was enjoying a Peter Rabbit (no ice please!). My fingers are crossed that Brian will reopen in a much better location in Scottsdale. Please, please, please."}
{"text":"I had previously visited the San Diego location last year and declared the Peter Rabbit to be the best cocktail I have ever tried in my life!  I was excited to see that they built an outpost right in my backyard on Camelback, so my boyfriend and I went last Saturday night for an impromtu date night.  The atmosphere was more open than the Diego location, and it seemed more spacious.  It was DEFINITELY easier to get a dinner reservation too!  We checked in for our 8:30 and cozied up to the bar for my old love Peter.  The bar manager was incredibly attentive and when I told him about my love affair with Peter, even poured me a sample of his favorite cocktail \"The Health Food\" which had Pimm's cup and celery, among other things.  It was so good, my boyfriend ordered one once we were sat for dinner.  Definitely A+ for the bar manager, you could really tell he was proud of his establishment and excited about helping us discover new boozey treasures.    The ambiance of the restaurant is definitely trendy, and a little on the louder side, but I knew this going in and it was what I expected.  It would make a fun place for a group dinner, a girls night out, or an excuse to put on a black dress and heels for date night.  We wound up deciding to order all small plates, because we were in that kind of noshing mood.  The complementary cheddar puff biscuit things were good, but not as good as I remembered in Diego.  Perhaps because they were cold?  A little salty?  I don't know, we still ate them, and I do appreciate a departure from the normal boring bread basket so I'll take this any day.  We started with the shishito peppers, which were good, but to my disappointment, they were lacking any kind of heat.  My favorite part about ordering shishitos is getting that occasional renegade one like a game of russian roulette for your mouth!  They were about as spicy as a bell pepper, and our busser actually told us that they had to briefly take them off the menu because customers were complaining that they were too spicy.  How annoying!  Jesus people, don't order peppers if you don't like spicy things, and thanks for ruining it for the rest of us!  We also ordered the marrow, which I have never tried anywhere before.  I am adventurous so this wasn't a problem, and I found it to be absolutely delicious, once you get past the part that you are actually scooping out marrow from humongous bones.  It was a delicacy, rich, flavorful, and one of the highlights of our meal.  We tried the pork belly, which was nice, but I have had better.  I would have liked it to be rendered more, maybe a little more flavor.  It did, indeed remind me of breakfast since it was served with an egg and I think I would order it again for brunch.  Four our last tasting we had the spicy shrimp and grits and the jalapeno corn which were both delicious.  We were too full to attempt dessert.  I will definitely recommend this place to friends and I am excited to come back.  We even ran into the owner Brian while we were here.  Welcome to the neighborhood Searsucker!  You will fit right in!"}
{"text":"Spend $50 or more and it gets you into the omini no line.  Tapas: Crab cakes: too salty, fishy & the crust was soggy. Strawberry pecan salad: over priced Habinero  Pepper & pickles: too briny with a kick of spice. Bone marrow: nothing special, fatty oily marrow with onion jam over two tiny pieces of toast.  But getting into the club without waiting was nice."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite meal in Vegas! Take my advice, and go to this place around 5-6pm. They have a great happy hour menu.  I've had a lot of burgers in my life, and this HAS to be the best I've had. Upgrade to the duck fat fries for a dollar, trust me you won't regret that extra dollar.  This place is A++ in my book and would highly recommend it. For you whiskey drinkers, get the \"Bad Bad.\" All in all, this place is fairly pricey, but if you go during the happy hour menu, you won't pay through the nose for a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"After finding several bars downtown were closed for New Year's day, we went back to the strip for happy hour.  Searsucker is a southern influenced gastropub, with a really great happy hour featuring $9 Old-fashioneds and $2 oysters (not just the standard bluepoints everyone is giving you nowadays.) We also had sliders and bone marrow ($2 per bone at happy hour.)  The star of the visit was the fried pigs ear. They are cut into small strips, marinated for hours and then lightly fried, for a more delicate texture than you're expecting. They are deliciously salty with an appropriate hit of tartness.   The oysters come prepared with a mignonette of micro mint and pomegranate. Each oyster rests on a thick salt bed, which we viewed as a little fussy. I also took off the mint leaves as they interfered with the oyster flavor. The pomegranate, on the other hand, is a great pairing.  The old-fashioneds were prepared classically and well-balanced. This is definitely the best choice for happy hour in Caesar's Palace and perhaps the entire Strip."}
{"text":"Every time I drive by this building, I look to see my car in the third story windows. Architects are cool.  Malarkey says visiting Arizonans encouraged him to open a branch here. Putting the daily operations into the hands of chef Steven \"Chops\" Smith, 37, who seems to have worked in every local kitchen, including Different Pointe of View, Olive & Ivy, Noca, Furio, Luc's and St. Francis.  Cooking style is divided into categories as Bites, Smalls, Greens, Ocean, Ranch and Farm. Having visited the San Diego \"Gas Lamp\" store, I was also impressed at the Scottsdale location which reminds me of an awesome bachelor pad.  Looks like from what I remember, Searsucker Scottsdale pretty much duplicated the menu and design of the Diego mother ship. But after a while I would expect Smith to put his own stamp on the menu.  In California I learned to enjoy stout from a beer knowledgeable gal at the tap room. So I see Karl Strauss Imperial Stout on the menu and since I have been to Karl's I go for it. It pours black. Coffee dominates with some cocoa and roasted malts. Taste is very smooth. $12 for the bomber, a 22 oz.  From the ranch I order the hanger \"butcher's steak\" with watercress, bbq, and blue fondue  $26. One of my favorite meals."}
{"text":"Happy Hour review:  I came here for Happy Hour. To drink, I got the bad bad t-roy brown. I don't typically order cocktails but I really liked this one. I ordered two. The first one was great. The second was good but it didn't seem like it was muddled/mixed well enough. I also ordered the potato fries, pork chips and short rib sandwich. The portions were much bigger than I expected. Everything was good. The potato fries were great. I liked the chipotle ketchup. The short rib in the short rib sandwich was good. I think the bread was a bit too thick so it wasn't balanced. I ended up picking out some of the meat and the onions. The pork chips were good but I thought the sauce was just a tad too sweet. I think Seersucker is a solid choice for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This is a must eat place!!! Everything was perfection! Delicious!!!  Do it! You'll thank me later I promise"}
{"text":"Got the roasted chicken and it was very dry. Was disappointed for how much it cost! Also our server was very snoody!"}
{"text":"We took a group of ten and ordered virtually every appetizer on the menu. The cauliflower, macaroni, fig toast, hummus, and brussels spouts were pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the bone marrow or pigs ears (though the guy sitting to my left was). The caprese was ok (my wife really liked it, though). The bread part of the caprese was burnt and too hard in my opinion.   If all we'd gotten were appetizers and it hadn't taken 30 minutes to get them, it would be a four-star review.   However, and just speaking for my main course, it was nasty. The waiter did a good job selling me on the special--a portion of the 75 lb. pig they'd just roasted. They brought me a pile of pork, yes, but it was cold and very grisly. I couldn't eat more than a couple of pieces. Very disappointing.   The atmosphere was also very loud, and although the waiter knows the menu well, he spoke too fast and in a rote fashion--clearly a result of having repeated the same thing too many times, so between that and the loud background (music in addition to other people), we had to ask him to repeat himself several times.   I guess when you spend over $800 on a meal, you expect the food and service to be excellent."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awful.   The atmosphere screams tacky sports bar. The whole place feels as if you're sitting in a food court with giant flat screens everywhere, including the cheap furniture and uncomfortable chairs. Poorly lit and loud.   And this is the sort of place where the servers try to jack up the bill as high as they can. You know, where they ask if you would like water and then charge you $9 for a bottle of Fiji without asking you. Or letting you order a $10 side of fries with an entree that already comes with french fries. As if the $65 steak entrees weren't over-priced enough.   The service timing is horrible, too. Despite the prices, this is NOT fine dining by any stretch of the imagination. These folks have no idea what they are doing when it comes to service.   And to top it all off, the food is bland and overly salty. Horrible. The $18 rib starter that we had was so dreadful that we scaled back our entire dinner plans and decided less would definitely be the theme of the evening.   The wine list is equally pretentious and over-priced. $125 for wine that retails for $15 at the grocery store. Other mediocre bottles that are priced in the $600(!?!?!) range. Please.  If you have very little experience with fine dining, you might mistake expensive for quality. Don't be fooled. Michelin is not going to be calling these folks anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best thing to order here is the bone marrow, well flavored with brussel sprouts and butter that along with the marrow, melts in your mouth.  The lollipop wings were good, chocolate sammies were delicious, duck fat fries were overly seasoned with not even a hint of duck fat taste, but the worst item I had was the braised pork butt.  The pork butt had no flavor besides the pickled tower laid on top.  It was confusing, the pickled vegetables dominated the flavor of the meat, not even letting the true taste exude through the anticipated braised flavor.  Even the smell of the pork had no inviting aroma, very bland.  Staff (such as our server, Cesar who was nice enough to have the pork butt and fries removed from our bill due to our dissatisfaction) and service were excellent, but the braised pork butt...was a bunch of \"malarkey.\""}
{"text":"The staff was the best we had all week in Vegas! Great for watching March Madness games & the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for the grand opening. I only sampled some of the passed hors d'oeuvres but they were all pretty tasty. The one that stood out the most was the beet scallop. The atmosphere is inviting, sexy, hip, and just straight up cool. The space is large but not too large. I am not a fan of big restaurants because they just remind me of chains like Chili's, Cheesecake Factory, etc etc. The drinks are amazing too. I look forward to having a real dinner here soon! I really think this is going to be the new \"it\" spot in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Mixed drinks are expensive but go for the Happy Hour and get the Bone Marrow (only twenty bucks) and DELICIOUS. Servers are very kind and the food was very good."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the money.... food was cold  and awful I had the drunkenskirt steak..salty and undercooked I asked for med well and got med rare. Fries were awful as well. My husband had the Thanksgiving meal it was just ok but definitely not worth $49....at best I wud say $19.99. The service was less than stellar. Had to ask for stuff a minimum of 3 times before I got it. Needless to say won't be going back?"}
{"text":"Came here after a nice day at the pool and my experience was amazing! Lindsey my waitress was so helpful and made great recommendations. I had the Duck which was out of this world! From the ambiance to the service to the food Searsucker Las Vegas is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ugh, where do I start.   Went here as it seemed to be one of the more decently priced and more interesting places on the strip. Unfortunately it kinda sucked. Not the food but just about everything else.   There was a short wait for a table so we were offered a high top or the seats facing the casino floor if we wanted to be seated immediately. I like people watching so facing out was a great place to sit. We ordered the hamachi and jalapeño plate to start along with a couple of beers. The beers took a little bit longer than they should, but the amount of time the hamachi took was appalling. The insulting part was that this dish definitely fits the description of a small plate, it was basically 3 crisps with a slice of the hamachi and vegetables/sauce. The dish itself was great, the cucumbers and jalapeño  worked so well with the fish, tasted incredible. But for what amounts to 3 chips with a slice of fish on them to take over 20 minutes to prepare was pretty bad.   We had also ordered the Ono and a beet salad with goat cheese. The only odd request we had was for the goat cheese to come on the side which isn't a substitution or anything out of line. When the runner came out with them the goat cheese was breaded (not indicated on the menu) and mixed in with the salad. We politely sent it back and requested the goat cheese on the side and not breaded, and some silverware. Our waitress then came back with the salad sans goat cheese. She said she would get some for us and also offered to get some silverware. After waiting several more minutes I just turned around and asked the bartender for silverware. My Ono was no longer warm enough but it was very good.   Unfortunately lack of staff communication and attentiveness ruined this place for me. This is too bad as the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Good location inside of Caesars Palace, next to Omina night club, New style of American cuisine, food size big ."}
{"text":"Long story short: how many times have you sat at home watching the Food Network or some cooking show on TV and thought 'wow that looks interesting' and wished you could try it yourself?    Some of the menu options and flavor combinations are definitely different and might intimidate those who like to play it safe but hey, youre in Vegas! Get out of your comfort zone, be adventurous, try something new! We tried a little bit of everything and it was all good.  No room for dessert."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about our dining experience at Searsucker! The staff was absolutely amazing- friendly, funny, knowledgable, and extremely attentive. The food was out of this world good. I opted to get a few starters as my meal because I just couldn't decide on what to get. The cocktails are equally as delicious as the food.   When we were planning our trip, this was one of my top choices, and it didn't disappoint. We started with the shishito peppers, which I would highly recommend. I got the bacon and eggs and the brussel sprouts. My husband got a steak and asparagus. He's a picky eater and not easy to please, and nearly a week later, he is still talking about how great the food was. We shared the cookies and milk for dessert, and it was such a fun, cozy way to end a fantastic meal.  The open kitchen only adds to the experience. You can see, hear, and smell your food being prepared, and it's such a treat.   I can't wait to come back!"}

{"text":"Wonderful experience. I loved everything we ordered from the shrimp and grits to the \"drunken\" opha fish. Don't miss the jalapeno-corn side dish. The cocktails are very imaginative - I tried their take on a pimms cup. The atmosphere here is very hip, loungy and dark. Our bartender was a little obsessed with another couple and it required us waving him down each time we needed something, but I'm sure service at the tables is better."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a good size and well decor with cool lights.   Bacon eggs (4/5)  Bone marrow (5/5) - I wish there was more bone marrow Mexican shrimps (4/5)  Mac and cheese (3/5) - the mac was not as soft as I like Calamari steak (5/5)  Bread pudding (4/5) Cookie ice cream (4/5)   Overall, great food and nice ambiance. I think the appetizers and shared plates section had better food choices than the main entrees. I definitely would come Back"}
{"text":"I recently went to Searsucker with some work friends and it was great time! The food was great, the service was great and the atmosphere was fun!   The best way to describe the food here is that is something that you will recognize. It's not like some of the other Las Vegas restaurants where you have no idea what the dish consists of. We just ordered a bunch of different plates and shared. The Calamari steak was great! Sweet and tangy and cooked just right! We ordered the Chef's salad and the field greens and pear salad. Very simple salads, with the right flavor. The entrees were the NY Strip, scallops and scampi. The Scampi stood out because it was large, grilled prawns on a bed of squash spaghetti. Never had squash spaghetti before and that was pretty good! Light and overwhelming but a very pleasant flavor. Scallops were awesome! Not much more to say. The NY strip was cooked just right and came with a red wine sauce. All in all a great set of entrees. Desert was warm cookies and cold milk! An old classic but still delicious! The deconstructed key lime pie was my highlight of the night. Didn't expect much from it but it was an amazing flavor (Does come with coconut)!  Mark was our server and he did a great job taking care of us. He even recommended some drinks that had the same alcohol so that our group wasn't mixing! That's attention to detail!"}
{"text":"A friend invited me to Searsucker for a late dinner on a Friday night. Our reservations weren't until 10PM, and the place was bustling when we arrived. We were seated within 5 minutes and led to a small table by a window. Our server and busser introduced themselves promptly and looked quite dapper, if I might add. The menu was filled with interesting choices, but the vegetarian selection was miniscule.   BALLERINA AND THE CZAR ($14): My friend started off with this specialty cocktail, which she said was tasty. I was content with my fancy glass of water. :) 4/5  HABANERO & CORIANDER PICKLE: This was FREE with our Yelp check-in. I hate pickles, so I didn't touch this small appetizer. My friend said they weren't that spicy, but cautioned that she has a heightened tolerance for spicy foods due to her Vietnamese upbringing. 3/5  CHEDDAR PUFFERS: Our server brought these out to us, and I assumed they were complimentary. They reminded me of the bread served at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Casino (except the ones at Eiffel are better!). I thought they were kind of bland. 3/5  QUINOA ($23): This was the only dinner entree option available to me as a veg head. I have difficulty describing this dish. My friend called it 'earthy' after she tasted it. I called it 'grainy'. It was a-okay. 3/5  HANGER BUTCHER STEAK ($32): She ordered the steak and loved it. Awesome presentation, too. 5/5  ERMAHGERD SUNDAE ($10): We shared this and settled on it mainly because the name sounded so hilarious. Not a fan, though. The brownies tasted stale and store bought. The 'gelato' tasted like regular ice cream. 2/5  VIBE: It was extremely loud inside the restaurant and difficult to carry on a conversation. The music was on full blast and the place was packed. I was yelling, not talking. As for the window view, at first we were happy to have the view, but that soured when guys waiting in line to get into Omnia next door began tapping on the glass window and gesturing at us through the window. :/ 2/5   SERVICE: Perfect! Our plates were cleared away quickly and we were checked on frequently. 4.5/5  Worth a Return Visit? I'm interested in trying out the Happy Hour menu but don't see myself coming back for dinner. I'm hoping it will be less rambunctious earlier on in the day.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #176"}
{"text":"Located in Caesars', and opened by managing partner Hakkasan to coincide with nearby Omnia, celebrity chef Brian Malarkey's fourth (actually fifth if you count the shuttered Scottsdale experiment) Searsucker bills itself as New American Classic Cuisine, and although the ebb and flow of such restaurants in major Casinos has become a virtual game of 'who's who, and who's new' an early visit seemed perfectly suited to a nearby concert, myself and three friends sitting down at the end of the open kitchen away from the hustle of a three-deep bar.  Undoubtedly courting the cool kids from the nightclub nextdoor with all sorts of clever libations and a late night menu that goes until 3am, but surprisingly pulling a wide demographic despite loud music ranging from VAST to Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, it was with greetings from a server ported direct from the San Diego flagship that our dining began and with complimentary cheese puffs tinged in peppers whetting the palate it was not long until Chef JP Labadie stopped by to discuss the menu, a few of our desired items from the online version already culled as the kitchen ramps up to full speed.  Energetic, if not a little bit 'cramped,' with plenty of eye candy both on the walls and amongst the service staff it was with appetites gauged and questions answered that an order was formulated and requesting that items be sent out in trios so as not to overwhelm the service was nearly spotless from beginning to end, a high piece of praise in a city where such a thing is quite rare.  Starting with 'smalls' before progressing to greens, ocean, farms, 'and', and 'all milk + sugar,' it was in a trio of Malarkey's signatures that original opinions were formed and although the brie presented pasty and bland beneath the jam with a substantial delay for an extra piece of bread further marring the experience, no fault could be found in either the 'harlot' or the 'belly,' both of the expectedly rich proteins featuring great depth of flavor and textbook texture amidst accoutrements lent levity through the utilization of restrained herbs and spice.  Continuing the small plates it was once again a 'toast' that proved least impressive of round two, and although the burrata got lost amidst all the fungus and spongy bread just like the brie beneath strawberries both the Searsucker signature Shrimp and Grits as well as the Rocky Mountain Oysters were better than expected, the first for somehow finding a way to reinvent a dish done countless places as a spicy sort of cioppino while the second plated the lightly fried gonads with crispy greens and a tangy vinaigrette plus onion jam that was both smoky and sweet.  Taking a lighter approach, albeit only slightly, course three consisted of three plates focused around vegetables and although prior plates were good it was here that the first two 'stunners' arrived, the Strawberry salad a nice and refreshing share plate but the sweetbread salad and spicy pork-infused cream corn undoubtedly stealing all the thunder, the spinach beneath buttermilk and a poached egg with bacon selling itself like an gussied up Lyonnaise with the creamy bits of offal adding just enough funk to let you know they are there.  Onward to mains, savories concluded with a somewhat mixed bag, for as much as I commend the kitchen for serving the duck nearly rare I only wish the effort would have been rewarded by accoutrements that served to accent rather than overwhelm, a theme of sweetness and smoke also found in the braised Pork Butt and seared Mahi, though with far more restraint - the fish in particular perhaps the best of its kind with boozy cherries finding a deft dance partner in charred white flesh.  Unwilling and unable to forgo sweets, particularly at a place so routinely celebrated for its pastry program, it was with some restraint that I avoided requesting 'the lot,' but still investing heavily in 4/6 of the selections one would be hard pressed to name a single plate that failed to shine, even the seemingly overwrought sundae presenting a lovely blend of textures and flavors with more than enough to share while both the crostata and pumpkin cake were unassuming yet perfect, the heavy hitting S'mores bar a dish best shared, though so compelling as a result of the combination of honey, caramel, and chocolate that none will be left on the plate regardless of stomach capacity or party size.  Already functioning at a high level, and seemingly willing to take *some* chances without going 'all in,' Searsucker enters a market crowded with several similar restaurants and with longtime Las Vegas Chef Labadie at the helm an early look gives one hope that this won't just be another absentee landlord hotspot for pre-and-post-club noshing, a decision likely to be made by the powers that be in upcoming months as feedback and finances curate the cuisine."}
{"text":"This place was an awesome surprise. My husband and I stopped in for drinks, but the menu looked so great and the bar staff was awesome so we decided to stay for dinner. We split the happy hour sliders (ordered 2), the goat cheese salad (forgot the name), and the pasta. All were fantastic. We liked it so much that we went back later for dessert. We'll definitely be back.  Tip, eat at the bar during happy hour (4-7 PM)!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner before a show after reading many good reviews and we're not disappointed! The food was delicious and the wait staff was incredibly kind and knowledgeable about bith the menu and pairing options. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Staff needs an attitude adjustment. We we greeted with a bitchy face and no warm greeting. We made it in time for happy hour, but our server took so long to get to us that we couldn't order it. One of my friends had the tacos and got FOOD POISONING because of the very questionable meat. The prices are too high for the amount of food. And service wasn't helpful when one dish needed to be sent back. None of the staff was smiling. Except Curtis the busser. He was incredibly kind and sociable. He gave our table more attention than our server.  We felt judged being younger customers since we didn't buy alcohol, but we could still afford to pay and tip well... We never got our beverages refilled."}
{"text":"I had the roasted chicken here. It was well seasoned. The decor is great here. The service was great."}
{"text":"Very disappointing as I had been there for lunch and enjoyed the food.  Even was a disaster.  Bad service, food arrived cold, waiter could care less, ETC."}
{"text":"It seems they spent all of their money making the restaurant look great so couldn't spend anything on making the food great. Don't get me wrong... The food wasn't bad.  It just wasn't great.  There isn't anything that I thought, \"Yum\" after eating. Cheddar puffers = cheesy bread.  Tasty but needed to be softer. I had the Kobe beef carpaccio for a starter.  Beef and bacon sounds amazing...  a little too salty for me.  It was still ok.   My friend had the crab cake.  It was good.  Baked crab in the shape of a circle.  Nothing amazing about it other than it's called a crab cake and not breaded and fried. I had the chicken entree.  It was cooked well and juicy.  The franks is Frank's Red Hot sauce and there was hardly any on the plate.  In fact, I was halfway through it before I found just a little line of it on my plate.  Was the chicken cooked in it?  I'm not sure, but there wasn't enough to taste it with my dish. My friends ordered the butter potato side.  It reminded me of box mashed potatoes with a pound of butter melted into it.  Great for 3rd grade; but my palate has changed quite a bit in the last 20 years.  The service was great and my drinks were good.  The ideas for the food seem exciting, but what is served is pretty boring."}
{"text":"I cannot say how fantastic our experience was! We went for an early dinner on a Saturday night and the service was great. We ordered a couple of items I read reviews about on Yelp and they were AMAZING!  I had the eggs and bacon and let me tell you I would drive across town just to have that again and again and again!  We also ordered the short rib. Excellent.  My husband had the Pork Butt entree based on our waitress, Tammy's, recommendation. He was not disappointed!  The table next to us ordered the bone marrow. Apparently, a waiter in the Austin restaurant started a trend of pouring a shot of bourbon through the bone to get any remaining marrow. Keep that in mind if you order the bone marrow! Sounds fantastic.  Dessert was good too. Interesting though that as stellar as the entrees and small plates were the desserts weren't quite as outstanding (and I am a dessert fiend). However, Tammy did recommend the cookies and we opted for the s'mores and sundae. Again, they were very good, just not as outstanding as the other food. Tammy said that she bakes cookies at home and the cookies there are the best she's ever had. Definitely trying the cookies next time.  FYI - the music is loud and there are no soft surroundings. Be prepared for it to be noisy.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Searsucker was good but I had higher expectations for it, being inside a casino on the strip. The service was good but not excellent. What upset me the most were the drinks. I got a mixed drink and the proportions didn't seem right and tasted horrible. The other guests at my table ordered different mixed drinks and had the same result to the point where none of us finished our drinks. The food was actually tasty and well-made. I enjoyed the scallops and their version of the Mac and cheese. Would come back again to give it another chance on the drinks."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Service was good, not great but good.  We did the chefs recommended Apps for a table of 7, all of which were great!  Those were eaten quickly.  Entrees were pretty blah, seemed to be missing seasonings.  I would say check with place out for apps and a drink, I'd skip dinner.  They had Calvin Harris playing at the night club next to the restaurant so it was extremely loud and noisy right outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"went here for dinner one night and it was AMAZING! the service was great but the food was even better!!  we got the bone marrow, duck fat fries and some beer braised short ribs. it was literally like i died and went to heaven once i ate the bone marrow! it was so rich and sweet! the short ribs were so tender and melted in your mouth.. & you can never go wrong with duck fat fries ;)  would definitely recommend to anyone who is adventurous with food! i will be coming back when i'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was actually great we had some Habenero pickles to start off then we had blue cheese chicken skewers   Drinks were a little expensive but good"}
{"text":"Much better than I was expecting. The beer list included some interesting options. The bartenders were fun and lively and engaging. The crab and avocado appetizer was killer... big chunks of crab and fresh avocado and nice subtle spice. I wish they included more than 4 chips, but that would be my only complaint. The short rib entree was cooked perfectly and dwarfed the short rib I had at Gordan Ramsay's a couple nights prior. The portion was very generous. This is a strong contender."}
{"text":"Great addition to Caesars... Do not walk in w/out a reservation during meal times.  Beef tartare and biscuits were amazing, along with the short rib and desserts.  Only negatives were the service is hard to come by if eating at the bar and can be a little slow (but attentive). Once brought to our server's attention, Charles came over to help and he was an amazing server. The only other negative were the drinks were not strong.. which is sad because they tasted great!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Soup, appetizer, food all delicious. I am very picky person and don't give 5 Star easily. This place, ambiance,servers,kitchen all 5 stars. This is the one Of the best place for a dining."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last week and boy were we not disappointed.  The Pork Belly with egg is so yummy.  The chicken lollypops are a nice twist on a chicken wing.  Very flavorful.  The albacore with prosciutto was very nice.  A different twist on Tuna.  All the cocktails are great, but my favorite was the honey badger which was made with  rye and fresh lemon + honey syrup.  MMMMMMM"}
{"text":"A little pricey in my opinion for the food here. The servt and everything was fine, just the food was ok. The scallops I get were good, but not great   Also I hated the roasted cauliflower. Both my friend and I who ordered it barely ate ours. The seasoning was awful on it."}
{"text":"Not really a great place for vegetarians. I can usually find something pretty decent to eat at most restaurants. However, I was pretty disappointed with my menu options. The only entree was the quinoa dish which was basically a soggy mound of quinoa with a little bit of steamed spinach underneath, topped with a few shreds of raw carrots and some micro greens. The dish was very bland and disappointing for $23. The beet salad was pretty good. It had golden beet chunks with a creaming dressing. And there were these two little fried cheese balls that were a nice surprise! Overall, it had a Nice sweet flavor but was a very small portion. The best dish was the side of brussels spouts with walnuts. They were charred with balsamic, tangy and tender.   Service was average, and food was average as well. Nothing stood out about this experience that would warrant s repeat visit."}
{"text":"I always heard about the one in San Diego so I had to come in for the grand opening, let me tell you this is what vegas needed! Great food, drinks and service!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable Old Fashions!  We stopped here before seeing Celine at Caesar's and their world famous Old Fashions are incredible.  The food was fantastic and we had a great time.  Try the PB&J Old Fashion...it's their most popular drink."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Tasty. Great staff and service. So good to have this in CP."}
{"text":"I shared a couple of plates with my friends.  The short rib with mashed potatoes was the best dish out of all the ones we ordered.  If you are eating here, you have GOT to try it!"}
{"text":"Good service but food was AWFUL.  I called a week in advance to make a reservation for our big group (party of 25).  I was told that all big parties are required to order off their Banquet Menu.  I told the person on the phone that this was just a regular dinner (family from out of town) and she said it was ok to order off the regular dinner menu but our food would take longer to come out.  Not a problem with our group.  I called on the morning of our reservation and was told we were not on the system.  The manager, Beth, was very helpful and was able to accommodate us anyway but was once again reminded that our food will take longer to be served due to us having a big group.  When we got there, the general manager, Les, came to say Hi and was very nice.  Prior to ordering, we asked our waiter what are the other customers' favorites and his recommendations.  He told us the seared albacore tuna, shark, and Brussels sprouts for side.  So we did order those 3 items and they were HORRIBLE!  Tuna was not seared, it was OVERCOOKED!  Shark was OVERCOOKED and CHEWY like a rubber!  Brussels sprouts was SALTY!  We did expect a longer wait on our food but we did not expect it was going to be AWFUL.  And lastly, there were two COCKROACHES on the curtains that divided the private dining areas!  GROSS!  It was totally embarrassing to our out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good, but the menu wasnt specific as to what was included in each item. For example, my companion had a burger that had a little bit of a green spread on it. Turns out it was an avocado spread and she is allergic to avocados. The server was not very attentive as we had to track her down for the bill."}
{"text":"The BF went to Searsucker to celebrate our -1 monthaversary (ha) and because we had a living social deal. I must say, there were many great things about the night and other things that weren't so great. We pulled up to the restaurant, and they had valet, but it wasn't complimentary, so we decided to pull the car around to a self park area. I'm not sure why they even have a valet, especially on a weekday night when they aren't so busy. Anyway, that started the night oddly. Then, as the BF was parking, I went in to the restaurant and there was no one at the host stand. I waited for a few minutes before anyone came by. The place wasn't that busy....not awesome. Then, when the host did come he awkwardly asked me if I wanted to go to the bar while waiting for the BF instead of being seated.....so I did. The bar was nice and I got a peter rabbit drink on happy hour...it was really tasty. The BF got there almost immediately, so we sat at the bar for awhile and then asked to be seated again. For food we decided to share the chicken and waffle, the royale with cheese, and some bacon grits. Very healthy...ha. As we were waiting, we got some cheese poppers, which were ok. Not amazing, but not bad. All the food came out at the same time. The chicken and waffle was really good when it first came out, it was a little spicy and a little sweet, but really needed to be eaten right away, because it got soggy and not so good quickly. The burger was good and giant! It was like two patties with bacon between them. It came with a tomato jam, which was ok, but could have had more flavor, and also an onion jam, which was good. It also came with fries, which were ok, but not as crispy as I would like. The grits were good, but they came out cold. They were super indulgent, creamy and cheesy and bacony. If they were hot, they would be a real winner. So everything was pretty good up until this point, so we decided to get dessert. We got the chocolate terrine. It was a huge disappointment....it was bland and didn't have the espresso kick I thought it would have. The ice cream it came with was good. Anyway, it wouldn't be a place I would frequent because the flavor and experience didn't live up to the price. I would suggest going here, maybe for happy hour."}

{"text":"This is a must if you are going to Vegas. The delivery was flawless both in the service and the food. We started with Beef Tartare & Sourdough, Hummus & Toasted Pita, Biscuits and Calamari Steak. For three that was a ton of food. The Tartare was a huge portion and wonderful taste, the Hummus was perhaps the least exciting offering but still good. The biscuits were to die for and you have to use the infused honey, you'll want a bowl! The calamari was served in steak finger fashion rather than old boring rings and again the sauce was excellent. We then ordered a filet, short ribs and fish and chips. The fish and chips get served as part of an art deco arrangement of the whole real fish, very impressive. The short ribs were so soft you could have cut them with your napkin and the filet was cooked perfectly. I warn you every dish came out piping hot, get your drink ready. You will have an unbelievable visit!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of coming here one night after Seeing NERVO play at Omnia Nightclub. I didn't even know they had late night. One of the Cocktail server assistants told me about it while we were in Omnia. It had to have been around 3:30am or so. Pretty awesome how the place stays open late when the club is going on. We hurried up and ordered the chicken & waffles as we heard they were amazing! Service staff is on point! Our server Steve was highly knowledgeable about the food and also vouched for the said Chicken & waffles. They were indeed worthy of the hype surrounding them, haha! Food was brought out quick! Matt (food runner guy) asked if we needed anything and made sure we got al we needed to devour the luscious food (I said luscious). I would highly recommend coming here again and we probably will come by during normal dinner time as well. Food was awesome as well as the service. Now you guys know where to head after going to OMNIA!!! Ha!   (Sorry no pics, I lost my phone before the night ended)"}
{"text":"Sorry but, I will never eat there again! Not that the food was terrible, but just over priced. Service was lacking and the food was weak. Everything was spicy, which was ok for me but not my mother. She could not even get mustard for her 26$ hamburger, and there is something wrong with that."}
{"text":"Came here based on a mix of Yelp pictures and their menu offerings. Our Party of 9 had an 8pm reservation and was seated promptly. I was actually surprised the place was only half full and felt a little concerned I made a poor choice in restaurant especially since it was on the expensive side. However, it turned out I had nothing to worry about.  I split the Chicken Cobb salad and Mac n Cheese with a friend and both were super delicious. Especially the Mac n Cheese. And the portions were surprisingly large we couldn't finish either. Also tried their Habanero & coriander pickles which were free with Yelp check in and as strange as they sounds they were actually really good.   it wasn't happy hour but they had 2 drink specials going for the night. A cosmo and a \"bay breeze\" which was basically vodka and tropical juices. It was tasty and on the strong side for only $8/ I came in expecting to spend over $100 but between the drink specials and portions large enough to split I managed to come in under $60, so just know this place doesn't HAVE to break your wallet. It's also right next to Omnia so well placed for pre-turnup meal and drinks. I will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Interested to see that the only menu they offered was the Restaurant week offerings. Not sure if this was supposed to be the case, but OK. Appetizers were the best course. I had the calamari which were by far the best I'd ever had. Husband had the short rib which was also good but not as good as the calamari. My entree was Filet with lobster butter. When it came out the butter was still a frozen disk on top of the meat - eew! Fortunataly manager came over and corrected this problem, but stated when he came back -\" we usually serve it cold on top\" - what? Husband had the seared ahi tuna which had no flavor whatsoever. Desserts were also just meh.  Does no one make real chocolate mousse anymore as opposed to a blob of frosting-like chocolate covered in ganache?   Might try again with regular menu, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"So, funny thing....I have recommended Searsucker San Diego to many friends, who have loved it. But I have yet to go myself! So, when a location opened in Vegas, I knew I had to check it out.  First things first - park in the Forum shops valet or self parking, both are convenient to the restaurant.   The restaurant was easy to find. If you continue past the sports book and poker room, you'll see Omnia and Searsucker is just next door to that.   Note that they are only open for dinner (currently - not sure if that will change). They do offer a decent happy hour menu Monday - Friday.  The décor is very rustic and warm. When you enter, there is a large bar area with booths and seating. I was surprised at the size of the restaurant. While not small, it was smaller than I expected (in a good way). I love the open kitchen concept and that there is actually seating at the counter.  Here's what we had for food:  Duck fat fries with chipotle ketchup ($10) - REALLY good. Do yourself a favor and order these.  Shisito + ponzu ($7) - They say about 1 in every 10 is really hot, so be careful! I got a hot one and survived, but I love spicy stuff. There was tremendous flavor on the peppers and I'm glad I tried them.  Egg + Bacon \"pork belly\" ($19) - This was tasty as well, although the bacon was a bit too thick cut (IMO).  Cowboy Caviar ($11) - I've had Rocky Mountain Oysters before (at Coors Field) and swore to never try them again. Although, they were not properly prepared there and these were PHENOMENAL! Really, really good. You would have a hard time believing that this wasn't a fancy chicken nugget.  Shrimp \"spicy\" + Bacon grits ($17) - Delicious! I am not a huge fan of grits, but these were well made. The spicy shrimp was really delicious and basically the star of the dish though.  Beet salad ($16) - I've had an obsession with beets lately. This was really good and I especially enjoyed the fried goat cheese.  I would say that it's best to get a bunch of plates and share. The main entrees are on the high end, pricing wise. We were all happy with the smaller plates.  We also had a couple of signature cocktails, which were good. The beer list was decent, but nothing spectacular, which is a bit disappointing for a restaurant based in San Diego.  They will be offering a late night menu, on the nights that Omnia is open. I would expect this place to be a total shit show on those nights! The staff were all super friendly and knowledgeable, and Chef Malarkey was quite nice as well. I look forward to going back soon for a visit and trying some of the things we didn't get to try this time!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in Las Vegas.  Specialty drinks were tasty and not bad price for the Strip.  Crab Cakes are the absolute best I have ever had and a must try!   We also had the steak tartare & pork butt both very good. The Chefs use of sauces and flavor combinations are wonderful!  Our waiter Chris was great as well as the rest of the wait staff that assisted. a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  I recommend ordering tapas style to try many dishes.  We all got to try so much more this way. Loved the braised short rib, ceviche, mac n cheese. All incredible.  Didn't save room for hot chocolate chip cookies and milk, but ordered them anyway. No regrets! Service was excellent, but rarely saw anyone smile. That was the only thing missing.  I highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try one of the newest restaurants in Las Vegas and it did not disappoint! Great atmosphere, amazing menu selection, spectacular food! This restaurant is a MUST TRY! And request Lindsey...she, by far, was the best server I've ever had...very knowledgeable about the menu, attentive to our needs, and pushed this great dining experience over the top!!!"}
{"text":"Seersucker is a great place to find an interesting and yet accessible meal on the strip and in Caesars palace. This place has some awesome staff and a great bar team that takes care of the patrons across the restaurant. They have some cool and tasty signature and craft cocktails that are certainly worth a try (or two, or three!) The food is well prepared and very well presented - they put their time into the dishes and make sure that it's done to your liking. The pricing is a bit high, but for an on-the-strip option is a great choice and well worth return visits. Happy hour is great and you can get some nice deals too - so keep an eye out! All in all this is a win win for me!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and the cocktails. Chef Malarkey & Hakkasan Group have really done a great job  taking a see and be seen San Diego \"locals restaurant\" and turning it into a viable global brand."}
{"text":"We were sat promptly and the hostess was very nice.  Then we waited and waited.  Finally a server showed up.  He was very nice.  We ordered drink and they were good.  We then ordered appetizers and they were expensive and TINY.  I know that appetizers can be small, but they were smaller than I have ever seen.  The server was not attentive, never checked in on us.  We constantly had to ask the bus boy to get him.  The sliders were 2 tiny burgers and were tasty,  the ahi tacos were the size of those deep friend mini tacos from the frozen section at the store.  They were just ok.  The Ceviche was good also.  The guy who filled the water glasses was fantastic.  We drank a lot of water since we had to wait so long for drinks."}
{"text":"I have had dinner and drinks here with my husband a few times and loved it so much that I decided to host an event there recently.  The staff went above and beyond to make sure the party was a success and the food was unbelievable!  We had a brunch and it was to die for, especially the chef's special maple bacon!!!  I highly recommend this venue for anything from cocktails with the girls to a large event!"}
{"text":"Great food, small portions, bad service."}
{"text":"Top notch food  Relaxed but upscale atmosphere Friendly, knowledgeable waitstaff  Jenn took me to Searsucker for my most recent Birthday dinner. We enjoyed sharing several offerings starting with the Blackened Ahi Tacos- small but packed with flavor. Next was the Calamari Steak with Chili Honey Glaze and Apples- strongly recommended by our server-- thank goodness. This is NOT typical fried Calamari O's you could get at any ordinary chain place. No no no!! Think more of the difference in canned tuna and real fresh Ahi= yes now you get it! The Calamari Steak will change your life-- or at least your expectations of seafood for bit. Lastly we shared The Braised Pork Butt Entree- a tower of flavor power! So melt in your mouth type tender. Whiskey Apples, Brussels Sprouts and Prosciutto round out the experience.  Also worth mention is the wide variety of hand crafted cocktails- especially the Jaleberry Strawpeno-- tequila with fruit and heat."}
{"text":"Ok, here is my update for a recent visit. They have changed chefs from our Meet up, and have also adjusted the menu, taking away my favorite Pork Belly Benedict which I send people here to try. Also gone, my Ballerina and the Czar cocktail. This makes me sad. :(  I had the eggs and bacon, and also the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. The eggs and bacon was disappointing, the pork belly here was so dry and crunchy that it was almost inedible. The grilled cheese and tomato basil was pretty good.   This is one of my pet peeves with restaurants, and that's taking good items off the menu. I'm sure there are numbers that say this wasn't selling or whatever. Looking over this menu, I really didn't see much that I enjoyed from our Yelp event left. I was definitely disappointed with the selections.   Alas, I won't be back nor recommending it again. I'm sure people will still enjoy what they have to offer, and they have a great location. Time to find a new Strip restaurant to enjoy and take guests from out of town to."}
{"text":"I was invited by Brain Malarkey for his hospitality event, I had such a great time! The food the drinks the atmosphere was just great, he was very involved and answered all our questions, I had a little sample of the small eats such as duck fat fries and chipotle ketchup , shishito peppers, cheese and meats, eggs and pork belly and shrimp and grits... All was very flavorful and my favorite was the cowboy caviar!!! Aka BULLS BALLS lol... Best tasting balls ever! Also I had the Chardonnay it was very smooth... I had the Peter rabbit and jalaberry strawpeno!!!! I'm definitely going back for my 1 year wedding anniversary and my 30th birthday!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and great decor inside. Hanger steak was awesome and the whipped potatoes were delicious. Biscuits I could take a whole batch home if you like sweet honey biscuits."}
{"text":"You need to try this place and if you have go back!!  The staff was great. Eric was our waiter and was spot on. Had the opportunity to meet nick, asst GM, was a pleasure. Really s class operation. The food was great. Crab cake is straight crab meat.  The calamari steak with apple I wanted all to myself. We had other dishes and I enjoyed a Peter rabbit drink.  Best part of the night, milk and cookies. Can't wait to bring more clients and friends back. My go to for Caesars!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The service is great and the food is outstanding! The cheese puffers they bring in the beginning are delectable and a perfect introduction to the food. I had the tuna and it was cooked perfectly, the grapes provided the perfect balance of acidity.  My friend had one of the steaks and I tried a little, it was amazing, totally melt in your mouth delicious.  For sides we had the corn, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts.  This was my first time having brussel sprouts and I have no idea why people don't like them...they were absolutely divine, and I want to try them everywhere now.  The corn was perfect and a little spicy.  The mashed potatoes were really creamy and delicious.  For dessert we had the donuts and chocolate which was a perfect ending to our meal, little bite size pieces of heaven dipped in chocolate.  The drinks were also very good, I had the cocktail on draft which was a rum based drink...it came to the table on fire, which is awesome.  I recommend getting this when it's darker to get the full effect.  It wasn't dark when I got it, so the flame was hard to see.  Mostly, I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We selected this restaurant for our party of 6 based on the reviews and food selection. We wanted something a little different, and the selections and review pictures looked quite interesting. It was an early dinner by Vegas standard, around 7pm. Hostess was wonderfully friendly and promptly seated us.   The dinner started with an introduction from our server, Cesar.  He was really great from beginning to end.  We really enjoyed his friendliness and appreciated his attentive service. We wanted to have some fun during dinner, and Cesar played right along!  The entire service was great, perfectly timed and we were well attended the entire time.   We chose a few share plates; Tomato and Burata (super delish), short ribs (succulent and tasty), and the duck fat fries (nicely seasoned and presented).  For our main courses most had the hanger steak.  It was perfectly cooked and tasted great. One word of caution: You better love garlic, like I do!  One person in our party had the burger, which she said was \"amazing\", and another had the Salmon (perfectly cooked).  As if that wasn't enough, we finished off with the awesomely decadent ice cream sandwich. Man, the flavors there were unbelievable.   All in all, we each enjoyed the food and Cesar's excellent service.  We'd all recommend the place for a slightly different take on American classics."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed during my visit.  I would somewhat consider myself a \"foodie\" and will spend some cash on a GOOD MEAL.  Searsucker was anything but.   In hindsight, I wish I had walked across the street to City Hall Steakhouse.  I could have had a delicious meal for the same price.  My friend's order of duck came out cold and after she sent it back, it returned cold again.  The waiter didn't check to make sure it was better, we had to flag him down to acknowledge us.  Another fellow diner ordered the shark which the server raved about.  Plain and simple, it wasn't good and the portion size was terribly small for a $38 plate.  I had the Mahi Mahi.  It stated it had a horseradish crust however, I found it to be lacking flavor and was quite dry.  A side of potatoes was ordered and they weren't cooked.  The best part of the dinner was the end when the table next to us looked over and said \"looks like your food was as bad as ours.\"  They too, were not impressed.  I really wanted to like Searsucker but it was not worth our $260 tab.  I do think the restaurant has potential but it would take me some serious convincing to return."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Searsuckers and each time the good was excellent.   The fish and chips are some of the best we've ever had. The mac and cheese is superbly made and the lollipop buffalo chicken wings are finger licking good. We ordered multiple items, all were very good.   Dessert is great too, we ordered the rocky road bread pudding and the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"The appetizers were delicious. I had the buffalo wings and calamari, not disappointed. My meal was the skirt steak. It was a little salty, but the chimichurri was good. I would definitely recommend this place for its bar environment. It was a very social scene and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"I tried Searsucker with a group for a friend's birthday.... This was a great experience cause we got to try a variety of items! For my cocktail I chose the Jalaberry Strawpeno - which is a strawberry jalapeno tequila + lime + agave. This was a great mix of spicy and sweet! For appetizers we shared the cheddar puffers, mussels + chorizo + beer, brie \"triple\" + cranberry jam, \"cowboy caviar\" and the shrimp \"spicy\" + bacon grits.  I have to say that my favorites were the mussels and the shrimp with the grits! YUMM! For my entrée I chose the scallops \"east coast\" israeli couscous + almonds + citrus vinaigrette- this was fabulous! We then shared a variety of desserts- I have to say my favorite was the warm cookies with milk.  I absolutely enjoyed the entire experience at Searsucker! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been putting off writing this review since I was such a big fan of the restaurant in Scottsdale (which is now closed) but unfortunately my experience at the Vegas location was not a good one. A big issue was the staff; everyone from the hostess to the bussers seemed to not want to be there. Our server was very short with us while ordering and never really came back after that. Another dude brought us our food and he wasn't very friendly either. I burnt my hand pretty badly (it bubbled into a blister the next day) on one of the metal dishes they serve the food (straight from the oven?!?!) in and it took us forever to find someone to give us some ice since our water glasses were never even refilled.  The food was a disappointment as well. The menu was probably half the size of the AZ location so there wasn't much variety. Since it was late we decided on a few small plates to share. We got the corn (cooked well but very bland), the Mac and Cheese (really awful... the sauce was white and curdled) and also the small fried blobs they tried to pass off as tacos.  The decor in the place was nice but it was loud since it is open to the casino and also very dark for some unknown reason. Just not a pleasant experience. There are other better and cheaper places to go in Caesars so I will not be back."}
{"text":"Review is for happy hour at the bar.  I can't believe this is my first time back here since the YEE two years ago! We were seeing a show at the Colosseum and came a little early for some appetizers and drinks. It was surprisingly not busy for a Sunday night so we grabbed a seat at one of the hightops in the bar area. Our server Emily was right over to go over the HH menu and take our drink order.   HH at Searsucker has some great deals. All food is $9 and drinks are $4-8 depending on if you order beer, wine or cocktails. I had the house chardonnay for $6 and it wasn't bad. We ordered the duck fat fries, lollipop wings, sliders and ahi tacos.   The food starting arriving very quickly. The ahi tacos (3) came out first and they were fantastic. The ahi was super fresh and served in a wonton shell with limes and guac on the side. Next out was the lollipop wings. 9 wings covered in buffalo sauce served with blue cheese, carrots and celery. Another excellent dish. The fries and sliders arrived last. The fries were hot, fresh and crispy. Dusted with prosciutto and parmesan they were a perfect match for the sliders.   Although the sliders were our least favorite of the four apps, they were still good. Slightly over cooked and quite small but the flavors were good. Debating on getting another order of the ahi tacos the dessert menu was brought out. As soon as I saw the rocky road bread pudding I knew I couldn't pass it up!   The bread pudding was delivered with the marshmallows still on fire, melting on top of the chocolate bread pudding. With a side of fresh whipped cream and chocolate gelato this was an outstanding dessert that we quickly polished off. The food and service here is as good as when it opened two years ago and Im glad we came back."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. I've been to the Searsucker in San Diego.  First of all, I expect good service.  After being seated, no one came to our table for literally 15+ minutes. I had to flag someone down, and although she wasn't out waiter, she apologized and gladly took our drink order.  Wish she had remained our waitress. Peter Rabbit cocktail was tasty.  Got a bunch of small plates: eggs +bacon, chicken &waffles, and shrimp + grits, and side of brussel sprouts.  The plates were interesting in concept, were good, but nothing great.  Brussel sprouts were the most flavorful thing we got.  Atmosphere is kind of weird in the bottom of an office building and they charge $5 for parking.  Between the service and food, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Wanted a small bite so split the lollipop wings and tomato soup with grilled cheese. The wings were okay but the tomato soup was stellar, lots of flavor and that grilled cheese was the best I have EVER had. Service was great and food came out fast. I love the interior decor and all the different light fixtures especially the chandelier in the black cage. Really cool place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lots of good small plates here - the goat cheese toast and calamari were great.  Wait staff was helpful and allowed us to order bit by bit so we could try several things without over ordering as small plates can sometimes be tough to judge. Tried the p, b & j old fashion, pretty good!  Mule was the hit drink of the night.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loud. Couldn't hear the people we were with. Food. Meh. Service was strange. In a hurry to give us our check when we were ordering everything on the menu!!! We weren't campers! We were spending lots of money! We all agreed we would never be going back to Searsucker. Also, our friend Jim is no longer allowed to pick restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice stop for a pre-show bite! I thought it was located in the forum shops but it's in the casino. Service was friendly though a little slow - but it was pretty packed, probably due to the concert. They have a great happy hour - my husband got dogfish head on tap and I ordered the blueberry smash cocktail. We were running low on time so we ordered the lollipop chicken wings and tomatoe burrata. Both were tasty and a deal for the price! Next time we're gonna try the fries - we would definitely return to try their full menu."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Friday evening just a few days after they opened and Searsucker already had a decent amount of people seated, enjoying their food.  We were seated in an awkward table in a walkway on the way to the restroom so my chair got kicked and bumped on a number of occasions. If I were to return I would ask for a more secluded table.  I had the pleasure of enjoying a meal with several dining companions which gave us a chance to order and sample a number of items from the menu.  For a new restaurant service already seemed on point, but that may just have been our good fortune to get the only server in the restaurant that came over from the Searsucker location in San Diego. He was knowledgable, friendly and very attentive.   Our plates came out in a well-balanced manner. Never inundating us with too much food so we were able to sample at a leisurely pace.  My favorites from the evening were the mahi, pork butt, egg and pork belly and surprisingly the strawberry salad. Each of these dishes were well-cooked and the flavors were on point.   The rest of the food was good, but didn't leave a lasting impression with me. I love brussel sprouts but these weren't as crispy as I like and seemed drowned in garlic, not really allowing me to enjoy the flavor of the vegetable. I was in the minority in my opinion of this dish, so it might just be a personal preference.   Of the desserts we sampled, the smores dish came out as a table favorite. Even I, who am neither a huge fan of chocolate or smores, enjoyed it, though I couldn't take more than a bite since it was rich. This dish is best shared. The rest of the desserts didn't really do as much for me, but they were decent. Again, I was in the minority on this opinion, so it may be due to my lack of sweet tooth.   Searsucker is already ahead of the game after opening so recently. Good service, excellent location and decent food to boot. With their eclectic menu and late night availability I see them being successful in catering to the pre-show and after clubbing crowd quite well."}
{"text":"This restaurant owned/created by celebrity chef Brian Malarkey is just awesome!  I have been there twice on lunch at both time where great with good service and nice tatsting food for an affordable price   *Pulled pork sandwich is served with an amazing apple slaw and baconaise.  Really juicy and supertasty. Price around 11 $ (its a lot of food!)   *Mahi mahi sandwich with bacon and avocaod.  Almost as good as the pulled pork this little sandwich of goodness had flavorful blackened mahi mahi that went good with the salty bacon, again the famous baconaise and the creamy avocado.   My inside tip is to order the Cheddar Puffers (2 $). This was 5 fluffy and cheasy delicious small breadpuffers that was oooh so good! Order them now, thank me later! = )"}
{"text":"Shared the loin filet, salmon, shark, duck, duck fat fries and squid. Everything was very tasty with great flavor. The duck fat fries and squid appetizers were a great start, the duck and filet were outstanding as entrees. Great presentation of dishes.  Service was unbelievable slow considering it was on a Wednesday night with not many people dining.  The biggest question is the extremely high prices of the entire meal.  The portions are small and the prices are through the roof.  For overall food quality, I would give this place 5 stars, price would be 2 stars and service would be 2 stars"}
{"text":"Probably my 10th time eating dining here......Service can be on the slower side, but the food is always consistent.  The tomato soup and grilled cheese is my absolute favorite and now they are doing it table side. It's a big enough meal to not need anything else!! Tonight we tried their newest \"melon tomato shrimp\" salad. Amazing! Yellow watermelon, yellow and red heirloom tomatoes (a little skimpy on the shrimp-only 3 and for 24$), but a total must try!  They also offer an expedited Omnia nightclub entry when you spend 50$ on dinner which is pretty enticing if your looking to head there."}
