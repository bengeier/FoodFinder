{"text":"My boyfriend suggested going here and I'm glad we did.  The food was really good!  I keep asking to go again but alas we have not.  It's kind of a long drive from where he lives so..."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident. 

Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good. 

The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming. 

At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals. 

I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken."}
{"text":"After returning from my tour in Iraq i sometimes have a nitch for good Iraqi food. i descovered this place by chance after dropping off a friend before heading home. I pulled into the parking lot not expecting much from a place called baghdad restaurant in Arizona, but what the heck right? 

So i walk in and take a quick look around, I can easily tell it was at one point a mexican food restaurant. I ordered the kabobs and rice and grabbed a coke. the owner was very nice, and he chatted for nearly and hour about Iraqi politics and how he likes what America is doing there... now at this point i had been home from iraq for only two weeks so i was still a little jumpy and expected to hear gun shots headed my way any moment, but I enjoyed a great meal (under $10) and a great conversation. The food was not much diffrent that that i experianced in iraq.... also when i last visited the menus where in english"}
{"text":"Some nights, when you're completely delirious after switching back and forth from every application in the Microsoft Office suite for 13 straight hours, you make some interesting decisions. Like deciding that, instead of driving straight home and making yourself a peanut butter & jelly sandwich, that now's the best time to head into west Phoenix to try someplace new to eat.

Which brings me to Baghdad.

The mini-shopping center that Baghdad Restaurant is in (which also includes a Jamaican restaurant *note to self*, a Mexican hair salon, and a Middle Eastern market called Babylon) is not going to convince you otherwise about your preconceived notions of west Phoenix. It's a fairly decrepit place. It doesn't feel 100% safe. Your only hint while driving down Camelback that Baghdad might be located here is the half-broken street sign with some Arabic on it. But I'm already here. I'm delirious. And starving.

I walk in. 

It's a pretty small establishment. Nowhere near the fanciest place you'll ever walk into. Photographs of monuments around Baghdad hang on the wall. The TV tuned to an Iraqi satellite channel. The owner talking to his friends.

My eyes dart back and forth, looking for a menu. I don't see any. At the counter, though, I see one: a menu which photographically depicts each dish. However, everything is written in Arabic. I look for an English version, but I don't see any. When the owner asks me what I want to eat, I look at the menu and point.

\"Oh, you want rice and chicken, yes?\"

\"Yes.\" [thought bubble] I could have said \"I'd like rice & chicken\" instead of just pointing as if I was mute. Anyway. [/thought bubble]

As he goes into the back to prepare the food, I watch Iraqi politicians yelling at each other in parliament on TV. As I debate in my head which specific issue they're yelling about at this instance, or whether their yelling is an umbrella, catch-all yell, the owner comes back with my to-go order. He apologizes that he didn't have enough rice since it was the end of the evening and so he gives me a discount. I was expecting one container of food in the plastic bag. But I see three. Odd. My total comes to $8-something.

I pay him and thank him and drive back across the I-17 to go home to eat. At my dining table, I open one container to see its full of white bean soup with a tomato base. I had no idea this even came with my order, but talk about a bonus. Taste? Excellent. Rich but not heavy. I then open a smaller container to see its full of salad - shredded romaine lettuce (bonus point for not being iceberg), slicked pickle spears, onions, lime wedges, tomatoes. Then the large container: kebab pieces of marinated grilled chicken over a bed of golden broth-cooked basmati rice. I wouldn't have even noticed that there was less rice than usual, because there was still quite a lot. And the rice was excellent - simple and plain yet really tasty - and went well with the chicken. I was completely full and very much satisfied by the end of my meal. What a value this little ramshackle restaurant on the sketchy west side gives you for your money. Maybe I should be delirious more often.

4 stars (for the food and the service)."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon I dragged one of my friends along with me to check this place out.  After reading Mr. K's review down below, I'd have to say nothing has really changed because I had generally the same experience.  No one wants to read the same review twice so I will keep it short.  

A few things:
-The rice was sprinkled with cinnamon.  I've never experienced such a thing and didn't enjoy it.
-The decor is ridiculously tacky.
-The credit card machine was not working, and he didn't mention this to us, so we had to run across the way to QT to get some cash.  He didn't seem very worried that we would not return, and was apologetic so I wasn't really mad.  It was a pretty hilarious situation.  When we both came back with $20's, he was afraid he didn't have the change for us.  

If you are wanting something a little different and in the West Valley (and not in a huge hurry), you should check this spot out.  It appears as if it is a one-man run business and Yelpers seem to love the mom and pops, so check it out!  Bring cash just in case!"}
