{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Cleveland. Great service. We frequent here a couple times per month."}
{"text":"It's always a treat to stop here. The menu seems a little limited, but what comes out of the kitchen is outstanding. Start off with the fresh bread and oil. Then I moved on to the Zucchini Planks with 2 different dips. The Chicken Sorrento was absolutely outstanding. Veggies, Chicken, and penne in a light sauce. Great service too. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"My parents and I have been loyal patrons of this restaurant for years. We love the food and have dined here around 30 times--celebrating birthdays, toasting anniversaries, and spending evenings with friends.

On Sunday, September 14, we came in for dinner. This was our last dinner together before I left to start a new job in Spain--so clearly this was an important occasion for us. This turned out to be a huge mistake.

All of the great times we have had here were spoiled by a truly awful experience.

The service was absolutely horrible. While the food was good as always, it just couldn't make up for the treatment we received. This is the first time we have ever been to a restaurant where the waitress abandoned the table--never to come back! The waitress forgot our appetizer; we understand that this happens sometimes--not a big deal. By the time she remembered, we told her to skip it, as we were receiving our entrees at that point. We weren't rude or even angry; we just didn't want the appetizer anymore. She came back to the table with the cheese, and that was the last time we saw her!

Another woman brought our bread (also forgotten) halfway into our entrees. Then, when we finished our meal, we sat and waited--until finally, yet another woman came over and asked if we needed anything. We asked what had happened to our first waitress and were told--much to our confusion--said that she was \"upset\" that she had forgotten our appetizer and wouldn't be back! The woman mentioned something along the lines of \"well, that's how young people are.\" Really? Wouldn't it have been more appropriate to make up for the (minor!) mishap and step up the service, like at least checking to see that our entrees were good? Instead, the level of service took a nose-dive!

We asked to speak to a manager (who also happens to be the owner of the restaurant), and the woman went to check. Upon her return, imagine our surprise when she said that the manager was aware of the situation, but couldn't leave the kitchen and refused to see us!  (Note that there was almost no one else in the restaurant--I can't imagine the kitchen was that busy.)

We are dumbfounded and disgusted by the lack of respect we received as customers at this restaurant. Because the restaurant offered no apology and no remedy to the situation, a small mistake snowballed into the most appalling service we have ever received.

We love the food, but we can get good food anywhere. An integral part of going to a restaurant is the service, and it is completely lacking here. For that reason, we won't be coming back. Maybe Eddie should learn a thing or two about customer service.

EDIT: After posting this review, I received this comment from Eddie: \"Wow....been there 30 previous time with great results and no yelp reviews. One bad experience and you blast us on yelp. There is a word for that...unbelievable!\" One bad experience was not the issue, Eddie. It was the complete lack of respect for your customers, a complete lack of intelligence on how to run a business in the service industry, and the complete lack of knowledge to know that to make it in this business, you apologize for mistakes made on the part of your restaurant. You have nothing but furthered my point that you have absolutely no respect for your patrons. That is the reason we will never be back."}
{"text":"I want to give four thumbs up to Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino because my wife and I have the same opinion of the place, the food, the staff, the pricing, etc. Now I won't give a 5-star rating to any restaurant because I think there's always room for improvement. In the case of Eddie's I would like to see their participation in some kind of restaurant.com or Dollar Stretcher coupon program. My wife and I don't dine out often but this place is definitely on our Top 5 places, probably in the 1 or 2 spot. 

I have to rave about the Italian Wedding Soup. I would be happy to just go there for the soup and a salad or appetizer. But, the pizza is very good so my wife and I will share that. Our usual bill is around $30 with tip which isn't bad for two diners that don't go out frequently. Neither of us are drinkers or I would assume the bill could easily double. 

The atmosphere is awesome. I don't think I have seen the place without a waiting line but that's a good sign. On our first visit I asked another person if she knew that it was worth the wait to which she smiled. \"This is my fourth visit ... Yes, it's definitely worth the wait!\" ... I don't know if she's a fellow yelper but her recommendation / review was spot on. We were delighted and we've returned and will continue to return. We were floored that while we had to wait a little while to be seated, the service was prompt and courteous beyond our belief. Thumbs up, Eddie!!!

The dessert menu is awesome; however, due to cost and the fact that I am diabetic we refrain. 

Looking for a place to go? Check out Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and very glad we did! The staff was friendly and attentive. The ambience was great. The pizzas were superb! Definitely will come back!"}

Wonderful menu,even found W W approved food.

{"text":"This is where I go when I want my favorite cheese ravioli! I don't know if they are fried or just sauteed with some breadcrumbs but they come in a delicious asiago cream sauce, topped off with a ribbon of the marinara sauce. They are fantastic!! This past weekend I tried the veal ravioli and while good I like the cheese ravioli much more. My husband loves the pasta bolognese and I have had the eggplant parmesan which is also delicious. The warm bread they bring to the table is great. I gave it 4 stars only because the ravioli is $16 (7 ravioli and that's the full order) and you get nothing with it, no soup, salad, or veggie but the flavor is superb!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious fresh salads and pizzas. The atmosphere is really nice and the food is great. So glad we have a great pizza restaurant on the south side."}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through the area for a vacation and had a craving for pizzeria pizza. We found this one had great Yelp reviews and went. The free bread was great! I had the rustica (a margherita pizza with pepperoni & Italian sausage). I was amazing! I couldn't decided between a margherita and pepperoni so this was an amazing combo. My husband got the Dante's Inferno and loved it as well. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to refill our water. Would return again if we're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"The bread was very good..got the deluxe pizza and it also was good. There was a lot of help on jand . it may have been that we are there before they dinner rush..total time there was nearly an hr and never very busy"}
{"text":"Went there tonight. I must say, after the disaster of last night, I wasn't expecting much from Cleveland. Tonight, I had two fellow big boys with big stomachs joining me. 

First, the place was spotless. Very clean, very bright, very old/modern look. I know they haven't been open long but it looks like they're going in the right direction. We sat on the side wit the bar which was okay. The other half is more bustling but it was perfect as I was dead tired.

Bread = I never rate bread but this bread was friggin' awesome! A bit oily but that's a great thing. Plain bread that actually had taste.

Calamari = As you can tell, I love calamari. These are obviously store breaded and they were really good. Not the best I've ever had but far from the worst. They had the distinction of being mixed with red peppers and sliced olives so whatever points I would take away from not being the best ever, they pretty much gained back. The marinara sauce that came with them though WAS the BEST EVER. Just an old fashioned Italian style tomato sauce. Friggin' and f---en awesome!

Fried zuchini sticks = BEST EVER! Just right, breaded in-store and not too greasy even though they were deep fried. Same marinara sauce accompaniment and some other sauce that was okay, whatever it was.

Mussels = I didn't try as I have plenty of my own ( I know, I know, muscles) and I don't really like eating ocean boogers. The two guys I were with happened to be seafood vendors and gave these 3 out of 4 thumbs up and said the broth they came in was awesome.

Pizza = Shared by the 3, double pepperoni, sausage. Dough was fantastic, pepperoni was meh and sausage, though good, was barely there. The sauce seemed to be the same marinara sauce. Great for dip, not so much for pizza. When you need to put salt and pepper on a pizza for taste, there's something wrong. Pizza was a huge miss.

Spaghetti & tomato sauce with meat balls, half portion (mine) = Friggin' awesome. Same marinara sauce, perfectly cooked pasta with a giant velvety meatball. All that was wrong with the pizza, you are forgiven.

Veal parmigiana = HUGE portion and the guy said it was really good.

Lemon chicken = Another HUGE portion and he said it wass great as well. 3 out of 4 thumbs up again.

Cannoli = Not tried by me but the two others said it had no sugar or taste. It was also filled in nicely on the ends but was empty in the middle. Hmmmmm, not nice, not nice.

Overall, I would much rather eat out the garbage can of this place than eat at a table at Mad Greek. I give this place 2 thumbs and a few other appendages up. I would give it 5 stars if not for the fogettable, journeyman pizza. 

4.5 with a bullet"}
{"text":"We love Cerino's! Our family favorites are the baked ravioli (so good) and rustica pizza. It does feel a tad pricey, but the portion size is hearty and you can taste the quality ingredients. Service is always good. It's a favorite to take family to when they're in town."}
{"text":"yum!  awesome food!  the marinara sauce is delicious.  nice atmosphere as well.  not huge portions for the price, and the beer is very expensive, otherwise would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"An absolute gem of a place in Seven Hills! Set back from Broadview Rd the corner unit shines clean and new. Once inside you're greeted with an ambient ands warm dining room, exposed ceiling rafters and vents, and floor to ceiling wine rack. Off to your left is the bar with more wine and spirits.

The exposed brick wall, warm woods, and earthy colors are very comforting to be surrounded by during your meal. The staff is great, out front, and genuinely friendly. They interacted well with the table and engaged my 22 month old son like he was one of their family!

Salads are large and can serve a whole table. They were crisp, fresh, and dressed just right.

My father-in-law had a baked ziti and meatball which was beautiful! Bubbly, golden-browned cheese adorned the brim of a warm casserole dish. The meal was hearty, warming, and something I am coming in to order next time I have a bad day!

My wife ordered shrimp and angel hair with asparagus tips and vodka blush. It was a very well balanced pasta dish. The shrimp were ample, fresh, and cooked to perfection. The fear with an \"Italian\" dish like this is that the line cook will lose his or her mind with garlic and salt, smothering the flavor profile. Not so at Eddie's. The dish was balanced very very well. Filling, satisfying, easily a repeat performer. 

But, the pizza... OH THE PIZZA! We make our own pizza at home and the dough from scratch. So I can be a little picky when it comes to the crust on my pizza. Eddie's has a starter dough, aged about 3 days, that is added the the fresh dough that day for the pizza to be made. It's just short of a sourdough method. The dough bakes with a beautiful crisp around the edges and a warm billowy middle. I probably could eat just the crust. However, I opted for the Salumi that included salumi (salami), prosciutto ham, sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella, and asiago cheeses. It was every bit crispy and delicious as it appeared! One of the better pies that I have had. 

We absolutely cannot wait to go back and were immediately on the phone recommending this place to family. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a nice, hidden spot with great Italian food. The decor inside is very fancy and reminds you of a resteraunt you'd find downtown and not in Seven Hills. Our server Lindsey was very kind and always said \"Of course\" with a smile whenever we asked for something. You get started with lots of baskets of yummy cheese bread which was very moist and tasty. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan (pro-tip you can change your pasta choice if you'd like.) It came with two huge chicken patties adorned with mozzarella and tomatoes. The pasta size was a little small but the main star was the chicken. For dessert, I got the fresh cookie with ice cream which was freshly baked (super hot!) Overall, a great spot with average portions and a great waitstaff. (Lindsey you were awesome!)"}
{"text":"A damn tasty Italian restaurant. The portions are all pretty large, and quite well constructed. Good for friends and family to get together and enjoy a good, comparatively cheap dinner."}
{"text":"I only got a carryout pizza, so can't justify giving five stars based on that alone, but guarentee that I will be going back very soon based on my pizza, and the carryout menu I picked up when I was there.  They have a ton more going on than just pizza, and lots of the options looked amazing, but I am on my mission to try all the pizza around Cleveland.  
Got a proscuitto and onion pizza, and it was perfect in almost every way.  The bacon-y meat was crispy, crunchy, and perfect, and the onions were not cooked to death, and had just a bit of snap left to them.  The cheese was a good quality, and there was just the right amount.  After looking back at how I am describing this, I think I figured out the perfect word to describe it \"Goldilocks Pizza\".  Most of the time there is one component off on a pizza, but none of them were here, which brings me to my last \"just right\" part of the pizza.  The crust was good.  Had a crispiness to the outside, and was just doughy enough, not too thick or thin.  The one thing that excapes my mind is the sauce.  I will do further research and get back to you asap."}
{"text":"Holy Foccacia, this food is great.

My husband kept showing off about going here for lunch with his work \"buddies.\" However, he kept my snotty remarks at bay by always bringing me home his leftovers, including the eggplant and wild mushroom sandwich and a few slices of the thin-crust pizza (the \"Salumi\" with some kinds of Italian meats, sun-dried tomatoes, and some other stuff).

Today we decided to take an \"early bird dinner\" / \"late bird lunch\" trip over to the restaurant, because we were already in the area doing stuff. At first I thought I was underdressed - because the interior seems awfully nice for a place with \"Pizzeria\" in the name - but I quickly realized that we were just fine in our scrubby t-shirts and shorts.

Both the hostess and our waitress were extremely friendly, in a really genuine-seeming way.

The foccacia they bring you at the beginning is very good, with some sea salt sprinkled on there. We shared a full-size Caesar salad, and were able to get the dressing on the side, no problem. It was very refreshing and was served with chilled plates - a nice touch. Instead of croutons, there were thinly sliced crostini which were very crunchy and great dipped in the dressing.

I got the eggplant sandwich, which I'd enjoyed at home previously (and which is noted on their menu as a \"favorite\") and my husband got the spicy calamari. My sandwich was friggin' heavenly. It was crunchy, greasy in all the right places, and served with PIPING hot marinara (I'm telling you, this sauce did not stop steaming for ten minutes. I've never seen sauce stay hot that long!). The sandwich had fried eggplant slices, wild mushrooms, tomatoes, provolone cheese, and was served on what else...? Foccacia. Oh joy! Yet it didn't leave me feeling like I just ate a brick.

You can choose a side (like I really needed anything else?) of a cannelini bean salad; fries; or soup. I had the bean salad, which also had just the right amount of pesto as well as roasted red peppers. I was extremely happy with this.

We got some decadent-looking cupcakes for later, including one with a chocolate ganache atop marshmallow buttercream, as well as one with malted milk balls on top.

I might sound like a lunatic, but even the diet coke tasted great here.

Everything was affordable, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A great little neighborhood joint, serving fresh Italian food.  Great pizzas, pastas, and the kids love the meatballs! Prices are right and the servers are always cordial and accommodating.  Yes, you can't swing a pizza box without hitting an Italian restaurant in greater Cleveland, but sadly most just aren't that great- this one is."}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped in for lunch and planned on one of their great pizzas. Then we saw the rigatoni bolognese go past to another table. Change of plans!  Wow was that good!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I may be biased. I love this restaurant, and even though I only come here about 5 times a year, the food is always great and the service is always impeccable. The atmosphere is like a trattoria, it's intimate, but not close or crowded. Kids are always welcome and there is a kids menu as well as options for full and half portions....And the half portions have always been sufficient. Today I tried a new item, pasta espanol. A cream sauce flavored with chorizo and peppers, perfect over rigatoni and entirely enjoyable. The wait for the food was barely noticeable and the service was excellent...neither over solicitous nor slow or absent, our server seemed to appear at exactly the appropriate time. My family of five had a unanimously great dinner and we will be back."}
{"text":"Eddie's was OK. 

The Tuscan Potato and Sausage soup was delicious, The René Boucher Calamari was really good as well. However our main dishes weren't that mind blowing. Danielle had the Chicken Sorrento which was fine but could have used something like cherry peppers or banana peppers to give it something that would make it pop. I had the Lemon Parmesan Chicken which was also fine. perfectly moist - which goes a long way, but bland. as was the pasta w/ the asiago cream sauce. 

The pizzas here look incredible but they are rather costly. $12 for a small cheese pizza? c'mon. i hope it's damn good but i don't think i'm willing to take my chances."}
{"text":"This was an awesome dinner. The place is hidden a bit, next to Aldis which kind of makes it even more of a great surprise. 

Service: for starters we went at 8 pm on a Friday night & only waited 15 minutes to be seated, pretty awesome. We had purchased an amazon local deal which we let the waitress know when we sat down. Sometimes using a groupon-like deal ends up guaranteeing sub par service but not in this case at all. Our server was fantastic.

Food: we opted for juniors spicy calamari as an appetizer (the small portion for $11 is plenty to split) and a 9\" primo pesto pizza ($12). With the complementary pieces of bread this was all more than enough to have us full with leftovers at the end of the night. The food came out super fast, in fact we were done within 45 minutes. (On a packed Friday night)! 4/5 stars just because the pizza wasn't all that we were expecting, it was not amazing but pretty good! Everything was also very fresh. Add a yuengling and (incredible) tiramisu for dessert and the bill came out to about $32 (not subtracting the voucher we had)."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a staple in our restaurant rotation! Great Italian food and salads. They have great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot for being in a plaza.  Good italian food. The house salad and baked ravioli is my fav."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Lots of meatballs. Pizza was OK. I was really hungry though. It could have tasted like a cat tail for all I know."}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened this place... So so very happy... In this particular area, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, and Little Caesars have dominated for I don't know how many years. If you wanted to have a real, honest to God, pizza, you would have do drive out to Lakewood or Cleveland for it. And even then it's a little disappointing. But Pizza Cerino has breathed new life into the pizza industry of Seven Hills. Now this is pizza. Good Pizza! Good salads too... Color me impressed. Will definitely return, and with friends!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere.  I've had most things on the menu and really never went wrong."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service was excellent. The food was very good. It's a gem among the chain restaurant dregs of this area. The pizza was great. The braised beef ravioli was delicious. I highly recommend it. Thanks Eddie. (We didn't actually meet Eddie.)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonably priced. It is a small restaurant, so it's best that you call ahead for larger groups and there is usually a wait on the weekends.

Arrived on a Saturday and like I stated from above there was about a 45 minute wait. But the smell of fresh garlic kept me waiting patiently.
Our waitress was awesome, drinks kept flowing, the good times kept rolling.

Our table started out with some delicious Zucchini Planks which came with this amazing aioli! Ahhhh! I practically ate the whole dish but hey im Italian this is my specialty food!

Baked Gnocchi Florentine was the main course and let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised because Gnocchi is either hit or miss and they HIT IT ON THE HEAD here! The gnocchi were cooked perfectly, tossed in a cream sauce and breadcrumbs. OMG my mouth is watering all over again writing this review.

The atmosphere is casual, and very family oriented. My kids really enjoyed their menu too so it has a little bit of something for everybody!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza from here for takeout and eaten in. Both are good options. 
I ordered pizzas for takeout when we were having a bunch of people to the house. It's a step up from ordering the usual pepperoni pizzas and everyone loved the variety and gourmet toppings.
The bread is good but we asked if they could warm it up and then bring it back which they did. A recommendation - keep the bread warm. I think it's better that way. The staff was so friendly. We got the Dante's Inferno and I seriously regretted it. It is so hot. It's aptly named, wasn't like I shouldn't have known. I think I've started to ignore spicy warnings because I usually have no problem. But that is one spicy pizza. Luckily the waitress saw my tears and brought me some milk that was greatly appreciated. My husband had no problem with the pizza though. Nice place! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Every.time.  house salad is amazing. Best pizza in town. Service always good entries are  large and prices good"}
{"text":"Best place to eat! I'm for sure turning into a regular! Shrimp and Gnocchi Bake if you like a little spice is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, good service.  Carry out container is paper and not styrofoam...definite plus."}
{"text":"Best pizza by far in this area of town. I love, love, love their mushroom pizza. The flavor of the mushrooms are so earthy and combine so well with the drops of ricotta cheese and white pizza sauce. All other pizzas we have tried are exceptional as well but the mushroom is Fantastic! Oh and don't go without a cannoli! Yum!"}
{"text":"It was a 45 min wait. Pizza was too salty. No veggie pizza, had to order reg pie & had to pay $2 xtra for each toppings.  Our 1 pie cost us $24"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Zucchini Planks are the best and for an entrée the lemon chicken is fantastic."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Cerino offers delicious and different Italian fare that is always reliable and affordable. My parents live in Old Brooklyn, my boyfriend's parents live in Broadview Heights... Pizzeria Cerino is the perfect spot to meet in the middle.

Cerino's eclectic menu touts unique Italian dishes alongside traditional classics. Our favorites: the yummy foccacia bread, fried zucchini planks with lemon aioli, and lemon parm chicken. The atmosphere is open yet warm and the customer service is always a treat. 

Entrees run $11-$18. Come hungry because they serve up huge portions!"}
{"text":"This place was so yummy! I ordered the baked ravioli which was delicious. The service was excellent! Taylor was so nice, gave recommendations and never left our drinks below half. Then the manager came over and thanked us for choosing to eat there for our one night in Cleveland. I definitely recommend eating here! We will be back if we are ever in town again!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken piccatta! I went here while traveling for work and I was extremely happy."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! We tried multiple pizzas and all were fantastic! I personally LOVED the Pesto Primo. Do not forget to order the meatball sliders as an appetizer because they are phenomenal and you won't regret it. We will be back!! Too many things I wanted to try!"}
{"text":"No special kids menu, but they will make a kids portion of any pasta with any sauce for a reasonable price.
My pizza was loaded with toppings and tasty, but the crust was not exceptional. Not bad, but nothing special.
I look forward to a return trip."}
{"text":"Their fall special is butternut squash ravioli, make sure you give it a try.  It is fantastic.   I usually only get pizza here, but I am glad I tried something new.  

For a great appetizer, get the zucchini planks.  Thin and crispy, the way they should be!

Great service as always.  If you have a taste for pizzeria style food,  this is your place."}
{"text":"Meh. Pizza doesn't taste hand tossed. didn't know if they use a brick oven/coal fired, cuz the bottom crust has a trussed grill pattern, as if they sat on trays in something?

Real gripe is price is not worth the food, pay for the \"more upscale\" atmosphere, which I didn't stay long in having called in a carryout."}
{"text":"There are only a handful of places where you can always count on a good meal, and this is one of them.

In the suburbs surrounding Parma, this is one of the few restaurants where the staff is well trained, and professional, the food( from the bread, to the salad, to the pizza toppings, pasta and seafoood) is  always fresh and cooked to perfection,

They have a specialty pizza to suit just about anyone, and if you don't want to spend quite so much you can make your own from a wide range of ingredients.

My son likes a spicy pasta with shrimp dish that is no longer on the menu, but they are always kind enough to make it for him when he asks.  The chef even stopped by tonight to make sure he liked it.

If you want to go, get there early.  It's a popular place, and rightly so."}
{"text":"I liked what I ordered at Fast Eddie's so I decided to check out their sister restaurant, Eddie's Pizza Cerino. This place is close to my work so it's was pretty convenient to stop here to pick up dinner on my way home. It's located in a newer looking plaza between Aldi's and Ruby Tuesday's. Plenty of parking. The inside is clean and has this upscale but still warm, Italian vibe. As for staff, one gentleman didn't seem to be very knowledgeable but on another occasion the woman who helped me was fantastic! Very friendly and experienced. 


-Italian Blue Smoke Pizza $12: 6 small slices that I thought were just okay. Other reviewers seem to find it pretty tasty.
-Lemon Parmesan Chicken $14 - I did enjoy this, a nice light lemon and cream flavor, would have liked more sauce. However, I was disappointed it didn't include a small side salad (this seems to be something only old school mom and pop places do anymore). The lunch portion you only get one chicken breast but that is plenty and it includes a salad or soup for $11, a much better meal and deal in my opinion.  
-Sausage Stuffed Peppers $8: This was very good! You get two but they are nice sized. Would have preferred a little more sauce, but I like that it came 2 slices of the house bread. 
-Junior's Spicy Calamari $11: Legit baby squid, none of that fake rubbery sliced stuff, and it comes with lemon to squeeze over it. I noticed a ton of peppers and onions though, at least an equal portion to the squid which should have been the star of the show. 
-Cookies 3 for $2.75: Lemon drop and what I think were nut horn cookies? A nice little after dinner treat. Supposedly made by a local baker, but they didn't know who.


Overall I would go here again and I would recommend giving it at least one try. I know in the future I would ask for more sauce, but that is because I am a saucy kind of lady. I'd also probably go for the pasta and appetizers over the pizza, but that's just my personal preference."}
{"text":"This is a \"GO-TO\" place. You can ALWAYS rely on delicious food with lots of flavor and primo service.  I like to sit at the bar, the bartender is great- she remembered what I drank and it has been a couple months since my last visit! Stellar."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago for my aunt's birthday. Good food, a little pricy. My aunt loves Carrie Cerino's so we took her here to keep it in the family, without the older crowd. The place was packed and they were very accommodating for my reservation. The table was ready to go when we got there, but good thing we booked a reservation... We would not have gotten in any other way. 

Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"I think this place was decent.  
Lets start with the bread that came with the meal. It was soft and quite pocketed.  It was served with butter, however the table had a bottle of olive oil.  It was good but not warm, i think if this type of bread is to be served it should be toasty or warm. But hey it was still good and free!

Appetizer- Ordered the calamari. This one was with banana peppers and service with Mexican Cholula garlic sauce and some type of cilantro sour cream.  The  Squid was prepared vary well, Crispy and soft with the right amount of breading.  We ordered the smaller order and it was  a good portion for 2 people.

Next here is where a couple of stars are lost. We split a medium specialty pizza. Its the one with prosciutto, forget what is called, It was a decent pie but not worth $17 dollars, no way, the size nor the amount of toppings  justify the price they are asking.  When we got the bill we were like how much was that?

The service was very prompt, efficient, and friendly

I would go back but not for the pie!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this Italian restaurant in a sea of sandwich shops!  I come here almost weekly and sit at the bar.  The ladies at the bar are always friendly and attentive.  I've almost tried everything on the menu and have not disliked anything yet.  A mandatory must when I dine is the cousin Ron's calamari (without olives for me).  The sun dried tomatoes and fresh grated cheese blend so perfectly with the light breading.  I consider myself a calamari connoisseur and this is my all time favorite.  Check out their happy hour menu $5 mussels, regular calamari, and awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Love Eddie's!!! My fiance and I go just about every chance we get ! Delicious homemade Italian food, at a reasonable price. Always good service! And the bread.... oh my god .... the bread is to DIE for!  We always fill up on it before our food comes, but that doesn't stop us from pigging out!  My favorite meal is the chicken gnocchi florentine... they took it off the menu for a bit, worst couple months of my life. Thank goodness it's back On!"}
{"text":"Maria - you rock girl! 

Randomly and I mean randomly stopped in and asked for a slice of pizza. Maria said no, but persuaded my mom and I to have a seat and that it wouldn't take long. 

I asked for a \"white pizza\" not even sure I knew what I wanted. Maria said they'd do a margarita with a white sauce. HOLY CRAP it was AWESOME. The pizza was gone before we pulled out of the driveway. 

Maria working the take out was super cool and someone I'd hang out with. Thanks girl for making my day!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me preface this review by stating that we LOVE Eddie C's food.  We frequented Eddie's Creekside when he owned that location in Brecksville, and have since followed him to the Pizzaria since it opened several years ago.  The food is always great- and priced very reasonably.  My husband and I usually end up ordering one of the delicious pizzas and splitting their tasty house salad (it's my favorite!).  For the food alone, I would not hesitate by giving them the full five stars, but the service at the bar the past several times we've gone only warrants three stars.  It's not that the gals behind the bar are impolite, it's that they really need to take a course in basic bar-tending.  The Cosmopolitan I ordered the past few times there was horrid- even after I asked the woman to re-mix it. There was a gentleman sitting next to us last eveing that took one sip of his Long Island Iced Tea and had them take it away and give him a basic mixed drink in it's place.  We've always enjoyed their drink menu in the past, but lately it's just not delivering.  Also, what is it with the current trend of servers not writing orders down??  Really, you aren't impressing me by trying to commit our entire order to memory.  Impress me by bringing the correct order.  The blue-haired young woman who was our server at the bar ended up having my husband's order messed up. (I think she was also the server who made the really bad drinks).  PLEASE write down orders!!!!  I will not think less of you- I promise.  Eddie did end up taking one of our drinks off of our check at the end, which was a kind gesture.  Of course we will return, just hoping for some better bar servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Everything on the menu was sounding delicious so it took me a long time to decide. Finally went with a prosciutto and sun dried tomato pizza. Something I use to get from the gourmet pizza places I frequented in Cincinnati. Immediately got a bad vibe when I watched a kid in his early 20's start making my pizza back in the kitchen which I was seated with a full view of. This guy looked like they just hired him of a prison work release or something.

Anyway... Pizza took way too long to cook for it's size easily 30+ minutes. I know because I've ordered these things a hundred times. When it was finally served to me I saw why... 

The \"cook\" had taken the extra time to burn my very meager looking 4 slivers of sundried tomato and 4 pieces of prosciutto all the way through. Didn't have another 30 mins to wait for food so I decided to pick off the burnt toppings and choke down the rest which taste kinda like a Zesta cracker with Prego tomato sauce on it. Paid my $20 check and away I went. Don't think I'll risk bringing another person here for dinner even though it looked interesting."}
{"text":"Finally. An Italian restaurant that got it right! 

In any random neighborhoods around town, you'll find multiple Americanized eye-'talian joints doing Italian all the same. Boring red sauced dishes, meatball subs and mediocre pizza. Each of these mom & pop parmigiana shops seem interchangeable. Very few leave any sort of lasting impact. Very few are daring enough to put their own take on a food that we've come to take for granted.  America as a whole seems to be over-saturated with this type of cuisine. So, of course, it goes without saying that a new take on traditional Italian favorites would be a welcome thing, right? Introducing Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino....

First off, the concept: As an option, you have the ability to order a half or full order of  just about every appetizer, soup, salad or pasta. This both maximizes value and allows you to sample a bigger portion of the menu. 

Next, I must mention the house-baked bread. It's a salty, peppery, oily focaccia that would put the finest artisanal bakeries to shame. Save some to mop up leftover mussel broth.

To eat, we shared a half order of the Eggplant & Roasted Garlic Ravioli w/ red pepper pasta filled with eggplant, served in a sweet vermouth sauce with wild mushrooms, spinach and parmesan. Woah. Good shit! Tender pasta, well balanced in flavor and the sauce. Oh, the sauce! A perfect accompaniment to the dish.

Next, we each ordered our own pie. A tough decision considering there are close to a dozen specialty varieties to chose from. In the end, I ordered the \"Salumi\" w/ red sauce, thin sliced salumi, prosciutto ham, sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella and asiago cheese. My accomplice, the \"Mediterranean\" w/ white sauce, mozzarella, goat cheese, artichokes, black olives, spinach, roasted red peppers. Wowzers! Thin, tasty, wood oven charred crust, high end toppings and a very attractive looking pizza to say the least.  

In a seemingly everlasting journey to find the best pizza around, we were both in agreement that this was among the best pizza in town. Next to Crostatas in Highland Heights, this pie ranks right up there. 

Eddie, you've done well. Can't wait to come back and sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza pies I have had throughout the whole country. Great service, outstanding desserts, The gold standard, that I will now hold other pizza pies to."}
{"text":"We're visiting Ohio from out of state (we're from New Jersey) and tripped on Eddie's by accident.  My husband wanted Italian, and this place seemed to fit the bill as being casual enough to take the kids, and yet not a pizza place.  It was the best meal decision we made the whole trip.
Our waitress Dawn was excellent, she was very friendly, came by frequently and kept our glasses and bread full.  We had calamari, which was cooked perfectly, as an appetizer, I had the baked ravioli, my husband had rigatoni, my son had spaghetti with meatballs and my daughter had the soup and a side salad.  All of the food was excellent, and the portion sizes were very generous.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a while decent pricesGreat atmosphere Server was very attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Top notch Italian food. I'd rather eat here than anywhere in Little Italy. Get the spaghetti and meatballs and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered a soup and salad.  Half way through by salad I find a dead large flying insect in my salad.  I was done after that.  I had a very nice server but the manager came my for less than five seconds and said it was an unfortunate mistake, grabbed the insect salad and left.  Very rude in my opinion. They did not charge me or my daughters meal which was nice."}
{"text":"Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino is great!  This is where I take friends when I need someplace near my apartment that is impressive.  The pizza is delicious, the salads are impressive, the interior is cozy, the staff is friendly, did I mention the pizza is delicious?  They always have a few specials going on depending on the time of the year, desserts for the season and lots of seafood options during Lent.  I have been here about 5 times or so and have always left a very, very happy customer.  Psst - their Facebook page is a good one to \"like\", they always post beautiful images of the food, specials, as well as opportunities to win gift cards!"}
{"text":"A Great family run Resturant! I had the Chicken Piccata and it was perfect! Service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"Delicious salads!  So refreshing and seasonal.  The bread is excellent and they bring you as much as you want also.  The pizzas are really good and the wait staff is very friendly.  I will most definitely come back here soon.  They also have a full bar and wine list ."}
{"text":"Comfortable, pleasant surroundings.  Nice menu selections of pasta dishes and pizzas.  Good beer and wine selection.  Tried the pizza Rustica on the first visit.  Tasty, fresh ingredients.  Not too large, not too greasy.  Recommended"}
{"text":"My sister held her graduation party here, on a Saturday afternoon, and things could not have been more perfect.  The salads were fresh, and made with absolute quality ingredients, and portions were quite generous! I ordered the Whole Wheat Penne Sorrento, and was very impressed with the vegetables, pasta, and freshness of the dish. The staff was fantastic, and everyone was very happy."}
{"text":"There are so many good things to say about Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino that it feels wrong to say it wasn't *great.* The food is very good, the service was attentive and helpful, the beer and wine selection was well-chosen and the wait, even on a Friday night, was not unreasonable. 

But.

The lighting is just bright enough that the restaurant doesn't feel intimate - keep that in mind if you have date night (or deep conversation) on the agenda. And the food, while delicious (we had the Blue Smoke BBQ and Primo Pesto pizzas, and the Tuscan salad - all of which I would order again) was...exactly what I expected.  Really, really good  - but not one bite surprised me, and that for me makes the difference between good and great. I would certainly go back, but it was my trip to grandma Carrie Cerino's restaurant last year (complete with Sinatra soundtrack and gnocchi that were swoon-worthy) that made me say \"You have to try this!\""}
{"text":"A little fancier than your run of the mill pizzeria. More of a restaurant, if you will. This place was absolutely packed! Luckily the family had already gotten a table by the time we arrived or we would have waited for over an hour.

They started out by bringing some bread to the table. It was delicious. Very soft with a hint of garlic. I grabbed two pieces against my will and had to force myself not to have any more. I followed that up with the Dante's Inferno pizza, which lived up to its name with a fire that burned in my stomach for the rest of the night. It had spicy sauce, ass kicking peppers, hot sausage, and goat cheese. Normally when a waitress says something is spicy, I laugh with skepticism. My eyes were watering by the second bite. So good! Not knowing what was ahead of me, I ordered a side of ranch. This ranch was a revelation. It was no ordinary ranch...oh no. I couldn't even begin to describe it. It tasted almost like a pizza ranch with tomato and spices mixed in. It danced on my tongue like the god of dressing made it himself and sent it to Eddies just for me. What I wouldn't give for a big bottle of it to take home. Sigh.

My boyfriend had the BBQ blue chicken pizza. Not quite as good as the spicy lovers dream but almost. It also had goat cheese on it which I find awesome.

The waitress was very nice and let us eat our own birthday cupcakes we brought with us. Not many places allow outside food but she even supplied the lighter for candles. Very cool. They also offer gluten free pasta for the entree dishes. Overall a great experience and I would gladly return."}
{"text":"Eddie's is a very good Italian restaurant that is priced right.  The Italian dishes are a great value.  Because the bread is so good you will easily fill up on an entree which can be ordered half sized.  The pizza is also great. I have tried the arriabatta and the blue smoke pizza and both were tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's our 'fancy night dinner' since we don't get out too much. The wait time has not been too terrible for us yet, though it is only ever 2 of us. 

I love all the art for sale on the walls, and got to sit under my favorite, a ship. It was rather crowded, however I didn't mind since it made me feel like we where in Europe haha. 

Food comes fast and hot. We've also just ordered pizza to go, it's so delicious. I love their bread as well. I'll have to update my review when we go again since it has been a minute."}
{"text":"I love this place! And I'm so lucky my work is just around the corner.

Starts with the light and fluffy focaccia served before the meal. Dipped in olive oil - so tasty!

The lunch specials are perfect serving size. Chef always has delicious specials that I wish were on the menu. Today was a decadent plate of butternut squash ravioli perfect for the season. With a side salad and the bread already mentioned $11 is a great value.

And for the evening, calamari appetizer is excellent. Appreciate the good beer selection, even if a short list."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this was. Perhaps it shouldn't have been in light of all the glowing reviews here, but it still was. Eddie's Creekside was and is not a fave of ours, but this sure as heck isn't THAT Eddie's. 

First of all, they did a great job on the restaurant itself. Not huge but not tiny either.  It just feels right; warm and inviting. We sat in a very comfortable booth in the bar area (so just how happy are YOU, non-smoking Yelpers, that we don't have to breathe in that crap anymore? And, smokers, don't even try to justify the habit. Smoking is by now an IQ test: you smoke, you fail).  We were waited on by \"Cheryl,\" (forgive me if that's spelled wrong) who was just terrific. Very nice, professional, extremely knowledgeable about the menu, just all in all a perfect server who made a great dinner all the better. 

We tried the Parmasan Zucchini Planks and Sauteed Clams. Both were perfectly prepared (and I am not a usually a zucchini fan) and will absolutely be on our future \"must try again\" list. 

We got the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese for dinner.  I liked it more than my wife but not because of any flavor issues. They PILE on the meat sauce which for me is great, but for my wife not so much. Easily remedied by getting the sauce on the side if your tastes match my wife's. Plus, this is VERY much a meat sauce in that it's browner than it is red. When I lived in NY this was called \"gravy\" and for good reason.  We did get to try their marinara sauce which accompanied the zucchini and it was very tasty.  

We really found nothing that did not exceed our expectations. And, yes,  expectations WERE modest, but they were just blown away by how great everything was.  We plan on visiting again very, very soon. 

Congrats to Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino on doing it right."}
{"text":"Back again. You can not go wrong here. If you like Italian fare, you live in the suburbs, this is the place. Three types if calamari, but I like Rene because it is lightly breaded, and two dipping sauces. The choices come half and full. Get full so you have seconds the next day. And, ask your very congenial waitress to warm the bread. So much better. Everyone who works here is kind. Dessert is yum. The house Montalepuciano is nice. Ambiance is always perfect. Mangia!"}
{"text":"First time in here.  Girlfriend found on yelp and wanted to go for her birthday dinner.  Nice drink selection with dinner. Ordered drinks, calamari, shrimp pasta dish, and gnocchi dish. Food is good. Spoke to server about girlfriend birthday for a dessert. Server totally forgot about it. Bummer. Oh well. Food was good though."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. And thanks to Help for finding it. I agree with other reviewers that the calamari was awesome.  And the medium rustica pizza was too much for us to eat."}
{"text":"Tried the baked ravioli. For $11 you get four 2x2 raviolis (thin and flavorless). Not really much of a value. Think i'll head to taco bell after this...at least there you can FILL UP for $11."}
{"text":"Great food. ..great service...everything I've ever had there was delicious!   Zucchini planks are a yummy appetizer and the house salad is Delish."}
{"text":"I visited with a large group last night (1/7/2013). Our server, Melissa, was very pleasant, helpful, and efficient considering the size of our party. I ordered a full plate of the Gnocchi special ($12.95) and had plenty leftover to box up and save for today's lunch. I also had a glass of excellent Chianti ($7.00), and a piece of Chocolate Cassata cake for $1.00 (a special that runs, I believe, through January). Oh, the bread was HEAVENLY! Great atmosphere. Definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"After a string of horrid meals on the road, we were treated to this delightful place! I miss the days of the old school pizzeria that my family used to take us to when we were little. This place has that kind of vibe, but modern and unpretentious- gray, brick and cool light fixtures. We were taken there by our client who goes there often and said that a lot of the photos on the wall were taken by the owner's wife. Being in marketing, I noticed little touches like all the menus being placed face side down and all the chairs being angled in one direction like they're waiting for you- who pays attention to that kind of detail??

The service was friendly and snappy, she was down to earth and made great suggestions. We were with a big group so we ordered a lot of things- we got the blue smoke pizza (if you're into bbq sauce on your pizza you will die when you eat this!), followed by the fried zucchini (the mustard sauce served with this dish is realllyyyyy good) and then I got the gnocchi which had chicken, a cheese sauce and a nice bread crumb topping. We walked out fat and happy. I wish they'd open a location in AZ! Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were planning a fancy anniversary dinner, then decided pizza sounded better and headed here. Suprisingly it was the perfect mix of fancy setting and kick ass pizza.

We both ordered a drink and went to town on a basket of bread that would convert any gluten free dieter to the carb side. So fresh and soft with a garlicky glaze...life changing. Perfect for washing down a glass of Moscato the size of my face. The drinks were super generous sizes and the wine was amazing for only $8 a (giant) glass.

We were going to oder 2 small pizzas but the waitress suggested a medium and small, which worked perfectly. The small is like a personal size pizza cut in 6, the medium was 8 regualr sized slices. The dough on both was so fresh and the sauce definitly had a homemade taste to it. We had a small white pizza with spinach (delicious) and a medium pepperoni (even better).

Our waitress was seriously a saint. She knew the menu, checked on us all the time, and was super personable. 

I would definitly recommend going here for literally any occasion. We got a table without a problem and our food just as fast."}
{"text":"The eggplant is to die for.  The flavor of the marinara sauce explodes in your mouth and the overall dining experience is worthy of 6 stars.  Service is impeccable and speedy. .. none of this \"How are you guys?\"  (my wife is NOT a guy)  She had the chicken rosemary and it rates a 6 too."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, welcoming atmosphere. The pizzette, which is a giant chocolate chip cookie served hot and gooey is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! If i had unlimited income, I would eat here more often. I live very close so I mostly get carryout. I think I have only eaten in here once. When it first opened it used to be tight on space, it has opened up since they expanded. It is loud, but I don't expect it to be quiet. Food is top notch, I have eaten at Carrie Cerino's since I was a child and have always like Eddie's other restaurants he has opened. They have excellent salads and my favorite dish is the Lemon Chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"I had time to kill before an appointment and happened to be driving down Broadview. To be honest, I had never even heard of Pizzeria Cerino. The storefront was friendly and inviting, so I went in expecting to find a little pizza shop.
I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to find a spacious, beautifully decorated, \"ristorante\". I was greeted immediately by very pleasant staff and shown to a table.

I was dining solo and was not expecting to get the 'red carpet treatment' as many servers look at a solo diner as a waste of time.  I feel bad I don't remember her name, but my server was spectacular. She was very attentive and made sure to check on me multiple times. The service was efficient.  She suggested the specials and really did a wonderful job.

Not to mention the food!  This may have been the best pizza I have ever had. I tried the Mediterranean, with spinach, artichokes, black olives, goat cheese and red pepper. It was seasoned and baked perfectly. The flavors all came together for a masterpiece. I also had the generous half portion of the house salad which was delicious along side the garlic bread they serve."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Three friends and I wanted some decent dinner last night. Yelp led us here as it was close in proximity to my friend's apartment. We shared the fried zucchini appetizer, which was tasty. The bread was great also. The pasta entrees are all around $10 or $11. The chicken parmesan was very filling and the portion was huge. Enough to get full and have leftovers. My friend ordered the lemon chicken pasta and loved it. Another friend got a shrimp pasta dish and said it was good. The service was excellent. This was a nice, cheap dinner."}
{"text":"The pizza is really nothing special.  Everything else is really good though.  I had some appetizer that had tomatoes, cheese, and herbs; this was way better than my pizza.  Just remember not to bother with the pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in and sat at the bar. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio. A server came along with (which looked like very good) bread with a smalling dipping bowl of olive oil. Picked up the bread and dipped it in the oil. It wasn't warm like I expected. It wasn't even room temperature. What is was was ice cold like they just took it out of the refrigerator. There was a couple sitting next to me. I said, is your bread ice cold. She responded, \"They always serve it that way\". Now I know this place gets high marks but when they fail to deliver something so basic as warm bread we didn't want to follow through with the rest of the meal. We left."}
{"text":"I have only gotten carryout here, so I don't know what the dining in experience is like. BUT for carryout, Cerino's has been great every time. If you're looking for pizza that's more than your standard then this is a great place to go. 

Get the meatball sliders, served on foccacia, a very delicious starter. I've tried the Primo Pesto, Toscana, Pancetta & Pomodoro, and Dante's Inferno--all were excellent. The crust has that wood fired quality that's more chewy cracker-like than breadstick and the toppings are top notch. Dante's Inferno is definitely spicy, not pretend spicy to please wimpy palettes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Cleveland area.  The fried ravioli is to die for and the service has always been great with a family feel to it.  They have a great big table you can reserve for larger parties. An all around great meal."}
{"text":"We've been here only once. We tried to get in a couple other times but the place was jammed with long wait times. 

The food we had was good and the service great. Too bad they can't expand and accommodate more guests at the same time."}
{"text":"I used to work for Eddie Cerino back in the day when I was shaving peach fuzz off my chin and driving an 1982 Cutlass Supreme.  He used to kick us out of the kitchen when he was making his secret family recipe bread.  After I tasted it I knew why, because it was the best around and he didn't want anyone else duplicating it.  
At Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino I had the Cioppino and it was excellent. Like a bouillabaisse with pasta. Sorry for using a foodie snob term.  If you don't know what bouillabaisse is, (its seafood stew of awesomeness).  With just the right spiciness and tomato flavor I will remember this special for a long time. Eddie is running this dish until December so go get yourself some before its gone.  
This is another successful new restaurant started by Eddie in the Seven Hills 'hood.  It was packed but we got a table in ten minutes.  The wait staff was just as good as any higher end restaurant.  
I brought my 10 month old twins and 3 year old son with my wife.  It was as family friendly as the Bill Cosby show or Leave it to Beaver.  But this ain't no out of fashion restaurant.  Its new, hip and is attractive to every generation and marital situation.  It was great to get the whole family out together to have a great meal.  Maybe that is why the Cerino family has been so successful in Cleveland.  They understand what keeps family together:  good food, good home, and good traditions."}
