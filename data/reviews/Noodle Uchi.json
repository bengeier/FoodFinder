{"text":"I always give new businesses a starting chance but this place is just so awkward. From the ordering to the seating placement to the service. Very small and cramped and that's when it's empty!! The food is just not  at the level it should be when charging these prices. I can really tell everything from the broth to the noodles to the meats are all prepackaged and are not made to order. My suggestion skip this place there is way more variety on Craig street and with waaaay better food, try Union grill or Yuva!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tiny portions and poor quality. Gave it a few chances but they never failed to disappoint."}
{"text":"Gross instant ramen cooked in salt broth. No flavor at all. The only commendable part of it was the egg which was really delicious."}
{"text":"Craig street quality food for NYC prices. The shrimp tempura became a soggy mess in the soup. Also $8 for two steamed pork buns? And the set up is whack. You can't sit down without bumping into everyone in line who is reading the very confusing menu only available on the screen."}
{"text":"I ordered Udon noodle with miso soup base, add been sprouts, edamame, boiled egg, seaweed and corns. The egg is definitely delicious! The spicy soup is mild but great. I finished the whole bowl and even the miso soup. I want to try shrimp next time."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place until I asked Google where I could get a pork cutlet bowl here in Pittsburgh. And as if answering my prayer for a new ramen spot, this place popped up. I have to say, this tiny hole in the wall is absolutely delicious. I got the shoyu ramen with green onion, bamboo, seasoned egg, and bean sprouts with pork katsu. The soup is absolutely savory and the egg is perfection. The only gripe I have is that the pork is a little too fatty and chewy. But other than that, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the door, I knew this place wasn't well thought out.   The building is narrow, and the start of the line is as far away from the door.  The flow as you place your order is that you work your way towards the door, and finally pay at the door.   If there are ever more than two people there, you'll be fighting your way against the crowd upstream.  The people waiting in line were crowded around our table, but it's not their fault.  The place is small!   I didn't feel like building my own bowl, so I went with the ton katsu bowl from the menu.  The bowl is rice, two breaded pork cutlets, a splash of ton katsu sauce, and a few of pieces of salad greens.  The pork cutlets were not sliced! So here I am with my chopsticks, wondering how to deal with the pork. I went to get a knife, but they didn't have any.  The rice (I got the brown) was well prepared, but the bowl as a whole was quite bland.  The pork seemed to be cooked yesterday, there was barely any sauce, and was about impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I can't imagine ever returning here."}
{"text":"Saw that this place opened up next to Sushi Fuku on S Craig and decided to give it a try so I did. Ended up getting a Tonkotsu Ramen Bowel with some extra pork and mini buns to boot. I have to say, I wasn't really too impressed with this place. Not that I was expecting much, but I will say that the broth really wasn't up to par in comparison to places I've tried in the past which serve ramen that tastes way better. Noodles were also pretty bland. They just seemed to lack consistency that you'll find in good noodles, so I guess they were taken out of frozen state instead of being freshly made? Also, the pricing here is not justified ... charging standard fare for substandard food. I don't think I'll make a return"}
{"text":"Noodle Uchi is a new quick serve noodle store with the same idea as the Chipotle-inspired Sushi Fuku. They have a build your own ramen concept, where you can pick your broth, noodle, protein, and toppings, or you can go with a rice bowl if you came here and actually did not want noodles. It's located very conveniently for CMU students, just a few steps from the intersection of Craig and Forbes. There is a decent amount of seating inside, unlike at their neighbor, the craig st sushi fuku. They have a gluten free noodle option with their brown rice ramen, a vegetarian broth in the miso soup, as well as a few vegetarian protein options. They also have lots of sides, like kimchi salad and takoyaki.  For my first visit, I opted for a classic ramen in tonkotsu broth. It was extremely hard to pick a meat, they had shrimp tempura, salmon, pork katsu, and crispy chicken which are all favorites of mine! I ended up going with the chicken chashu because it looked super tasty. I also asked for teriyaki sauce on the meat. They have a wide selection of free regular toppings - spinach, seaweed, green onions, edamame, bean sprouts, and more! They also have paid toppings, like crunchy green onions and the ramen classic - a medium boiled egg. I went with just edamame this time. The bowl takes longer to prepare than at sushi fuku, since you have to wait for the noodles to cook, but it's still pretty fast. It came out really nice and hot, and I was definitely excited to get home and dive right in. I think they have an option where if you say it's to go, they will give you the broth on the side so your noodles don't get soggy. As for the food itself, the ramen noodles were pretty standard and the teriyaki sauce blended with the tonkatsu broth giving it a bit of a sweet taste which I enjoyed. The edamame was a bit crunchier than I like my edamame. The chicken chashu was a great choice though, it was well cooked and super tasty. I ended up drinking all of the broth, I'm curious of what the regular tonkotsu broth tastes like but that mixed with some teriyaki was a real winner. Unfortunately I forgot to take a photo of my meal because I was so excited to eat it, but I'll definitely be back to try out the other options since there's so much on the menu that I like.  EDIT: I don't think this deserves a whole update but I've gone two more times and the different things I have had are pork chashu, shoyu broth, crispy chicken, and udon. The pork chashu was amazing, the day I got chicken chashu I skipped it because it didn't look that good but when I did decide to get it it blew the chicken out of the water. You don't get much, only two slices. I got the crispy chicken on the side so it didn't get soggy, and it was juicy and crunchy, and I got a lot. I was hesitant about getting udon because I feel like you get \"less noodles\" but as I was eating I realized there were a LOT of noodles. The tonkotsu broth was very tasty even without the teriyaki sauce, but the shoyu was extremely salty. I still drank it all, but I would prefer tonkotsu most of the time. The spinach and seaweed were pretty standard, and the edamame was softer and more to my taste if I let it sit in the hot broth for longer.  A note about the steamed buns - 'taco' buns like that pretty common for buns in restaurants, although I cannot vouch for their authenticity. Not sure how they would be able to have build your own steam buns otherwise without it being slow."}
{"text":"This place is just bad. The layout is incredibly awkward, as you enter the store and then fight upstream against people in line and awkwardly spaced tables. Food was lukewarm and prepared incorrectly, as my \"set\" ramen didn't have the listed ingredients."}
{"text":"Pretty on for an Asian spot, but honestly not too much better than iNoodle on CMU campus."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it's a fairly straightforward setup. Like Sushi Fuku, who   I presume they're owned by, it's a Subway-style line of make-your-own noodle soup, salad, or rice bowl.   Very clear menu and gluten free/vegan friendly (items indicated clearly). There's a couple gluten free options, and a few more to choose from if you're vegan.   I've tried the soup noodle (pho) bowls twice, once made with miso soup, this time with shoyu (soy sauce) broth. Both times I tried the baked tofu, with some greens and bean sprouts.   Pros: clean place, friendly staff. Not much confusion in ordering, most of them are very helpful! I got a sample when I asked what the shoyu broth was like.   Cons: the broth. I can't speak on what their pork bone or miso pork broths are like, but I have not been impressed with the miso and shoyu broths. The shoyu broth I'm having now is slightly weirder to me-it leaves an odd taste in my mouth, and is kind of a nauseating mix of flavors. I want to see what other people think of it, since this is quite a subjective manner to categorize it!  The tofu is also slightly....interesting, but not underdone or poorly made. I've never had baked tofu before.   Overall, worthwhile place to try out!"}
{"text":"Was eager to try the new place that had opened on Craig Street! Noodle Uchi is apart of the Sushi Fuku, and Fuku tea family, so it is a create your own noodle bowl concept.   I had udon noodles with tonkotsu broth, pork chashu, egg, bamboo sprouts, edamame, cilantro, green onion, kimchi, tonkatsu sauce, and spicy uchi sauce. Disappointed that they only gave two pieces of pork for $8. It came out to $9.63, because the egg was a dollar extra. Also, the noodles are frozen and they just boil it when you order.   My noodle bowl had nice flavor mainly due to the kimchi and sauces. Also, I was surprised that there was a good amount of noodles and toppings. I was full by the time we were done. My friends who got the shrimp tempura said theirs was good and just asked for it on the side so it wouldn't get soggy. My friend who got the baked tofu, got three huge chunks of tofu that were alright not very flavorful.   Overall, not bad if you are craving a noodle bowl place in Oakland. Disappointed that most of it seems frozen."}
