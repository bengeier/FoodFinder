{"text":"I came to this spa in TWO different occasions. 
The FIRST TIME, they had no technicians available. 
The SECOND TIME, all technicians were available. So I decided to give them a try.
I was greeted by a DEMI. I believe she is the owner. I mentioned her my needs. Which was a shellac pedicure along with the remove of my nail extensions and shellac. 
I needed to leave early, as my toddler needed to take a nap. So I mentioned to her that I'll pay for all services.. once completled and will return.
I was shocked that she wanted to charge me 15$ for removal of my fake nails when she didn't remove it. I mentioned this to her and she replied that it would have taken her 25 mins.
My pedicure was a complete disaster. I still have shellac on my toes.
This place based on what DEMI mentioned is under new manangement. I strongly suggest them working in their customer service skills rather try to surcharge people."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go anywhere else for beauty services. I'm very picky but they do in the way exactly I want. The colour lasted until my nails grew out. They use one time tool and very very clean."}
{"text":"This is no longer Jade (thank God). The new owners and staff are wonderful. They are super knowledgeable and accommodating.   I have had manis, pedis, waxing and eyelash extensions and HIGHLY recommend them for all of these services.  I have finally found my forever nail salon!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not one to write a negative review about anything, but I felt compelled to write this one. I came in here a few weeks ago for a shellac manicure, and everything went well - I was impressed by the decor and overall feel of the salon (and excited that it was super close to my work).

However, the very next day three of my nails had chipped! I was disappointed, because a shellac manicure should NOT chip that quickly.  I went back to the salon and asked them to fix it, which they did without an issue, and I was again impressed by their customer service and overall attitudes. 

But THEN - after they redid both of my hands, the polish started peeling off within a few hours of visiting for the repair. Not sure if it's the quality of the product they use, but I'm overall disappointed and definitely will not be going back there. A $40 shellac manicure should last longer than two days."}
{"text":"I love Beaute D'Amour, Demi and her staff are wonderful, very knowledgeable and accommodating. I'm very picky about my nails and I can say that Demi pays amazing attention to every detail. Prices are clear and reasonable, I can't imagine going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very happy with their service! 
I had to have a few nails repaired. They did a beautiful job and the staff were very accommodating. Also very reasonably priced!"}
