{"text":"I really wanted to love it but it fell short.  Service was good and interior is great but here are the points they need to work on:
- small portions relative to price 
- kafta and meat chunks are bland, dry and quality of meat is on the poor side 
- fries were on the cold side and not crispy at all
- mixed plate leaves alot to be desired including presentation 

Overall we will not be back unfortunately"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to give this place a try because I love middle eastern food, but I regret trying it out after today.

My bill had a service charge which was absolutely ridiculous. I was the only person being served at the time I was there (2 groups were leaving before I took my order and another group came once I finished my meal). When I asked the young waiter what the service charge was for and if it included tip, he wasn't sure and mentioned it was possibly for dining in. I've dined in many places in the area and downtown by myself and this was the first time ever that I was billed a service charge so I was really confused and ended up disappointed.
 
The shawarma I had was alright, but I received it a few minutes after the bell was rung so it was sitting out. It also didn't justify the $12.50 it cost as there are several other places in the area within a 5-10 min walk that you can get better tasting shawarma for under $10. I had a piece of falafel as well for $1 because I was curious how it tasted and it wasn't bad either. My issue was again with receiving it. It was available to be picked up at the same time the shawarma was too, but I didn't get it until a few minutes after I've already been eating my shawarma. I'm not going to assume why the waiter did this however I was the only person there. There definitely needs to be some improvement here.

Overall, I don't recommend this place. It's too expensive for what you get and the service charge is unnecessary."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon while in the area as I saw a sign out front advertising 2 shawarmas for 9.99. The place was not busy but we had to wait to be served. We ordered the 2 shawarmas and a mixed grill entree to go. The shawarmas were average at best. My beef one was a tad dry and my husbands chicken had barely any filling. Decent enough for the price though. The major disappointment came from the mixed grill plate. When we opened up the container at home I thought it must have been a mistake. The portion was so ridiculously small. Tiny chunks of chicken, a basic salad which had just lettuce and pickles, no dressing, no flat bread, small amount of rice which had dried out frozen vegetables mixed in?!?! For 17.99 plus tax I expect a whole lot more in an entree. Taste was average although my beef skewer was over cooked and dried out. Given that it is pretty easy to find good middle eastern/ Lebanese food in that area, I expected a lot more. Definitely no value for the $ at this place. We will most likely not return unfortunately. Sorry Bliss- you have to do better then that!"}
{"text":"Loved the fruit drink, great food. Alternative to the mainstream paramount. Highly recommended. Great service is a cherry on top."}
{"text":"Middle Eastern food is a favourite cuisine so we were keen to try this new restaurant. We were very impressed with a number of dishes on the menu. As it was take-out, we can't comment on presentation but service for take-out was excellent. The potato harrah and falafel were delicious though the tabbouleh not to my taste. Our chicken shawarma was good and contrary to other reviewers had large portions and value for the price. The piece de r√©sistance was the sublime baklava-style dessert made with pistachios and a sort of creamy layer. I have eaten in many middle eastern countries with many fabulous pastries but this was THE BEST I have ever eaten. We will definitely go back to try more of their very extensive menu and of course more of those pastries."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great prices! 

Just tried this new place for the first time. We tried the baba ghanouj as well as the beef and chicken swarma. All of it was delicious! My husband and I could not decide which we liked better, the chicken or the beef. The service was quick and friendly. They have capacity for big  groups.  

I am always happy to support great new local restaurants. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior. Good menu with lots of options. Halal. Family run and service was good. The manakeesh and kebbeh was delicious. Got the platter of chicken kofta beef kebab and beef kofta with fries. The portion wasn't great for the price and meat was slightly overcooked. Overall I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Calling all east-enders!! This hidden in plain sight gem serves up so scary good fresh Hummus and Moutabbal (roasted eggplants and tahini) with the freshest and fluffiest out of the tandoor bread! 
Not going to lie, we couldn't do justice to our mixed grill entree because we ate the bread and dips like we just came off a carb free diet for a month! 
Didn't have and space left to try any dessert but the Turkish coffee was superb (think chai spiced coffee) and felt almost ceremonial as it's presented beautifully in the traditional pot and cup.

Ps: sad but the fluffy to die for bread only gets made on weekends right now"}
{"text":"The inside of this place is quite big and spacious and with its high ceilings, it looks like a banquet hall. The high ceilings also gives the affect off feeling cool and breathable. There is also alot of room stroll around inside.
Surprisingly it was not very busy when my group was there, this kind of allow us to enjoy a more exclusive dinner experience.
There are alot of options on the menu with different takes on the wraps and donairs and also there the familiar dips and flatbread appetizers.

The only few problems with the restaurant is that the way service is carried out for the customers could be organized properly and also some of the meals came out looking appealing while others looked plain, if not simple.

The stand-out dishes that I think were the Tabbouleh (very green and refreshing looking), hummus, the mezza special.
The grand high-light here is that with some of the dips, two very puffy, hot, fresh-out-the-oven pitas are also served. I was very impressed by the way they looked and I could see them being prepared and baked from our table.
I also tried a Manakeesh Beef Lam-Ajeen, ground beef with onions and diched tomatoes on a flatbread. It sounded good on the menu, but it has to be eaten as soon as it is served, otherwise as it cools, the bread base became hard, and the flavor of the toppings also weakened. I was going to take it home but forgot about it at the end of the meal.
I also tried their coffee, had a small size which came in a small copper carafe with a small tea-sized cup. I was able to get about four servings of this but it would have been good if some sugar had also been brought with the coffee. The tasted started tasting bitter after the second cup.

I also saw the Bliss Fruit Cocktail taken over to another table. It's almost like a meal on its own because this big mug was just over-stuffed with a few different types of sliced fruits. 
It would be a good choice if someone was on a detox diet and wanted to try this out has a refreshed beverage."}
{"text":"Fantastic Lebanese restaurant I really loved the food there I recommend visiting this beautiful and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and the food is good. The staff is warm and friendly. 

The reason the rating is not better is because the food was only kinda warm when we got it and it took like 40 mins for them to serve us food  :(     .....I mean, all they had to do is shave it off the roaster thingy.
 
They do not have a shawarma family platter which is odd for a Lebanese restaurant, so we ordered four Shawarma plates which was enough for probably about 6 or 8 people. It did not include hummus or tabouleh though.  I would recommended this restaurant comes up with a mixed platter including Shawarma Cuts, Falafel, hummus, tabouleh, and some kabobs.

The tahini and garlic sauces were served in little take out containers which was okay for the take-out left-overs, but not the most presentable when being served.

The customer service was good. He came around a few times asking if we were satisfied and if we need anything. They were very friendly and the place had a good atmosphere with the Middle Eastern music playing and the decor.

You can pay with credit card, debit and cash at this place.

I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try another place other then paramount. Heard about this new place so my family and I decided to order take out. First off the person answering the phone has no communication skills. Example I asked how many ppl could a mix platter plate feed and all he could say was \" I dont know I cant answer that.\" Anyways We ordered hommus, fattoush and batata harra for appetizer. The hommus was decent. We didnt get fresh bread because their bakery is closed during Ramadan which makes no sense. The batta harra was absolutely horrible literally each of us took 1 bite and nobody tried it again. Now the fattoush. Salad looked fresh but there was no sauce on it. No sauce was given to us on the side either. Didnt even bother calling to complain because when I went inside to pay and get my food the gentleman at the front was running around in panic. Now for the meal the Chicken Shawarma was ok, The lamb and beef sandwiches were way over cooked. I also ordered the fresh fruit cocktail. There was no ashta on it, there was hardly any juice in it. The mango pieces still had the skin on it. Overall absolutely horrible. Definitely will not be going back anytime Soon. I always give places especially new ones a 2nd chance so maybe in a couple months ill give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place opened not to long ago so thought the family should check it out.  We are huge fans of middle eastern food.  Went on a Sunday night at six and there was only one other family there.  Greeted by a young man-maybe the owner's kid? Pretty big menu.  We decided on the tabboleh, Greek salad and fatoush to start.  Ordered the mixed BBQ platter to split three ways. Other reviewers are right- the chicken and beef don't have much flavour. The kafta was excellent. At first the kid only brought two pitas for three people.  We had to ask twice for more bread.  Only had tiny side plates for our meal.  The kid also didn't bring my drink until half way through our meal.  Service wasn't great and food was ok.  Probably won't return.  Will stick with Armenian Kitchen."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Okay service. Wouldn't go again the menu was not special, but at the same time not completely authentic."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant seems like a family run business.
Food was ok quantity smaller then i expected
Nice restaurant setup"}
{"text":"A Restaurant that says , \" I have given you guys enough napkins\" is SCARY. Did they expect us to clean myself with my shirt ? I wonder what is happening behind the kitchen if they are this cheap?  Are they even meeting safety and hygiene standards ? I would stay away from this place."}
