{"text":"Went to Charlie's for lunch today. Got the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich. The bun was good but that was it. I am referring to the chicken as \"chicken sheet\" because that's what it looked like. Will not be returning. Sorry Charlie...."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this place not because of their food but because of the way employees are treated.  I do not eat there so cannot say anything about their food.  An employee was owed money and the owner refused to pay.  Proof of the mistake was turned in immediately and copies of check stubs were kept as proof.  It is a franchise location so corporate cannot help.  Personally I would not give this place a penny of my hard earned money!  I wish I could give 0 stars!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place. Got my sub and fries, they tasted good, one free drink refill and not super expensive. Employees were fine, zero dramas, no idea what all the fuss is about."}
