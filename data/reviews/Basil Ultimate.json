{"text":"For starters this place is FAST! Now the place was half full but they are on top of their game! I ordered the chicken pho, chicken salad rolls and a bubble tea. The bubble tea arrived no more than three minutes after I ordered it. About two minutes later my salad rolls arrived. I hadn't even started eating my second salad roll and my meal had arrived!

The PHO could feed a family of four (4). It's huge and I ended up taking a large container home. Although huge, it was really tasty! 

The Salad Rolls were tasty and the peanut sauce was spicy. YUM!

The Bubble Tea large and super tasty.

Great service as the servers helped each other out."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, the staff all have big friendly smiles. Good food, I had the sate combo. Clean and nice atmosphere. Coming back again.

They make the Vietnamese iced coffee for you so there isn't any mess on your table."}
{"text":"I've been hunting for the perfect bowl of Pho since moving to Calgary and Basil is it. 

The broth is flavourful, the amount of meat and other ingredients they put in the bowl are plentiful too.  I always order the PH1 or the PH2, the Beef Sate or Chicken Sate Pho.  

Vietnamese cooking is always focused on the  Umami and Basil gets it right with their food. The flavour balance is always spot on and the spice level is at just the right amount to make you go wow, that's spicey, but not so much as to become overwhelming so all you taste is the chili. Of course, if you're a real chili head, they include a potent chili pepper on the side of the dish should you want to kick it up a notch. 

Another favourite dish of mine is the grilled pork chop topped with a fried egg.  Fantasic dish, great flavour combo.

It's become my go to place for whenever I get the craving for Vietnamese.

9/30"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this is the best Pho I've ever had, but the food is great as many others have reviewed. The owner took effort to \"trim\" the taste of their dishes and sauces. Their Pho tastes good but not too rich or meaty as others often do. 4.5/5
The deco is one of the best amongst Vietnamese restaurants. If there's some smooth music to cover the noise of chatting, I'd give 5/5. So far 4/5 to encourage improvement!
If you like Pho or Vietnamese food, you'll like this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a little gem in northeast Calgary that boasts excellent service and food to match. 
The owners will always greet you with a smile and ensure you are taken care of right away. It gets quite busy over the lunch hour, but I have never had to wait for a table. 
They have all the staples of a Vietnamese restaurant so this is a perk if you are a creature of habit. They also have some great meal deals for groups and you get to try a variety of foods such as Pho and vietnamese style subs. 
This location used to be a Thai Thai, so the decor is similar which is always a nice touch. The only reason it lost a star is because it can get extremely loud. I prefer to go after the lunch rush so I can have a conversation with the person across from me without yelling. 
It is a great location for those who work in the NE and want a quick delicious meal! 

Oh and on a hot day, try the fresh fruit bubble tea, my fav is the honeydew melon..."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, and the meat is great quality (no globs of fat/veins)."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst pho I've had in Calgary so far, chicken with bones left in my soup....had spring rolls too they were meh! Wouldn't come here again, was trying to make the healthier choice over smash burger next door but I made the wrong choice today."}
{"text":"In YYC for a few days on business and staying in the far flung NE corner. I thought I was SOL as far as good food was concerned. So I was pleasantly surprise to find this place near the hotel. It being a colder than normal day and having been on the road the whole day, the idea of a hot bowl of Pho seemed like the perfect meal. 

I ordered the Pho Tai with an extra serving of meat. Now, having never been to Vietnam, I don't know what 'authentic' is, but I like lighter broths that are spicier rather than 'meatier'. 

That being my baseline expectation, Basil's offering was more meaty and fatty on the palate and underwhelmed me. I did not like that the one size offering (used to having a choice of Sml to Lrg bowls) and the beef was cut thicker than normal which lead to a lot of chewing and decreased my enjoyment. 

Would I go back? Sure, if I stay in this corner of Calgary again, this is where I will end up, but I am not likely to recommend it to people."}
{"text":"Had the soft spring rolls and Sate Beef Pho. Everything was very fresh and very good. Portion size was pretty big.  Total bill was a little $17. Not bad for the quality of food and great family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Well once in a while you find a place that is a star, the Pho' here is excellent and the environment is friendly... Codo was my go to, but sorry I have found a clean, open and inviting joint that serves great, filling and tasty Pho' in Basil. I look forward to the next (ok at least once a week) bowl of comfort."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this restaurant I ordered the Pho dac biet. I will never go back. We received our food but they  failed to tell us there were no bean sprouts and other condiments. The Pho came and nothing else. The food should sell itself you don't need to put \"Ultimate\" in the name of the restaurant. The Pho was decent I probably would have gone back again but the last time left a bad taste in my mouth . I usually give a restaurant one chance to impress me, they did not even try to persuade us to come back ."}
{"text":"Yum!

My husband and I were up in the NE and looking for a great place to eat. We found this through the reviews posted here on Yelp and we were not disappointed. The food was fresh and delicious and the service was friendly and attentive. We have since been back several times - travelling out of our way just to eat here."}
{"text":"Solid menu from top to bottom.  Nothing fancy but clean place and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Excellent satay Pho!! Wishing I had more, as there was only one size available. Beef was high quality, tasted very fresh. Perfect balance of spices for me. Bowl was a little pricey for the city, and does not include hot tea like many places do. But I guess you're paying for superior quality, a very friendly and smiling staff, and a beautiful restaurant. Only real negative note : an employee's kid was running around in the restaurant. It wasen't that busy, but still, some patrons could have been disrupted by that. Otherwise, excellent place to go, I'd recommend it any day!"}
{"text":"This is my #1 pho dig in town.  

I come here for pho and only pho.  Everything else is meh but because my favorite is pho, I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I like pho satay and pho bo kho but you can't go wrong with any pho on the menue.  If you want vermicelli, go to any Vietnamese restaurant...just about anyone can pull this together.  So come here for Pho and for pho only.

Service is \"what do you want, here's your food, see you at the till\" which is pretty much standard in most pho restaurants.  

There's plenty of parking out in front and a decent size restaurant to fit all you Pho lovers but come before 12 on weekdays to avoid the gazillion peeps.  

Food = 2 stars!
Ambiance = 1 star
Would I come back = hells yeah! 1 star
Would I eat another bowl after my first = for sho! 1 star
Grand total = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I was seated at my table by some guy sitting in the dining area eating his lunch. Food and drinks came super fast which was awesome but after 2 bites of trying my meal I decided it was like eating a stick of incense and pushed it off to the side. The host came by to fill my water and took my plate away. Not a question on weather or not it was good or why I did not eat any of it or even if I wanted to go. Then the bill came and I got charged full price for a meal I didn't eat. The server argued with me but eventually didn't charge me for it.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is the best Vietnamese Restaurant in the city. Their subs are amazing and their satay beef Pho is to die for. The prices are very cheap and the restaurant is clean and ran well.

GO EAT THEIR FOOD."}

{"text":"The food here was pretty good.We had the chicken pho, the beef pho, chicken stir fry, and the shaking beef. The staff was very attentive and nice. Pretty good Vietnamese food for people from San Francisco. It has been difficult finding good Asian food in Calgary. We came here because of the good reviews at Yelp, and the reviewers were right!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Sheraton Cavalier and this is about a block away. I ordered the pork spring rolls with the seafood Pho and a tiger beer. I have had Pho at a number of Viet restaurants and I have to admit I can't tell a lot of difference - I love it all. The spring rolls were crispy and hot. Service was very good. Not a lot of atmosphere, but OK. I was on a business trip and was alone so I liked having the TV on. If i was local i would probably go back."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've found in the city. Their pho is hot, ingredients are fresh. They also have some innovative noodle bowls. Clean space, fast service and nice enough staff."}
{"text":"Subs are awesome and the soup bowls were huge!  Food came quick and price was good, we'd go back."}
{"text":"I am a huge pho fan and this place meets my standards. My love affair with pho started when I was in Saigon, Vietnam, so I've had the legit stuff. I was having a massive craving, and decided to try Basil because I have heard rave reviews, and its right by work. I went around 1pm on a Friday, not busy at all. This place is really nice in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants, and that's saying a lot considering its in the hood. Family owned and operated, so really friendly staff. 

I grabbed a seat and ordered some jasmine tea and beef satay pho (as per fellow yelpers, its one of the best). I was blown away! It had a very authentic taste, and the beef was super clean, unlike some other Vietnamese restaurants I have tried in the city. It had a great peanut taste, but be prepared for a shit ton of spice (which I was not). I caught some people staring and probably wondering how the curry brown girl couldn't handle the spice, as I tried to control my cough attack. The portion size was pretty big, I couldn't finish it, but I am a tinier thing. 

I highly recommend the drive from DT (where I find the pho places not to be too stellar) to the NE for this warm treat - great on those days where that god damn chinook just won't come already."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  The place was about 1/3 full.  We were going to sit at a large table but some DB rudely said \"you can't sit there\"...whatevs DB...he jammed us at a small table against the wall.  DB move!!!

They made up for it with the food!!!  It was awesome!!!

All four of us guys enjoyed it.  I would recommend the seafood curry with rice.  It's a home run!!!  Everyone else had the vermicilli.  

Not sure if I will go back or not though.  The rudeness of the DB put a bad taste in my mouth for the overall experience."}
{"text":"I just had the best Báhn mì ever today.  Ordered the Sate chicken Báhn Mì.  I left off the hot peppers, that's too much heat for me.  The sandwich was toasted just right and the flavors inside, Wow!  They use fresh ingredients and it pays off.  The staff seated me quickly.  They were working hard.  It was just after the lunch rush, but they quickly cleaned a table and got me a menu.  I've been here many times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh, great ambiance, great staff, excellent abundant free parking. Just get rid of that TV And it would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Rating on food.

- spring rolls were good
- pork chop tasted old
- pho was okay, the broth was nothing special

Rating on service. 

- server was a bit rude
- food came out quickly 

Overall mediocre experience for a pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Second stop on my pho quest, upon recommendation from my sister (who also happened to join me) This place is brought about by the same folks from Pho Dau Bo, so I was looking to see if they would measure up.

Arriving a little earlier than the usual dinner rush, the place was understandably empty and we were greeted and seated right away. I let my sister take the reins - she ordered us spring rolls to share and a bowl of pho sate each (beef for me and seafood for her). Waiting for our piping hot spring rolls to cool, our soups were out no more than 10 mins after we ordered. I prepped my pho with the bean sprouts, fresh herbs and lime and wished I had mentally prepared myself for what I was about to embark. The broth was so AH-MAZING, the added coconut milk brought the flavors to another level! Although the sate was a bit spicier than I'm comfortable with, I powered thru the runny nose and slightly numb lips because it was THAT good.

I'm rarely in the NE, so I haven't had a chance to go back to Basil. But when I do, I'll make sure to get my sate  1/2 spicy to I can enjoy my pho that much more."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Calgary, we went to Basil for lunch this week. OMG, amazing food. I had the spicy chicken Pho and I must say it was probably the best Ive ever had. So good I couldn't stop eating until I was at the bottom of the bowl, and what a bowl, it was huge!! I cant wait to go back. Service was incredible too, I swear we ordered and in 5 minutes we were served, and I'm talking about 8 of us in our group. Didn't taste pre-made at all, super fresh. The placed was packed but folks were in and out in no time. Go there, go there now, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here on our last morning of a short weekend trip in Calgary. The restaurant is spacious, clean, and well decorated. Our orders came quickly, the beef satay pho for me, and the special combo pho for him. The beef satay pho is amazing. I was drinking the soup straight up for at least 5 minutes before I started working on the actual noodles and meat. The broth has a huge kick of spiciness, so a glass of water (or several) comes in handy. I will say prices look to be a bit more expensive than average compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. The pho definitely filled me up, but probably could have used more noodles. I'd also be interested in different cuts of meat in the beef satay, as they were a bit overdone. I do love the huge soup bowls the pho comes in, where can I get me one of those! While I didn't try anything else out from the menu, I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Should have written this a while back but I was in Calgary for a short period of time and craved some pho. There was one type of pho there that was different from everything else I've had. It had some peanut sauce and was semi spicy. Insanely good. Being that it's been so long I forgot what it was called (just read through some reviews, it's satay pho). Definitely worth a try.

Super friendly service for all us foreigners too. They were about to close and we had a party of about 30 come in at the last minute. Very friendly folks"}
{"text":"I have been crave for Vietnamese noodle soup for a while, so lucky to find this one near my hotel, I ordered Ph4 which is a combination of all kinds of beef, I also added three dollar for extra pork wonton. I enjoyed it! Great service, the bowl is huge!!!!!!! No way one person can finish them all."}
{"text":"The best vietnamese food I have ever eaten across western Canada! The service was timely, attentive and friendly. The food delivered hot and quick! The soups and subs are very delicious. We will return every time we travel into Calgary! This one is a keeper!!"}
{"text":"Pho Binh Minh used to be my favourite pho place but Pho Basil has definitely taken over this title.

The Pho Sate at Pho Basil is far superior to the one at Pho Binh Minh.  The noodles are nice texture and taste fresh.  The broth is delicious.  Hmmm ... they make Pho Sate right!

My mom also loves this place and declares it to be her favourite pho place as well.

The decor is modern and clean.  The wait staff is generally pretty friendly.  

Hmmm ... when can I go back?!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I love Vietnamese food.  I could eat this cuisine every day and never bore of it. Another thing I love? Trying new places to eat! There hasn't been one Vietnamese restaurant I have been to that tasted the exact same as another. 
So, with that in mind I am on a mission to find my all-time favorite place to eat this fine food and Basil was on the \"to try\" list!

I found the location to be a bit out of the way from where I live but on arrival I was excited. The décor was nice, it looked clean and I liked the art that was on the walls. 

I found the service to be very fast but not very personable. We ordered a B10 with a side of spring roll, an order of rocket rolls and an order of salad rolls. I enjoyed the bowl and salad rolls. I thought the rocket rolls were just ok. One of the things I thought was really neat was that the Vietnamese iced coffees were served in a \"to go\" cups which work great for me because I drink really slow and never usually finish before my meal is done.

What I did not like however and I found this to be a huge deal for me personally was the hot sauce they had on the tables was not Sriracha hot sauce or any type of Asian hot sauce at all... It was super runny and actually tasted like franks red hot... and I normally put on so much Sriracha, that I was just thinking to myself \"What is this? Where is the good stuff?\" 

The bathroom is quite tiny and I found it weird that the handicap stall was also used as a storage space for all the cleaning supplies (including a storage cabinet) and the thought that crossed my mind was \"What if someone had to get in there with a wheel chair?\" there would be no way that it would fit. 

And with that, the search continues for the ultimate Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary..."}
{"text":"Had a good meal of pho, with huge portion, and Bahn Mi, also tasty.  Odd that workers were mopping floor in middle of dinner service, but not unexpected in this kind of casual restaurant.  Full bar.  Close to airport and the Hampton Inn where we stayed, on 37th, a few blocks by car."}
{"text":"I would prefer if they had two sizes of pho like most other Vietnamese places. Then again, I suppose Basil doesn't quality as \"most others\" since their restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The pho comes in a huge bowl. Judging by the bowl and its price relative to other places (again, key word being other), I would expect more noodles and meat. When it gets busy, sometimes it's difficult to flag one of the servers down. The food is good so perhaps a 3.5."}
{"text":"Here from Texas for work and decided to have pho.  Looked on yelp for reviews and thought I'd try Basil.  I was seated at a dirty table.  After ordering a beer my waitress left the building with her things.  I'm guessing it was the owner never checked on me again.  I needed another beer and would have liked a refill on my water.  HORRIBLE service is why the bad review.  Food was okay!"}
{"text":"After hearing good things about Basil, a co-worker and I decided to pop in for lunch. 
We were greeted the second we walked in, seated and given waters. This is almost unheard of in Calgary's bustling restaurants, so it made a big impact.
I ordered the lemongrass chicken vermicelli and my co-worker got the steak pho. Our dishes were served literally a minute after we ordered! The food was extremely fresh and delicious. 
The only reason I'm taking off a star is the noise level. It was a bit difficult to hear my co-worker over the crowd. 
We didn't have to wait for the bill as they had everything ready for us up at the till.
This is a great place for lunch-time eats if you're in the NE. Definitely a must-have."}
{"text":"Service 4 Yelp
Pho soup 4 Yelp soup could have been temperature hotter.
Salad Rolls 4 Yelp
Curry beef on rice 4 Yelp

Sure I would go back."}

{"text":"I dosnt like the service there.
Expectantly the lady owner who just stand at the till look pretty and do nothing .
No greeting when we walked even no Thank you when we pay .
Such a terrible service"}
{"text":"Well.. you know this place is going to be good eats, afterall, I do believe these are the old owners of Pho Dau Bo down on International Avenue aka 17th Avenue SE aka Pho Avenue.

From friends to reviewers I know everyone loves this place, don't get me wrong the food is great -- well at least some of it is. Service is very low when the place is packed but most Vietnamese restaurants tend to be that way.

Their satay bowls are delicious, just the right amount of zing to enjoy a flavorful bowl of soup on a hot or cold day. The one thing I dislike about this place is the fact that there are only one bowl serving size.

I'm not one for the 'westernized' Vietnamese restaurants. I like having my size selection of bowls because I'm not always super starving when I go eat and in most instances a small bowl is perfect for my appetite complimented with some spring rolls and an iced coffee.

Speaking of spring rolls, I don't very much like the spring rolls at this place -- it's not that the spring rolls taste bad but it's mostly filled with carrots and is very lacking in the meat department. A good spring roll is 80% meat with 20% carrot.

This place is better to go eat at when you're with one or two people, when you're in large groups it does get kind of hectic and unorganized and through talking to other people that have eaten there it seems to be a reoccurring pattern. 

I also find prices here just a bit steeper than it needs to be, I know for one because of who the restaurant caters to as well as the fact that there is only one sized bowl.

As far as decor, ambience and atmosphere go this place did it's homework -- not that it's super high-end luxurious but they did take the time to look at their brand as a whole which I find admirable.

If I'm in the NE along 32nd avenue I will usually stop by here for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great service, very clean, very consistant food, and well priced. What more could you ask for? I've been eating at Pho Basil for years and have never had a single bad experience. You always know what you will get when you come here, Great food! 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were in the mood for Vietnamese and a Yelp search offered quite a few options in the neighborhood.  We chose this one because of some consistent reviews.

Overall, our meal wasn't bad.  The service here is good and quick, if that's what you are looking for.  We were seated immediately and always checked on.  It's also a bit more upscale in atmosphere for Vietnamese, although not fancy by any means.

The food was only OK in my opinion.  We had salad rolls, which I found extreme slimy and not really that good (1 of the 3 went uneaten).  My pork with rice wasn't too bad but not overly flavorful.  My friend had a vermicelli soup that looked pretty good and was a good portion.

Overall, while I wouldn't say there was anything wrong with our meal, I was not enthusiastic about it either.  I would probably check out a few of the other places in the area next time."}
{"text":"Had been excited to try and Basil, well, you let me down a bit! Whether or not I am in the minority, it does not mean I will come back to try again. 
Restaurant large, spacious, family run with a huge grey pit bull guarding the front patio. Guaranteed, no trouble here!
Service, meh. I think all the staff wanted to be elsewhere. Instead of all their annoying chatter about clothes and fashion, they could have used the time to clean this place up a bit.
Hubby had a shredded chicken Viet sub. Small, inexpensive, fresh and good. 3 out of 5. The baguette was fresh, flavorful cilantro, very little chicken. If you are not a a mayo lover, skip this, it did not need it.
My curry soup was a 2 star to match the service. Curry was runnier than I like it to be, the carrots were way overcooked as were the vermicelli noodles swimming in liquid curry. Almost hard to eat, the noodles were so over. Lacked that curry punch I had been craving, not seasoned enough.
Had to drive a ways to get here - it was not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5

Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

After a recommendation from a friend, we came here today for some tasty pho. I give this a 4 mostly because of their beef sate noodle soup. MMMM MMMM! Located in a little strip mall with a bright green sign, Basil is not your typical low end, grimy Vietnamese noodle house. It has a fresh, clean decor and plenty of seating for the big lunch rush. 

Their menu consists of the typical spring rolls and salad rolls as appetizers, noodle soup (pho), and vermicelli. Like most Fine ('westernized') Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, there is only one size bowl/portion, and the prices are slightly more than your average Viet restaurant. It's almost $7 for appetizers, $10 for a bowl of pho, and $9 for Vermicelli. But heck, I enjoyed my meal very much and was left satisfied and full.

I got their Beef Sate ($9.50) - Mekong style beef sate in creamy, spicy broth which was DIVINEEEEEE. Unlike most sates I've had (not spicy when it says it is, peanuty, and oily in a bad way), Basil does a fantastic job by creating a well balanced and flavoured broth of spiciness (just right for those who don't eat it a lot), that is mellowed out by a 'creamy' kind of coconut-like broth. Kind of Thai inspired - like a mellower version of Tom Yum with the coconut milk. Yes.. they could have skimmed a bit of fat off the top, but it was one broth that was worth sipping on. The portion of noodles was good (enough to make me feel full but not that I will fall asleep going back to work), and not overly salty or laddened with MSG. I didn't have to reach for a liter of water after! Highly recommend it! 

Their service kinda sucks, despite us being there before the lunch rush. Sure..once we were seated we were served water immediately, but it took them 5-10 minutes too long to realize we were ready to order. The food however, was prepared quickly but with careful consideration. 

Overall, if you're in the area come here and you must try the Beef Sate!"}
{"text":"Here is a delicious place for some pho located in the NE of Calgary just off Barlow Trail and 32 avenue. The short and sweet of this place is...

The restaurant is very clean and presentable. The pho is actually quite tasty and well proportioned. Unfortunately they only have one size. Prices are decent for a Pho restaurant and their sate soup actually has sate flavour, unlike other restaurants that usually just put hot sauce/oil into your soup. I ordered the Pho Dac Biet with sate soup and it was quite enjoyable.

Come on by for a taste. The soup was good, not great, it could have had more flavour but it wasn't the worse that I've ever tasted. In my opinion, it is a worthy bowl of pho in Calgary. It is really tough to write a lot about pho since pho is pho... so if you have never tried it before, just head on out to your local neighbourhood pho restaurant and try some."}
{"text":"My fave! Love the beef salad rolls. Easy to take out or stay in. Generous portions & fair price. Delish!"}
{"text":"My NUMBERRRR ONE spot in the North East. 

I love their spicy sate (PH1). Like SOOO DELICIOUS. Piping hot and SPICY, SPICY, SPICY. Take my word, I like heat, and this is hot. 

It's always busy at lunch; but they have excellent lunch service, very efficient. Easy to get in and out of within 45-60 minutes. Definitely get the family owned experience. I've been going here for about 3 years... and mmm crave it all the time. 

I also have tried their subs, which I really enjoyed the bread they used. Tasted very fresh. And their fresh fruit bubble teas are a great price. Oh, and their (Vietnamese) iced coffee -- keeps you going all afternoon, no 2pm crash."}
{"text":"Another one of my fav pho spots. I usually go for the pho sate ga and believe me the portions are hugeeee but flavourful. Every pho place has a slightly different soup and I really enjoy this one. I recently tried their passion fruit bubble tea and it was so yummy. You have to try it. 

The place is spacious with comfortable seating. Most of the staff is really friendly and patient and we always feel welcome. We did get some annoyed looks from one the ladies once don't know why (the owner..I'm guessing)  and we thought she was just tired or something but it happened the second time as well. However, with such amazing food and other friendly staff we will continue coming :)"}
{"text":"As a fat white guy I would call my self a professional connoisseur of fine Vietnamese, now you might say to me: \"But wait Brandon I thought you didnt try Viet food for your first time until you where almost 23?\" And you would be technically correct, but that isnt going to stop me from telling perfect strangers that they make a good bowl of soup and grill a mean quail. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was I wasnt super impressed with the bubble tea."}
{"text":"My friend Vanessa and I were going to try out Noodle King but it closed at 4pm. I then recommended Basil.  I've never been before but the reviews I've seen we're all positive so I brought it up. 

If I could give 3.5  I would but they are still worth a 4.

They get 1 whole star for their atmosphere and deco. From the menu to the floors and art on the walls.  You can tell this Viet place was a bit more upscale then the regular run downs. Also the food is $1-3  more than regular Viet places. 

The other 3 stars are broken down.... 

2 stars for the food.. 

A1 Shrimp Summer Rolls - The wraps were fresh, soft and moist.  You can tell the rolls were made to order 

A7 Rocket Shrimp Rolls - Super yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Giant tiger shrimp and taro paste wrapped and deep fried. 

P3 Seafood Sate Noodle Soup - Didn't try it but it had a lot of seafood  shrimp, crab stick, squid etc.. my friend loved it. The bowl was HUGE and you get a lot 

B1 Bun - Grilled Pork and Spring Rolls -  Generous portions and Pork was tender and cooked just right.  I asked for no bean sprouts... and I was sad to see that there were bean sprouts. I had to pick them out one by one... arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  gosh I said no bean sprouts in a clear bold tone and they still put bean sprouts.

I wasn't too happy with their Avocado shake... it wasn't sweet enough and I had to ask for more sugar.  Also I think it needed more avocado. Good size though. Totally worth the $$$$

Finally the LAST star is for the service. I needed HOT WATER for my baby's bottle and they were so quick and helpful  I like that :)"}
{"text":"I used to come to Basil all the time. They would be known for their great quality Vietnamese food as well as for their generous portion sizes.

Today I came in and ordered the pho dac biet, spring rolls and orange juice and was disappointed with the amount of meat I had in my pho. I did bring it to the waitresses attention before I started to dig in, she then waved the manager over and their response was that all bowls get the same amount of meat.

Honestly, if I'm paying nearly $10 for a bowl of pho.. I expect a decent amount of beef and beef balls in it. My pho had maybe 1/3 of a beef ball cut in small pieces.

And EVEN IF that was the usual amount of meat they put in their pho, they could have dealt with the situation in a different way.. Could have told me that it was normal amount of beef and maybe mention extra beef costs however much and offered me that..

Anyways, I used to enjoy eating at basil and because of the chincing of the meats in the pho, I'd rather go to the dozens of other Vietnamese restaurants located in the NE."}
{"text":"My husband picked this place.  He wanted to eat 'healthy'  and try something new.    He checked out menu and saw the salad rolls.  And the subs.  So off we went thinking salad rolls and subs but we got there and the aromas on this humid, rainy overcast cool summer day  were so enticing,  he had us opting for Pho instead.   He had the regular seafood pho and I had the spicy one.   I was impressed that the Fresh Basil, lime and bean sprouts came on a  side plate to add to our soup.   The chunks of shrimp, scallop and squid were generous and there were faux-pho crab sea legs, but hey,  it's still seafood!   

I loved the cilantro/lime/basil tastes in my Pho and it was spicy.  Nose runny spicy in some spoonfuls, but it was so good,  I just kept eating.

The portion was large enough I brought some home for my daughter to try.  Hah, once she gets a mouthful of that lovely broth,  guess who else will be a Basil-fan!

Those salad rolls are the best I've had, ever!   I will go there again for those alone, because it's so rare you find a salad roll with such flavour combinations and fresh, fresh wraps!   Seriously they were so fresh they were still sticky.   Some people might find that annoying,  I find that an indicator the wraps didn't come out of the fridge to sit on a counter for hours!

I can hardly wait to try what those other people were having!   Vermicelli with some other types  of accompaniment.   

Oh, and the service?   Excellent.   From the quick seating and table clean up and service and promptness of the food service,  I love this place for service.   Even though it was pretty busy we had our choice of tables in one area.

My yelp is a yelp of joy today.  I found Pho in my neighbourhood that is equally as fresh as the first Pho I had that was made by a friend's mother back in Vancouver before Pho was a found food!"}
{"text":"With the good reviews on Yelp, I had to try this place for the first time.  I ordered the Beef Sate Pho.  The first thing that I noticed was the portion size.  It is on the small side, and with the price you are paying it should have more noodles.  As for the taste of the Beef Sate Pho, it is better than the average Beef Sate Pho in town but definitely not the best.  There are so many different vietnamese restaurants around the area that it just doesn't stand out from the crowd, except for the price and portion size (in a negative sense)."}
{"text":"Super awesome pho!

I think by now I am a conesiuer of the pho, this place didn't disappoint. 

Found it on Yelp. Great reviews. This place was jammed for lunch. Was super fast tho!  Lottery took 60 seconds for our salad rolls which were very fresh. Crispy lettuce fresh!

The slips came out in about 3 minutes!  Awesome pho, and my gf had the spicy beef satay ph1&ph6. Both were massive and tasty for only $10. 

Definitely one of the best.  Great service and super clean as well. Basil is a gem."}
{"text":"Delicious vermicelli.  After walking by several times during lunch, I decided to drop in and check this place out.  I was quite impressed, a large comfortable interior, quick service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! I had a great experience here. I had the Pho Tai which was the one with rare steak! The broth was rich and I enjoyed it. Also had the Bun Num Nuong, Cha Gio, it was simple. The pork sausage has a lovely lemongrass note it was simple! Pure unadulterated nothing crazy! Popular amongst local Viet and Calgarians in general. For sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"How can a place be in business when it's kitchen closes at 5.30 pm ??? And this is a Saturday night ???? Great reviews too bad I wasn't able to check it out :( had to move on to another restaurant for my Vietnamese fix ...."}
{"text":"I can't believe how fast the service is! As soon as we were seated there was water in the table and menus in our hands. The second you close your menu someone is there taking your order. It was amazing! The food then also arrived promptly and it is really really really good pho! 
I stuck with just the classic beef and noodle pho and was not disappointed. It hit the spot on a rainy, damp day. 
The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect, nothing exceptional but it's clean and tidy. 
Definitely give this place a try if you're a lover of pho, or even a first timer."}
{"text":"I've been to Basil a couple of times over about an 8 month period.  Both experiences have been pretty much the same.  

When I arrived there appeared to be a number of young guys just hanging out on the side walk in front of the restaurant.  Talking and smoking.  A little unnerving, but not threatening.

As I walked in, I was greeted by the host that was sitting down and eating.  Even though there seems to be a plethora of staff, apparently there is only one person that can direct you to a table.  Even though all they do is point to one, they don't actually walk you to it.

The server taking my order was quick to take it and then depart.  Neglecting to ask me if I wanted anything to drink, or any appetizer, etc.  Some might call this punctual, I call it distracted/short/curt (you see the point here).  

I ordered a B6 (Lemongrass Chicken with spring rolls over vermicelli) this time, and the time previous PH1 (Beef Satay).  Meals were delivered very quickly (5 stars for quick delivery).  

In both instances, the food was pretty much average.  I've had worse Vietnamese food, I've had better.   The food does come out hot and is fresh.  However, flavour is meh.

Once I was finished, no one had bothered to provide me a bill, so I proceeded to the desk where the cash register was to pay for my meal.  The person in charge of the cash, was on the phone (not speaking English, so it was hard to tell if this was a business or personal call, I'm thinking personal).  The person barked the total to me without providing any details of the bill, and once paid, the credit card receipt was ripped from the machine, handed to me and my business was concluded.  (Correct, there was no \"Thank You\").  

If you are looking for a place to have a quick and very average Vietnamese meal, look no further.  Just don't expect any of the common courtesies (like hearing the words \"Thank you\").  Service is prompt, but the staff seem distracted and there is plenty of chatting amongst themselves.

5 stars for quick food service,
4 stars for atmosphere (place is clean and bright)
2 stars for very average food
1 star for attentive staff

Would I go back, sure.  I know the next visit will be pretty much the same as the last couple.  And its good if you want something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Busy at lunch.  Helpful and friendly staff.

Very good satay beef subs.  Also the vermicelli bowls are tasty.

They have bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Definitely at the top of my list for Pho. We'll priced, served fast for your lunch break and very filling. You have to try their Pho. I've never tried anything else because the Pho is that good."}
{"text":"After being rejected by a high rated Resturant for not having a reservation (although their site on yelp said not needed), we decided to try Basil.  It was delicious!  Even our kids enjoyed it.  Granted, we are not experts of Vietnamese food, we thought this was a great first experience.  The waitstaff was extremely helpful in explaining the dishes and what was in them.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really like the pho amd spring rolls here.  A bit pricy compared to other pho places but it is well worth the extra money.  It was packed when I came during lunch time and managed to get a small table.  Service was decent with everyone hustling around to get food out and clear tables.  

Everything about the noodles, soup, meat etc was good.  No complaints here.  If I had to pick out something...  the hot sauce was a bit runny so didn't use it.  Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Eating in front of customers not thanks.  The seafood was dry and tasted old. The spring rolls was ok but I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"The quality of food is pretty good  many of their dishes have plenty of flavour.  I only give them 3 stars because their portions dont give the food enough value for the amount they charge. A bowl of pho is $8.50 & it does not even remotely fill u up. I'll honestly say tho, I've had better pho elsewhere. They just msg the crap out of their dishes & people will say they've got great food. It's the 36 & under crowd that gives it so much praise. (Mostly because we don't know how to cook, but those of us who do know better...wink wink.)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their pho satay.  This is close to my house and it's usually a place where you can grab a quick bite.  I usually get the vegetarian pho satay (the broth is not vegetarian).  They have a decent vegetarian menu but the pho broth is not."}
{"text":"This is probably as good as it gets here in Calgary for pho.  It's clean, it's delicious and prices are very reasonable. My girlfriend is a bit of a pho aficionado and this place has her stamp of approval. And we've been to a lot of places.  

We've been here many times already and it's consistent.  The broth of the pho hits the spot. Portions are large.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Review #10 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

When you're not really all that hungry but you're at least a little bit hungry and should probably put a little something in your belly so you're looking for something that's light on the stomach but filling enough so you won't be hungry twenty later, what do you go for? Vietnamese!

That's exactly how I ended up at Basil Ultimate Pho. We were in the NE, I didn't want to take our new Calgary visitor into Forest Lawn JUST yet... so Yelp reviews let us here. Well, we ran into another friend just outside, and she was all like \"Meh, it's ok. I come here because it's close to work. I know the other Yelpers seem to like it a lot but... meh.\" And on that note, we proceeded inside.

Inside, it's bright and clean and pretty new looking. No dodgy NE stuff happening here. The menu is quite varied with curries and pho and vermicelli dishes and stir fries and other things of typical Vietnamese nature. I ordered Lemongrass chicken with pork spring rolls on vermicelli noodles. It was... ok. The spring rolls were good... hot and nice and crispy. The lemongrass chicken was a solid 3.5 stars I'd say. 

We also ordered shrimp salad rolls... but they never showed up to the table. And when we were ready to leave, the staff were enthralled with something on the TV.

At any rate... atmosphere good. Staff is friendly, but sometimes forgetful. Food is decent, though if you're a Vietnamese food fanatic, there are probably other spots you'll want to try first."}
{"text":"Their pork chop stinks! - the server's attitude is bad. 

We ordered 3 BBQ pork chop dishes - the meat smells like hell! We pointed it out didn't expect a refund or anything - the waiter/owner guy was kind of mad and not wanted to admit that.

A no-go place for sure."}
{"text":"Basil is located on 32nd Avenue NE of Calgary in a little strip mall area, their sign is green and it can be easily missed.

I work nearby so I've been here a few times.. although, its been a while so when my co-worker asked me out for lunch I chose Basil because she hasn't been there yet.  We went on a Wednesday lunch hour.  The parking lot is pretty big because its a strip mall area but around lunch its usually packed.  When we entered, we were winded by a fresh pho scent. \"Mmm, thats smells deelicious!\" she said.  Basil was quite packed, so we had to wait for them to clear a table.

We got sat within 10 minutes and glanced at the menu.  We both wanted some Vermicelli.  Robin went with the B1 which was vermicelli, pork, bean sprouts, greens and two spring rolls.  I went with the B6 which was the same thing but with lemongrass chicken instead.  We also got different drinks, I got the D9 which is a coconut 3 color drink and Robin got the strawberry bubble tea (which isn't on their menu so you have to ask!).   The food didn't take too long to come which was surprising because of how busy it was.  The vermicelli comes with a side of fish sauce to pour over.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy and the vermicelli was delicious, I love the bean sproats because it adds a nice crunch!!  I found the meat a teeny bit dry but other than that, everything was good.

I find the service a bit sloppy, kind of a drop and go.  But I guess the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Quick service, reasonable prices, and amazing food! 

The beef sate sub comes in a deliciously crunchy baguette with a generous amount of meat. Their broth is very flavorful and not fishy. Everything was very well made and delicious. I was slightly disappointed with the beef in the pho - it was kinda stringy, not the best cut of beef.

They're packed on weekdays at lunch so come before 11:45am to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli. The springs rolls were delicious and the sauce was really good too. The issue was with the pork. It was sooooo salty and they didn't use good cuts of meat because several of the chunks had so much fat on them it was unappetizing so I wound up discarding several pieces. Also the carrots tasted like regular carrots they didn't pickle them at all from what I could tell. 

The place itself is clean and they were fast with my order and also very friendly. I would go back and maybe get salad rolls. I wouldn't go out of my way and wasn't super impressed based on the reviews I read. There are much better in the city."}
{"text":"This review is based on their bubble tea only:
Had a hankering for a bubble tea after going to smashburger. Stopped in to this location next door. Restaurant was clean and inviting as was the staff. 
Ordered my tea and proceeded to watch the most unprofessional handling of food I've ever seen. The lady scooped the pearls into my cup and then took a spoonful for herself into her mouth. Umm...ok. She blended my mixture and poured it into my cup and then did the same thing. Took the spoon and ate some of the mixture that didn't fit into my tea. 
You just don't do this!

Plus the price was $6.50 for this. The most expensive tea I've ever purchased. 

The tea itself was very weak in flavour, almost watered down. And the pearls were horrible! Undercooked? I don't know if they're cooked or what. But they were very chewy and hard like in the centre. Like very raw pasta. 
I'll not return."}
{"text":"Best Pho sate in Calgary! Also their pork spring rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times but yesterday was the first I sat down in the restaurant. 

The service was awesome! They were pretty busy they sat us right away. The food came within ten minutes or so and tasted awesome! 

The price is on par for the quality and the service. 

I will for sure be going here again!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here alot. The tables are clean, and the portions are good. Good satay noodles and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Ugh, Beef Satay to make you scream \"Hey Hey HEYYY\"
So freaking delicious, and such amazingly huge portion sizes!  If you're a lover of PHO, come to BASIL in the NE, you won't regret it.  The service was fast, the restaurant is nice, clean, and the beef in the soup is perfection.  No gristle, my nizzle.  That's what Snoop Dogg would say.  Wait, isn't he SNOOP LION now?  But I digress.  I can't WAIT to get my arse back to BASIL.  I actually saved my leftovers last time and brought them home for next day lunch.  Weee"}
{"text":"My very first time trying Pho and it was lovely! Fresh ingredients, good flavor. From order to table was 3 minutes and they were constantly doing rounds to refill waters etc. Would definately try it again!"}
{"text":"I'm by no means a Vietnamese food coonosier but I couldn't find one thing to complain about this meal. Very flavorful, staff was friendly and the price seemed very fair. I ordered the Ph5 Rare Steak Pho and A1 Shrimp salad rolls. Everything tasted light, fresh and delicious."}
