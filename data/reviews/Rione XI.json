{"text":"This place earns the highest praise I can give: my wife compared it to the food she loved in Rome. Great pizza and pasta dishes served perfectly. 

The bread was exceptional. Dense, soft interior and a crust that has a perfect bite."}
{"text":"Excellent food, attentive and friendly service.  The fried artichokes and meatballs were delicious, and the beef cheek was incredible, served with delicious mashed potato and truffle oil.  The cheesecake is a must.  Great addition to the St Clair strip."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant after it replaced Pizza e Pazzi. The food was good, but not great. The service was, likewise, good but not great. For two adults and two children the bill was slightly more than $100. I had the beef cheeks, and the meat portion was small to say the least. No one at the table was particularly excited about their food. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Good crusty bread, good fried artichoke appetizer, and very generous on the delicious cheese on our pizzas. The server/owner was friendly, occasionally checking up on how our meal was going. No, he wasn't particularly chatty, but I think its just personality - he's definitely not outgoing, but he was nice! 

The downside is that we ordered a mushroom pizza which the menu described as featuring multiple types of mushrooms. When the pizza actually came, it had only white button mushrooms (the most inexpensive type) and even then, it was very scarce. I'm talking maybe eight thin slices of them - not eight mushrooms, eight *slices*...like, a total of maybe two whole mushrooms. They could argue that the amount of good quality cheese makes up for it, but then at least take out \"different types\" from the description. 

Other than that, food was actually decent. I'd be willing to come back."}

Service: 6/10
-friendly but not that warm welcome. The owner is a great gentlemen, but not that good as a waiter:)

Food: 8.5/10
-Carciof all giudia : 6.5/10
Its appearance worths a 10 out of 10. But it tastes special. Really special. I personally not really like the flavour or say not used to, but it depends on ppl. Lemon is the turning point!
-Guance Di: 9/10
Beef is so great!!!
-Margherlta: 9/10
Very thin and crispy. The tomato sauce on the pizza is great.

Food amount: 8.5/10 (10 means a lot)

Environment: 9/10
Warm and beautiful design. Quite sentimental. Good for dating:)"}
{"text":"Rione XI is a new Italian restaurant that focuses on dishes from the Roman Jewish ghetto. This is not another sleek or gimmicky Toronto food-trap. This is a St. Clair West neighbourhood spot with authentic dishes in a relaxed setting. 

I tasted some of the dishes (e.g. stracotto pasta) and am enthused to try more! I particularly enjoyed the sharing boards. One of them featured simply prepared fresh ingredients like creamy burrata on crostini, heirloom tomatoes, white anchovies and grilled radicchio. 

My highlight was the rucola e scaglie di parmigiana. It's a plentiful board overflowing with arugula, lemon wedges, shaved parmesan and the star: the bresaola, which is used instead of the usual proscuitto. Try this with your bread, olive oil and wine on the side. You will taste that the food at Rione XI is prepared with love."}
{"text":"Was here last night. Two (very) pregnant ladies, one with celiac disease (gluten makes her acutely sick). The server was a bit of a jerk and not very helpful when asked what on the  menu might be gluten-free. Food was good. Service continued to be rude and inattentive. 

Fast-forward to next day, wife has stomach cramps and vomiting. Called to ask if there was raw egg in her pasta (there was) and the guy I got (sounded like it could have been the same server as before) was a complete jerk on the phone about everything.

So now we get to sit here an worry about whether she has salmonella from a raw egg. 

Not going back."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for something savory with garlic. 

We were greeted by a very welcoming young lady from Rome who allowed us to sample some of the dishes.

After sampling, we knew we needed to take a seat :) We learned the chef was Italian so we were excited to try. 

Had the mushroom risotto and the artichoke pasta with shrimp sauce.  Exactly what we were looking for, full of flavour, the pasta was el dente and made in house.

The bread was definitely the best I've tried.  Stuffed with cherry tomatoes, with a moist cente and a rustic crust.  Forgot to ask if you can buy it by the loaf.

Next time I want to try the deep fried stuffed meatballs!

Overall, a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Four and a half stars. Great place. I was socked and disappointed when I came looking for pizza e pazzi and saw it was gone, but this is their \"sister restaurant\" and was very very yummy. A bit pricey but yummy and great service."}
{"text":"Huge portions!  I ordered the beef cheek tagliatelle and there was more meat than pasta in the dish, amazing!  Also, had the pan fried artichokes, highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the st.clair - Bathurst neighbourhood. Great Italian food with amazing service. It wasn't very crowded which was nice for a change in this neighbourhood. Worth a second visit!"}
