{"text":"2 old grumpy owners! burgers are much better at McD's! will never go back and do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for one final meal from here after work but turns out they sold out of food earlier on. Closed forever. They will be greatly missed. Ive been going there for 23 years :( Fwiw the owners have always been friendly and crack smiles + jokes. You just need to figure out the code to be granted that privilege. Wish I recorded just one of the classic onion ring orders to hear that, 'just one ehhh' again lol."}
{"text":"amazing burgers but a bit NON-freindly owners, they're nice but a bit tired all the time. but best burger around."}
{"text":"An old school burger join, worth checking out. They're open late (usually until 2am), so it's pretty convenient if you fancy a late night snack. Don't expect the best burger or customer service. Order the double burger, since the single is too thin. They are very conservative with toppings, so make sure to ask for extra. Also don't be too picky, or else the owner will give you a death stare (or likely ignore you). Don't miss out on the fries.   In short, a decent burger for a decent price. Just don't set your expectations too high."}
{"text":"This is a feel good burger joint, where you go if you don't want to make dinner. Been there for iver 50 years and is family owned and run. You're not going there for the ambiance and decor but great food and good company. Always a good stop with a team after a win or loose game. They have beer on tap and a tv to watch sports. Burgers are straight forward and to the point no fancy schmancy ordering like when you're at Starbucks. They're juicy and fries or onion rings go great with anything. Prices are very reasonable. Definitely a great good eat"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. Food was just ok, the 2 guys that have worked there since I was a kid need to smile. Hey what about debit or visa? If your that unhappy call it a day and sell the land."}
{"text":"Well what can I say. It's a trip to the 80's alright. I personally think that the place needs to be a little updated. Although the food (burgers and fries) are good, the choice for toppings is limited. The cook doesn't wear gloves when preparing food. Both of the guys that were working today don't look happy at all to be here. Have some sort of attitude.   No debit/credit. Cash only. They do have an ATM machine on site, but who wants to pay extra fees for withdrawal and than bank fee?!  Overall..... Although people say it's busy at night, it was the first and the last time for me."}
{"text":"It's all about the atmosphere. This place looks like an old rundown diner with 2 Greek guys that can't break a smile if their lives depended on it. Definitely one of my favourite places in Richmond hill."}
{"text":"** Unfortunately Closed **  Hopefully that stop remains an area for a nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to steer inn twice so far and both times I was in burger heaven. The burgers were nice and juicy and the fries were really good too. The only downside is that the people running the place is not that nice. Other than that it's a nice place to grab a bite once in a while."}
{"text":"As much as i like a greek or macedonian owned burger joint in and around Toronto, this place is disgusting.  It was dirty, even the female owner had an apron that was dirty, they had fly's flying around, broken or missing tiles, orange decor from the 60's ....... and not a great burger.   They need to renovate and spend some bucks, also the staff weren't very friendly.....every town has a mom and pop burger joint but i feel sorry for people who live in Richmond Hill.   Don't waste your money, not even close to Tom's in Markham or Golden Star in Thornhill."}
{"text":"This is def an old school place in Richmond Hill.  The place is very small like the size of my garage. Like 10 tables.  The guys that work here are super cool thou. Everytime I visit they treat me well and chat with me.  The burger is good with fresh ingredients.  Same as the fries which can be a little too salty.  The best thing is that it open late so I can swing by anytime I have a craving for some greasy food."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Te joint is overpriced for the quality of food.  Burger and fries were nothing special. Onion rings too greasy. Chicken nuggets were close to the worst I have ever had. Won't be going back for sure."}
{"text":"My daughter sends me a link explaining how (yet another) condo is being built, now on the site where Steer Inn Burgers is. And, they are going to reconstruct from the same restaurant, the New Steer Inn on top of the condo that is going on this piece of land. Ok, seriously? That will never happen. When the land is turned into a condo, and unfortunately, that will indeed happen. It will be the end of Steer Inn. Before I tell you what to order there, let me continue. The fellows who work the grill, have been there forever. When I read this lying link about the reconstruction, I went for lunch to Steer Inn to find out what's going on. I guess from the response to my question, these guys are being bombarded with the same question. The guys there do NOT own the land that the restaurant is on. If/when it does go, so do they. One fellow is 70 years old. Working keeps him going. And he does work hard. So, when they finally cooled down, they explained to me that this internet story is a bunch of crap. And indeed, if/when they close, they will then be forced to enjoy some retirement. My burger joint finally came to a close many years ago, \"Hamburger King\" just north of Glencairn on Bathurst, on the east or west side, depending on your time line. Once these comfort food places are gone, they are not replaced. Ok, enough, the food: Burgers are great, not the smash type, but still a great burger. The fries (must have with gravy,) are home cut. The onion rings are second to none in the city. If you are a fan of rings, go for that alone. Souvlaki on a bun is always delicious. Chicken fingers and fries are real chicken, not those nugget thingies. Give it a try before it is gone. When its gone, it will not be on top of a condo. It will be going places way higher than that.........sadly.  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g181740-d982045-r336664518-Steer_Inn-Richmond_Hill_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"I'll tell ya, it's very comforting knowing you have a stellar burger joint within 2.4km of your house. I've heard rumours that Steer inn has been around for 60 years. Whether or not this is true I don't know, but I do know it's been around for 30+ and there's a reason why it hasn't moved or closed down.    This greasy spoon is known for their burgers and onion rings. In addition to the former, they offer steaks, souvlaki and chicken fingers etc. etc. But really you don't wanna mess with any of that if you hit up this joint. For as long as I can remember, they've always had the 2 grumpy old men working in there. I swear, every time I go in there they barely look at you at any point. Act as politely as you can! You'll be lucky to get a smile or word out of them. Nonetheless, solid solid burgers and onion rings.   I highly recommend the Banquet Burger (bacon & cheese) and greasy as folk onion rings. The Banquet Burgers are deliciously cooked patties, and I've said it once and I'll say it again and again, the BUN is one of the most important aspects of a burger to me (Johnny's!). Steer in has these larger than normal square shaped buns that are so light and fluffy (Johnny's!). It truly transforms the meal for me.    Probably gonna hit Steer Inn for lunch now, lol.   Please note: Johnny's forever remains the best burgers I know of in the GTA."}
{"text":"The burger was a complete disaster. The patty was as thick as the bacon strip and somehow it was ready just in two minutes on a day that no one was in the diner. I can confidently say that it was the worst burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"***** Onion rings ARE the best! \"the 2 guys\" have run the place for at least 25 years... yeah, I'm old :) The home fries served with breakfast are REAL and tasty.   No, I've NEVER seen an episode of: coughing; sneezing; runny noses; or any other body fluids... on or toward food. I guess anyone could have a bad day now & then tho.   Let's face it, it IS A \"GREASY SPOON\" and I'm glad 'cause they're hard to find :)  If they ever start wearing plastic gloves... well, might as well head off to McD's or a some other crappy franchise"}
{"text":"Its not bad. The food itself tastes pretty good and the onion rings are godly.  Service is quick, but very unpleasant. they basically have a mermaid man/ barnacle boy duo, but they are most certainly not heroes, pretty grumpy all the time.  The location is ghetto as hell, which i dont care about personally, but just letting you know.  Pricing was alright, i felt like it could've been a bit cheaper though.   Would i go back? Yes, every once in a while. When im bored of cancerous mcdonalds and burger king burgers."}
{"text":"This is a really old diner. It feels like you just stepped out of the DeLorean after driving at 88MPH!! You can notice that in everything from the decor to the cash register. It brings back some nostalgic memories for me. It also reminds me of diners in Chicago. I ordered fish & chips and it was OK. Downside of being an old diner is that they only take cash (they do have an ATM though) and there is no WiFi. But hey its the 80s, what did you expect??"}
{"text":"Super old school diner. Steer Inn definitely has character given that they still have their original red and orange diner booths! Pricing is very reasonable - the portions are very big for low prices! The cheeseburgers that we had were huge! Along with the French fries, we ended being quite full and satisfied with our dinners (the cheese burgers weren't anything special but they did their job of filling us up). Not too thrilled about the fact that it is cash only and the unfriendliness of the staff (but then again, Steer Inn has unusually long hours so it's understandable that customer service isn't exactly priority). Overall, it's a place to consider if you're craving for some late night, greasy diner food."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to this little blast from the past, when I first entered this time warp, I had to say, the decor was horrible, the seats were all torn up, broken and just uncomfortable to sit in. Female server was super nice, the cooks, were, unique, but my god were they masters on the grill. Banquet burger was my go to, with everything on it, exept for hot peppers. OMG it was absolutely delicious, the patty even being super thin, is packed with flavour, and cooked to perfection. Side order of house made fries, that were crunchy on the outside, but oh so soft on the inside, just like the cooks. When I discovered they were being closed, I'll admit it, I cried, I cried some manly man tears, crocodile tears.  In all seriousness this place has left a hole in the Richmond hill community, I wish the cooks a long and relaxing retirement, I didn't know this place as long as I should have, but your diner will be sorely missed."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Steer Inn today and was shocked to read the notice posted on the door advising that this burger joint was permanently closed.  I feel as though another small piece of me died.  My son and I have been customers of this place since it first opened.  It was always fun to go there because all of the staff/owners knew my son and I by sight.  We always felt welcome there and I used to give all of the staff a hard time in a joking manner and we all had a good laugh while the food was being prepared on the open grille.  The Inn was famous for its onion rings. I have never encountered better rings anywhere and I have eaten in a lot of places over my 72 years of life. The food was consistently good.  I never, ever had an unsatisfactory meal and the prices were always fair.  Over the years, we talked about what would happen if the land finally sold to someone who was going to develop it but we always though that it would be a far off happening because the size of the property was so small.   Places like the Steer Inn are almost non-existent these days and that is a shame.  There was something very comfortable about the Steer Inn.  The decor was terrible but we did not care because we knew that it was foolish to spend thousands on a renovation when the writing was on the wall.  So the orange shabby-chic booths were overlooked because we did not come there for interior design ideas......we came for the food and the warm atmosphere.  To those who did not encounter the sort of friendly service they thought they should, then I am sorry to hear that happened.    I truly wish that I had known that they were going to shut down because my son and I would have liked to have one more visit and say our goodbyes and heartfelt thanks for all the years they provided us with excellent food.  They will be sorely missed."}
{"text":"I hope this mom and pop isn't run only by a mom and pop. The hours run 6:30 am until 2 am weekdays with a 3 am closing Thu-Sat. Dudes!  A double cheeseburger and fries runs you about $8. They have a compelling $5 breakfast.   The burger won't win any awards. It's a very Harvey's experience. The fries are exceptional although you might find you need to add a touch of salt.  The number of parking spots seem to exceed the number of tables by a factor of 10. I suspect there are a lot of late nighters who park and mow down in or on their cars. Seating is fairly limited and pretty old school. This place probably hasn't seen a reno in decades."}
{"text":"Old school place, emphasis on the old. Nothing special about the burger, fries or gravy I had. For a place that has lasted as long as this one apparently had I figured it would be a least close to places like Tom's Diner or Johnny's.  But nope. Two stars is maybe a little high, but the owners were very nice folks so they get a slight bump up for that."}
{"text":"Nothing was special about this place at all its your typical old school burger joint, probably opened back in the days where i wasnt even born I can say the burgers are similar to harveys which is just 2 mins away from this place Pretty pricy if you ask me for the type of rundown burger joint This will be my first and last time here Johnny burgers is way better"}
{"text":"There is a lot of character to this place. I've been coming here since I was a kid. The burgers aren't as large as they used to be, but they are still delicious. Toppings are fresh and so are the buns for the burger.  The staff has been there for ages and add to the experience!  Always a good choice when you are craving a local greasy and delicious burger."}
{"text":"Steer Inn is one of those places - if you've grown up eating it - it's an institution and the food will have nostalgic meaning.   If you haven't, this place is a dive. 'Lurch' will never crack a smile and his trusted side kick will get off insulting you because well, you just exist.   Food wise, it's crap on a try with a 50% chance you'll find hair in your food. Literally, for the four times i've been there, there's been hair in my food twice.    But, at 3am this is the McD's alternative....i still can't decide which is worse."}
{"text":"Old-school burger joint that serves up classic renditions of steak on a kaiser and banquet burgers. The onion rings are  crispy and the size of doughnuts and the poutine is tasty. Don't expect friendly service or to be welcomed in, but the classic taste is really highlighted by the 1960's truckstop décor. This place is somewhat of an institution in the community, I think it definitely gives Dairy Freeze a run for their money."}
{"text":"Steer Inn is a greasy-spoon counter service burger joint in Richmond Hill. They've been around for probably 30 years with the newest thing about the restaurant being the cash register. The signage, interior, and atmosphere is 100% original to what it was in the day the place opened. Even the soft-serve iced cream machine looks like it's at least 40 years old. Yes, I'd say it's a dump (ripped/broken seats, salt/pepper shakers made from juice bottles, etc) but for a quick bite I can overlook that.   Their specialty are the burgers which are thin, although quite tasty. The buns they use are light and fluffy and non-toasted. All burgers can be topped with the standard mustard, relish, onion, tomato, lettuce, BBQ sauce, ketchup, and mustard. They also do bacon and cheese for an extra charge. I personally suggest the onion rings which come with a thick, \"fish-and-chips style\" batter and are very tasty. The fries are good as they're fresh cut but nothing special. If you don't like burgers, they serve souvlaki, gyros, and breakfast before 11am. The older couple that own the place are Greek so their souvlaki is authentic!"}
{"text":"Great to support a local independent burger place like this instead of the boring corporate types. This is a institution in the Richmond Hill area. At one time it was like a half-way house on the way North from Toronto in the middle of nowhere on the outskirts of Richmond Hill but the town has grown to surround it. It maintains its Blast from the Past, circa 1980 look and feel however despite its bland up-to-date neighbours.   Given the era and Greek owners, one has a drive to re-live the Belushi SNL skit: \"Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger!\""}
