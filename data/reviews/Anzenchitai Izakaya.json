{"text":"3.5 stars. I've lived in the area my whole life and never knew this place existed! Pretty hidden, dark ambient (standard Izakaya), enjoy the music (mix of pop of English/Korean/Japanese), booth seating, pretty chill, love the vibes here!! 

Have parking lot in the back behind the restaurant and there's an entrance there too. 

Ordered the Beef sashimi (recommend), Beef tartar (recommend), large bowl of udon soup (meh but good filler food), spicy cheese chicken, stack of takoyaki (recommend), octopus (meh), wasabi beans (recommend), bowl of fish balls (pls don't get this), chicken wings (also regretted). Definitely recommend coming here with at least 4 people and ordering a bunch of dishes. They're pretty decent sized, or else you won't be able to try a buncha stuff. Seems pretty fresh and quality materials used, tasty, consistent each time I've been. 

Bring your ID if anyone at your table plans to get alcohol at all!

Can't read the bill since it's Korean... WHAT DID I ORDER?!!"}
{"text":"The waiters and waitresses are slow and don't pay attention to guests; my friend had to walk to the bar to ask for napkins then the bill.  The food isn't anything special: fish was over cooked and rather small; the chicken and cheese was really oily that I asked for a bowl of white rice to absorb it. Not a good place for a good time."}
{"text":"I was first attracted by the name if the restaurant. It shares the same name of a music group in Japan, so I went into the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant looks very unique. It's dark and sets the mood for izakaya drinking. The lamps look like the ancient Japanese style lamp, it is wrapped with the Japanese wo paper. The restaurant sells a variety of sake and they put empty bottles all around a corner. I ordered the following food:

Beef Brisket Yaki Udon (score 4/5)
It tastes good. Though it is the yaki style, i.e. Fried beef brisket udon, there's soya sauce in the base to keep moist the udon noodle and the beef. Overall, the dish is not very dry. In general, I like the dish, just a slightly sweet to my taste.

Chicken skewers (score 4/5)
The skewers came in a decorative fan-like plate. The presentation is impressive when it arrived. The skewers are delicious and the sauce in the side is a bit spicy, which goes well with the Asahi beer I ordered. 

Salted grilled mackerel (score 4/5)
This restaurant really knows how to marinate and cook their food to accompany the taste with the alcoholic drinks . The saltiness of the fish blends well with the cold beer. Can't stop ordering another can of Asahi

Chicken wings (score 4/5)
It is like normal deep fried chicken wings you can order from a bar but just without any sauce. Nevertheless, the wings are good enough for the beer without extra seasoning.

Tips: order a can of Asahi instead of a pint, the price is two dollars less and it has more beer in a can"}
{"text":"had to wait like 10 minutes for a table was so packed full of drunk koreans lol, the food was good giving it 4 stars cause the price's was a bit much."}
{"text":"Went on Friday around 8:30 pm with my wife and upon entry, saw around 4 empty booths.  Hostess said she could not give us a booth and could only sit us at the bar as the booths were for 6 people.  Told hostess we were only planning to stay less than 1 hour but she still said we could only sit at the bar.  Walked out and spent our money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Quite a small and tight place. Seats are all very close to the open kitchen.
Atmosphere - 3/5 
Price -Food and drinks were decently priced for an izakaya
Food -tried okonomoyaki. Came on a bed of shredded cabbages and beansprout. With seafood toppings placed around the pancake. Not enough sauce. Nothing great but till decent. If u like vegi it comes with lots of cabbages.  2.5/5 
Menu - not too many food options available. A single front & back page-full. 
I'm sure they have better dishes. I just didn't get to try many to know.
So so experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, easy parking. Guu looking menu, but bigger portions. My favourite out of all the dishes was the raw beef sashimi. Servers don't always check up on you, so if you need something or the bill, you'll need to step out of booth to flag them."}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed our food/ drinks. There was only two combos available and combo A had mackerel sashimi (delicious!). Definitely coming back! 

*Minus 1 star due to the lack of parking."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday, I'm assuming it's quite new because we were one of the only ones in the restaurant at 8pm. It's a nice atmosphere for drinks, dim and woody. We really liked the: seafood udon noodle, and both of the donburi. The okonomiyaki was good but nothing special. The guys really liked the cheesy chicken as well! Skip the chicken wings they are just fried and not too flavorful. Overall a good place for snacks and drinks, similar vibe to Hashi (or Yuzu) at Yonge n Finch"}
{"text":"I liked the overall environment of this restaurant and the vibes it gave off - there was great music (mixture of top 40 hits, jpop, kpop lol), a casual atmosphere, and friendly servers. However, the food was either mediocre (beef yaki udon) or just plain awful (seared tuna sashimi). The sashimi in particular was pretty much frozen and didn't really taste like anything... Not worth the price for sure! 

I wouldn't be in a hurry to come back to this place, but also wouldn't write it off completely just yet. Perhaps I just need to order differently next time."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night at around 8PM, with quite a large group of 8 people. We were seated quickly in two private booths beside each other. For a Saturday night and large group I was surprised we didn't have to wait at all for a table, perhaps this is a hidden gem.

We ordered the spicy cheese chicken, beef tartare, stir fried udon, spicy udon soup, kimchi stew, frozen tuna sashimi, mackerel sashimi, chicken skewers, fried chicken, fried squid, and  beef tataki.  

I know we basically ordered the whole menu.. and we actually ordered two of the stir fried udon, tuna sashimi, and chicken skewers.

Where do I even begin.. I'll start with things I enjoyed.
The stir fried udon was really good, it tasted kind of sweet. Almost like chinese stir fried beef rice noodles but sweet. 

The spicy cheese chicken even though it told like a million years to come out the bread nacho thing that came with it was gooooooood. However it wasn't like the korean sweet and spicy favour it was just spicy. 

The mackerel sashimi was soooooo good. I usually hate mackerel because of its extremely fishy smell and flavour. However their mackerel was not fishy at all! 

The chicken skewers, fried chicken and fried squid were all okay nothing special just your average izakaya dishes.

Now moving on to things I could not enjoy because they were too damn spicy! LOL I mean I'm not a baby when it comes to spicy food but DAYUM koreans food always seems to be too spicy for me.

The soup udon, although may not look spicy it packs a punch, I could barely eat one noodle it was too spicy. 
The kimchi stew was less spicy than the udon but has a kick.

Lastly the tuna, the tuna was not spicy. But I didn't like the fact it was frozen, kinda looked like watermelon... 

Overall it was really good! Even though we ordered a lot it ended up being 33 dollars per person, which is not tooo too bad however if you're the type to eat a lot and not be full you might not be full by the end of it. I know my boyfriend said he was still hungry after. :/"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden. This may explain why it wasn't busy for a 7:30 pm reservation on a Thursday. The food came quickly - could possibly be because it was empty.

I like the environment - it is very similar to Hashi. The portions are surprisingly quite large. I was expecting tapa size dishes. 

We ordered the following dishes:

Deep fried chicken cartilage - This dish was good but if you're not a garlic fan, do not get this, It is 50% cloves of garlic and 50% chicken cartilage.

Beef brisket yaki udon - This was my least favourite dish - it was nothing special at all. I wouldn't recommend trying this dish. It was a basic stir fry with udon, cabbage and beef. The beef was very tough.

Seared beef sashimi with ponzu sauce - this was good. The beef was fresh.

Cheese & spicy stir fried chicken - if you love cheese, this is definitely the dish for you! This was actually very spicy but tastety. It comes on a sizzling pan and some chips to eat with."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. The Nagasaki jampong is so good! The portion is huge- can share with up to 3 people (I wouldn't want to though). 

The skewers and tataki were not as good, but the jampong seriously made up for this. The atmosphere was really good, parking at the back, good for families and friends.

Definitely recommend trying out!"}
{"text":"It's 1:30 AM and you've just been drinking for 4 hours at a wedding reception and you're looking for something to eat in Markham = How I came to discover Anzenchitai Izakaya

Service:  They are open until 3 AM in the morning every day which is very Vegas/hometown like which I love.  The Japanese servers were assigned to us were both very friendly and gave us a heads up for last call on the food.  The kitchen got our dishes to us quickly and we were very appreciative of that

Food: We were glad to have some high quality dishes so late into the evening.  The beef brisket Yaki Udon was on point as both the noodles and beef were very tasty.  The Rice Cake Skewers get you 4 very big skewers.  The Fried Squid legs was fried well with the right amount of oil.  The deep fried chicken thigh with cabbage and tangy sauce came with a piled with sliced cabbage which complimented the taste.  All dishes came out in portions much bigger than we anticipated which was a pleasant surprise.

Ambiance: Japanese pop music was pumping late at night but not too loud where it would disrupt conversation.  Decorated with lots of Japanese lamps, wall decorations and the booths and tables were mainly composed of very dark wood.  It definitely reminded me of the small Japanese restaurants I came across during my Tokyo visit.

What a great yelp find so late in the night in Markham.  If I lived in the area, I would love to come back and try more of their dishes.  If you're looking for some late night Izakaya dishes in Markham, Anzenchitai Izakaya has you covered."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for a late dinner, a spot tucked away in a dark plaza with a bumpy parking at the back. I thought he was taking me to a underground casino of some sort but turns out it was this neat little place with fabulous food!

The interior has a really good vibe to it with high ceilings. We ordered the beef sashimi, spicy seafood udon, some dish with chicken and cheese and some dish that was \"Japanese style pancake\"? In any case, every dish was delicious! 

It was one of the best izakaya I've had in Toronto, highly recommended."}
{"text":"3.5* knocked up to a 4 due to exceptional service. 

We tried coming here a week ago on a Saturday at 11pm and the place was packed. We waited at the bar with a couple drinks for an hour without a seat, granted they told us they can't guarantee seating unless a table leaves. We wanted to try our luck and stayed but left to eat at another place and decided to try again the next week. 
Moral of the story: call in advance and ask if they have free seating for your party - which is what we did this week. 

The food here is good, but not particularly memorable. They give you a big portion compared to other izakaya/tapas places. Skewers are not available on the menu (crossed out). 
Memorable mentions: spicy chicken cheese; nagasaki noodle soup (huge & broth super tastey); deep fried chicken cartilage; hot sake served in teapot. 

The service, although only had 2 waitresses working, was outstanding. They refilled our water bottle before it was empty, promptly took away empty dishes and offered to refill the free side dishes - which were really delicious. The pickled radish was perfectly salty + spicy (could be too spicy for those who can't eat spice - I can handle very little and it was ok for me)

I would come back for drinks & drinking snacks, not for dinner food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounding down to 3

Cozy Korean place for drinks and snacks.. Place is comparable to the Korean bars are Yonge and finch.. Atmosphere is pretty new, probably 1 or 2 years old.. The menu pricing is about the same as Yonge and Finch, which is a bit expensive considering it's not prime location.

I must say the chicken knees here is one the best I have ever had!!! Better then most Chinese places and I consider this a Chinese drinking dish..

Other things on the menu were pretty standard Korean-Japanese drinking hut items.. nothing really special.. 

Probably would come here if I was looking for a Korean-Japanese bar without any action... pretty quiet and secluded sitting for a bar...  Yonge and Finch area is much much much livelier"}
{"text":"Very hidden Izakaya, very authentic Korean place. Both in terms of food and environment.  Parking is in the back with no lights"}
{"text":"Anzenchitai Izakaya does looks a little sketchy from outside.

I was not even sure it was open when we drove by as all the windows were covered up by heavy shades.

Tapas? Izakaya? My friend probably thought our late dinner would cost a fortune as a lot of small plates needed to make him satisfied.

Spicy Seafood Noodle ($10) was surprisingly good. The heat came from Gochujang Korean Chili Paste. I love the chewiness of the wheat noodle. What impressed us most was the abundant of seafood which was more than noodle! Fresh PEI mussels, Half Blue Crab, Squids, Shrimps! And at $10? (4 star)

Grilled Skewers Chef Choice ($10) was really disappointing. Sadly all the 5 skewers were bad and lack the fresh off the grull taste (1 star). The beef and chicken were the worse as they tasted bland.

Anzenchitai is a decent place for a late night snack. A place to have beers, sake and even some soju. And Spicy Seafood Noodle pleaae!"}
