{"text":"Chicken biryani (mild) - $6:
You can have it mild or spicy. It comes with a boiled egg and one piece roast chicken. The biryani had small pieces of boneless chicken in there as opposed to drumstick/leg or breast piece but the pieces were tender. It also came with a cooked veggie mix (small portion) - tomatoes, onion. It was a good helping and for $6 a definite bargain! My rating: 4/5

Samosa (veggie) - 3 for $1:
The filling is a potato paste with spices, not actual potato chunks and there are no peas. The pastry was crisp and not the thick kind. They are okay but a little on the salty side. Note I'm not a big salt eater so you may find its okay. My rating 2/5.

Message to management:
Please label your food in english and put prices up, this way non-Indian/Sri-Lankan customers can appreciate what is being offered and make a wider selection.

{"text":"Food is dirt cheap and comes in huge portions. However, there is a bit of a language barrier and no menu to look at. The staff do try their best to answer your questions though. 

I come here frequently and can recommend the chicken/mutton kothu roti, the mutton/chicken/eggplant/okra curries + rice combos, chicken biriyani, tandoori chicken, and the samosas and patties. Their singapore noodles are great as well but can be hit or miss depending on the day. Keep in mind, this is a take-out only restaurant (and a small one at that!)."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Sri Lankan place. The biriyani here is really good, and extremely cheap.

Got the mutton biriyani for $7 (including tax). There is a fair amount of meat, and the flavor is great. Warning: it is pretty spicy. It came with a side of pickles, which complimented it well (another review had mentioned a side of eggplant, but I didn't  get that). It also comes with a tandoori leg, which was really tasty and juicy. 

I ordered a mutton roll as well ($1), which was pretty medicore. Also the various other curries they had on display didn't seem very appealing to me (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). 

Takes debit. Fairly big parking lot."}
{"text":"Great place for some Sri Lankan cheap eats. This is my favourite place to get some spring rolls. Theyre so soft compared to other places which is what I love. 

Prices are pretty standard. The service is also relatively quick. During lunch hours, especially on weekends, it does build up. Seems like they have some loyal fans. 

It's a grab and go restaurant. There's no place to be seated which is expected."}
{"text":"Birchmount and finch hosts one of the best biryani's around the Markham area. Amazing portion, flavourful sides (eggplant and pickles) . Biryani already has shredded chicken and also comes with one piece of Tandoori chicken (seasoned amazing) plus a bonus boiled egg.

Its only $6. Portion big enough for two people. I can almost never finish it.

MUST TRY!!!! Great little tamil dive in. Probably one of the best deals in the area. Quality and taste for that price is a steal."}
{"text":"Ouch. Had the lunch special again. That wonderful $4.00 box stuffed full of rice and vegetable dishes? Yeah. That thing. Brown rice. oddly enough, it's not that brown. Almost barley brown, if that's a descriptor (and no, I wasn't trying to spell barely). Today's vegetable options were dal (savory and not very spicy), soy (still a tad too salty for me, but fascinatingly quirky), beets (they just taste like shredded, stewed beets. also slightly too salty for me), potato and tomato stew? (or potato and stewed, slivered hot peppers), cabbage (which still tastes like slightly bitter bok choy with a few large pieces of hot peppers), and what was almost like a cool salad made of shredded carrot and chunks of red onion, cucumber and tomato mixed in slightly watery yogurt-like base. 

Highlights: I quite enjoy that dal. I also find the soy amusing. It reminds me of Chinese deep fried gluten products, but in what almost looks like watery rabbit dropping form (don't let this stop you from trying it). The yogurt and veggie option was a nice save from the burn (more on this later), but because it was sitting atop the hot rice, it wasn't quite as cool as I'd have wished it to be. Perhaps next time, I'll ask for this on the side.

Oddlight: I ate something that was probably top three on my spicy list. It wasn't an in-my-face sort of burn. It was a slow, throat burning sensation, and boy did it burn. Think alcohol throat warming, but considerably more intense. I had a whole small iced cap with chocolate mint shot and three papadums trying to keep the burn at bay. It helped...minutely. I have a feeling it was the potato stew, but I wasn't willing to risk more throat burn to have that confirmed.

Oddlight part 2: They gave me a very small container of what I believe was some kind of broth? If it wasn't broth, someone, please tell me, because I drank it (I didn't know what else to do with it). It was almost a brown/grey beef broth color, but didn't taste of meat. It tasted soup and spicy. Someone help? It was odd, but not in an entirely unpleasant way.

Lovely perk: In one of my previous reviews, I mentioned that there is no menu here. That being said, almost every time I've come, I've pointed at something and asked what it was. This time, I pointed at something that looked similar to a timbit, albeit more deep-fried looking, and less iced (icing iced, not frozen iced). I was told it was sweet. I declined. I'm not particularly fond of sweet, especially if I don't know how sweet. While packing my food, my server decided he was going to give me one of these sweets. Score! It was almost like a Chinese donut (like the ones at congee places), except it has a very small spicy burn after. He told me they were five for a dollar. I caved.

Total damage: $5 for my very stuffed veggie lunch box with rice, a small container of what may or may not have been soup, three papadums (I think they were supposed to give me two, but two of them got stuck together), three small hot peppers (because my lunch was totally not spicy enough...said in the most sarcastic tone I can muster online), and 5 of those lovely, sweet...sweets... 

Side note: Those sweets. I asked what they were called. The answer I received was, \"Sweet. Five for a dollar.\" That's what I'm going to call them next time I want to order them."}
{"text":"I came to Suvaiyakam for lunch and walked out with so much food for $5 that I though there must have been some mistake. 

There was no menu but I asked for whatever vegetarian lunch special they had and I got a big square foam container of rice and four curries, a side of rasam, two small containers of sweets (one was halva I think and the other was tapioca pudding), and a bag full of chips, fried chiles, and papadums. I think three moderately-hungry people could have maybe eaten it all. It all tasted great too!

I found the service to be particularly friendly and helpful, which is nice when it's your first time at a take-out counter with no menu!"}
{"text":"Went there again today to pick up some Sri Lankan food.  The food there is always exceptional.  Busy place; there are always line ups every time we go.  The short eats are soooo good.  My favourite is the fried king fish ... the chicken biryani is very popular as well.  We tried it today - it was less spicy than we expected.  The mutton kothu rotti is very good as well.  This place is solid.  Consistently good quality and never ever disappoints."}
