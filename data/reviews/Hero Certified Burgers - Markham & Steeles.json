{"text":"Really like Hero Burger's burger. Fresh and very tasty. If adding lots of extras can turn out to be a bit of a pricy burger but delicious. First time at this location, and found friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"I frequent the Markville Hero Burger location fairly often and enjoy it thoroughly. I decided to try this location expecting similar quality, but was extremely disappointed. My first time trying this location was a number of months ago on a weekday at around 3 p.m. where there were only 2 customers eating in the restaurant and myself ordering. Yet they still managed to overcook my beef patty in my hero burger, charge me for cheese that I didn't request and miss the tomatoes in my friend's order. Fine. Maybe the chef in that day was inexperienced or having a bad day. I decide to give them another chance and was let down once again. Both my patties were overcooked and chewy again, and this time instead of adding cheese, they forgot to add some of the condiments I requested: hero sauce, ketchup, mayo and onions. To go along with that, there were 4 other customers that ordered after me, but got their burgers before me due to the lack of organization between the staff members. Once my order was hand-delivered to me, I came to the realization my order was sitting on the \"preparation table\" (where they put your burgers on a tray, bag, give you ketchup, etc...) for 5 minutes while I watched them deliver to the customers before me. Again, I'd like to reiterate that I love the Markville location and the product that Hero Certified Burgers put out, but it is safe to say that I will not be visiting this Hero Burger location any time soon."}
{"text":"so yummy 
the vegetarian burger is bomb dot com 

I recommend the ancho chipotle sauce!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service! I would not recommend this burger chain. I think I am going to stick with Five Guys. They made a mistake on my order, I specifically asked for a new burger and the server just removed the ingredients and gave me the same old burger again."}
{"text":"LOVE Hero. My friend thinks 5 guys is better but he is crazy. This place is 1000 times better than 5 guys and the meat is free range too. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"First time trying hero burgers. Decent burgers, we ordered the deluxe chicken & double patty burger. The chicken deluxe was a bit dry. The burgers didn't impress me."}
{"text":"Hero Burgers are decent burgers, not your McDonalds or KFC. They have chicken, fish, veggie and your standard beef burger option. Maybe it's just me, but you can tell it's just a better quality meat! Toppings are neat and creative with jalapeños and etc.The one thing about this I don't like its their skimpy on the onion rings or sides, like come on. 

Upper end fast food, for a pricier meal, but tastes better as well. Light handed on the quantity of the sides."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo and several ala carte items via Skip the Dishes. When the order arrived the poutine and the drink were missing. How can it be a combo if all I have are sandwiches and chicken fingers? Very upsetting as it was the responsibility of the staff here to check if orders are complete before they hand it to the courier. No receipt in the bag as well maybe that's why they forgot to pack several items in there. Never ordering from this restaurant again and if you want complete meals, maybe this shouldn't be the location to order from."}
{"text":"The place is okay. Service is good but the burgers are really ordinary and expensive side. I find hero burgers really overrated. I like there home style fries though."}
{"text":"This is our go to location for hero burger. Whenever we are craving a gourmet burger at decent affordable prices.  

The service has always been exceptional here, ringing the food to your table.  Cute ketchup packets in the shape of a Heinz bottle. 

This location often has specials.  There was one of the window when we walked in today.  4 oz.  Burger with a drink for 5.29! That's a good deal since the burger itself was already 5.19. 

They used to have this promotion when wearing raptors, leafs or marlies gear on game nights. You would get a free combo with the purchase of a burger.  But too bad I don't see that anymore :(

The burgers have your typical toppings but also some unique ones like slawsa (like a coleslaw relish), they used to have a zucchini relish. Many different sauces to choose from. 

The presentation of the burger is always neatly put together.  And tastes juicy and hot. 

Didn't know about the check in offer, but I got their special, so next time for sure I'll take advantage of it. 

Today they gave me a sheet of coupons to use for next time.. Good until May 31."}
{"text":"The burger was customizable from the bun to the sauces picked. Ordered ciabatta bun with 8oz patty, roasted red peppers, cheese,  lettuce, tomato, and maple chipotle sauce. The patty was extremely well made and good quality too (your digestive system can definitely tell the difference) The only thing was that the sauce was too runny like water and barely had flavour. 

Mushroom poutine was excellent and fun to eat because the cheese was extremely stringy. 
A 4oz burger is 5.50 currently which is on special. 

Also check in on yelp for 20% off which i forgot to do xD

Edit:
Came back here for their zucchini fries... I recommend them. They made me feel a tad less guilty in eating fried foods.
Also changed it to a 5-star rating due to the impeccable service. It was unexpected from a fast-food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Standard Hero Burger joint. The best part about this one, is there is plenty of free parking. Otherwise, it's just the same as the other Hero Burgers. Still love it though."}
{"text":"This burger joint never fails to satisfy my burger needs! Love this place and in particular this location is pretty awesome! The staff is quick and friendly. They help with topping selections and more! I get the soul burger combo (veggie burger selection) for those vegetarians! It tastes amazing! Wouldn't go anywhere else for a gourmet-ish burger with decent prices. You can't get as many toppings as you like but premium toppings like grilled pineapple or sautéed mushrooms are extra. You can even add as many sauces as you want in your burger like I did! Great tasting burgers and the sides are good as well! You get fries but you can sub it for sweet potato fries or onion rings. The place it self is clean and spacious. You always have a seat to sit no matter what and it's not too busy ever. Great place"}
{"text":"Well since this is a franchise, you can pretty much expect the quality of food to be consistent across the board. If you haven't had Hero before, I would say it's definitely one of my top three preferred burger joints. I don't go for their fancy stuff - Hero's signature burger with extra mayo and a bit of hot pepper is my staple choice. The burger is so juicy and never burnt. Sometimes I go for the 6 oz or 8 oz just to get a Hero hangover (fat life!)
The people working at this particular location are so sweet and friendly. They brought me my order to my table because they saw I was chatting with my friends and didn't want to interrupt us. 
If you are in the hood, come to this Hero's joint for a quick burger craving."}
{"text":"Got a 6oz Hero Burger with Sweet Potato Fries. I love Hero Burger because it is very fresh and they use healthier and more natural ingredients compared to the majority of burger joints. Service was good."}
{"text":"this was my first experience at a hero burger and i was thoroughly impressed.

for a gourmet burger, i expected to be paying around $20 for a meal. also, because it was empty at the time i went, which was fairly late in the night, there was no line so i was looking at the menu and all the different toppings i could choose from instead of checking in first.

dont forget to check in! you get 20% off!

but yea, lots of options to choose from.
i added an egg, grilled mushrooms and guac to my burger and didn't even notice the free menu items located at the bottom of the menu. so i'd definitely say my burger was half assed an incomplete. but based on what i had in my burger, it was made well. the yolk in the egg was runny, which i personally like. and it made eating my burger messy, and if you know me, everything tastes better when it's messy.

also got mushroom poutine. cheese was really stringy. and i should got a different type of poutine because i already had mushroom in my sandwich. was a bit overkill.

i normally don't talk about service but service here was exceptional. i don't know if it was because it was empty or not, but i was not expecting to have food brought out to me were i was seated, and the trays also collected when server noticed i was done eating. i wish i had got the name of the employee, but he is a type of guy you'd want to work for you. going above and beyond what is asked for."}
{"text":"Brand new location in Scarborough, this is one of the 2 locations that is East of 404. 

Staffs here are enthusiastic and efficient. Even during busy lunch hours, the line moves really fast. The lone cashier even have my burger combo delivered to my seat!

So how's the burger? A OK, but just a little over sauced, and I made a mess eating that.

Definitely will be back if I have the burger craving in the area."}
