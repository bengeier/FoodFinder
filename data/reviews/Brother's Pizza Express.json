{"text":"I didn't love it. The calzone dough was very thin and toppings were in my opinion cheap."}
{"text":"Came here before heading out of town. The pizza was \"ok\" the wings were adequate. We were all hungry so it was a filler. 

Customer service wasn't bad. I just came in and grab my pizza and wings. 

I probably wont come back to this pizza place, but for a convenient pizza join on the way to Cali, it was worth a stop."}
{"text":"Listed prices for a four \"regular\" topping pizza was $13.75 on there website.  But when you call to order it's $19.75.  LIST THE CORRECT PRICES! They also never have spinach, i'm veggietarian so thats a big thumbs down!  Go to Garden Pizza instead!  It's Better pizza/wings anyways and you get the added bonus of having correct prices listed.  Owner was one of the original brothers pizza on indian school. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The other reviewers are on crack. I live about two blocks away from this place and believe me when I say that it is the closest thing to NY \"greasy\" pizza that you will ever get. Yes, I grew up in NY so I speak from experience. This pizza is fantastic. If you don't like NY style pizza then you are some weird ass California hippie!"}
{"text":"Worst service and food ever.  Gave them a 2nd chance and it was worse than the 1st time.  Got a Cesar salad - iceberg lettuce, onions, croutons and Cesar dressing, Never had onions on a Cesar salad. Out of breads for the sandwiches except for the hoagie bread and then you get 1 slice of meat lots of lettuce, then got an appetizer of jalapeno poppers which were still cold in the middle and something pink coming out of it.  The worst part is the person working there was that they didn't believe my husband when he told them that the jalapeno's were still cold, the worker replied are you serious.  They are always under staffed.  The only way you can get a refund of part of the order is on the whole order.   If this was the kind of service we got the first time we wouldn't have returned the second time.  If you want some good pizza go to Bella's Pizza off of the I-17 and Litchfield next to Starbucks, it is facing south in the parking lot.  Have been there twice and they have great food and great service."}
{"text":"It's good pizza but not amazing. All the other reviews say really greasy but it's not as greasy as Taste of Italy's pizza. I tried out a medium pepperoni napolitana. The sauce is good, has that slight tanginess to it. Will come back if in mood for non-chain napolitana style pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice....OMG, absolutely the worse pizza.  The greasiest, most unhealthy slice of pizza ever.  Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza.  They literally took a slice of pizza at room temperature and quickly re-toasted it.  It was so disgusting.  Never again!!!"}
