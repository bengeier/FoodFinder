{"text":"Super delicious. Very flavorful. Spicy clams, ma po tofu, sweet and sour ribs, hot and sour soup were all very delicious"}
{"text":"Too bad I cannot put 0 stars. This place must have reopened...
As a visitor in town, we chose this place because it seemed ro have the simplest menu.
Horrible service and food. Felt like we walked into somewhere we were not welcome or expected. I ordered Mapo Tofu and I was told I would be charged for rice, and if I wanted a small dish of steamed vegetables, I had to order a vegetable entree costing 12$. 
The mapo tofu cause some kind of nasty reaction in my mouth that made the ice water (which we had to ask for mid meal) taste fizzy and tart. I do not know what they did, but I was afraid to eat more. I had  a total of 6 bites and stopped eating. I did not feel my concerns would be understood or taken care of, so I  paid and left."}
{"text":"The people were nice enough but....I'm sorry the food was just plain nasty! I got the lunch special sweet-and-sour pork. Tough as nails! I have never tasted something fried that tasted like it was deep-fried in Old motor oil! That's the only way that I can describe it to you,  it was basically inedible!
Just gross! 
The sauce was incredibly sweet with no sour balance. They do not make an effort here and they definitely do not change the fry oil on a regular basis. That I can tell you for sure! Tough, chewy nasty tasting drowned in over sweet MSG filled sauce. I almost threw up! At least the rice was good and the green tea was good. My advice, stay very far away from this place! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"What a damn restaurant! We've been sitting there for one hour and nobody came to serve us, even we asked several times!"}
{"text":"What a damn restaurant! We've been sitting there for one hour and nobody came to serve us, even we asked several times!"}
{"text":"so bad. worst service ive ever had. wont try this ever! the pork dumpling is not bad though"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very bad, pork ribs inside the pork deterioration, pork smelly. The boss forced a tip, the attitude is very bad, the local health bureau should be reviewed. I and my friends in the future will not come to this restaurant to eat, very unpleasant a experience."}
{"text":"I have no idea how their still in business???
I love chinese food been to sooo many different restaurants this has been the worst. First of all the place smells so bad. Place was empty. NO type of decorations the old lady that sat us down and took our order was soooooo rude. Like cmon why the attitude and long face you've been doing nothing all day because the restaurant is dead. I had to get up walk to her to order our drinks because she only took our entrees order. I had to get a High chair myself because she obviously forgot (i dont get how) when we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant. I had to tell her if they had Soy sauce/ chili... Nasty food the chow mein was so hard it needed more cooking, sesame chicken was alright and beef brocoli was disgusting tasted sour like it had orange/lime juice wth mann. &&& the plate are sooooooo expensive for a smalll tiny portion. I think we couldve ate at PF changs (small portions) but delicious food. She also charge us 15% for service wtf smh. Well obviously right because with the terrible terrible service nobody leaving her a damn tip so she has to charge it on the receipt. You got us good there lol. We couldve ate dollor menus from mcdonalds and been wayy better then this crap. DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Dishes was too small but cost was high. We spent $100 for three small portion of dish. DO NOT PAY TIPS cause the 15% tips will added to your bill automatically."}
{"text":"Went in for the noodle poster on their wall, but the real noodle was sooo bad that made me lose my apperti! The noodle soup smells turning bad already. Also, they charged 15% tips automatically for such bad serves-- we waiting at front door about 5 mins to get the first waiter came to talk to us; they serve the dishes without rice so we ask for rice(charged) THREE TIMES until we finally got it. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The pricing is high, quality of food is subpar if not very low. Dining area is dirty. The worker who does cleaning does not wear enough sanitizing protection, nor has sanitizing product to aid the cleaning. The waiter tried to bait the costumer into ordering high margin dishes without clear menu markup, such like \"live fish\" priced at \"seasonal price\". Restaurant demands cash only for payment, which is a disgusting practice to avoid taxation. Restaurant forced a 15% gratuity additional charge without customer consent or previous acknowledgement. All in all it is a bad business who lurks in a tourist area, charge high against visitors who usually cannot communicate well and can only chose to be resilient; the restaurant does not care about conventional restaurant practice. Sorry for them, we are Americans and we must protest. My child feels uncomfortable after the dinner. This is absurd."}
{"text":"Overpriced nastiness, and when I say overpriced, I mean overpriced, $15.00  for a small bowl of cabbage. I'm positive they gouged the hell out of my group but then again it's Vegas. 4 people for $270.00 and we had to stop at in -n- out on the way back to the hotel. Dont waste your time or your money. They need 1/4 stats for this place.."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day we visited. The food, particularly the noodles was not authentic to me, some dishes from another take-out place. Cold appetizer dishes are excellent. Service is great."}
{"text":"do not come here! Taste is bad, service is bad and slow. And we were forced to give tip. Do not bother to come!"}
{"text":"Living in Texas, I have yet to find a decent xiao long bao place that meets my standard, so I decided to hunt for it during my Vegas trip. Despite reading the low reviews mostly for bad service, my family and I decided to give this place a try. It was Spicy City's darn tempting poster that caught me! 

The \"highlight\" of the experience was that absolutely NO ONE spoke English. I called ahead and the lady could not answer a simple yes/no question. She told me that her English wasn't very good, then we awkwardly hung up the phone. When we arrived, our waiter also didn't speak English. The waiter kept speaking Mandarin to me. I could understand bits and pieces of what he said and made effort to order a rack with the little Chinese Mandarin I knew. The waiter scoffed at me and scold me in broken English for not knowing Chinese when I'm \"Chinese\" and I kept telling him \"I'm NOT Chinese\" both in Mandarin and English. My brother joked, \"if no one speaks English, then who did the paperwork??\" To top it off, he's screaming \"Amigo! Amigo!\" to his worker while madly waving his arms and throwing crazy sign language at him. 

Aside from that, the pork xiao long bao served its purpose! It was juicy and the broth was tasty. Not the best I had compared to Joe's Shanghai in NY, but it satisfied my craving. It beats most  so called \"xiao long bao\" from other restaurants where the broth has been absorbed into the dumpling and there's no drop of soup coming out. This place gets an EXTRA star for decent xiao long bao!

In conclusion, I now understand why Spicy City deserved its low ratings for service. I found the experience to be more HILARIOUS and MEMORABLE than anything. It makes an entertaining story I can tell over and over to my Chinese friends. Although I only had xiao long bao, the food here seemed authentic as I see mostly Chinese families and Chinese tour buses eating here. I highly recommend coming in with someone who speaks Mandarin or at least having a Mandarin speaking friend on FACETIME to order for you. Hopefully, you won't get scolded for not speaking Chinese or even meeting halfway and trying your damnest to communicate!! But Jayzzuss!! Please take the wheel!!"}
{"text":"That doesn't meet my basic expectation. We came here for dinner and ordered some noodles. One of them has stinky tofu and they didn't tell us. They should let their customer know that one of their noodles has stinky tofu, not everyone can accept that smell. Service was alright, don't expect too much. Food wasn't good."}
{"text":"This is the place to avoid. Beware of what they claim market price live fish, my recommendation is that if you have to order live fish, let them show you it is alive before cooking. I wouldn't trust what they say. In the end, they included the tip in our bill. If you visit this place, you might want to pay attention to this if you don't want double tip them."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad  ordered a blow of  noodles ?the meat and shrimp are not fresh .... extremely disgusting
Totally wasted time and money. Do not  come ahhhhhhh"}
{"text":"1.  All the food taste salty 
2.  Service was bad, restaurant is dirty
3.  When there is no service and we only have 5 people, they included 15% service charge on our bill, I told him what is the service charge for? and I am not paying the 15% SC for no service....they just look at me and play dumb....
4.  Don't waste your money here, go to HK Star down the street, they have great lunch special and service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I am really suprised by the mediocre overall reviews for this restaurant.  I have been to Spicy city about 6 or 7 times, and it has been consistently great.  The only explanation for the mediocre ratings perhaps could be that people are not ordering spicy food at a restaurant named \"Spicy City.\"  Whenever I go, I order spicy food that makes me sweat, and clears my sinuses.  Yes it is hot, but it is GOOD.  Indeed EVERY spicy dish I have ordered at this place has been at least good, and often is great.  
Indeed I would say that this restaurant has become my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas when both cost and flavor are taken into consideration.  Don't go here if you don't like spicy food.  Don't go here for a romantic dinner for two.  This restaurant is like other authentic Chinese restaurants in being very utilitarian and non-fancy.  Go here if you like really spicy Chinese food that is delicious."}
{"text":"Beware of this restaurant using nasty practice to rip you off. They would suggest something highly priced and intentionally count wrong items to charge you twice. 

This restaurant has been moved to the second floor of the Ranch 99 mall.

???????????????"}
{"text":"Food (over priced) and service were both terrible. I stayed there for an hour, seeing more than 6 groups of customers left, the waitress said \"if you don't want to wait , just go! we don't serve fast food!\" Actually their food tastes worse than fast food. Food one star, service zero star."}
{"text":"The food was rather bland.
The service was not that great.
The restroom was dirty: it was trashed and had toilet paper all over the place.

The \"bill\" was a piece of scratch paper with a price on it. The taxes and 15% tips were already included; however, there was no handwriting, print, or any form of indication that tips and taxes were already included. My friends and I had to figure it out for ourselves.We added the cost of our plates of food, and then we questioned the waiter and the cashier about the \"bill\". Only AFTER we asked them about the bill, did they first told us that tax was included. The \"bill\" was still a lot higher than the price including tax. So I asked them again, and the waiter said finally admitted that the tips were also included. 

Also, the tips were decided by the restaurant. THEY decide how much you should pay them for their poor services. I thought that the customers are the ones who are supposed to be the ones to decide how much to tip, not the restaurant. Guess this is something new to me. 

One advice I have for the owners is to at least write on the bill somewhere that taxes and tips are already included before handing the bill out. There was NOTHING else on the bill besides numbers. Nothing stating how much we have to pay before or after taxes, or tips."}
{"text":"Rude services. These people treat you as if you are stealing from them. Forget about smiles, they sometime even pretend they don't hear what you say and force you to repeat! To be fair, the food seems okay. But you would definitely lose your happy mood after eating there."}
{"text":"If there's is a negative star I will definitely pick that one. The waiter ( the boss) talks so loud and has been so rude to some customers. Food portion is small but pricey. Won't come again and not recommend this restaurant.."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and decent Chinese Cuisine.

Come dine here for the food, not the service or ambience.  The walls are fairly bare, and besides a TV playing Chinese Television and movies, there isn't a lot going on aesthetically speaking.

We ordered:

Spring Rolls - Lightly crisp, packed with shredded cabbage and a nice garlic flavor.  I prefer an Americanized Egg roll with meat inside, but this wasn't too bad.  Definitely not too greasy, which is key in spring rolls.

General Tso's Chicken - Nice and sweet, this guilty pleasure item really hit the spot.  The crisp breading wasn't too heavy or greasy, and the sauce, while quite viscous, wasn't overly heavy.  

1/2 Smoked Duck - A light smokey flavor comparable to a smoked ham.  The skin was nice and crispy, and the breast meat was especially delicious.  Since duck is fattier than many other Poultry, I was alright with the pieces that had a little fat on them.  Luckily if you are not, the skin (fat) seperates without struggle, and you can just enjoy the tender meat.

Dan Dan Noodles - Rice noodles topped with crushed peanuts, Chili flakes, ground pork, and chili oil.  Nice and spicy, these noodles carried a bit of the chili oil which made them messy and greasy, but I still enjoyed them.  The flavor was quite nice, resting on the heat from the chili flakes and the salt from the peanuts.  


I wouldn't rush back here since there are so many other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity, but overall a pretty good meal, especially for the price.   All this food plus two Budweisers ended up costing about $50."}
{"text":"As with most of the other reviewers, I also failed to check the reviews before visiting this place. My family stopped by during our Christmas trip to Vegas. It was super freezing outside and we didn't feel like spending forever deciding in the cold so we chose this place.  

The food was decent, authentic Chinese food, but that was the only good thing about this place. The waiters were extremely rude, curt, and absent. They only provided us with one serving spoon for four dishes, and when we asked for a couple more, they gave us three soup spoons. The restaurant wasn't even 10% full. I doubt they ran out of serving spoons... The portions were small and it was expensive given portion size. The tables were dirty and in bad shape, which usually doesn't deter me if the food is good... And the worse part was the tea! It was tepid slightly brown tap water at best! D: What decent Chinese place doesn't have good tea?! Or at least hot tea that's not cold.

Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"It's actually open, but doesn't matter..it's like the restaurant is closed. Don't go here. I would give it zero stars if I could. 

Our family helped them clear the table for us and then sat there for 20 minutes without any service. The restaurant wasn't even full and many people were just sitting there waiting for food.

We just left and went to another restaurant nearby and was immediately served."}
{"text":"Aggressive waiter with bad attitude who is actually owner of the restaurant. Overpriced dishes with very few food. We have three people ordered 3 dishes and 1 dim-sum, they charged me 79 almost 80 dollars. And we were not full at all.  Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about my spicy Asian food and this place delivered. I had the spicy tofu and spicy fish and it was amazing. I loved the food! I want more! I will be headed back to work my way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. I'm writing this review because: it's not every day that you have your worst restaurant experience ever. Mine happened in this restaurant, Chinatown, Las Vegas. 
1. Dirty - I meant really nasty
2. No service at all
3. Foods are not good and expensive. 
DO NOT go to this restaurant!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I should really read those reviews before come. 
The food was not nice at all- I ordered a MaoXueWang and it was 80% full of spring sprout?
The price was high!- Is it they don't know how much other similar restaurants' similar food?!
The service was fucking rude!!!!--we were not that hungry so we only ordered one dish and he said\" only one?! Whatever. It's up to you.\" And then left. When we checked, they asked us to pay cash but we wanted to use card. But since they asked, we putted all of our cash on the table. They counted and it was only enough for paying food, no more for tips. Before we said nothing,they said\"you have to pay tips!\" We said:\"so use the card.\" and then they received our card reluctantly. 

We are visitor in Vegas and this restaurant had ruined our beautiful night totally. We highly don't recommend you guys go there. This kind of restaurant doesn't deserve to get people's business. 

If you don't know how to do your business, you will shut down one day, sooner or later."}
{"text":"Rude service, aggressive waiter (the owner) who pretty much picked our every order(unnecessary orders) for us to rip us off

Recommendation: go find somewhere else to eat. (-.-) this place."}
{"text":"Rude services. Nasty food. High price. 

I had bad diarrhea and my friend felt nausea after eat there. 

Not recommended and won't go back."}
{"text":"the worst restaurant in Las Vegas. how does this place stay open?  upon walking in.. there were only two tables that had people sitting there.  both tables were not Chinese people.. they were Mexican.. which tells you this place is not authentic. then.. you sit down at a table.. which are like made out of cardboard by the way. the waiter is unkind and only said the word \"ok\" to us after we ordered. he didn't say hello or anything. the tea we got was room temperature and watered down. the food is flavorless. I've never had to put so much salt in my food before as I did tonight. we ordered yunnan rice noodle soup$7.99 and beef noodles$8.99. totally unauthentic. the portions are not small.. they're down right STINGY. a lot of water and a little bit of flavor. all the pieces of chicken I received was only bone. the ham tastes as if it has been sitting in the freezer for ever. don't think that putting chili oil in your food will make it taste better, because their chili oil sucks too. is this place really named \"spicy city\"? also finally.. even though there were only three tables that were occupied now at this point, the waiter didn't bother checking up on us or even giving us the check. service sucks but i would have been okay with that if the food didn't suck. but it did. EVERYTHING SUCKS."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese place I've ever been to! They have food that I haven't seen at other Chinese places so that's a plus. Just the right amount spice to light up my world :)

My friends and I went there this year around New Years. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Spicy City has taken over the New Shanghai.  We went today for lunch and we all thought it was pretty good.  The dining room has been repainted but still has big cardboard boxes in the corner LOL.  The kitchen looked clean.

We ordered the lamb with cumin which hubby and I enjoyed but teen boy's said it had to much cumin. (the waitress told us that white people do not like this dish ha ha)  We had a combination spicy hot pot with chicken and beef which was very hot and delicious. We had twice cooked pork and fish fillet with garlic sauce, both were very good.

The place was not very busy so I hope people give it a try!  They have American Chinese as well so something for every body."}
{"text":"Dishes actually taste pretty good. But the portions are just too small. I would expect similarly small portions at much more upscale restaurants, but definitely not at this restaurant with such environment. Given the good restaurant choices in Vegas (including in Chinatown), this will be the last time I come to this restaurant."}

{"text":"Glad I wasn't the only one who feels this way? Had the most unpleasant conversation with the owner of the restaurant because I rejected the idea of getting his \"live fish\" market price dish.  What a bad representation of legit Sichuan cuisine!"}
{"text":"It's not closed, but it might well as be.  No one goes to this place, so you will find it empty. We made that mistake! Be warned! Do not go here! Lousy food, lousy service and a big check to top it off. THE WORST CHINESE RESTAURANT IN VEGAS SO FAR! Be warned!"}
{"text":"This restaurant's food is way below average. Too salty. The ingredients are not fresh at all. For example, we ordered the spicy wonton soup. There is barely any meat or vegetables in the wonton and the soup - only wonton skin squeezed together and the wontons are half raw!"}
{"text":"Cash only.

Food: nothing special. Some of the dishes we ordered were questionable. Hot & sour noodle soup wasn't either hot or sour. It was just flavorless. Meat in fried rice smelled funny.

Two stars for the guy who served our table. He was nice."}
{"text":"I like to check out the places that I haven't been told, \"the best place for. ... is. ..\" Usually that means one lemming told another lemming etc etc etc... Or some hipster who just moved to town has decided it's the bomb (#LeThai). Spicy City doesn't have any sort of hipster / foodie cred. Just good really well priced food. If you like flavor as opposed to atmosphere (there is none) try this place. 

I stumbled upon it when I had Satan's personal bronchitis that he must have felt I deserved (seriously, you sleep with a priest once....). I had two spicy soups and cleared right up (take that BeeyellZoBob!). The sautéed smoked pork is sublime. And only $5.99 at lunch. 

I'd take a Sunday afternoon first date here. You can chat or watch Chinese soap operas on the big screen TV. Then take a stroll around Chinatown Plaza (stop at a bakery! Cream puffs!) they'll never know you spent less than $25 on the whole date (you listening #EHarmony player players?)"}
{"text":"The food was horrible and big rip off . We ordered a lobster, there is no one piece of meat and they charged us $70 for it. If I could I would give them -10, don't ever go there. ????????????"}
{"text":"The flavor was alright, but for the prices (understand that rent here is high) I would've expected more. We had the tofu with veggies, which was good, and the ma po tofu, which was alright. The thing that really lacked for me was the clear noodle soup. Usually even if noodle soup isn't spicy, the broth is full of flavor if it's done right. My noodle soup tasted like nothing, like it was just water.

The service was pretty good."}
{"text":"?? ???? don't ever go this place, its unscrupulous restaurant, the price are huge difference after check out"}
{"text":"We tried out the lunch specials and found them to be pretty good.  For about $6 we both got healthy portions of spicy food along with fairly good service.  Take a chance and go for the hotter dishes.  :-)"}
{"text":"We came here as a large group (three families) last Christmas when visiting Las Vegas. We got a water boiled fish, a water boiled beef, chow mein, fried rice, spicy shrimp, spicy chicken, pork noodle soup, etc. At the beginning, they had appetizers like pickled cucumber. The dishes were pretty good, fairly standard for a Szechuanese restaurant."}
{"text":"If your looking for some traditional Chinese, specializing in Yunnan style (not Sichaun) then this is the place!  Must get the Peking Meat Noodles, steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao), the stir fried pig chitlins in spicy sauce.  I would definitely go back again.  It's not the nicest place to eat in terms of decor, but I didn't mind, the food was outstanding.  No wonder they opened a place in Taiwan, so if I go back any time soon, I'll be sure to find this place there!"}
{"text":"I went here on a lazy Saturday afternoon after being lured in by there lunch specials.
Tons of options.
I had the Garlic Shrimp, I greatly enjoyed the flavor of the sauce and the portion was more than fair for the 5.99
BF had the Sweet and Sour Pork. The tang was something I didn't expect but quite enjoyed when I tasted it! The pork was tender.
They have 3 dollar Buds woo hoo. 
All in all a winner."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy Szechwan Restaurant. Twice cooked pork, as far as I know, is the most famous dish in Szechwan and is same from the one I had in Szechwan. Love their mapo tofu. Their spicy chicken wing is super tasty a must order dish."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Five of us went for a late lunch. Able to order off the lunch specials menu even though it was after 3 p.m. Good start. No diners in the restaurant when we got there. Waitress was brusque but I find that typical in these kinds of restaurants. Plates included an entree served with rice and shredded cabbage. Underwhelming entrees. The spicy pork with vermicelli was mushy and not spicy. We had to add spice to everything. Asked if they served cold ginger chicken but there a language barrier. Plates are cheap, portions decent, food so so. Liked the hot tea."}
{"text":"Decent food if you want a quick fix, fast service. Significant language barrier and it was difficult to order and get description of the food."}
{"text":"To be honest, I feel it's good. I have no idea why this restaurant got a low rating. 8 of us ordered almost 10 courses, including traditional Sichuan dishes. Two of my friends' parents own restaurants. They don't feel bad as well. Personally recommended fishes, chickens and dumplings."}
{"text":"My family is from New York City and we were DYING for some rice. (We asians love our rice) We were driving around Chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the Chinatown Plaza caught our eye, so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurants. 
Nothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw Spicy City. It was pretty empty inside, only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant, a very friendly and jolly man, popped his head out and says \"please! come try out the food! it's amazing, my wife cooks it!\" 

This man did not lie. We had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup. Everything was delicious, and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family. However, the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isn't very good at eating spicy foods, tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this restaurants lives up to its name. 

I recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night!"}
{"text":"Worse restaurant I have ever been to. I'll give it that the combo fried rice was okay but when we got our half roasted duck and it was incredibly over cooked. IT WAS BLACK. I am not joking as I state that. I have never had badly cooked duck before.
The service was definitely negative stars, the waitress paid more attention to the damn television. We also never got our water. We don't even get that?! Really?! Over priced for what they serve. Even if it was half the price I would still never ever try their food again. The table cover was also filthy. They can't even change their table covers? Nothing amazing or good about this place. Everyone else that has reviewed this restaurant to be exceedingly horrible are not exaggerating. IT'S TRUE. You might as well save your money and head to McDonalds or something. Uncaring employees, especially with their food. I can't believe this business is even open. 
DON'T GO HERE."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food. Great vegetables and dumplings. Don't forget to try the fish puffs.  Friendly waiter and not expensive."}
{"text":"Customer service suck!!! Been seating for over 25 minutes. They didn't bother to give me hot tea or water. I got all my food, the serving was very little and the price is averaging $12-$16 per order. I was eating still hasn't give me MY water!!!! I had to asked them! My water run out, they just starring at my glass with ice. \"I guess they're waiting till my ice melted down\" ~__~ really unprofessional business. Overall to be honest I will not come back here. I check two restaurant next door and they were really busy and packed of customer then I just decided to go to empty one, but I didn't know the place was empty because they suck. ~__~ wasted about $46.00 meal. Ohh well I learn my lesson."}
{"text":"Oh how I regret not looking at the yelp reviews for this place before I stepped inside this place!

My wife wanted to eat a specific noodle dish that was spicy, the next door restaurant told us this restaurant served it.  It was around 8PM on Tuesday and there were no other customers besides us.  After we got seated and given menus, I was a bit surprised at the condition of the tables.  Granted I don't care if the furniture is worn as long as great food is served but the menu was also sticky.  

We ordered a spicy noodle dish and spicy shredded potatoes.  The shredded potatoes were more expensive than Dong Ting Chun and when it was finally served the portion was considerably smaller.  The peppers they used in this dish was the standard dried red peppers which are not spicy to me although the flavor of the dish was decent.

The bowl of noodles was also much smaller and my wife who has a small appetite was able to finish it despite not even being hungry.  Absolute ripoff in portion.

White rice was also not given, I had to ask for rice.  I didn't know they would charge me for this rice.  

After the meal, my wife had very painful diarrhea once we got back to the hotel.  A truly terrible restaurant.

I implore any prospective patrons to read all the other reviews as they are spot on!

The only thing I found to be positive about this place was the big TV playing Chinese TV shows, but who goes to a restaurant just to watch TV."}
{"text":"I am deeply upset that me and my very hungry and desperate friend decided to walk into this place. It was honestly the worst restaurant I have ever been to. We ordered two appetizers and instead of our server telling us they were out of both, she brought us something else. We assumed it was complimentary .. our entrees come out and we ask for our appetizers, she says that what was given to us was it. We ask not to be charged for it. She claims she doesn't know English and that she will charge us... so we give up. Our entrees are not edible.. they smell like actual shit. We are the only table being sat and we wait to get our checks without eating our food. We seriously considered to dine and dash. Don't come here !! And I hope this place closes !"}
{"text":"Super dirty, the worst service, almost service stuffs could not smell, the food is too less, and expensive, not worth. Ice water was dirty and have no courage to drink, my husband drunk the water and he did not feel good after this lunch. Not accept card, cash only. I want to leave MINUS five star if allowed! NEVER COME!!!"}
{"text":"Spicy City added a 15% gratuity automatically even we only have 3 people. The service and food are not worthy enough to force us paying the tip without asking beforehand. If you don't check your bill carefully, you may pay tips twice."}
{"text":"really bad and disappointed experience at Vegas. The time we were exploring the manu. The owner told us any guest in the restaurant without ordering their spicy chicken should be our the restaurant. At their door advertisement, it writes the shanghai little buns are special offers in order to thanks guests support in the past 8 years. We ordered the second plate of that buns, the owner told us only the first is served with the special offer. The food their is small portion but expensive. The 15% service fee is added automaticly when we wanna check out. How can this service deserve that much service fees. DO NOT GO THERE ANYMORE. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here for almost a decade. Most authentic Chinese food in the city. Our favorites include the dry spicy chicken wings, baby bok choy and black mushroom, and the pork with plum sauce. Please, don't let other people's ignorance of the Chinese culture and true Chinese cuisine detour you from trying this place. Finish it up with a reflexology foot massage at one of the nearby spas and call it a perfect end to your day."}

The fat guy that may or may not be in charge offered a menu, but didn't being the lunch special menu. Ordered brought out dish without rice. How can you eat sichuan cuisine without rice? Food is lukewarm upon arrival (dry pot lamb), lamb and bean sprouts are both lukewarm. Flavor is adequate but underwhelming. Xiao long bao looked like they were steamed 3 times, protein particle hanging out with no juice incide. 25$ min cc charge before before i leave. 

Seriously worst meal in years. Xaio long bao is only after u spend 15$, for 2.99$, I guess if you can tolerate it."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I ever went to. Worst ever!!! Rude and aggressive owner, make you have to go in there and eat. Bad service, order a beer but never bring you one. A fish dish costs $39 dollars, OMG what kind of fish is it? When we were checking bill, they already put the tip on the bill, and you will have to pay for the tip. OMG desperate about money!!! Finally!!! And the most important part!!!! The food gave us run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our belly hurts much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of service is very poor, bad attitude, the amount of food is very small, even the normal amount of lunch is not, the price of dinner we can see the small picture plate, five dishes received 76 dollars."}

{"text":"NEVER COME TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE!! BAD FOOD, TERRIBLE SERVICE! RUDE PEOPLE!! ???

I had the worst experience ever in this place. I went to Vegas for the holiday trip with my family. We stopped by the china town and found this place serve noodles, so we went in. Man, I should have checked the yelp review before I went!!! This place is terrible. Their food doesn't taste good at all, yet they are VERY EXPENSIVE!! Well, this is not the worst part yet.  When we had the lunch there yesterday, it was not full at all during the peak lunch time, yet they were very slow to deliver the dishes.  We complained to them that they were too slow, we were almost done with our noodles but they hadn't delivered the other fried vegetables yet. You know what, I just complained about they were too slow, the lady (probably the owner) was very rude to me saying that they were busy, shouted at me that we should just wait for them!! 

Of course I was very unhappy for that. They didn't feel sorry about that at all but being rude to me. When the bill came, they just forced to charge me 15% for the tips.  Well, I was never poor at giving tips. But their service was so bad that I didn't want to pay for that much tip, especially \"forced\" to pay that much. So I asked whether I could pay less.  Their owner came to ask me why, I explained how I felt I was treated rudely. They didn't say sorry again, but shouted and threatened us with punching the menu on the table ... 

what can I say with this place .. I won't go there again anytime I visit Vegas again, and please avoid this place if you can ..."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times. 
Service consistently rude and absent. 
Last time I walked in, I walked right out. 
It was like I walked into a Triad meeting, no music, just the quiet whirring of the overhead fan... More like a crime hideout in a warehouse than a restaurant. 
Very dirty."}
{"text":"Very good food. Authentic. Spicy as indicated by name. We went there for dinner twice during our short visit to Vegas and we were happy both times."}
{"text":"I was searching for a different place to try and was wondering the Chinese mall and ran across Spicy City. The restaurant seemed to be one of the busiest places so I entered cautiously. All the tables were taken so I was seated at a table that seats 10 and later a couple and another male joined me. They all spoke Mandarin, no English like most or all of the patrons here. The one guy was just slurping away at his bowl of noodles and was in the zone.

I ordered the #1 special noodle soup with rice noodles, shrimp and chicken which was not spicy but very flavorful and I totally enjoyed. To compliment the soup I ordered Mongolian lamb and asked the waiter to not to spicy. The combination of peppers, lamb, green and white onions was delicious and I was hooked on that dish. 

If your looking for a place with nice decor don't bother coming here. The service was decent, it seemed like two waiters were covering the whole place but they were dam efficient. 

Spicy City accepts credit cards and they do add a 15% gratuity automatically which I didn't mine BC the service and food were good."}
{"text":"Last second decision to stop at this place. Service was very poor but the food made up for it. Good place for food if service doesn't bother you."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for over a decade.  The food is authentic Chinese cuisine... not \"Americanized Chinese food.   I spent many years overseas.. and every time this place reminds me of the real Asia I grew to love.   I have read the other posts... do not believe everything you read from people who have never experienced real Chinese cooking.    The place is not an upscale urbanite hangout.. it is a family owned small restaurant.  My suggestion for you is to try something you have not had before.   The dry sautéed chicken wings, baby bok choy with black mushroom, smoked pork with leek,  and many other authentic dishes.   Experience the food.... and don't worry about the atmosphere.    Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We were hoping we have an alternative to Yunnan Garden which is excellent as we also like this style of Chinese food. We sampled three of our favorite dishes from Yunnan Garden over here at Spicy CIty to make a direct comparison:

1) Tofu appetizer from the show case.
2) Pork stew noodles
3) Rice cake with pork.

What a disappointment! The Tofu doesn't have any depth of flavor. The rice cake was bland and only sprinkled with a few small pieces of pork. The Pork stew noodles didn't have much pork and the soup was MSG based (Yunnan's isn't). Price is more here probably due to the rent on Spring Mtn. Yunnan is in the low rent portion of \"Chinatown\" but they prove that with good food, people will flock to it even if you are hidden away.

Service from the single waiter wasn't too bad but the owners don't seem too friendly. High minimum for credit card usage ($25).

The hallway light to the restrooms were turned off the entire time we were there (evening). Lighting color specturm is more suited for a factory floor than a restaurant.

We wouldn't go back again!

EDIT-We recently went to a \"Spicy City\" in San Diego (5/7/11) that is part of a chain of  Spicy Cities in SoCal. According to the lady, the chain is the originator and there are many clones out there including the one in Vegas. The Spicy City in San Diego tasted better."}
{"text":"This place is good after a hangover! Man did the hot soup hit the spot!
I always get the same things here: friend dumplings, dumplings in soup, beef in special garlic sauce, and now my new fav dish, baby bok choy with mushrooms.

They are never busy if you come in the morning/afternoon. But don't be weary because it's empty; they food is satisfying."}
{"text":"We ordered sauteed wings with pepper, barely any chicken in the portion, its all pepper, chickens was too dry.
Mongolian beef was allright. The sauteed bok choy was good. 

My tip for the owner of the restaurant:
Train your employee (waiter) to never say anything BAD in the menu. That time we tried to order something, the waiter just snaped off and said: \"No, don't, its BAD\".
 
I may understand the waiter/manager just tried to suggest something better for us and I appreciated it. However it could be a turn off for the customer, esp the customers who are new in town and unfamiliar with your restaurant. 

The waiter could use a lil' bit more formality when taking orders and serving the food.

If one guest on a full table were aksing for a water, that could be a clue for you to offer some drinks to other guests on the same table as well.

Went there for the experience."}
{"text":"Please don't go there If you are looking for their house noodle soups.  I didn't try their dishes, I ordered two bowls of soups and a dumplings,  they were all bad. 

When the food arrive,  me and my wife were disgusted by the appearance, left over dry beef, old vegetables,  and a broth that taste like MSG with salt. Please see our photos.  We are not picky people But this is beyond edible.  See the photos.  I told my wife not to touch It because we are on vacation,  and I don't want this to ruin our trip. 

I left $26 on the table and heading to the door.  Then called a friend of mine to recommend something else on the stripe.  

Just dont waste your time here."}
{"text":"Foods are authentic!  Most of the foods are spicy yet delicious, and the non-spicy Yun Nan rice noodle soup is the best for real!  In a flavorful clear broth, the rice noodles are cooked al-dente and makes good comfort food!  Always packed but the high turnover rate helps get everyone seated quickly.  The only bad thing here is that credit cards are not acceptable, meaning Bring Cash!"}
{"text":"Don't come to this place without reading the reviews! Sincerely! 
I have never been such a restaurant with this bad service! The owner is so aggressive and he made you to order the dishes you don't want. The food is not bad but it makes feel bad because they made you to order and pay. You will have to pay dishes you never orders at the end with 18% tips included. 
How come they are still open after so many 1 star reviews?"}
{"text":"I ordered a fresh fish soup that didn't show price. Just show seasonal price.  I think that is less than 1LB. Very small a dishes, a little bit tofu. It's 40 dollars.  And then. The other importance. We got the bill. They charged our four people tips. If here can give zero star I prefer    give this bad restaurant."}
{"text":"Not impressed. With a thumbs up from restaurant reviewer John Curtis, we gave this place a try. I see the Yelp reviews are all over the place for Spicy City, and clearly has been invaded by some disgusting trolls with only one review under their belt and no friends skewing the stars in an unfavorable way for Spicy City....most of those are filtered now thankfully, a couple still remain IMO.  

That said, everything we had was not that good at all. Some chicken dish that I forgot the name of, boiled Sechezuan beef that had plenty of fire from red pepper flakes but I detected NO Schezwan pepper at all. Also ordered some tiny, sausage filled, unimpressive, dim sum appetizer. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, but everything WE had was not that good at all. I hate giving bad reviews but this place is didn't cut it for us at all.

Waiter and service was fine, and the place didn't look filthy like other reviews have claimed-it certainly wasn't spotless either."}
{"text":"totally shit, shit service. The waiter told us to move the dishes ourselves when we needed to move to another table. I never write a review before but this restaurant is terrible"}
{"text":"They are one of my favorite chinese restaurant. The owners are extremely friendly, i usually phone in to pre order the live lobster, it is the best dish i ever have in vegas! I dont know why there are so many bad reviews here, their other spicy dishes are just as good as yunnan garden."}
{"text":"Got the vegetable and ham rice which was the best thing we ordered.  The beef noodle soup was just ok and all 3 cold items (spicy beef, pork intestine and soy bean/vegetable) were also.  Disappointed since I'm a big fan of spicy Chinese food (Yunnan, Sichuan, Human) but this place just fell short.  Won't be going back since I liked the old restaurant at this location more."}
{"text":"The only reason we came here is because Pho Kim Long had to line up over an hour.
We ordered Yunnan noodles and the taste was horrible. The meat was not fresh at all. I suspected that the mean went bad...
Stay away from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Spicy City is nothing spectacular, but it was edible. It is a step above fast food quality, but there are many other places that offer better dishes, bigger portion, and cheaper prices especially during lunch time. The lunch specials lack in all of the above. 

I had ordered the eggplant in garlic sauce and it was ok. I don't have anything more to say about it. The deal comes with a bowl of egg flour soup, a large helping of rice, and sauteed cabbage. The last item threw me for a loop. I normally like the idea of getting a veggie with my meal, but cabbage is never at the top of the list. It is cheap and adds little to a meal. My friends ordered the sweet and sour spareribs and a pork chow fun. The first item was not bad, they gave nice chunks of pork that were juicy. The sauce was lacking in flavor. It is a rare occasion for anyone to say Chinese food is lacking in seasoning. While the chow fun was nothing great. It wasn't even on the specials list. So for full price, the portion was small."}
{"text":"first of all the service is bad .i got hungry and wanna some food i love spicy food so i went to this restaurant for make my tasty happy but i sat there and waited for someone to ask me if i want some help but after 20 minutes I figured out that I have been ignored like a fucking idiot so I went to front of the desk to get the waiters but there was nobody after all of those shit i finally got my food but.         It tastes like shit it's not exactly what I thought l finished with upset i thought it was over but after 3 days l checked my online account and I found that I have been charged twice i called them immediately and they talked to with bad attitude like I was some douche bag trying to take advantage of them god damn it I called the bank without no choice so I hope I can have my money back"}
{"text":"Went in here for the lunch special. Portions were tiny. Orange chicken tasted like Dawn dish soap and each chicken piece was about 1/4 inch. 

Minced pork noodle dish had tiny bits of meat. Small enough to maybe fill the bellies of the four inch family members of the film, 'The Borrowers', and that's just an assumption.

The pork was mixed into a kiddie sized portion of Cellophane noodles, that appeared to be sauteed in regular soy sauce and sprinkled pathetically w/ bits of green onions. First bite is a shocker, but then cognizant dissonance kicks in, and you convince yourself that it's 'alright. . . I guess.' I could have made a couple packets of Spicy Chili Lime ramen at home and called it a day.  

As for the service. . .well . .typical vapid and rude wait staff you find in most chinatown restaurants nationwide. That's to be expected."}
{"text":"Very good food price was average the service does lack a little of attention but if you're in there for some quick Chinese that's the spot to go to. There is a language barrier so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Food, worst ever! I think I can make better than them. I ordered the Suzhou style noodle soup, meat is not fresh, soup? Joke, soy sauce with hot water!! I am serious, I was shocked and surprised someone will sale the product like this in Chinatown! The prob shirk ribs was deep fried, then stir fried with BBQ sauce, toooo sweat! I wish I could read the reviews next time! Please avoid this place, purely waste your money!"}
{"text":"You get your money's worth with a little extra. Also, vegetarian friendly~!

The atmosphere in the restaurant was so calm and collect. Ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and let me say it actually had me smiling while eating. The waitress was polite and asked the other customers, along with us, regularly if we needed anything. Definitely a favorite in Chinatown."}
