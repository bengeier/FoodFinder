{"text":"Just had a burger and Parmesan fries.  How can you mess that up!!!  Asked for the burger medium, it was black as the counter top it was so well done.   The fries were cold when they arrived.   On the up side the waitress was very friendly     I guess I should have take the recommendations she gave me.  She's the only reason I gave two stars."}
{"text":"I hardly ever right reviews but had to in this case, so the owners & mangers can take care of their business. Food was really good, but I was put off by poor service of the staff.  The hostess was not friendly by any means, not even a courtesy smile. When she asked if I wanted a high top or a low top she didn't even talk to me she asked in my general direction and I did not hear what she said.  I hate sitting in the middle of a dinning area and asked to sit somewhere not in the middle to which she showed me to another section where the table was in a similar spot.  I finally looked up and asked for a 2 top off to the side.  I get section seating but there is also customer preference.  It took about 10 min for my server to come to the table. He never introduced himself.  I ordered water with lime which took another ten minutes to get, no lime.  I ordered a house salad and the pesto chicken pasta which both came at the same time and I am pretty sure my pasta sat under the heating lamp for a while before it was served. The food was delicious but lukewarm. My server failed to fill my water or ask me if I wanted a refill on the first go round and I had to practically grab him to get my water to which he took my glass leaving me with nothing.  He referred to me as \" sweety\" and I could probably be his mother.  New water glass arrived and I did not see him for at least 20 min., luckily I have a long lay over... when I did see him. I was standing up on the other side of the table clearly ready to leave.  He was clearing the table behind me and I literally had to say \"excuse me, may I have my bill\". He did not have this prepared and had to walk away again.  Again food was great service sucked.  I won't recommend this on that account unless this changes."}
{"text":"My wife and I each had the sausage, egg toast with havarti for breakfast before an early morning flight. It was outstanding. The tomato onion roulade added just the right amount of heat. I don't travel to Charlotte often, but if I were, I wouldn't hesitate to pay a second visit to this place. It's a great place to fuel up before hopping on a plane!"}
{"text":"Don't ever get the beef salad unless you like a philly cheese steak drop on your salad. The French onion soups was room temp not hot."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for an airport restaurant. There are a number of tasty, healthy choices for travelers.   My girlfriend and I ate in the dining room. We each had salads; both were delicious. Also, all of the ingredients tasted very fresh. Despite the fact that we were there near closing time, the quality of service was still solid--quick turnaround between ordering and food, responsive server, and numerous refills. Overall, it's everything you would want from an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Very slowwwww service made us walk out. Over a half hour at 6am before we walked out .  Not sure where the sense of urgency is for such a large restaurant is a large airport.  Good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"The number one reason to enter a restaurant is to eat food there, the pizza took forever to arrive and then arrived cold. Our server didn't seem to want to be there today either. A shame that my only experience of this place was such a mediocre one, but there it is."}
{"text":"Stopped in this newly opened restaraunt in the Charlotte airport.  I ordered the Farmhouse salad... Came out in minutes.   Very nice mix of greens beets ... But noticed the goat cheese was missing after the fact. Waiter was prompt, friendly and professional.  This is a very new ( 2 weekdays) so I expect hiccups.  Will be back again"}
{"text":"Excellent and amazing food. Forgot I was even at the airport with a 3 hour layover. There's a deli and raw bar as additions. New restaurant and they are on an excellent track to outshine the other restaurants in the terminal. There's a beautiful lounge with couches and large TV to just chill or get some work done. Great staff very polite and timely. Offers plenty of tables with outlets for gadgets and such, but still manages to pull of a the look of a rustic bistro/market. Will be eating here on our return flight layover for sure!!! The Parmesan chicken tenders were fantastic and the Burger with BBQ Aioli was amazing. Also had the carved turkey sandwich with killer Parmesan fries! The place almost has a farm to table feel."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I love the burgers in this place, especially the Neese. However $3.29 FOR AN ICED TEA IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY!  The operator, HMS host should be sanctioned for this, and I'll be passing that tidbit along to the airport authority."}
{"text":"The onion soup is over salty , the burger was ok the American mule was OK but not good. I don't sure that I will stop again in this restaurant.  The classic American food is really weak!"}
{"text":"Had the turkey sandwich and it was pretty good. Turkey tasted delicious and the ingredients were fresh. Would have liked a little bit more salt on my fries.  Not a bad option for airport food. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Warning!!! If you are above average in size (and I don't mean obese), this restaurant's tables and chairs will be akin to a visit to hell for you. The chairs are horrible and the table legs are like razor blades if you bump into them. I had to move to a different place to finish my meal. One of the employees told me everyone says the same thing and they have told the owners but they won't listen. So, if they won't listen to an employee, maybe this review will help:  Your food is Great! I won't be back until you make it more comfortable to sit and eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant has replaced the Chili's which had been in the Charlotte airport since time immemorial (at least ten years).  It is deceptively small looking, but can accommodate an enormous number of people due to a clever reconfiguration of the space.  The best item on the menu is the Denise's country burger, a mix of sausage and beef in one patty with cheese, bacon and \"BBQ aioli\" (yes, the hipster is strong at 1897).  Ingredients are fresher than expected in an airport restaurant, and the menu is sensibly restrained.  The kitchen seems to focus on doing a few things well, instead of trying to do everything at once, and for the most part they succeed.    If you are lucky enough to get Zack as your waiter the airport will be a little less burdensome.  He is very attentive.  As airport restaurants go, 1897 Market is at the head of the pack."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, not good not bad just okay. However, the service here was very disappointing. First of all, both of hosteses were very unwelcoming. Upon our arrival, they did not smile or greet us. Server was friendly but never came by our table or refill our water cups. Will.not be coming to this restaurant at this airport ever again. They all seem like they hate their job or their lives. I definitely recommend not going to this place."}
{"text":"Good pizza and local brews....went to the deli/market on the backside.  Saves time if you're able to find a seat."}
{"text":"Finally had enough of a layover to try a new restaurant. Honestly this was good for airport food and prices. Lots of power outlets which is much appreciated in a airport that doesnt have the abundance of others. I had the roasted root vegetables appetizer and thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor. Burger was very good. Parmesan fries were cold but edible. Servers were pleasant but sloooooow and a bit inept. Still, the place has potential and is better than most airport experiences. Nice place to relax and recover. High counters have power. Far better than any Chili's, which I understand this replaced."}
{"text":"food is sooooooooooo amazingly delicious.  server was great, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had a pretty mediocre cold and overcooked $14 burger here. Cold bun was particularly annoying. Service was great(quick) so not all bad but go somewhere else if you want a decent burger."}
{"text":"Started with an Old Fashion and was happy I did. The whiskey cured cherries added a delicious flavor to this perfect drink. I followed it with the Salmon salad. Although it was a little over cooked the sweet crisp glaze complimented the salty flavor of the fish. If I ever fly through Charlotte again I will definitely drop by 1897 again. Great spot and well priced for the upscale eats in an airport."}
{"text":"Pleasantly satisfied with my breakfast here. Especially considering this is an airport institution and I'm not at the airport to eat, I would happily come here again.  - Tasty, solid food: Mostly \"classics\" and relatively simple ingredients. Nothing unusual or innovative, but the food tastes good. I had the open faced sandwich. - Quick, moderately priced meal: From order to delivery of food took just 10 minutes. Granted, this was breakfast and not peak time. Prices are acceptable.  - Relaxing atmosphere: If you have a long stopover, this is a wonderful place to sit and enjoy and meal or beverage. Happy, country chic vibe. Forget you are in the airport.  - Accommodating service: Servers and hostess are friendly and did not rush me. Have to ask for things (e.g., water, knife, etc.) and maybe more than once before it is delivered, which may be frustrating for some."}
{"text":"Had the French onion soup that was fantastic, very rich beef broth, crouton and cheese on top. Also had the shrimp and grits. This was cheese grits with bbq shrimp on top. Had arugula and tomato chunks with a Carolina style bbq sauce so you get the vinegar in the sauce. It was really good. I've seen reviews complaining about the price?? You do realize you are in an airport right??? Everything costs more at the airport. Service was also excellent. Not overbearing and not left to fend for yourself. I'll be back."}
{"text":"They're very serious about their breakfast hours ends at 1000. The previous airport was remodeling and had no restaurants open, so I wanted breakfast at 1030. They wouldn't even sell me two eggs. You can apparently add them to sandwiches, but not have them by themselves. Seeing as I didn't want to order a burger and throw away the sandwich just to eat an egg, I find myself eggless this morning. It makes absolutely no sense to me. The local beer was good though. Typically it's nice to work with your customers. Especially when they may be traveling and denied having eggs for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Well-- my waitress acts like she's too  too busy to get anything right. Slow down. Think. Food came out late, then wrong and then when I asked for a manager after 48 min waiting for food.. no manager came to chat....."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. This restaurant offers a welcome retreat from typical disappointing airport fare. The service was fast and friendly (thanks Raul)and the ambiance was nice too. Fun and funky decor, and creative and delicious dishes. I highly recommend the truffle chicken sandwich. Overall I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible service airport restaurant and waitress showed no urgency. I had to return my food because it was bad. They never sent me another meal"}
{"text":"I don't often have enough time for a sit down meal at airports but this holiday weekend I came insanely early. Security was quicker than I had feared, though, and I found myself with time for a real breakfast.  I couldn't have asked for a better place. A perfectly done omelet with sundried tomatoes and goat cheese, and some of the best bacon I have tasted. Service was quick and very genial. It's expensive, but I've paid as much in airports and gotten much less. They didn't refill the coffee and I didn't ask, didn't want to risk additional charge, but I am not going to let that minor objection keep me from giving the highest rating."}
{"text":"Walked out after sitting there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to at least provide water.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have to say airport food usually leaves me feeling unsatisfied BUT this restaurant is an exception. The salmon salad is amazing and super healthy. The staff is also on it! I don't feel like I'm in an airport. Nice job CLT."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped here for a layover 3rd week of May 2016.  99% sure she got her food poisoning from the burger here.  Washed hands prior to eating but unfortunately she spent the next 2 days with massive cramps and body aches and some not so pleasant GI issues.  Wouldn't recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I wish they had this place at every airport! Grilled chicken salad was infinitely fresher than nearby at CPK, with fun extra ingredients like quinoa and oatmeal. And with the honey walnut vinaigrette dressing it was actually really good. Great open layout with booths, tables, high tops, bar seating, couches. The only thing that would make this place even better would be wifi. Would love to come back whenever my plans take me through this airport."}
{"text":"Neese's Country Burger should be called the GAMECHANGER b/c it was hands down the best burger that we have had in our entire lives!!!! The sausage+beef mix is too savory to describe, you've just gotta try it for yourself    Be adventurous here people!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and service was great. This is definitely not your typical airport restaurant. The prices were reasonable and they had a full menu."}
{"text":"What a joke. This place appears to be beautiful and professional from the exterior but they do say \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Unless you've got four hours until you board your flight, you're better off eating questionable sushi in the NC airport. It took an hour for my husband and I to get a salad and a chicken sandwich... during this hour, four separate tables walked away without either being asked to order or receiving their food. When it arrives, it's alright, nothing to be excited about, and definitely NOT worth the hour wait. When I asked for ketchup, fifteen minutes went by, and I got up and asked someone for it and found five employees standing around in the wait station chatting while customers walked away from their tables. Again, what a joke."}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE.  Obviously new and trying to find their footing.  Sat for 10 minutes without being greeted by a server, walked out and no one said a word.  At least when this former location was a Chili's, you could depend on being able to eat."}
{"text":"The sun dried tomato and goat cheese (substituted w/ white cheddar)omelette is amazing. I've had it twice in the last 3 weeks while traveling through CLT and it was really good both times.   Service was spot on and attentive. A positive change from your typical airport restaurant experiences."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! I've been lucky enough to go through the airport a few times lately and I always made it a priority to stop in to eat or pick up something to go. The Parmesan Herb Chicken Tenders are delicious as well as the Carved Turkey & White Cheddar Omelet. What blew me away though was their breakfast pizza. It was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! So delicious and full of flavor. Excellent restaurant, do yourself a favor and stop by when you are in the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised about the food offerings here while waiting for our trip back to Vegas.  I ordered the goat cheese salad with salmon.  It was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I came here during my layover at Charlotte Int'l. I was looking for a place with good food and drinks. I ordered the chicken sandwich which was pretty tasty. It had a real chicken breast (not that fake processed stuff), and it also came with their garlic Parmesan fries. I wasn't a big fan of those because they seemed like frozen fries. The waitress recommended a local Amber beer which was also good. She was kind and attentive. It's a good place to dine at if you're in the airport."}
{"text":"The service is 4-Star.  They lost a star because they would not substitute the type of salad (they had Apple Pear, I just wanted a simple house salad because of my diet protocol). You can't make this up, wouldn't substitute a cheaper type salad----disappointed as many venues understand customers are ordering low-carb meals to improve their health.  Overall, this is a nice venue and the service has always been friendly.  Portions are nice and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Such a great place for a layover. Way way way better than the chili's that used to be there. Good healthy choices, nice lounge if you need a nap, and a great bar."}
{"text":"1897 gives you options for fresh food at the airport which is appreciated. You can also grab something for the road from deli/grocery side of the restaurant. The service is friendly and prompt.   A good place to get a nice meal."}
{"text":"I know this is an airport but $17 cocktails is a bit extreme in my opinion.  Burger was ok...side salad was good.  Service was friendly but took way too long."}
{"text":"Best airport food ever!  If you sat on the inside or didn't face the interior of the hall you would not believe you were in an airport. Great beer selection. Fresh foods!  AMAZING French onion soup. So cheesy!  Miranda was a great server."}
{"text":"Server REBECCA 325087 increased her own tip, so watch out for that one.    Fries were cold, overwhelming seasoning. Service was slow. I asked for no tomato on sandwich, but it had tomato on it. Yucky seeds and tomato \"goo\" ruins it for me, but I didn't send it back because it was so slow and I was starving. I'm glad I didn't send it back. Rebecca steals so she probably spits in food, too (or worse)."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a layover. Ordered their fries - outstanding and two glasses of wine. The service is good and quick. They close at 10, which was a bummer since my flight was later. Key point is at the bar they have tons of electrical outlets, which is super helpful in the airport."}
{"text":"Notes: vegetarian, celiac.  After traveling through ATL airport recently and having an awful meal at Cafe Intermezzo, I was not thrilled with the idea of an airport restaurant salad.  But the Farmhouse Salad here was delicious.  I damn near licked the plate.  The Brava Potatoes were close to perfect.  I will stop here every time I fly through CLT.  Well done y'all.  Doing NC proud."}
{"text":"A complete waste of money. Terrible shrimp and grits. Overpriced. Slow inattentive service."}
{"text":"Terrible service, wrong appetizer order, lukewarm soup. Wings were good though. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The salmon was excellent and Karl's service was on point.  Easily the best meal I've had in an airport and the restaurant would do well in any market."}
{"text":"I will be honest, I was very excited to see a \"farm to table\" restaurant pop up at the Charlotte airport. Finally something better than Wendy's and Starbucks! I really wanted to like this restaurant but sadly it just did not live up to expectations.   First waitstaff was great, very friendly and warm. They gave a true representation of southern hospitality and service.   However once the food came out I was greatly disappointed. I came in for breakfast and ordered the Carolina scrambler. It promised, cheese grits, bacon, biscuit and eggs and an arugula salad tossed in a Tabasco vinaigrette. Bacon came out soggy and soft and the vinaigrette was missing. Staff was accommodating and brought the vinaigrette on the side but by the time I got it my eggs and grits were cold.   I believe this place could be better if the cook staff paid better attention to their plates and ensured each plate came out to southern standards."}
{"text":"Great for airport food. Get a sandwich made as the grab and goes are a little soggy. Fresh food and healthy options. Expensive!!!!!! But better than the usual trash you eat at an airport."}
{"text":"I can't comment on lunch or dinner but breakfast is not their strong suit.  The Slam sounds good on the menu but it neglects to mention that every thing is piled on top of each other--eggs, grits, salad.  Ask for the standard condiments such as ketchup,  jam, butter and the waitress had to dole it out in small plastic cups--apparently these items are not considered part of the faire."}
{"text":"Boy talk about the left hand NOT knowing (or giving a s_it) about the right hand... Just asked for a simple pimento cheese sandwich from the take out part - which had been no problem last month...\"you have to go to the dine in area\" ok we did... THEN our waitress acted like she had no idea what we wanted all the while saying, \"I understand what you are saying\"...finally she said, \"I'm just going to bring you a grilled cheese\"...WTF?? We reported the situation to the \"manager\" to no real effect I will definitely avoid it in the future Such a different experience from a month ago..."}
{"text":"For two burgers and two cocktails my husband and I paid  $80 with the tip. I never ordered double Margarita, they made it double ($18). Also they don't show prices on a cocktail list which is extremely sneaky. Service was very pushy. By the way, the server recommended margarita. No wonder why... Do not recommend. Extremely overpriced even for airport food."}
{"text":"Food is well below average even for an airport..... much better options in the terminal. The restaurant looks very nice, but that's where the good ends, from here it's bland food, which is luke warm with little taste.... this is my second try, and final attempt."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because this is one of the better options at CLT.     ---   ---   ---  \"Eatin' good\" is tough to do while traveling, so I set a very low standard for meal with this pass-through: find something healthy. I chose 1897 because their mission was fresh food, and they had a few different salad options.  And then I ordered the pretzel burger because I have a problem.  My burger was solid, but I was kicking myself for passing on the french onion soup. I sat at the end of the bar, right next to the open kitchen and watched delicious french onion soup being distributed time after time after time. I will definitely be trying that out on my next visit. My parmesan fries were fine, in its place.  The only gripe I had was that during my visit, the Charlotte Hornets were playing a playoff Game 7, and the TV's were on ESPN2, which had bowling on. I asked a couple times for them to switch the TV's, but it didn't happen until about my 5 minutes before I had to leave. That may sound nit-picky, but how do you not have your local team's big playoff game on, and why does it take 15-20 minutes to change the channel?  At any rate, this will probably be my stop at future visits to the airport. Next time, I'll get the salad (and the french onion soup, of course.)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Food was great, service fantastic and really great atmosphere for the airport! Trent was a great waiter, super friendly and completely on point! So appreciate the attention to customer service!!"}
{"text":"I hope the kitchen knows that there working in the Airport speed is a necessity. Imagine there were hardly NO people in the establishment."}
{"text":"Typical airport joint. Don't let the facade fool you. Burger - uninspired. Fries - ice cold. Best thing I can say is that the beer prices are modest for an airport bar and they have local craft options."}
{"text":"Food seemed like it was premade and threw on a plate, room temperature. Service very slow."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat at CLT airport by far and have been here many times.  Great beer, good food.  I especially recommend the pizza and salmon salad.  However, this visit was a bit of a disappointment.  The burger ordered medium was well done with cold soggy fries.  Attempt number two resulted in a much better cooked burger to temp but lacked any real flavor, and the fries were still soggy.  The waitress may have been overwhelmed today but didn't even check to see how the recook was.  Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Farmers salad with radish, mixed greens, beets, goat cheese and granola was so tasty with the buttery Salmon. Waitress Candy was a pleasure and great with customer service. Nice atmosphere...Open kitchen for a good view of cooking and food prep.  Give it a try. I'll be back if I pass thru  Charlotte Airport, NC between gates B and C. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pit stop in NC. Great concept - Grab and go market style or full service, casual dining or less casual dining, entirely up to you. Plant your laptop on the table and wifi works seamlessly while you dig into their well prepared light meals and good drinks while waiting for a plane. Nothing more nothing less, bliss and perfect"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best burgers I've ever had. I have sent so many people here. I travel every week and used to always eat here. But today's customer service experience has sealed their fate. I have had over an hour wait. I have been bathed at by bartenders, and I have been told I cannot call in a to-go order. Really? You don't want my money? Fine."}
{"text":"If you want to forget all your troubles order the Cable Car! My carnivorous-only eating partner loved it. I think he forgot about his go-to Grand Marnier....He ordered the 1lb of buffalo chicken wings. They were ok. Great portion, large wings, but not enough sauce and I think they were slightly undercooked. I had the French onion soup and roasted root vegetables w/goat cheese. Both were amazing and so filling. We stuck to appetizers because they were rather pricey, but offer a wonderfully fresh menu of salmon, shrimp, trout and creative pizzas and burgers at the airport."}
{"text":"For an airport, this might be 5 stars. I saw a few pilots eating here, which is always a great sign. They have fresh food to go, beer and wine you can drink there, or table service. The check out person was very friendly. I like the decor and the tvs that show football games, etc. Visit the hostess table for dining in. There are high top tables with outlets if you are doing the to go options."}
{"text":"This guy responded to me asking for help by saying \"I'm off the clock\" while standing in the lounge with his badge on. The dumbest thing I've ever heard a server say to a customer. I'll never eat hear again."}
{"text":"Airport market with quick food and drinks. The secret is the back area lounge hidden away from the bustle of the main area with comfy couches and seating, power outlets to charge and a TV. It's also decently quite. The rest of the market is similar to an open indoor market feel with multiple food stalls, but much smaller and tighter walking areas."}
{"text":"Hands down best airport food. Actually excellent food all around.  The spinach and mozzarella pizza was awesome. The young lady that took care of me \"Chanae\" was incredible. She was attentive and on her game.  Having had some experience in the restaurant arena, I know for sure she is a real asset to The business"}
{"text":"A must stop at the CLT airport!!   Why waste time with the normal fast food places when you can enjoy the same type place you search for on Yelp?   The food is spot on and the service is friendly. If you are tight on time to catch your next flight let them know. They are very accommodating.   Pro Tip: Tight on time, but still want to sit down and enjoy your meal? Ask for the check as you order your food. One less thing to wait for.   Now that we got through all the reasons why you wanted fast food and didn't stop at this gem, let's talk about the food:  Tried the Reese's Country burger. I highly recommend it. Don't add anything extra to it ( i.e. Ketchup, mustard... ) just take a bite, it's burger bliss as is... The parmesan cheese fries go really well with this burger."}
{"text":"Well I stopped here for breakfast after I saw the reviews. Waitress was friendly. Food  was sub par. The eggs were hard cooked and I was told the cheese did it. . Really and she was serious. The potatoes were cold and I had 10 on my plate. The grits were room temperature and bland. This stood up to airport food. I think had the grits been warm they would of been a hit. The eggs were lost in transition"}
{"text":"I remember this spot back when it was just a crappy Chili's. Good to see it on the come up since then. The decor and vibe are where most of the love in this review comes from. Huge TV's, a large spacious layout with a modern and trendy presentation and the ability to watch the chefs prepare the food all really made me excited about eating here   The menu is large with burgers and a few other staples to offer. The service was really great too. My waiter was eager to please, enthusiastic, and checked in on me often. This was especially appreciated since it was really busy.   I went with the mushroom and spinach pizza which was decent but not great. Guess overall o couldn't complain too much as it was pretty good given the bar for airplane foods. Just dont go in expediting to have your socks blown off. the drinks, however, are where I take issue. Because none of the cocktails handpicked I asked my waiter how much they were, generally. He told me \"$13-$15 range,\" which I was cool with because it seemed reasonable. So I ordered the Pisco Sour, a whiskey sour knock off. The shit was $17. It was a fine drink but I've NEVER heard of a damn two bit whiskey sour impression costing SEVENTEEN AMERICAN DOLLARS. If you're going to feature a cocktail costing that much at least have the courtesy to list the price or warn your customers PROPERLY before letting them order one.   Over all, this spot was just decent. Go here if stuck in the airport for awhile."}
{"text":"Thank you so much! After 3 days of scant meals of cobbled together airport and conference food I finally had a fulfilling/satisfying meal!   Got here during a dinner rush so I waited a couple minutes in line before I was seated. Once seated, I was a bit concerned that I did not immediately see a server (I only had 40 min), but one soon emerged to take my order. The staff is quick here, not exactly warm/welcoming, but given the location, speed is preferred to hospitality!  I ordered a fabulous, but over-priced, glass of Malbec and the quinoa salmon salon. Both food and drink came out fast! I was so impressed with my salad! The salmon had a really nice crust and served over a bed of fresh and plentiful greens. I was also quite keen on the salad dressing, which was a walnut vinaigrette.   I will definitely be back here seeing as though it was my second favorite airport meal ever (first place goes to the delicious salad I had at Rick Bayless's place in the Atlanta airport)."}
{"text":"Quality and flavor of the food was great. The service was AWFUL. I'm sitting 5 feet from the prep window and somehow my food was delivered cold. Also, Shannon, the waitress pretty much forgot I was there. Waited over 10 minutes for coffee. Next time I'll go to the self serve area."}
{"text":"Five stars for airport food. Got hand carved turkey. Tender and tasty and lots of . Side salad was big and good. All and all yummy  experience."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was extremely slow and disorganized.  I waited 20 minutes before being asked to order.  I don't think anyone knew what tables they were covering.  I never got a refill on my drink."}
{"text":"Wow, really surprised to find such a good place in an airport!  The Charlotte Burger was the best I've had in months. Parmesan fries were tasty if a little salty. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"As an airline pilot I am always looking for something good to eat that's not the generic airport food. On this evening I felt like a really good hamburger and saw that the 1897 market was available. After a short wait to get in, the staff seated me at a very nice table. The waiter was very prompt and suggested the \"country burger\" when I asked him what he liked.  The burger came very promptly and was truly one of the best burgers I've had in my life. Very juicy, and I had to eat the last few bites with a knife and a fork but that's not a complaint - it's a compliment because of how juicy it was. I also like to complement the waitstaff. Everyone was very friendly and very prompt. I appreciate good service and tip accordingly, and this staff should definitely receive high marks. I will definitely be back on my next stop over at Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to 1897, I decided to try it out this morning after a late night cancelled flight and spending the rest of the night in the airport waiting to catch a morning flight.  I got the classic breakfast and substituted the home fries for grits and boy was I glad.  The grits were fabulous without my adding any extra seasoning.  Bacon was crisp and over easy eggs were cooked perfectly.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Myself and a couple of colleagues had lunch here and the pizza was great.  We all also ordered Bloody Mary I would have to say it was worst I've ever had.  We didn't even finish the they were so bad.  For the 3 of us I paid $50 for the worst drinks. That was a rough. That's why it's a 3 star not higher."}
{"text":"I recently had a layover in the Charlotte airport and stopped by 1897 Market for a quick bite. It was actually my second time there. Last time I was at 1897, they didn't have the bar section, or maybe I didn't see it. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised to see this section of the restaurant and to spot oysters on the menu! Both, the drinks and the oysters, were pretty good and reasonably priced. Places like 1897 Market help make traveling much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here and ordered the burger and wreck roast beef sandwich.  Both were very good, and the accompanying parmesan fries were delicious!  The ambiance of the restaurant is very neat, and the staff is helpful, friendly, and fun.   The food is slightly overpriced, paying over $30 for two sandwiches (and only waters to drink), but it's at the airport so that seems typical.  We would eat here again."}
{"text":"And it was quite a good Turkey Salad!  The turkey was still warm, the lettuce crisp and the Blue Cheese dressing outstanding.  I have seen this location many times but didn't have time to try it.  Today the flight from Chicago was in 40 minutes early and beat the lunch crowd so I stopped.  And I am glad I did for the food.  But unfortunately the service was poor.  When I arrived they were not crowded but it took a while to get a menu from the waiter, Richard, and then another wait to place my order.   The meal came quickly, delivered by someone else.  And then I didn't see Richard again until 10 minutes after I finished.  Then I had to stare him down to get the bill so I could pay and leave to catch my next flight.  This poor level. of course lowered the overall score.  One thing I don't understand is why the trend started to pile all the ingredients separately around the the salad instead of distributing or mixing them over the entire salad so that you can get a combination of the flavors.  This trend bothers as much as the practice of piling the meat or fish on top of potatoes or something else.  I don't understand why they do it."}
{"text":"Good place to sit down and eat a decent meal in a pretty crowded and busy airport. This place is rather strange. Coming in from concourse B, you see a door and stairs. this takes you into a kind of store of some sort. Weave through there, and you come into a small restaurant kind of place. The entrance and seating person from the restaurant is in the atrium area. The omelet I had was pretty good, but not anything special. Service was ok but not inspiring. All in all it was better than a fast food place, and at least it was relatively quiet."}
{"text":"If you are fortunate Rebecca will be your server!  Courteous and kind and keeps an eye on your flight time!  Excellent airport cuisine!  Ordered the rich tasty Mac n cheese treat with root vegetables side and the salad with Salmon!  Best red wine selection~the Bordeaux won't disappoint!  The experience made me forget I was I am airport!  Worthwhile dining experience while waiting for connecting flight!!"}
{"text":"I was at Charlotte for a layover and liked the look of this restaurant. When I arrived the restaurant was only about 40% full, and there were lots of servers and staff about. I was seated adjacent to a take out area and advised my server would be along...many servers walked around and milled about and I waited for mine. The wait was not extreme but definitely longer than it needed to be. The selection was not extensive but I ordered a French onion soup and roasted vegetables. Both were just a little more than lukewarm and the French onion soup was greatly over salted. I only ate about half of my meal. I would have alerted my server except that she never came by to check on my meal and had to ask one of the other servers to ask her to bring my bill. And, I also had to wait for that for longer than necessary. When she did I advised that the food was below par and her manager gave me a 10% discount. The whole experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"If you have to eat at an airport, hope that you get stuck in Charlotte. I love the atmosphere, you can't even tell you're in an airport. It is comfortable and cozy. I had a turkey sandwich with parmesan fries. The sandwich was incredible. It has been over a week and I'm still thinking about how good it was. Maybe it was because I was eating guacamole and tortilla chips everyday in Mexico for a week and needed to break up the monotony? The fries were ok, but I have had better. There wasn't enough parmesan on them. Drinks are served in these gorgeous green glasses. This place is like an oasis compared to the fast food you usually find in an airport."}
{"text":"Good quick service for an airport meal. I've tried their pizzas and salads before and have never been disappointed. They have generous portions and a nice sit-down atmosphere. TONS of seating in the restaurant and the ability to purchase some of their food for take out. There's also a little market in the back to take snacks and drinks to go. It's definitely the best one stop place to go before taking off"}
{"text":"This place has swag! Great location between gates and lots of options from quick service or sit down meal, or just grabbing a pizza at the bar. Each table and stool has a electrical outlet. Finally! Someone gets it!  The burger was great. The sushi place is always crowded so come here for a more relaxing meal without people bumping over your luggage. Service was great which is another plus for an airport eatery."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a few trips so I made it a point to get to the airport with enough time for breakfast. The place was fairly empty and I feel like my service was fine so I'm not sure if they fixed the issues others had with long waits or if I just went at a good time. The breakfast menu looked good enough, but I wanted an omelet anyway.  I debated between the veggie and Turkey (it is nice to have more than one option that isn't pork).  I ordered the turkey and it came out in a timely fashion.  Since it was early I didn't check out their beer selection, but it sounds like I will have good options when I am back for dinner sometime.  Their prices are on par with airport prices but it seems like better food than Chili's Too had.  Bad Daddy's in C is a good spot for breakfast too, but I like to have more options near A since that is where I usually fly out of."}
{"text":"Newly opened. I hope they can maintain the good service and food. Happy and pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a \"date\" here when we were stuck in the Charlotte Airport for a few hours.  The menu is small but you can get sandwiches, salads, or entrees so there is something for anyone.  Its an open kitchen concept so I like that I can see what's going on with my food.  I had a chicken sandwich and my husband had a burger.  Both were really good.  The meats were juicy and the toppings were spot on.  The fries were coated in parmesan and were crispy and hot.  The service was friendly but on this night kind of on the slow side.  No biggie when we needed something, we got it, so it didn't hold us up at all.  The pilot at the table next to us had a pasta dish that looked amazing.  I'll have to try that sometime.   All in all a good choice for a nice relaxing dinner at the airport.  If we didn't have our suitcases next to us I would have never guessed I was in an airport."}
{"text":"Love the fact they would make a salad fresh and Allow  a substitution with a smile on their face - it's the old chili's over near Starbucks - I'll be back on Friday :)"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. I fly through Charlotte often and was excited to find this place. A great menu and nice wine selection in an upscale feeling place. Each time I pass through I give it \"one more chance\". The food is good, if you don't mind being treated rudely by pretty much everyone you speak to, by all means, try this place out."}
{"text":"So much Parmesan. Why so much? Why? The fries were suffocating with it, the chicken strips were covered in it...why? And weirdly this seemed to be the \"government cheese\" equivalent of it -- tasteless, with little to no distinguishable flavor and provided in inexplicable excess.   Other than that, this is probably the better place to eat in this (kind of whatever, but better than it used to be) airport.   Maybe try ordering something else? Although I did notice that the Caesar salad was also hidden under a thick blanket of the chef's favorite condiment...Parmesan. ?"}
{"text":"This breakfast completely exceeded my expectations. I really wasn't expecting to enjoy food in an airport but this was excellent and the portion was very generous. The toast was sourdough bread. The hash browns were real thick cut potatoes and the star of the plate was the bacon. It was thick cut and just very slightly sweet. It was crispy and perfectly cooked. It made my airport layover in Charlotte very pleasant. Cute place too!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar on the terminal side.  Asked for a menu and as the waitress/bartender handed it to me she asked if i knew what I wanted or if I needed some time.......ummmm. I just asked you for a menu.  Can I at least open it and see what you have.    A few mins later placed order for turkey Cobb salad.  a gentlemen then sat down next to me and proceeded to order same item.   10 minutes pass and the waitress brings out the salad and says to me \"yours is coming right up\".   After 20 more mins and 2 inquiries my salad arrives.  Guy next to me finishes his salad and says \"you must have pissed someone off\".  The salad is pretty good and huge.  Service is pretty mediocre and the attitude of the blonde behind the bar needs a serious adjustment.  Some people should not be customer facing and she is certainly one of them."}
{"text":"My most recent layover was in Charlotte where I had a hungry stomach and 3 hours to kill.  So, I was looking for a spot I could grab a bite and write some Yelp reviews like a good Yelp nerd would.  1897 Market was my spot.  There were a lot of spots on the wall with outlets for charging and electronics using, but have your back to everyone else and I'm not cool with that at the airport: too many weirdoes walking around snooping and doing other weird things.  I asked to sit at a table on the wall and got a good spot.  The food wasn't too bad.  I went with my server's (Zach) advice and order the shrimp and grits.  It went against my better judgment of what I know about food cost to quantity/quality ratio, but I took his advice and it worked out well.  I also got a side salad as well.  Funny thing, but the side salad was served in an odd shaped bowl similar to a soap dish.  It had a weird dip in it; it wasn't quite a bowl but certainly was not a dish.  I had a hard time keeping my tomatoes from squirting up over the sides, rolling off and committing tomatocide off the edge of the table (one actually did).  It wasn't a big deal, but then some French guy the next table over kept coughing up a lung like he had \"la bubonic plague\" or something, and I started to wonder if I made the right choice of dinner spots.  Then the main course came out and I was relieved.  The shrimp and grits were very good.  The grits came with cheese melted in them, and could have passed for some homemade mashed potatoes.  They also garnished the dish with arugula which gave it a zesty spice.  Last but not lease, there was plenty of shrimp to my delight."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. The service was very poor.   For an airport restaurant I would expect them to try and push you out. Not my waitress nor the others. I had to ask for a knife, then jelly then the check. I had to ask a manager for the knife. I was never asked if I wanted my water refilled. If you decide to eat here and get a waitress named Jessica I suggest you run away."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and not very busy went I came for lunch. Ordered a burger and fries that took over 35 min to come out. I think they were slaughtering the cow in the back for as long as it came out. The Parmesan fries came out warm and stale like they been sitting out for a while and this was the same for the burger. Super overpriced."}
{"text":"The biggest disappointment in Charlotte-Douglas. The huge restaurant/store looks like a great environment with its farmers market feel. It can get crowded. The food is good enough. I enjoy the pancakes and bacon. It's real bacon.   I'd probably give this restaurant a rating of 3 or 4 stars if it weren't for the consistently horrible service!! I've given this restaurant numerous chances to get it right, but they continuously fail.  Inattentive servers may or may not get around to you in a timely manner. They may get your food out to you while it's still warm. And, if your lucky, you'll get the check taken care of before you have to race to your gate to make your flight. But, I have yet to visit this restaurant and not have to get a manager involved just to get my check or my food. Not that THAT helps. The managers I've experienced have been just as lackadaisical about the service as the servers.   I've given up on this restaurant. Good luck making your flight of you eat there."}
{"text":"I had the truffle chicken sandwich and a side salad. The side salad was tasteless but the truffle chicken sandwich was quite good. Good truffle flavor, well cooked chicken, and overall pleasant flavor."}
{"text":"I'm grading on a curve since this is an airport restaurant.  Having said that, the food is good and priced fairly.  I've had the sirloin steak a few times and it's a decent size and well prepared (e.g., medium rare).  The French onion soup is pretty good, too.  It's become my go-to place alternating with the Carolina BBQ spot."}
{"text":"I can't review the food because I couldn't even get a drink. Basically, it's a ten minute rule. If I am not greeted by a server in ten minutes, I will find somewhere else to dine. Might be an appropriate restaurant name, it's probably the last time they served a patron in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"This was the worst food and drink experience I have ever had in an airport. The place was crowded and looked like a great spot for a drink and some lunch between flights. We ordered a round of bloody Mary's that were literally warm on the bottom and chilled at the top. Tasted like sweet clam juice. Terrible!!!  I wasn't completely turned off at this point since some places just don't know how to make a good Bloody Mary. We then ordered the french onion soup because I saw several go by the table and it looked delicious. The soup itself was luke warm with soggy croutons. The cheese on top however looked amazing. After eating the cheese off the top, I was over the soup. They were scooping the warm soup out of a container and then putting cheese on top and in the oven to melt. Flavor not good and barely warm. Next  was our grilled chicken and mushroom sandwich. Thank god we got one to share because we weren't starving. My boyfriend scarfed his half down (which doesn't say much because he'll eat anything) and when I went to take the first bite the smell alone was a no go. The bread was stale and the smell was horrific. I took a half a bite and spit out in my napkin. Our waitress came around and picked up my half of sandwich and fries that I didn't touch, the soup missing the cheese only and two bloody Mary's 3/4 full and never once asked how the meal was. That was the worst $65 I have ever spent in my life. I typically don't write reviews but if I can save someone from eating at this place it's worth it. Wish I would have grabbed a chic filet sandwich instead!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Airport Restaurant!  1897 Market is a cross between a cool rustic bistro and a market.  I had the Reuben from the Deli area and it was fantastic.  My friend started with 1/2 dozen oysters from the raw bar and followed it up with a fantastic burger (he says the best he has ever had, it has homemade pickles on it!).  We both had a Manhattan that was made perfectly.  The service was friendly and prompt, the music was great and the whole place had a real cool vibe.  Little did we know that our flight would be delayed so we went back and grabbed a local IPA out of the cooler and sat in the back area where they have big overstuffed chairs and couches.  I will never visit the US Airways club again.  This lounge area in the back is my new go to spot on CLT layovers!  Can't wait to get back to CLT to try the hand tossed pizza.  The table next to us ordered one and it looked and smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"Exceeded any expectations for a place to sit your travel weary bones.   This place is nice. There is a living room area with couches, comfy chairs, coffee tables and end tables at each chair. They decorated tastefully and for a moment you feel like you are at a hotel lobby.   The other sides have well appointed bar tables with outlets aplenty. There are ample choices when it comes to seating.  The food selection looks fresh and good. They have some refrigerated sections and some tables with fun merchandise, even highlighting local Charlotte businesses.   The music is a tad on the loud side, depending on what is playing, but I get the need to drown out the airport noise. Bring your earbuds if you have sensitive ears.   If you get to the airport early or have a layover, this is the place to wait."}
{"text":"Stopped over for a layover and had dinner here. Was drawn in by the awesome Decor and style. This was by far the best airport meal I have ever eaten! The French onion soup was incredible as well as their salads and wings. The California mule was one of the best I've had as well. Very fresh! Really wish they had a location in California because I think it would do incredible!"}
{"text":"I stopped here because i wanted something fresh and healthy but quick before a flight. From a food standpoint this was hands down delicious! I had a salmon salad and everything included was delicious and in the right amount. What was included with my meal, i could have done without. The hostesses were rude, disrespectful, cursed under their breath, at one point i heard a hostess say \"omg if they don't hurry the hell up\" as she was escorting 4 elderly patrons to their table. The saving grace of their staff was my server, Trent. He was polite, gracious, and appeared to enjoy his job. I'd suggest ordering food to go here, and enjoying it in an atmosphere that is much more about hospitality. And yes, even in an airport you can have hospitality"}
{"text":"After sitting waiting for 40 minutes after ordering and others eating their food that walked in before me, I had to walk out without eating my one meal for the day!  As a Consultant who flies as many as 198 times per year, I'll be banning this place and telling all my fellow consultants to nix this place as well!"}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary was pretty good though a bit more spicy than I like it. Mind you...I like spice but a good Mary doesn't need too much.  Do not get the BBQ shrimp and grits if you are from the south! They are acrid. The tomatoes are so acidic they turn your mouth against the remainder of the dish. Arugula is a garnish...remember that. The shrimp are really good and the grits on their own. The watery gravy they drown the dish in ya not needed or very good in the dish.  I was really hoping to enjoy this meal especially since I travel through the airport often! Oh well, I will not try it again. It is unfortunate there are other things that sound great on the menu. But so did the BBQ shrimp and grits. The hungry traveler!"}
{"text":"How confusing is this place? I think the multiple entrances is not a plus. Only one is staffed by a host. Nice choice of wine and while I didn't have one, the salads look fantastic. I had the meaty pizza, it was good but a bit doughy and undercooked. A great improvement from Chili's!"}
{"text":"Ok so it's the airport and you have some time to kill or for some reason your gate gets changed and you miss the flight and have to kill 5 hrs.  This place is what I hope for in a place where I am basically a prisoner.   Yes it's over priced but they have a place at nearly every table to plug in your devices. We sampled some local beers on tap and enjoyed a fresh made wood fired pizza on the leg out. On the way back we stopped again and shared a burger and Parmesan fries. All food was tasty and fresh. Open kitchen means no surprises. The place appeared brand new and was sparkling clean.  It is \"Market Style\" with a Raw Bar station a Pizza Station and a Grill and Salads station. Food was served in a timely manner and our waiter Caesar was very professional and great at the upswell/suggestive sell of his products."}
{"text":"Be sure to check out 1897 Market the next time you travel through Charlotte Douglas Int'l. Dining or quick carryout avaliable. They have craft beer, I was told locally made bourbon and other local products. We looked for the bourbon but later told by the server they were out of stock. The restaurant lost a star due to the temp of the fries. My wife ordered the blackened, grilled shrimp on sourdough bread slice with pickled onion, Arugula and a basil pesto spread. \"Deeelicious\"! I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, cooked to a perfect juicy medium. However, the fries were not warm. Probably sat on the plate while waiting for the burger to get plated. I wish restaurants would figure out how to fix this. Cold fries happens way too much.  We both had a local craft beer. Excellent and not a bad deal for the 20 oz. pour.   The server caused the restaurant to lose a star because we were not provided enough napkins (one). What was worse, after she said she would be back, we eventually had to get up ourselves to get our own until she finally arrived to our table. I've seen some hit/miss reviews but we experienced a nice time and a great meal."}
{"text":"Honestly the best airport food I've ever had. Nothing comes close. The staff is nice and attentive. Sitting by the kitchen proves to you just how good these chefs are. Overall great experience and makes CLT an airport I look forward to visiting."}
{"text":"This place lacks customer service. We were apparently interrupting social time and they kept forgetting our waters and didn't bring out ketchup until the end of our meal.  Food is ok.  On the greasy side....different restaurant next time I pass through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wow! Really amazed at how great this place is! Everything perfect from being seated, to the great tunes, the friendly, attentive and mine happened to be very easy to look at waiter!, and mostly the food. Might be one of the best salads I've had, and def best airport meal ever. And I travel a lot!"}
{"text":"OMG! I have found the pinnacle of airport food. This place offers a great atmosphere, varied menu and the best airport food in the U.S. I started with a half dozen oysters and their signature Old Fashioned, both prepared perfectly. Followed by the salmon salad, served with a exquisite house dressing and granola. If I lived in Charlotte, this place would be a frequent stop. The downside would be getting through security without a boarding pass :)"}
{"text":"Burger was good and the pizza was great. Any pasta here is really weird and the flavors are off. The fries are a little under seasoned. Plus I had a small drink less than four ounces and the price was $16! Had I had know this, which the menu doesn't show a price too well, I would have gotten a beer somewhere else. Plus the dirty Mac and cheese is horrible!   Not a good place. Stick to sbarro."}
{"text":"I had a layover in Charlotte, and upon discovering my flight had been delayed, decided to scope out the restaurant offerings. My research led me to 1897 Market and I'm glad -- not a bad place to stumble upon (especially when airport food tends to be overpriced, underflavored and overall boring)  I was seated fairly quickly and greeted by friendly staff. To start, I ordered a jalapeño beer. It was nice to see some local NC craft beers on their beer list.   For food, I ordered the spinach & mushroom pizza, as well as the brava potatoes. The pizza was great -- good flavors, decent size for the price (one person could eat the whole thing, but it would also be good for sharing if everyone ordered their own entree as well). The brava potatoes were a total miss, in my opinion. I've ordered similar dishes elsewhere and thought the ones here were way too dry. They were essentially potato wedges tossed in a very minimal amount of sauce. Sorry, but I'd definitely say pass on those.   The other downside is that there is no restroom inside the actual restaurant -- you have to leave and walk to another portion of the airport (which was a bummer as a solo traveler because I couldn't just leave the table mid-meal to find a restroom)  The menu had a lot of variety and there were a few other dishes that piqued my curiosity. If I ever find myself in this airport again, I'd certainly come back to check out more of the offering."}
{"text":"Great travel choices for the health conscious travelers out there.. 1 thing I hate about airport food is the healthy clean choices are few and far between.  Here the sell a host of choices from hand made pizza, really wholesome salads without the extra junk on top, and other choices.  The also carry kombucha, have a raw bar, and artisan baked goods as well as freshly brewed coffee.   This will be my first choice whenever catching a connection in Charlotte"}
{"text":"We had been in Spain all week and had a long layover on the way home to St. Louis.  There appear to be a lot of good options at the Charlotte Airport but we decided we needed some solid food and a quiet sit down and we got both. Quick, friendly service by Raoul, fresh brewed iced tea (with lots of ice unlike Europe) and a great meal. Sandy got the the burger and I got the steak frites and other were excellent. The Parmesan fries were also very good but not as hot or crisp as \"perfect\" would be. The steak was a medium grade with a tardy peppercorn sauce on the side and no fat. Not traditional but really good. If you have missed beef... this place satisfied a powerful need."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is delicious.  Everyone else's food looked amazing.  After 45 minutes of waiting, I decided to ask for my order to be cancelled.  All the manager could say was I'm sorry, and then offered me a soup to go.  Thanks bro.  Incompetent employees are the evidence of incompetent leadership, and you Sir have an incompetent staff of folks who really could care less.  Glad I still had to pay for the drink I had while waiting....."}
{"text":"While I am never excited to hang in the airport, if I find myself with extra time in CLT, 1897 Market is my go-to place.  To be clear, this is not a review of the restaurant itself - I've never sat down and had a meal here.  But, if you head to the back area, there's a little market with snacks and sandwiches and, if you keep going, a seating area with really comfortable couches and chairs.    Extra time - do yourself a favor and avoid stress by relaxing here."}
{"text":"The seared Salmon is absolutely perfect! Fresh and A LOT of food. The staff is fantastic and the food is fast. Atmosphere is feat and the place is spotless. Recommend sitting at the food bar inside to watch the Chefs. Incredible treat. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I guess we should be lucky these folks showed up for work and are here for us to inconvenience.  Don't let me bother you by expecting eye contact and a greeting.  By all means please continue to discuss how Latisha and Dwayne had an argument and that you need to get your weave and nails done.  Aside from the at best \"Piss Poor\" customer service the food isn't half bad.  But frankly to avoid the shitty attitudes and service I'd rather get crappy fast food down the hall.   CSM!  Customer Service Matters!"}
{"text":"Had a 2 hour layover in Charlotte and decided to try something new. Ordered an Old Fashioned, which was good, but overpriced (it is an airport after all) and the barbecue shrimp and grits, which were excellent!  The portion wasn't huge, but it doesn't need to be.  Service was also very good. Would rate this as 5 stars if the drink wasn't $15.50"}
{"text":"Table service in the airport, was quick, burger was good, but Parmesan fries were lacking. Not bad for airport, but there are better places outside the airport."}
{"text":"This apparently took over the space where Chilis Too used to be in the airport.  I sat the bar, and did my normal waiting for my flight....  and decided to catch some lunch.  Great food, a bit on the pricey end but what isn't in the airport.  Very few places show up with raw oysters too, which this place had if that was your poison while you waited for your flight.  They had three TVs up, but it was more like 2 since one was situated behind a support beam which was unfortunate.   This setup could be a bit better for Sunday football season.   Just saying.  They had great beers on tap, and i ordered myself a Shocktop draft.   I also got a roast beef sandwich called the \"Southern Wreck\" which was to die for.  Amazing.  It was like a French dip, but I believe it had way better cheese melted, and some other goodies in it.  Let me put it this way... I didn't want to put it down, and when it was gone, I was wondering if I should order another one just for the hell of it.  Great place and it wraps around the gift shop area.  I'd be curious if they take in enough money to keep the place packed, but it seemed like it was pretty full the entire afternoon I was there while waiting for my my flight back home.   I have to say that if you have some time to kill at Charlotte International?   See if you're able to stop by the 1897."}
{"text":"Good made to order breakfast at an airport. The food was actually pretty impressive and the service was great. Would certainly eat here again when I fly through Charlotte in the future."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 71/100  First of all, love the friendly AND prompt service here! Being a restaurant in a hustlin bustlin airport, those two are definitely the key factors to having a successful restaurant, and keeping customers coming back!  My coworker and I came here at about 3pm, starving cause we haven't had lunch yet. Our laptop was also in need of some juice so we were hoping to get seated near a wall outlet. Knowing it was a reach, we were very pleasantly surprised when the hostess knew exactly where to take us, and found us a table with wall plugs despite the restaurant being almost at full capacity!  We quickly ordered a dirty mac and cheese and some garlic fries. Both items were brought out within 5-10 minutes of us ordering it. Gotta love the quick service here! Although the dirty mac and cheese dish looked decently small, it was very filling and I was barely able to finish! The garlic fries, in my opinion, wasn't as great as how I had imagined it to be based on other Yelp reviews.   My coworker and I are already talking about coming back here next time we leave Charlotte airport. Needless to say we had a good experience!"}
{"text":"Two out of three times I have eaten here they just didn't get it right. Wrote off the first one to opening day jitters, but they have been open for months now. Biscuits are not fresh but frozen the open grill at breakfast reminds me more of a Waffle House, except WF doesn't let your food sit for ten minutes and get cold--I watched one plate sit waiting ten minutes while three servers walked by it repeatedly--c'mon people, fix the basics. The eggs bacon and grits were good, but the bacon was cold. The sourdough toast was grilled and soggy with the taste of old griddle grease. They are trying to be more but sadly they seem to be just another airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a classic southern burger exactly what I wanted very  Good! Cooked perfect . Yummy after a long flight  Jaycee had barbecue shrimp and grits !  I never got to taste !  She ate it  before I could taste it  Spicy between 1-10  she said a 7 . Great service too !"}
{"text":"I've never been here for breakfast before but was pleasantly surprised. The egg white blt omelet was just the right version of feeling healthy and feeling like my heart was happily clogging with some delicious bacon. The staff was nice. Beware that you are in an airport so it is pricier than most. However, when you think of options in the CLT airport, this restaurants feels like one of the best options"}
{"text":"Full bar with a huge selection of beer, some on tap but mostly bottles and cans. They do have local beer.   For food they have some seafood options with oysters. They also have pizza, burgers, and salads. All gourmet  and made with fresh ingredients.   I had the salmon salad, just perfect for a healthy airport dinner. I also had a local beer that was solid, some Nola white.   The staff was nice and worked fast."}
{"text":"Centrally located between the terminals in the central court, a place to sit and be served, hot food. Lost a star Because they only serve breakfast until 10am. I save the 5 stars for places with organic, non-gmo, gluten free options.  I got the roasted veggies, the carrots were over-cooked and the radishes under cooked. I ordered a side of carved beef which was like deli-style sliced roast beef. Nice people work here and they check you out fast if it's time to board."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is super slow and careless. It took forever to get my (delicious) mushroom/spinach pizza and then another 5 minutes to get utensils and, once I was done, another 10 minutes to get the check and another 10 minutes to get them to run my card. If you have a few hours to kill - not a bad place and probably the best food at the airport."}
{"text":"I catch a connecting flight through Charlotte a couple of times a month.  I want to like this place and for some reason keep trying it out thinking  it can't possibly be disappointing every time...but it is. The hostesses and staff act like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat there. I have experienced eye rolls, sighs and outright sneers (as happened when I had the audacity to ask for an extra napkin).  The servers expect a tip but not one of mine bothered to check on me after my food was delivered.  One server slapped my iced tea down on my table and walked away. When I finally flagged her down and asked for sweetener she said words to the effect of \"well, if you think you really need it.\"  20 minutes went by and no sweetener or lunch appeared so I walked out and will not go back."}
{"text":"Good food and good service, which can be a rarity at an airport. I got the Carolina Burger which was cooked perfectly (very tender). This is a very chill place and they also serve pretty good (and large) drinks."}
{"text":"Recommended only if you have a long layover in excess of 2 hours. Service for off to a slow start, being acknowledged by a server after 20 minutes, and water served after waiting 30. Beverages ordered at the same time as water came at the 40 minute mark.  And the place wasn't even full.   Salad, served after 45 min, was fresh and delicious, but a long time coming. The burger and fries, at 60 min, came out COLD. Manager did comp it and bring out a fresh one in 5 minutes. And it was DELICIOUS.   FOX News was the only news station on the TVs. A restaurant should not be so partisan, when there is so much else to put on a TV."}
{"text":"Here is my summary of my visit to 1897 in the Charlotte airport. We were \"greeted\" by a grumpy hostess. Who clearly hated her job and tried to walk as slow as possible to appear to be \"working\"- My table smelled like a dirty rag, so we moved.  We had a lovely waitress who brought us a drink. The drink had what looked like a huge booger in it. Yes, a booger. A huge one. In my drink.  Food was tasty, we had a pesto pasta and a chicken sandwich. The meal was way too overpriced, even for airport food. The one drink, pasta and sandwich was $60 with tax and tip. Yikes.   I strongly recommend the Farms Bar b q place just outside this 1897 location. Much less money, pride in the product and great tasting as well."}
{"text":"Take my money...Take all of it!  The food and drinks here are ABSOLUTELY amazing. Great Mai Tai, Great beer. The Pizza was amazing, as well as the burger. Definitely a good stop when at CLT airport.  We sat in the lounge area which was really comfortable. Not the best for a \"table\" experience, but really good to be able to recharge your batteries, both literally and figuratively. Cesar was our server and he was very efficient. Beer recommendations were perfect.   We were STUFFED.   Definitely will come again.   ps... it aint cheap!"}
{"text":"Funny...people bitching about airport restaurants, prices and service.  Airports are airports...lots of hustle 'n bustle.  I've been in airports and had little time to grab a plastic boxed sandwich between flights and I've been in airports for hours and hours - enough time to drink way too many beers.   It's an A-I-R-P-O-R-T!  Hint, hint...  1897 Market?  Pretty good - better than average in my not-so-humble opinion.  Lots of food selections, drinks galore...all delivered with quick and (somewhat attentive) service.  I made it through security :30 minutes ahead of my traveling companion and was able to sit, order and drain a beer before he arrived.  The waiter made sure I had what I needed quickly and with a smile.  When my associate arrived, menus and brews showed up quickly.    The food was quite decent.  No, it wasn't \"other-worldly,\" but it was good.    Bottom line: 1897 Market is a great AIRPORT spot.  4 stars...I will return next time I'm passing through CLT!"}
{"text":"Best airport pizza I've ever had. Got to see it made and the half bottle of Rioja hit the spot."}
{"text":"The presentation is excellent. The flavors are just average. The chicken Parmesan frittata was decent, and the breakfast pizza was okay. The food tastes under seasoned, so you may want to add a bit more yourself. Maybe they haven't updated their recipes since 1897."}
{"text":"i am writing this from my toilet, where i have been sitting for the last 45 minutes, thinking about the 'charlotte burger' i ate last night at 1897 market. perhaps the meat was rotten, perhaps the pimento cheese had turned, perhaps salmonella was sprinkled onto my parmesan fries. but before you \"Eat, Drink, Explore\" think about how close your seat is to the bathroom on your connecting flight."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to dine if you're hungry & flying through Clt. Relaxing atmosphere & good food!"}
{"text":"I had a 2 hours wait at the airport and decided to make a stop here. This was one of the few places that had seats. The waitress was very nice and helpful! I had a cocktail and it was great. The burger was pretty good and they cooked it as I requested. That said, I asked for non bun and maybe because of that there was a lot of fat."}
{"text":"It is an airport restaurant people!  Multiple visits, a couple reviews here.  Overall, interesting setup.  One side is a sit down bar / restaurant and the other side is a café style line.  The staff has always been outstanding.  On one visit, I sat at bar.  Great service with a great smile.  I went with the shrimp and grits.  Very good and tasty.  The shrimp were large and plump.  The dish has some cheese and some kind of zesty tangy sauce.  I thought it was awesome, my only complaint, it was small.  I could probably eat two or three dishes of it!!!!  Another review has a pic.....  On another visit, I ordered the breakfast pizza.  Hand made, thin crust pizza cooked in a traditional oven.  One over easy egg was in the center of the pizza........ I actually like sitting on the café side, facing the oven.  The cooks were talking to me and having a great time.  I will go back!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot to grab food and chill while waiting for your flight. They have a good breakfast and lunch. Lots of places to charge things. You can sit down and people watch. Lots of food to choose from. Go here and eat people."}
{"text":"The service at this place is rotten. I got sick of watching the bartender talk to somebody else at a mostly empty bar so I grabbed my own menu. That was indicative of how I was treated the rest of my stay. The food was good though, that's why they still got 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"The customer service has really gone down the tubes at this place.  I seem to have bothered the staff by coming here and interrupting their precious texting and Facebook time.  Must be nice to be on the clock and not have to do your job.  I just might apply!!  My latest visit started with me standing at the host stand and watching the girl click away on her phone.  After about 30 seconds I said, \"Good morning.\"  She looked up and said, \"If you want a seat, she [pointing to another girl sitting down, clicking away on her phone] will help you...\" then went back to her phone.  In disgust, the other girl got out of her seat with a loud sigh and said, \"This way...\" without asking how many in my party, greeting me, or anything.  She sauntered to the back of the restaurant, put the menu on a table and walked off without another word.  Great job so far!  Two for two.    As for the server, I have no review.  Waiting 10 minutes for someone to show up is way too long.  No water.  No \"someone will be right with you.\"  No \"your server is having connectivity with her phone and can't update her status.\"  No \"the kitchen is on fire so there will be a wait because your server is also on the Fire Safety Squad.\"  Nothing.    Strike three!    It is a shame because I have been here many times before and enjoyed each meal.    I will not be coming back.  Screw that noise!"}
{"text":"Step into this market with various spaces, exposed brick and open floor plan - you will be transported into a relaxed environment that will allow you to completely forget you are in an airport. There is a bar out front, plenty of tables inside, a number of booths, many high-chair counters with charging stations and even a lounge with plush seating.  The food clearly is an attraction with a raw bar, handmade pizzas and lots of southern favorites, but what prompted this review was their impressive lineup of spirits and craft beer. Local favorites NoDa and Birdsong are available both on tap and in a cooler to-go, plus you can get options from around NC like Duck Rabbit, Foothills, Catawba and Lonerider. Carolina Ale House over at the end of Concourse C may have Carolina Blonde on tap, but this place has a better variety and much more appealing atmosphere.  This place would get plenty of business even if it were not in an airport, so next time you have 30 minutes or more with a layover, make your way to 1897 Market for something delicious."}
{"text":"Convenient, close to terminal B gates, trendy, tasty and fast service... what more do we want during airport rush hour!"}
{"text":"Don't think I've ever had a better burger in an airport, hands down. Neese's Country burger is a combo of brisket angus beef artistically coupled with Neese's sausage. The first bite was mind-blowing. It'd order another one now as I sit here if I had the room in my stomach. Add the flavor of the meat to the pimento and bacon and you have a legit delicious burger. Decent beer selection and well and centrally located in the hub of the airport. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The parmesan fries are reason enough to visit though be warned the burgers are just a little on the greasy side (though delicious).  Also, I guess it's expected for an airport restaurant to be expensive but my cocktail (pisco sour) was almost $20...and the price wasn't listed on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a healthy bite in Charlotte Douglass International Airport. My favorite item is the Spring Salad, which comes with mixed greens, poached shrimp, strawberries, bacon, candied walnuts and a dash of granola. I prefer it with the balsamic vinaigrette. Yes, the price point is high (~$12) but it is not out of the ordinary for an airport. I love that my husband and I can get a low-guilt meal before we head out on whatever adventure we're headed to (which usually involves significant eating).   If you're not into salads, 1987 Market also has freshly made flat breads and sandwiches and a fairly substantial \"grab and go\" section with combos like fruit and cheese plates as well as standards like yogurts, hummus cups, and string cheeses.  The restaurant has both an eat in and a take out area. I have never dined at the bar, but it looks nice, and if the staff is as friendly on the bar side as they are on the to go side, I'm sure it would be a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the Parmesan fries and Dirty Mac and cheese. Fries were good except several were limp and I like mine crispy. Dirty Mac and cheese $9.99 was very good but pasta was very doughy."}
{"text":"Very good service! Had breakfast, it was decent nothing special. It was just eggs, bacon , toast.  Wanted to try their grits , but it was 7:30am so wanted just plan breakfast. If I stop by here again I would definitely try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Never in my wildest dreams would I have envisioned giving 4 stars to a restaurant in an American airport. I have obviously been spoiled by the great options available in foreign airports like Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt to name just a few. Typically, American airports are crowded by fast food action or really mediocre quality full service establishments.  So today, much to my amazement, I was so pleasantly surprised when I dined at 1897.  The best airport food I have had in a very long time.  The Caesar was crispy, chilled and beautifully seasoned with an anchovy based dressing. The croutons were crunchy and crisp.  The chicken wings were uniquely prepared. They had been sauced, I surmise, prior to being cooked. Just sublime. They had a crispness to the bone and I really like that.  I have dinged them for sub-par service.  I could see that the wings sat at the kitchen counter for a while before the server picked them up. The young lady was friendly and charming but you gotta be on top of picking up the orders.  So, a pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"We've flown through Charlotte airport many times. It's refreshing to see they've added a restaurant that doesn't serve cheap bar food or greasy fast food.   The salad I had was very good. Fresh mixed greens, roasted beets, radishes, goat cheese and sliced roast beef. All topped with a honey, vinegar dressing.   My husband had a pizza that was so-so but still better than fast food. Overall, we were pleased and would stop by here on our next lay over."}
{"text":"I had horrible service here. I couldn't even believe how arrogant my server was. When he took my order he was looking around the room. He delivered my food and walked away. One time, while been making his rounds, he walked past my table, gave it a quick \"knock\" with his knuckle and said to himself, \"ok\"- like he was playing duck, duck goose! I was shocked and thought, \"what just happened here?\" I couldn't even get his attention for ketchup or something to drink. When he brought the bill, though, he was so cheerful and thanked me for coming in. I was so annoyed and disappointed. The fries were good, but I wanted ketchup which I never got, along with something to drink. I had the Charlotte burger, which was good. I am glad I wasn't in a rush because the service was very slow. I think I would give four stars for the food and two for my server."}
{"text":"I ran from the end of the E concourse to the end of the B concourse only to discover I missed my flight. Now, what does one do for three hours during prime dinner hours until the next flight departs. I began looking for a place to eat.  Nothing I read about seemed appealing. I left the rocking chairs in the atrium and decided to walk around only to discover 1879 market. I looked at the menu and was surprised that they had actual food choices.  I waited for about five minutes before being seated. It was a large dining area and had a few different seating options.  I ordered the Salmon. The salmon had a nice texture and flavor but had a little to much salt for my liking. Despite the salt part, the presentation and service were the best I have ever seen/received at an airport. I would go here again and try other menu items. This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Back again, dinner after a day of driving and flying. Got in 15 min before closing, they still put a Steak Frites on for me, and subbed broccoli sprouts for the fries!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, an attempt at a complex recipe with poor execution. Heavy flavorless sauces (gravies?) and poor quality products.  Crazy drink prices for unrefined cocktails served over crushed ice! Really? Although limited options at CLT, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"As airport food goes - not too bad.  My wife and I both ordered pizzas that were generally good.  Nothing outstanding, but certainly good for an airport.  I might have even considered giving it 4 stars considering it's so much better than anything else at the airport except for the flies.  The ledge next to our booth was dirty - lots of crumbs everywhere.  And the flies loved it - had at least a couple flying around while we ate - not cool."}
{"text":"This is a drinkers spot and a restaurant within the Charlotte airport.  It is noisy.  The service was very good (thank you Cesar!) and the individual pizza was thin crust and tasty.  I had the mushroom spinach and my husband had the chicken sun dried tomato goat cheese pizza.  No side salads on the menu.  A glass of dry red from the Biltmore was very dry and tasty."}
{"text":"Our waitress was on point (Maribeth) and the food was tasty and quick. I had the turkey and white cheddar omelet and found it to be very good and just the right amount of food. My husband had the grits and found it tasty although a bit sweet for his taste, due to the tomato jam."}
{"text":"Really impressive wood fire pizzas and ready made salads. After returning from a sailing trip around the BVIs, I could not have asked for anything better than the offerings at 1897 Market. The salad was so  crisp and refreshing."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for lunch last week.  Service was very slow and her sandwich arrived almost 10 minutes before my burger.  Burger was very rare and swimming in grease. Had difficulty flagging down server for check.  Chili's did a much better job."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! The employees are super friendly and very knowledgable. This location offers both a dine in area and also a market grab and go area! The food is very good, the beverage (alcohol) choices are great but very pricey if comparing different locations at the airport. It also has a lounge area in the back of the market. If offers a few couches and even more single chairs to just sit back and chill! Very home feeling, which is an awesome thing to have at the airport! Check it out, you won't be sorry! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped for a layover in Charlotte and this is where I chose to grab dinner.  It's right between Terminal A and terminal B, and it was a great choice!!  I had the farmhouse salad with a salmon filet.  The salad was AMAZING!!  The beets were fresh, it had just the right amount of feta on it, and the salmon was delicious!  The service was friendly, albeit a little slow, expecially for an airport.  I had their version of a moscow mule; a tad too heavy on the ginger beer for me, but still good.  Would I go there again?  Absolutely... and you should, too!"}
{"text":"My sister and I walked in and waited for someone take our order,  snooty people. We walked out and took our money else where."}
{"text":"This is an unexpectedly great find, especially for airport food. I came here with my parents, and we all really enjoyed our food. The burger and Parmesan fries were especially delicious! Our server was so sweet and dutifully warned us that the chef undercooks the burgers, so it's best to order medium-well if you want some pink in the meat (weird, right?). Sure enough, the medium-well burger came with a lot of pink in it. Not sure what's up with that... But it was still tasty, so it's all good!"}
{"text":"Went in for a paleo box and kombucha (it's advertised everywhere in the store) and they were all out. Did not look like there was a spot for any of them anywhere in the market to begin with. Store team didn't know when they were supposed to be refilled. Really let down. will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a restaurant so far this year! French Onion Soup, usually a favorite of mine, was watery, thin, and just overall not very good. \"Shrimp and Grits\" was luke warm at best, small non juicy shrimp. Ordered an ice tea that never came, but came on the check :) That was the only time server followed up. STAY AWAY - other in terminal options - don't stop at first like I did, LOL"}
{"text":"What a great find! You forget you're in the airport! They can do gluten free and Paleo substitutions."}
{"text":"By far one of the best airport restaurants in the world.  I travel extensively and 1897 market never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great food, flavors, snack options, and environment with outlets for charging, a couch area, and overall plenty of space and great service."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food or even the water, since I waited over 20 mins while seated and no one ever came over to take an order or say hello ... walked away and went to California Pizza Kitchen  Poor Service !!!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on a layover. I ordered the Carolina Slam and my husband the turkey omelette. My meal had eggs that were hard on the bottom and still raw on the top. Not just the yolk, but the whites. It was also supposed to come with an arugula salad. Didn't get a salad. I would have mentioned it to the waitress but she disappeared after bringing ketchup for my husband. Someone else ran our check.   Maybe this place is better later in the day. But next time I'm in Charlotte I'll stick to Starbucks."}
{"text":"I fly into this airport almost every week and never really stopped here. I have my favorites, but this place was pretty solid for a good hot sandwich. Much more expensive than some of the other places in CLT, but was still good. Service was a little slow - might stop here again on the flight back!"}
{"text":"GREAT place to grab a quick bite and spend some quiet time before heading into town. It is especially handy after an early morning a.k.a Red Eye flight. Hot breakfast and hot drinks of Illy brand coffee and tea is waiting for you. Good choices of Breakfast, and other choices to grab and go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Happy I found this casual restaurant for lunch.  Good food & drink & pleasant atmosphere between flights. Not rushed to turn over tables and friendly wait staff. Nice!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the airport.  Very good service and good food.  I had breakfast here and my eggs/bacon/coffee hit the spot.  Nothing fancy, but much better than the other fast food choices at the airport."}
{"text":"1897 Market. (3.5 stars).  Me: Hi, the sign outside says u have a raw bar here? Hostess: No, we don't, the bar does. This is a sit down restaurant. Me: OK, is the bar part of 1897?? Hostess: Yes, but u can't order raw bar items here. Go over there! *Rolling her eyes at me*  So as I was rudely shooed away from the hostess stand, I was tempted NOT to stop at 1897.  However, I'm glad I don't get terribly bothered by rude service because my order was extremely satisfying.  I wish HNL (Honolulu International Airport) could have food half as decent as 1897 Market!!!!  As I sat at the bar, I noticed that the bar has charging stations. Awesome since my phone was in need of a charge.  I was heading to New England & was ready for the last leg of my flight to be done. I was tired & hungry & definitely craving some oysters!!  As I perused the menu I decided on the following:  -Brava Potatoes -East Coast Oysters  Brava Potatoes - $3.99. (3 stars).  I didn't know exactly what to expect as I read the menu description:  \"Crispy bliss potatoes, smoked paprika aioli, & herbs.\"  I love potatoes so I was excited to try this appetizer.  The potatoes were fried perfectly & seasoned with a sprinkle of seasoned salt. Addicting!  The smoked paprika aioli was tasty & packed full of flavor. The aioli was a bit too heavy on the mayo so I scraped most of the sauce off.  The only thing that I was not prepared for was the caramelized onions. Ack. They were mixed in with the aioli which made some potatoes inedible to me because the potatoes were swimming in onions & mayo.  For the price, this is still an appetizer I would order again. I would ask for the sauce on the side with less mayo & no onions!! Nonetheless a very good snack!  East Coast Oysters - $14.99 for 6 oysters. (4 stars).  I feel that these oysters were extremely fresh & plump.  Considering this is an airport restaurant & bar, I was pleased with the quality of these mollusks.  One thing that I wasn't expecting was the sprinkles of fresh cilantro. While I love cilantro, I felt it took away from the raw oyster flavors since cilantro is quite pungent.  After trying one oyster with the cilantro, I took the cilantro off the rest of my oysters so I could enjoy the oyster's natural briny flavor in all its glory.  These oysters come with cocktail sauce & mignonette but I just slurped them up without any sauce.  Definitely worth the price!!  ---  All in all, I'm happy I didn't let the hostess persuade me to leave.  The bartenders were extremely friendly.  I would come back to try 1897's burgers as my neighbor's burger looked juicy & delicious.  Oh how I wish we could get this kind of food choices at HNL!!!  Great place for a meal & drinks while transiting through CLT (Charlotte-Douglas International Airport)."}
{"text":"CLT layover junkies, unite! In my unintentional quest to eat at every spot at the Charlotte airport, 1897 Market was next on my hit list.   I asked to be seated at a table, rather than a hightop near the bar since I was in the mood for  a more leisurely meal. The hostess led me around and around to a seating area near the marketplace. This place is big!   To eat, I ordered a pizza and Caesar salad. In true airport dining fashion, the food came out quick! I was actually impressed by the quality of the pizza. It was thin, crispy, and had a nice balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings.   The only turnoff was the very end when it took seemingly forever to pay. My waiter was staring at the TV and it was nearly impossible to catch his gaze. Like I said, I wasn't in a huge rush but it got to the point where I almost went across the restaurant just to get him to grab my check. For that reason, I probably wouldn't recommend sitting down if you don't have a good chunk of time to kill.   Frustrations aside, I took a look at the small market setup on the way out which was a redeeming quality of 1897. They have locally made shirts, popcorns, sweets, and other goodies that are a step above what you'll find at other airport shops.   Chances are I'll be back at CLT very soon and would most likely come back. Next time, I'd probably take up the host's offer to sit closer to the bar for hopefully better service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon 1897 market after endlessly searching through the many restaurants at Charlotte International. I looked over their menu and found a few sandwiches that I liked and I decided to stay. I ordered the turkey sandwich, which came with roasted mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, truffle aoili sauce, and  lean turkey all on a cibatta roll. It was a very unique tasting sandwich with the truffle aoili sauce, roasted mushrooms, and the turkey. Everything came together so well and just melted in my mouth. The only  negative was that the sandwich was really small. It left me wanting more, but I couldn't get more because there was no more sandwich left!   I absolutely loved the laid back feel of 1897. Upon walking in what caught my eye was the wall, it had various drawings of sections of the pig, Julia Child's quotes, and the fact that they use real ingredients in their food. The restaurant is filled with various dried nuts, fruits, granola bars, chocolate, cookies, and other snacks to satisfy your appetite! They also have this awesome lounge with comfy and clean chairs and couches where you can chill out, charge your electronics, and take advatage of the free wifi. You can stay as long as you want!  The staff is really friendly and the food is delicious! Definitely will check out 1897 when I return to the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"One star is too many. Waited for 30 minutes. Not particularly busy. Soup came and was Luke warm at best. Had to get salads to go so we could miss our flight. For an airport restaurant service needs to be prompt. Other customers waiting as well a waste of money. Frequent travelers are not worth pissing off"}
{"text":"Been to this location many times.  Really enjoy the food as it is a healthier alternative than regular airport food.    Decided in the Farmhouse salad with chicken on this occasion.  There are many different options to choose from and have not picked a bad one yet.     I have repeated often and will continue to visit when I come through the airport."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to reflect my experience at the 1897 Market bar. Bartender was fantastic and completely in the ball. She was great about making beer recommendations based on my taste, and let me try the beer before committing. I was so happy with her recommendation, and I was pleasantly surprised at the great variety of local Charlotte beers.  I also ordered the Truffle Chicken Sandwich.  VERY tasty. The grilled chicken was cooked perfectly, bread was fresh, but the best part was the aoli sauce on the sandwich. It was so flavorful with truffles and delicious. I splurged for the fries, which were yummy, crispy, and well seasons worth parmesan.  They have a few TVs, so it's a great place to stop and catch a game if you have a long layover!"}
{"text":"What a huge mistake!!  I got a $12 food voucher to use anywhere because of problems with my flight. I was starving, and decided to treat myself to 1897 Market. This place is big and attractive. There are some grab-and-go items, but I decided to get table service. I chose the \"creamy\" pasta with chicken and tomatoes for $18--a very expensive pasta dish.  It was TERRIBLE. Like, comically terrible. There was nothing creamy about it--just oily. No creamy sauce. The chicken tasted....dusty? Like dry and....dusty. I can't think of another way to say it. There were a couple sad pieces of spinach and also sundried tomatoes (I thought the menu said roasted tomatoes, I can't prove it for sure, but sundried tomatoes are not the same).   There were TWO DIFFERENT types of pasta noodles. Like they had clearly just thrown in some leftover pasta from another dish (I figured it out--they were mac n cheese noodles). One of the types of pasta noodles were way overcooked. The entire thing seemed re-heated.  It tasted like something I'd make at home, then think, \"Eh, I guess it's edible.\"  It is criminal to charge $18 for this. If I hadn't used a voucher, I would have sent it back. Heck, I should have sent it back anyway. I was just so hungry.   After eating there, every single place I walked by, I thought, \"I could have used my voucher there. or there. or there. or there....\" anything would have been better than that terrible, overpriced pasta."}
{"text":"1897 Market at Charlotte-Douglas is a full service restaurant and bar that offers a modern twist on southern classics. The ambiance was rustic and country chic. Think long wooden farm tables and iron benches. My husband and I had a 90 minute layover so we had enough time to check this place out. Depending on how much time you have to spend in the airport, you have the option to eat in at their restaurant, eat at the bar, or if you were on the go like us, you can order your food to go.  Since we were eating between lunch and dinner, our linner was just two sides: Dirty Mac and Cheese which consisted of fondue beer cheese, pasta shells, pulled pork bbq shreds, carmelized onions topped with toasted breadcrumbs and their Bravas Potatoes. Their version of Bravas Potatoes is made up of roasted potatoes with paprika aioli, herbs and carmelized onions. Both dishes were absolute knockouts and combined, cost slightly less than a single main dish. We paid around $15ish for both plates to go and those were inhaled just before our plane took off!   They have a raw oyster bar and I got a chance to see a lady shucking fresh oysters right at the bar! You can order oysters by the piece or by the half dozen/dozen. They carry wines, spirits and a variety of beers on tap with a focus on local beers.  The menu is pricey but in a captured market, like an airport, expect to pay more. My take on this is, if your going to expect consumers to pay more for food and drink at the airport, you better deliver quality and a great tasting product. 1897 does just that and I was glad we had the opportunity to visit.  They are located on Concourse B near Gate B1 and there are free charging stations wrapped around the bar perimeter. Definitely worth checking out if you are in CRT."}
{"text":"I didn't have any of the issues stated in other reviews. The staff was wonderful and accommodating and the food was probably some of the best airport food I have ever had. More airports should have this type of place. I will be returning. Adding some soup to the menu would be even better.  Added bonus, there are outlets everywhere.  Yay!"}
{"text":"I tried out 1897 Market on a recent layover at CLT airport.  I was grumpy and just wanted something to eat.  I tried the sushi place, but the line was too long for my 1 hr connection.  Getting increasingly frustrated, I stumbled into 1897 Market and was amazed by its size and great energy.  I was immediately seated and my waitress had my iced tea in under 5 min.  There is also grab and go seating for when it is crowded.  It is like a fully stocked c-store with a restaurant!  My mood suddenly started to lighten up! I tried to be semi healthy and went with the carved turkey cobb.   This was an amazing salad!!!  It was loaded with some of the best turkey I can remember.  The sharp blue cheese, crispy bacon, egg and yummy croutons all mixed into a wonderful combination that was anything but an ordinary salad.  It was a big salad, but the tiny portion of iceberg lettuce reassured me that this was a healthy choice. The large menu contains sandwiches, salads, BBQ, mac and cheese along with some pretty good looking pizzas.   My server was really good!  She kept refills coming on iced tea and had a huge smile.  The whole experience was great from start to finish - I highly recommend 1897 Market!  This is my new go to spot when travelling to Charlotte Airport."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant managed by HMS Host, so, expect the \"normal\" bad service/quality compared to street restaurants.  Regardless, this place is probably one of the best ones around the CLT Airport. It is a greasy spoon for sure but fits the bill if you are looking for a quick meal that is not \"junk\".  I have only had breakfast here but both of the dishes I have ordered: eggs with bacon and the parfait were good. The yogurt wasn't that awesome but wasn't expecting that much anyway."}
{"text":"Charlotte burger was right in point. Not very juicy and not dry at all!  Gayla was a great waitress! lol"}
{"text":"Wish I could have tried the food. As it is I've been sitting at a table for over 35 minutes and no one's even bothered to say \"I'll be right with you.\""}
{"text":"Holy shrimp & grits Batman! That's all I have to say.  A bit pricey but what can you expect, it's an airport!"}
{"text":"Food here is good, especially the salmon salad. Cons: expensive and the metal chairs are horribly uncomfortable; obviously selected for their looks and not function."}
{"text":"Great find in CLT. You don't even feel like you are in an \"airport\" restaurant. Service so much better than most non-airport restaurants. From the hostess who actually smiled when I walked up (how refreshing is that!), to the waitress who was attentive but not obnoxiously so, this restaurant is impressive. You can do sit down or take out. A lovely lounge and bar area. I chose sit down service since my flight was cancelled. So glad I did. Late afternoon Farmhouse Salad with chicken hit the spot along with a delicious cocktail. Salad and chix very fresh with a light dressing. Many interesting offerings. Ask for Chantae- lovely wait person. Hope this place  stays around. Will return on next CLT flight. The only thing missing is desserts, but they are working on that. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a dinner on an Airport layover.  Waited 10 minutes to order.  Then waited an additional 35 minutes for four-cheese pizza and macaroni and cheese with pulled pork - neither had any variation from the menu.  Both were served congealed and cold.  Neither item was even remotely edible.  DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"We stopped in during a layover transfer. We ordered the Charlotte Burger and it was easily one of the best and juiciest burgers we ever had. It was amazing.  We were cutting it a little close on the timing. If we had a little more time, we wouldn't have had to be so rushed.   But definitely stop in for the burgers."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here based on a recommendation of thrillist. wasn't expecting much, but it really disappointed. Out of steak. Out of 4 beers. Pizza was soso. very slow service. and they did not have dessert that was featured on menu."}
{"text":"Very nice place food looks great but the bar service is very slow and they didn't check one at all after I got my order and they aren't busy at the time I came.  I may try again.  But didn't make a good first impression."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food and drinks. Burger was well cooked and tasty. Fries were good but nothing to write home about. Beer selection is pretty good for an airport."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Pretty fast getting in an out. The food ok for an airport. I have had a burger 2 times now and they were ok. The wait staff were attentive and friendly. I will probably stop in again in the future."}
{"text":"While waiting for the flight, we stepped here to have breakfast. I was impressed by the size of the cafe- spacious! The service was fast and friendly but not that attentive. However, the place was busy so the waitresses were busy.  The order came fast and was delicious! I appreciated that they had a white egg omelette option! Good food!  If you are looking for fast and semi-healthy place in the airport, you can step in!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've given 5 stars to an airport restaurant. The spring salmon served over rosted root veggies, is amazing. A pleasant surprise during my layover. Kudos to Jessalee, my server, who handled the busy day like a pro."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for the Charlotte airport. Picked up a nice ham sandwich to go for my flight. But noticed they were cooking up lots of fresh items, and like how they laid out the restaurant with many great options."}
{"text":"2 stars for the decor and service. Both were good. Food and coffee..don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I was in a rush packing. Packed some pasta for the flight but forgot the olive oil. After waiting in line for 10 minutes, I offered right up front to pay for some and they refused to sell me any."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 2x the first was fantastic, service was great, the meal was great. However my review is based on the service on 9/28/17  Our service was very very poor. Melissa was our server she was not engaging, a bit rude and seemed rushed.   My background is in food service and it doesn't matter how busy you are the guest should NEVER feel that tension.   Melissa makes me question my repeat business..."}
{"text":"GOODNESS ME, WHAT A JOY. Today at the Charlotte Airport, me and some pals walked by a restaurant that caught our eye. In bold lettering it was marked \"1897,\" precisely 100 years prior to our birth. Walking past 5 wooden fans mounted on the wall, we found our seats and they felt like home. As Melissa greeted us, we were handed menus with a rustic, elegant feel and we were so excited to explore its contents. After perusing for a few moments, details such as \"succulent beef,\" \"sizzling tang,\" and \"rocky wheat\" really got our tongue bumps a-goin'.  Quite to our surprise, Melissa appeared at our table once more, only to offer me the greatest enhancing dining option: A  F R I E D  E G G.  But don't be fooled, this is not a breakfast establishment. This dippy masterpiece was to be placed atop said \"succulent beef,\" completed with lettuce, white cheddar, onion, and mushroom trappings nestled between the tradition German pretzel... in the form of a bun! I can't emphasize this enough: yummy meal. With each bite I lost a tooth - I guess they couldn't handle the flavor. Chomp chomp chomp, done. I honestly can say, i blacked out during part of my eating process, so I was unsure how the others enjoyed their meals. I inquired about their experiences, and they hooped and hooped about it. This is when Melissa reappeared, and commandeered our devoured food platters. If you ever find yourself wondering through the Queen City airport in search of  something edible, let Melissa hook you up at 1897. Obviously the food is amazing, but the atmosphere complete with salt and pepper shakers so large you could fit your fist inside added a floofy sparkle to my ear-to-ear grin. Remember those fans? They didn't turn, but I sure wish we could have turned around for just one more nibble."}
{"text":"Wife and I were having a bad travel day and got rerouted through Baltimore with a long layover. We got lucky when we had to walk by 1897 Market to find our gate. A calm oasis in a hectic day. Great staff. Nice wine and beer selection. Good food. Wife and I split a Chicken Caesar Salad and a Roasted Mushroom & Spinach pizza. If you have time and want a good meal in the Baltimore airport, head straight for 1897 Markey."}
{"text":"If this place has just a tad more ambience, it would be a five star restaurant for me. However, finding this little gem inside the Charlotte airport was such an awesome thing.  We stopped in thinking it might be a decent place to eat and were so surprised at the quality and creativity of the food we were presented.  I had the BBQ Shrimp and Grits. Folks, it's hard to impress me with grits because I'm from the South and I know what I want in grits. Guess what, this dish had the flavor. It was there! Loved it!   My wife ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta and the French Onion Soup. Boom!!!!! Best choices ever! The soup was probably one of the best French Onion soups we have had. The Chicken Pesto Pasta was delicious. We had a great evening and if it were a touch more romantic, I would give it that last star. But hey, what do you expect out of an airport restaurant.  With that said, check it out!"}
{"text":"Staff is super nice and effective. I enjoyed a delicious local beer and shrimp toast. It was a toasted piece of sourdough with an avocado spread, mound of aruglia, cherry tomatoes, a bit of pickled onion and 3 blackened shrimp..yum! The greens have an amazing dressing...this is my new stop at the Charlotte airport!"}
{"text":"Such promise, such a disappointment. I had an early flight today, so I decided to come into 1897  for breakfast on the recommendation of a friend. It is very appealing visually, and I was hopeful that several months into being open that they would have worked out the kinks other diners have written about. Nope.  My waitress was fine. She had to be flagged down and asked for everything, from more water to ketchup and jam. I can forgive not the best service, but not when the food is so sub par.   I ordered the basic breakfast, scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries and toast.   The plate arrived about 10-15 minutes after ordering - they were busy this morning. The eggs looked and tasted great. However, that is the end of my positive remarks on the food. The bacon was cold. Literally, cold. It felt like it had just been pulled out of the refrigerator. The potatoes were drowning in grease. I didn't touch a single one. The sour dough toast was fine, but it came dry, no jam or butter to be seen. When the plate was dropped, there wasn't a question of \"what else can I get you?\", so I had to wait for a second pass in order to ask for ketchup and jam.   Overall, they simply haven't worked out the kinks - which is such a bummer because they had such promise."}
{"text":"Power at the bar.  Literally...the rest is pretty dull considering all the things they have going for them.  Good music, sports TV, hip decoration, fresh oysters and clams, and some good eats.  However, the staff is not fun or that friendly at the bar.  The Hostesses - all 3 of them - make you feel like you have 'arrived' - which in most cases, you just have!  Pizza was good.  Local beer recommendations were ok.  Sad that they have no BBQ on the menu."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place.  The food is just outstanding - and not only for airport food.  This is a go to spot for me for every meal in CLT.    My only complaint about this place is the lack of flexibility the market offers.  Trying to go \"off menu\" on any level is met with resistance.  For example, I tried to order just a simple side of eggs (they have egg sandwiches, so this should easily be possible) and I was told this isn't possible from the market and I have to go to the restaurant.  Although not a huge deal, it is a bit inconvenient given that it's the same spot.    All in all, though, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really, dahlinks, if one must travel, one must appreciate civilizing influences. 1897 is the epitome: bottles of Excellent Pinot Grigio Vignetti Delle Dolomiti. Ask for a glass, and it will be arrive at your luxurious chair, nestled in a dimly lit man-cave next to conveniently located plugs!  They have thought of everything!!!"}
{"text":"As far as airport restaurants go, I think 1897 Market is pretty solid. The service could use some work though, but I like that you have options to sit down, take away, or pre-made."}
{"text":"Looks good. Doesn't deliver. After waiting an interminable time, my turkey sandwich was delivered. People who arrived after me got their salads before me. So, pass this one by if you only have a fairly brief time for a meal. No Malt vinegar for what look like good fries."}
{"text":"Ok.... decided to stop here during a long layover in Charlotte. The food was really good and my mai tai was a gift from the heavens.  Our server was on point and his recommendations for food and drink were great.  It was a pleasant laidback atmosphere  to recharge your phone,  chat with your travel mate and people watch.  Even chatted with a few follow travelers. Now back to this heaven in a glass drink I had.  This was the best mai tai I ever had.  I did give me a light buzz so it was not missing the alcohol but so good you really didn't taste the alcohol. Hats off to the bartender. Think my husband was trying to get me drunk as he wanted to order me another.  Had to say no because if I did he would have been carrying me and my carry to our flight gate.  They are not scared with the prices but what decent airport restaurant isn't. Hope for another layover in Charlotte thanks  1897 market"}
{"text":"Really nice place,  large, laid out so you have a chance of a little privacy,  great food,  service could be a tad faster, but I think they are figuring out how busy they will be.  turkey sandwich and parmesan fries were excellent.  metal chairs were hard,  i know they are trendy, but really hard."}
{"text":"Nice quality meal while waiting on a connecting flight.  Nice Fresh Onion Soup and Chicken Sandwich.  Great service even though Place was packed.  Also had outlets to charge devices."}
{"text":"Solid food... Chicken Pesto Pizza good! A little crispier.  That was better than oily, drippy cheese before a long flight!    Latoya was very nice and we enjoyed her hosting us!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the food here, especially since it is in an airport! I had the spring salad which included kale, shrimp, strawberries, and nuts and a honey walnut vinaigrette (on the side). I tried the cheese pizza as well which was delicious. We did grab and go for the food and then ate in the middle and they had nice bar top seating with outlets to work on my computer."}
{"text":"I had 3 hrs to kill in the Charlotte airport so I asked the ladies at Brookstone were they'd recommend. After going through a couple places we decided 1897 Market was the place for me.   The menu was small but had a great selection and I settled on the French Onion Soup and a Seared Salmon Salad. If this review was based solely on the food it would be a 5. The soup was great, but the salad was absolutely amazing.   Unfortunately the service was disappointing. After waiting almost 10 mins in a half empty restaurant someone finally stopped to see if I had been help. Thankfully he decided to take care of my order, brought my drink and fairly quickly brought my dinner and promptly disappeared.   I still recommend based on the food, but caution that you not stop unless you have at least an hour."}
{"text":"Came to the deli side.  You order at the counter, then walk across the market to pay.  Come back and sit at the bar.  When your food is ready, they don't bring it to you or tell you it's ready, you just have to keep an eye out.  I had the pizza, it was not that good, tasted like a cardboard box with cheese."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Slow, or maybe No, service.  We were seated quickly, but unfortunately sat for 15 minutes with no server.  Not good in an airport.   Got up and grabbed some a'la carte which was pretty good.  (You can do either here).  Looks like a limited restaurant menu (one page), good drink options, nice hip atmosphere and concept.  Just get the service level and speed up, and you'll have a winner."}
{"text":"First time in a while for a four star airport place. It was early and the place has a nice vibe and a decent selection of breakfast choices on the menu.  I got the Carolina Slam, two sunny side ups over some great cheese grits with bacon slices and a toasty biscuit. It all worked. Cleaned my bowl and added a tad of Tabasco to my dish up front.   Service friendly for early AM. No $15 Bloody Mary since it was Sunday before noon.  Menu does state this dish has runny eggs and you can ask for them to cook them more if desired.   Will visit again if in the airport. Lots of to go items to choose from as well."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food.  Don't typically expect much from an airport restaurant, but food was great.  Got the grilled chicken truffle sandwich.  Subbed roasted veggies (which were beautiful radishes and carrots) and loved the truffle aioli.  A little pricey, but not more than you'd expect from an airport (and actually tasted like real food!) If you have some time to kill and need a meal I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere The service is very gentle, food was really good, salmon salad with very interesting ingredients Good option for airport meals"}
{"text":"The service was good but we got the Dirty Mac & cheese and the first batch they brought out was cold and the crunchy topping was stale. We told the waitress and she brought a fresh one, no questions asked. However the second one, while warm, was still disappointing. The description on the menu said it had pulled pork but we could not find any.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best airport food I've ever ate, and trust me, I've been to plenty of airports! I like places like this that are not the typical fast food mess.  We came for lunch. You can either order from the To-Go deli area or be seated, which is what we opted for. The service during our trip was pretty quick. I ordered the chicken mushroom truffle sandwich (forgot the exact name) and I got really lucky because this sandwich was amazing! My husband ordered the hamburger and found it to be super tasty as well. They both came with parmesan fries which were also pretty good.  If you're stuck at the airport with a long layover, you should definitely skip McDonalds and all the other fast food places and come eat here."}
{"text":"Tom D. Has a review that sums this place up.  Excellent.  Love the food and staff.  Just such a great place with auch high quality everything.  I get to the airport early sometimes just to come here.  Local craft beers too.  Such a great addition the the airport."}
{"text":"Hmmm - the 1897 Market - we've all waiting so long for this place to open and it was worth the wait.  This place is perhaps the best place in the entire airport! Check out the pictures everyone is taking and you will agree it's amazing. Clean - new - great staff - fresh food - decent pricing and a huge variety - they even sell a few items - shop - eat - drink - relax and it seems like it's always close to my gate!  This place is a GREAT new addition to one of MY favorite airports!"}
{"text":"Think I found my new favorite place to eat in between flights while in Charlottle. 1897 Market is in the main concourse between terminals B and C. They offer a small variety of salads, burgers, pizza and larger entrees, with little something for everyone. The food was great. Service was quick and friendly. There are limited take outs available (pizza and salads) around the back. I had the burger and parmesan fries and it was a solid choice. Next time I might have to try the dirty mac and cheese. All in all, a relaxing and pleasant spot to grab a bite in between flights. Absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"I appreciated 1897 Market because, when you're stuck eating at an airport, food options tend to be limited, and are normally insanely repetitive and uncreative in nearly every airport one travels through (think Sbarro pizza, McDonalds, Cinnabon, etc.).  Here at Charlotte airport they do have a handful of more unique and creative food and drink options vs. many other airports, and on my most recent layover here I was happy to find this place, the 1897 Market.  This venue offers several options, everything from a full \"be seated by a hostess and be served\" restaurant experience, to a made to order pizza bar, to another area where they have a display cooler for those who just want to grab a sandwich, salad or other cold foods and drinks to go, or to quickly enjoy here.  They have an interesting seating area for the people who get the \"to go\" items, which is laid out more like a cozy and rustic living room with couches, comfy seating and a large flat screen TV on the wall.  Otherwise, to go customers are banished to a set of high tables with stools (and power connections for laptops, phones and other devices), but \"to go\" customers are reminded that they are not to sit at any of the low tables with chairs, as those are only for customers who are here for full restaurant service.  Prices aren't horrible, I had a rather large and filling cobb salad for $9 and a bottle of Vitamin Water for $4."}
{"text":"Pretty quick airport food and not bad in quality either.  I ordered the salmon salad and a side of brussel spourts. The salad was great, a nice light dinner after a long day of traveling but the brussell spourt was a bit too heavy on the sauce.  The service was quick and I like alot, made it easy to get in get fed and get out and onto the plane."}
{"text":"Positive experience all the way around. Immediately greeted and seated with a smile. Our server Ryan was fantastic! She was friendly, she was efficient, the orders were accurate, and she was available but not hovering too much.  The food was good. The burger was tasty and well prepared and the pretzel bun it was on was fantastic. I had a side salad instead of fries and it too was good and actually a nice size. The wine is a bit pricey but otherwise no complaints! Ryan made the experience awesome!"}
{"text":"First off: service was SO NICE. Over the top, very friendly and we couldn't have been happier.   This is a lovely addition to the CLT airport.   Breakfasts of veggie omelette and the Carolina slam were just what the doctor ordered, and lunch and dinner menus looked even better.   Can't wait to connect through CLT again!"}
{"text":"I had the Charlotte burger with parmesan fries. The meal was pretty tasty and the service was good."}
{"text":"My family and I arrived at the Charlotte airport at like 11pm and we were huuuuungry!! Thankfully this cute marketplace was still open and even though they were getting ready to close, the employees were still so courteous and eager to help me. I loved this place! It was super charming and I wish I could have spent more time there. They had a small area to lounge, while you drink coffee and/or read a book. This was very atypical of those run-of-the-mill airport store, where you just go in to buy a stick of gum and a newspaper. I loved how inviting this place with artisanal offerings and freshly packed food boxes for those that were on the go. If only we got in earlier and had a longer layover, I would have spent more time there. Their menus looked amazing from all the Yelp photos and of course I was left with my mouth watering. Next time at Charleston airport, note to self: visit 1897 Market, order a meal and order a cocktail! I walked away with a snack pack of fruit, cheese and crackers. Luckily it did not cost an arm & a leg and it even filled up the fams."}
{"text":"This is probably the best airport bar in the U.S.  I travel for business 3 weeks a month and this is by far my favorite. Tons of space, charging stations at the bar, an amazing beer list and great food. If you are in CLT for more than 30 minutes you have to stop by."}
{"text":"Great food for an airport   And fast too You can pick up already prepared items or have them make it Fruit ,sandwich,pizza, drinks,coffee,salads Grab and go if you are in a hurry  they are already made and prepackaged  Very comfortable to hangout if you want to sit and stay Clean modern place"}
{"text":"Having a three hour layover, I simply had to have a sit down restaurant. The menu is pricy but has eclectic choices that all sounded pretty good. I got shrimp on toast with brava potatoes. While there were only three shrimp, it was off the appetizer menu, so that's okay. The salad on the shrimp toast was quite fresh and yummy. The potatoes were slightly sauced with something but good as well. I got quick and efficient service. I'll eat here again when time is appropriate."}
{"text":"There is nothing to complain about here! Quick seating, quick and attentive service, and good tasting food.  A good choice to have a layover meal.  I couldn't tell I was in the airport!  The chicken truffle sandwich I had had a tender chicken breast that seamed very fresh. The mushrooms, tomato, cheese were a great compliment to the chicken.  The coffee was phenomenal, like it came from an independent coffee bar."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place to chill at the airport. I'll will go back anytime I fly through CLT."}
{"text":"This is a great stop for CLT airport.  It's a great restaurant period.  The grits were awesome, and the French onion soup well prepared.  Great beer selection and not too expensive.  If you have a long layover, this is a great place to cut through the time."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place! The burgers and pizzas here looked better than any of the other places in the airport. They also have many other entrees that looked good. It is an open kitchen and I could see them making and bringing out the food for others. I ordered the meat lovers pizza and Caesar Salad both of which were great. The atmosphere is friendly, with all of the employees being laid back, seeming like they were having fun and enjoying working here. I love the dynamic and down to earth atmosphere. The food is fresh, local and delicious! This is the place to eat if you are in the Charlotte Airport."}
{"text":"Time to kill in CLT. Service was great. Price point for an airport was about right. I got a nice corner table for good airport people watching. Roasted veggies with goat cheese appetizer was a nice break from airport fast food. I do wish it were hotter, but the flavors were good. I also ordered a Carved Turkey Cobb Salad, it came out in a timely fashion and hit all the right spots. Perhaps not a traditional Cobb, the carved turkey was a delicious protein, blue cheese dressing atop fresh romaine was solid. It wasn't 5 star for me, but I'm a stickler. I'd recommend passers through CLT airport at least give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Well airport food isn't known to be great, but when you leave wishing that you got an old pre wrapped sandwich instead, that is not a positive thing. My wife and I went here for breakfast on a long layover. We both ordered omelettes. My wife described them best saying \"it felt like I was eating a sponge\". Add on some worse than average service and it equals one star. You are better off at literally any other option in the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"I was heading over to eat here but wow! Two hostess standing at the front, just staring at the folks on the concourse with their arms crossed. Being the first ones to greet me, I was surprised at their cool demeanor. Maybe next time CLT... 6/7 at 10:15am in case management wants to do a little coaching"}
{"text":"On a recent layover in Charlotte, popped in this joint for a quick lunch and a couple of drinks. I really wanted to like it based on its cute appearance (restaurant/market) but overall was not that impressed.   Granted I was visiting during the Thanksgiving holiday week so the dining area was quite busy, and I was in no hurry at all, but the service was really, really slow. Also, I ordered the Turkey Cobb salad and it was not good (great presentation, though). There was just no a lot of flavor to the dish, and not all that fresh either. Quite disappointing particularly given the price of the dish (around $14).  I will say I had two Bloody Mary's - pretty spicy - and they were very tasty. That's a positive!  All-in-all, I think if I ever pass through the Charlotte airport again I'll look for another place to grab some nosh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in the CLT airport. By airport standards, it is definitely a five star. By normal restaurant standards, it is a three to four star. This is the best option for a meal in CLT in my opinion."}
{"text":"The sauce of the barbecue shrimp and grits tasted like ketchup and hot sauce with powdered garlic. They made the shrimp taste like cocktail wieners.   Not terrible, but definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Well it was the one place I found that served breakfast. BLT omelet everything but a BLT omelet lol. It had 2 pieces of bacon, less than a handful of diced tomatoes and couple pieces of arugula in top. It was one of the most bland omelets I've had. The fries that came on the side had more flavor than the eggs. For breakfast in the airport I guess it was acceptable."}
{"text":"Layover in Charlotte. Pizza caught my eye because I love pizza.  Had the megameat pizza with pepperoni, bacon bits, and ham. Wow one of the best pizzas I've had, and I know it wasn't due to hunger because I wasn't that hungry. Thin, crisp crust with just enough doughy softness in the middle just after you crunch down. Marinara sauce was not overpowering yet was not lacking in flavor. Bacon bits was spread nicely around so that you got that little bit of bacon crunch with each bite, as opposed to a mouthful of bacon making it a bacon pizza.   Really enjoyed it (see pic). Too bad this place is in an airport otherwise I would come back regularly. Not to mention it took them barely 5 minutes to prep."}
{"text":"Meal was excellent.  We had the Mushroom and Crab pasta for dinner and was happy to see the one portion was enough for 2 people. The pasta was cooked perfectly and you could taste the mushrooms and crab.  We will definitely look for this restaurant in the Dallas area."}
{"text":"Good bolognase. Food is delicious. Miranda is a very friendly server. Service was quick. Good stop to use time in the N.C airport"}
{"text":"This restaurant took the place of Chili's right after you get thru TSA. The food is good and if your looking for a sit-down restaurant out of the hustle and bustle of the airport crowd-this one fits the bill. Do not be in too much of a hurry though, they aren't! I've eaten here twice and that seems to be the norm, not the exception. I had a great grilled veggie omelet and my husband had some of the fluffier pancakes I've seen a while.   Average airport prices rein here and the tables are not so close you can't drag your luggage through them."}
{"text":"My initial impression was not a good one. I walked in and wasn't greeted and when I finally caught someone's eye and let them know I wanted to dine in, they pointed over towards the other side of the room and said I needed to see the hostess stand.   Mmmmkay.  I start making my way over, the place is fairly large, a mish mash of market, quick eats and dining. I saw a server that was standing by what looked like a hostess stand and asked if they had any tables for me. He told me I had to check at the hostess stand. Really? I was one of the seven people in the entire joint besides servers and there was a minimum of twenty empty tables. I'm not even exaggerating. This irked me because I feel like he could've been proactive and sat me but I've never worked in a restaurant so maybe there is some super secret squirrel way of seating people that requires you to go to the host stand first to check in then be seated. I complied and walked over to the hostess stand. She barely said hello and sat me. And guess who helped me? The original server that told me I had to see the hostess to snag one of the twenty open tables. Pfft.  I was finally seated and ordered the Carolina Slam. Loved the sharp white cheddar on the grits-cheesy heaven. The eggs and bacon were perfect and the arugula they topped it with was unexpected but damn good.   But, this review is about the entire experience not just the food. Otherwise, it would've been easy to post a solid 4 stars. The service was pretty mediocre. After ordering, my food was brought over by another server, without asking if I needed condiments, another drink, more napkins....then, I sat there for 25 minutes without being acknowledged. It wasn't that the servers I interacted with were rude or mean, they were just a little clueless or unmotivated. At least that was my vibe. I didn't feel very welcome or that my business was appreciate. Such a bummer because the food was good and the space is pretty cool with A LOT of power outlets. It's like a traveler's dream! But, until they get their service right, I'll won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service, for some. The gentleman next to me and I ordered at the same time. Him a burger, me a chicken sandwich. Let's just say he has eaten his meal and about to pay, and I'm still waiting for my sandwich. Cute place, but terrible service. Luckily I have a 2hr layover. As I was writing this, the server finally gave me a glass of water, 32 minutes later. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best fries I've ever had! I got to sit near the grill and watch the cooks. They were busy the entire time but made every order look sooo good. I had a burger which was delicious.  But the turkey sandwich made my mouth water.... !! I'll get it next time. They bring a whole freshly baked turkey breast pit and cut inch wide slices for the sandwich... And I didn't get to try the French onion soup but it looked incredible. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast in my way out of town. The place is rather large, serves alcohol, has a sit down restaurant and also has to-go snacks. The veggie eggwhite omelette was served with grilled zucchini and squash! Not your typical omelette. Perched on top of the omelette was arugula amd it was accompanied by a nice serving of crispy potatoea.  My only complaint if they used too much butter on the omelette.  I received 3 half pieces of toast  (kinda weird). The tables were set with napkins and only a fork, so I had to ask for a knife...again kinda weird. The server was pleasant."}
{"text":"Hostess was very rude! She forgot my menu and I walked to the front to get one and she threw it at me and rolled her eyes! Then, I waited for over 20 mins and didn't even have a server come near me to ask for a drink order! I still can't get over my interaction with the RUDE hostess!!! I've worked in the restaurant business for years and would never ever treat anyone the way they did! Even when I received a penny as a tip one time!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab some good wholesome food while delayed or waiting for a flight. Excellent (including local!) beer selection and great food. Highly recommend sitting at the chefs table next to the cooks and expediter, seems like all get along, enjoying their work, and putting out great food!"}
{"text":"It's fine for a quick sit down between flights.  Food quality is that of any diner.  Service is quick and efficient.  Better value than one of the fast food joints.  I spend roughly 15 bucks for breakfast and a coffee."}
{"text":"Good food with healthier options than other restaurants in CLT. Only disappointment was the hot water faucet that ran the entire time I sat at the bar. Mentioned it to the bartender and she didn't care. So wasteful."}
{"text":"Nice modern pub type atmosphere with reasonably tasty food.  Interesting selection of beer and cocktails. Their \"American mule\" was way too sour and had little ginger beer in it. But the waitress was kind enough to offer me a different drink. I chose the Jalopeno Kraft beer which wasn't very good. I ordered the Charlotte burger which was juicy and delightful on a perfect bun. It was served with Parmesan fries which Could use some seasoning but they were okay. Great ambiance with TVs to watch sports while you wait for your flight. Enjoyed it but coulda been better."}
{"text":"This is my sons' favorite restaurant at the Charlotte airport. They really enjoy the pizza and the burgers. Their dad agrees it is a great place. In fact, we arrived early today just to eat here. The food is fresh and well prepared. Pizzas and burgers for kids. The boys like it so much they want to know if there are locations outside of airports."}
{"text":"Great stop in the airport for breakfast. The service is quick.  The food is fresh.  I ordered a veggie egg white omelet.  The potatoes were really good as well.  Coffee was strong and better than Starbucks in my opinion.  I would definitely stop there again when traveling."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect so I came in to give 1897 a try. I was served up by the most friendly server Karl. A true professional . Quick to check in on my needs. Great selection of craft beers on tap. Had a few 7.2% Noda brewing-hop, drop N Roll IPA. Wow caught a quick buzz for sure. I had the southern wreck- roast beef, caramelized onion,queen Charlotte Blue Pimento, Dijon aioli served in a fresh baguette. Food was tasty . The highlight was the buzz of course and the great 60's 70's music playing while waiting for my flight . Oh and the food was good too."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I've passed this place up the last couple times through the airport... This place is small enough to see from one end to the other, the dining room, and just about every server in the place....and STILL food comes out cold and any request (from coffee refill to hot sauce) takes forever as you watch your server do other things instead of knocking out your request.. I know this is an airport so expectations shouldn't be high, but a place called fresh market should work harder to live up to the name.."}
{"text":"Wow!  Been in MANY airports, Many of the restaurants and \"wine\" bars...  this is by far the best one in any airport I have been in!   Great menu, fast service, and awesome staff!  If you have an hour to kill, they make you feel WELCOME to relax in the lounge area!!!  Well done!  Thank you Brittany and the team of service professionals!"}
{"text":"Servers were friendly and the food came out quickly. I got the mushroom and spinach omelette. I was disappointed however that it didn't taste all that good to me, it seemed as though it was cooked on a grill along with many other food items and all these flavors weren't working together. Further evidence of this was that I found 2 pieces of bacon in my omelette, in which bacon was not a listed ingredient. I'm vegetarian, but this didn't bug me too much. However, this seemed careless and could be a bigger problem for others."}
{"text":"Didn't start out great! The host gave me a crappy seat like a kid in detention in a mostly empty restaurant. I would have asked to move, but she bolted so fast I had to wait on a server to move me Yelp recommended this place above all others. So, I went for the Charlotte burger with Parmesan fries. I must say neither was exceptional. This place is really about the drop and go. Just like the host, when they brought my tea and then my food not a word. Boom! There ya go and gone."}
{"text":"This place is perfect when you want real food while waiting for flights ,,, the bar at the kitchen prep is entertaining too. Clean ,fast ,friendly service every time !"}
{"text":"Not impressed with their greasy \"angus\" burger not the slow service. Asked for a knife, water and sweet n low and he came back with a spoon sweet and low and the check. Ok for the bar but if want a meal and flight is less than 45 from boarding then might want to pass this one."}
{"text":"1897 is not your traditional airport eatery. If you're looking for a place that serves fresh, relatively healthy food, or if you're looking to pick up a quick healthy snack, 1897 is the place to go.   Had their chunky chicken salad sandwich, which was an interesting combination of flavors that made for one delicious sandwich. Chicken, walnuts, pimento cheese and grapes on a warm ciabatta bun all add up to a flavorful meal that satisfied my hunger quickly.   The staff were all friendly and pleasant, it must be that Carolina charm!   Couldn't pick a better place for an airport meal!"}
{"text":"This place looks like the ideal airport restaurant. But the only good thing about is how it looks.  The staff can't manage to get anything right.  Good luck trying to get a hot bite between flights.  If you stick to the pre packaged meals and snacks, you won't  have to deal with the incompetent and insulting staff."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had.  I'm at the last day of a week long trip and I was sick of the same ole takeout type greasy food and just wanted a really good salad so I got the beet salad here and it was omg delish!!! The salad dressing was a honey walnut vinaigrette and I wanted to lick the plate dry. The only thing I didn't like is they had spiraled raw beets on top but when I mentioned it to the server Trent, who by the way was amazing, he told me the chef was roasting them for me right now. I was shocked they took the effort and time to make them for me when the salad was only $10.  That is what I call Customer Service!!! This place is setting the bar for airport food, it doesn't have to be generic and expensive."}
{"text":"I had a layover at CLT airport and walked by this place so I decided to sit at the bar for a drink, some lunch, and to charge my phone. The bartender up-sold me to a double cocktail, and I ordered the salmon salad. The salad was different, it had actual chunks of trail mix aka granola in it, but it was pretty good, and the salmon itself was delicious! They also had football on so that was good to pass the time. If I was in the area again I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Ordered a protein box and a bottle of Perrier for over $16. Overly priced. The lounge/rest area was nice. But was dirty at one end. I sat there for 2 hours. No one came and cleaned the tables."}
{"text":"I like the food and the place but they just miss the fact that you are in an airport with tight schedule."}
{"text":"UPDATE.   The Food & Beverage Mgr. immediately reached out toys and sincerely apologized!   Class act all the way.  Stated that waitress should have informed me that drinks are \"doubles\".   (She didn't).   In any event this is what makes good companies great.   Awesome management.   They refunded the charge and have proven that some companies actually care. Very Impressive.    I'll be back.         We\"re still trying to shake off the violative feeling we experienced after a lay-over at Charlotte International Airport and are not recommending anyone visit the 1897 Market.    Wife and I were looking for a salad and a quick drink.  We chose the mixed greens salad with Walnut vinegarette dressing and the side of breast of chicken $15.98 per salad....a bit pricey, but the salad was fresh and we wanted healthy.  Wife and I decided on a Bloody Mary- spicy.   Well we had no idea the real spice would be served with our bill!  Our very friendly and capable waiteress Brittney delivered unto us a whopping bill for $64.89 for 2 salads, and 2 bloody Mary's.  Suffice to say we were completely sticker shocked!  Not something we're often accused of being--as we gladly pay for either quality, service or hopefully -- both, and tip handsomely when we encounter such.  When questioned our friendly waitress was left to explain the exorbinate rate for two very nominal drinks as \" the airport sets what we can charge\".  Huh?   Perhaps next time she takes an order for one shot of vodka and some tomatoe juice she should--in the best interest of the consumer, disclose their price of $13.99 !!     This restaurant was nominal at best, and I saw two tables leave in my short time there due to an inattentive wait staff,  Nevertheless, despite my belief that the \"airport\" should cover her tip -- I still tipped her 16% as I'm not content penalizing a young lady for her employer's greed.  I would urge ALL TRAVELERS to avoid the 1897 Market at ALL COSTS.  Save your money this place is a rip off factory.  Understanding prices will be higher in airports is part of the game---gratuitously profiteering is just plain and simple greed and trickery.  The parent company HMS Host ( www.customerservice@hmshost.com) will be hearing from us next!  In the meantime take your business elsewhere   HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Gah! What happened you guys?? You made me have to write my first 1 star!  I came here on Thursday 8/13 for a flight to Boston, and I wanted to take the Lady and have her experience what I experienced when I first came here (it was great, I was SO excited to come back and update to 5 star). We sat at the bar this time, and after sitting down, it took a couple of minutes for anybody to recognize that we were there. The waiter got us two waters, and the food menu.  We had been chatting with a couple next to us who had two sandwiches that looked tasty (one was a turkey sandwich, one a chicken with beets?) and they had highly recommended them. Well, after about 8 minutes of our waiter not giving anybody much attention, our order was finally taken.   Our waters were almost empty, but no water refills for us.   While that was happening, a man came up next to us and ordered a plate of little neck clams, as well as a chicken sandwich. He got his clams, which was a giant bowl of ice, and then four of the tiniest clams I've ever seen (both he and I agreed that we didn't know they could exist that small). He miraculously found the manager, told him about it (the manager was pretty speechless, but didn't really apologize), and got comp'd another plate of clams to make up for the first. These ones were just as small, but at least it was the amount of food he bargained for.  Still no food for us, no water refills for us.  A couple of minutes later, he received his chicken sandwich, which he took one bite of, and then tapped the top bun on the counter... *DINK DINK DINK* it was rock solid. He also said his fries were ice cold.   Still no food, no water refills.  We asked our original waiter if he could see where in the heck our sandwiches were. He went to the back. Didn't see him again.  After about 5 or so minutes of waiting, we got fed up, told the manager everything we'd been through, STILL no water or food, and we left. Miffed that we wasted that much time before our flight on nothingness.  We're lucky that we didn't pay anything; they will not be receiving our service again."}
{"text":"Grabbed a beverage on the way to Boston. Service was great and the Bloody Mary was ON POINT! They used ZingZang mix and dressed it up so I was definitely a fan. The mimosa was generous with the Champagne too! Food looked great but I just didn't have time. Based on some of these reviews I will have to try to some grub on the next trip."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible.  They are way too slow for an airport.  No one at an airport has time for a leisurely meal.  Step up your game or get out."}
{"text":"Was excited for months about this place opening - then I got take out... The egg & cheese sandwich is beyond AWFUL.  Not even edible. I am not sure how a place can screw this up so badly.  Perhaps flattening it into a dried out pancake?  Zero taste."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with our meals here during a 3 hour layover in Charlotte. I ordered the market breakfast with egg whites, toast and bacon and my husband had the pancakes and bacon. I say, with all serious, those pancakes were the best of my life. IDK what they did to them. I can't believe I'm admitting this to everyone. But they were light, flaky, sweet. Just everything. For a simple, no thrills breakfast, this is the place to be at CLT airport. I'm only dropping a star for the coffee."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the airport BY FAR! There are charging ports everywhere! They have a market section with a good selection (only place that sells gatorade). They also have the sit down restaurant section. And surprise surprise its actually restaurant quality, creative, and not overly greasy like everything else in the airport."}
{"text":"The Mahi Mahi is incredible, shrimp and grits is amazing and the cocktails are fabulous! Will be the new pit stop every time I'm in Charlotte which is every month!"}
{"text":"Dang this place is expensive.... I wanted a cocktail, but could not justify 17$... yikes. Regardless, I got the mac and cheese.... it was heaven! So creamy and studded with pork product. Yum. I also got the fries (since so many said it was fabulous)...they really were nothing special. If you go, stick to the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great space horrendous food . We ordered the oysters as an appetizer they  smelt   so bad and old that we  he had to send them back . We had the same problem with the Salmon which also smelt old . If you are stopping by for a drink I'm sure this place is fine but be very careful when ordering seafood ."}
{"text":"Got a pre-made sandwich called \"Italian Job\" which is your standard Italian sub sandwich.  Absolutely nothing special, bread  slightly old, lettuce fully wilted and meat was light on taste.  The price is high for what you get but in line with pre-made so-called gourmet sandwiches you get from the grab and go selection at airport eateries.   At 930 calories, $10 and absolutely no redeeming attributes in terms of palatability, I won't get their sandwiches again."}
{"text":"Had a super long layover, and decided to try it out. Had the sausage, egg, and harvarti and it was fantastic!  Should I ever be back in the Charlotte Airport, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Now open where Chili's used to be, between the A and B concourses in the Charlotte airport, you'll find the 1897 Market. And wow, what a spot. If you had asked me yesterday what was the best food choice in CLT, I'd have said the burger bar in C. Now, I'm not so sure.  1897 has it all. Pizzas made to order in a gas oven. Sandwiches made to order. A large selection of grab-and-go that looks amazingly awesome. There was a container of Queen Charlotte's Pimiento Cheese in there that caught my eye. Mmmmm... tasty!  And to top it all off, a large bar on the atrium side that has local brews on tap! Yep, even the award winning Hop-Drop-And-Roll and my own favorite, the Jalapeno Pale Ale. Jeez, Louise. I might have to arrange more layovers here just to eat!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is much larger than it first appears! I thought the wait would be long for one but it was less than 5 minutes and they kept bringing people in.  The menu is varied as is the drink menu. I needed to catch a flight fairly soon so I perused the menu before sitting down and was ready to immediately place my order.  My water came out first, followed shortly by my wine order (6 or 9 oz pours available), and then my sandwich.  I ordered the Carved Turkey Sandwich on pumpernickel?.  It was served with parmesan fries.  The sandwich was flavorful and served its? nutritional purpose.    The restaurant is also a market. You can pick up snacks, juices, cookies, nuts, something for your upcoming flight.  There was also live music (Thursday evening) rendered by a saxophone player with recorded background music.  He was pretty good (played Alicia Keys and Neyo).  This is a pretty cool place.  I am giving them 4 stars because their prices are definitely airport worthy."}
{"text":"Third time to this restaurant and just had to post a review this time.  Food  is good definitely not great and don't order the shrimp and grits. $20 for 3 shrimp, 4 small pieces of tomato and 8 bites of runny grits with a fork. The description describes andouille sausage as well, there was none.  What a complete waste of money !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not very wild about the lunch I had there--a chicken sandwich basically, that was far too salty and not fresh-tasting. And overpriced. That's a given at an airport but I just wasn't pleased with the meal."}
{"text":"I love the outlets and relaxed,  upscale feel of this airport bar.  Definitely feels like you're someplace else especially in this chaotic airport.  Got a cosmo and it was made perfectly.  Wish I had found this before stopping at the Mexican place in this airport (yuck).  It's lovely here!"}
{"text":"February 12, 2016 Friday - 3:30 PM for late lunch 1 adult  Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Service - 4 stars   Background - Travelling across the country and finally have time to sit down and eat.  Atmosphere - I walked up to the hostess station.  She took me to my table, it looked like a tiny place from the front but she kept winding me through more and more tables.  The only problem is that they give you these metal chairs after sitting on airplane seats.  Please give me more comfortable chair.  Food   Drinks - I had two different local IPA beers, first was a can of Over the Edge and later a 14 ounce draft of Hop Drop 'N Roll.  Excellent choices.    My Main Course - I went with a Charlotte Burger.  I guess I was too hungry, I ate half of it before I knew it.  It was a solid burger but nothing that special.  Service - Speed was a thing here, but I had a two and half layover.  But the beers still seemed to take a long time to come to me.  Future - Sure."}
{"text":"Cheese grits were AWESOME! Best breakfast in CLT airport! The bacon was very good too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We all know great airport eats are few and far between. This place isn't top notch dining and by no means is it the best of airport food, but it's better than most. 1897 Market is huge and there are lots of options like seated dinner, grab and go, and communal tables to pound out some emails while you dine. There's plenty of options to please most adults and kids alike. I had a pizza last time and it was decent. Way better than a Sbarro or something. I requested a place to sit with an outlet to get charged up and it's great to have so many options. I had a couple hours to kill so I leisurely ate my food while getting some work done and charging my phone too."}
{"text":"Unless you like salad the shrimp toast is not what it seems, lots of greens piled up on a single sourdough slice with 3 small shrimp. Terrible  No water when I asked, but the cocktail was fast and  well made  Service was slowww  That pathetic meal took longer than the burgers by two customers order After me!  This is not unusual here as I have been in this circumstance before"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat at CLT. I really don't understand the negativity here, No restaurant will be perfect when located inside an airport, and 1897 is no exception. That being said, there are 3 reasons why 1897 is awesome!  1) Good beer selection - Noda Hop Drop N roll, Zero Dark Thirty IPA, and a few others!  2) Great food - Wife and I split Turkey Sandwich and the chicken Pesto pizza. Both were cooked perfectly and the pizza was extra delicious. The best part? Those delicious parm fries.  3) price - would you rather spend $10 dollars and go to BK or come here and spend $10 dollars to get a hand roasted turkey sandwich? or a pizza? or a number of other things? I know what one I will pick.  1897 is a nice place to spend a layover! Don't let the 3.5 star throw you off."}
{"text":"Connected through Charlotte over the holidays and had a three-hour layover. Places for a decent meal seemed sparse, so after walking around Concourse E, D, and C, I settled on this place for a meal. Had the farmhouse salad and a NoDa IPA. I was completely satisfied. Try to get a seat by the walkway between Concourses B and C so you can watch planes land and take off."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Charlotte airport--hungry for a great burger and a beer--stop by 1897 and try Neese's Country Burger (Angus beef ground with local sausage topped with bacon and a fried egg) It's good!"}
{"text":"20 minutes to get a server to stop for me even though they were serving tables all around.  Another 20 for 1 glass of wine.  The server came back and said, do you still want this wine?  If you are trying to catch a flight and have and hour or less, don't come here!!  Terrible service"}
{"text":"Okay I stopped in for breakfast....at 10:15 on a Sunday. Said they stopped serving breakfast at 10:00.  Sad.  Ordered chicken fingers:  received three giant breasts.  Fried, tough, sad....don't recommend. Breakfast should be served all day in the weekends."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not amazing or not bad although the fries were very good. Unfortunately the service I have received here today was very disappointing. Starting with the hostess, whom did not even greeted us upon approaching nor smiled once while showing us our seats. Although the server was friendly when he was at our table, he did not check to see how we were doing. Our water cups were empty and my boyfriend was trying to get his attention but the server completely ignored us even though our eyes have met. I would've understood if the restaurant was busy but it was pretty slow when we were there. If I ever come back to CLT, I will not come back to this place. I would recommend going to bad daddy's burger in terminal C if you're looking for a non-fast food burgers instead of this place!"}
{"text":"The food was good the service was good. We did have a small problem when we asked for a booth instead of a table. The lady that seated us said to wait by this booth while it was cleaned. The lady that was cleaning it said we could not be there and for us to go back up front. We did not as we was told to stand there.  Lots of traffic through this place but food came as ordered and in a good amount of time. This is not a place I would return as there are more places in the airport to eat."}
