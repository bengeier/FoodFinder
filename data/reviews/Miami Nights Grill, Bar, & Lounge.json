{"text":"Didn't like it. Over priced. Slow service. Couldn't imagine wanting to eat in the middle of a dance club but it was almost empty."}
{"text":"My first visit. Went there at 6:30 on a Friday night. It wasn't too busy.  Service was excellent. Everything was timed perfectly: drinks, appetizer, salad, entr√©e. 

Pros: The appetizer was Calamari and was OK.  I had the CAB Sirloin which could have been a Filet it was so tender and cooked perfectly to my request.  The potatoes (mashers) were Wonderful!  Veggie - eh.

Cons: I ordered a Vodka mixed drink.  When I got the check, was charged $6 for Absolut. I should have gotten well Vodka as I did not specify any particular brand. (unless Absolut is there well vodka???)

The Caesar Salad was Romaine, cucumbers and 3 red onion rings. I don't know what the dressing was.  Strangest Caesar salad I have ever had.

I will return again, but I won't order a Caesar Salad."}
{"text":"Positives
Steaks were cooked as ordered. From medium rare to medium well. No complaints.

Neutral
Shrimp cocktail was good. Weird that sorbet was served on the a side but there was no spoon given to eat it with.
Calamari was cooked well. Lots of peppers.....not many calamari.

Negatives
Reservation for 4:30. Arrive at 4:28 and told have a seat at the bar. I need to get your table ready.
SLOW service. How long should it take to get water? I understand that they had to slice cucumbers, but, really?
Dirty martini was ordered. Some weird lime, vodka concoction with olives was served. It was funny but disgusting.
Lobster bisque. Three tiny pieces of lobster on top of the orange tasteless thin soup.
Seafood Mac and Cheese. This was my meal. Disappointing. No flavor. Several pieces of langostino (taste and texture similar to lobster) and tiny little bay scallops Sprinkled on top of the macaroni and cheese. For $19.00 it would have been nice to have actual bite-sized pieces of seafood throughout the dish. 
Again, the slow service. One waitress for the whole place??? 

Overpriced, slow service."}
{"text":"Had a great time the steak pepper corn was outstanding the wine and the port dessert wine and coffee were awesome"}
{"text":"Pricey.  Got wrong order.  Disappointed because atmosphere is neat and nice place, just too expensive, stingy on the sides."}
{"text":"1) It took FOREVER to get water 
2) ordered a wedge salad got a completely different salad
3) ordered a stake medium rare and got it medium well
   We were in a rush to get to our other event for the evening so we didn't have time to send anything back and we didn't say anything to our server. Our server... he was nice but you know how some people just try too hard that's this guy...otherwise nice place"}
{"text":"Just keep driving.  If you want a steak, go to Outback down the street.  If you want drinks, go to D&B across the street.  If you want seafood, it will be quicker to drive to Rocky River.

Service is non existent and everything took way too long to get to the table and almost everything was cooked incorrectly and totally wrong items delivered to table.  All but excuses from the staff, no results.

What a shame given the investment to remodel this place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and lighting was perfect. However, it doesn't match the service...which was absolutely terrible! I waited 20 min for my check, and 10 to get it back. The food was over priced, and came out cold and wasn't even good. The wine glasses were filthy...Two of them had lipstick all over them. Thankfully the bartender knew how to pour a drink, because it had to be strong for the experience I just witnessed."}
{"text":"Everyone reviewing positive reviews works here...they ironically have only few total reviews but a lengthy one on this crappy joint. Very poor service (took foreverrrr) and very very pricy. This place won't last. Great remodel though!"}
{"text":"We waited over 20 minutes to get 2 drinks, and it  and wasn't that busy. The waitress knew nothing about cocktails or their beer selection. The crowd is older and not what you'd expect for a place trying to be a night club. They turned up the music at 11pm on Saturday. But if you think there is dancing, you're wrong. There is no dance floor, just elevated platforms for drunk girls at bachelorette parties to use. It's overpriced, loud, and not what it promises to be."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend getaway with my boyfriend to westlake and decided to stop here to dance after watching the cavs game at Dave and busters...well they attempted to charge us $10 cover when we could clearly see the space was EMPTY...why would we pay You To come drink at an empty bar? Next we had to wait forever for a server to tell us to get our own menu at the bar...terrible customer service and I've been told the food is lack luster...I won't be back...I'll take my talents to downtown Cleveland for a night out...not worth the extra drive"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant horrible service served us the wrong food and it was cold when it arrived at our table. Waitress didn't know what she was doing forgot to bring us our salads. Was empty on a Saturday night can see why need to train their employees. They didn't even compensate us for anything like a good restaurant would and we were overcharged. A lot of new restaurants opening now in Westlake better get their act together"}
{"text":"Miami Nights has potential but I'd say the biggest issue is their staff.  They were all very nice, I'm just not sure that they have much experience in the restaurant business.  

We went there for a bachelorette party at 7:30pm on a Friday night and there were only a few people there.  There were a couple people at the bar and maybe 2 other small tables.  We had a table of 12 people and between 2 servers and the owners son, possibly the manager, it took like 15 minutes to get a drink and the girl who got the easiest drink, a gin and tonic, it took like 30 minutes.  She finally had to ask again. When the salads came out one person had to ask for theirs because she never got it.  

Everyone seemed to like their dinners.  My mojito was tasty and my dinner, chicken, was very good.

The owner came out a few times and gave us a bunch of appetizers and a few drinks on the house which was very nice of him.  

Overall, everything was great.  My only complaint is the length of time it took to get drinks, meals, our bill, etc.  It just seems like maybe if they got some experienced management or servers everything might come together a little better."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!  

Let's see...where to start?

Worst service I have EVER experienced. Now don't get me wrong, the place is beautiful and when the DJ shows up (if he shows up) the music is great but that's about it.  

When I was seated at a table it took 2 hours for me to get a glass of water and only 1/2 of my table got water. I then asked 3 more times for water and I never received it. Crazy right?  We also had no napkins, silverware, or plates. Needless to say when we got our food we had to eat it with our hands. And don't even think about asking them for anything. It takes 2 hours for them to bring you your drink you ordered if they remember. You will probably need to ask them a few times to remind them and of course they make up these ludicrous reasons why they don't have it. My food was horribly dry and again I had to eat it with my hands!  There was lots of chaos and they were extremely unorganized and rude. 

To make a long story short beautiful place horrible management."}
{"text":"Identity crisis.   Is it a bar. Nightclub or very expensive mediocre restaurant.  The menu is ridiculous.  So over priced but wait.  It's a nightclub?  The music is so loud.  Looks like some guy with money and no experience is dabbling in the business but has no idea or experience. This place is doomed.  Next owner will benefit from the remodel. This is a dream gone wrong. Someone with too much money who is on an acid trip."}
{"text":"We were there for a group event and it was the most awkward night out. Empty restaurant on a Friday night. Drinks weren't good...too sweet with syrup. Starz Ballroom dancers there were creepy and owner just bumped and grinded all night long and not once said hello to our group. I love to dance but it was a creepy dance scene. Place is beautiful but they need some serious help with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a HORRIBLE sense for music. Whenever the DJ actually plays Latin music where people get out on the dance floor.  He immediately changes back to music no one wants to dance to and keeps the dance floor empty!!!  One can't understand if they want to have a popular club, or just be a overpriced bar"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! The service and food were both TERRIBLE!!! Avoid this place at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place drinks could be a little cheaper I like the music too"}
