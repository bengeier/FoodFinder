{"text":"We got take out from here for the first time. The egg rolls and fried rice were perfectly cooked. My wife enjoyed the crab wonton as well as the sweet sour chicken. The curry chicken was also good, but I would have preferred it to be a little spicier.   The bill was a little under 30 bucks, but the size of the entrees made it worthwhile. The do have several lunch specials in the 6 dollar range that I plan to try sometime.  The online app did lead to an error in our order, but the cashier took care of it right away and corrected the bill.  Good little hole in the wall Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant.  So clean and comfortable.  It appears to be family operated, mom and dad in charge.  We have visited several times and they have not disappointed.  The lunch specials are generous, with soup, salad, and spring roll.  The entrees are delicious and make you want to return to try more.  The staff is attentive and makes sure you are happy.  They are in the process of obtaining their liquor license, but I don't see why they need it with food this good."}
{"text":"My last experience was just awful.  The BBQ ribs were inedible and the egg rolls had a sour taste to them.  I have patronized this restaurant numerous times and this is the worse meal ever."}
{"text":"This place was soooo great!  We came in 30 minutes before they were closing and they still treated us like royalty. Great food and great customer service! Even my five-year-old loved it!  We had teriyaki chicken and orange chicken with egg drop soup and noodles and rice. It's going to be our new hang out"}
{"text":"Food was ok...not terrible but not the best I've had...their saving grace is they don't have any competition. And us locals that want grab and go Chinese will hit the \"F\" it button and call in a order...like I said not the best but better than Pei wei..."}
{"text":"I got chicken and veggies friend rice and it was delicious!! Flavor was just right and rice had the charred tasted from the wok. The service was good and portions were generous! Definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple times. Their food is great!! We have been hoping a good Chinese place would open up. Their menu is great. Everything we have ordered has been great, sweet n sour chicken, garlic beef, orange chicken sesame chicken. The special that comes with an egg roll and crab wonton was a nice portion. We will continue to come here as everyone can get something, my mom is a vegetarian and they have great options that taste good!!!"}
{"text":"Owners a joke and my food was mushy and had no flavor. I was eating better food as a POW in Nam."}
{"text":"Yeah... As an Asian person, I did not find the food enjoyable.  They heated my food in a Styrofoam tray, it even burnt some of the Styrofoam off.. And the rice is dry because of it...  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Deliciously delivered. Hot, super fresh!  This is the place for Chinese take out!  On time and actually early delivery.  It will be my go to take out!"}
{"text":"Sorry to give this place 2 stars; it could have earned more stars, but their food preparation doesn't comply if you have special dietary exemptions or needs.  If you're on special medication and/or have dietary restrictions, please inquire as to the additives that's used in all of their food.  Nothing is wrong with their food, it's the additional substance that goes into every dish, even if you order a vegetarian dish."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Missing the wonderful and authentic Chinese food I was able to get in my years in So. CA and my years in Wash, DC,  The Chop Suey was disgusting.  It tasted like overcooked broccoli that has started to turn bitter when it has cooked too long and is a day old.  I asked for \"extra\" shrimp and only received TWO small, tough and overcooked shrimp (tasted held over and recooked) in my entire order.  I was really looking forward to the crunch of fresh bean sprouts like in the photo but what I got was what I am guessing were either canned, soggy bean sprouts or again this was food from a previous day that was not sold and was held over and reheated.  The egg drop soup was okay and so were the crab rangoon but my entree and my husband's pan fried noodles (same complaints) were terrible.  We also asked that the fried rice be made with light oil and light soy sauce (like at Teppan).  What we got was greasy fried rice that was soaked in soy sauce.  No thanks.  We'll keep trying the Chinese restaurants out until we hit pay dirt."}
{"text":"Had quick lunch here today and boy was the food reasonable. I don't think I can remember the last time I had a lunch under $8.50. Maybe in the early 90's.  If you haven't been here, they've got a $5.99 lunch special that lasts until 3:00 PM. With your choice of entree you get rice, a very small salad with ranch dressing, a hot and sour soup, a wonton and an egg roll. The food came out hot, the portions nice enough and the place was clean and nicely decorated.  As far as taste, my kung pao was ok and hubby's beef dish was also ok. It wasn't salty nor bland, it was just a ok and passable. At the end of the day not sure you could ask for more for the kind of prices they're offering."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered via DoorDash one night out of the blue. It was good. Since then we have ordered 4 more times and 3 out of the 4 orders have always been screwed up including last nights. We requested a refund via DoorDash. Got an email today that they are refunding me $2.99! Really?! Keep your $3 obvious they need it more than I do!"}
{"text":"Kudos!  We had lunch at Moon China yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it as usual.  Not only is the food good, but it is very reasonable.  For $5.95 I had a small salad, soup, an egg roll, a wonton, cashew chicken and steamed rice.  You can't beat the price.  But the real reason I'm writing is that my husband thought he had given the waiter a $20 and some singles and he actually gave him two $20's.  The young man was nice enough and honest enough to chase us thru the parking lot and give him back a $20.  You don't see that very often. A big thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible...All the dishes were too sweet though they were supposed to be spicy...The woman who took our order was rude and the service was terrible too. Never ever gonna visit this place again."}
{"text":"I was driving by and seen this place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the House Fried Rice and it was delicious! Good portions and staff is friendly! Great service here. While here I was asked how everything was and you don't see that often in small restaurants. I am coming back!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. We will definitely be making this our go to Chinese restaurant in our neighborhood. Great prices too. We had the Spicy Garlic chicken as recommended by the waitress and she did not steer us wrong."}
{"text":"My first visit since their opening. Lunch special of spicy garlic chicken with brown rice and hot and sour soup. Comes with side salad, egg roll and a wonton. Plenty of food. Soup was so so. Chicken was not SPICY to my taste but did have some hot chili oil which made it better. Service excellent place very clean. Several requests if wanted more iced tea. Do like all the options they give you. Need to try it again."}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with the reviews calling this place, \"the best Chinese food in Chandler\". I guess if you were in a Central American prison ohhh I don't know maybe in Honduras and you had not been fed properly then maybe I could see it. But I don't think that's the case here. I think the case here is this place just plain sucks and when you are in a bad situation like \"breaking bad\" well that's normal I suppose.   Here's what this place is good for:   Disgusting egg rolls. Terrible filling. Frozen?  Rude staff almost tossing your plate on the table.   Pushy staff. I barely sat down and got a menu not even a minute. Lady comes over, \"you ready to order ?\" No I just sat down. She seemed put off like in an eye roll kinda of way. We pressed on and ordered.   The ranch dressing on the salad should be the tip off that this place is a joke. Hell throw some franch dressing which is French and ranch mixed together you hackers in the kitchen. Fail fail fail !   General Tao has same sauce as Kung Pao. The fried rice lacked flavor and was just soaked with soy sauce. Terrible.   Ok so here's the bottom line; this place is cheap for lunch! If you want sub par salad, an entree, crappy frozen egg rolls, fried won ton and soup this is your place! The soup was the only thing that was decent.    To the owner: raise your prices for lunch  to $ 7.99 and increase your quality.   I will never come back to this place. One and done baby! Try it for lunch and you'll save a ton by not trying it for dinner. Trust the Wolf. Wolf tells it like it is. We really ate here."}
{"text":"Everything, even the Fortune Cookies are good here.  (I know, I've never really thought about the quality of my Fortune Cookie before, but they're light & crispy, and just GOOD).  Some standouts that I've tried: (although to be fair, everything is good, see above):   - Fried Rice: fresh, homemade-tasting, with LOTS of whatever protein you pick;  - Honey-seared chicken: fuggetabout that chain place. This stuff is the Real Deal;  - Chicken Wings. Yes, I said it. And I'm from Buffalo.    Best of all, the SERVICE:  friendly, fast, attentive.  Whether we dine in or take out, I've never been unhappy, and I grew up in the restaurant business.  I'm not hard to please, but I notice the little things like genuine hospitality and attention to detail.  And Moon China never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant for awhile. We were so happy to find this location. Food was excellent!  We got ours to go.   My son picked up and we didn't notice till we got home that we were missing a pick fried rice. Before I could even call them, they called me about it!  I love that they reached out about the forgotten dish and called to both apologize and offer me the credit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I ordered here because the reviews were good.   I got three vegetarian dishes for $37, which isn't cheap, and the food wasn't good...  I'm not normally a complainer but I won't be ordering from here again.  Now I know..."}
{"text":"Family owned business. Great food and service. Never disappoints. Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Lots of variety. I liked the egg drop soup a lot actually, which surprised me. Great value since the portions are large."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch takeout of Singapore noodles with chicken.  It was a decent lunch sized portion and price is good at 5.95.  It comes with an eggroll, crab wonton, choice of white or brown rice and the main entree.  The eggroll and crab wonton were very good, however, the Singapore noodles were way too salty.  The flavor was good, however, there was just too much salt.  This is the 2nd review about the Singapore noodles being too salty so I hope they read these reviews and cut down on the sodium."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Moon China Bistro Ocotillo it was the worst I've ever eaten. I ordered teriyaki chicken and I got just plain chicken and rice. It had no flavor and it was cold. I would definitely not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I live close by, so I was waiting for this place to open and hoping it would be great.  Food is ok, a little on the bland side for my taste, free salad was lousy.  Portions are small for the price compared to my usual places.  Pleasant staff.  I'd tag-along if my party was going, but I wouldn't seek it out.  For a frame of reference, my go to Chinese places are Magic Noodle House, Hong Kong Kitchen II and Asian Cafe Express."}
{"text":"Amazing! Clean restaurant, great food and service!  I would say we are definitely foodies and this place was delish!!  Try the Moon China Chicken!  Lot's of fresh veggies, flavorful sauce and lightly crisped chicken!!"}
{"text":"Went to Moon China Bistro last night and we loved it! Spicy Garlic pork was excellent. The place is very nice and modern. Great staff and service. Generous portions and quality cuts of meat in the dishes. Also ordered chow mein and Mongolian pork. All good!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the orange chicken and Moon Special, both with chow mein noodles, and both very not very flavorful.  Neither dish was horrible, but I've definitely had better.  Do yourself a favor and take a 10 minute drive and go to Tott's Asian Diner on Ray Road instead."}
{"text":"We decided to try this Chinese restaurant as we're going to Albertsons anyway next door for a little shopping.  We just happened to notice the sign on the building saying Chinese restaurant and we we're on our way to a difference restaurant that we had eaten at before. I was a little worried by the front of the building as being very plain and uninviting. We were early before 5 and there were only two couples inside. The facility was very clean and looked very nice.  The server was very nice and mindful of our needs. We ordered potstickers for an appetizer and our meal at the same time. It was really nice that when the food started coming,  it didn't land on the table at one time but it came like it was being served a course at a time. It reminded me of when we were in Italy and having a five-course meal and how it was served presenting each course at a time. I don't know if it was just luck that we had just a few people in the restaurant or that's the way they planned it. First came the potstickers. After that she cleared the table and brought the soup that accompanied the dinner. And little did I realize again we got another plate of mixed appetizers after the soup dishes were cleared from the table. Again she was respectful clearing the the last course before bringing the final course. She brought our two dinner plates of food, just amazing. She never let our Ice-T get below half full.  The meal was great I had the Kung Pao triple and I forget what my wife had something hot  and spicy. We didn't finish and I didn't think we would and I had brought a container with us to take home leftovers from what I thought would be the right size for where we were going to go originally. Well I brought too small of a container and had to use one of their styrofoam travel take-homes which I try to avoid now.  It was a Sunday night it was an enjoyable dinner, not only the food but the service the lady provided.  I also noticed several people come in for pickup and a couple of Dash service people picking up take outs for people who didn't want to drive."}
{"text":"Stopped by this new neighborhood Chinese Restaurant for a quick lunch.  It is located in a storefront just South of Albertsons.  The place was new, very clean, and the staff was friendly.  Lots of lunch specials. Ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles with Chicken, which comes with hot n sour soup, small salad, egg roll, crab puff, and brown rice.  Portions were ample with plenty of tender white meat chicken, all for a very reasonable price.  I like to support local, family owned businesses and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"In the lot between McDonald's and Albertson's, just to the right of the Hallmark store.  Food is noticably fresh, though it still comes out pretty quick.  Quite satisfied with the amount of food provided in the lunch specials.  Brown rice is ..nothing to write home about.  Fried rice is good. Eggrolls have a fair amount of cinnamon or nutmeg or something in 'em ..was a bit of a surprise, but quite enoyable.  I like the staff.  One of them always gives me this amused look like \"This fatass ate all of that?  Why am I so surprised?\" (in the nicest way possible)."}
{"text":"Went into Moon China Bistro with very little expectations and they lived up to it, big time.  Ordered some dinner to eat in house and also some take out for my son.  Out of 4 dishes that we ordered, the chow fun was actually edible.  The other 3 dishes, special chow mein, Ma Po Tofu, and broccoli beef were saturated with a dark brown sauce.  I first thought that they were going to taste sickly sweet, but actually there was NO flavor whatsoever.  To get the sauce so dark, one would think that they would have used a lot of soy or oyster sauce, which would have added some flavoring.  Instead, they must have used a bit of corn starch, some water, and a lot of brown food coloring, and thrown that concoction on top of the food.  I added a lot of salt so that it didn't seem that I was eating cardboard.  Chow fun, tolerable.  Anything else, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find this little gem!  My dish was a little under salted, but I prefer that to being served food that is overly salty.  Conveniently, there was a salt shaker within arm's reach and a little sprinkle brought out all the amazing flavors and spice in a perfectly prepared dish of Moon special chicken.  I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The food was very authentic and absolutely delicious! Very flavorful! This place a great value considering the amount of food you get. The service was excellent (e.g. Food was out in less than 10 minutes and we never had to ask for a refill). The atmosphere is vey nice and modern. I highly recommend this hidden gem. We will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"A tastier, and slightly more authentic alternative to the Pei Wei across the street. Small interior space but very clean and well designed. I ordered Cashew Chicken to go which gave a good helping and balance of meat and veggies. The portions are very generous with rice being served in a separate box and the prices are comparable to Pei Wei. They advertise lunch specials for just under $6 which is certainly intriguing and warrants a second visit. Good spot to get Westernized Chinese cuisine without straying too far from South Chandler."}
{"text":"We decided to try this today and we are so pleased we did! It is a new restaurant and very clean and comfortable inside. Clean was the best part. We were immediately greeted and sat. It is a smaller but very cozy interior. I personally didn't like their iced tea but they swapped out for another choice of drink and were great about it. We did their family dinner which is a great value. I had General Tso's chicken, other had Mongolian beef, and a spicy garlic pork. Absolutely delicious! NOT loaded with sodium and had nice smooth and simple spices. I enjoyed it as it was so different and their own. Very appreciative. Service was very friendly and fast. We will absolutely be going back! So glad to have this close to home."}
{"text":"Excellent service and reasonable prices.  The staff is friendly every single time.  The food is very good. All entrees are preceded by a choice of soup. We've tried many different dishes and we all have our favorites.  You really can't go wrong with any of the dishes."}
{"text":"My wife really likes it here but I am not really a fan. Food is pretty average but staff is super friendly and it's always very clean."}
{"text":"Good food fast service and decent price. This is a solid establishment with a good menu with good choices . Take out or dine in I really recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered food thru GrubHub - so we never entered the restaurant.  The delivery was prompt and inexpensive, so that was good, but the food was not.  Honestly Panda Express has better food.  We had the General Tso chicken, Kung Pao chicken and hot and sour soup.  Not one item was good tasting.  We had leftovers that no one ate.  And trust me in this house, Chinese food does not last long. There was nothing wrong with the individual ingredients or anything, just bland tasting . . . .Can't recommend them"}
{"text":"Amazing classic *American* Chinese food. Decided to try out the new Chinese place in town and we could not be more satisfied. The egg roll was crunchy and flaky and full of fresh vegetables. The Ma Po tofu was so flavorful and again full of fresh veggies. Portions are generous and easy to share. Staff is friendly. Location is clean. Menu is extensive and easy to make vegan/vegetarian friendly. This is definitely going to be one of our new go to restaurants."}
{"text":"What a great little hole in the wall! My husband and I came in on a Saturday for a late lunch . We both ordered off the lunch menu which included a small salad, bowl of soup and then the entree . With the entree you get your choice of rice , an egg roll and a won ton . We ordered the black pepper chicken and the chicken lo mein. Both dishes were excellent !!  Both had white meat Chicken which is a always a plus for me ). The rice was excellent , everything was hot and fresh . I can't wait to come back and try other items ."}
{"text":"We are regulars here now. Every meal we have eaten has been excellant, lemon chicken, wow! Sweet and sour chicken, house chow fun noodles and General Tso are all FANTASTIC. Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese food in AZ... The food is amazing, the decor is clean and nice and the staff tries really hard.  The food comes out so quickly and is always fantastic!  I always look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a group of 7 at lunchtime. The luncheon specials include salad, choice of soup,  choice of about 20 entrees with eggroll, crab rangoon, and choice of rice--all for $5.95 to $6.95. My table mates enjoyed their varied orders. I wasn't very hungry and ordered potstickers. I was a bit disappointed that they were fried (but soggy not crispy) rather than steamed. One table mate ordered lettuce wraps, which were generously portioned and a bit sweet."}
{"text":"You should go to Moon China for good Chinese food. The dinning is clean and bright. The food is fresh. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Prefer food to go from this place. Food was on the cold side when I picked it up (10 minutes after ordering). Ended up getting food poisoning! Never will eat here again!"}
{"text":"First time trying Moon China.  I got take out of Crispy honey chicken that includes rice, egg roll and a crab wonton (the eat in menu says it also comes with soup for the same price) and an extra order of crab wontons.  When I pulled everything from the plastic bag there was grease all over everything.  The egg roll was bland and full of grease and the crab wonton were ok but nothing special.  The crispy honey chicken had decent flavor but was dry.  The service I received was fast.  While I was waiting three other people came in for take out,  the first 2 were served quickly but the third woman was treated rudely by the woman at the register.  The man who brought my food from the kitchen ended up helping the third woman.  Overall just mediocre and I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food but the food was served differently. It was OK but I've tasted better. I would eat their again."}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for the first time!  Won Ton soup loaded with chicken shrimp and greens was excellent. Not heavily salted!  Had the Cashew Chicken and brown rice and it was perfect. Veggies were crisp, sauce not overwhelming. A HEALTHY fabulous Chinese meal. Truly. It was enough to serve 2!"}
{"text":"Good lunch specials. Good selection for the family. Great service. My Kung pow had a.little too much sauce. Next time will ask for less sauce and more vegetables. Comes with soup, salad, egg roll and wonton. I like doing take out from this place also."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food here so I'm giving 3 starts because the food might be great but when I walked in for a lunch break I work next door the lady who sat me was extremely rude to me and the place was empty she made me move tables from the one I sat at and then I told her I just wanted egg drop soup for lunch she rolled her eyes and walked into the back. I walked out before she came back out because I was super nice to her and she was so rude to me for no reason. Needless to say I still work next door and I won't ever get lunch there based on their service."}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant while stopping for groceries.  Thought to give it a try (we usually go to Pei Wei for take-out).  Food was EXCELLENT!  Serving size was large (we actually got 2 meals from each selection).  Price was very reasonable!    We have since been back twice for take-out orders.  I order the Cashew Chicken and my wife orders the General Tso's.  We also get an order of egg rolls and potstickers.     This will be our go-to place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, and loved it! The food was good and the people seemed genuinely friendly. And most of the seemed to be regulars who really like the place."}
{"text":"I just ate here at Moon China in Chandler on Alma School Road. This place is the bomb. I had a $5.95 lunch that was out of this world. I am leaving here and I am stuffed. This is a great place to eat and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"STARVE BEFORE YOU EAT HERE. Or, visit Panda Express. Either option is more preferable.  To start, the lack of customer service is glaringly evident when the woman at the front counter blatantly and rudely refused to give my friend a refund for mediocre food.   To start, seeing as though this business DOES NOT have a \"No Refund Policy,\" this woman was totally in the wrong. But, my friend decided to keep the food anyway.   However, she honestly should've just left the food, or thrown it in the garbage because that's how it tasted- LIKE TRASH.   The order consisted of two sweet and sour chicken lunch specials. The chicken was soggy and salty. The crab Rangoon had a burnt after taste. And, the fried rice was stale. Thank goodness the egg roll was the saving grace to this meal- BARELY.  Overall, the food here is underwhelming and tastes old. So, as stated above, STARVE BEFORE YOU EAT HERE. Save your money for an establishment that RESPECTS its customers and VALUES its food."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese restaurant, everything I order is so flavorful and delicious. I'm pretty basic & just get the combo fried rice & crab rangoon. It's so good every time. I have tried other items on the menu and they were also very good. The people who work there are very kind except the older woman who never ever smiles. She's very rude and nasty. I ordered food online, I went in to pick it up and she gave me the wrong order. I wasn't mad about it, I was refunded but she gave no apology or anything. I asked for my order I had placed and she simply told me that I never placed an order. I asked her what she can do to resolve this issue because I received a confirmation notice in my email. She said, \" I already refunded you, goodbye.\" I left and that's when I realized I had mistakenly put my order for delivery instead of pickup. I met up with the delivery guy apologized profusely for my error, he was so kind. And was tipped well. It was my error but the way that elderly woman treated me was so rude."}
{"text":"Brand new and clean.  About a dozen tables.  Friendly staff and food is quickly prepared and brought to table.  Been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Very nice value for the lunch special with salad, egg roll and soup with your choice of a bunch of entrees.  Since entrees are cooked to order (you could hear the wok stirring in the kitchen) food was hot and fresh. Pleased with the portions. For dinner food preparation was the same and while they did have a  number of take out orders going on at the same time, food still came quickly.  We ordered two entrees and they were plenty big for leftovers.  However one thing I ordered was Ma Po tofu, a very spicy Si Chuan dish and there was no spice at all, I have a feeling that the recipes have been westernized to meet our palates.  Not a huge problem since the dish was still tasty and adding chili oil brought it up a notch.  If you really want spicy you should let the server know or adjust afterwards with the chili oil.   I'll make a few more lunch trips and find my favorites and make this a part of my restaurant rotation.  It is not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it is tasty, quick and a nice place to go to."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is slow and rude. Not worth it when there are a dozen other options nearby."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here this evening.  So pleasantly surprised.  Food is fresh and flavorful, service is super and the atmosphere is clean and modern.  Great value and love that Moon China Bistro is so close to home (and open until 9:30pm).  My husband (a Chicago food snob), my 12 year old son & myself came in a little before 9pm.  We started with the Potstickers (6@$5.95) They were chicken & pan fried vs. pork & deep fried.  Normally my husband would wrinkle his nose to chicken potstickers, but they tasted homemade and were so flavorful.  Next we tried the soup.  Love, love, love that they sell it by the cup if you prefer.  We each had a different soup.  Egg drop, hot & sour and wonton.  All delish!  In fact each entree you order came with a cup of soup...nice!  The entrees we ordered were Kung pao chicken @ $8.95, Singapore Rice Noodle w/Shrimp @ $8.25 and Chicken Fried Rice.  All of us really enjoyed every entree we ordered.  Every dish had wonderful subtle flavors and the shrimp/chicken were not overdone.  Nothing was too saucy, salty or greasy.  Really tasted like care was given to developing the flavors and properly cooking each dish.  Can't wait to return to try all the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Door Dash and here are the pros and cons:  PROS Hot and sour soup was very tasty and had lots of tofu/char siu/shrimp  CONS Walnut shrimp - very skimpy on the shrimp...there was more broccoli and cabbage to boost up the dish The crab rangoons - skimpy on the filling, might as well should have just ordered wonton strips for the soup"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and so glad we did!   The service is very friendly and attentive and the food is fantastic!  Be sure to try the sesame chicken.   It's awesome!   Moon China is certainly on our list of restaurants we frequent a lot in this area."}
{"text":"This place is great for takeout or delivery!! Get the Singapore rice noodles! So good!"}
{"text":"Good food. Complimentary egg noodles are soaking in grease. It's noise here too. The one lady there always shouts out to the kitchen and people ordering takeout sit at the tables and it's an awkward stare from these onlookers while you dine in. But it's really great food. Just might be better to ask for delivery."}
{"text":"We had some fair meals, never fantastic but acceptable, in this restaurant in the past. However, yesterday the food, the service and the staff were so bad that we believe there has to be new ownership for such a dramatic change. We ordered won ton soup and spring rolls. The soups was not even close to what we had in the past. One bite into the spring rolls and my husband and myself decided we cannot eat this. Fortunately we never order entrees until we finish an appetizer, so we asked for the check, paid and left. We most certainly will not return."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here a few times, and have always had a positive experience. The staff is friendly, the food comes out in a timely manner, and is notably freshly made. It has grown very popular in its short time.  I've noticed many people come for take out and sometimes have to wait a bit longer, but considering its growing popularity and how busy it gets around dinner time, the wait is understandable, and not too long."}
{"text":"Finally, a Chinese food place that doesn't buy from the same frozen food vendor as 90% of all the others do.  This place has great food! Eggdrop soup was different but great.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! The food was very tasty! The fried rice wasn't quiet what I expected but the portion was filling and you get an egg roll and a Rangoon! I will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Meh... the food looked ok. There were lots of vegetables in our dishes - the rice was fresh, so that was nice. The sauce on the kung pao and garlic chicken almost seemed to be indistinguishable from one another. We were there near closing time and felt rushed out the door before our meal was completed - the server tried to take away our plates several times throughout the meal, as if to say, \"we want to close now - so if we take away your food you'll have to leave.\" Jeez. Everybody likes this place, so maybe if I return I'll be there earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"I've noticed this restaurant when I went shopping for pet's supply next door. Since it has been opened for quite some time, I've decided to give it a try. We were here around 5pm and we were the only customers dining in. It appears that most customers order food to go instead. Prices are reasonable and service was great. Menus are easy to understand. I ordered a Singapore noodles that came with a hot & sour soup. It was a bit too salty for my taste and didn't have a lot of vegetables in it. I saw a big pile of noodles with big pieces of chicken in it. The small bowl of hot & sour soup was tasty. My friend ordered a chef special garlic shrimp with fried rice. It was also just as salty. Thankfully, the oolong tea (only 50 cents). that I ordered help washing down the saltiness off my mouth throughout the meal.   I wouldn't say that it isn't authentic Chinese food, but the seasoning is definitely a bit heavier than what I'm used to. I might come back again to try some other dishes and perhaps I will like other ones better."}
