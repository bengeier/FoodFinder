{"text":"Okay, so I had the pad Thai noodles, which were quite dry and stuck together, and the \"Thousand Islands\" fish.  The fish was disgusting, in a slimy batter with some kind of salad dressing poured on it.  I am not fussy and will normally eat anything but I will not ever be going back to this place.  On top of the awful food, the service was not friendly at all.  It was like they were doing you a favour spooning out that slimy stuff.  Asking for a bit of sauce on the dry noodles got me ignored.  One star is too much for these guys."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai, Mango Chicken and Coconut Shrimp.  Mango Chicken was COLD?!  Mango pieces were turning black?   Pad Thai was just oily red noodles with nothing else in it. Coconut shrimp was overly sweet, but hard to eat more than one.  Sigh.. of all the choices in the food court I selected one of the wrong ones."}
{"text":"They're getting a two for bad customer service. Usually they would start their '$5.99 End of Day' sale around 8:15 pm, same time as the other places in the food court. Around 8:20pm I saw that they didn't have the sign stating that the sale has begun so I asked one of the employees. Now...  If the sale didn't start or was postponed to a later time,  a logical person would of said \"sorry, but we haven't started yet.  Please come back at a later time\".  Instead of that, I got a woman shrieking at me \"I DON'T KNOW! LATER!\" then walked away. Needless to say, I know when my business isn't wanted and I have no problem to comply.    The only reason why I'm even giving it 2 stars is that the food is passable, but there's better places in that food court.    Update: went back and got awful service and my meal was 80% rice.  I'd give them half a star if I could."}
{"text":"How do you give Ruby Thai zero stars with this app?  It is sooo terrible, horrible, no good, a very bad restaurant. I started eating here years ago. It was fine back then.   Then a couple of times the won tons in the noodle soup tasted off. Like it was kept too long but they wouldn't throw it out.   So I stopped going for months. Until today. Switched to the beef with noodle soup instead. Bad mistake.   When you taste food that has too much salt, they are trying to hide the rancid meat. The beef was salty as a Kardashian tweet war.  And the meat is just as rancid.   Please avoid this food poison inducing scam that's not fit for a food license.    And if even one soul avoided eating there because of this review, then you are welcome.  I've saved your soul."}
{"text":"As part of my quest to rate every place in the Eaton Centre , its time for Ruby Thai (otherwise known as the place right when you come off the escalator). I had the General Tao, some noodles and the mixed vegetables. ( only brocoli)"}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible. But it sits in steamers and not cooked right to order so some of the stuff is soggy and also over battered. Too much batter and not enough chicken. Nothing special and there's many more options in the eaton center."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you would go when you have nothing else to eat. I'd like to say you're better off not eating and just continue walking until you run into literally anything else. There's a water fountain just around the corner if you need something to fill your stomach temporarily. It's free.  You have so many other options in the food court. And around Eatons. This place just happens to be right next to one of the escalators near the subway.  You might as well just go to szechuan express located across the room.  If it wasn't for the end-of-day-special and the fact that I haven't yelp'd it, I wouldn't have considered trying it full-price. That said, I haven't had any particularly bad experience with it, and the food was edible and tasted as I expected, and they provide the better disposable chopsticks in a sealed package."}
{"text":"Good lunch time special at $6.99 too bad the food sucked!"}
{"text":"I normally do not write reviews for food court places but this is worthy of my time in hopes that all readers reading this will avoid eating here wasting your time, money and health.  I eat in the food court everyday for work and have had eaten here over 15 times for convenience.  The ladies working here are SO rude, I would sum it up to the rudest people I've met in my life and the food is not good.  Example 1)   They ask me how many items and I reply 3, rice, vegetable and beef.  They rudely correct me saying that's 2 and laugh as if I cannot count.  But since when does rice/noodles do not count as an item because it's certainly not free?  She could have just told me that the rice/noodles doesn't count instead of her rude tone.  Example 2)  The last wonton in my bowl was sour with a spoiled flavor.  Example 3) I told the lady I wanted spicy chicken but she grabs me the spicy shrimps so I correct her and she doesn't even apologize and just dumps the shrimps back and then slams my container on the counter hard.    Many more example experiences but you get the point.   I highly recommend for people to try the other variety places that are there.  Stay away from this place they aren't deserving of your business."}
{"text":"Eaton Center - Urban Eatery - Wonton Noodle Soup with Egg Noodles - $7  This dish was awesome!  The broth was good, made even better by adding a little of the hot sauce provided on the side.  The skinny egg noodles went really well in this dish and the wonton were huge!  There were real shrimps inside and were surprisingly delicious.  Most of the time I'm expecting bland mushed up unidentifiable fillings in these fast food wontons, but not these.  You can clearly see the shrimps inside.  The bok choy was crunchy and fresh.  There were 3 choices in soup base, 2 spicy ones and a non spicy one.  There were also 3 noodle choices, udon, rice and egg.  Ruby Thai also offers a already made Chinese food, which you can view through the glass covered counter.  There were only 2 people ahead of me in line for the soup (this is a separate line on the right side).  The left side is where you go for the Chinese food.  It wasn't a long wait during peak lunch hour.  For beverage, they have the usual soda line up.  In addition to those, they have coconut juice, lychee, and mango for $1.69."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The food was cold, had no flavour and was super dry. I tried it because it was different from everything else I usually get but I am beyond disappointed. In fact I'm forcing myself to finish it right now just so that I don't feel like I wasted a meal. I wish I was over exaggerating."}
{"text":"u did me dirty Ruby Thai.  I gave you a second chance two years later and you got me good.  The general tao chicken looks good--everything looks good here...but everything tastes gross.The taste/texture is too controversial. Constantly pulling jiggly bits outta my mouth saying, \"oh what's THIS now?\" is not my idea of an enjoyable meal. The only seats available at the time were the ones next to the garbage cans. Pause.  Foreshadowing perhaps?  I also had a co-worker eat here with me, and she said, \"this is just nasty.\"  This food was garbage long before we held a fork to our plates. The breaded meats are at a 75:25 bread-meat ratio and that's so rude. I have a pic of the remainder bread bits from the general tao chicken and the hard rice. Yeah, HARD rice. HOW do you mess up rice in 2015?   Bourbon St grill was right there and I was a fool to ignore them. You did me dirty Ruby Thai. Dirty.  Oh, heads up, the coconut shrimp is DISGUSTING. There's also an abundance of breadedness and the coconut milky paste makes everything GOOEY and GROSS.  yuck. You got me effed up Ruby! You don't care tho.  1 star"}
{"text":"The food was not good but not bad either it's very mediocre a bit less quality. You can bet that if you have any complaints or is unsatisfied with the food or may have found some hair strands as I just witnessed a customer complaint. They just nod there head nothing they can do about it. Even with negative reviews this eatery is right is busy downtown mall they cater the masses so what's losing hundred of customers when they have thousands daily. Don't expect anything if you found something that's all I'm saying. I could have had better but was cravings for Chinese food never again for me"}
{"text":"Look at the rest of these reviews, they are all similar.   The food is okay, if you want something quick to eat then go for it.   This was the spot I came to eat when I stopped by Eaton Centre but now no more. After today-- what terrible service, all three of the staff were rude and simply are unaware of how to educate a client with their menu."}
{"text":"Usually when eat here it's during their end of day special.  Recently I tried their grilled squid, sweet and spicy chicken, broccoli and fried rice combo $6.29.  The squid and broccoli were the best part of the meal.  The sweet and spicy chicken was too dry, too much batter and too chewy.  My jaw was tired after finishing half the box.  Food tasted more like fast food Chinese than Thai.  I'd recommend not getting anything battered and steaming this next day to eat.  You can also get two boxes for $11."}
{"text":"Cheap, not great service. Food is pretty good. Good chili string beans, red beef curry, Malaysian chicken, peanut chicken."}
{"text":"0 stars!!!!  DANGER, DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER.  I visited here on Saturday, 31 October around 2pm and ordered their noodles and BBQ chicken, as did my friend.  By Saturday evening BOTH of us had stomach cramps, and this is the only thing we ate all day besides oatmeal for breakfast.  Both of us came down with severe stomach cramps/food poisoning that lasted for DAYS after.  I was having severe cramps 48 hours later!!!  Such a painful, horrible experience.  I only started feeling better by Thursday, some 5 or so days later.  Friend reported this place to public health.  Bad bad place, should be shut down ************  They clearly don't know food hygeine, and or don't wash their hands.  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK."}
{"text":"I got it at $5.99 end of day special, so the value was okay.    The noodle was good.  For the meat, I picked the saucy ones, so none of the meat were dry.  Hope this is a tip for you if you happen to order here.  Oh yeah.  Not authentic Thai.  Not Chinese either."}
{"text":"Of the greasy, gross, sodium packed asian lunch places in the Path, Ruby Thai is probably my favourite of the bunch. Their pad sew noodles are adequately oily, and their pad thai is quite ketchupy. However, they have a pretty good selection of hot, salty foods (seeing a trend here?).  I particularly like their little noodle bar, where you can 'assemble' your own bowl of noodles from three different broths, meats, and other add ins. I tend to like their attached cousin and neighbour, Shanghai 360 a little better though.  A tad pricier than the other Asian lunch options, but good variety and solid fast food."}
{"text":"Tasteless soup, artificial noodles, overcooked Chicken.  Ordered the BBQ pork noodle soup and a combo. Just overall poor quality food.  Good quantity but not worth the price"}
{"text":"My friend got food from there and found cooked pieces of some plastic wrapper mixed in the food, and a dead bug with weird legs in one of the spring rolls. (I WOULDNT WANNA EAT ROLLS WRAPPED WITH BUGS) The first time it was only the plastic wrapper so they gave my friend the same thing but \"new\"... Then we found that there was the bug the second time so it wasn't gonna cut it. They gave my friend a refund.   Worst customer service as well.. I came and asked for 6 PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS.. and the lady kept telling me to go on the opposite side so I did and then I told a different lady and she told me to go back and this happened like 4 times where I had to walk back and forth cause they didn't friggen understand english.   I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The Szechuan place at urban eatery is way better.   Im not saying every time you'll find something in your food but one time is enough.   Pay attention to where you eat, and what you eat. Id be careful eating at Ruby Thai. I think public health needs to pay them a visit.  That's all. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of the two Thai food court places in urban eater at the Eaton Centre. Located near Sports Chek, one of the first place you see as you come down the escalator, there is surprisingly no line, unlike Thai Express down on the other end. Alas, there is a very good reason.  My mom and I ordered the three item+ rice or noodle for 8.99, and wonton soup noodle for 6.95--both of which were horrible.  The pad thai is tasteless and overcooked. The panang curry beef was good, but the bang bang chicken was not, and this unamed seafood dish was just plain gross.  The shrimp wontons are giant, but a huge part of the inside is actually shrimp paste rather than real shrimp, and the flavour is bland. The broth itself was alright.  The worst part is probably the ppl working there. A bunch of women who are too busy chatting and laughing (at least they're enjoying their job) and its really irritating to order one item, wait for them to finish a conversation, order the second item, wait again. Considering how busy the mall was and already the small number of ppl at their place, I guess it's only fair that they've already given up."}
