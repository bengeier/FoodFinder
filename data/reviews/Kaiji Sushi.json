{"text":"Wow! I usually never write reviews but I simply had to. I ordered sushi yesterday night since I had a coupon from City Linked. Honestly, this is the best sushi place I have found in Montreal so far, and trust me I have been to many. This place is really inexpensive and the sushi is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant and it will be from now on my go to restaurant for sushi cravings!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING SUSHI!
The food is so amazing here that I drive all the way from Toronto! Hands down, there is no comparison with Toronto Sushi Restaurants as Kaiji has the freshest seafood and ingredients.

Keep in mind this is an express/take-out style restaurant so it is a smaller space and the decor is not fancy dancy, but you're definitely getting the quality in the food of a high end expensive restaurant. That also means the prices are very fair.

I've been here numerous times. Chef Phong has an amazing talent for balanced flavours and sauces that pair perfectly with his sushi.

Some of my favourite dishes:
Beef sashimi _ best sashimi I've ever had
Rainbow Roll - OMG!
Volcano Roll
Uni Sushi - was never a fan of Uni before, but it's a different story when as fresh as Kaiji's
Sushi Pizza
Kaiji Salad
Fueilles de Tartare

Definitely my go-to for sushi any and EVERYTIME I'm in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I both agreed to meet in Montréal to spend some time exploring the city. We found a Groupon online for Kaiji. Both of us being world travelled and avid lovers of food, the groupon being a great deal and the menu looked great, we sought it as a new adventure.

We were not disappointed. As we are staying in a downtown hotel, we required to plan our transit journey as the restaurant seemed to be a bit out of the downtown area. Walking from the subway to the restaurant, we were a bit unsure. The neighbourhood seemed relatively quiet and uneventful.

Arriving at the restaurant, we were immediately pleased with the decor, the settings, the volume and any initial doubts were soothed. The staff greeted us pleasantly and we started out menu selections.

The food was prepared very well and served at a great pace. The rich blends of flavours, combined with an amazing display met for our delight. Having lived in Vancouver, BC for sometime now, we were extremely delighted to find this sushi restaurant and with the menu.

One thing to note is, it is BYO Bottle and we forgot this. So, if you choose to come hear, BYO Bottle. ;) 

Highly Recommend, Worth the Effort."}
{"text":"This sushi place is located way out of our usual radius since we live downtown, but I'm glad we went! What really sets this place apart from other sushi restos in the city is the attention to detail and the distinct sauces that come with the various rolls. One roll had a nice and unexpectedly tangy vinegary sauce, another had a mustard-based sauce and yet another roll had a sweeter one. Unlike a lot of other sushi places, many of the rolls vary in ingredients, so you don't feel like you're just ordering the same roll several times. The fish tasted fresh, probably one of the top \"fresh\" tasting places I've been to in Montreal.The service was friendly, and clearly the owners care about their product. The interior was cute, red walls and buddhas around. They also do more than just sushi and have bento boxes/cooked stiry-fry meals, etc. I actually much preferred the quality of the food and the setting to Saint Sushi, which seems to be all the rave right now. To top it off, it's a BYOW. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Une première fois, j'ai voulu aller manger chez Kaiji Sushi, c'était un samedi et c'était déjà full.
Pas grave, la semaine passée j'ai appelé à 17h30 un vendredi pour une table pour 2. La table est réservée, on arrive à 19h30. Il y a déjà quelques tables occupées. Le restaurant n'est pas très grand, une trentaine de sièges peut être.
On passe commande, la carte est alléchante. Un premier sushi roll nous est servi 20 minutes après notre commande. C'est tellement fin et bon !
Puis 10-15 minutes après, le reste de notre commande nous est servi. C'est vraiment très bon ! 
On est ravis de la qualité, on trouve juste que c'est un peu cher. Certains spécials rolls sont à 16$ quand même !
Les serveurs sont vraiment gentils, on aurait juste aimé être servi tout en même temps pour choisir ce qu'on mange à quel moment, mais c'est presque un détail !
Bonne adresse sushi, on y reviendra pour sûr !"}
{"text":"Service incroyable dans ce petit resto qui vous surprendra plus que vous ne le pensez. Les sushis sont différents et succulents."}
