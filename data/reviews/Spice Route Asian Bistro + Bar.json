{"text":"Food was great although just a bit expensive. The service was not stellar. I was alone due to travel but it would have been nice to have had someone clear the plates once an hour...still, I figured this was a fluke and just a Wednesday"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. And unduly pretentious. Went there as part of a large group of 20 for a corporate dinner. Despite telling the wait staff (twice!) that I was vegetarian, and being assured that we'd get plenty of vegetarian options, they brought out ONE starter that was vegetarian (out of a total of nearly 40 plates of food).  I'm sorry - no matter how good the food is (and it wasn't), being unresponsive to a request as basic as this is atrocious - and we probably spent nearly $200 per person there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere... business types of a wide age range...from 20-50.  There is some sleaziness (as with any after-work watering hole.. )  But overall, this place has been around long enough to eliminate the newbies.    Always busy, but never too crowded.  The patio is great in the summer.  Easy to walk in at any time of evening.  The bathrooms are gorgeous.  The decor is over the top...dark and dramatic...but that's what makes it great! My main complaint was the service on the phone.  I was making reservations for a bachelorette dinner.  (Classy crowd, not cheesy).  They were downright rude.  We had to leave a credit card just to be seated.  They wouldn't accept a reservation for more than 12 people, etc. etc.   You would think they would work harder to accomodate a group of gorgeous late 20 somethings?? I don't know why people are saying the food is expensive... it's not! The food is average, but you don't come here for the food...obviously.  This is a bar that serves food... have a few drinks and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This used to be one of my favourite places to go for both food and a casual drink. Not after last night. We had a $100 gift certificate so we made reservations for a rare night out. They seated us right beside the patio door which kept opening for smokers, so it was pretty chill and not in a good way. Of course there were several open tables but there were only 2 of us so I guess they were saving the larger tables for all the others who were planning to come in at 10:30pm for dinner.  Took 15 mins for our server to acknowledge us. She was actually quite nice but was serving a ridiculously large section. No one provided us with water--no food runners here or what? I asked about vegan options and a manager came over to give me the rundown. I ordered what he suggested with thanks. Then our server came back to verify our order saying that the only thing the 'chef' could do was to steam any vegetables but that 'would be very plain'. I asked if he could at least put soy sauce or something and she said no. Seriously? A 'chef' who doesn't know what to do with vegetables other than to basically boil them?   Needless to say, we left. And we won't be back."}
{"text":"Now, my view on Spice Route might be skewed because I happened to be there while being slightly pampered.  You see, myself and my girlfriend went to check it out because her company was going to potentially hold an event there.  So read my review with the consideration that we had to make sure 180 people would be satisfied spending an entire evening in the joint.  Having read some of the above reviews, I would have to agree that service does appear to lack - it seems as though they have tons of servers but not enough people serving.  That's just an observation of other tables, we were served quite well.  One of the things that really stood out to me was that conversation does not travel.  Despite the tables being relatively close together, the conversations happening elsewhere don't drift and noise from the other tables doesn't interrupt, so you can focus on the person across from you.  I don't think their food is mind blowing, but it is good.  The lamb was delicious both times I had it and the chicken and duck lettuce wraps, with the wasabi mustard is absolutely fantastic and definitely the appetizer you should choose.  Oh man, and the cheesecake lollipop...is just awesome. Its different than any other cheesecake I've had, and easily the best I've ever tasted. I would say that desert alone bumped this place from a 3 to a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I personally would like to thank you Shane manager and your staff for the great service and hospitality yesterday. My friend and I had a great time as we were celebrating her birthday. The service and food was excellent. I worked for many years in the restaurant business and there is nothing better then going out and feeling \"at home\" in a restaurant.  Thank you very much,  A happy customer, Marise Ciardullo"}
{"text":"Went there on a breezy sunday night, which was really nice to sit at their patio. The patio-lounge area was nicely decorated with wooden floors, cushioned sofas&torch, making the space villa-like. On sundays, they offer all-you-can-eat menu, but the food was half cold when they arrived..but will go back again with friends for drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"Amazing venue. Decent bar crowd on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is presented well and better than your average Chinese food. Service is genuine and more than usually on top of things. Recommend volcano rolls!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere was great but the food was horrible! I got food poisoning the next day from having to cook our own meat on the hot stone they provided us with, I'll go there again but will definitely only be having drinks"}
{"text":"Not usually one to complain...I have been to SR 3 times now. First time was great, 2nd and 3rd...pretty bad.  Went with a big group the last time and the service was brutal. We waited a good 20 minutes to get our drinks and the waiter rarely came by. The food comes as soon as it's ready, but half the table was done their food before the others even got theirs.   I love the decor and the ambiance is awesome - just wish the service was more consistent."}
{"text":"Seems to have steadily gone down hill. This used  to be one of my favourite restaurants. I went last night and the restaurant was almost as cold as outside and very difficult to enjoy. Everyone had their winter jackets and gloves on. The food was mediocre."}
{"text":"The private bathrooms are something different. That said:  - the food is extremely boring and average. for the price tag, i'll go one step down and say what i got was hyped up crap.  - how do they hire the wait staff, based on how pretentious they are...?  - I thought pravda on front st. was the worst high end venue up to date that doesn't measure up to a quarter of what they charge compared to what they give back to you... ok now i've been proven wrong. Spice route wins"}
{"text":"Worst 'Lounge'  in Toronto by far. They act like they think they are the viper room, but serve chinese food that you would find at mandarin: not to mention disgusting, disgusting service. The Manager Kevin is easily the worst examples of management I have ever seen. A night that was booked with a Julie with 10 of our guests, had us waiting for an hour and a half at the door with no seat suggestions given after asking about 10 different times. Finally when one of our party members went to speak to management about the ridiculousness of the situation, he shouted at her and asked her to be kicked out. Yes...he asked us to be kicked out. The security guard Howard stepped in to try to calm the situation down as he could see Kevin be extremely unreasonable. We wrote to Liberty group after and complained about our treatment, not even a call back."}
{"text":"I had very low expectations after hearing and reading about the horrible service many people have experienced here. To my surprise our group of eleven had food and drink orders taken care of promptly. Everything came out of the bar and kitchen in no time at all. Friends who arrived late were also greeted with the same speedy service. Empty platters were quickly removed from our crowded table and my wine glass was never empty. I was surprisingly impressed.  I wasn't impressed however with the food, which I found to be lusterless and extremely overpriced. I could have had the exact same meal at a fraction of the cost somewhere else. I definitely wouldn't recommend coming here for the food, but I would recommend coming here to enjoy a drink. The venue is beautiful from inside to out with the high ceilings and asian accents. The terrace was a great place to unwind after our meal among the koi pond and fire to keep warm. While you're here don't forget to stop by the washrooms!"}
{"text":"Poor food and far from exceptional service.  Great big booth that's good for large groups, but the plates they use are very long rectangles, so it's actually difficult to eat your meal."}
{"text":"Food was very good,  portions could have been a little bigger though.  Service was horrendous, the waiter David should consider changing careers. He was horrible, did not come to the table often at all, especially in the beginning left us waiting for a long time. Was also very rude.   Payment system is either really odd, or David did not want to do the work.  You only get ONE bill, and then the customer has to go through the items, do the math, and figure out how much each person should pay, rather than  get separate  bills like every restaurant in North America."}
{"text":"Excellent indo-Chine cuisine served up with attentive service amid an exotic setting. The whole red snapper was a winner in my book. Stay on after dinner and people watch as the crowd eases from dinner into lounging... and posing ;)"}
{"text":"Overall just an okay experience. Arrived here shortly after 7 to find it almost completely empty. It's very dimly lit and has a lounge-y atmosphere. By the time we had left at around 8:30, it really filled up (guess all the cool people eat late!)  Anyways, the server brought us complimentary bread - two small pieces of deep-fried bread served with a banana chutney (aka mushed up bananas). I really enjoyed the bread, but the chutney was meh.  We started with the Spiced chicken + Peking duck lettuce wraps - served with brandied hoisin sauce ($12). Obviously not very authentic, but they tasted ok... but certainly on the greasy side. After we finished them there was a large pool of oil at the bottom.  Next, came the spicy stir fried eggplant ($7) which was a side dish. I didn't like that it didn't come at the same time as our fish. We had finished this dish before our main even came. Anyways, the menu advertised that this was served in a chili pepper sauce. However, it was not spicy, nor was it served in a chili pepper sauce. It was actually served in a black bean sauce. Again, just an ok dish.  Our main was the Whole red snapper -served with julienne ginger + scallions + sizzling hot oil ($22). It was a pretty big piece of fish which was certainly enough for the two of us (we were thinking of ordering another meat dish, but luckily we didn't!). It was a tad dry... but overall another ok dish. Be warned though, this isn't a very good first-date dish (there are a lot of bones in the fish... you'll spend a lot of time picking them out of your mouth!)  The best dish of the night was our dessert - the banana tempura ($6). It came with 5 timbit sized pieces and was served with vanilla ice cream. Yum!  Overall - just a \"meh\" experience. A cool place to grab a drink, but very forgettable food."}
{"text":"Was here to celebrate an anniversary so was very psyched to try out this place with my partner. Placed a reservation in advance to make sure we had a spot - heard that it was often crowded. Had rather high expectations for the place and therefore was extremely peeved by how impolite the girl at the front of the restaurant treated us. She was on the phone when we first entered so I waited for her to end her call before saying anything but before I even finished my sentence, she cut me off by picking up another call, as though I was invisible. It set an extremely unpleasant note for my evening and she did not apologise nor attempt to improve her attitude. Could not even get my name right. You would think a restaurant would have the sense to pick someone pleasant as the first face their customers see when they enter. Really liked their Peking duck dish but it went cold really fast which was a pity. The Indian roast chicken was so-so and same goes for their dessert which I was most excited by from the menu. Overall, the only two things that stood out from my experience was the Peking duck and how professional and attentive our server Sean/Shawn is. Will seriously reconsider before revisiting this establishment."}
{"text":"Dined here on Saturday night with a group of friends for Summerlicious - Great Menu selection - great service - great price point. Very highly recommend.        MY Previous Reviews 4.0 star rating1/30/2013 Edit \" Came by last week for dinner with my boyfriend on our Anniversary. I had made a note when making the reservation that it was a special night and would it be possible to have a nice table.  This request seemed to go un noticed as when we arrived the restaurant was almost empty but we were put on the banquette in between the only other 2 table seated.  The Banquette tables are quite close together. I almost felt part of the next couples conversation. I think the host / floor plan maker should take this into consideration when sitting guests in future.  Our server was great. Very attentive and ready to answer any questions we had.  We started off with the spring rolls to share... It really wasn't a sharing size.. it was 3 small spring rolls cut in half.. But they did taste good! We then had the Duck Pancakes.. Again it was a small sharing portion.. It too was really good.. the duck was moist and the skin was really crispy. We then had the Mongolian Beef and sticky rice.. Wow! It was super spicy and really good! We had a look at the dessert menu but there was nothing that caught our eye so we said that we'd just go down the street for a cocktail..  We will most defo return here soon. Good Job"}
{"text":"Best way to start of my review is by saying this place is just over-rated for nothing................  So finally dragged myself and two of my girlfriends to go and check out what the hype was all about at this restaurant. We arrived very early so there was no Bouncer or Line-Up at the door and we were immediately seated I guess since we had reservations. Our table was near the bar (if ONLY we had KNOWN that elbows, butts and bellies would be bumping into us every 30 seconds we would have asked to be moved to a different table)  Place filled up very quickly with all these pretencious wanna be \"fashionista's blah, blah, blah.   Nevertheless we were STUCK with the most annoying waitress in the industry..............she rushed us through our dinner that at ONE point I just wanted to say \"back off B****) we are trying to enjoy ourselves.  We shared the Mangolian Beef, & Prawns in a clay pot Mangolian Beef was nothing special Prawns were just there the only excitement was the Clay Pot we all wondered where we could go and buy one for our kitchens. Lychee Martini's were watered down........................NEVER ORDER A MARTINI HERE Malbec, Argentina $12 per glass was very tasty  By the way there is actually one nice thing about this place before I forget and that is the AMBIANCE the designers did a FABULOUS job.   Next time I'm on King West looking for a place to go for dinner I WILL NOT GO TO SPICE ROUTE."}
{"text":"I've been to spice route a few times and always love it !! Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! Always happy with what I order, the sushi and dim sum platter are my favourites! Their patio is beautiful! Great place for summer dinner and drinks !"}
{"text":"For a higher end restaurant in Toronto.  This place is very disappointing.  Crab cake were overly salty and made out of shrimp.  Calamari salad has a handful of unsalted chopped up Calamari. Pad Thai was drenched with tamarind sauce that it was way too sour to enjoy.   Food came on plates that were banged up,  you start to wonder how they can run a restaurant like this.  Better off going to Chinatown up the street."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food isn't really authentic and abit bland for Asian fusion"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Spice Route was for my company's Christmas Luncheon this past year, and we we're quite impressed with the surroundings (it starts right on the curb with the tiki-torches leading down a covered lane to the oversized wooden entrance, then the huge internal space with numerous skylights and stylized decorative touches like 12-foot tall paintings of Buddha on the walls, etc.).  The food was decent, and as another reviewer mentioned, the washrooms are utterly spectacular - each private cubicle features a floor-to-ceiling glass wall looking out on an enclosed zen garden (it takes a minute to realize that it's fully enclosed, and there's no danger of anybody strolling by unexpectedly, but it's still a little odd shucking your pants inches from a floor-to-ceiling window...).  Despite the obvious input from an excellent interior designer, though, the overall experience was a little disappointing, and I think it was because the quality of the food didn't quite live up to the space.  It was fairly regular Asian Fusion, and perhaps its an indicator of how spoilt we in Toronto are for international cuisine, but there was a definite sense of \"been there, done that\" with most of the dishes that we got.  Not that they were necessarily poorly prepared, or didn't taste good, it's just that with so many other options to choose from in this city, and especially considering that it is definitely on the pricey side, Spice Route is going to have to up its game to keep a steady clientele."}
{"text":"The service is so bad that it's bordering on comical.  Expect to have the wrong dishes delivered.  Or, more than likely, the wait staff (happened to me twice) just forget to order your dish.  The decor is a wanna-be Tao of NYC circa 90's.  The food itself is a derivative fusion of some Caucasian's wretched version of Asian fusion.  The highlight that most patrons cite is the interestingly decorated--or over decorated--washroom.  That's a good thing since you'll likely would want to regurgitate what they serve you at this too trendy, over-hyped spot."}
{"text":"This review is based on the Sunday AYCE.  I of course had to check out the amazing bathrooms and the lychee martini I'd heard so much about, neither  disappointed.  My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed our meals but agreed that it was only made worthwhile by doing the sunday special, I don't think I would have cared for a full priced/sized portion of much of the food.  I have seen some reviews that say service was bad but we had a super friendly server, no complaints!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about spice route that my expectations were set too high. ok, 5 stars for the ambience. love the whole asian decor - very tastefully done. and that's where my positive sentiment about this place ends. we went for the winterlicious in early february. i agree cheryl's review - the portions of food are so pretentious. that is something i am just not ok with. i do not want to leave a place without being filled up. that makes me mad. i am ok with paying a higher price, but there has to be value for money. why pay a high price and receive tiny portions of substandard food? nothing we ordered that day was any different from what you would order in a food court chinese restaurant for 1/3 the price! we ordered the pot stickers, chow mein and honey chicken with rice. honestly, nothing to write home about. during our meal, my husband and I were thinking about which burger joint to hit after to fill our hunger! Guess I have made my point - this could be a good place for drinks but for a meal, definitely not."}
{"text":"My friend and I went on $1 sushi Thursday around 8pm, and they seated us right away. We ordered everything on the $1 sushi menu (+an alcoholic beverage each), and it was definitely fulfilling. Every plate was extremely delicious, and the setting was just as amazing and beautiful.   Their washrooms seemed pretty cool, however there's absolutely no light switch..or maybe I was too blind to find one.   Our bill only came to $45 This is a restaurant I highly recommend and will definitely be coming back to."}
{"text":"Terrible...awful..Asian food for non Asian people. Makes pfchang a fine dining experience. Try to copy Tao vegas but fail miserably. One star for the washroom...however what a waste of space n how long do u plan to stay in the washroom? Checkout Morimoto NYC washroom n u will be blown away in the stall itself. Service is slow, did not take our orders for a good 15 mins. Not a big deal as the bar scene was packed with people to watch. The music is so loud we had to shout out our orders. Spend your money elsewhere on food n go there for drinks."}
{"text":"I had high expectations about the restaurant and within the first 30-minutes; my expectations shattered and went spiralling down so fast like the bottle of Courvoisier I had last weekend!   1) Why pay so much for food, only to be hungry again within minutes after leaving? -The reaction of my friend when we received our main dish was, \"Is this a joke?\". Enough said! The portions were so small that we were still hungry after we left the restaurant...and no, we are not football players or sumo wrestlers! We are average (if not skinny) women all under 5'8.  2) You know you are not in good hands when the service at McDonalds seemed more high class! -The staff/waiter was not welcoming, and they seemed like expressionless and emotionless robots with an IQ of zero: i.e.-There were 5 of us with only 4 plate settings, and after a while we had to ask to have another one. It didn't occur to the waiter that there should be another one added (we shouldn't have had to ask!).  - After waiting 30-minutes for soup, one of the bowls didn't have a spoon and when we asked the waiter for another one it seemed like it took 2-minutes for him to process our request in his head, and then went off to get it... 10-minutes later we got it, and by then the soup was cold.  -Our main dish was not served at the same time: 3 of us were served first, a few minutes later the 4th, and an even longer wait for the last. It's pretty ironic that my friend who got her dish last, wasn't even cooked properly! It was raw (no we did not order sushi)! You'd think that would be the first dish served!   3) Looks like the staff missed the boat on restaurant etiquette/courtesy/common sense 101! -The lowest blow to the poor quality of service was that the waiter nor the manager didn't even come back to follow-up and see if the improperly cooked dish was ok the second time 'round. Every restaurant I went to (when the dish was not properly cooked), we got a sincere apology from the manager and usually a free desert, meal or even vouchers to ensure future visits. We got...NONE OF THE ABOVE!  4) Mommy always said to part on good terms! -So even though I was highly disappointed with the overall experience, I thought I would leave with some nice comments, and the reason why I gave this establishment 1 star instead of 0. The décor was beautiful, the bathroom was impressive, the Mongolian beef was tasty (although a bowl of rice couldn't have broken the bank with the amount patrons are charged) and the most important thing... We are still alive (although hungry)!  FYI- You can't call yourselves an Asian restaurant if you don't even serve RICE!"}
{"text":"Ambience was good. The drinks were good. That's about all of the positive comments I have to say about this place. Spice Route must be an ironic name, because our food was beyond bland. A group of us ordered a variety of things off the menu, and the only one worth eating was the fried rice. Even the pad thai was a huge disappointment. You are honestly way better getting Chinese from a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that will have a lot more flavour! And won't be way over-priced. The birthday girl in our group was so disappointed. On top of it, one meal was brought 15 minutes before any other food arrived, and one meal (that was made to accommodate an allergy) never showed at all. The only slight redemption was the free bottle of champagne they gave us to make up for our unenjoyable over-priced meal."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I had orange chicken and it was really tasty the place is also really amazing!!"}
{"text":"ok... i know that many people gave this place some bad review... and I might wont be popular for liking it.. but i DO!  the Asian food was very good and the service was amazing! our waiter was very knowledgeable, very attentive to any request. the place was packed, but after dinner we headed to the patio for a drink and easily found a nice place to sit and drink something. the washrooms are very nice as well. (always good)."}
{"text":"Restaurant was only a third full on a Thursday night at 8:00, yet the service was terrible. Over 20 minutes to get drinks.  Food was very sub par, slow delivery and several mistakes with our order. Confirmed with the manager they had a change with head chef.  Looks like they need to find another one.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines dinner saturday night. At 7pm the place was empty. That should have been my first clue. Ordered Pakoras as appetizer and got Tempura. Had to call the wait staff and explain to her the difference from their Menu. The Meal was expensive and tasteless. I wish i had read the comments on Yelp before booking. Sorry i will not be going there again"}
{"text":"This bar looks sick but the crowd in here can be straight up custy...I went on sunday for the all you can eat food one time and was decent.  The staff is nice, but dont even try to chat up dem other women in there, they are so stuck up. Once again, aint talking abou the staff, they super nice and shit.  If you want to meet real women, that aint all pretentious gotta hit another joint.  Singapore noodles is crazy good."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because my wife had purchased a voucher. The outside of the restaurant was understated, and had we walked, we certainly would have passed it by. Luckily, we took a cab and the driver knew of the restaurant by memory.   The inside of the restaurant had a very posh and upscale feel to it, though I felt that the lighting was too dim. We were seated in a comfortable booth where we met our friends who had arrived earlier.   Their menu features several Asian fusion dishes, and after looking everything over, we settled on the lettuce wraps to start with, and the kung pao chicken and pad Thai for our main course.  To be honest, I wasn't exactly blown away by the food, but it was by no means terrible. One of our friends ordered the chicken and it seemed a bit raw. We notified our server and he was happy to replace it for us.   The place certainly looks like a night club in some respects, and would probably make for a good place to hang out on a Friday night. Would not come back just for the food though."}
{"text":"Lousy service and some of the lamest/rudest people in the city hang out here."}
{"text":"It only gets A-OK because it is so beautiful. Great atmosphere, incredible washrooms.  Terrible Food, Awful Service."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone downwards over the last two years. Six of us for dinner and the service was terrible - apps didn't come at the same time for all and one was left without despite having ordered it.   The waiter could care less about our happiness or level of satisfaction with either the food or his service.  None of us will be back and we will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A fun spot to go after work or on the weekend.  You go here for the ambiance, not the food, which is really just glammed up chinese fast food.  The patio and bar have great decor, and the place is spacious.  The service was poor as the place is so busy no one has the time to pay proper attention.  We were definitely rushed with the bill so we could free up our table.  The tempura fried tuna roll was a bit overdone to the point that the tuna inside was cooked.   The Pecking duck lettuce wraps there have always been a winner."}
{"text":"I will never return to this place. First and foremost this was my first time ever trying this place out. I had never heard about it before and was invited to check it out for a friends birthday. Upon arriving I thought it looked absolutely beautiful outside and the decor  inside was definitely up to par. It seemed like a beautiful set up so the food and service had to match, right? Boy was I wrong. Although the food was good it was too over priced especially for sushi. Our waiter didn't look interested at all in serving our table and we always had to call someone over. The only person that ever showed up at our table was the food runner who was basically filling in for our waiter as he was never present. The worst part was that even when we would call him over, he would ignore us and walk the other way.  When the bills arrived we had realized that there was a charge for food items we hadn't ordered. We told the waiter about it and he insisted that we had ordered the food when we had not. The waiter was being beyond disrespectful and decided to speak with a  manager. This man was equally as rude stating that he couldn't do anything about it and we should just pay. Now people reading this may think okay you probably were just lying and trying to cheat this place out of money. Its sad but a lot of people do try to do this when they are a larger group. Now our bill came to 450 dollars for 8 people. Why would we try to cheat a place out of 20 dollars worth of food when we were already spending 400+? You would think the manager would try to be courtesy and work something out but instead this man walked away not having a care in the world. This is definitely no place for a birthday which is sad because it definitely had the potential for greatness. However with the horrible service and pricing there is no way I would recommend this place to someone else."}
{"text":"Best lychee Martinis in Toronto. Food is good too. We have gone a number of times. Food never disappoints. Atmosphere is pretty modern and there's a cool vibe in the air. Feel so blessed I live on King St so that I can enjoy great places like this."}
{"text":"Brought my fiance here today for his birthday and im glad I did! Turned out it was $1 sushi Thursdays. Since were both sushi lovers we seized the opportunity and got a few nigiris and sushi rolls. SO GOOD! Probably the best I've had. The main reason is because of their chili mayo sauce...to die for! Also, the size of the sushi rolls. They wern't ridiculously big and I could actually (somewhat elegantly might i add) fit one whole piece in my mouth.   The atmosphere is dark, romantic. Definitely somewhere to bring a SO or even for a fun night out with your girlfriends. They have a nice patio as well for when its nice out. The decor is beautifull. Havent been anywhere this nice in Toronto!   Service was good, could be better. I felt they needed more waiters. Ours was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu but I had to wait at times to get a refill of water and to get the check. It wasnt crowded plus I had reservations so we didnt wait at all.  Price wise...well $1 sushi im not complaining! Definitely good sushi and good price. Their main dishes (judging by the menu) were between 17-25 which is alao very reasonable.  Will I be back? YES! I want to try that red snapper dish...."}
{"text":"Okay - the decor is nice but that's the only positive about the Spice Route.  Here's how our night went :  Arrived 10 minutes before our reservation - snotty hostess tells us we have to wait and our other guests are at the bar - does not offer to take our coats or walk us to the bar  Get to the bar - ignored by the bartenders (not busy) for over 10 minutes, ask about wine - trust me you don't want to know their response. Drinks arrived one at a time...  I noticed a sketchy looking male standing by a glass door - he's waring baggy black jeans, a  bomber jacket and a cap of some sort - since when do fine dining establishments have club doorman inside at smoking entrances ( had to wonder \"what his real job was and what he was selling\")  Another 10 minutes later and we are seated -no one offers to take our drinks to our table. Next our chairs are so high compared to the table height  our knees scrape  the table's \"under\" this is followed by a menu so dark it would be hard to read if there was light never mind the fact we are sitting in the dark ...can they not afford electricity??  As you can see the whole experience has not been good and I haven't even got to the food yet -  the food was bland and tasteless. Our waitress  told us to order only four dishes as this would be more than enough for the four of us....boy was this incorrect.  Starting at about 10pm they start turning the lights down more and the music up  loud so we must shout to hear one another - and the crowd that begins to be allowed...hoodlums and dancing girls - I guess \"For your Eyes Only\"  I recommend you don't waste your time and skip the Spice Route!"}
{"text":"I'd give the venue 8/10 and the food 5.5/10, whatever you do don't get the shrimp tacos. It says there's a pineapple and mango salsa but it just tastes like a shrimp and mayonnaise taco, most of the main plates only come with meat and nothing to eat it with. Overall not what I expected when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night for drinks. Bar service was terrible! The bartenders purposely avoid eye contact with anyone who is not pushy and almost reaching over the bar for attention. After being ignored for 20 minutes at the main bar we went to the smaller, less busy bar near the washrooms. Once there, waiters and waitresses were constantly pushing in front of us. Another 10 minutes went by without being served. The bartender constantly avoided eye contact. A waiter then told me to go back to the main bar as this one was for waiting staff only and was not for customers. That made no sense as we saw others order drinks from here.  After a few more minutes I finally got the bartenders attention and ordered our overpriced drinks. It seems the only way to get a beverage in this place is to act loud and obnoxious like most of the clientele."}
{"text":"What a ripoff!!  I went with a group for the so-called \"$5 martinis and free box of noodles\" Thursday Happy Hour.  The bill ended up being STAGGERING.  They tacked on an 18% gratuity without telling us ahead of time, and would not split the bills (again without telling us ahead of time) and the whole thing came out to $300. I had to cover the extra gratuity and ended up paying $69 for 2 martinis and 1 tiny plate of pakoras! Never again - a total waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"The highlight of Spice Route is its atmosphere. An amazing venue for a date, group dinner, family dinners, etc. Alongside the \"asian fusion\" foodie trend, the restaurant is incredibly decorated and furnished.   The food was as expected from an \"asian fusion\" restaurant - the flavours satisfies your cravings, but the quality isn't the best you've ever had. Pricing is also what you'd expect from a trendy-King St restaurant.   Going at an early time is definitely suggested, because when it is busy the staff can become pretty flustered.  Multiple people are tending to your table which almost makes it more hectic and overwhelming.   If you have any allergies - the kitchen staff are pretty knowledgable, just make sure you express your concerns clearly to the wait staff.  Recommendations: - Lemon Chicken"}
{"text":"Hip and happening after dark this is fast becoming a place to see and be seen. Service is attentive and prompt (thanks Paty). The food is excellent. We had the Cantonese Chow mein (which is incredible), crispy duck (very good) and dim sum platter (not bad). All ingredients exude quality, no skimping here. Wine list is Ok. All in including taxes, tip and wine was like $90 for two. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came to celebrate Valentine's Day with our friends. The place is very nicely decorated, modern and sleek. It was a little dark and too noisy for me. The service was great. Victoria, our server, was extremely helpful. The food was delicious, I especially liked green dragon roll - one of the best I tried. We had tried lobster plate, which was pretty good, vegetable tempura, shrimps as appetizers. Hot stone appetizer is pretty cool - you cool thinly sliced beef on a hot stone. However this wouldn't be my first choice, I cook too much at home so when I go to the restaurant I prefer to be served  But guess what - guys liked it! The restrooms are weird, some people had trouble figuring out how to get in and lock the door. But I understand they are part of the experience  There was staff helping people to get in to cut learning curve All-in-all it was a great experience and if music wasn't so loud it would be almost perfect"}
{"text":"Literally the only reason I would ever set foot in this place again is to use their washrooms. The washrooms are gorgeous and pretty much Spice Route's only redeeming quality.  I doubt they'd even be in business if it werent for the weekend crowd from the 905.   I've been here a few times with friends on different occasions and different times of the day, week, etc. and the service, the food, and the drinks have been consistently terrible. The sangria was watery that summer afternoon on the patio. The gin martinis were very VERY vermouthey on my friend's birthday. The servers are snippy, slow, and one even finished her shift without passing us to someone else. The person that took over & had our table did not even know she had people sitting in her section. It was brutal. The food is expensive, bland, and small. Crabcakes still frozen on the inside... you get the drift."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times before and had a pretty good experience. Good food, ok service and great atmosphere.  However have completely changed my opinion on this place based on the complete mismanagement recently. What really blows me away is how any restaurant/bar in a city like Toronto where there is a ton of competition can treat their clientele like cattle. After racking up dinner dishes, apps and drinks, we were told after our second or third round of drinks and not too long after finishing our mains that we had to pay our bill and go to the bar or leave! Are you serious?? Who does that?? I don't blame our waiter who was amazing the entire night but rather the clueless manager who came up and made the request despite the fact that not once had he even bothered to stop by and ask how things were going at any point earlier.  I've worked in the industry in the past waiting tables and tending bar and I can honestly say I've not seen something like this. I would totally understand if we were sitting there with waters or getting refills on coffees but the fact that we were continuing to add to the bill with the overpriced drinks and you force us out makes no sense.  Maybe not overbooking your reservations instead of pushing your paying clientele out the door would be a better idea?   To be honest there's nothing about the menu or the atmosphere that you couldn't find at any number of other spots in the city where as a bonus you would actually enjoy your dining experience."}
{"text":"Lovely place so I was expecting an equally lovely experience but while the staff was nice they seemed confused. We had a couple people come and take our drink order, a couple people show up for our meal orders and food that came at wrong times with weird excuses. I have to say that I didn't mind the tuna sushi apps but the beef main was very fatty. Enjoyed the black cod.  I feel like I could only eat about 20% of the food that was brought to the table and the price point seemed pretty high for the quality of  what we got.. Drinks were good and the toilets rocked but for the prices I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"When we found out that Spice Route, Asian Bistro & Bar had $1 sushi on Thursdays, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it as we knew this place isn't a cheap-eat.  The entrance is very dramatic and grandeur- when you go inside the restaurant, it's even more dramatic with the lighting, open concept booths, asian-inspired walls, furniture and floor to ceiling glass windows.  It's a beautiful place to eat, that's for sure! Seeing that there's a outdoor dining area, we'll definitely want to try that next time we visit.  We order a bottle of Tozai \"living jewel\" sake.  It was light with a bit of sweetness to it, which was good to drink with our sushi and rolls.  The Red Hot Roll had tempura shrimp, spicy salmon, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber and tobiko.  It was delicious and SUCH A STEAL as a Thursday Night Special.  It was everything a delicious roll was - a perfect combination of ingredients complementing instead of overwhelming each other.   The White Tuna Sashimi was to die for and probably the best we've ever had.  Salmon Nigiri was pretty spectacular as well.  It's harder for simple sashimi and nigiri to be amazing unless the fish quality and the rice was perfect since they don't have various toppings and sauces to provide flavour.  However  the sushi & nigiri pieces at Spice Route were so yummy!  The Volcano Roll consists of spicy salmon, white tuna, avocado, asparagus, tobiko and chili mayo. Very flavourful as well.  It was so yummy that we had to get another plate of it!  fter we were done, they served us these delightful Sweet Rolls, which were the perfect finish to our meal.  They were warm and crispy on the outside but as you took a bite, you can feel how soft and fluffy it was inside.  They were served with a pear sauce but we liked it better without it.  As for the service, throughout the night, our server made sure all the food was to our liking and checked up on us many times. She was friendly, efficient welcoming.  Their great service definitely made us want to come here again and try the rest of the things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Get the lychee martini- its amazing! Love the atmosphere at this place, and the washrooms are really pretty although extremely DARK. Thursdays are cheep nights if you like great Sushi for $1 (great deal)"}
{"text":"Five years ago, Spice Route was great. No more. They don't split bills which makes hosting large groups super awkward. Get with the times!  Our server had zero wine knowledge. Not even what the house wine was. Like seriously? How does he keep this job?  I could go on, but just don't bother unless you're waiting for a reso somewhere else and just need a drink."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious. It decor is absolutely beautiful. However, the service I received was much less than par. I had the waiter hand me a hot plate over a few people to put on my own table and the waitresses kept asking me if i wanted water eventhough it was clear that my cup was empty. I loved the dessert. However, I wasn't too thrilled about the main. It tasted very ordinary and the chicken was really dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"Looking to try Spice Route during Winterlicious? DON'T!   I decided to try Spice Route with two others during  Winterlicious. Both of my guests had tried Spice Route previously and highly recommended it. Their Winterlicious menu was advertised as an all you can eat, Asian Street market styled event all for the price of 40$. I'm a huge fan of Asian Street food and I love trying new places during  Winterlicious, so I thought this would be great! Boy was I wrong.   To sum up my experience: dry, cold, overcooked and limited selection. For example, all the meat skewers in the meat section were super cold and dry. The lemon chicken they had tasted like it would have been good.. Had it not been mega overcooked! I only found one decent dish in all the stations (the curry shrimp) but besides that, everything else was terrible. Honestly, it felt like they paid Manchuwok to cater for them during this 'food event'. I take that back. Manchuwok probably has better food.   My friends that had previously eaten at Spice Route were confused. They kept telling me how it wasn't like this before . Even so, I'd probably never eat there on a non-Winterlicous night.   I left that restaurant feeling scammed. I've had bad food and restaurant experiences before, but I've never felt scammed.   My advice to you reading this: take that 40$ and spend it elsewhere. In fact, you'd probably be happier spending that 40$ at McDonald's. Avoid this place. Especially during their 'food events'."}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone even goes here after such horrible reviews?  This place is specifically for those that want to be seen here. That's it. Which makes sense.. because the type of people that enjoy this place don't eat.  We made reservations for 5 and it took 20minutes (bad).   The front hostess was sweet and apologetic.   We walked in...and it was downhill from here.  The decor is beautiful , if you have no originality. It's supposed to give off this meditative feel but it's purely a social gathering spot. The tables are hard, uncomfortable. Our table was wobbly.  We asked for water and we got sparkling water in glass bottles? - what the? The server (horrid at her job) insisted that it we \"forgot\" we ordered sparkling water. Oh Lord. Good sense would've been to have left - right about now. Hunger and late timing won our best judgements. :(  order: Indian dip with naan - one was a guacamole - since when is guacamole Indian? and the other 2 were really spicy. It had a red pepper taste to it.  The naan was not sharing friendly. The portion is decent for 1 person. Even then, we barely had anymore than the first few bites.  Veg spring rolls: This wasn't bad. I've had them before at cheaper restaurants and it tastes the same.   Crab cakes - This was yummy, but def not enough to share :(  Tempura calamari & rock shrimp - HORRIBLE! I was praying that it was like Ki's rock shrimp,. unfortunately it was not. Fail. It dough wasn't even fully cooked. Yuck.   Steamed rice: myeh. I've had wayyy better. At least she was nice enough to give us a good portion.  chkn with black bean - Bad. I'm not sure why, but it tasted SO vinegary. It had a horrible smell to it. Maybe it was a bad batch?   kung pao chicken - not bad. We ordered 2 of these and pretty much settled to the idea that people don't eat here. Our server was the only one coming and going with food. To our table.  Everyone else just sat around with drinks and something super light. Untouched. Wierddddd....   At this point we were SO disappointed, we just asked for the bill..  HAHA - this is the part where we pretty much laughed out loud. Truly , there was nothing else we couldve done to display what a joke this was.  $279.23 PLUS tip PLUS service - WHAT?   I was so shocked. I felt like I barely ate anything satisfying.  By now the lights started to dim and the circular bar in the main dining room turned on it's weird lava lamp type of lights.  Walking out , on the right side, there's a private room that looked gorgeous from what I could see. It has curtains covering it. Apparently you have to book that room in way advance.   As I was leaving I said out loud \" pffft this place has NOTHING on Ki\" making sure that most of the servers and hostess heard. What? I was telling nothing but the truth. Hmph!  xoxo M."}
{"text":"I came here on a cold Friday with 3 of my friends so we didn't check out the patio. This was your typical King Street West restaurant. Very nice decor and just an overall upscale vibe. The food was nothing special, just classic westernized Asian cuisine, but I definitely can't complain about it. Would recommend the starters as well as the cocktails!  The only downside to my visit was that they forgot one of our orders! The waiters always seemed to be running around and it was hard to get the bill.  Overall, not a bad place if you're just looking for an average place to eat and hang out. If you're looking for excellent food and service, take a walk down King Street West and dine elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I went to Spice Route for a friend's farewell party.  They had pre-reserved one of the cabanas on the patio.  The atmosphere was nice, the decor asian inspired.  We started off the evening by ordered a couple of appetizers and a pitcher of their spiked tea.  The nan dip and dim sum appetizers were bland and flavourless.  My friend and I really enjoyed the spiked tea, you could not tell it was spiked!  For $25, the pitcher gets you about 6 drinks worth.  We followed our appetizer order with a side of sweet yams fries.  They were huge wedges of sweet potato with a spicy ketchup sauce; the fries were much more enjoyable than the previous appetizers - mind you cannot go wrong with anything fried.  Overall, the food was sub-par but the atmosphere was great.  Good crowd, but no dance floor.  Good place to hang out with friends for the evening.  I would definitely recommend reserving a cabana for a large group."}
{"text":"Spice Route is not everyone's cup of tea.  I've been here a few times for lounging and if you are just hanging out the place is not so bad.  It's a nice looking trendy venue where you can get food and drinks.  We arrived on a Saturday night and wanted to just hang out, nothing crazy.   The bouncers greeted us and were polite.  There was no cover which was good.  We wanted a table and we went to the front to ask the hostess for one. She gave us a pager-plastic-flashy device to let us know when the next table was available.  They were friendly and didn't give us any attitude which was a pleasant surprise.  It was about a 15 minute wait for our table.  We ordered the wasabi-crispy shrimp and the calamari with rock shrimp.  The food was acceptable, pretty much what I expected.  Except the wasabi shrimp wasn't spicy at all, just green.  They gave us these butter sweet buns on the house which were like tasty little croissants.  The drinks aren't stupidly expensive and the server was attentive and kept asking us if we needed anything.  One of the best things about the place are the bathrooms. The bathrooms at this place are awesome. One sided mirrors where you can see the garden in the back. They have large private stalls with the male washroom attendant outside directing bathroom traffic.  The clientale is a bit older.  A lot of suits. Average looking folks, not a lot of eye candy.  But if you are on King and want a place to pop in for a few drinks, this venue isn't so bad!  I just wouldn't come here for dinner."}
{"text":"The place is a den for yuppies. Not only did Spice Route make me wait for over 20 minutes for my starter and dessert, the so-called \"hot\" waitress was a bitch and my dinner had me running for the bathroom when I got home. If you plan on going bring pepto and plenty of patience.   They dim the lighting so you can't see your flavourless food. The waitress had an attitude and blamed everyone and their mother for the long wait.   The tempura banana \"sounds\" amazing but its literally a ball of batter.   If you're a dude, have a thing for contemporary design and don't care what your food tastes like then this place is for you."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday, we were in town for our Date Night. Great atmosphere, you do not feel like you are in Toronto at all. We ordered drinks, an appetizer and two mains. Since the app took awhile to come in, we mentioned it to our server. He said he would comp it which was very nice. We didn't look too happy overall so the Manager came over and he served us personally and apologized. Then at the end they brought us dessert(coconut cheesecake, mmmm) and when it was time to pay we just paid for the drinks. They made us feel very special, and when we voiced our concerns they were definitely heard. I think this place is great - I see some complaints on Yelp but I am questioning - did you folks be honest and let them know? We did and not only got top service, excellent food but our date night was paid for and overall they went beyond our expectations. They definitely care about their customers and I will go back. Thanks gentlemen - you made our night great (young couple by the bar, girl in pink blouse and guy in cream sweater)! :) Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of my girlfriends for one of our best friends birthday. Our waitress was lovely , she was so accommodating for one of our friends gluten allergy. The atmosphere was also great! The food was amazing! I definitely recommend this place for people who are looking for great service, atmosphere and yummy food!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is good if your between 26-33. Anything younger prob wouldn't like it. Its good for going for a drink and wanting to talk to ppl. the music is not overly loud but good. Also good if you want to start here and head somewhere else after.   Door staff is nice and fair. Bar is busy but service is usually pretty fast.   I have eaten there before but would probably not go there just for the food.   The ambiance, and decor is very nice."}
{"text":"The Good: Atmosphere & decor The Bad: the food is mediocre at best.  We went for summerlicious - the food was extremely bland and not one bit exciting. The service was decent.  I would go back here for some after work drinks, but would not recommend for dinner!  Bonus: the bathrooms are super cool."}
{"text":"I went here with a few girlfriends for martinis and although the patio is pretty cool in the summertime this place is definitely way overpriced for what you get and the service that night really wasn't that great.  The decor is pretty cool as other people have mentioned and maybe that's to detract from what little else this place has going on. I typically don't bother writing negative reviews but the service here was pretty bad and I'm normally not that sensitive about stuff like that.  It was a good experience to hang out here once and awhile but definitely not a place I'd regularly attend.  This was on a weekday however, so maybe the weekends are better as some of the reviews seem to suggest."}
{"text":"The place was empty for a Saturday night dinner.  It should have been our first clue.  We ordered pakoda and got tempura.  The tempura batter was awful.   The pakoda were under fried.  Awful.  The pad thai was okay.  Just blah!.  Kuang pao chicken was so plain.   No rice to go with it.  Pricey for the kind of dish we got. I would not go again.   I would not recommend it.  It seems to be a drinking place late at night.   Drunk people don't care what they eat!!"}
{"text":"Not my scene.  I had high expectations for this overpriced restaurant, but was very disappointed with the quality of the food here.  We tried quite a few dishes and I was only impressed with one dessert dish - the dragon rolls.  The plates are inconvenient sizes, making it impossible to share dishes without awkwardness.  Most of the dishes were half-empty, so there was really no need for this.  The kimchi rice and pad thai noodles were insanely large portions, but I didn't like either of them.  They were quite boring and bland.    I liked the décor - kinda funky and rustic, but didn't like not being able to see (it was very dark) or hear (it was very noisy).    We had a reservation but still had to wait a few minutes to talk to any of the many hostesses who were all working with the Maitre D' to seat 2 people who arrived just before us.  Seriously, how many people does it take?  I would have expected to at least be greeted by one of 5 people just standing there.  Washrooms are crazy weird.  You go through a sliding barn door into an oversized washroom, complete with private sink.  It's really dark in there (probably so you can't tell if it's clean or dirty) but there's plenty of light filtering in from the gigantic window you're supposed to pee in front of.  I'm hoping nobody has access to the courtyard that this window faces, but it still made me feel very uncomfortable.  Interesting concept, but not my cup of tea.  Service was great when you could get somebody's attention.  This is the type of place that comes by to fold your napkin for you when you've left the table to go to the washroom.  It was really busy when we were there so everything (ordering, getting our food, clearing our table, getting dessert menus, getting the bill, etc.) took longer than it should have.  I might return for drinks only as they have a few interesting cocktails on their menu, but I won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"This place is up there, with some of the most pretentious spots anywhere in Toronto. It's all a conspiracy to steal your money, disguised in a neatly wrapped, shiny box. And when you open the box, you'll end up with something similar to your local takeaway.  The entire experience can be summed up like this: A building fit for King Street West, with the food comparable to a small town Chinese restaurant, staffed by white people whose cultural horizon with Asian cuisine is as flat as the heart monitor line of NDP's political campaign.  The menu was so mediocre, I don't see any reason on reviewing it. I've had better packaged meals from grocery store in the frozen foods section. My table was wobbly, if I hadn't came with two girlfriends of mine, I would have not ordered the wine. I was wearing fur, too risky. The decorations was trying to emulate a Zen like space, but that all burnt up with the incense after 10pm, as it became intolerably loud. I really wish it was called \"Spice Route Lounge\" instead, to warn me of the late-night crowds. I had trouble hearing what my friends sitting beside me were saying.  I noticed a bunch of yuppies leaning on the bar in their daytime suits, gawking at the girls in the restaurant while fiddling with their pocket change with one hand, and holding their remarkably emasculating drinks with the other. I think it was the Bay Street mating stance.  The waiter approached me questioning the reason why I short-tipped him, because it wasn't the 'regular' 15 percent. Let's just say I had the bouncers at stand-by throughout my entire conversation with our \"service\" person. I don't remember ordering the beef."}
{"text":"Ambience is great, service is very good, and the menu selection is decent with some different from the usual choices. Everything was average to tasty.   We had a nice bottle of Sake.  And for food it is family style with sharing plates. Good to get a mixed sampling of dishes.  All in all a good time!"}
{"text":"Asian food meant for sharing. Service was confused (literally) and not upto par to other king st restaurants. Wine list has little local wines, would like to see more unique local offerings."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night for dinner.  The cold draft from the door sweeps into the lower seating area, so we had to change tables to the upper level to be comfortable. The bathrooms were spacious individual rooms each with strangely exposing glass windows, though private. We tried the fixed winterlicious menu. The spring rolls were nice and crispy, pot stickers were tasty, the maki were the most filling and mussels were small but with good broth. After the interesting appetizers the surf and turf was a let down. The food was fresh and good quality, but flavourless. We had to add generous portions of the dipping sauces to enjoy it. The salmon was just okay. For dessert the pineapple ice cream was very good, and the cranberry wontons were unfortunately under stuffed and over fried.  We wanted to try the cranberry spiked tea, but they ran out of the tea. That was disappointing so we tried the spiked lemon tea but it was nothing special. We also had a big heavy pot of the red ginger tea which was super hot and quite good.  $25 seemed a slightly high for the portion, as $20 would have been better value.  Ambiance was was nice, I enjoyed the entrance and the lounging areas looked inviting and comfortable but we didn't stay for the evening. Overall I don't thing we'll visit again for dinner"}
{"text":"Seriously? Save your money. Yes the ambiance is cool, the place has all the trappings to be hip, but the food could have been cooked at any Chinese food restaurant and you'd never know the difference. Too much salt, and flavorless. We were a party of 8 and no one liked their dinner. Sad."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still up and running. Went here for a bachelor party for drinks."}
{"text":"After going past here so many times and seeing the entrance lined with its flaming torches,  just seemed too 'hells kitchen' for me to want to go in. Thoughts of having to endure Gordan Ramsey type f**ing and blinding while I ate...I mean drank.  So boy was I wrong, I totally get that a Friday and Saturday will probably be a different experience so until then I give it a five.  The place is really nice, it has a nice ambience with a great central bar area. It was not loud or busy when I went so a perfect place to relax and enjoy a great menu of drinks and Asian fused cocktails, and pitchers which are the better deal $25.  The wash rooms are also an experience, walking past the cubicles some have an outside window view which is a great touch. Makes you feel one with nature when going for the number 2 I think.  Being a Sunday evening it was a perfect setting to wind down and chat and eventually with the A/C on it got colder inside than it was outside so moving to the outside patio I was again greeted by Spice Lounge awesomeness.  Comfy seating, variety of sit down large areas, smaller tables or high seats right by the Koi Pond. The small trees that create a sort of barrier from the noisy King Street is a great idea but if you do like a patio where you can people watch then this is not it.  I hope when I decide to return here on a Fri/Sat evening that it is not ruined by pretentious twats, but this is King Street so I suppose that is inevitable."}
{"text":"The only thing nice about spice route is the decor. A lot of money has gone into the beauty of the restaurant and it is beautiful. Exactly why I gave this place a second chance. I thought they must be doing something right to be doing so well. Well I was wrong. I think it's Toronto lack of similar venues that has contributed to the success of Spice Route.   Management should invest in training staff on customer service.   I don't remember what I ordered the first time. But I remember it being bland and I was disappointed. Our waiter was trying to rush us from the time we sat Down. We tried to ask for menu suggestions and he gave some half ass response rather than trying to help.  The 2nd time I called to make a late night reservation. I was told the late night menu is open until 1 and the venue closes at 3. No problem. We got there at 12:30. I literally had to run around the restaurant to try and ask about the menu. Turns out the kitchen closed already. That's fine we understood it was late even though we were told differently by the hostess. Whatever, we're understanding people. What I don't understand is that we are standing at the bar, it's not busy at all and the bartender is standing right in front of us and would not even make eye contact to offer to take our order. She went over to the other side of the car and took someone else's order... Ok maybe they were waiting longer... But shouldn't she say she'll be with us in a minute? Atleast acknowledge we're waiting? What a b*tch! I honestly hope she fell off of the mule she's  so high on top of... You're a waitress buddy, relax!   Anyways I will never be back here again. I'm not the only one to think that this place sucks. 2 1/2 stars average should be some indication that changes need to be done."}
{"text":"The giant flames at the front door are a bad omen, and for sure, Spice Route is embarrassing from beginning to end.   It has no idea of what real modern Asian fusion is all about, and much of what it serves resembles bad take-out Chinese.   If you actually want spice (or flavour), go somewhere else.    The venue is typical \"King Street-trying-to-be-LA\": oversized, over-noisy, over-designed, over-rated, up itself but utterly without style.   The waiters treat you like an innocent abroad, though I suspect few of them have been abroad, for example, to places like Australia where Asian fusion cuisine is setting astonishing new standards that - let's face it - are never really likely to hit King West.    The main concern of our waiter was to hysterically over-hype the really bad food, without showing any real knowledge of either the appallingly confused menu or the drinks list.   And while the designers clearly think that the large stylized image of skulls and bone fragments from what can only be the Khmer Rouge killing fields in Cambodia is \"edgy\", I just found it as tasteless as the food.   If you are unlucky enough to find yourself being fed or watered in this barn, try  to escape before 10pm when the clothes you arrived in for dinner are no longer good enough, and the call girls and their pimps arrive to ply their trade (for Spice Route, read Spice Rack).       In sum, for those who take secret pleasure in Toronto at its tackiest and most clueless, be sure to follow the Spice Route."}
{"text":"Really nice outdoor patio.  Food was fairly decent, drinks were just ok.  Service was probably the worst in the city.  It was obvious our waiter wished he were anywhere else.  Because of this, we wouldn't go back.  There are too many other restaurants with great service in the city."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks. Great environment. This is a classy, chill place that you can come to and wined down after a long day or week. Came to grab a drink during our vacation and got a $4 whiskey and coke that was well prepared. Great place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  awesome, which you can tell from outside.  Lit torches at the entranceway, with a scary-looking, dark, medieval-like, wooden door to enter.  You can also see the large side-patio from the front through some well-sculpted Asian-looking trees.  But was too chilly last night to eat outside.  So inside - very large.  Greeted by the stereotypical 'hot' girls in black at the reception.  We had reservations for four at 6:00 and were about 20 mins late, but that was fine.  Were seated at a booth in the center of the main area.  My cushioned bench itself must've had someone really large person sit in it before, because I fell quite INTO the seat itself, which was only slightly uncomfortable (no sarcasm there).  Wasn't bad enough to ask for another table.  In the center of the room is a large wrap around bar, focused on a huge red rectangular fountain that goes floor to ceiling.  The whole place itself is dark with Asian inspired candles, clean lines, decorative random items, etc.  And the bathrooms!  Most unique I've ever experienced.  Instead of a mens' and ladies' room, they just have individual private stalls where the fully private door slides open, and locks via a switch similar to a light switch.  Dark inside but lit up naturally by the full wall WINDOW on the opposite side of the door.  So you are literally sitting on the toilet, directly next to a full view of the outside.  lol  Fortunately, this is a sectioned off area of the patio where no roamers outside can walk by.  So spa-like and tranquil is the view of outside too - several small 'tap-like' fountains coming out of a further wall, to encourage peeing I guess?  lol  A large female statue in the middle, which you may not notice if you're in any of the stalls at the beginning or the end of the hallway, but if you peek out your window, you will see in the center of this private 'yard' area.  Also nice bowl sinks in the bathrooms, with a proper hand soap dispenser that you would have at home, instead of the ugly industrial wall types.  Menu:  Loved it more than I thought I would. Excellent Buddha vegetable feast stir fry.  This is more of an appetizer or lunch.  In fact, it would be a great lunch.  Mix of baby corn, different types of mushrooms, snow peas, tofu, in a mild but flavorful Asian sauce. Excellent Indian dips with naan bread - although they could have a few more pieces of pita.  Definitely fun to share but just teases the appetite with its somewhat smallness.  Very good vegetable pakora with a yogurt dipping sauce - fried Indian spiky things, which obviously are well-known to those who eat a lot of Indian.  But I've only ever had the basics, so don't remember these before anywhere.  Very good sweet yam fries with a homemade sambal ketchup? Excellent veggie spring rolls -but again, quite small, just enough to tease.  Had to wait a bit for these to cool off, and had to ask for plum sauce.  Mind you, they tasted good enough without any sauce required. Large portion of the Singapore rice noodles with beef.  I didn't try it for being vegetarian, but am told it was excellent.  Drinks: ordered a $54 bottle of some pinot grigio that I can't recall, but was fine.  Excellent sangria recommended by the waitor that I can't find on the menu.  Could not taste the alcohol, but certainly felt its effects.  lol  Very light OJ taste overall, so a bit sweet, but not too much.  Four of us split two pitchers of that at $25/pitcher, so you could say we each drank half a pitcher.  I am not hungover the next day, well, not too bad.  :)   Also tried a pitcher of some spiked fruity tea which was excellent but I can't find on the menu either.   Service:  quite good overall.  Attentive, friendly waitor.  Our only problem was at the end when we requested separate bills, he quoted \"our manager gets upset when we separate the bills.\"  Okay.  I dislike this at any restaurant, but he explained all the time it takes to adjust and how customer service will suffer to others waiting for their food, etc.  Whatever.  The manager did come to our table at least twice over the night to make sure everything else was fine.  So that wouldn't keep me from going back there.  But I'd remember to mention the separate bills in advance at least.  $$$:  total for the night for the four of us: $225.  Mind you we ate a LOT.  When you look at the $60-70 each that works out to after tip, it was a good deal.   Next time I have visitors come in from out of town, I will definitely take them here."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for drinks with some friends and as far as a bar/lounge goes, this is not bad.  The drinks were pretty inexpensive about $6-$7 CAD each but the bartender was measuring each shot, kind of lame.  We got there around 10, no line, no cover, busy but not crowded.  The patio is nice and big with couches and tables, but looked like they were table service only, not sure.  As the night went on, it got busier and busier and they were limiting the amount of people allowed out on the patio.  The real interesting part of this place was the bathrooms!  It's hard to explain but I'll try anyways.  Towards the back of the restaurant there is a long hallway lit in red.  For the women, the attendant usher's you into a room with a sliding door.  This door has frosted glass slates that you can't see through but you can see shadows as people walk by.  Each of the 5-7 rooms are very big and clean.  The door slides shut but does not have a traditional lock but instead has a switch you flip to lock it.....but the door does not actually touch the wall!  There is a tiny gap between the two, not that anyone can see you, but it's still a little intimidating.  Either way, we had a good time and did lots of people watching.  Ages ranged from just legal, all the way to men in their 50s."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here!! NOTE: Thursday nite is a great nite to come here- the have a special sushi menu with crazy good prices. I couldn't believe they were giving 1$ prices for amazing sashimi!! There were some specialty rolls for 6$ that they normally charge 13$ for. They were both great! The sashimi was really good quality as well.   We also ended out getting a bottle of wine for only 15$. This is the price if you order it before 8PM. We also had a naan appetizer with some dips. It was relatively good. Also on the ok side was the Singapore noodles dish. It was almost too big even for sharing and not so great (but not terrible). It was a bit too salty and could have had some other flavors.   The eggplant dish we had was fantastic though! We really enjoyed it!  Ambiance is excellent here. Very trendy/modern. This is definitely a well put-together place!  The service was top notch as well. All around great place to come to either for a romantic date or with a big group. I'd say this is a great choice on Thursday nites as well. We got a great deal!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a waterfall flanked by several gold fish filled TV's hanging from the ceiling, and that's just the bar. Understated is certainly not the name of the game at Spice Route; whether it be the kitschy pottery barn candle holders or the giant back lit skulls framing the walls. Though I was briefly taken by the matchy matchy decor it was our warm friendly hostess and ultra professional waiter that bumped the restaurant up a couple of stars. Instead of ordering a couple of overwhelming entrees, we decided to peruse a few of the tasty appetizers. On recommendation of the waiter we started with the spiced Indian dips, dim sum platter and the meat eater of the group dove head first into the duck and salad wraps. Though as a vegetarian I did not sample the wraps, the tiny perfectly shaped lettuce wrappers were adorable so I approve. The dips and the dim sum were flavorful and came quickly. Accompanied by our starters the shared pad Thai was quick to follow. Both sweet and sour the pad Thai became one of my flavor faves of the evening. Filled with both generous helpings of tiger shrimp tofu and chicken (on the side) this dish was frankly the only one close in worth to its high price tag. Overall I feel that the prices reflected more the ambiance and professional nature of the wait staff rather than the quantity of the food. However the quality of the dishes was fantastic and almost worth the hefty price tag. As a side note, I learned an important lesson that when the waiter asks if you would like still or sparkling water at your table, this does not include a pitcher of cold tap water, but rather a pretentious exorbitantly expensive Perrier wannabe. Next time I'll know better though...Bottom line definitely worth another visit, earlier the better and bring your best Buddha belly."}
{"text":"If you like over the top cheesy neon coloured lighting, over-priced sweet cocktails that don't taste like they have booze in them and very average food then you'll be happy here.  I kind of felt like I was walking on to the set of an Ed Hardy commercial except it was dead in there."}
{"text":"I went there last Friday for dinner and drinks. My party decided to get a bunch of appies to share. Our waiter helped us with the wine...bad choice...it tasted like ice wine.  I love the decor of the place and the bathrooms are gorgeous... as for the food.  dynamite roll- yummy hand roll- yummy Thai vegetable curry- not very curryish rock cooked strip-loin- yummy yummy beef carpacio- left a lot to be desired"}
{"text":"Though the selection is very very slim (and I assume on rotation) spice route has offered some of the best maki sushi I have ever had. And I know sushi. The remaining fusion cuisine items are relatively common place, though. The restaurant setup is also strangely open concept, maybe because it sometimes doubles as a club after hours, but it can make for an odd dining experience."}
{"text":"Spcie Route has a chic mysterious vibe to it. I've been passing this place on King Street for years and never knew what it was. There are no signs inside or outside indicating what this place is. With it's big ominous looking wooden doors and the 8 ft fence around the patio, it immediately gives you the \"exclusive\" vibe.  Not typically my kind of place or crowd, we came here for a friend's birthday. Unfortuantely our friend was late so we had to stand around waiting in front of the bar. They have a policy of not seating you at your reserved table until half of the party has shown up...   Spice Route has an extensive list of mediocre beers and wines and a full bar. We were there around 10pm so I didn't get to try any of the food but I was told the shrimp and calamary were tasty, although a little too spicy and salty.  We didn't have any problems with services. Our waiter was attentive and came by fairly frenquently to check on us. Since I was going to leave before the rest of the group, I asked for a seperate bill ahead of time and had no issues with that. However, the music was way, way too loud for a restaurant/lounge. We were a table of 10 and I could barely hear the person across the table. Not only was it loud but it was terrible music (loud mellow club beats).  I was more disatisfied with the the patrons than with the actual restaurant atmosphere and music. This is where to come to pick up some scarby-barbies or a sweaty greasy rich guy. The crowd is a little older than average and the vast majority reak of desperation.  If you're looking for the dress to impress crowd that wants to pay way more than necessary for average food while being hit on by a cougar or desperate 50 year old greasy stock broker, this is your Shangri-la."}
{"text":"The only reason for the 2 stars is because of the food. I went there yesterday and I embraced the Summerlicious lunch menu. I have to admit, it was absolutely delicious. I had the Calamari (amazing), then the Mongolian Beef and to top it off, the Tempura Bananas - amazing. I always love the decor at this venue as well.  Now to the complaints:  -- The waitress was a self righteous bitch. She felt she was above us and when we asked her to correct something, she gave attitude and walked away. - after looking around you can really get a sense of the people hired to waitress here - model wannabes who lack any sort of acceptable service standards  -- The portions weren't even close to being equal. Three of my friends ordered the Lemon Chicken (don't get me wrong.. it was delicious) - and one of them was ripped off. Her portion was the size of one fist while the other two received portions twice the size.. no joke. I also received 4 pieces of calamari and she received 3 pieces.  -- It's too bad this place can't get it together, no matter how hard they try.. maybe they should focus less on the leather ottomans and more on the service staff, and their consistency.   Summerlicious here = good Everything else = Bad"}
{"text":"There are definitely some solid food items: Peking duck lettuce wrap, wasabi-crusted shrimps, Kobe carpaccio, and oh of course the saki-tini and lychee martini.   But really, it is the exotic interiors that will catch your eye (decor is probably the most impressive jewel of King West), and then the glass-walled bathrooms will take your breath away.   Great place to lounge together as a group."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is where you pee.    With that being said, let's get to the review. When you enter this place, you are quite stunned. The ambience is beautiful. The layout is great and the furnishings make this place look fantastic.  It ends there.  The food is atrocious. I ordered the pad Thai. It tasted like tough noodles in ketchup. It had shreds of...meat? I don't even know what that was. I had to literally force myself to get halfway through so I didn't feel like I wasted my money completely. My wife ordered the crispy calamari salad. She was disappointed and did one of those, \"ew, this is disgusting, try it!\" Things. No thanks, based on soggy leaves alone.  Spice Route gives me appreciation for that saying that a restaurant can look nice, but if the food sucks, forget it. That's Spice Route in a nutshell. Great looking place, make sure you have to go to the washroom, but don't come in hungry or you'll be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"i dont mind this place! The food is good (sure you can get the same stuff on spadina for way less) but they do good food here (cantonese chow mein, lemon chicken and pretty much all the apps are my go-to's)  The servers are always prompt and courteous.  The patio is really pretty.  Unlike most people, I don't like the bathroom. Sure it's unique but the lighting in there is so dim, I have no freaking idea what I look like when I just want to touch up my lipstick or check for mascara smudge under my eyes."}
{"text":"During my first visit to Spice Route, I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the food. The music was perfect background music that was energetic without being distracting. Service was good, and so were the many many martinis we ordered (ie: lychee). The food was pretty great too. 8 out of 8 dishes honestly tasted great. My only complaint is that there was no complimentary anything, even though I attended with 10 others for a birthday. It would have been nice if we had received either an app or dessert free of charge for our birthday girl or for the table."}
{"text":"This is just a rating for ambiance and drinks as I did not have the FOOD  First Impression: Ugggh. its a Club... Second Impression: O good new cover Third Impression: Shiny Lights, Uni Sex bathrooms Forth Impression: Still a club with the Shiny People and not my ideal place, but not terrible for what it is."}
{"text":"We brought two parties of about 10 to Spice Route for cocktails and dinner last night and had a GREAT experience. Kristin, our bartender, was extremely friendly and very efficient.The floor staff managed to combine our parties and deliver us a private room for 20.  We did a tasting menu with 14 or 15 dishes, ranging from apps to dessert. It was totally Pan Asian, and I did not see a culinary link to the Near East. The food was all fresh and well prepared, and modestly flavorful for less adventurous palates. Highlights for me included the coconut encrusted calamari, baby bok choy and kobe beef cooked on a hot stone at the table.  We had dessert outside in the courtyard. The cheesecake lollipop and lemon grass creme brulee were top notch."}
{"text":"Lots of choices but none of them are done very well. Food is expensive but none of it is that authentic or exotic. Waitresses look like Spa attendants and it seems like a club that serves food.  If the lights were on at full power you would see that this is a big concrete block box that should be in Suburbia."}
{"text":"Been there twice.   Honestly, the place looks very nice. Great atmosphere to hang out in a large group (at the patio) along very classy interior decor. For the patio I would highly recommend reservations but I would only recommend this place if you only want drinks or if you have *nowhere* else to go.   The place look almost like a postcard of what a Westerner would think an Asian themed restaurant should look like. So authentic this place is not.     The service is so-so and is the food authentic? Heck no. Calling the Spice Route authentic would be like calling Mandarin Buffet authentic Chinese food. Or Spring Rolls for that matter. It's passable fusion at best. Mediocre at worst.   The patio is nice for larger groups and drinks and by that I mean simple drinks. Not the proverbial \"girly drinks\" as my friends who had a few thought they were overpriced for the quality. However I would not eat here unless I had no choice. Which reminds me, the last time I was there was because I had a party too large to fit at the Brant House and we tried to make the party work here. Unfortunately it did not so we ended up at a club instead."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Spice Route. The decor in this place is just beautiful, the food is pretty good (although I didn't have much), the drinks are great (had plenty of that), and the music is also bumping. Now, my review is a weekday review, so I can't speak for the weekend crowd.   We happened to stumble upon this place while we were walking in the neighborhood during the day time. Little did we know that Spice Route was literally around the corner from our place. As soon as we walked in, I was in love with the music. The dj was playing some drum and bass vocal remixes which is good for a low key night. There were tons of places to sit, including some comfy leather couches indoors and cabana-type seating on the outdoor patio.   My boyfriend and I took a seat at the bar to start. The bartender was very nice and personable. He made sure to let us know that last call for the kitchen was about 5 minutes away and if we had anything in mind, that we should get our orders in ASAP. We ordered the tempura calamari and rock shrimp, as well as some drinks.   The food that we had was pretty awesome. It tasted almost as if the tempura batter had a bit of five spice in it. The rock shrimp was hugeee and tasted super fresh and yummy. The drinks were good too. I tried a couple of the Asian-inspired cocktails (lychee drinks). They were good, but nothing overly strong.   Halfway through, we decided to sit in the cabanas outside. A waiter made sure to always circulate around and make sure that we were being topped up. They're also quick to clean up after your empties.   Overall, I really liked this place. Drink prices were pretty reasonable and I was pretty happy with the food that I got and how much I paid for it. I'll have to come back on a weekend to see what the crowd is like, but on a Thursday, this place is more than A-OK."}
{"text":"Love this place - all around good food drinks and vibes. My fav go to is the orange spicy beef!"}
{"text":"This review is for the late night bar, not for the food or restaurant part.   Service at the bar was non existent, the place wasn't even that full but the bartenders didn't even look up for requests.  The place was half empty with a very large room full of empty tables (so it was nice that we could sit any where) but there were absolutely no servers.  The drinks were actually pretty good, but it was just a bit of a weird feel, like i was hanging out in somebody's loft.  We could have just walked in and sat at a table for hours and not even ordered anything and nobody would have even noticed (we sat at the bar for 10 min before we were able to force somebody to take or drink order). So if you're looking for a place just to chill with friends and be able to talk but have to work hard to order a drink, this place isn't so bad.  They have some nice fruity drinks."}
{"text":"This place has been going down hill.   The staff aren't as well trained anymore and the food are mediocre.  Most of the washroom doors are depolarized and doesn't even lock.  They have a all you can eat Sunday for $24.99, the menu choice is okay;  if you live in Toronto, you'll have many other better options for Asian fusion food.  If you're a tourist, it doesn't hurt to give it a try."}
{"text":"I don't know why the general consensus of Spice Route tend to be on the negative side, but I had an AMAZING time here last night.  My journey with Spice Route actually began a week ago, when I made online reservations via Open Table. My guest of honour, a VIP in my life, \"Prince Wills\" couldn't make it  until after 8PM and the only option on the database was 8PM. So I selected it and under the comments, I asked if I could have a table near 8:45PM or 9PM instead. I followed up with a phone call to the resto-lounge itself and left the same message inquiring about a 9PM dinner RSVP for 2. They promptly called me back and told me that a table would be ready for me at my prefered time. The Spice Route rep had to manually slot me in, but she still made it happen!   Fast forward to this week, I made several telephone inquiries with the restaurant itself in order to prep for my dinner for my friend. I wanted things PERFECT because 1) He's TRES important, 2) it's his silver birthday pre-celebration. Each time I called with questions, I was greeted with the utmost respect and recieved a satisfactory answer.   My first inquiry was about a birthday dessert. I wanted to bring one in and I wanted to know if they would hold outside food for me and serve it after dinner, cos it's a special occasion. They told me they would, with a $3 plate fee per person because they have desserts. But they said I could pre-order dessert and they would bring it out after dinner.  I wanted to bring in a special tiramisu, but then I decided to go for their \"lollipop cheese cake.\" I also requested that they write \"Happy Birthday William\" in full for me. The rep suggested \"Happy 25th Birthday William\" and I agreed -even better.   My second inquiry was if we could be seated at a prettier place in the restaurant because I wanted my friend to have a splendid dining experience for his birthday. The rep  made a note of it with my reservation, and said the hostess will see it upon my arrival and will do her best.  My last was about parking. I hate parking downtown, but I was going to dress up, and decided I'm  going to be too pretty for the TTC. The rep told me that they have parking around the restaurant and at a lot by Starbucks. Perfect answer.   Rewind to last night:   I came in to the resto-lounge at 9PM after searching forever for parking on King St. W. The hostess took me to my table but I didn't like it and asked for one of their big squared booths, because it was more spacious and had a pretty background. She gave me the booth as I asked.   While I was waiting for Prince Wills to arrive, the server brought me menus to look at and when I asked for water and lemon, he returned with 2 glasses of water and a cup full of lemons and lime.  When my guest of honor arrived, we ordered drinks, he had  Tiger beer and I had a Pinot Grigio. While we were looking through the menu, the waiter brought over 2 sweet buns with dipping sauce, compliments of the house!  What we ordered:  The Dim Sum Platter -We picked this appetizer coz it was the only one that had something we both could have. The veggie dumplings were ok, nothing spectacular. I think the ones Scarborough and Markham taste better, they're bigger too. My friend said the shrimp siu mais were ok, I'll take his word for it.   The Mushroom Efoo Noodle Soup (Pot) -a simple broth with mushroom and efoo noodles. The waiter told us that every plate is meant for sharing, so we shared the soup, after the server split the soup into 2 smaller bowls for us.   The Seared Rare Yellow Fin Tuna -This took the longest and my friend kept wondering why it took them that long to sear a tuna. But when it came, he said it was very good, better than he expected.   The Bday Dessert -came after dinner -as planned. It came with a lit candle and had \"Happy Birthday William\" written on the plate in full. They missed the 25th part, but it's ok, the message came across.  We had a really good time here.  I'm not sure why people say the service sucks, coz it was excellent. The staff was kind, attentive and satisfied ALL of my requests. The waiter even listened when I secretly told him to hold the bill until I came back from the washroom -Prince Wills' money is no-good when it's my party for him. My friend seemed happy last night, about the food, the ambiance, service, etc.... and that's all that matters to me."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars for the gorgeous atmosphere and ambiance. It's also very spacious with good seating for large groups and also a separate area that is great for dates. My friends and I went here pretty much because of the images online of the interior, and assumed that the food would be as good as the decor. Definitely not the case. The food was okay but some things tasted similar to frozen food from the grocery store, to be honest. The servers were slightly stuck up and seemed extremely annoyed when we asked for the bill to be split between us."}
{"text":"The decor is very nice inside, very trendy and hip.  The place is very big inside yet they created some areas as a lounge with pillows and curtains and very cozy looking.    We went there for one of my best friend's birthday and she loves this place.  We did make reservation as it was a surprise birthday for her and when we got there around 6:30pm, the place was pretty dead but just within an hour the whole place was filled.    The food is very westernized.  The best tasting thing on the menu was the sweet potato fries it was the best I have ever had anywhere in my life.  Very chunky and fatty tasting and goooooood.  Compared to real Chinese food, this place fails with their attempts on Cantonese Chow Mein and stir fry vegetables but when you go to Spice Route, you are going for the decor and trendy atmosphere.    In conclusion, it's not a place I would go for food or drinks as my choice but somewhere I would go if a friend decides to hosts an event there."}
{"text":"Ah Spice Route... After having read many mixed reviews I thought I would give it a try and judge for myself. The verdict - yet another pretentious \"fine dining\" Chinese restaurant that has been sent to the dog house along with Lai Toh Heen. They overcompensate for the plain Jane food offerings with overembellishing on the decor.  At Spice Route, bull is to china shop, as food is to decor. The decor was \"taste\"-ful. The food, not so much.   I had gone last night for their Chinese New Year's Eve party featuring a special Prix Fixe menu and lion dancing. We were seated promptly, however, it was about 10 minutes before anyone bothered to come take down our drinks. I had a lychee martini and it was very tasty. Not too dry and the lychees added just enough sweetness to balance out the alcohol.   The Prix Fixe menu offered the following items: Dim Sum Platter Mongolian Beef Eggplant Stir-Fry Roast Chicken with Glutinous Rice Sweet and Sour Cod Efu Noodles Dessert Trio  The lion dancing was very festive but after the second and third time around it became overkill. They didn't change up the beat of the drumming much so it became a series of  \"been there done that\" performances.  The food came out at a snail's pace with little explanation of what they were. It was like a cookie cutter dining experience with mass production being the name if the game. By the time the dim sum platter came my stomach was drumming along with the lion dancing. The platter was cold. The dumpling wrappers were thick and the filling was nothing extraordinary. One was a spinach dumpling, the other was a shrimp and pork wonton. Both epic failures.  Secondly came the Mongolian beef. It was screaming \"I have been overly tenderized with baking soda.\"  I think that the flank beef would've faired better if it were sliced thinner... it would've been naturally more tender.  The beef, albeit it being artificially infused with \"tenderness\" was very tender.  I found the level of spiciness to be too overpowering.  All you could taste was the burning sensation of the chillies and not much else.  The broccoli was nice and crunchy.    Next up, we had a black bean eggplant stir-fry.  I always have a soft spot for Chinese eggplant as I love the buttery texture of it compared to its ItalItalian counterparts.  The flavours of the eggplant were very delicate.  The red peppers were a great foil to the eggplant as the sweetness and crunchiness enhance the buttery texture of the eggplant while offsetting the denseness of the black bean sauce.  The sweetness of the red pepper also balances the saltiness of the black bean sauce.  The chicken skin was very crisp and the meat itself was surprisingly flavourful, I only wish the same could be said about the giant white mass of glutinous rice that accompanied the dish, only serving as a filler.  It was horrible.  Bland and undercooked.  I thought that the banana leaf that lay underneath the rice would really serve to bring out a tea-ish flavour, but alas, it was all for show as it was dry and cold.  Even having steamed the rice with chicken broth would've given it a subtle flavour!  I won't even be so greedy as to ask for chinese sausage or dried shrimp.  That might be asking too much of Spice Route.  The efu noodles were pretty standard and didn't really stand out, a bit oily, but after the bland rice we were served... Anything would've tasted heavenly!  The cod was quite flaky, but you could definitely tell it was made from frozen fish and not fresh.  The fish skin was very crispy, emulating those that you would find at a Chiu Chow eatery... Think, flavour-infused potato chip! The batter was nice a light, but again, too oily for my tastebuds.  So from a textural perspective, the dish was great, from a flavouring perspective, it tasted like french fries with ketchup and there ain't anything Chinese about that!  And that takes us right to dessert.  All that it said on the menu was \"Chef's Trio Dessert Sampler.\"  During dinner I had asked what everyone thought would be on the menu, and someone said \"I bet you there will be a fortune cookie!\" And sure enough - there was a massive fortune cookie as part of the three.  The trio consisted of: Deep Fried Banana in a Chocolate Sauce, Chocolate Brownie with Mandarine Oranges and Orange Crème (think CreamSaver candy), and the \"OMG-that's-so-big\" fortune cookie.  Of the 3, the deep fried banana was definitely the crowning achievement.  The bananas were not overly ripe, but mushy enough to fuse with the crispy batter to create a gastronomic epiphany in my mouth.  The fortune cookie was very airy, crisp and light with a hint of vanilla and butter flavour.  Think of a pizzelle but ten times the size.

{"text":"Spice route has a relaxing ambiance that makes it a worthwhile place to seek out for dinner and drinks.  Some menu items I found overpriced--$12.00 for 3 tiny crab cakes??!!! While others were more reasonable--such as the noodle and rice dishes.  The 5 spice fried fish was exceptional but for $22.00 rather small.  When we arrived around 7pm the place was pretty empty but by 8:30 was hopping.  Our server Hernand was very accommodating."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, overpriced chinese food.   However, in the summertime, the patio is amazing. And my favourite is their Sangria.  That's about it.   We went once just for drinks, and unfortunately their lounge area is small, and wish they gave more non reservation room."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service, but the food needs improvement in the taste department. I give them A+ for effort on the variety of fusion dishes and presentation. Peaking duck, sushi, hot stone steak, chow mien! Just wish the taste was there to back it up. Will probably take a date here for a few drinks though. The place is nice and pretty!"}
{"text":"After specifically asking our server to space our courses out, our mains appeared almost on top of the apps. Our wine appeared after our mains. We ordered as one of our mains the \"Clay Pot Lobster\" special. It arrived in an aluminum bowl... \"well we just call it that\". It was apparent that the Chef had taken a meat cleaver to a Lobster and put it in a stew. Hence the stew was littered with shards from the shell making it almost inedible. The rest of the mains were just OK They tell you that the mains are meant to be shared family style, but their presentation really doesn't lend itself to do so. Brownie and Cheesecake desert were good, but not nearly enough to pull the meal out of the disappointing category. Vibe was cool, room is nice, maybe go for some apps and hangout, maybe. Too many other choices in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is both pretty inside and out. There are torches in front and it looks like the entrance to some castle in Asia. I came here with a friend last night for their Chinese New Year's event and had a really good time.   For $65, you get a myriad of courses serving Chinese dishes to bring in the New Year. Now is it authentic? Who knows. The Xiu Mai was really good. One set had shrimp in it (meh) and the other had bok choy (delish). There was a spicy eggplant dish with black bean and peppers, which I found to be another favourite of mine as well.   I was a tad iffy when I read some reviews mentioning their crap service. Luckily, 'James V' was our server and I found it be excellent. He came to our table often with water or to ask if there was anything else we needed.   The overall experience was a 5 because the decor inside is really nice, the drinks are good (and reasonable for Toronto) , and the Chinese dragon (? ... it maybe have been a bunny, fish, cat or a melange of all four) dancing/presentation. However, I found the food to be quite mediocre considering the prices they were charging, which brings my review down to 3.   I'm not going to sneak out of work today to go indulge in some Spice Route cuisine, but I'm also not going to make up some lame excuse if someone invited me to go."}
{"text":"Over all the experience was a \"meh.\"  I went here for a friend who was celebrating her birthday, we had made reservations to ensure we would not run in to any issues being seated since it was a Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 9, I understand running a few minutes behind and making someone wait to be seated, but we were not sat until 9:45-9:50. We were forced to wait at the bar, however since it was a Saturday there was no seats free, we were forced to stand.  When we were sat the other people in the party decided to order a bottle of wine. The waiter, who was some what attentive but also very slow offered one, but did not inform us of the price. When we got the bill, we seen that it was $65.00, and we had two of them. I don't drink wine, so the others were stuck with the bill, but still, $65.00 for an OK bottle of Red is rediculous.  I ordered the Pad Thai and my friends ordered about 4 apps. My Pad Thai was very spicy. I've ordered many pad thai's and never ran into one being spicy. Another dish a friend ordered was some beef dish. She has had it numerous times and it was so spicy she sent it back. She stated its never normally spicy, so I am guessing the chef went spice crazy that night.  The whole meal experience took nearly two hours, and we maybe seen the waiter three time (2 of them to sell us wine.) Service was lacking, we were sat way late and the food was sub par. A bill for 4 apps 2 bottles of wine and 1 pad thai came to $300.00.   Save your money and go else where."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my friend.  The server was very kind and accomodating.  We ordered a bunch of things to share which includes the pork potstickers, crab cakes, and the wok seared teriyaki sirloin. They also gave us complimentary sweet buns. The food was average (crab cakes was over cooked and the potstickers were ok) Aside from the food, it was a very nice atmosphere  with lots of people and music.  My only other criticism is that it was very loud and dark when we were eating. This made is very difficult to see what we were eating/reading the menu and even hear the person across the table."}
{"text":"The music was too loud, the food was not good : we had the pad Thai and the chow mein, both were pretty bad (not well cooked, too much sauce...). To avoid !"}
{"text":"We were trying to find some dinner on a Thursday night last week and finally settled on Spice Route.  The service and atmosphere at Spice Route are excellent.  Staff are friendly and always very attentive to your needs like making sure your glass is always filled with sake. ;-)  It was the $2 nigiri sushi & maki roll special that night and we were more than happy to hear.  The sushi is better than your run-of-the-mill sushi shops and also they seemed like larger portions too.  I really liked that they lightly blow-torched the red and white tuna nigiri so that the fat just ever so slightly melts and makes for a tastier experience.  We ordered a plethora of nigiri sushi and maki rolls to fill our tummies.  Settled on a bottle of sake between the two of us and I think that is the best value for money on the drinks menu.  They only serve their sake chilled btw.  Overall, a very pleasurable experience. :-)"}
{"text":"Fun place....great food. I love the washrooms! Trendy and spacious place on King St. Everything was great and the manager Shane came up to us and was great and even bought us a shot...great place to start a night out!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Mind you its been a few years since I've been there.  I loved the look of the place, the food was good.  I would totally go back."}
{"text":"In love with Spice Route! The ambiance is truly amazing and so romantic! The food is a whimsical Asian fusion and the presentation adds to the overall experience. Service was not fabulous but the food and atmosphere made up of it. Was there with coworkers but will definitely be back for a date night!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend;s birthday, we were a large party of about 10.  First off, this place is BEAUTIFUL. It's one of those spots you go just to be seen.   The seating area was really nice, and the patio was FREAKING AMAZING. Hands down one of the best patios in the city. The seating is intertwined with a koi pond! With real Koi..  And the washrooms are reaaaaaaaaaaaallly nice.  We came here on wednesday, which they had 1 dollar sushi special! So cheap, and affordable.  The standouts were definitely the volcana roll and the red hot! Served beautifully.  We also tried the:  1. Tempura Calamari and Rock Shrimp - the calamari was kinda inedible, and the rock shrimp was great. Kinda underwhelming.  2. Spicy Indian Curried Tigerr Prawns Claypot = this was HUGE. Defo meant for sharing. But I think it was a bit too bland.  3. Miso Glazed Black Cod - THIS WAS DELICIOUS. Everything. Even the shiitake's. Defo some of the best cod.   4. Mongolian Sirloin Beef - this was delicious, even tohugh I think the portion was super tiny.  5. Red Ginger Tea - I liked it, my friends weren't a fan.   Sidenote: They did tell us that service would be super slow that night because of the sushi deal, and it was. Took over an hour and a half for our food to arrive.   I heard they also turn into a hip and happening club in tthe night, but I didn't stay for that.  Final Notes:  I liked this place, but the food wasn't the best. It's beautiful, and definitely a fun place to be. I'll defo be back."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on service, as we did not even get a chance to sit down at eat our meal! The service is truly terribly, if you don't enjoy pretentious venues, avoid this place for sure.   After walking around the King W area, I spotted out Spice Route as a cool venue to have a bday dinner. First clue that this place is a bit much is for the life of me I couldnt find a sign or street number indicating WHAT is what the place is named. Short of going inside and asking, I'm not sure how you would know.   I made a reservation a week in advance for a booth table at 9pm (they were booked for earlier reservations) When we actually went there, they refused to seat my party until ALL guests arrived. I mean, what dinner party have you been to where all 8-10 guests arrive at the same time? They offered me a smaller table, even though there was more than one large booth available at that time. When I explained the rest of my guests would arrive soon but would likely just have drinks, they again insisted that I could only have a small table for the people eating and the others would have to sit at the bar.  I ended up asking to speak to the manager, which did not help. He suggested we 'didnt get out enough' if we have never heard of a entire party having to arrive to be seated.   The thing is, the place wasnt that busy, they could of facilitated my original reservation. But they were just so uppity about it, plus the suggestion we were not civilized enough to follow their rules was too much.   My friends told me later that they've been to Spice Route in the past, and albeit the ambience is cool, the food is average. We ended up heading to Fynn's of Temple Bar right beside it. Ok it wasn't as fancy, but definitely a relaxed place and a decent meal! I'd recommend it over Spice Route any day!"}
{"text":"Meh, is really the only word that comes to mind when I think of this place. I mean the only reason it's getting any sort of star rating is because I really enjoy the decor, well aside from the gigantic skulls and bones canvases on the walls.  It's got a great feel for after work drinks or just to hang out but if you are seriously considering coming here for food, think twice. Now I know I have a skewed view as I myself am of the Asian decent and have been exposed to many authentic and copycat restaurants, but let me tell you from my perspective this place is definitely not good.   I looked at everything from an outsiders perspective as I try to do in Asian cuisine, would someone who has never had Asian food like it? Will the decor/ambiance override the quality of food? etc... I have to say that the quality of the food is subpar. I mean it's obviously better than say...Manchu Wok but I think it ends there... The reason this place is still thriving? After work drinks and the suburban folk that come down and \"try hard\" to be with the downtown crowd, \"Oooh let's go to Spice Route, that's where all the Ad execs go to let loose after work!\"  One thing that really stands out in my mind are the bathrooms. They are massive and open and close with a large wooden sliding door, this makes me nervous on a few levels, these doors are notorious for not locking properly and if you're a little more sauced, you may not even get the door shut to lock it. The back wall is a huge glass window that looks out onto their garden, which I'm told is beautiful in the summer and it is like you are peeing in the great outdoors. Frankly, I'm just nervous if the gardener is doing some maintenance that he'll see more than he bargained for.  But again, this place is thriving because...location, location, location. It is surrounded by marketing and ad agencies that need places to go for after work drinks and/or client meetings. But on the weekends it's pure suburban wannabes. If you are going to try the food, I'd highly recommend that you don't and just go for the flare of peeing outdoors and the ambiance of the decor and more mature crowd."}
{"text":"Another uber hip and trendy bar in King West has opened its doors and its name is Spice Route.   I've been here a couple to times but to be honest, I've never been overly impressed. They obviously spent a ton of money on the decor - flaming candles, exotic door way and huge ass patio with plush seating.   One time I went here for drinks with some friends and the service was TERRIBLE. She came to our table once and never came back to get our drink orders again. The place was packed with your typical crowd of uber trendy working types and college kids that frequent the many bars on the King West strip.   The restaurant itself is really nice - lots of space, tons of seating, great lighting. The menu features a ton of Asian fusion dishes that I have yet to taste.    I wasn't overly impressed with Spice Route. Besides its flashy decor, it doesn't have much to offer in the way of ambiance or service and certainly won't be patronizing the establishment again any time soon."}
{"text":"Two words: lemon chicken.   Usually the service is 10/10 here, our last visit it was alright. The bartender also didn't know what a peach Bellini was. The food is above average except for the lemon chicken. It's delicious! This place gets super packed in the evenings, so make a reservation or you'll regret it!"}
{"text":"Someone had told me this place was similar to Tao (Vegas/NYC) and the atmosphere in the restaurant does have a bit of that Tao vibe.  Unfortunately the food didn't match up with the setting.  We ordered kung pao chicken, a thai curry and the veg tempura, and every dish lacked spice or seasoning.  Also, the food was cold, so it probably sat around for a while before it was brought to our table.  The decor deserves a couple of stars but not the food."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying out some delicious fusion food during Winterlicious at Spice Route. Unfortunately, I was let down by almost every course that I had while dining here.   For the appetizer, I initially started with the Shanghai edamame salad, thinking it was an actual salad with edamame beans with some salt and taro chips on the side. To my dismay, what I ended up getting was a pile of edamame beans, some salt in the middle and some chips on the side - that was my \"salad\". I thought that there was a mistake on my order but it wasn't the case. I ended up getting a different appetizer instead - the ginger chicken and vegetable soup. The soup itself was nothing special - it tasted very much like a generic buffet style soup that you would get at Mandarin.   For the main, I had the Mongolian sirloin beef. When it comes to Asian-style meat dishes, you need to have some rice or noodles on the side to balance out the rich flavours of the dish. I found the Mongolian beef too salty for my liking so I ordered some rice on the side. The rice took about twenty minutes to arrive at our table. By the time the rice arrived (a \"small\" side of rice in a bamboo container that would actually make 2-3 servings) I was already almost finished eating my dish since I was so hungry.   Thankfully, dessert wasn't too bad - I had the spiced chocolate molten cake. I cut the cake down the middle to see if any chocolate poured out - nothing came out. Just some mushed up chocolate on the inside. Nonetheless, I actually really enjoyed the cake. I like how the cardamom cream gave the chocolate molten cake an exotic touch and the coconut macaroon helped to balance out the rich taste of the cake.   I would have given Spice Route a 1 star if it weren't for the service. Our server was really polite and understanding despite the fact that I had to send back a dish (which I rarely ever do). The runners were a bit neglectful at times - my friend didn't have her appetizer dish taken away until she was done her main.   Overall, the food during Winterlicious was a letdown - there were misleading and questionable dishes (my friend's green tea panna cotta seemed too ambitious and included mango salsa and taro chips...an odd combination with something so sweet and delicate like green tea panna cotta) and the food as a whole tasted like food from Mandarin. However, the service made up for the lacklustre food and the overall ambiance of Spice Route was sophisticated and lively. I would probably come back...but only for drinks."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try Spice Route out via their Summerlicious menu.  To be honest, I was not entirely sure I would enjoy the experience given what I'd read from previous Yelp reviews.   We were seated quickly and our waiter arrived with our menus almost immediately.  He took our drink order (Pitcher of Spiked Raspberry Iced Tea).  Our pitcher arrived within minutes of placing the order along with icy cold water, which was greatly appreciated.  After looking over the Summerlicious menu, we decided to order from their regular menu...not that the Summerlicious menu didn't look ok, it's just that I've learned from experience that when a restaurant strays from it's regular offerings in order to cobble together something that fits the Summerlicious formula (appetizer/entree/dessert) it usually turns out to be a hot mess. Again, I cannot say this enough, these restaurants should stay true to their roots and offer what they do best during Summerlicious.  In the end we ordered what seemed like a ton of food:  Kobe Beef Carpaccio  @  $16 - This was delicious, the meat was cut perfectly and the drizzle of sesame oil was a tasty surprise.  Serving size was good.  Spciy Duck and Chicken Lettuce Wraps @ $14 - All three of us loved this dish, although we thought they could have given us a few more lettuce leaves, overall, a good dish.  Crispy Peking Duck @ $22 - The duck was cooked perfectly, with a nice little crunch on the skin, only downside, the serving size was small.  Mussels @ $15 - The mussels were good, but I have to say that they were barely warm when they reached the table.  The broth was good, but could have had a bit more flavour, it was lacking a little something though hard to pinpoint what it needs, maybe a touch more garlic or ginger...just needed some heat.  Great portion size for the price.  Mongolian Beef @ $20 - This was another group favourite, very flavourful, you could really taste the ginger and the peppers - nice heat on this dish.  Portion size was really good for the price.  Sticky Rice @ $5 - I didn't have any of the rice, but my friends said it was good.  When we ordered it we had initially asked for 2 portions, but our server told us that 1 portion would be more than enough for the three of us and he was right, so thanks for that.  Cheesecake Lollipop @ $5 - Who doesn't like white chocolate, cream cheese and coconut rolled into a giant ball, drizzled with caramel and served on a lollipop stick?  Nuff said.  Tempura Banana @ $6 - This was the group's favourite.  It was hot, surrounded by chocolate sauce, the bananas were a nice gooey, tasty filling in a nicely cooked tempura.   Raspberry Chocolate Brownie @ $7.00 - Meh. Possibly the only real \"low light\" of the evening.  TWO Pitchers of Raspberry Spiked Tea @ $25/each. Ummm...yeah it was delcious!  Our server was great!  Our food was brought to the table quickly and we NEVER felt rushed.  We had that table for 2 1/2 hours and when he brought us the bill he even stated that there was \"no rush\".    Again, given what I had read in previous reviews, this is not the experience I expected.  Needless to say we were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"After reading lots of mixed reviews of Spice Route, we decided to play it safe and go on a Sunday evening for their $24 all you can eat special. After a lovely 3-hour meal, I have to say that I agree with most of the other reviews I have read. The restaurant itself is beautiful and it's worth going just to see the washrooms. The cocktails are good, especially the lychee martini.  Now the food, the food is hit and miss. We started with a plethora of appetizers (spring rolls, calamari, dim sums, etc) which were not any better than frozen ones from the grocery store (who knows, perhaps they were...). The main courses were much much better, especially the seafood ones (mussels, awesome). We also really enjoyed the Mongolian beef and the mini Kobe burgers. Surprisingly, the curry was bland with mushy vegetables (I didn't know it was possible to do a bad curry).  If you do go, I recommend sticking with seafood and meat dishes as opposed to appetizers  and rice and noodle dish. The Sunday special is certainly worth it, as everything comes in small portions so you can try everything? The service is great, attentive yet unobtrusive. And really, those washrooms."}
{"text":"We split the lemon chicken. It was okay. This place reminds me of a chain restaurant that uses frozen food. The drinks were horrible. The bartender took at least 20 mins to make our first drink and it had barely any alcohol in it. Mind you, there were a total of 15 ppl in the entire restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this place. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Great for drinks, horrible for dinner. 15 of us went for a birthday dinner on Saturday where we had the option of the regular menu or winterlicious menu. We also received bottle service. Firstly, the food is overpriced and horrible. Probably the worst food on King st. Secondly, the AC+Heaters/Air circulation is troubling, the restaurant is so unbelievably cold during dining hours you might as well wear your jacket hat and mits indoors. As soon as there is a larger crowd the place becomes unbearably hot/sticky.  Thirdly, my waiter made no efforts to assist me with my allergies, when i told him he made no efforts to confirm with the chef about any ingredients. The restaurant gets packed around 12:30 the music and cheap cocktails are the only good things this place has to offer."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Spice Route. This place easily wins for the coolest interior design of any restaurant I've ever been to in Toronto. Yes, torches outside, super cool feng shui décor inside. So my reason for coming here is because it was my birthday and I decided to book the Buddha room for about 13 people.   The Interior Design/Atmosphere The place is absolutely stunning, bead curtains, big comfy red velvet couches, rose pedals in the big table with smooth river rocks for detail. The couches made the atmosphere laid back but also fancy. Totally Buddha themed and I loved it.  The Food The food was actually incredible, moderately priced but full of flavour & great portions. I had some guests order pad thai, others ordered sushi, and I ordered the Chicken and vegetables dish. Every bite I had was phenomenal and everything I sampled was amazing. The onion rings were a big hit because they're massive! Great presentation of the food by the chef's and top notch plating.  The Service The service by most of the servers was good. I wouldn't say exceptional or anything out of the ordinary. However we did have one server who distinctly resembled \"Paris Hilton\" she was completely horrible and the only reason why this isn't a 5-star review. We asked her opinion on items before ordering and she had next to nothing to say, I had kindly advised her of two peanut allergies post ordering & she still brought out dishes with nuts on top. She kept forgetting what people ordered and coming back and forth with drinks forgetting drinks as well as who ordered what. She also billed us improperly. You have a note pad for a reason as a server, so use it. -_- Very frustrating and threw off the good vibes we had as a group. Trying to decipher the bill was a monstrosity because she charged us for drinks we never ordered.   Overall I would definitely come back. I would make sure Paris wasn't my waitress or I would literally request someone else.   :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually come on Thursdays for their $1 sushi. The sushi is always extremely fresh and is just as filling as an AYCE restaurant. So you definitely get your money's worth! The atmosphere is amazing and it's a beautiful restaurant too. The manager also always remembers us every time we come in. By far, my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"If I hadn't known this was the palce with the torches out front, I would have never found it.  I do not see an address or name on the front of the restaurant...maybe that's a sign of real success if they don't need that.  Once you get inside it's quite nice.  Modern, relaxing feel.  It's a little too big to really feel intimate, but still nice.  My favorite part is the washrooms.  (says a lot but I will get mroe into detail).  If you are there, make sure you go to the washrom to see what I mean.  There is a corridor of rooms, (washrooms), each one is private with a sliding door.  The sliding door has a magnetic lock so at first you try opening it up to make sure it actually locked...pretty cool though.  The best part of the washroom is that there is a floor to ceiling, wall to wall window overlooking a garden outside.   The food though, was not as iompressive as the washroom.  I have to admit that it was no better thatn thai express.  We were a party of 4 so ordered plenty of dishes.  It was tasty, but not overly impressive.  I would go back again, but for the atmosphere, (and washrooms), not just for the food."}
{"text":"On antibiotics and fighting a bacteria courtesy of Spice Route. I do not believe I need to say or add anything else to convince you otherwise. Restaurant has been warned of their kitchen standards. Food is nothing special really. And in case you are wondering, my immune system is very strong and I definitely have strong defenses, so for me to get this sick, the health standards must be of immense concern. Buyer be aware. Viviana."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday in early June to celebrate a friends b-day. Altogether there about 10 of us in a booth  Atmosphere I give this area of the restaurant 5 stars. They clearly want to give you that 'Oh, we're LA posh vibe', you might see the Khardasians while inside so be aware\" and they accomplished that. I like the bathrooms mostly. Instead of separate areas for the men vs women, it was a long hallway, with pocket doors that slid open, giving you really your own very separate bathroom experience. Your own toilet, your own sink, and your own floor to ceiling window next to the toilet to look out upon the outdoors, the fire/water feature, and sculpture. I actually really like that. There was a bathroom attendant (thank goodness, the rolling door got stuck halfway on me).  I did like being in a clearly young adults only place - no one ws going to bring their baby here, their crazy drunk frat brothers, or their old farting grandma. A nice date night place, but music is too loud for romantic talk.  Oh and we had invited  2 German friends on vaca who had on walking/street shoes and weren't allowed in. They ended up directly next door to the patio area Spice Route drinking nice cheap beer and food. I wish I had worn sneakers.....  Service Since I was there early before the hordes of people came (about 830p) Im sure I experienced better service from the hostesses and the bartenders where I got a pre-dinner beer. Our waiter, was blah. If it wasn't for her nice beard, I really would never have remembered him. None of the service was stellar, but it was all enough to not discourage me from returning. Oh, and for being such a 'posh' place, me being a girl in a cute outfit, I felt the bartender should have offered me a glass for my beer.  Food/Drinks Hmm, drinks, I only had bottled beer (Stella $7) and water so I can't judge on the drinks too much. They looked alright, the birthday girl's first drink was overly watery but then the rest were better poured. Food... sigh...Don't you hate when you're so hungry, and you order what looks awesome, and your food not only comes out last, but it comes after everyone else's HUGE plates of food comes. Oh and to boot- your plate is filled with what you would feed a bird!? So, I ordered the surf & turf; a meal that anywhere means you should be getting a decent portion of food. It was Kobe beef & crab burgers w/ sweet potato fries $19 + tax. I ordered this after the server made sure to remark that the menu is meant for sharing. I was worried I might have order too much, but no problem, just take it home to my brother. My friend JF and I ordered the same thing, we wait, and wait. I'm thinking they must be making the Kobe beefr extra special. It comes out and my eyes water with tears of saddness as he present s me with 4 sliders - you know mini MINI burgers...That was it. 2 sliders were smalllll crab cakes, and 2 were smallllll Kobe beef burgers. I feel it is the duty of a server, when everyone else is ordering HUGE amounts of food, for you tosay, that 'hey FYI, the portions are not that big'. I ate, it tasted decent. The crab cakes were slightly the dry, and I think the awesome flavour of the Kobe beef (which I've never had but always heard about) was really corriander seasoning. So for MY meal, I give it 2 stars. Complete let down, in taste, looks, fullness of my belly. I did go home and snack.  Everyone elses meal, I give 4 stars just for smells and portion sizes.   Bang for my Buck? Nope! But if I do go back, I would not order what I had again. $19+tax for 4 sliders and 8 maybe 10 nicely sized sweet potato fries (they were the best part of my meal) is NOT worth it. If your hungry ask your server to be sure, but order anything else but what I ordered."}
{"text":"it's not a club and the music is too loud to hold a conversation? the food is not good, place is a let down."}
{"text":"Oh, the good and the bad.  First the bad....don't get caught checking out the waitress. It will probably ruin your night. Now to get one thing straight I did smash my head open earlier in the evening so I might have been suffering from a concussion that excuse didn't work but it is true. Lesson learned :(  We went on Sat night, a cold late December evening, I thought for sure being a Sat and prime dining time it would be packed. To my surprise the place was only 1/2 full on a Sat night at 8 PM.  The ambiance is second to none, the place is just wonderful, the bathrooms are one of a kind, I want to go back in the summer just to have a drink on the patio. The GF had a Lychee Martini and loved it, I'll admit I gave it a try and it was pretty good.  We did get a appetizer but a can't recollect (remember the head wound), we got the lemon glazed chicken (recommended by our server) and sticky rice. I thought the food was great.  I would go again 100%, perfect place for a date. Can't wait to check it out when the weather is nicer, maybe I'll make a trip this spring."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to visit  this restaurant twice in the last week . . . 1st on buisness, then with my husband and some friends. When I went with my associates, there was about 30 of us, I had a wonderful experience . . . we shared about 15, yes, 15 dishes on the menu. What stood out was the Wasabi Crusted Shrimp, Kobe beef that you cook yourself on a hot stone (I wasn't a fan at first, but it was incredible!), tasty Pad Thai,Peking Duck lettuce wraps (although no-one else I was near liked these, they found them too sweet but I think it was just the sauce) and also popular faves like orange chicken and sweet and sour pork as well as the lamb. The waiters seemed, well, very quiet and efficent. Maybe because we were such a big party they had a lot on their minds, not rude or anything just very down to buisness.   The atmosphere here was great, and, although it is such a small thing, I love love love that you can smell the candles they light in the whole restaurant, a small thing but it really made it seem welcoming and warm. If I hadn't been with someone who had previously been there I would have walked right by, as there is not really a visible sign, just a few torches. Wine list was fine, prices not too bad considering location and ambiance. All in the party were laughing all night and raving the next day . . . not easy to please that many people. However, I went a few days later with my husband and some friends and the service felt very, more like extremely rushed. We pretty much ordered the same things I have listed here, even though it was Winterlicious we did not order off that menu. I felt a little put off, almost like an assembly line and they were trying to get people out the door for the next patrons to arrive. Food was the same, waiters were the same.  We arrived at 6pm and were out the door at 6:45 . . . we ordered app's and main courses and wine. Kind of disappointing esp because our friends were looking forward to visiting Spice Route."}
{"text":"Celebrating our work after party, Spice Route is one of the most sought after social bars along King Street W.  The Asian inspired decor, and overall ambience is quite lovely.  With the main bar in the center of it all, the lay out of the place is well played.  After our work spring mingle, this was our go-to place for food and drinks.  The service was exceptional, however as the evening went on, it became extremely busy.   For drinks I kept it light with just Gin and tonic, however their food was quite innovative. With various appetizers; we had their sushi, edamame, asian inspired fajitas (made out of lettuce)."}
{"text":"Spice Route stands out on King Street with its mysterious flickering fire and castle-like wooden doors.  The natural and mystic decor  is unique and creates a mellow meeting atmosphere.   I've been to Spice Route three times.  The first time I went, they accommodated a group of ten of my friends for my birthday.  We arrived after dinner and ordered appetizers and drinks.  The service was excellent, the food delicious and the drink menu featured a section of original tea-based alcoholic beverages.   I'm always the first to try something new so we ordered few of their fruity flavours.  It was an interesting experience but they were quite weak in alcohol.  I also tried the chai chocolate tea which was pretty flavourful.  I noticed that the music was slowly getting louder throughout the night... I thought that was cool... but a dance floor never broke out.  And it never will.  The music was house or mellow lounge style; the crown was early to late thirties and did not appear approachable.  The second time I visited was to try their dinner menu... after meeting their head chef.  Everything I tried was delicious and unique; also, service was again prompt and frequent.  The third time I went had Suzie and I laughing over the terrible service... from mixing up both the food and drink orders and then getting the bill wrong... and taking forever for every correction... but it was her first day... apparently.  Overall, I would go to Spice Route again for an intimate dinner or date... but its not the crowd in which I'd try and meet somebody.  Haven't you heard of eHarmony?"}
{"text":"We got here and walk into a big dining room that resemble something that looks like a big dance floor with a bar in the middle. The decor wasn't too bad, as soon as you walked in, you could smell the spicy aroma. We had reservation but we still had to wait for about 20 mins. We finally got a table, but were told that there wasn't enough chairs, so we just ask for one from the next table ( I guess they couldn't do that for us).   The server was very friendly and got our orders promptly. Our food came very quickly and the service was pretty good(other than the chair part). We ordered the red snapper, black cod, kobe burger, mussels, tuna, kobe beef on Hot stone, calamari and the Peking duck.  The Kobe beef dishes was very good, and the black cod was amazing. However unfortunately the snapper and the mussels were not fresh at all and tasted exactly like they were left out in the summer sun before it was cooked.   Everything else was mediocre, the pricing was alright. The atmosphere was a mixed crowd, but the place was so loud it felt like we were in a club. Overall I would say I would give it 2.5 out of 5. Would I go back there for dinner? Probably not, but i wouldn't mind going back for drinks."}
{"text":"I had to write an update because i am absolutely in love with the food. i didn't give it enough credit last time. It's something out of this world. I actually crave it now. But, oh my god, the service is DISGUSTING... So sad.... My friends came in for a drink, they literally pushed them to order food because apparently you are not allowed to sit at the table if you're not eating ?? When me and my other friend came to join them, they basically gave us a speech how we were supposed to make a reservation if we wanted to sit... Waitress had major attitude problems, so did the hostess.. Like, i just don't get it? I know people constantly complain bout the service but nothing is being done.. I guess because it's such a hot spot and people go there anyway. 5 stars for food.... zero stars for service"}
{"text":"Had group dinner here for about 12 people on Thursday night.  Overall impression was that it was a solid meal, but nothing outstanding.  Service was slow (our waiter took us awhile to get us our drinks, and then made us wait even longer to put in our food order in order to take an additional drink order).  Drinks were nothing special.  The mojito I had, which my server raved about, was quite disappointing and laced with too much soda.  My subsequent rum and cokes tasted pretty much like coke.    The food is served tapas style, and it was easy enough to pass the plates around in our booth.  The vegetarian options were sadly pretty limited, so the lone vegetarian in our group was a little stiff.  Out of the other dishes we tried, the shrimp curry was probably the most standout.  All told, nobody was terribly disappointed -- but no one was particularly excited, either.  Not the reaction I was going for with so many out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"Horrible! We were visiting Toronto and a family member suggested we try this place. Very trendy and extremely snobby with terrible service. First they told us we could wait at the bar till a table was available, probably an hour. Place was barely half full. After settling at a table near the bar, we were directed there, the manager came by and told us there was no place for us available. One story at the front desk another from the manager. Meanwhile the place was still mostly empty and we were asked to leave. Didn't even smell good inside."}
{"text":"we had such a deliciously memorable experience at Spice Route.  to say we were well taken care of is understatement.  zengria, appetizers, and main app were excellent so I am highly recommending this resto-lounge as a must try for foodies. Check out my photos to view the tasty \"asian-fusion tapas\" we indulged in, i.e. complimentary sweet buns, sizzling hot stone steak, wasabi shrimp and lobster pad Thai.   p. s.  this review is based on a Friday late evening dinner experience. I note this because the atmosphere and perhaps dining experience may vary depending on the time and day you visit. this is only my first dinner with spice route and hope and expect it to be just as good in the future on a week night.  - Adrian was a wonderfully attentive,  resourceful and friendly server. food came out promptly (although the drinks not always so prompt). 4 star customer service -  thank you for all the wonderful appetizer and cocktail recommendations (I agree with the previous reviews that the lychee martini is delicious!) Everything was so flavourful! the fellow female servers and female hosts were also very helpful and welcoming.   Thanks to Tom the manager for the warm reception as well. I wish u a speedy recovery on your ACL!"}
{"text":"Spice Route is a trendy restaurant with an attitude....a BAD one!  The restaurant itself is beautifully done up inside, with Asian-themed decor, great use of seating space and a huge open area by the main bar for patrons to booze it up right and mingle.  I co-hosted my close friend's bachelorette party there this past weekend and it was a success!   The restaurant made it very easy when it came to making a reservation for a large group and after a quick seating request, they had a wonderful classy booth waiting for us when we arrived.  The food was really good in my opinion. For the 7 of us there for the dinner portion of the evening, we split 4 appetizers and split 3 main entrees and 1 side dish.  Pretty much everything we ate I would recommend. Here is the list:  - Lettuce wraps with chicken and duck filling - Veggie Springrolls - Shrimp wrapped in crunchy Asian noodles - These veggie puffs in crispy crust - 1 order of veggie pad thai - 1 order of pad thai with shrimp and chicken - Lemon Chicken (which was dressed in this delicious funnel cake type crust) - Green beans and mushrooms  To add some zing into the night, we all split a bottle and wine and ordered several drinks to celebrate.  The food bill came to $28 per person, which I thought was amazing cheap compared to other trendy upscale restaurants in the city.  The only thing I would say is that Spice Route has a very specific code when it comes to dress and etiquette in the restaurant.  First of all, my friend was not allowed to wear ANY of her bachelorette props, even though we gave the restaurant a TON of business.  And secondly, when things got a bit more crazy at the table, our group was singing and dancing and the wait staff would give iffy looks, giving us the impression that none of this was acceptable.  Overall, I would recommend Spice Route if you are looking to try something new and you feel like dressing up a bit, but be prepared to be judged if you get a little crazy."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. While the staff tried hard, service was really slow. It seemed like they were incredibly under-staffed. The pace of delivery was really uneven. I get the feeling our food sat around the kitchen for awhile before coming out.  While it wasn't bad, I would probably not go back next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"After what feels like a lifetime, I returned to this venue for an after work networking event.  It is always surprising and slightly risque to sit in the toilet while looking out from a floor to ceiling window. The green garden is very meditative, so it does make for a contemplative toilet time. I could not find the light switch though (but not an issue as it was still light outside).  What stuck out the most to me was how fantastic the bartender was! I ordered a grapefruit juice and it was complimentary! I left her a tip and later returned to order a glass of wine from her. Friendly, personable and treated me with great dignity, regardless of how much I was spending."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. Food here is mediocre at best. What you get isn't quite how it's described on the menu. (Chow mein with calimari had sliced squid instead, noodles were not crispy, red Thai curry was a green curry and was bland, crab cakes were more akin to shrimp balls and were over cooked, sticky rice dessert was like a multigrain or red rice breakfast item) Best tasting item I had was the lettuce wraps and the free fried bread. Only come for drinks and dancing after hours, you can get better quality food for a lower price elsewhere. Unrelated to the food, but I swear they kept the heat off to make you keep your jacket on due to the lack of a coat check service! It was cold in there!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with trendy decor.   The food was overpriced, and alright. The pad thai was TERRIBLE. grant it, it is a fusion restaurant, but they botched the original flavor of the dish!   The crab cakes were too salty, too meaty, and overpriced. Their duck with wrap was OK, but a little too sweet for my taste. I did like their sweet potato fries, however, and our server was excellent.  The womens' bathroom was ridiculous: very glamorous, with a \"bathroom man\"- maybe a bit much?"}
{"text":"I came to spice route with 7 other people and none of us were impressed with anything other then the ambiance.   Spice Route is beautiful & you have to check it out but I would reccomnd coming for nothing more than drinks.  Nothing on the menu tasted good!    And don't even get me started on our waitress... she did not care at all and had absolutely no interest in our table until a cute one of my friends showed..after he came she finally started checking on our table and any time someone ordered she would continue to talk to him rather then the person ordering.   I would also make a note of the fact that they are slow in serving their food to ."}
{"text":"Went here once before and did not like it, but went this past Sunday and sat outside and had a totally different experience. If this was my first time the rating would be higher.  They have a type of all you can eat tapas which we discovered after having a great bottle of sake. Took our time and never felt rushed. Food was good, not great but it was nice to try a bunch of different items.  Our server was fantastic. A true professional who knew when to come around. Had it not been for his suggestions, we would have left after the first drink.   The patio is nice, cushions are getting a little worn, but looking at koi is always nice. Would come back to patio on a quiet sunny day. Would not sign up for the pony show inside on a weekend."}
{"text":"This place is sharing-style so it's a good place to come with groups. However, most of the items we ordered were lacking in flavour, which was disappointing based on their descriptions on the menu and their prices. The vegetable pakoras didn't really taste of anything (how can you make anything Indian that isn't packed with flavour?) and the dipping sauce that came with them didn't add much either. The wasabi-wrapped shrimp was $14 for 4 pieces of shrimp, and I couldn't taste the wasabi at all. Surprisingly, the star of the evening was the plate of garlic bok choy, which actually did taste pleasantly of garlic.     The interior is very large, which is nice--you're not right on top of the table next to you, and they have a number of booths that look like they could seat 10+ people comfortably. The ambiance is nice as well. If you're looking for a place to take a large group for drinks it might be a good option, but don't expect too much of the food."}
{"text":"As soon as I opened the door, I knew I was perhaps a little underdressed for the place. (Actually, my 2 friends and I were fully in bright red, TFC gear because we had just left the game.) I said I was meeting someone when the desk girl said, \"Arrre you suuure your friends are at Spiice Roooute?\" in the snootiest voice ever. All 3 of us were immediately taken back. Once I said the name, someone else showed us the table.  Once we sat, the servers were pretty nice and a little more accepting of our clothing, asking about how the game went. The interior was very nice and comfortable and the space was massive. I liked it for the most part. Food was good, service was good. Maybe I can try again in my normal clothes one day and not get a greeting from Regina George of the Plastics. (10 points if you get the Mean Girls reference)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice on two separate trips to Toronto.  My impressions each time were the same:  What's to like: 1. All of the dishes I've tried were relatively good. 2.  It is a very nice room.  What's not to like: 1.  The service is relatively poor.  They do not check back often and food comes out pretty slow. 2.  For what it is, the food while good is over-priced. 3.  Can't decide if it wants to be a yuppie bar or a fine dining destination.  The bar scene aspect detracts from the fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Spice Route came highly recommended to me, so my family went here for my birthday. Ultimately, I wasn't impressed. The ambiance was nice, staff seemed a little rushed, food was fine - but no wow factor.   The kimchi fried rice was not good. Their sushi was okay. The lemon chicken was the best dish we had, and that was actually pretty good.  Overall, I don't get what the hype is about. The food is good, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Attended a party here with some colleagues from work, found that the food was pretty good, nice atmosphere, and prompt service - but that might be a function of the fact that some high-priced stockbrokers were paying for everything.  We ordered a broad selection of appetizers, and the food was pretty good overall.  It's pretty pricey for what it is though."}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time at Spice Route, this time for a private party. I love the atmosphere and sitting outside especially when the weather was fantastic.   We had some yummy chicken satays, and a breaded chicken dish. We had some shrimp noodles and rice dish that was kinda of boring.   Their brownies and cheesecake were great."}
{"text":"Standard king west place....been here sometimes for a drink before going on other places, or just to relax when other places are rammed packed.  Came for food once, it was ok.  wasn't great, wasn't bad, it was Good.  A little over priced for what you get actually.   Service though is always good, even when coming in for drinks.  From the front door to bartenders, to servers...they are never the problem.  I do visit this place here and there, as its not bad for a drink with friends,  but food wise , meh..."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night. It was dead. Waited for the Server to pay us  some attention even though we were sitting right at the Bar. After much delay and waving on our parts, he materialized. We ordered drinks. The drinks are too expensive for what you get. It was a small glass filled with ice.  I have been to this place a few years ago and it used to bustle. Not any more. It's a shame because they have a lot of space and the ambiance is nice. Nothing changed when the music finally came on.  Unsure if they were having an off night."}
{"text":"We went for a pre show dinner at 6pm on a Friday. We called to say we were running a little late and they said just get here when you can. We arrived before 6:30 and the place was fairly empty.  The decor was nice, several dining tables with chairs, some with sofa seats and larger lounge areas with sofas and low tables. There was a private room with a t.v on a slightly elevated level. There was a large bar and a patio area outside. DJ table was set up for what I presume is  a later crowd. The washrooms are cool.....individual unisex stalls with sliding doors that lock with a light switch type button. Opposite the door is a full length window that looks out on a small covered patio. Nobody out there to look in I ordered the pad Thai vegetarian style with tofu. They left off the egg even though I said to put it in but it tasted fine. Hubby had the Mongolian beef and sticky rice which he enjoyed with a glass of wine. Portions are sharing style so we had plenty of food to take home, which they packaged up quite nicely. Service was polite and very quick. Total cost of meals and one glass of wine was around $60 plus tip. Location is east of spadina  but not too inconvenient to walk over to the Royal Alex theatre. Just allow enough walking time."}
{"text":"the best part of the spice route is the decor. it has a really cool ultra-modern, asian feel to it. make sure the check out the washrooms. they're really unique (you'll see).   i went on a saturday night, and it wasn't incredibly busy on the inside. however, the bouncers kept a gigantic line outside. one of the only reasons i got in early was because i tipped off the bouncers $10. pretty cheap, compared to some other clubs i've been to. but considering how un-packed it was, i was really disappointed that the bouncers kept the line so long. the no cover made me happy.  i only went for drinks. my friends and i had bottle service, and the waitress was pretty good. the bar tenders were fast, and i had no issues with them. the food looked good, but considering the pricey drinks, i probably wouldn't order anything more than appetizers.   the music was good, and not too loud. i was actually able to talk to the people beside me. the dj played house and techno, which fit into the environment nicely."}
{"text":"I came here with my partner for a Winterlicious dinner. I've always wanted to come here for food and drinks so why not when the set menu is $28.   The decor was interesting; Asian inspired with drapery, pillows and warrior statues. I like the layout with the big bar in the middle. The bathrooms were a bit strange; I used the ones with the sliding door. The door doesn't close fully and you switch on a light which indicates to those outside its occupied. There is no actual light in the bathroom and there is floor to ceiling windows which looks out to the patio. You can see outside but I'm pretty certain those on the patio can't see you.   Our waitress was great when we got her attention (the GM had to come by to serve us at first). My partner ordered the rock shrimp and calamari, Mongolian sirloin beef and the molten lava cake. His appetizer was extremely delicious. His main was okay; like another review said, it's kind of dumb to just provide a meat dish by itself and no rice or noodles on the side because of the richness of it. Maybe it's something the restaurant can consider for future menus. I had the pork dumplings, kimchi rice & lemon chicken and red bean ice cream with ginger pavlova. Only complaint I had with my choices were that it came out cold. Other than that, all three were delicious.   I'm really rating this place 3.5 stars. I'd love to come back and try other things on the menu and come for a night of drinks and dancing."}
{"text":"Came here with to celebrate a friends bachelor's party for dinner.  Never came here before and I was looking forward to trying the the good food. Well... what I thought it was good food....... wasn't really good at all.....   This place had alot of mixture of Asian food. There is choices to Japanese, Thai, Chinese and I think Korean? ( not too sure about Korean dishes) So when everyone ordered dishes to share, we had got the sweet and sour pork (or chicken), pad thai noodles and a crispy white chicken with a sweet sauce ( don't remember what that was called)  After trying a bit of everything, this place is big let down. The interior of the restaurant really gives the place a nice vibe. The interior resembles a loungy young professional atmosphere. It's pretty dark inside as well which I personally don't really like because you can't see where your stepping sometimes and the tables are pretty close together and I can see people getting angry with you and if your not watching out for their personal space....  That being said the interior tricks you thinking that this place is really good. Maybe this place is good for having drinks more? But definitely it's not a good place for food.   I find that the sweet and sour pork/chicken and pad thai there is no difference than if I had just gone to eat at Man Chu Wok or Thai Express at the Eaton Centre......  It's the same thing.. and the price for the food will cost you an arm and a leg for the same taste and dissatisfying expectations. I personally wouldn't come back here for the food , I may come here for drinks with friends or for work but will not spend any extra money on their food. For Christ sakes, I would go to the friggin, hot dog stand and get a hot dog instead of paying for overpriced food that taste exactly like food court.   Food sucks, good place for drinks maybe. Overpriced restaurant not worth my hard earn money."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I came here after dinner with some friends for drinks. The place is so busy so we sat at the bar. The ambiance is lovely. It's very posh and chic. Even the washrooms are nice with private windows to the garden. The drinks were moderately priced and some were better than the other. The lychee drink and sangria were both delicious. The cosmo was way too strong and had to be watered down (literally). Not a fan at all of their cosmo. Their wedding cake shots are delicious. I didn't check out their food menu since we went there straight from dinner but I heard mixed reviews. Overall, I'd come here for the ambiance alone."}
{"text":"I have walked by Spice Route several times and it looks really nice from the outside so I really wanted to give it a try for dinner one day.   I found a deal on Buytopia which gave 50$ worth of food for 25$ which was really awesome so I decided to get it. I went on Thursday evening which is 1$ sushi night and it was absolutely delicious!   Best first impression ever, we went really early around 5pm because we just wanted to try the sushi quickly before the crowd arrived. The ambiance was really nice, we sat inside but the patio was really nice as well! I loved the larger tables which were nice booths for larger groups, and the decor was very nice! I like going to restaurants, lounges and other venues for the ambiance and the decor so I loved it.  As for the food, the Green Dragon roll and the Red Hot roll were amazing! The presentation was really nice, even the plates that the food was served on was very nice and I really enjoyed eating the rolls. I tend to love sushi and maki rolls and I've tried many places with my friends and Spice Route makes really good ones!  Since we had the Buytopia deal, we decided to try something from the regular menu as well since we loved the sushi from the 1$ sushi menu. This was a mistake. We asked the waiter if the Pad Thai was good and he said it had a really authentic Pad Thai taste which some people don't like since people around here are used to the more sweet tasting Pad Thai. We decided to give it a try anyway because I've been to Thailand and I love Pad Thai, and I've been to many Thai restaurants because it's one of my favourite cuisines. This Pad Thai was really awful! I usually like anything and I'll eat anything but I was really disappointed by the Pad Thai which was 18$. I wish we had gotten a few more orders of the Red Hot and the Green Dragon rolls to complete the 50$ of the deal instead.  Aside from the Pad Thai, everything was great, I will definitely come back here and bring my friends here for 1$ Sushi Thursdays. I will also definitely come back during the evening hours for the bar/lounge atmosphere which is what Spice Route is really famous for, and I'm sure that will be amazing! I definitely recommend that anyone goes there, I would just avoid the Pad Thai, and stick to the Thuraday sushi menu if you are planning on dining there."}
{"text":"The only reason I stepped foot in this place was to hang out with friends I hadn't seen in half a year who insisted on coming here for Summerlicious ($25 prix fixe). Having read Yelpers' comments, the bar was already low, but Spice Route was like a fat guy doing limbo - bending over backwards to make it under, but his belly just ends up knocking the bar down. He's fun to look at, but then you realize his limbo attempt is just a stupid joke that isn't really worth a laugh after all. Nah mean? This place seems to be all about appearance rather than food or drink. Wasn't impressed by any of the three courses of my meal.  Made a trip to the ladies' room (AKA had to find a door with a \"W\" on it... Ooooh, how postmodern minimalist), and overheard a dude say \"That was the worst bathroom experience of my life.\""}
{"text":"A very beautiful restaurant and a pretty big menu of asian fare doesn't make up for the bland tastes and high pricing.  There are some standouts on the menu (fried spicy calamari, duck and chicken lettuce wraps, some of the dumplings) but most of what is on the menu is pretty weak and bad portion sizes.    And the clientele is pretty terrible.  I guess King West just isn't my thing but if you go here any later than 8 o clock from thursday to saturday I wouldn't bother eating here.  More of the same tacky lounge crowd that domintes king west these days.  If you want asian food then maybe actually venture out to one (too bad all the good ones are in markham)."}
{"text":"Swanky, dramatic, club-like design but the food is only marginally better than Spring Rolls (aka fake and overpriced \"pan-Asian\"). I went here for dinner on a date and felt like he was trying too hard to impress me with his trendiness. Looking at the other tables, it seemed like others were doing the same."}
{"text":"Chiming in to add a dinner perspective, not a drinks perspective.  Came around for dinner on a Tuesday night at around 6 or so. Place was pretty empty, so no wait and the waiters were attentive. I guess as this place fills up, they get swamped and find it harder to come around every table regularly.  The concept of this restaurant is \"family style food\", so the plates are meant to be shared. The menu is a little misleading though, because the small bites section is called \"to share\" and the rest of the menu is laid out to suggest individual dining. The waitress came by to explain the concept to us, so we picked the crispy duck breast, the rare tuna, and the side of baby bok choy.  I have to say the tuna stood out. You get four pieces, and four lumps of veggies: a lump of veggies under each piece. The tuna is rare but so juicy. The texture is almost not like tuna--more like beef, surprisingly. In any case, very different.  The baby bok choy was pretty similar to any pan asian bok choy: a starchy thick sauce and lots of garlic. The duck breast, despite its name, was not deep fried and not very crispy. I was actually happy about this unexpectedness because I am not really a fan of fried foods.  I do have to insert a little rant about the bathrooms here though. They are so confusing! It should not take this much effort to go to the washroom. First of all, all the bathrooms are individual rooms with one toilet in them...except for the room in the middle of the hallway, which was a normal men's washroom. I didn't know it was a men's washroom at first, so I walked in only to see urinals. Thank god there were no people using the washroom at the time. It wasn't until later that I noticed the small Ms and Ws on the doors. All the individual bathrooms have a huge ceiling-to-floor one-way mirror, but I wasn't aware that they were mirrors and I thought they were just seven-foot windows so anyone outside could watch you answering nature's calls. Definitely put me on edge... what if someone has performance anxiety?! Last of all, the locking system for these bathrooms is so unintuitive. The doors are sliding doors, and there's a switch (similar to a light switch) that you flip to lock the door. The switch turns on an electromagnet so the door won't open, but that means nothing moves and there are no noises to tell you the door has locked. You need to try opening it yourself to check whether or not it's locked. I had to try three bathrooms before I found one whose lock was working.  Like I said, going to the bathroom shouldn't be so confusing. If I really needed to go, I would have peed my pants before figuring out all the bathroom logistics."}
{"text":"Bring your parka! We went for NYE and it was absolutely freezing in the restaurant, almost every person there wore their coats for their entire meal.   Apparently, the venue isn't insulated. It's way too cold to eat dinner here, I'm sure if you're going for drinks and to dance it would be fine?  Shared dishes were all tasty but came out hot but as soon as you scooped it onto your plate it was luke warm and in no time, cold.   Extremely disappointing, because the staff is awesome and so is the space. I feel bad doing this review because the manager did comp our bill (for the food) but it seemed as though he had this same conversation daily.  Its really time  to invest in some space heaters. . . . I ate here last May and it was overall great."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great potential but sadly the food is average.  We went there with my boyfriend last summer, we ordered the surf + turf and the vegetarian pad Thai.  The surf + turf had no taste and the bun for the mini burgers tasted like bread that sat outside for too long.  The pad Thai wasn't exceptional either and barely had taste. The terrace is really nice, same for the inside of the restaurant and the staff is friendly. But I won't be back because in my opinion, the food was not worth the price I paid for."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I like Spice Route.  I agree that it's a bit pretentious, the food is way overpriced for the quantity that you get, but everything I've had there has been quite delicious.  The ambience is great - posh, sexy, trendy - there's no other place like this in Toronto that I know of (closest place might be Ki). I've always had good service. They may not be the promptest - but our waitress never forgot about us and always came back to check on us. I've also never felt rushed there and my last visit there was well over 2 hours! They also automatically bring you complimentary sweet breads with salsa, which is a nice departure from the normal bread and butter most restaurants bring.  Foods I enjoy there: Beef over hot rock, beef carpaccio, and cheesecake lollipop. I also really like the Zengria drink, which is a variation on sangria.   So... great food, great decor and good service - this deserves 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad but was decent. Ambiance was lively I really enjoyed it including the service. All in all when everything has good feels to it then the restaurant deserves a good review. It is a fusion restaurant so must say the food wasn't bad but it also didn't scream I love it felt the Peking duck could of been sliced a bit thinner. Presentation I enjoyed. But the music the people and interior really has it's unique to it. Must check it out. Girls night here is worth the time."}
{"text":"Been here for dinner with my girlfriends and the atmosphere is great. Feels like a Vegas wannabe vibe. The food however is nothing special. I can go to Chinatown and get better quality food. You're paying for the experience mostly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor is nice.  This place is very aesthetically pleasing and has that intimate atmosphere.  A few people told me it was really good so my girlfriends and I decided to hit this place up for Winterlicious.  Clearly the phrase \"really good\" didn't apply to Winterlicious.  I thought that the dishes were mediocre...nothing compared to the greasy, non-fancy Chinese places (see my review for Congee Queen).  I had the Mongolian beef which was a little too spicy and it came on a bed of baby bok choy...they couldn't even give you noodles or rice!  It didn't have much flavor, either.  A few of my girlfriends had the salmon which was cooked really well - nice and tender, not dry.  The yakisoba noodles however, were ridiculously overcooked!  Overcooked to the point where the noodles just kind of crumble in your mouth when you take a bite.  The fact that we had to wait 15 minutes for our dessert is mind boggling.  Our waitress was kind of snobby and said \"I put the order in 20 minutes ago it's not my fault blah blah blah\".  I'm willing to try this place again ONLY because I looked over at the table next to us and their food looked really good.  They didn't order from the Winterlicious menu.  The guy had orange chicken and it looked pretty legit.  Too legit to quit."}
{"text":"Stopped in briefly during clubbing hours. Liked the vibe. Very chill and attractive decor."}
{"text":"The place has super cool ambiance.  That is the main reason people go there. Their washrooms are very interesting, as other people have mentioned they are pretty dark, but they do have a glass wall (looking to a closed garden).  The prices are pretty steep making it very very classy.  Food: Food comes in small portions, but with lots of artistic thought but behind it.  Cost: 2 beers, 2 wines, 2 appetizers and a desert: 70$.   I would recommend this place if you want to grab a drink after work.  (Fancy cocktails rather than beer)."}
{"text":"The duck wraps are beautiful, and the Sashimi Tuna Salad unbelievable. If you order the boring dishes, you will get bland flavours, but the more daring you are at this restaurant the more rewarded you will be (as for most restaurants).  Very much on the pricey side though :("}
{"text":"This is the worst food that I have eaten in Toronto.  We ordered a number of dishes with my friends.  The spicy curry shrimp didn't taste like curry.  The curry was watered down.   the spicy chicken was basically 4 drumsticks and they charged us $21 for it.  seriously?  The sticky rice was dry and tasteless.  The beef dish was disgusting.  same goes for the rice dish.  Also ordered the lamb.  disgusting.  $28 for 4 lamb racks.  terrible.  The disgusting food was overpriced.  Kung Pao Chicken was $20... seriously?  I can get better kung pao chicken at a chinese restaurant for $6 and it will taste soooo much better.  On top of that, they charged us a mandatory 16% tips but the tips was calculated after tax so tips ended up being 18%.  This is wrong!  tips is always calculated before tax.  There's nothing great about this \"restaurant\".  Most of the dishes are chinese food but you'll find better chinese food at a real chinese restaurant.   And finally, spice route has been cited numerous times by Toronto health for sanitation, employee hygiene, failure to protect food from contamination, failure to wash equipment and the list goes on.   Summary: disgusting food that belongs in the trash bin and they cheat you on tips.  Don't go to this restaurant and go to a real restaurant.  This \"restaurant\" doesn't even deserve 1 star.    Not really sure what type of trash food this restaurant is trying to be.  they serve cantonese food, japanese food, dim sum, indian, canadian food...     DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE spice route!  We had our wedding reception there last year and have gone a couple times a month ever since!  Great service great ambiance great food ESPECIALLY the sushi! We were actually going once a week for quite a while for their dollar sushi menu but about 6 weeks ago were informed that they no longer had sushi at all anymore! We looked over and the sushi bar was not active unfortunately! Very sad about that it was such great sushi for a super reasonable price! Please bring it back!  What a great incentive! Glad the wine special still exists!"}
{"text":"This place is massive, and stunning. It's so swank! Come here for drinks, the ambiance, and the decor.  I would never come here for the food, based on intuition and experience with other swanky places such as Spice Route. Neat experience, love the scene."}
{"text":"I've been to Spice Route twice, once with a group of four girls and once with another gal pal. Personally, I love the atmosphere and decor. It's one of my fave spots in Toronto based on the setting. In terms of food, absolutely love the lemon chicken. And also love the lychee martini. My two faves. The downside, the onion rings are not worth getting.   The service is okay. The first time I went earlier (around 6 P.M.) and had reservations which went smoothly. The second time we walked in. The bouncers were pleasant, but the two women at the front completely ignored my friend and I. It was only when a third woman appeared that we received some acknowledgement and were offered a seat in the lounge (which was okay with us since we did not make reservations). The waitress was great. The only downside was we were seated at a table which was reserved for 10 P.M. However, we were not pre-warned that we would have to give up our table when we were seated. Instead, at 10 P.M., a hostess asked if it was okay to move. Instead, we chose to leave as we were done eating and go elsewhere.  Overall, I think Spice Route is worth checking out; I just suggest making reservations and don't expect the greatest service."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I can say the the decor is nice but beyond that there is nothing that special here. The food was mediocre at best, the wait staff was terrible and we had to follow the rules they layout to make out lives that much more difficult. Maybe I am getting old but in my day we ordered food and we got it the way we wanted it...Not here!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the apps, New York striploin Korean BBQ style, eggplant, lettuce wraps, seafood tempura, and vegetable pakoras all very good, ambiance was perfect on a long weekend, busy - enjoyed the whole experience, we were there in a large group, loved it"}
{"text":"If you are going out downtown for a clubbing nite, you will want to be on King Street West. A good and interesting restaurant that is very popular is Spice Route. The food is a sharing concept as well, and it's fusion Asian. The food is pretty good. The reason why it is so popular is because it turns into a music lounge in the evening. You sit in square booths, and then go over to the dance area for socializing, if you want. It's pretty unique and fun place.   Personally, I don't like it too much because I feel like I'm eating in a club and it's really loud. But at the same time, it's really fun when you go in groups and it would be something nice with your friends. It's not very cheap, last time I was there me and my friends paid about $70 each, but that's because they hit you with their drinks. But it's a great place to go before a night out in Toronto's club area. You start there, have dinner. Then have a few drinks. Then after, go to one of the clubs in the king west district. It's very convenient.   Make a reservation. The place is packed.  Service is ok. I witnessed them treat people in different ways like typical bouncers at clubs do.    I think it would be best enjoyed by a group of girlfriends, or the typical clubbing type or just people who want to be seen out on the weekend. It's one of those \"attract 20-25 year olds on someones birthday and then ensure you're getting into cheval or century or something\""}
{"text":"This place is awful. Don't waste your time or money. Food had no taste, was served cold and the service was worse than the food. The best part of my meal was the soy sauce if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"This place gets points for the amazing environment especially at night. I went here on a Saturday night with friends to chill. The music is good and there is plenty of comfortable seating area for large groups. The patio is also very nice. I didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food but service at the bar was very very slow...it took me about 20 minutes to order a drink and the restaurant was not very busy (relatively).   Tip: great place to go if you are looking for a lounge."}
{"text":"Review is for Winterlicious only.  Came here for the $25 Winterlicious dinner: Picked this place mainly because the ambience and outdoor decor seemed quite cool when my friends and I had walked by the other day. And the interior did not disappoint, great place for drinks and seems like a good place in the summer on their patio.  Food was quite disappointing though.. Idk if it's just cause it's Winterlicious or what.   APPETIZER - i got the spicy salmon maki. There were 4 pieces.. Just your regular roll, nothing outstanding. Thought there'd be more to the dish though.  MAIN - tbh, nothing reallly appealed to me from the selection. Maybe it's cause i'm Chinese and the mains were just regular Chinese food. I ended up getting the Miso cod noodles. I expected more to the dish as well.. It honestly just tasted like something I could cook up easily at home.. Like tilapia and udon stirfry.. Not really restaurant quality.  DESSERT -i got the pot de creme which essentially is 3 mini desserts: chocolate mousse, creme brulee with a lemongrass flavour, and a star anise tinted flan. I thought this was unique and I quite enjoyed it.   Overall, I wasn't that impressed with the food, and didn't see any other dishes at other tables that would interest me in coming back.  They also dont split bills... Boo. MAYBE I'd come back for drinks due to the nice environment.. But MAYBE."}
{"text":"I gathered several friends and decided to head to Spice Route for a birthday soiree. I was disappointed with the food and the service. While the servers were cordial and friendly, it took about 30 minutes to place an order for some green tea and another 20 to place our entree orders.  I ordered a stir fry dish. It was dry, bland and wasn't worth the plate it sat on.  It was a Tuesday night - the place was not packed. Highly disappointed and overpriced. Don't be fooled by the slick decor and highly rated bathroom features. You go to a restaurant to enjoy a good meal for the price you pay. If you're looking for subpar service and food, this is your place. If not - go elsewhere. And definitely do NOT celebrate your birthday here."}
{"text":"I lived in Toronto for three months and I enjoyed this place for a couple reasons. 1) It's always free to enter 2) Inside and outside are pretty big 3) The food is yummy 4) Its a great place to grab a drink. Its normally filled with your financial district suits, but they're harmless.   Great place to start of your Friday or Saturday night!!"}
{"text":"Ugh How I wish I could give zero stars on Yelp. Where do I begin? Let me start with a fundamental question. How does a place like this exist in this city? Came here on Saturday night. It was packed. I swear they only had 5 bar tenders in a twenty thousand square feet space full of people. Washrooms were disgusting, dark and the one I used had a broken lock. A gentleman allowed himself in while I was doing my business, even though there was a washroom lady supposedly watching the broken doors so people don't walk into you.   All the bartenders I interacted with were unprofessional, unhappy and clearly hated their lives for working there. They definitely projected these feelings on their customers.   The music was like a resort's night club: 2009 Top 40. There was also a random lady walking around telling people where to stand!!! This place is a joke. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I now understand why this place was dead at 7pm the night I visited.   First, as others have noted the decor is gorgeous. It looks like someone really dumped a ton of money into the interior design. The patio looked amazing - lots of great spots to sit and enjoy drinks.  Our apps were above average - Kobe Carpaccio and some sort of tempura fried tuna roll business. Both were beautifully presented and very good.  Service flat out sucked - our server was a complete space case and disappeared for long periods despite no one else being in the dining room. Runners refilled waters for us, but there was no chance of drinks being replenished.   Entrees were a mixed bag - one of the people I was with had lemon chicken and no, it is not authentic but dear God it was like delicious lemon chicken candy. That sounds gross, but believe me it was delightful. My \"Indian spiced chicken\" was 4 chicken \"lollipops\" aka drumsticks. The spices were nice but the chicken wasn't cooked all the way so I had to eat around the gross bits because our waiter never checked back with us.   Overall, Spice Route is the place to go when you care more about presentation than substance."}
{"text":"It's a great place to bring family and friends if you want to WOW them. The entrance adds to the city chic vibe in the evening. A little loud, decent food. I've been here many times"}
{"text":"Do not open a tab!!!!!!!! We opened a tab, the retarded bar staff are hired to pour cheap drinks not be able to read, thus couldn't find our card. We were told to move out of the way so they could tend to other customers -- whose I assume, cards they were about to hold hostage as well-- waited 1.5 hours for the manager to resolve the issue-- by find the card, reading the name on the card and handing it over to us. If you're that stupid, you probably shouldn't be playing w people's money. Could we chalk it up to pretty girls that attract a crowd w not much wit? No, cause they're quite busted. This nonsense would never fly in a real city like NY-- from where this pathetic place tried to steal Spice Market's concept. Zero stars."}
{"text":"Where to begin....  Bad service. Tasteless food. Bad attitude.  This place is the very worst of King Street where location and a cool decor are expected to be sufficient.  The food was oily and bland.  The waitress was swearing about customers at another table (always charming)  All in all a disastrous experience.  There are so many great places in Toronto to enjoy wonderful food and a great atmosphere. And hopefully when Spice Route folds one of those gems will move in."}
{"text":"Food is average and overpriced for what it is. It's fusion of a lot traditionally Asian dishes. If I want some good har gow (shrimp dumplings), I'd rather get the real thing at an authentic dim sum place for less than $5. This places adds some garnish and it comes to $12. As someone who appreciates real, good, Chinese food, no thanks. That being said, you probably aren't going to Spice Route solely for the food anyway. Patio and drinks are decent. Good place to lounge and nothing more. Still, wouldn't be my first place to chill."}
{"text":"The two star description (Meh, I've experienced better) pretty much sums up how I feel about Spice Route.   I've always wanted to go here, and was happy for my first experience with a group of girls for a bachelorette (warning - they do not allow bacherlorette style attire i.e. beads, boas, crowns). In the end, the experience was just ok. The menu is not as expensive as I was expecting, and I definitely enjoyed the spiked tea pitchers, and ambiance, but those are pretty much the only pluses. Our service was basically horrendous and the food came out sooooo fast that I couldn't help but question the freshness (is there just a buffet in the kitchen where they serve you???). It was kind of disappointing because it really is such a \"cool\" place that if they worked on their service it could be a lot of fun.   Though I'm happy I tried it, I can't say I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"For food a 2. Drinks and atmosphere would be a 4 but the beer (which was bottles only, no draft) was not cold and mixed drinks where overpriced. The calamari app was the only thing we were mildly impressed with out of all the share plates we had in party if 5. Love the concept of the family style share plates, great ambiance and service. Food is lackluster and some hot shot wanna be left a super hot Chile pepper on the plate for decor and that was not meant for consumption...and with lights low mistakes happen....and man did that hurt. If you're going to dress a plate go ahead but don't do it with anything that might completely destroy your entire experience in 1 second.  You could get better Asian anywhere this food is pedestrian at best. Buy a decent grade fridge guys don't cheap out there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music. But the service and food is weak. The food quality was much better 3-4 years ago.  We had the crab cakes & dynamite roll for starters and Mongolian beef & rare tuna for mains. Service was weak and food was boring. It felt like low quality Kelsey's food."}
{"text":"Food - 3/5 Drinks - 4/5 Service - 2/5 Décor - stunning 4.5/5 Atmosphere - 3/5 (deducting points for annoying elevator music from 8-11pm)  I went for a birthday this past Saturday, with a large group of approx. 20 people.  We were booked in a very beautiful private room.  Beautiful - but in no way functional or practical.  The bench seating around the over sized table left ZERO room for people to get out of their seats without having to climb over the lap of the people next to them.  The seating accommodates those over 6' very comfortably however for those average height people like myself I found my back strained all night with no back rest in site, and also having to hunch over the table to eat because of the awkward height of the table.  Our server was good, but not very clear when explaining the family style ordering, as if in a typical Chinese restaurant, leaving most people confused with what to order and how to order.  Luckily I had been to similar restaurants and had an idea of the concept and was able to explain it to those sitting around me.  If the beyond annoying \"modern\" elevator music wasn't blaring in my ears all night I would have explained the same to the remainder of our party since our server failed to do so.  Food was good, not great, just good.  My favourite dish was the Crispy Beef. The Pad Thai sauce tasted \"off\" there's no other real way to describe it.  Nice big Shrimp in the dish, but very little chicken.  The Lettuce Wraps had ZERO flavor and were a complete waste of money.  I heard good things about the Peking duck from the other side of the table, however I did not try it myself.  The Black Bean Chicken was also very good, however, being priced at $21 I expected to see more chicken on the plate instead of the dish being filled with 70% Peppers.  We were also told that the steamed rice was in a very small portion (the server illustrated it by cupping both hands together to form a small bowl amount) so we ordered a steamed as well as a fried rice unaware that the steamed rice was actually a significant portion for 4 people to split.  I ordered the Lychee Martini which was great, we kept them coming throughout the night.  Others ordered the typicaly rum & coke, vodka and 7up, etc.  two friends ordered a double vodka on the rocks with red bull (which they do not carry for some odd reason) so they were offered Rockstar instead.  the vodka was generously free poured however by the time our server reached our table with them a majority of the ice had melted.  Pricing was fair, however they do absolutely NO splitting of bills despite the fact that the 5 people at my corner of the table ordered family style and had requested we have our own separate bill to make things easier.  Sorting out a bill between 20 guests in a loud nook with an oversized table and having to SHOUT OUT what you ordered in order for the waiter to manually calculate on his iPhone is completely archaic!   Not only was I completely frustrated with the Non-splitting of bills, he screwed up!  having to charge an additional $5-6 per person leaving our party sitting there twiddling our thumbs for an extra half hour without even an offer for a refill of water while we waited.  Overall experience 2.5/5"}
{"text":"This review is for the late hour lounge experience.  I didn't eat here so I can't talk about the food. I mean I could, I can tell you what I read off the menu and tell you how I think it would taste. Or I could just lie but just like George Washington said on his webcast, \"I cannot tell a lie.\" It was amazing, I wish I heard the rest but my wifi cut out. (I wonder if Canadians even know folklore of George Washington to get the reference? Oh well.)  This was actually a really nice place to come and have some drinks on the late. The setup is beautiful. Tall industrial ceilings, sleek decor, modern look. Fireplace outside in case it's a bit chilly.   The cocktails were good and we made friends with the bartender who definitely hooked it up through the night. Maybe a little bit too much.    Many shots, drinks and conversation later, we headed out but not before Spice Route left an impression on us. Great spot which I highly recommend on the late."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for anything but yelp is my go to for deciding whether to go to places or not. I felt compelled to write a review for spice route because it was just so bad.  The resto itself is obviously gorgeous, low light, candles, big comfy booths (we were lucky to get one) a main bar in the middle and interesting bathrooms.  BUT THE FOOD WAS SO BAD. I had salmon sushi to start with. the rolls were tiny with alot of rice and a itty bitty piece of salmon but i wasnt to thrown by it i was so hungry.  My mood got worse after me and my friends ordered. My friend got the crab cakes which were not cheap and there were just 3 small ones. I ordered the \"surf and turf\" sliders thinking how can u mess this up.   first of all the slider buns were stale. no exaggeration. the beef patties were alright although i slathered spicy mayo on them to get more flavour. then the tuna patties were horrendously fishy so much so that i asked a friend to try it and she agreed it almost tasted spoiled. the dish was 20 bucks. i only ate half and remained hungry for the evening. ridiculous.   on the upside i tried my friends orange beef and that was good compared to the crap half of us got...so its truly hit or miss here  their cocktails are also tasty (a bit pricey but its downtown) i had the lychee martini and it was yummy  all in all i would come here for a drink with a date if we wanted to dress up and go somewhere calm before hitting up a livelier bar. but other than that i wont be returning."}
{"text":"WOW, what horrendous service.  Unbelievable how a night-spot that puts so much effort into appearance and atmosphere can drop the ball so hard by delivering the complete opposite on service.  Sure busy nights happen and this was a Friday night but it's management's responsibility to staff accordingly. Our cocktail waitress was definitely copping way too much attitude and was not doing Spice Route any favors in the reputation department.  I was in town visiting family and we were looking forward to going out and having a nice night on the town. Too bad Spice Route poured loads of attitude and bad service on our night out. We were all pretty shocked at the lack of interest, slow service and the disillusioned cocktail waitress that was taking 'care' of us. If you end up there and a blonde-Lara Croft-looking cocktail waitress comes your way (it may take a while) make a run for the exit and enjoy your evening elsewhere."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the exquisite interior decor! Was excited to tryout the food, but was extremely disappointed! First off, service was terrible! The server forgot about our appetizer and we had to ask him about it three times, and it eventually came out after we finished our main course. And I had to ask for my drink twice, and I asked for hot sauce, and he never brought me some. When we asked about items on the menu, he wasn't sure about them either...  Had the pad Thai and it was so salty and noodles weren't cooked. Also, tried the fried rice and that was even saltier... Had the crispy duck and my friends seemed to like it. The green beans that came with it were drenched in soy sauce. Whatever you do, do not get the dim sum appetizer! The dumplings/shumai were not cooked at all... Can I just say me steaming frozen dumplings would've tasted better.. We complained about them too and they didn't offer to cook them some more or anything... Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"What a complete and utter disappointment with this place.  We had a party of 15 people, most of who were from out of town.  The evening started off fine but rapidly disintegrated once the food started coming out.  Part of group ordered off the Summerlicious menu, and others from the regular dinner menu.  Everyone ordered starters and main courses.   After a long wait, food began arriving at our table.  What a complete mess.  Entrees arrived before the starters; people were confused as to which entrée or starter was theirs and some dishes didn't come out at all.  The staff and service at Spice Route are abysmal. Possibly the worst service I have ever experienced.  We even had a manager come to our table and literally pointed his finger at a couple of us and yelled \"do you have a problem?'  To add insult to injury, the food wasn't even worth the wait, hassle or price.  The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is the restrooms, which is why I give this place one star."}
{"text":"3.5 I rem going here a lot when it first opened, it was more like a club then, super packed Now it is still packed, but no hassle to get in/line ups.  Good atmosphere, washrooms are of course super cool I haven't eaten here yet, but my friends have and they say the calamari is amazing.  Def would come back for drink when on King"}
{"text":"Trendy Indo-Chinese fusion cuisine.  During a visit to Toronto in March of 2009 a friend recommended The Spice Route.  I love to eat, I love fusion cuisine (in my opinion, my city of SF does it best...but...I am definitely open to being persuaded to think otherwise *haha*) and I love contemporary decor.  I found the ambiance to be young and modern.  The food was good and the service was average.  My friend had made reservations for us, we arrived a bit behind schedule, but were seated immediately.  We weren't overly hungry so we ordered two plates for family style eating: Thai crab cakes, kobe carpaccio (YUM) and All of our food was well seasoned and delicious.  We had 2 orders of the white chocolate lollipop dessert and a mango apple dragon roll.  We also tried a cople of their signature cocktails.  All in all, we left pleased and pleasantly full and only $57.00 canadian lighter in the pockets (not including gratuity)"}
{"text":"I really don't like these places, but this place is very pretty on the inside.  I came here late at night when it was in \"club\" mode and the bouncers weren't going to let me in because I was under dressed (no runners!).  Thankfully, my crew helped me out and I got in.  The bouncer didn't have to be so nice to me so thanks, big guy!  They get an extra star because of this courtesy.  It was packed with a lot of people trying really hard to look cool.  I went to the bar to ask for a drink and asked if they had any drink specials and the dude laughed at me.  Apparently in King West, they don't, so don't bother asking.  For whatever reason, my school likes to have events at these types of \"be seen\" venues.  I doubt I would come here again unless there is a school event I really don't want to miss.  I'll remember not to wear my runners."}
{"text":"Went back to Spice Route last night (the last time I was there was July 2009).  I reiterate.  This is not a place to dine at, it's a place to party.  Don't confuse the two.  I hear the bouncers can be annoying at the door sometimes (depending on what time & on what date you show up).  However, last night at 11pm (a Thursday), I just strolled right in.  Nobody asked for ID.  One great thing about this place is that there's no cover.  It's also never super crowded, and brings in a nice attractive crowd.  I do find the bartenders to be slow at handling orders though.  Beers are ~$7 and mix drinks are ~$8.  The place has an indoor area and an outdoor patio where people smoke.  They do place music, but it's not loud and there's no dancing.  It's more of a place for lounging and conversing."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The meat tasted as if it was from a microwave frozen dinner. No flavor to the Mongolian beef and it came to our table cold. I guess they didn't run the microwave for long enough."}
{"text":"The location is great. It's always busy apparently.The patio is very stylish and their decor is quite captivating. Have you seen the bathrooms? Holy! You think everyone can see you through the glass windows, but apparently they can't! I tested it out, but it still makes me feel very uncomfortable to see people pass by in the garden when I'm inside.  Unfortunately, when I tried the Spicy Indian curried tiger prawns claypot, it was not what I expected. The dish was too watery. It looked more like a soup than seafood. I'm not sure about the other menu option, but I'm guessing the chef should investigate more into what's being served to customers. The service is good. Our refills kept coming faster than most places and they deserved the tip we gave them."}
{"text":"This place looks like a really expensive restaurant that is classy and upscale...BUT rest assured, it's not that pricey.   With that said, I really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant. The moment you walk in you can see how classy and elegant the design of this place is. My wife made reservations for two on a Saturday evening. From the door at the main entrance I was amazed. We walked in, the staff took us to our table and sat us down. We ordered our appetizers and dinner at the same time after taking in the view and deciding from the excellent menu options. To our surprise the dinner and the appetizers came out at the same time. It was weird at first but then all we had to do was request that the appetizers come out before the main course. So that wasn't a big deal for us and we didn't mind at all. The food was very delicious.  The restaurant becomes a lounge with good music as the evening progresses. There is a lounge area that has beautiful couches and throw pillows where you can enjoy drinks with friends in a great ambiance.   All in all, a great dining experience with great service. The food doesn't deserve a 5 star (maybe a 4 star) but I rate this a 5 star for the experience and feeling that my wife and I felt as we left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the decor here. Gorgeous ambience. Music was a little loud for conversation. Came here on a Thursday and they had sushi specials. We were a group of 8 and ordered lots of sushi and beers. The quality of the sushi was great and the meal came down to $20/person including drinks tax and tip. Definitely a great meal in a beautiful venue. Would come back on a Thursday.  The service was a little lacking - they were slow to refill our waters."}
{"text":"Doorman gave me crap because I didn't take my hat off before walking in.  It is -14 outside.  He said his boss told him that's what he has to do.  You can tell what type of place this is...or wishes it was."}
{"text":"I DON'T KNOW! I just don't know how to rate this place... I've never had such hot and cold feeling about a place in my life! So here is the breakdown:  9:45pm: THE GREETING 1 star Don't bother looking for an address or name on the door, Spice Route is too cool to identify itself...   We walked in to meet a friend for his birthday but we were a bit early and the birthday boy wasn't there yet. The girl at the front said it was the restaurant's policy to only seat a reservation when half the party had arrived... What a stupid policy! I guess we'll stand!  10:00pm THE BAR 4 stars I went to the bar twice and although it was packed, I never waited once for my drink. Speaking of drink, both my martini and my rum and coke were good and strong!  10:15pm THE DECOR 5 stars This place is BEAUTIFUL!!!! The interior designer should honestly pat themselves on the back because the space is immaculate! It actually reminds me of TAO in Vegas... but I think TAO has a better understanding of the differences between a Club, a lounge and a restaurant.  10:30pm THE CROWD 1 star When did the Real Housewives of Woodbridge and their hairdressers take over King West?! There was a smell of cheap self tanner and desperation in the air, wrapped up in hot stilettos and a leopard print dresses. I didn't think the atmosphere was pretentious as much as I thought of how sorry I felt for these washed up middle aged women who felt like they needed to tart themselves up in their daughter (or granddaughter's) clothing just to have a man approach them. These are not my type of peeps... nough said!  10:45 THE MUSIC 2 stars This is not so much a criticism of the music played so much as a rant about the volume of the music. Perhaps Spice Route forgot that they are a lounge and as such the music should be background noise... not a soundtrack!  11:00 THE WAITER 1 star I ordered a martini and the Rock Calamari/Tempura Shrimp. My appetizer arrived steaming hot but no drink in sight. 10 minutes pass and the waiter comes by to see if \"everything is alright\" I tell him I am still waiting on my martini... he replies \"so am I!\" Not sure what he meant by that but I don't care! If my food arrives before my drink, it's an automatic FAIL in my books.   11:15pm THE FOOD 2 stars The calamari was good at first but got progressively saltier with every bite. The shrimp on the other hand needed some flavour and the batter was a wee bit too thick in some spots.  If my calculations are correct, that warrants a 2.5 stars... sadly I don't think it deserves a 3 star rating so 2 will have to suffice!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city, if you are in Toronto and looking to have a nice dinner at a beautiful decorated little Asian world with some nicely selected lounge music,This is your place!  It always gets very crowded very early into the evening, so it is very recommended to go earlier or call in for reservations, rather than having to wait outside online for quite some time Service is top notch, food is great and prepared by some of the top chefs in the city, it has that Asian fusion and some far east authentic spices to it.  the decor and Ambiance is very luxurious and trendy, with nice masterpieces to look at in every direction  They also have little private rooms, where are you and your group or guest or date can enjoy some private time  My only intake on spice route is that it's very busy, very loud and finding nearby parking is a major challenge"}
{"text":"For the price you pay for \"asian\" food at this place, I expected a lot better.  The presentation of the food is very well done, but that's about all the compliments I can say about this place.  The taste of this \"asian\" food is horrible.  It tastes like something I made on the way to class during university.  I am okay with low quality food, but not when you market it and price it as something fancy.  Overall, I highly do not recommend coming here for food or drinks.  The bartenders are so stingy with the alcohol content on shots, even when you order 7 of them at a time.  Awful awful place."}
{"text":"Dark, sexy, and posh are the three words that come to mind eating here.  For a Friday night the place wasn't that busy early in the evening.  We were seated immediately and the service was prompt right after we were settled.  I found our waiter Adam to be a little inattentive but he met most of the rules of being a good server (i.e. Don't pretend to be my friend).  The food materialized almost immediately after we ordered which was surprising but well received.  The duck and chicken lettuce wraps tasted amazing though I was disappointed that cheap iceberg lettuce was used and not something more wrap friendly like green-leaf.  The fix to this though was the fact that the lettuce was cut into perfect circles.  The crowd was mixed; some were there to be seen, but most were out for a hot date or to have a relaxed dinner with friends.  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"The first time a friend and I went to this place, the food was amazing. I had this shrimp appetizer that was wrapped in a cool coating! It was wasabi like and tasty! The place was busy and a bit noisy but we were determined to come again. The second time we went for lunch. The service was awful. The server argued about the summerlicious menu and the food was tasteless. What a disappointment. I won't be back due to the inconsistency. It is pricy so I would expect more. Please get back to your original operation and hopefully customers may come back."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times, so a bit surprised I have never reviewed the place on Yelp.   The decor is Asian themed Stylish and a great comfortable place to have a meal or warm-up for a big night. I have always found the service to be very good and the food is typically delicious. This place gets going around 8:30 or 9:00pm."}
{"text":"I give the lychee martini a *thumbs up. We also ordered a bunch of apps and it was definitely below standards for the price. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really great. The hot rock cooking was kinda gimmicky and interesting but not really all that worth it and the sushi have too much rice. The ambiance is the real reason why you should come here - spacious, romantic and the servers really make sure you enjoyed your time. The washroom is quite the experience. The washroom stall has a giant open window looking into side alley of their restaurant with sculpture and gardens. Even though it's a secluded area, I feel a little bit self-conscious doing my business with a big uncovered window right beside me.   TLDR: Come here for drinks but the food is a pass. Make sure to check out the washrooms."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for the atmosphere and service, but 3 stars for the food. The interior is nicely designed like an old Asian temple. Its cool bathroom stalls looks into a Zen garden, and the cavernous dining room is nicely lit (dim and dramatic) to make it feel comfy and relaxing. It is one of the nicest dining environments I have been in a while. There is a small plates menu which I really appreciate.  While the presentation is very nice, I have found most of the plates were rather bland and lacking in flavor (not befitting its 'Spice Route' name).  I was there on a Tuesday night and the place was rather empty until around 7pm and things got hopping after 8pm. It's amazing how the space changes with people. Later in the night I noticed the large table of suits at the back of the restaurant being very loud and obnoxious (which travelled through most of the restaurant) -- I was near the front of the front of the restaurant and was lucky I was seated near them.  The extremely large banquettes along the side of the restaurant could comfortably accomodate a large group of people each.  Overall I had a great time here and will give another try food-wise."}
{"text":"Place is interesting. The food is tasty but pricey, and the portions are very very small. The decor is very very good. But I felt the place is better as a lounge than a restaurant. The seating we got looked gorgeous, but inconvenient for eating a meal. Especially for a party of 12.   Tip: you must check out the bathrooms. The were like the best feature of the joint, snazzy as hell."}
{"text":"OMG, awful place ! And the reviews on http://www.restotoronto.ca tells it all !"}
{"text":"I first went here for the 2013 IdeaCity with Moses Znaimer. It was an excellent experience and the appetizers were delicious! Yesterday I went for my BFF's birthday and opted for the All You Can Eat $24 Sunday menu.   DO NOT order an entree unless you have 5-10 people to eat it but I strongly advise NOT to get the kung-pao chicken. Celery root and overload of sauce made it indigestible not to mention it smells like laundry. We couldn't finish it and the restaurant charged us $30 for the 3/4 that was left, raising all our individual bills. For the amount I ate, my bill came up to $50 for something less filling than a pizza slice or burger anywhere else.  The potstickers order were two tiny little things that looked sad in its presentation and didn't wow me. The chicken pad thai gets spicier with each bite and seemed to be the only menu item my friends and I could eat besides the fried rice. Crabcakes were too salty and the sauce that came with it too creamy and overpowering. Tempura shrimp is a small order you can eat by yourself but still tasty.  Lychee martini and Red Dragon drinks are awesome but at $10 for a 2oz seemed...a little too pricey for my liking.  I wasn't expecting tospend so much on a small meal with absolutely beautiful decor (as has been noted many times) I wanted to order more but everyone stopped eating and we paid our bill already so it was by far the most expensive meal I had all year for low quantity and quality.   I'd return with a hungrier stomach and others but probably go to the LCBO/bar next door for drinks after. Spice Route has nothing on tap, all cans and bottles are overpriced.  MEH."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave before I even arrived. This is the type of place where the bouncer sizes you up before you get in line and determines whether or not you shall have the most esteemed honour of setting foot inside.  Like Ultra, Wet Bar, Century Room, Fluid, Brant House and any other bar that has dress code &/or $20 cover and $15 drinks, Spice Route is not for anyone who goes to bars on a regular basis. It's for the weekenders and the types of people who go to bars on NYE and see nothing wrong with dropping $200 for the privilege.  I was dragged here for an acquaintance's birthday drinks and spent most of the time trying to millimetre my way towards the bar (I failed). Service was atrociously slow. Other people who were eating dinner in the restaurant/bar were surrounded by people standing and trying to get to the bar. I would have been incredibly annoyed if someone's back was pushing up against my chair the entire time I was trying to eat. Servers could hardly make their way through the room because it was so crowded.  The outside patio was nicely decorated and not entirely unpleasant except for the hordes of leering guidos looking to score."}
{"text":"After standing in line for Oasis patio 30 minutes on a Thursday night, we realized how stupid it was!! Why waste our time drinking when you are in the entertainment district and options are limitless!!!  So we quickly made our way to Spice Route!!! No lineups. No doormen trying to power trip you for money!! And plenty of room inside to sit/stand and mingle.... It had a beautiful crowd and drinks were awesome!!! The barman was pleasant!!   Spice route, you've won me!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant failed to impress anyone in our 13 person party.  First, we called two weeks in advance for a reservation for 13 and when we arrived they had to table set for 10 and told us it was our fault. They then proceeded to tell us the biggest table they had was for 10 and we were SOL unless we wanted to squeeze together (which we ended up doing). The manager was less than accommodating and the only offer he had for us was to split up and some of our party sit at another table. We traveled in from New York for a birthday celebration and felt very unwelcome.  Our service was SLOW beyond all belief and our servers lack of knowledge did not help the cause. 13 people trying to order and ask questions was pretty painful. When it came to paying the bill she handed the machine over to one of our guests and had him perform all the transactions with her not helping at all.   All in all we can all say we wish we spent our money elsewhere and do not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE. Especially if you are visiting from another country/city and are expecting a phenomenal meal with even better service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service has been pretty slow, but the food is great so it is worth the wait, but if you're in a rush don't bother.  The drinks are made nice and strong, so if you've had a rough day at work and want to relax and unwind for a couple of hours, it's a great place for you."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and have yet to have a bad experience so I am quite surprised to see all the negative reviews here. The restaurant itself is truly a gorgeous space! From the time you walk up the tikki torch lined entrance to the massive wooden chamber doors you are led into an immaculate space adorned Asian inspired statues and paintings. The hostess takes us to a large booth in the corner with cushy seating sandwiching a huge black wooden table.  Our waitress for the evening is soo friendly and inviting. She informs everything is meant to be served family style and it's best to order many different items and share. Appetizers will come out first and mains will come out as there done from the kitchen.  She takes our drink orders and lets us peruse the menus which consists mainly of asian fusion entrees and everything looks appetizing  Our Green tea returns in a beautiful cast iron teapot. The waitress tells us to give it 3 more minutes to allow the leaves to steep. The tea has a mild and delicate flavour.  Next the Complimentary Amuse bouche arrives  Sweet Buns served w/ a tomato based curry sauce The sweet buns arrive warm and crispy outside and soft fluffy interior compliments the curry sauce well  Indian Spiced Dip and Naan Beautiful presentation and great for sharing it's served with 3 dips (split pea, sweet potato, and a yogurt based dip) The split pea one was my favorite and I enjoyed the contrast of the warm naans and cold dips  Potstickers - Crispy pan fried wontons enclosing a plump juicy pork meatball were also flavorful  Mandarin Sizzling Fried Rice - bbq roast pork and sweet peas Loved this fried rice! It had bbq pork, roast pork, and ham mixed in!  Crispy Orange Beef - crispy wonton, spicy orange peel + garlic glaze This was addictively good! Nice crisp coating tender beef served with red chilies in the mix and an orange glaze sauce on the side. A wonderful combination of sweet and heat!  Chefs Selection of exotic sorbets - House made fortune cookie  Today's selection was mango and tangerine. I loved the tangerine one and it was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and topped with a sweet and GIANT fortune cookie!  Raspberry chocolate brownie - Caramelized mandarins, tangerine cream The brownie was beautifully presented. It was very fudgey, more of a dense mousse like texture. I enjoyed the taste of raspberry mixed into the deep chocolate flavour and you could even taste the raspberry seeds throughout giving it a little crunch against the creaminess! The tangerine cream was also really good also! I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert!  Overall I have to say another enjoyable experience at Spice Route! Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, delicious and exquisitely presented food. I will continue to return again and again! The patio in the summer time is quite the scene. Otherwise its the perfect place for large groups or spot to lounge out with drinks and good food.  FYI Don't forget to check out the bathrooms! Each individual stall includes a floor to ceiling window revealing a zen garden but don't worry no one will get a peep show at you in your knickers!"}
