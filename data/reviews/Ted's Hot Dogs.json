{"text":"I've been meaning to review this for a while now, but never got around to it.  Bottom line: Ted's is fantastic!  I'm been going for about three and a half yeas now, and Ted's has never once disappointed me.  Amazing chili-cheese dogs, brats, and polish and italian sausages.  The dogs are cooked on an actual grill too, which earns bonus points in my book .  The onion rings are also great - greasy, but in a really good way.  Definitely worth the ride out to Tempe."}
{"text":"Ted's is great! I'm not in the neighborhood much these days but I've had many great meals at Ted's in my lifetime. They never disappoint. I don't mind the line because I know my food is being made fresh in front of me, and besides, the employees know how to keep the line moving quickly and efficiently. Don't forget to get a side of liquid cheese for your fries! While I'm sure it's not even technically cheese, it's still awesome. 

This might be a weird praise, but I also like that I've never seen a dirty table here. I hate when I go into a fast food place (chain or independent) and can't find a table to sit at because the slobs before me couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves. I don't know if Ted's customers are super clean, or if employees are sneaking around cleaning tables off when I'm not looking, but I can always find a place to sit here!"}
{"text":"Teds is a good place to go with friends. They grill all of your food fresh in front of you, and have a cool way of cutting up the dogs as they're cooking. I wasn't a fan of their white hots, however I can't fault them, as I've never had them before. I may just hate veal! Their regular hot dogs and brats are spot on, and tasty. The onion rings are hand made, and are also pretty tasty. If you do stop by, make sure to get a chocolate milk shake. It's one of the best in the valley (trust me, i'm fat!).
The service is not amazing, better than McDonalds, and not as personal as a sit down restaurant. They're definitely trained to get you through the line as quickly as possible.
It's worth stopping by to try, as it's pretty unique in the valley."}
{"text":"These are not like my Chicago dogs I grew up with but are tasty none the less.  When you are in line make sure you know what you want and pay attention cause they keep the line moving.  Fries are good and of course so are the dogs."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. Best hot dogs I've had in my life. Grilling the dog make all the difference in the world. I've been to the famous Pinks in LA and this place is way better."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food. The onion rings are handmade and very tasty. They have a veggie dog which is hard to find around here so that was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best dogs west of the Mississippi!!

All beef chargrilled with their house made hot sauce.

Damn mouth is watering might have to go there and get 2 more."}
{"text":"My heart is mostly hard, particularly in places where the arteries have closed and the ventricles seized around a blockage of unknown fatty matter.   I'm fairly certain that I will die before age 40, of some hard-hearted condition related to my perpetual consumption of fatty foods.   For this reason it is perhaps ironic that the one soft spot in my otherwise much-maligned heart is for hot dogs and burgers cooked over an open flame. 

It's no surprise then that I'll be going back to Ted's.  Like a phillistine, I had a chesseburger but it was tasty.  The onion rings are also good, much more to my taste than traditional O-rings.   

Long lines and no ranch makes for 4, rather than 5 stars.  But the staff was friendly, the food priced right and the ambiance fun and lively.  I definitely recommend Ted's."}
{"text":"Stop charging for refills, Ted's. That worked in 1985, but we all know soda costs you less than a penny.

I like the food a good amount, and it's incredibly petty, but I just hate feeling like Ted's is ripping its customers off when literally every other fast-food/casual restaurant stopped doing this two decades ago."}
{"text":"We just returned from Ted's, a place we visit somewhat frequently for great hot dogs, brats, fries, onion rings and have always enjoyed. The white hot and hot dog were great as usual but the fries and onion rings are another whole story. We usually gobble up the fries and onion rings but tonight they got tossed. The fries were DRY and quite frankly tasted like frozen fries, not the fresh ones that are normally served. The onion rings had the disgusting taste of being fried in oil that was either rancid or should have been used to fuel a vehicle. BIG disappointment. We sincerely hope that these issues are corrected."}
{"text":"What gets you 5 stars?  The best bratwurst and cheese fries I've ever had!!!!  This is consistently too, not just super great once because one time I was starving and this just happened to be what I could find to eat and mediocre every time after that.   have yet to be disappointed by Ted's."}
{"text":"The assortment of hot dogs and sausages here are great.  As long as you don't stray off the dog menu, you are golden.

The onion rings are very bland, steer clear of those.  The Burgers are pretty simple as well.

But the sausages, oh the sausages!  The All Beef Hot Dog and the Italian Sausage are excellent, well worth the wait.

The Polish, corn dog and regular dogs are good, but not quite the bang of the Italian or All Beef.

The chili is decent, not very spicy at all, so maybe get some hot sauce on the side to add if you like your chili with some zing.

Overall, I definitely love this place, and will be a regular.  Once I have tried everything a few times, I will settle into a routine of delicious dogs and sausages."}
{"text":"Very good charcoal grilled dogs. I'm not normally a hot dog kind of person, but Ted's is different! 

I got the chillie and cheese dog and I was very satisfied.

I also like how they make the dogs in front of you. They ask what you want again as soon as the dog is cooked so no messing up your order.

Ted's is definitely my first choice for a good hot dog.
I have yet to try their mac n cheese dog!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get hotdogs in the Phoenix area! This is a transplant of a small Buffalo,NY hotdog chain.  The meat is flown in several times a week from Buffalo.  The dogs are great! The Weber's mustard is also a local Buffalo condiment. Don't forget the Ted's sauce on your dog too. It's basically a combination of ketchup with slightly spicey tomato relish. You can also get a foot long or a \"jumbo\" (really thick) hotdog. The \"Jumbo\" burgers are great too.  They serve Polish and Italian sausage too.  The onion rings are a great side.  You know the food is great here because there's always a line.                Be prepared to order your dogs, burgers etc while standing in line.  Don't  be one of those people that holds the line up by not having a clue what you want. If you've never been there before, read the menu posted above the grill area. You don't have to tell them the toppings you want until you reach the cash register area and your stuff is cooked.  After your order your dogs they will ask you if you want any fries or rings,  then later they will ask what you want to drink.  This type of ordering confuses some people.  It keeps the line moving, so play along and enjoy some great dogs!                                                                                                                                If you want to bring some stuff home to enjoy later, they sell the hotdogs in 5 lb bags(roughly$5 per pound.) They also sell jars of the Ted's sauce and the Weber's mustard)"}
{"text":"The hot dogs are similar to what you would have at a good back yard BBQ. This place is a bit overrated, nothing compared to Pinks or Wurstk√ºche in Los Angeles. The onion rings were the best item to get here."}
{"text":"I've visited a friend in the Phoenix area twice and both times we went to Ted's. The first visit was at his suggestion but the second time around, I pretty much demanded it. The line was pretty long each time, but for good reason...great food. REALLY like the charbroil aspect; I had a hot dog the first visit and a brat the second - both were worth writing home about. I remember the fries being pretty standard - not bad but nothing overly exciting. The staff were upbeat both times and I'm looking forward to my next visit. Excited to see they take debit/credit now!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you tire of various types of food and sometimes nothing but a hot dog will do.  I live in the S.F. Bay Area, was visiting in Tempe and had one of those afternoons when I wanted nothing but a hot dog.
I got the foot long and it tasted good, but next time I'll try the all-beef which my wife had.  The kitchen is well-maintained and the self-service is efficient, even with a line 20 deep.  The grill uses charcoal.  Although I didn't order any fries or onion rings, they looked good and Ted's also touts real ice cream milkshakes.
The only minor downgrade I have is that the location is in a strip mall and it just lacks a traditional hot dog stand feel to it.  It's clean, but maybe just a little too clean.  Otherwise, very good..."}
{"text":"Ted's Hot Dogs is a fun place to have lunch.  It's kind of a nostalgic sort of place with memorabilia on the walls.  You will feel like you've gone back to a simpler time when you eat at Ted's.  My favorite is the All Beef hot dog but they also serve hamburgers, french fries, onion rings, milk shakes, etc...  I would have given Ted's 5 Stars but their bathroom is too small for all of the crowds they get here. Hard to get a seat here if you know what I mean.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed! Just make sure you use the facilities at home before you go."}
{"text":"The hot dog is average. The burger is below-average. Sorry, folks, that's the truth.

I've held off on reviewing this place for awhile now. Overall I don't consider it fair to review a place after only visiting once, but I cannot bring myself to go again, and Ted's will not exactly hurt from me saying bad things about them. Also, seeing as how the food my friends had looked the same (I think I tried some of theirs but can't remember for sure) and they raved about it, I don't write this off as an anomaly and will go ahead and review Ted's.

Like I said, the hot dog was extremely average. Nothing different than you would get off of a typical hot dog vendor.

The burger was below average. The patty was too thin and it just wasn't that good.

The workers were what I like at a place. They took my order, made my food, and nothing more. Good job. The store has a pretty cool feel to it. The line was short when I went, but apparently it can get quite long.

How was the experience overall? Well, I won't go back as I would rather have a hot dog and burger from Sonic or (cue dramatic chipmunk) RALLYS. ...Exactly."}
{"text":"Got to admit, this place is somewhat of a dive. But this is the BEST hot dog place in the west. And im not the only one to think thag way. There currently ranked 8th in the usa. Best hot dogs. Charcoal grilled with whatever toppings you want!!!!"}
{"text":"First off, the chili cheese and onion regular hot dog I got was really good. I usually don't like hot dogs. Fries are nothing special but the onion rings are extremely  yummy and freshly made every day. But besides that the place is a mess, there's a certain woman upfront who doesn't speak good English so it's hard to place an order. The place was a really mess of people and it takes a while to actually get your food, in other words, it's not exactly fast food. So I wouldn't go again unless I craved a hot dog really really bad. The atmosphere is what sucks the most."}
{"text":"Ted's is the best, it really is. Charcoal cooked hot dogs, awesome onion rings, and loganberry. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Last week, March 10, I am go to Ted's Hot Dog with my two roommates. Because I have another friend tell me this place is great, is delicious, you'll not regret it. First this place is very near for Arizona state universe, also is very near for my home, I am live in Broadway road, walk to ted's hot dog maybe 15 minutes, I think that is great, when the finish to the eat, we can walk to home, this is fitness. 
We are arrived to ted's hot dog in 8:44 Pm, eat for dinner. May be the time was a litter late, not have more customers in the shop. But the shop is very clean, you can feel the shop is regular store. 
Ok, we are chosen for eat, they have a lot of options for their dogs and burger, of course, this is hot dog store, I am chosen the foot-long dog, fries and drink, total is 9.37 dollars add the tax. The hot dog just has 4.09 dollars, a big one, I think that is a pretty decent price, and when I finish eat for that, I am full. You can add more lettuce, tomato, onion if you want, but I do not like pickles, so not add pickles. About the fries, I am buy large fries just need 2.49 dollars, it is large, I think the large fries is better for McDonald's. and my friend buy the bacon cheese fries, that is look very delicious, fries and ketchup is perfect march. The hot dog look is very big and juicy. The service is very passionate, employees will be very patiently waiting for your choice, we are just wait 3 minted for we are food and I am talk for my friend not one disturb us.
Overall, lots of options, delicious food and a pretty decent price. Have passionate and very nice service I think you can to try.,"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ted's Hot Dogs my entire life, so my opinion may be a little biased. Nobody around has hot dogs as good as these guys. Lucky thing about Ted's is that they have 7 locations in and around Buffalo, New York and ONE in Arizona. 

What makes them great are the dogs, obviously. They still have the natural skin casings, so when they're cooked over the large charcoal grill the outsides get nice and chard 'n crispy. When you bite into one of these you get a nice satisfying POP. The toppings you can get are pretty standard but also very fresh, and the chili is very meaty and goes on perfect with a little bit of cheese. The other menu items are just as good. From Foot-longs, White Hots, and Bratwurst to Hamburgers, Corn dogs, and Chicken. It all gets thrown on the grill and cooked to perfection.

Like I've said before my opinion is a little biased, Ted's being a childhood favorite of mine. But nobody stays open for more than 25 years, and still has a guaranteed line out the door during lunch time that isn't worth checking out."}
{"text":"Now this is what I call a good hot dog!...Not just good, they are GREAT :) This what a ballpark hot dog is suppose to taste like...and cost. The  value is amazing for everything you get. 

Oh, and I tried the onion rings after reading all the great reviews and they truly are some of the best onion rings I've ever had. 

By the way, I am usual not the type to get up to order seconds, but this time, I couldn't help myself...just had to have another!"}
{"text":"Ted's.  A place that knows great dogs and won't look down at your for ordering them \"your way\".  Make no mistake, their \"standard\" fare is quite excellent, but if you want to mix things up they'll gladly help."}
{"text":"Old fashioned hotdog shack. Meat is grilled right in front of you on a charcoal barbeque. Get it chicago style! This is a local gem and very popular spot - especially for lunch. If you show up at the lunch rush plan on at least a 15 minute wait until you can get your order in. But it's worth it!

Two do not's:
1. DO NOT put ketchup on your hotdog! That is hotdog treason.
2. On a more serious note, if you feel like a hotdog but there is an ASU game about to start, DO NOT show up at Ted's! Very long lines (over half hour just to order) on ASU game days. Just wait until it is closer to game time when everyone has cleared out."}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about it, I stopped once with my family to find that they only took cash but didn't have an ATM in the lobby. So I went back when I was on my way to school to grab something and got a seriously bad stomach ache. 

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I did not have high expectations of this place, especially since everyone raves about Portillos and it was just so-so.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the hot dogs are fantastic! They're grilled in front of you, perfectly charred, and so juicy and delicious.

They also have bratwurst and polish sausage on the menu I will definitely try a bratwurst next time. My husband doesn't like hot dogs ( aka composite meat ) so he had a hamburger instead.  He said it was good and he'd  order it again. The servings of french fries and onion rings were  big enough to share. The onion rings were good and crispy, not too greasy and fries are good too. 

The only downside was the seating. The booths are \"set\" meaning there's no way to adjust the table closer for little kids, and if you're tall, you'll have to fold yourself into the booth which is a little uncomfortable. Other than that this was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Loved the blistered skin of the dogs from the charbroiling that they do right in front of you.  Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was 4 years ago. I used to visit Ted's twice a month. I would always get the White Hot. They were great. Well today was a very deferent story. I ordered two White Hot's and a regular fry. For just over $11. I am sorry to say that the quality of the White Hot's have gone down hill. What happened Ted's the White Hot's used to be amazing."}
{"text":"I found this place after I had been harboring a hot dog craving for a few weeks. I'm a vegetarian, and I was completely disappointed by how many restaurants in the valley do not have vegetarian options. While I do not expect a special menu for my dietary choices, it is nice to be able to go out to a restaurant with friends and not have to worry about what I can order. I found Ted's Hot Dogs after scouring Yelp for hot dog places nearby. After checking the menu of ten different hot dog places, I finally can across Ted's. 

I brought a non-veggie friend to try it out. I ordered the veggie dog, and my friend and I split some fries and some onion rings. I was in heaven. The hot dog was amazing, and they dressed it up exactly like I wanted it. The fries were thin (sort of like shoestring fries), which I actually like because they're great for dunking. The onion rings, however, on my first trip were awful. They were little more than greasy onions with little batter. On my next trip, I skipped the onion rings. I'm very glad that I decided to try again, though, because when I returned to Ted's yesterday, I ordered them and they were absolutely amazing. These rings were properly breaded and they tasted perfect. I believe they're made right in the store, as they're wrapped in wax paper.

Long story short...the prices are amazing, the food is good, and this place is vegetarian-friendly. I'm very happy with this place and will definitely be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Ted's is a Buffalo Hot Dog place, transplanted into the Valley of the Sun.  Lesson #1: Keeping a Hot Dog from curing...as the fat cooks and liquefies, a hot dog can curl up on the ends...to prevent this...cut the #*%@ out of it. 

You can watch the highly sharpened forks go to work on the dogs as sort of a show before getting your food.  This place has thrived on the corner of McClintock and Broadway for many years.  A very limited menu and the dogs great taste make the difference here.

As for the downside, this Chicago guy likes his dog with the sport peppers.  Jalepenos are close, but not the same...and I miss the neon green relish and especially the poppy seed bun.  The dog itself tastes great.  Less satisfying where the onion rings...a greasy mess and the fries are just average.

Still, the place is packed during lunch as hoards from all professions descend on the corner.  It's hard not to be a fan of Ted's."}
{"text":"Ok as a former employee (4 years ago) and as a current customer, this place isn't to shabby.

The food is pretty good, the lines are not to bad.. UN LESS
it is Saturday or Friday night, then you are talkin about waiting in line for about a good 30 min. Over all, the food is good, the service is okay, the wait time... sucks on weekends.

-Former Employee and Current customer :)"}
{"text":"Great place and honest cooking right in front of you."}
{"text":"First timer somewhat impressed fairly long drive though. Will possibly give them another go."}
{"text":"This is my kind of restaurant.  Very simple menu of things you would eat off the grill.  Burgers, hot dogs, brats all cooked over a charcoal grill.  There was a bit of a wait in line, but the price and taste of the food was worth the wait.

Great place...will be back"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the chili cheese dog. The cheese they use is your standard melted plastic looking nacho cheese. Very flavorless chili too. 
Four dogs and a small tea cost me $16...kinda pricey and I expected more."}
{"text":"Hot dogs snap when you bite into them.  I love Ted's homemade relish also.
I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The dogs, burgers, and fries are good and the price can't be beat. There is a reason the line is always so long around lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I can remember. They have absolutely the best hot dogs in the world and their quality has never changed. Yes, it's a bit pricey for hot dogs and fries, but it's so worth it in my opinion! The dogs are cooked till their skin is crispy and charred and their complimented with whatever topping suits your fancy. The service is quick, but still made-to-order and they staff is great. The ONLY thing that bugs me is when there are customers who have never been there and they do not know how to order. It gets on my nerves."}
{"text":"This one of the very best hot dogs you will ever get.The manager \"Blain\"(I hope I spelled it right) was a true grill master! Amanda made our shakes! She has since moved and we really miss her.But, you can still get great shakes. The chili they put on the hot dogs tastes as if it has alot of ketchup in it,so I forgo the chili. That's okay to me because the hot dogs are really good without it.We really love the music, one time it was 70's and the next time it was 50's.It reminds me of the days of the \"Happy Days\" diner. We love it."}
{"text":"The all beef hot dog is one of the best hot dogs I've ever had, whether you add on chilli, cheese or sauerkraut or not. The footlong is also a tasty dog with all the different toppings. The highlights of the toppings are the chilli and salsa. Don't forget to add both fries and onion rings, their bomb!"}
{"text":"My experience with Ted's was not a good one this time around.  It had been years since I had been  there  and I was not all that impressed back then.  It did not even make it on my \"if I'm ever in the neighborhood again\" list.  But recently I had a craving for a hot dog and decided to try Ted's again.  I ordered a hot dog a  brat and a side of potato salad.  The hot dog was average at best.  The brat was RAW on the inside and inedible.  And the potato salad was completely tasteless and most of the potato's were hard from not being cooked long enough.  Even though I did not have a good experience I'm still not ready to check them off my list.  Although I will never drive from Phoenix to Ted's JUST for a hot dog like I did this last time I will at least give them one more shot if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"My favorite hot dog place in the U.S. I use to frequent the locations in Buffalo.  I was elated when I found out there was one in the valley!"}
{"text":"The best - period. Everything is charcoal broiled and the selection is ample, including jumbo beef dogs, bratwurst, \"white hots\", foot longs, etc.  Excellent fries, loganberry shakes. There are often long lines around lunch, but they move quickly. Ted's originated in Buffalo and is a legend there, along with wings (invented at the Anchor Bar) and Schwabl's."}
{"text":"For whatever it's worth, this place looks like a hotdog place should. Tried the Mac and Bacon dog and wasn't impressed. I'll try the place again and most likely get a regular dog and see if any better."}
{"text":"I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. The hot dogs were grilled to order and they had just about all of the condiments needed. I didn't try the Ted's Hot Sauce, which I will the next time I go. 

There was a line, as many reviewers mentioned, but it went by pretty fast, Ted's kept it moving. We also got a table for 4 with no problem. Great place!"}
{"text":"Im so sorry Portillos I didn't mean to stray. Believe me it will not ever happen again!! 

The service was ridiculous. They have no rhythm and the onion ring guy apparently didn't hear my order so we had to wait for those. The onion rings were the only thing good!

I threw my hotdog away. I took one bite and after tasting the dry bun I decided to eat no bun. Couldn't do it. Threw it away. 

My bad never again. Should have just gone to Costco for a $1.50 dog n pepsi. At least I could get a refill."}
{"text":"Come in looking for a classic hot dog experience and you won't be disappointed. They char-grill everything. Half a dozen hot dog options, plus sausages, chicken sandwiches, burgers, fish  sandwiches, fries, onion rings, shakes, etc. Great kids meal deals."}
{"text":"First off the food was ok nothing to write home about. Its a grilled dog that's it. What really got me was customer service I felt as though I was an inconvenience to the person taking my order. And the price wow kinda high for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food, and the Loganberry is awesome, but the fries could be better"}
{"text":"Best onion rings in town (hand battered and fried to perfection) and arguably the best hot dog(grilled on real coals not boiled) in town.  It is also the only place in town I know of to get a Loganberry shake.  This place has never let me down."}
{"text":"Was impressed.... At first....  Burgers are not the same.  All the dogs and brats are good, but not quite great.  Onion rings are great.  So is the setting of all the Buffalo college posters and pix on walls.  All that shines and glitters from the outside, doesn't make the dog taste better....  Great location of major cross streets."}
{"text":"if you are in tempe, and want a quick and delicious lunch, ted's is the place to go.  ted's is a perfect place for a great brat on a toasted bun.  they have the art of cooking hot dogs and brats down to a science.  the line goes fast, too, so its always a good place to meet a friend at lunch."}
{"text":"I have been going to text for over 20 years. This is by far the best hotdog in town. No where else can you get them char broiled instead of boiled. Their shakes and malts are awesome also."}
{"text":"Only been here once, long line to the door BUT worth the wait!  It's fun watching them yell out orders and everything is prepared right in front of you...  amazing hot dogs!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Ted's. Yes, there is generally a long line, but the hot dogs and cheese fries are worth the wait. It is an lovely inexpensive meal. Sometimes it can be a bit busy and loud, but the food makes it worth it. As a side note, if you get a milkshake, let it sit for a while before you sip it...because it's very thick and will be a slight pain to try to drink if you don't."}
{"text":"How I've missed you old friend! I haven't been to Ted's in some time, but took my brother in law from out of town there. Ted's hasn't changed, same great food and long line! 

Can't beat the way they cook a hot dog. I also tried a shake for the first time. The shake wasn't the best I've had, but definitely very good. I'd get another shake there anytime."}
{"text":"I didn't think the place was anything special, but I wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the area.  I had a bratwurst with sauerkraut and a white hot, wife had the regular burger, and the kids had chili dogs and a burger.

I didn't think the white hot was spicy at all and the bratwurst was lacking flavor.  The wife said the burger was just the right size and the kids liked their food.  We didn't think the food was bad, but we wouldn't go out of my way for it.

They charge 25 cents for a refill, but the large sodas we ordered were more than sufficient for the meal and we didn't need a refill at all."}
{"text":"Teds is the place to go for a hot dog. I have yet to try a better hot dog than an all beef hot dog in the classic New York style dog. Teds has also recently been renovated. This is a very high quality establishment."}
{"text":"There has never been a time where I regret standing in the massive line to get my jumbo burger."}
{"text":"Loyal Ted's customer for 30 years. 
Ate a late lunch at Tempe location, 330pm on June 2nd, 2016.
The woman cooking on the grill was obviously new and absolutely miserable from the moment we placed the order. 
The sausage was burnt black so we asked her to recook it.
More misery and comments from her and other workers.
The re cook was raw and undercooked, dangerous when dealing with pork. 
Very sad, we love Teds.
If we were first timers, we would never go back."}
{"text":"Best corndog I have ever had! Perfectly crispy outer layer and a very light and fluffy breading. The burgers and dogs are great as well; I personally like the bacon and Mac dog.  Worth the wait. Love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome experience, I've only been there twice but I just moved across the street. I know I'll be in more often, they seem consistent."}
{"text":"Bacon Mac hot dog is so good. Onion rings are fresh & you get a heaping amount. Waited in line for 15 minutes, but definitely worth the wait for hot dogs off their charcoal grill."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place to go if you're looking for a good hot dog. Service is fast, and the food extremely enjoyable. The seating is clean, though the restaurant itself is a little dim. Great for fast, cheap, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh Ted's............

Ted's is my second favorite Hot Dog joint.  My order has not changed in the 6 years I have been going there.  Two reg dogs, one with chili mustard, and onions the other with hot sauce, mustard, and onions.  an order of onion rings and a chocolate shake round it all out.

It tastes the same every time (delicious) and you can't beat the price or ambiance.  I love when you're sandwiched between a couple in their 70's and a family with small kids, everyone just enjoying Americana.

Ted's does it right, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Being from the East coast, I thought would get a nice hotdog with good chili at Ted's. Boy, was I wrong! Worst chili ever! I'd rather buy the $1.50 hotdog and soda at Costco. This meal was definitely nothing to phone home over!"}
{"text":"Always good, this time had a sea dog, a foot long piece of fried fish in a roll. Really good white fish, probably cod."}
{"text":"Be prepared for long lines!  They do a good job of moving you through quickly though.  I love this place.  Love the way they cook the dogs in front of you, love the lingonberry juice, don't like the seating area but what do you expect for a hot dog joint? :)  Great place to take the kids."}
{"text":"They have a real grill. With FIRE! Take cash, because that's all they accept. I did it up right with a dog basket and vanilla milk shake.

The line seemed long, but they've got such a system that it moved really quick."}
{"text":"finally went. My mother was craving a chili dog while we were out one day so we decided to go for lunch. I wish that I enjoyed it as much as most other people seem to. 

Food wasn't what I thought that it would be. I thought that the hot dogs were okay, nothing special and not worth the price---I've had better from the grocery store and cooked on the grill at home.  My mother didn't like the chili and I didn't care for the sauerkraut that I had on my bratwurst. The onion rings were decent though.

The decor is cute and makes you feel like you've been pulled back in time and out East. Now this is where the big problem starts...

The service is just horrible. I encountered four different people working there and only one smiled, another asked me what I wanted and then snapped at me for \"ordering incorrectly\" (like I know how you're \"supposed\" to order at a place that I've never been to?)  and the last girl was breaking all kinds of health code violations. Seeing her play with her hair and drinking her personal drinks with her GLOVES ON and then touching food disgusted me. Maybe that played a role in why I didn't think the food tasted that great...because of the people who were handling it. I threw out most of my food, honestly.

I'm usually willing to give a place a second chance if I have an off first visit but I honestly don't ever see myself going back to Ted's. Gross."}
{"text":"On the quest for the perfect hot dog, ted's fell well short of being....well, good. 

Getting straight to the food: hotdogs were run of the run, and largely flavorless; mine was topped with canned/boxed agent orange Mac and cheese. Also go onion rings that were near Impossible to eat due to thin cuts, oiled out crust, and lack of seasoning. 

I imagine this place is great if you are drunk, but not anything to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Ted's is simply amazing. I love a charbroiled hot dog & Ted's is one of the few places you can get one in the valley. I wish they had more around town, but it is well worth the drive. Their mustard is something that dreams are made of... horseradishy yellow. They have all the great toppings to make a superior dog, cheese, chile, sauerkraut, mustard!, pickles, etc . Although I am not a fan of their chile, but to each there own. Also, their onion rings are delish, fresh and hand battered. Ted's is definitely a place to stop every now and then... or everyday."}
{"text":"Today we decided Ted's would be a great place to eat lunch because we have heard about how good the dogs and brats are. This place definitely did not disappoint! The charbroiled dogs were cooked perfect, the milkshakes were thick and creamy just like grandma used to make, and the fries were fresh and crispy. To top it all off the staff were absolutely wonderful. They know how to make you feel valued as a customer and always find time to take a few moments to chat even when super busy. I am thoroughly impressed with this fabulous establishment and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Low quality, tasteless hot dog.  Definitely NOT worth the drive from East Mesa."}
{"text":"Everything about Ted's is mediocre. I had a hot dog, fries, and a vanilla malt. It was just average, run-of-the-mill food. The prices aren't that good either. I don't know what people see in this place. It doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Ya....You can tell this place is good by how long the line is every time.  Really good char broiled dogs and I really enjoy the white hot with onion rings. Hard to find this type of Hot Dog in Phoenix... Real Wood!   Love the Milkshakes."}
{"text":"II wish i could give 3 and a half stars!  The char broil taste on the food is excellent.. just like a bbq at the house.  The prices are so good that theres usually a line so long that i dont have time to wait!  Pretty good food if the lines are short."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, just wish the line was shorter be ready to wait for an hour if you decide to go here"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing,  that is not overkill. I am from Buffalo where Teds is a staple,  like 6 locations.  Fearing that the quality would not be up to snuff with the home town originals,  I had not tried this yet.  I kick myself for not going earlier because the quality of the food had carried over from the east coast! Charbroiled goodness..... Amazing brats, burgers,  and fries.  GET THE WHITE HOT SAUSAGE (part Veal, part pork) as it is the best thing on the menu.  Friendly staff and clean dining area.  They have pictures of Buffalo all over which brings me back. If you have not tried Teds you are missing out... Go now,  drop everything and hit the restaurant asap...seriously get on it.  Oh,  by the way I live in Tucson and drive up to Tempe just for lunch at Teds. It's that good."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been telling me about Ted's for a while and I finally decided to go. The food was great! I had a \"white hot\" dog, some onion rings and their longberry juice drink. Everything was SO good, especially the rings. I give this 4/5 because I felt the prices were a little high for what it was. Knowing that I can hit up Costco and get a polish with a drink for 1.50 makes it hard to spend $9 on my meal. Other than price, it was excellent and worth the wait in the long line."}
{"text":"Hands down, without a doubt, no question, the best hot dogs in the Phoenix area. Trust me when I tell you, don't listen to your Chicago friends who tell you about Portillo's, that place doesn't come close. Ted's does so much more than hot dogs. They have hamburgers, white hots, chili, ice cream shakes and much more. Stop your search right now and just take a trip to Ted's, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hotdogs were good nothing really special about hotdogs anyway, but great mac n cheese."}
{"text":"My review in June just after the remodel opening of Ted's was based on what appeared to be a very poor quality of furnishings. The owner informed me that it was temporary until new furnishings arrived. Perhaps signs posted to alert patrons of that fact would have been helpful and also, perhaps waiting until the proper furnishings had arrived before opening might have given a better first impression of the remodel. I don't think customers would have complained if it took a little longer to completely finish the job properly. The quality of their hot dogs and burgers is still excellent."}
{"text":"Great dogs here! Best dogs I've had in the Phoenix area. Love their fries too. Always fast and friendly service. So happy they accept debit/credit cards now as they used to be cash only. Very reasonable prices as well. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Can i give this place a ten star review. Its always packed always fresh the food is sooooo good the only downside is i live in north phoenix and this place is in tempe please build over here i will work for food hahaha"}
{"text":"What more can I say about Ted's that has not been said by everyone ?
If you like violence and prefer your food to be poked, prodded & charred, then this is the right place for you.  After the hot dog master took your order, your victim is then put into the grilling line.  You will get the satisfaction of seeing your hot dog being tortured into a grotesque but tasty form.  When it is done, you can ask the hot dog prep master to camouflage it with multitude of tasty condiments.  I highly suggest the home made chili or hot sauce.  Once you are done, go back to the line and go order some more doggy goodness."}
{"text":"The food here was decent, but not even close to worth the ordeal that is their ordering process. You start by ordering your food at the grill, but the menu is over by the register (at the end of the line). Next, you pick your toppings, but you have to specify what meat you got (which causes a mess when the cook is trying to give the worker one thing for someone else somewhere else in the line). While this is happening, you have other people asking if you want anything to drink. Then you get to the register and have to repeat your order, while having to be sure to add sides of fries or onion rings if no one in the beginning of the line happened to ask you. Not only does this take forever but it feels like you are constantly repeating the same order to every person down the line.

Because of the constant delays in this process, the fries get double fried, the milkshakes come out runny, and you end up spending 30 minutes in line behind 3 people.

You can get food on par with this from any other burger place. I would recommend skipping the hassle and just going there."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since '92 and I love their food.  They have made a few changes over the years that I don't agree with, but change is necessary.  The employees are courteous and the service is great.  It's amazing that the cook can remember all the orders he takes at one time without messing them up.  I would recommend to come before noon or between 1pm and 3pm on weekdays, or you will be waiting in a very long line.  Regardless, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good hot dog or hamburger."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the fuss is about this place.  The polish I ordered well done was barely warm on the inside and had big chunks of grissel in it.  The \"fresh\" onion rings were served cold.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"An all time favorite of my family and I. And I'm never one for dogs, burgers and pizza, but this one ... this is the exception.

The Venue: Small, somewhat old place in the same complex as SakeBomber. Plenty of parking. With indoor and outdoor seating. Clean and well maintained.

The Chow: Burgers, hotdogs, Polish, Brats, White Hots. Toppings the usual plus cheese, chili, grilled veg and sauerkraut for an additional fee. Fries and Onion Rings. Old school Milk Shakes.

REVIEW: Love the grilled offerings of Polish and White Hots. So delicious! The onion rings are awesome and the fries good. Heard the burgers are delicious too, bigger and of course cost a bit more than your fast food chain burger.

TIP: If you plan a trip, go early. Lines, no matter what day can get really long.  But if you do get there during peak, I can tell you it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"What can I say about Teds? Well, I can start with the fact that I am about 20 years old, coming here since I was 5, and although I don't live nearby, make a trip at least every other week just to eat food like back home back in New York. The line can be out the door 7 days a week, but you know you will be through in 10 minutes, with your order right. After all, it is being prepared RIGHT in front of you! Milkshakes are great, made to order. Onion rings are pure perfection, and although I never say no to onion rings for fries, the few times I have had them they are thin, not too oily, and the cheese dipping sauce is pure perfection. the closest you'll get in AZ to a Sabrett hot dog stand. A true gem!"}
{"text":"Damn this place is fantastic. It's another great Tempe example of a short order, Charcoal grilled fast food joint. The sausages our particularly fantastic while the hamburgers are actually pretty mediocre.

What really sets this place apart is the onion rings. I call them onion rings but that is really not doing them justice. It is more like taking a handful of chopped onions and dunking them in batter before dropping them in hot oil. So good.

I've not had one but my friend I've gone with says the milkshakes are fantastic as well"}
{"text":"I grew up around Detroit eating great hot dogs and coneys.  This was my third trip to 
Ted's and I have to say \"yuck\".  I had a footlong which was tasteless and the bun dry.  I guess people like these because they load them with toppings and it gives them flavor. I've had the chili in the past and it is pretty disappointing.   Sorry, Ted.  I can grill a primo hot dog in my backyard for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here for some time and finally did so today. It was a long but fast moving line of those with sausages ordering to eat the same. If you a young lady on the prowl this is the place for you. The all beef dog was perfect!!!! The cheese fries were yummy.  All for less than seven bucks. A great lunch. I plan on going back on Monday for a brat."}
{"text":"I imagine this was your standard eatery before the fast food burger revolution of the 60s. Hot Dogs are definitely under served in the valley, because every time I go to Ted's or Costco I have to wait in a line. If you have a hankering for a dog and a pile of greasy fries you will like it. I seem to side with most of the other reviewers, this place doesn't blow my mind, just a solid choice."}
{"text":"Hot dogs that are worth the wait! This place knows how to do hotdogs right and very tasty! If you're going to order the fries make sure to add cheese and chili on the side. As for the milkshake I couldn't distinguish Loganberry from the strawberry but either way it was a must have add on. Ted's has a basic concept but a special delivery and a fun experience."}
{"text":"charbroiled and great - rolls are fresh and soft - toppings are always fresh - will return anytime - just like Buffalo"}
{"text":"Ted's dogs are the bet.net but they are................CLOSED for renovations until mid-June.
Jimmy's Dog's for now and they're good, but no Ted's!"}
{"text":"Not too many Hot Dog joints around so it's easy to say it's one of the better ones.
Just a little pricey (for a hot dog)... but it's a CASH ONLY place!!! What the crap is up with that? Ted, you gotta fix that. I don't even carry cash anymore.
That said, the rings and fries a better than average. They'll fix you a good shake.
And they fire roast it up right in front of your eyes.
I would give it 4 start on taste alone, but the cash only and usually long lines bring it back just a little bit."}
{"text":"This place has really good all beef hot dogs and burgers . The milkshakes are good too , been coming here for over 15 years. It's good to see the same guy on the grill , he's been here forever. Even though the line is usually really long , it goes by fast."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Teds. Everything is so good. It's always busy so that should say something about this place."}
{"text":"Ted's is basically awesome.  Obviously come here for the hotdogs and some more things like white-hot or brats, but fries and onion rings are outstanding too. The prices are low and the place is plain but it's an institution in the area and simply fantastic. I think it's the best hotdogs in the area you can find.

There is one downside, and I considered whether it rated a four star or a five-star because of this. The lines can be really really long if you go during normal meal times. Their system for ordering cooking and paying for food is just not very efficient. If you know that going in it's no big deal. Obviously even knowing this I decided they were worth five stars."}
{"text":"Best hotdogs in town.  Fries are served hot and everything always tastes fresh and made to order.  The only thing wrong with this place is there aren't more locations!"}
{"text":"You wanna hot dog? This is where you get a hot dog. I was raised in Brooklyn and went to high school near Coney Island so I am well acquainted with Nathan's and this place is just as good. LOVE the onion rings and the fact they have sauerkraut for your hot dogs scores major points."}
{"text":"I really love a good hot dog and Ted's does just about the best version of it around here.  I LOVE the hot sauce on the dogs.  The shakes are good too.  The onion rings are not my favorite they are to shoe stringy.  I prefer thicker cut onion rings.  The fries are decent.  My son LOVES the corn dogs and the white hots while my daughter prefers the foot long."}
{"text":"Even though I'm from Chicago and love Vienna Hot dogs, you can't go wrong with Teds.  You are overcome by the open fire grill the minute you walk in the door.  Everything is home made.  I love the foot long and brats.  When I'm not watching my weigh, the onion rings and fries are great too."}
{"text":"I've always loved their food and a Hot Dog lover, however a few months ago I became vegetarian....Anyway, found out they have Veggie dogs and like veggie dogs in general....OMG, so good and so happy that a place like Ted's has evolved to current times and cater to people who are vegetarian...They're a real hot dog company, if only QT would now sell Veggie dogs, I'd be real happy. Love their fries a lot as well. SUPER YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix on a road trip and found Ted's on road food.com. Rated as Legendary 5/5. It did not disappoint. Friendly staff, amazing onion rings, yummy sauces, fun hot dog styles."}
{"text":"Nice hotdogs. So many choices of topping. However, the onion rings are not that delicious. I got cold onion rings, but the dog is hot enough."}
{"text":"The store had a sort of fun vibe, you get to watch while the dogs are grilled and it smells good. The food wasn't good though, especially compared to the other hot dog place on Broadway. Also, it was kind of dirty inside and the cashier was rude."}
{"text":"I no longer eat meat but when I did, this place was a yummy treat! Footlongs, regulars, all beef, specialties...corn dogs, onion rings, fries. And lots of toppings! I can't say that eating here would change your life but it's a fun place to eat and it definitely shakes up having  regular hot dogs at home with mustard. They have lots of yummy fresh toppings (big pickle slices, kraut, tomatoes, chili, cheese, peppers, etc...) and they cook them right in front of you. Best part....super super cheap! I hate going to a hot dog place that costs a fortune...where you might as well have gone to a sit down restaurant. Ted's is very tastey; thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a place where hot dog dreams come true. I currently have ulcerative colitis and im still going to teds tomorrow. Id rather have bad diarrhea then a bad hot dog. Portillos is a wet turd."}
{"text":"This was really disappointing, especially after the positive Yelp reviews.

The onion rings were made fresh. However, I've made better at home (and on my first and only try). The batter was bland and tasted \"oily,\" if it had a flavor at all. The actual onion pieces were cut too small to have a good mouth-feel.

The charred beef jumbo hot dog I ate was okay. It was buried under a pleasant mountain of toppings--I asked for \"everything\"--and this was nice. The bun was typical; nothing that went above and beyond the Wal-Mart buns-in-a-bag experience.

I also had a jumbo burger. 1/3 pound. It was cooked okay; medium-rare in parts, medium in others. I suspect they were trying for medium. The toppings were acceptable and the bun was pretty good. The meat itself tasted unseasoned, but was fine. 

We had a milkshake, too. Loganberry. Theoretically. It tasted like strawberry, and when I asked for confirmation that it was not strawberry, the staff offered to remake it. Okay, I thought this may be a gambit to save face--fine, let's let them remake the drink. I was told that they'd bring it out to us, so I sat down at the table. We were later \"greeted\" by an employee carrying our milkshake. She slammed it down on the table without comment (slopping some of it over the edge of the cup), and spun on her heel and returned to the service line. 

All in all ... I really, really, really hope they had an \"off night.\" We won't be going back, which is sad--all I wanted was a tasty hot dog served by folks who were friendly. I don't care that I'm being fleeced for a hot dog; I'll pay $4 for one if it is good and comes with quality service and preparation. If our evening is any indication, Ted's Hot Dogs has a long way to go with staff training and quality of sides. I appreciate that QSRs are hard things to staff well, but just hiring folks that are somewhat friendly and want customers to come back may be a good start."}
{"text":"If Teds existed in the burgeoning void of sanity that is know as Los Angeles it would be called Pinks and people would wait in lines around the building for two hours to eat here.  Thank Christ it doesn't because you can stroll right in, order two split grilled dogs, rings and a coke, pay ten bucks and feast till you are in a food coma. Teds is seriously one of the better charbroiled grills i have been to, it can get a little busy but it is worth ANY wait.  They have all the fixins, mustard, onions, peppers, relish, mayo... pretty much anything you could ever want your porky goodness to swim in."}
{"text":"Some of the best hotdogs In The valley. A tad slow on the service but I guess charbroiled perfection takes time. Make sure to get there before or after lunch rush or you'll be stuck for a while.

Same applies to dinner: usually the place starts getting really busy at 5.

Ps. Their milkshakes aren't half bad, make sure to get vanilla, the chocolate ones are just vanilla with God awful Hershey's syrup."}
{"text":"2 stars because the burger was good. The cashier was not very friendly.  I don't like feeling like a damn cashier is doing me a favor by taking my money when the fact that I spend my money there pays her salary, which she obviously doesn't deserve. Also, their burgers are 1/6 lb patties. Skinniest burgers ever! A triple bacon cheese burger, which consists of 1/2 lb of beef, 3 slices of American Cheese, and 2 small strips of bacon costs $8.63!!!  Rip off! In N Out, Whataburger, Sonic, Chuck Box, Wendy's & Carl's Jr all have tasty burgers that are a much better value. I'm sorry to say that Ted's is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the Ted's in Tempe after stumbling upon it when visiting the Buffalo, NY area. I was shocked to hear them say \"we have a location in Tempe!\". Since then, it's been on my list to go and we finally did.

They have a lot of options for their dogs, and even for those who want to get a burger. If you're going to a hotdog place, I'm not sure why you'd want a burger, but hey people are weird these days. They also had a vegetarian option, which is cool for you healthy folks. I got their jumbo dog with lettuce, tomato, onion, hot sauce and pickles. If it sounds like a lot, it is, but that's what makes it great. Tons of options and ways to turn your average dog into a top-notch dog. They also had excellent fries and onion rings for sides. 

Overall, lots of options, tasty food and a pretty decent price. You could have a nice meal for under $6 if you wanted to. That's always a big plus! I'll definitely try to make it back there if I'm in that part of town."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of coming here, only because I'm not the biggest hot dog fan in the world. Sure, I'll enjoy a hot dog and beer at a baseball game or while out camping, but it just never really sounds that appealing to me outside of those settings. Well Ted's changed all of that. The hot dogs Ted's serves are amazing. I love everything about this place. The retro vibe, the big grill right in front of the customers, the hot sauce.. The list goes on and on. I highly recommend the white hot with mustard, ketchup, cheese sauce, and hot sauce and the regular hot dog with mustard, ketchup, onion, & a pickle. Both the fries and the onion rings are great so you can't go wrong with either. Also recommend getting some cheese to go along with said fries!"}
{"text":"Love me some teds hot dogs! Been going here since high school and it's a sure thing for good hamburgers and hot dogs. They recently remodeled and made a few upgrades to the menu. Creepy grill guy with the mustache has worked there for over 20 years lol."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people wait 30+ minutes for a fast food hotdog. OK, maybe Gene and Jude's (if you've been drinking) but not this place. I keep trying different sausages to see if any of them are any good but they're not. On the other hand, the onion rings are amazing. But no onion ring is worth a 30 minute wait. Open more Portillo's in the Valley!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live just a couple miles away from this place, so we've driven by it countless times. But we never stopped in because we were thinking, \"It's just hot dogs, how good could it really be?\" That is, until today. Being the official National Hot Dog Day we figured we'd finally give it a try - and wow, we were missing out. 

The first thing we noticed was how busy it was for a weekday afternoon, with a line going nearly out the door! Even with a long line, the menu had so many choices we still hadn't decided by the time we got to the front. They had an insane amount of options just for toppings, but what immediately caught my eye was two of my favorite things in the food world - mac & cheese, and bacon. I was a little skeptical at first using mac & cheese as a topping for a hot dog, thinking it would taste really processed or too mushy like at other places, but it was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the same but got the foot-long whereas I got the regular size, and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. The only complaint we had was the price was a little expensive for what it was, but we were still fairly satisfied.

If the rest of their menu is even half as good as what we had today - there were burgers, ice cream, soups for the fall season - then we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Try to find a better hotdog in AZ!   If you are feeling it, try their white hot dogs.   Hard to find and absolutely worth seeking out.    Just like upstate NY."}
{"text":"I've downgraded Ted's unfortunately.  In the many times I have gone back, when I have had the footlong, every time I've been disappointed.  I remember it tasting better.  I think it just tastes funky. I don't know if they don't cook it enough.  I also have had the White Hot Dog made of veal- that was forgettable.  I'm sticking to the All Beef.  Cheese Fries are still awesome however."}
{"text":"Awesome.


Good all beef dogs/brauts/polish sausage, good toppings, awesome fries, good shakes, pretty good stuff.  They also make their own hot sauce.

Only complaint: Store bought hot dog   buns - they don't try to hide it or anything, but seeing the bag of Rainbow, or Aunt Haddys, or whatever it was, just kills it a little bit. 

Homemade buns  would be cool, but this place is pretty great. I like the  dining area as well. Just simple, bright, and clean."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great hotdogs and burgers. The loganberry shake is really good. They can get really busy but the lines usually moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Eh, not so good...
Mediocre food.  Honestly, I do not understand all the hype about this place.  I have had infinately better from a street stand.  Skimp on the condiments but their new dips are pretty good.  The fries and onion rings are lousy and service is slow.   Ted's is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Buffalo hot dogs in Arizona? YES PLEASE! We were so excited that there was a Ted's in Phoenix. If you haven't been yet you need to stop by and try out one of their delicious hot dogs. They're cooked perfectly and have that tell tale snap as you bite into them. You can top them with pretty much anything you could want and they have loganberry as a choice for drinks- perfect combo! I also grabbed their mac and cheese and it is just like Stouffer's which I happen to love. 

The best part was that Buffalonians flock here. While we were in line at least three other Buffalo natives stopped in to get their hot dog fix. It was really fun to talk with some of the Phoenix and Buffalo locals about how crazy different the weather is from climate to climate and you can tell that Ted's isn't just about the food, it also brings the community together and sparks conversations.

Come to Ted's you'll be happy you did!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Teds a couple of times and like it a lot. The chili dogs are really good and come in 6 in or 12 in. It gets really busy and the line can be long at times but seems to go fast. The only thing I don't like is the feeling of being rushed when you order but other then that it is worth the hustle. The onion rings and shakes are really good too. The menu is very simple with just a few things on it and instead of having a ton of food they picked to perfect the few items they do have. I would recommend trying this place at least once and I think you will be hooked."}
{"text":"I go here for the smell- really. 

I show up just to stand in the lazy broken line, while listening to golden oldies on archaic speakers and bathing in the majestic vapors of percolating chargrilled meats. It's a serendipitous slice of Americana that had previously been reserved for a pleasant valley Sunday sometime before I was born.

and it's available nearly any day of the week right here in sunny Tempe, Arizona.


......' ERE."}
{"text":"Ted's has the best hotdogs in Arizona, bar none.

The line at lunch can be a little long, but it is worth the wait.  

You can't go wrong with a jumbo all beef and an order of onion rings."}
{"text":"Onions, hot sauce, mustard, & a pickle to crunch on. Mmm! It's so good. To set the meal off -cheesy bacon fries really get the job done. Can't beat it. They have the best of both worlds here."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a summer dog. Good food, fast which is amazing given how popular they are and they have a fair amount of variety on their menu."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place but the help moves so slow it takes forever to get through the line. I never seen six people behind the counter get nothing accomplished.  It was like they were all heavily medicated. No motivation whatsoever. The cook took one order at a time and still didn't get it right.  
I doubt this old establishment will stay in business. Very sad 
I know I won't be back
Oh and the food that use to be good not so much. My hotdog was just burnt and not cooked all the way through. The onion rings and fries were a bag of grease. 
Not to mention the code violations too many to list. 
There was just no supervision over the kids working here. And they seemed to care less about customer service or doing a good job."}
{"text":"being from upstate New York craving a white hot hits me often, and TED'S hits the spot.  Charbroil their hot dogs taste great and who doesn't want a loganberry shake to go with that perfectly grilled hot dog."}
{"text":"Went to Ted's for dinner the other night, got a foot long with fries. The hot dog had a  char on the outside, but the overall flavor was a little too sweet for my taste, which I think was brought on by the peppers and onions. The fries were really good though. I'm not sure if I'll will bingo back, but if I did I would probably try the polish. Overall Ted's was ok...."}
{"text":"Who knew Hotdogs could have a cult following? Well they do at Ted's, a Tempe landmark. Try the Brats or Polish or Italian Sausage if you're ready for the next step up."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years. Always loved them. Last few times have been so so. Still has good service.  They have expanded their menu which I jhave not tried their new items. 

Brats were a little tougher and buns soggy my last visits. Don't know why. Cooked more or high humidity. ..IDK. 

Fries were average in the past but the last 2 tines they're not hot. I couldn't eat em. 

Overall a good change of pace but just not as good as I thought it was."}
{"text":"I know that Ted's has been a Hot Dog institution in Tempe since like the 80's BUT, it's just okay. If you're a nostalgia fanatic you will love this place. If you like your food with more of modern twist this place isn't 'for you. I ate here today just after the big lunch rush and was underwhelmed. This was like my third visit and it seem like each time is less enjoyable.  This time I had the foot long chill cheese dog with peppers and a medium Logan Berry drink for $7.31. Granted I do like how the hot dogs are char grilled but I don't think that's enough to keep me coming here on a regular. I will say the brats are really good and one of kind, I like those and I'll stick to that when I come here.  Don't worry about good customer service either because the lady yelling at you \"what do you want?\" while you're in line will make you feel warm and fuzzy (I kid, but really that's the ordering process)."}
{"text":"I love Ted's! Just ask for your dog extra done if you like it charred and charcoal-y like I do. I love their hot relish, and if you ask for \"everything,\" you'll get everything BUT ketchup: just the way it should be.

Their chili is delicious! Tip: if you ask for the chili or cheese on the side, you get more for the same price. They do offer Udi's gluten-free buns now, which is awesome, but I've gotten in the habit of just asking for no bun and using a knife and fork...basically, you can't go wrong eating a Ted's dog."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in Phoenix, hands down. Very nice atmosphere and dogs are grilled right in front of you. What it great about this place is that it is a family owned business and you can see historic pictures from the original place in New York. A can't miss in Tempe."}
{"text":"Made a point to stop by here whilre driving through because of my fellow yelper ratings. Ugh! What a terrible hot dog and brat. Chili dog was just bad and so was the brat that my husband ordered.  He absolutely LOVES hot dogs, so for him to lnot even finish eating eat and want to leave to go to in n out is a BAD sign.  The only consolation is the onionrings which by the way are excellent. What a shame."}
{"text":"We love Ted's! The manager Keith is always very kind to us when we have lunch. The restaurant was recently remodeled and looks great and the food is ALWAYS delicious."}
{"text":"Ok so the vegetarian went into the hot dog shop...

My friends dig this place quite a bit. I can even admit to liking the old school vibe of the place.  The staff are friendly although they do roll their eyes at ordering a \"veggie dog\" sometimes, but that is probably involuntary so we'll let it slide.  There always seems to be a line but it's not too bad of a wait to get your food. I have to give them props for having a vegetarian option for those of us who still like to hang out with meat eating friends.  The \"veggie\" dogs are cooked with the other meat so if you are super strict vegetarian then you may want to skip it. I do not have those qualms so I get mine with the homemade hot sauce and cheese.  They are pretty good for a veggie dog and oddly authentic tasting. Nothing to write home about, but hey what can you do? They have two excedingly awesome things if the meat or \"veggie\" dogs freak you out, the onion rings and the milk shakes.

Try:
- Onion Rings \"Crispy\"
- Milk Shakes"}
{"text":"Charcoal.. sure it's a smoky flavor that makes this place special, so what, it's worth coming to.  Why, well, rats swatted off batman, as someone visiting the area, this place doesn't necessary make me want to stop; but that's probably the beauty of a shoppe that doesn't need to advertise to get it's clientele inside. 

So what is it, it's a bratwurst.. maybe it's the foot long of meat.. in a tubed shape, that is shoved onto a hot charcoal grill.  Maybe it's the toppings, and all the cheese that you should also layer on top... and fries.   They also have some really good shakes and they seem to have plenty of thickness to withstand their own review.  

Apparently, they are from Buffalo, NY; and the last time I was in Buffalo, I didn't try it...  but I'm glad it was on my menu of items to eat, because I think it's worth it.. and throw some chili on it too... hell, put everything on your dog... it's a meal in itself."}
{"text":"This going to be a complaint. It's nice to know that an order of 20 gets preferential treatment over the rest of the lunch time crowd. I love your guys, but that is awful customer service."}
{"text":"Being from Buffalo myself YOMP; YOMP... (k... that is something we did in Buff... I know exceedingly DORKY! ) TEDS Hot DOGS are the BEST all around Hot Dog.. BEST in the World as my mom would Say!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place of all time. I would brag about here to friends.. \"you haven't had a hot dog until you tried Ted's!!\" The owner was so passionate about this place.. last time I saw him he was almost 87; enjoying a hot dog at his own restaurant. I came in tonight after 2 years of loving out of state. The place looks the same.. but it's a complete joke. There is posters everywhere about the \"new triple burger\" and other fast food nonsense. 

It turned into a wendys. Food quality dropped. My onion rings are awful. Service was the worst thing I have ever seen. They never put my dog even on the grill. This used to have the best service ever. 

When I was in college I moved to the apartments across the street just so I could enjoy my favorite hot dog.  RIP Spearo; miss you as the owner. Now it's just a sub par hot dog stand in Buffalo"}
{"text":"The best hot dogs around and the fries are to die for. Anyone who loves hot dogs needs to eat at Ted's, and that's all I have to say about that :)"}
{"text":"Ted's Hot Dogs is one of those places that just emits an aura of times long gone. When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of \"Ted's Hot Dogs\" found in Buffalo New York. 

The line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.

The onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.

Since I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.

I ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.

My overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog. I am going to give Ted's Hot Dogs four stars and a recommendation if you happen to be in Tempe Arizona."}
{"text":"The food is delicious & the atmosphere fun! If you're a hot dog & burger lover like myself, I would highly recommend checking this place out! They grill your food right in front of you & you can pick out exactly what toppings you want. It's a good price for the quality & portions you get & really very affordable! Because of the ordering style be prepared to wait a little bit while the food is cooked & the guests ahead of you pick out their toppings. As long as you're not in a hurry, next time you have a hot dog or burger craving this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Phoenix, hands down.. The dogs are all grilled upon order, right in front of you! For $10 you can get a jumbo foot-long (with anything on it), large fries, and a large drink.. Great spot for America's favorite wieners.. *With a splash of Buffalo, New York to it*"}
{"text":"This place is great. Authentic onion rings and great fries. The dogs are super good because they char grill them to order. Bun quality etc. is perfect. Portillo's is better for sausage or beef sandwiches or salads... but Ted's is the best place I know of for hot dogs."}
{"text":"I used to live next door to Ted's and I had to have it at least once a week. The hot dogs are fantastic, the onion rings are delicious, corn dogs are superb. Fries could be better though. Only downside: They only accept cash so a ER trip to the ATM may be in order."}
{"text":"I am not a \"5 star\" giver. I usually always feel something could have been better. Not at Ted's! Every time I go, I feel like I have just had the freshest fast food ever! 

The service is fast and friendly, and I like seeing the same manager and cooks on the line; no matter who it is though, they cook my bratwurst and fries perfectly.

The charbroil taste of all the meats and old-fashioned atmosphere is so American, you want to go into Ted's wrapped in an American Flag. The ambiance is bright and cheery, but very 70s, and very inviting when you're in the mood for good, old fashioned BBQ (as in the grill, not the sauce!) taste.

The authentic charbroil cooking will always outdo any fast food in Arizona. Best of all, Ted's is probably the cheapest place one can get a hamburger/hot dog/other meat + fries + coke meal. Their cheese sauce does wonders to their fries, and I still have not figured out how they have perfected their french fries. I really can't complain about Ted's!

I might have given them 4 stars before they had a cash only rule, but now they accept credit cards, so 5 stars it is!

Overall: perfect for an American fast food lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and we finally decided to come here after church. Just in time right before lunch time rush! Service was quick and fast so the line moved quickly.

We got 2 regular hotdogs and 1 brat and 1 polish! And fries. I live the burnt hotdog/sausage skin... So yummy :) idk if my salt tolerance is going down but i thought that the brat got really salty towards the end... Still yummy tho..

Glad to eat at Ted's again!

Coke goes so well with hotdog and fries :)"}
{"text":"This place was ok.  They have a good selection of dogs.

My wife really likes it, as well as a couple of family members.

I on the other hand am not too big of a fan of charred hotdogs.

Either way, the food there is ok.  The lines are a bit too long for me."}
{"text":"Best Feature: The Footlong

The almighty mecca of truth and love and minced pigs!!!  How can you NOT give this a 5 star!?  Fie on you all who doubt the raw power of the Ted's Hotdog!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times.  Smell of grilled dogs fills the air and it's great.  The (basic) hot dog is pretty good.  Haven't tried the brat or other varieties yet.  But the shoestring style onion rings are the bomb!  They don't open too late to plan your dog craving accordingly.  And oh yeah, they have Buffalo and New York papers from weeks past to satisfy your curiosity of what news from the right-coast reads like."}
{"text":"Buffalo regular and jumbo beef hot dogs. Allegedly the best hot dogs. I like jumbo beef one for sure. The price is pretty economic. We drove half an hour here just want to have a few hot dogs for dinner."}
{"text":"Way overrated!!! They are using cheap weiners - NOT BEEF hotdogs. Weiners are just thrown on the grill and then into a hard bun. There is nothing spectacular about this place. You are better off buying Hebrew National and grilling it yourself. These are not coney dogs like Detroit Coney Grill down the street or James Coney Island hotdogs. Price is too expensive and the taste is awful - absolutely no flavor. You can't even taste the char because of the cheap weiner."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this before? I've been coming here for at least 10 years now and we recently came back now that they have finished the renovation. Honestly, it's not all that different, cleaner walls and new video menu boards but the food is still excellent.

The best thing about Ted's is that they grill the hotdogs. This gives them a better flavor than your typical boiled dog. And they have lots of toppings, including mac and cheese, which turns out to be delicious. They also have excellent onion rings and fries, and you can get an order of \"frings\" which is a combination of both and more than enough for two people.

Here's the tip for customers, start looking at the menu when you get in line because the workers won't wait for you to get to the counter, they're looking for you to yell your order while in line so they can get it started. However, a tip for the restaurant is; once you get an order figure out a way to pass it down the line so that people don't have to repeat themselves. This last time that we were there my wife ordered chili cheese fries and no less than four people on the line asked her if she wanted the chili on top or on the side. Figure it out people! Maybe drive over to The Chuckbox and see how they use toothpicks in a code to let the other employees know what customers have ordered.

But overall, Ted's is a great place for people, like me, who like hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Here for Az bikeweek 2015 & had a craving for a hot dog and turned to yelp and here I am. Food is cooked on a fire burning grill. Everything is fresh and made quick. I will definitely be back next time in Az."}
{"text":"Plain and simple. Nothing here it's eccentric or different, just some dogs. The service was horrible, if you come on a lunch rush you can plan on waiting over 35min just to place your order. When I went in they had either a rookie at cashier or a teenage girl who hated her job because she couldn't have been slower or more rude. I hate to give it 2 but that wait time is no joke, and for hotdog I can make at home it absurd, they should consider getting another cashier register."}
{"text":"I just received my August email from Ted's which reminded me that I need to write a review. In there email this month there is a coupon for a free regular dog with the purchase of a grilled item and a drink. Anyway...

We came for dinner one night (National Hot Dog Day to be exact...no deals though) and we got there early enough that the line wasn't long at all. If you have never been, be prepared to wait in line. It usually moves fast enough but this isn't the place you want to go when you are in a time crunch.

I usually get the all beef, but I got a regular dog this time. It was a a decent dog but I will be switching back the all beef. My hubby got a foot long. We shared an order of onion rings (but I'm sure I could have eaten one order to myself). They are the onion sting type, crunchy and wonderful.  We ordered a couple kids meals with corn dogs and fries. Everything is made fresh so if you go the corn dog route with your kids be warmed that they are fresh out of the fryer and you will need to let them cool. Kid's meals come with a drink and the hubby and I shared a regular drink. Our total came to just over $20. Refills on drinks are .25.

It's nice to have a little piece of New York in Tempe...I just wish I made it there more often."}
{"text":"We were out in Tempe today so I planned a swing by Ted's for lunch.  I have driven by it for 20 years and never stopped before.  

We arrived with only 2-3 people ahead of us in line.  Our order was promptly taken and our food was on the grill in no time.  We then proceeded to order fries and onion rings.  This was sort of overkill since the portions are quite large.  

I ordered a regular burger and it was tasty but the patty was thin.  My wife had the foot long hotdog and couldn't finish it all.

The place is clean and the walls are covered with awards from years past.  

Overall:  Great service, Good quality food, Clean and well kept dining area, Good value for the money.

I am sure that the owners opened a location in Tempe so they could visit in the winter time and write off the trip as a business trip.."}
{"text":"You want a really good hot dog and onion rings? THIS IS YOUR PLACE! The service is awesome (they treat you like family) and honestly I don't care for onion rings but theirs is to die for. Do yourself a favor and just go there, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"So I finally got around to trying Ted's. It was pretty tasty. I got the white hot which was pretty good. It didn't really have a lot of flavor though. I also got the Chili dog. That was pretty tasty. I wasn't sure about the nacho cheese looking stuff, but it was better then expected. I think next time I will try the polish dog.. The onion rings were delicious. I think I will be back again just for those! The line was pretty long, so be prepared to wait a little. They also get your order before you get to the actual ordering spot, so make sure you know what you want quickly!"}
{"text":"Don't think I have to say much about Ted's. All the bad reviews they get are by clowns that would not know a good hot dog if it slapped them in the face. Bottom line is that these are the best dogs we have in the Phx metropolitan area. I have been going there for over 15 years and have gotten the same quality and service as i did the first time. So, if its a great dog your looking for Ted's in the place. You'll be glad you tried it."}
{"text":"If you're gonna eat a hot dog, you should get a Ted's cuz there's no comparison.  Take wiener schnitzel for example, they boil the wieners, Teds grills it over a real BBQ. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Ted's rules.  Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Ted's on many, many occasions over the years and continue to stop by when in the mood. Hot dogs are consistently above the norm. There are other variations in the Valley that are also very good but Ted's has its own unique flavor and texture. Prices are fair and the ambiance is \"old school.\" Don't expect to be waited on but the staff is always courteous. I like the all beef with mustard, onion and pickle. How much more \"all American hot dog\" can you get? Some places use gimmicks and bizarre hot dog creations to attract. You won't find those at Ted's. We enjoyed Ted's again this week and the reason I am not giving 5 stars is their onion rings seem to have become a bag full of little crunchy things lately. Years ago they were large, juicy rings with a tasty batter. Our recent experiences with them have been a little disappointing... too many little crunchies. We will continue to patronize when in the mood."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that are good because they simply been doing the same thing forever. The food isn't fancy. The toppings aren't new. The hot dogs are just done right.  Everything is inside from the tables to the grill have been in there since opening. The meat comes from Buffalo, NY and the grill is well seasoned from years of grilling. Thus making the best hot dog and brats in town."}
{"text":"The hot dogs just weren't that good.   Tasted like ones you get from the supermarket.  Wanted to like it, but really just bleh."}
{"text":"Its a hot dog place, I wish I could say more, but it was kinda disappointing for the price you pay. I had the all beef dog with mac & Chili and the half & talk \"fries & onion rings.\" Its kinda like a classier gas station hot dog and toppings. The fries and onion rings are like crunchy fired particles and the dog was something I can do better at my own home. 

I'll save my money for something better next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ted's is definitely one of my happy places. Deliciously made to order grilled hot dogs and burgers, delectable toppings, tasty sides, scrumptious milkshakes and loganberry soda. What more could a person ask for from a hot dog joint?! My only complaint is that their portions are so generous I can ever finish my meal in one sitting. De-lic-ious. If you appreciate a good hot dog and are looking for filling meal made with quality ingredients, Ted's is for you."}
{"text":"Good hotdog, nice diner. Great onion rings!"}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best hot dogs I've ever had.  

It always amazes me how awesome the grill master is there.  He gets your order well in advance so he can fire up the dogs with ample time to have it ready for you as you pay.  The selection of condiments is very diverse as well.  I always like to enjoy the delicious onion rings as well!

Really, you can't go wrong at Ted's.  The only thing that may seem to turn you away is the line can get long around lunchtime.  But, that line is very deceiving because they move along quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome! Charcoal grilled hot dogs of multiple sizes and varieties.
The line looks intimidating but moves pretty quickly. Be prepared because the grill guy will ask for your order pretty quickly so that they can get a jump start on prepping your dog/sausage.
My only complaint would be that the chili was lacking a bit of flavor and I should have asked for more onion, but those complaints would be nitpicking. 
Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Very good char on the dog. 1/2 fries 1/2 onion strings, Chipotle ranch dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Ted's is worth the fat and calories. I do love the veggie hot dog and fresh onion rings are the best!"}
{"text":"Everything was made fresh to order. The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was excellent! Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an \"off\" night, but I just went here with my family and the experience leaves me wondering if I'll ever go back.  The prices are rather steep for what you get, most toppings cost extra and the food really isn't all that great.  

I didn't have a single \"ring\" in any of my onion rings, only small, overcooked pieces (looked nothing like the pictures others have posted).  The staff seemed bothered to help anyone and simply rushed people through the line, even though it wasn't particularly busy.  

The hotdogs were decent, but certainly nothing special.  I had a jumbo beef chili cheese dog and a pseudo-Chicago dog (everything but the sport peppers and poppy seed bun, because they don't offer them) myself.  I also tried the white and polish sausages that other family members were eating.  Truth be told, the sausages were the best of the bunch.  

The chili was a generic beef-only sauce and the liquid cheese was very plain.  The french fries arrived dry and unsalted, but not particularly crispy.  They tasted \"ok\" once they were doctored up, but these aren't the type of fries you \"crave\" later.  The shakes are very expensive for the small size you get and the chocolate shake tasted just like powdered chocolate milk, which I found disappointing.  The Loganberry shake, however, was very good.  

Unfortunately, for what you end up paying for a pair of hot dogs and a soda, I can go to much nicer eateries and have a higher quality meal that actually tastes great.

When it comes down to it, there are so many hot dog joints popping up all over the valley that it's quite easy to find somewhere better than Ted's.  The only thing they really have going for them is a recognizable name and a great location in the busy area of Tempe.  

Unless you have no other choice, I recommend you save your money and get your hot dog fix somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great bratwursts and hot dogs. Customizable. Made right in front of you in line. Great atmosphere. Good casual first date spot or to bring with you on a picnic!"}
{"text":"it seems like someone read my review and took to heart the too thin onion rings...........

last time i went, i could actually pick them up and dip 'em in ketchup instead of them breaking in2 crumbles."}
{"text":"Just the best hotdog ever!  Try a footlong or a white hot!  French fries with malt vinegar!  Wash it all down with an ice cold loganberry!"}
{"text":"Best hot dog you'll ever eat. Hands down. No argument.  Pumped they now take credit cards! The line goes fast, don't leave because there always is a line.  So worth it. Onion Rings are great. Ted never disappoints."}
{"text":"MmmmMMMhhh! Seriously good. Everything is made right in front of you with plenty of toppings to choose from. Delicious charbroiled styled dogs and crispy fries? Check. Another great place to try again? Check!"}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, I am a former Western New Yorker now living in Phoenix. There are certain \"comfort\" foods that I can not find here in Phoenix, good hot dogs, a good fish fry, Beef on 'Weck, thick crust pizza, Anderson's ice cream (people from the Buffalo area know exactly what I am talking about).
About 12 years, the COO of the company I managed took me out to lunch for my birthday. I did a double take when he pulled into Ted's. It was like I was home!
To be able to eat a Ted's dog  slightly charred and covered with their famous hot sauce was just like reliving my time spent in Buffalo, where most Saturday's lunch was stopping at one of the many Ted's in the area. To taste the flavor of that Sahlen's hot dog was food heaven. 
That was 12 years ago, and Ted's is always a go to place for lunch. My wife even will say, \"let's go to Ted's, I want a char grilled dog\". I have tasted all their various kinds of dogs and sausages and they are all excellent quality and flavor.There is something special about a dog cooked over charcoal. However, I have never had a hamburger there. If I want a burger, I will go to a burger joint.
Enjoy Ted's fellow foodies! I have been eating at Ted's here in Tempe for 12 years on a regular basis and have never been disappointed. Once you bite into a Ted's hot dog and get that slight \"snap\", you know you are about to eat a excellent quality tasting hot dog."}
{"text":"I live super close to Ted's, and have been wanting to try it since forever because of the high ratings from Yelp and people I know. Unfortunately, it did not even come close to my high expectations. 

Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of having my hot dog burnt, which I guess is what char-grilled means. Which I was unaware of how they usually cooked their hot dogs. My mistake.

The dude behind the counter grillin it up was really nice, which is why I gave it two stars. However, the wait was excruciating long for the food to taste as bad as it did. I ordered a Mac and cheese dog to go with a side of fries. I almost forgot I ordered fries because they really lacked uniqueness to me. And the dog just took over my thoughts anyway. 

So it was burnt. Like I said. I had to peel off the black skin around the dog for it to be edible. Then, since I got my dog to go, by the time I got home (literally 2 minutes later) my bun was all soggy from the Mac and cheese. As a suggestion, if they order it to go maybe just put it on the side and let them put it on. 

The Mac and cheese was also disappointing. I'm thinking I'm getting some actual cooked pasta, when really it tasted like easy mac. I'm a Mac and cheese lover and that was just so sad to me. 

I'm really sorry that I had to write this review because I just heard amazing things about this place. Maybe it was just my experience but yeah, I won't be going there ever again."}
{"text":"Been coming here since 1987!  Beat quality hot dogs around.  Don't be scared by the wait it's always worth it.  The onion rings are huge and crispy.  Even thought it's a popular location the prices are low and fair.  Don't forget a shake!!!"}
{"text":"Ted's is a Buffalo institution and Tempe is very lucky to have the only out of Western New York location.  Everything is good.  I have a friend who always orders burgers and he is happy as can be (though he orders doubles because the patties are old school small and adds hot sauce).  I always order dogs.  If you want to order like a pro you could do this... wait in line , when the person grilling makes eye contact with you speak clearly your order.  If you want my advice order this way... \"2 regular dogs and rings\", you will then be shuffled down the line.  When they ask you how you want your 2 regular dogs I suggest this.... One with hot sauce, onions, chili and cheese, and one with hot sauce, mustard, onions, and pickle.  That is the way I have done it since I was a little kid,  This place is 5 star."}
{"text":"With a line already at the door, one knows Ted's serves up some mighty yummy dogs. In addition, their \"white hots\" are fab, as well as their burgers. 
I'm not keen on their fries or onion rings, but that is just my personal taste...they are both fresh and the rings are home made.
The flavor of Ted's hotdogs are unmatched. 
Go!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a Buffalo NY style hot dog. I love this place and it is close to work. Fun atmosphere with old timey music playing inside. You will often see Spiro (now deceased) who is the descendant of the famous Ted in there talking with a bunch of typical regulars.

I usually get a couple of the All Beef Jumbo Dogs flown in from NY with whatever I want on them with a side of melted cheese and some pickle spears. The chili is pretty good also. You can pick from a large array of items to put on your wiener or burger. They cook it right in front of you while you wait. You can smell the tasty aroma of the mesquite charcoal in the parking lot before you enter. Onion rings made from scratch. They have footlongs, brats, polish, white hots (which I call bockwurst) and more. Some of them made here locally at one of my favorite sausage places in central Phoenix. They also have tasty hamburgers and chicken along with homemade ice cream shakes. 

Gets really busy with a long line during peak lunch hours. Get there before 11am or after 1pm. Poke me with a fork I'm done!"}
{"text":"Well..... I got chili and it was disgusting. It was full of grease. Like a 1/2 inch worth. How nasty. I am sitting here regretting eating it.. I need to work out now and have a glass of red wine. Ugh. The hot dog my man had was nothing great. Costco hot dogs are better and CHEAPER."}
{"text":"It's too good, I love being able to build my hot dog or burger exactly how I want it. Great fries. Great service. It's all killer. Sometimes the line can get long, but that's because it's good and they care about each customer. Get the cheese sauce, dip everything in it."}
{"text":"i can't believe it took me so long to finally try Ted's.

pretty straightforward hot dogs, i got a regular hot dog with a side of cheez (not CHEESE, because it was liquefied and nuclear orange) and a side of chili. i thought it was pretty good, the chili was a little oily, but fairly tasty.  the cheez could have come from circle k for all i know, it was REALLY thick though. like my spoon stood up in it thick.

the fries and onion rings are pretty darn tasty too. i didn't ask for ranch, i'm not sure if they have it. i'm going back, so i'll find out!

hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed.  I liked the charcoal grilled taste to the dog but I've had a much better dog than Ted's.  Nathan's for instance is a superior hotdog.  I really wanted to like this place but everything was just okay, not good, not great."}
{"text":"My husband and kids really liked this place. The hot dogs and chili cheese fries are great!"}
{"text":"Best foot long hot dogs in the world!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and people. Every time we go there we have a good experience. Try the hamburger you wont be disappointed. Doesn't look like much but it taste awesome!"}
{"text":"So happy they reopened from their renovation. My husband and I have been craving their chili cheese dog and corn dogs. The best part is none of their recipes have changed. They currently have some IKEA furniture until they get booths said a worker. Some of the finishing touches were done messy. As a designer I notice those small details. Over all the best hotdogs!"}
{"text":"I get the appeal of eating a good old American hot dog at a historical place, but besides that little bit of nostalgia I just wasn't impressed. I mean a hot dog can only be so good. 

Don't get me wrong, I would lie in front of a moving vehicle for a juicy tasty Chicago style hot dog. But just not from Teds... the whole experience was just mediocre and there is always a long wait."}
{"text":"I have always had an excellent lunch at Ted's - not necessarily the healthiest - but excellent!  It is easy to be intimidated in front of the lunch crowd when the cook is asking for your order across a line of hungry patrons - but it keeps the line rolling, and you get your food fast (without it quite being such fast food!).  All the dogs I've had there were excellent (never tried anything else - why would I - it's Ted's HOT DOGS!)."}
{"text":"This will remain a local mystery to me. A predictably long line, followed by very friendly customer service, followed by average or below average hot dog joint fodder. Onion rings are so greezy they are inedible. Just because it's the only hot dog game in town, does that mean you need to go? Nah."}
{"text":"True New York taste! They have crispy delicious french fries and thin crispy onion rings. The Salens hotdogs that they use are very high quality and truly delicious! Best hot dogs that I've ever had! Also the Teds brand hot sauce deserves a special mention, its very tasty tangy and has just the right amount of spiciness to it and it's very complimentary to all of their menu items... A++++++ Teds!"}
{"text":"Teds hotdogs made me achieve my first oral orgasm!  ....\"nothing could be fined than to be in Teds flaming pit right now\""}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I get the Polish and the Italian sausage. They use a wood fire super hot and cook these in a few minutes.  It is a treat. Not a fan of their fries but lots of people like them. Try it you will like it."}
{"text":"Sheesh. What is it with people here? It's a [bleep] hot dog. Just a hot dog. Yet, time and time again, there's a line wrapped around the building five times over. I don't care if the best [bleep] hot dog in all of North [bleep] America: I get claustrophobic any time I'm in there. Isn't it time Ted stepped up to the 21st Century? It's like the place is run with all the professionalism of a kid's lemonade stand. Yeah, I get that everything's grilled to order, but if you're that hard up to be waiting for literally fifteen to twenty minutes for some footlong and relish, there's something seriously wrong with you. A previous Yelper wrote that \"sometimes it's crowded\"? SOMETIMES? Gee... ya think?"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday 3 weeks ago to get hot dogs to go. I have come to expect a long slow line to order my food, usually 10 to 15 minutes, it irritates me , but I tolerate it.¬† On this day I waited¬† at least 35 minutes to order a couple hot dogs, that's not just poor service, that's complete total Disrespect by management toward their customers. As I got near front of line, I did see the manager poke his head out from the back of the restaurant , so I know the manager working that day. He didn't seem to concerned about the wait time, no sense of urgency. By the time¬† I got to the front of line I forgot to order the soda my wife wanted, because I was so completely pissed off about standing in line so long. I ordered a White Hot as usual, wife got a regular hot dog, the food was fine.¬† I understand they remodeled this place a couple years ago, what a wasted opportunity to re-design the ordering process. You know I can go to the Dutch Brothers over on Mill & Southern, It almost always has a line that snakes thru the parking lot.¬† Yet it only takes few minutes to get thru the line BECAUSE THERE IS SOMEONE WALKING CAR TO CAR TAKING ORDERS WITH A SMART PHONE DEVICE. You know Ted's, it wouldn't be that difficult have an employee with I-pad¬† taking orders, and maybe add a second toppings station, and another register to facilitate the ordering¬† process . A 35 - 40¬† minute wait, or even 10-15 minute wait , is to long of a wait to order a Hot dog, it speaks volumes about how little you care about your customers."}
{"text":"It's been about 4 or 5 years since i was last here. 
Every time I was in Phoenix area I would get lunch or dinner.
Stopped in a few nights ago and it was alittle sad.
The all beef hotdog was great but the regular hamburger was pretty disappointing. 
It was really tiny and thin. It barely got to the edge of the small bun. Thin a regular McDonalds hamburger. The difference is that Ted's was $3.00!!! Really disappointing. The split (1/2 fries 1/2 rings) were ok but the fries were not crisp.
Stick with the dogs or sausages you can find a much better burger in a lot of places.
Bummer."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and what better place than at a HOT DOG place to get food?  Anyway, for the price of my vegetarian processed tofu on a plain, grocery-store bun, I was expecting a bit more punch.  But what I got was something that I could've heated up in the microwave at home.  No flavor :-(  No punch."}
{"text":"This is a great staple of Tempe.  I try to stop by here before spring training and Diamondback games.  If you're looking for a grill dog I would say this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The wife and i make it a point to go to ted's dog at least once a month, more often if we didn't live so far away. Best hot dogs in the valley. Maybe it's the meat from Upstate New York or the mesquite charcoal they use or a combination of both but they are darn good. After they finish cooking them you can put pretty much put anything on them. Their fries and onion rings are also really good. The workers are friendly the place is clean and even though they may be busy, which is a lot the line goes quickly and you get your food fast. Just heard there are coming out to Gilbert in the fall. Guess we'll be eating there more often."}
{"text":"Had to give them some love, just eat here the other day, been there tons of times best dogs ever flame broiled you can burn em if you want... Chili and cheese are both great stuff. Only thing they always have a big line but that's tells you the place is a Tempe staple!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you're in the Tempe area and have a craving for a good hot dog. Make sure you're not in a rush when you come here because you do have a bit of a wait after placing your order but it's worth it. The grilled taste of the wiener sets this apart from hot dogs from other places. I also liked the onion rings a lot; they were very lightly battered and an order is quite generous - enough for two people.  Lots of seating, indoor and outdoor, and a very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time trying teds. Only issue is no prices and no combos. So got burger with cheese which was really good. Will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.

Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.

I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!

I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!

Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection."}
{"text":"I have been in Arizona for 8 years and have driven past many times. My girlfriend and I were driving on the 4th of July after watching some fireworks and she was craving a hot dog other then mine. The funny thing was we were stopped at a light and Ted's was right there so it was just fate. We went in and the place is a bit older but clean. We ordered a foot long chili dog and split, was a great eat and would recommend the place to anyone. If your girl wants a weiner other then yours then bring her there and watch her put that juicy piece of meat in her mouth, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in the Valley! They charbroil your dog right in front of you, offer a variety of fresh condiments, and consistently have good crispy fries."}
{"text":"I really hope the seating is temporary. The chairs are uncomfortable. Very hot air when you wait in line. Seems like there is air in dining area. Friendly staff. I wasn't blown away....but it could be my but was numb from being squeazed in that folding chair. Really?"}
{"text":"Love this place.

When I get that craving for a good charcoal grilled dog or burger I come straight here. Just can't resist at times. 

Plenty of hot dog choices
Wide variety of topping options
Fries and onion rings are made fresh with your order. 

Don't think; just go."}
{"text":"After passing by this location so many times I finally decided to give this hot dog place a try. So I tried the regular hot dog, cheese fries, and vanilla shake for my first time. The hot dog was just okay but felt that I could have made a better choice by picking something else. Cheese fries were decent and I did like how the cheese came in a separate container cup. The vanilla shake was one of the best shakes that I've had and I have gone through plenty of milkshakes over the years in my travels. I will definitely be coming back to get that again.

There's not too much of an atmosphere here as there is more emphasis on them serving customers and it can hard to find an available table when it's busy. However this seems like a great spot for take-out as the food is prepared rather quickly. This restaurant has been here for many years and it's easy to see why it has been around for so long."}
{"text":"In Short: Long lines, complicated menu, and a fist full of dollars ........ for a hot dog?

I guess I never bought into the whole gourmet hot dog fad, and probably never will.  I've heard my coworkers talk about the dogs, and on more than one occasion seen astronomical lines at the counter, so I thought why not, it had to be good, right?

Talk about sticker shock, and only for a single dog?  Very overpriced indeed, on top of that, they managed to complicate a simple hot dog.  Various types of meats and topping options were a bit confusing, not because there were too many choices, but because non of them were really explained.  A little annoying for a first timer customer.  The dogs themselves are not bad, but I think you'd have to a complete idiot to mess up a hot dog.  I still don't get whats so amazing about it, definitely way too overpriced, won't go again.  They can keep their wieners and shove it!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating those Seitz hot dogs that came in the silver package and on sale you could get 4 packs for a dollar or something like that.  They were awful, and I'm pretty sure if I get any chronic or terminal illnesses, it's going to be from eating about a thousand of those.

Then I lived in Orlando for a few years and became a regular at Hot Dog Heaven.  Now THIS is a hot dog!  Then I started paying more attention.

Well, on Saturday Mr. M and I were on a hot dog cruise and stood in the very long line at Ted's to order 2 jumbos with cheese & mustard, mine also with relish, a bottle of water, and a chocolate shake.  The total was $15.55 and reminded me that I really need to remember to carry our own water with us.  That would have saved 2 bucks. 

Anyway, HEY, back to the dogs....chargrilled and perfect!  I was taken back to Hot Dog Heaven and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The milkshake was rich, chocolatey deliciousness too.  I will definitely get a craving for Ted's and can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous when I saw the line but I figured if there were that many people waiting it must be worth it.  Luckily the line moved quickly.  The hot dog was pretty good but the Italian sausage was one of the best I've ever had.  The fries were just so-so.  The Italian sausage will probably bring me back a few more times."}
{"text":"Being a Seattle-native, I'd never even heard of Ted's until two Tempe natives mentioned this hot dog hot spot.

All of our food was prepared fast and it was quite delicious. Even though they're famous for their hot dogs, I opted for the corn dog (which was amazing). Personally, I think the best thing at Ted';s is their onion rings. I don't even like onions, but I ran across McClinktock Drive to get Ted's rings to bring back to another dining establishment.

Happy Hot Dog Adventures to you all!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The onion rings and dogs are great. The ordering process is maddening. Especially if it is busy. Is it worth it? Yes. Will it feel worth it until you are at your table with your food? No."}
{"text":"Ted's has been around forever for two reasons. Great quality and fair price.

I coworker had posted photos earlier this year, spending hours in line to take her daughter to Pink's Hot Dogs in LA. I asked why wait in an insanely long line for Pink's, when she can get better product at Ted's. She'd never heard of Ted's, so I made it a mission to take her for lunch.
It was a super hungry day for me - I had an Italian Sausage with a side of a regular dog. The coworker had a jumbo dog, and we shared onion rings.
The onion rings were amazing. All onion rings should be Ted's onion rings! Thin sliced, crispy breading - clearly made fresh to order. 
My Italian Sausage was perfectly seasoned and had just the right level of spice. Topped with deli mustard and cooked peppers and onions. I could not have asked for a more delicious lunch.
In hindsight, I should have eaten the regular dog first. It was tasty. Incredibly enjoyable. But with the flavor of the Italian Sausage still on my tongue, it was a little on the boring side. Truly, nothing wrong with it at all - and had I reversed the order of consumption, I would have loved both equally. My fault, not Ted's!
If I had to come up with a con, it would be the location. Nowhere close to my house or stomping grounds, and too far from my office to make it a regular stop. Tempe people are soooo lucky!"}
{"text":"If you want a GREAT hotdog, look no further!  I've been going to Ted's since I was a little kid.  I love their all-beef hotdogs and french fries dipped in cheese!  So good!  Sometimes the line gets long but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Updated 9/13/17... 
Changed from 4 stars to three. Double cheese burger has thin patties; meat is ok. Water is not filtered... you do the math on that one. We just couldn't drink it or the ice cubes. Only one size on shakes. On the upside, they have remodeled since we were last hear. Great job on spiffing the place up.

Previous review:

Fabulous New York style hot dogs, brats, sausages, burgers, chicken sandwiches. They grill it right there in front of you and add all kinds of toppings. French fries rock.

4 stars because onion rings are incredibly greasy and comes in a big bag of gnarley pieces. Also, you can't fill your own soda or water or put on your own mustard and stuff. The young people running the counter aren't the most professional. Maybe that's kind of closer to how they would do it in NYC. 

Shakes are yummy - choices are chocolate, vanilla or strawberry. This beats Portillo's hot dogs down the street any day. Yea for Ted's!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love these hot dogs! This place doesn't need a long review. GO THERE AND EAT A DOG."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Literally drove 30 minutes cause I heard great reviews & came for customer appreciation day. 91 cents a hot dog. The hot dogs taste like backyard grilled hot dogs, you literally can make them yourself. They also burnt some of the hot dogs.

The fries are okay.

In my opinion Costco has a better deal & they taste better."}
{"text":"Extremely frustrating to wait in like for 15-20 minutes only to have my order completely wrong. I ordered a veggie dog, which I've had before and IS vegetarian. All of the wait (really unnecessary there were 4-5 people working the grill and 2 people in line in front of me) just to come home and have a real hot dog that I'm unable to eat (I'm a vegetarian.) 

Not going to be coming back to Ted's."}
{"text":"Teds is awesome. The best onion rings ever.  There hot dogs are great and the service is so fast."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but when I want a hot dog, this is where I get a hot dog.  The all beef hot dog is to die for.  

It won't fill you up, unless you spend over $10, but it is a good, satisfying meal.  The toppings are great--they have everything.  Ketchup, mustard, deli mustard, relish, spicy relish, chopped onions, peppers and onions, tomatoes, sauerkraut.... Did I forget any?  Fries are good, and the onion rings are alright (although they are closer to an onion brick).  

Also, they do accept credit cards now."}
{"text":"I'm a Buffalo, NY native and the past two years we've come out to see the Buffalo Sabres play the Coyotes, we've stopped here. Bottom line, if you want a Hamburger you go to a place that specializes in hamburgers, if you want a hot dog, same story, Ted's is where it's at!  I cannot stand when hot dogs roll around a flat top in grease, or sit in hot water, charcoal is the way to go. Makes the skin super crispy and gives it the snap everyone should be looking for in a hot dog. I always get mine with ketchup, mustard, onions, and dill pickle. Skinny fries with malt vinegar and a side of cheese. If you haven't tried their loganberry, do it. Some say it tastes like flat Dr. Pepper, myself, I feel it's a cross between concord grape juice and fruit punch. Delicious!  I wish they would open one in Las Vegas, but until then, we'll keep visiting every time we're in town."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about ten years and haven't been in at least a year. We visited today and I was completely floored with the amazing new remodel and same quality food. They have done amazing with the place and the food is better than ever. I was excited to hear about upcoming changes to the Tempe location patio and a new location opening on Gilbert road and Germann in the fall. I love the food, the people, and now the stellar atmosphere. My daughter was just as excited about her food and the new kids club they implemented. She loved the hat, sticker, and punch card for one free meal after five kids meals. What an amazing business all around! Major thumbs up for all the improvements."}
{"text":"Fine, fine, fine. Just get it out of your system now. Yell at me and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about....Sorry but I just can't rave about this place. Yes, its crowded but the line moves; yes, they yell across the room for your order and yes its cooked open fire style. You can throw any number of things on top. I'm still sorry but unless I am sitting at Yankee Stadium with a Nathan's hot dog on a perfect June day - which is all about the experience and the location - its still just a hot dog. 

Its fine. Just fine. Its a hot dog. With or without stuff."}
{"text":"I wish you were able to give half stars because this would be a 3.5 for sure.  It's nice that everything is made fresh to order.  The only downside of this is that it takes a little longer.  They also use the same utensils for the toppings (lettuce, onion, pickle, etc.) instead of one for each which I thought was a little strange.  It's definitely just personal preference but I don't like that.  

Prices are definitely reasonable for what you get.  My husband got a regular cheeseburger and a chili cheese dog, I got a bacon cheeseburger, my son got a kids meal, and we got onion rings to share.  My husband said the hot dog was perfectly grilled and juicy.  My son (who is very picky) also liked his and the amount of fries you get for the kids meal is massive.  My bacon was a tad overdone but my burger was PERFECT.  Love the taste of a nicely grilled burger like that.  The onion rings are thrown in  bag in bits so they aren't much to look at, but the taste is to die for.  

We ate inside and it was very clean.  I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Had the All Beef.  It was a really tasty hot dog.  To comment further would be ridiculous."}
{"text":"Hot Dogs are good but way over priced for a hot dog in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow. I first ate at Ted's about 7 years ago and absolutely hated it, but I drove by this evening, thought about all of those positive reviews on Yelp, and decided to step inside. It was pretty damn good.

One thing though, if they're going to serve quality hot dogs and bratwursts, they should really offer something better than that yellow French's mustard to put on it. You don't drink a screw-cap wine when you have a good meal, and you shouldn't put that kiddie mustard on a good brat. This place will be strictly 'to go' orders for me, and I'll use the good German mustard in my fridge."}
{"text":"I'd been told by a couple of people that Ted's was the place in town for dogs.

Gotta say, compared to Portillos and Short Leash, I'm a Ted's man (with Portillos coming in second).

Got the white hot - loaded - fantastic!  
Split and onion ring order with my wife (should've brought the kids - huge order!)
Got a strawberry shake - the kid who made it said it would be the best shake I'd had - and he was pretty darned close to correct.  It was really really good!

If you haven't been to Ted's, get in the car and go.  Now.  Why are you still reading this?"}
{"text":"Most fantastic dogs around. Always a long line though so plan to take your time. Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a classic dog place with consistently reliable and tasty food. If you are from out of town or looking for something different then every other place you eat make sure you visit Ted's! I have been going here for years and I never get tired of the food or experience."}
{"text":"Another classic from Buffalo NY! This is yet another reason to visit Buffalo, the food is incredible and the best part: NO CHAIN RESTAURANTS!"}
{"text":"I read great reviews about this place and wanted to try it out for myself. I ordered the all beef hot dog and fries and was hoping for the best. Somehow the ketchup, mustard, pickle relish and tomato I asked for didn't get thru to the lady taking my order as my hot dog only had a million sliced tomatoes, ketchup and a pickle. Now don't get me wrong, the actual beef hot dog was AMAZING!! I love that it's char-grilled. It reminds me of a summer bbq, but the fries were terrible and because my hot dog order was slightly messed up I can't give this place high reviews. I'll stick to Lobby's for their delicious fries and CHICAGO STYLE hot dogs (which I love)... but if I'm in the mood for something char-grilled I'll definitely come to Teds again... though I'll watch them make my hot dog step by step so they don't mess it up."}
{"text":"Teds is the place for Dogs!
Love coming here at anytime of the day or night! Quick speedy service, and the Dogs are to die for!!! Priced just right for that quick pick me up as you head across town!
Service is always great!"}
{"text":"What do you call a hot dog race?... Wiener takes all!

And so does Ted's Red Hots!  You really can't argue with their history.  They have been making hot dogs and sausages since the 20's in Buffalo, NY.  By some grace of god the made their way to Arizona and the rest is history.  This place must be on your AZ Favorite Food place.

Depending  upon what time you arrive you may have to endure standing in line in front of their grill where you will have to smell all the smells and simply salivate until you get your own.

No matter your meat choice, you will not be disappointed.  

PRO TIP:  Ask for a toasted bun, and you must try the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"When it comes to fine hotdoggary, look no further.  UNIX has the philosophy of: \"Do One Thing and Do It Well.\"  I guarantee you they stole that from Ted's as Ted's has been doing that since 1927, and UNIX only since '69.  They charcoal broil their dogs, which gives them an awesome flavour.  I have never been disappointed by a trip to Ted's, and I bet you won't be either.  They have plenty of parking, lots of seating, and several options and variations for you.  I brought my little nephew when they visited from out of town...he loved a place devoted to the hot dog."}
{"text":"Our first visit here, we came because of the great reviews and weren't disappointed. They have great music, throwback atmosphere was enjoyable and service was prompt and friendly. 

The burger was definitely better than your typical burger. It had a soft bun, and it was served nice and hot. You watch them make your burger and choose toppings as you go. The horseradish mustard was a definite plus!   Toppings were fresh. Bacon was cooked perfectly. 

Fries were good-shoe string style. Onion ring style isn't what we prefer but many enjoy the crumbly coating type - we prefer beer battered. 

Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good hot dog for when you're craving one. They have tons of toppings, too, including mac & cheese and bacon. Good shakes, too."}
{"text":"Ted's is a Phoenix original by way of Buffalo and has probably fed tens of thousands ASU students and teachers over the years.

Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special. 

But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.  

One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.

But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.  

They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.

Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off, sorry friendly staff and I loved the old school vibe and decor complete with 1950's music. My family tried just about everything on the menu, I'd say In N Out burgers are better (and half the price) but Ted's had way better fries. The highlight for me were the milkshakes made with hard ice cream instead of soft, I had a loganberry shake and it was delicious. They also have gluten free buns and veggies dogs which my daughters said were great."}
{"text":"This place rocks! You will not regret coming here if you're a first timer. I love their corn dogs and chili cheese dogs with a jumbo hotdog which is all beef. Their coke products are on point too! Their lines can be long but it's because everyone knows how good this place is!"}
{"text":"Ted's is the Bomb Susan! Find me a better corn dog or chili cheese dog in Arizona. The only place I've had a better corn dog is at Disneyland(That's right Disneyland Susans) Ted's has really good cheese and cheese fries. This place is serious!"}
{"text":"This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink."}
{"text":"Five stars for the awesome dogs. I get the jumbo with mustard and onions and always enjoy it. Good hot dogs are hard to find. The fries are good and onion rings are on my bucket list the next time I am there with a friend to share the big order with. 

Deducting one star for the service. Sad to say but the girl who dressed my dog was obviously angry that she had to take over someone else's position on the line and she made no attempt to hide it. She gave the other worker a really nasty look and rolled her eyes at another employee. She slammed the buns down on the counter and was downright short tempered with all the customers. It was very unprofessional. She needs to learn to curb her emotions when serving the public.

UPDATE: Tried the onion rings today - they are great except for one thing - they should be sliced thicker. They are battered, not breaded, the way rings should be. Huge order."}
{"text":"great dogs, you name the fixins , good onion rings."}
{"text":"Gross highly expensive glob of fried onions.  Supposed to be onion rings.  Almost  $5 for this greasy mess."}
{"text":"I tried this place EVERYONE talks about..here in AZ... you hear \"best toppings\" the \"Flavor\" the \"NY imported Hotdogs\"...Puh-leez. I thought it was OK. That is all. 

I say you save ur money and go get a SONORAN HOT Dog  and then tell me about Flavor, Toppings and who needs imported hotdogs when you can make a normal hotdog a mexican deliciousness??? Shoot I'll make you a bomb Hotdog Myself!

Ayyy dios m√≠o...Not impressed."}
{"text":"Ted's has been a part of the fabric of Tempe for as long as I can remember. It has been the go to place for delicious hot dogs, fresh onion rings and hand made shakes. They also make great chicken sandwiches, burgers and even salads. Their hardwood charcoal grill makes everything smell and taste fantastic. They have a Chipotle-style ordering process so you can see things being cooked and assembled as you go down the line. The atmosphere is very chill, prices are fair and they have plenty of seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"Yum.

Haven't been here in, like, 20 years, but I can promise it won't take that long to go back. The dogs were perfect. I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but when I want one, I want one grilled and slightly charred. That's what I got.

The fries and onion strings were SO good. Hot and crispy and full of flavor. Not a lot of fancy anything, just your classic hot dog toppings, simple fries and onion rings (when you do it right you don't need to cover it up).

They also have burgers and shakes. Must try next time."}
{"text":"Other than their long lines (but we always go on Monday after a holiday, when everyone is off, so can't complain) their hot dogs are good. Definitely recommend. Wish they had a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs and onion rings here. I'm not a huge fan of their regular dogs, but the all beef dogs are great. I get the chili cheese dogs and sauerkraut dogs, which definitely hit the spot. Prices aren't fantastic, the waiting line can get annoying if you are hungry, and there is nowhere to refill your drink...which are the cons. If you don't care about any of that, and just want some good hot dogs, then this is a great place."}
{"text":"Ted's offered me a wonderously greasy medley in my stomach that was tasty until the very last bite. 

Charred franks are my favorite way to enjoy them and Ted's didn't disappoint there. I ended up getting an all beef, a Polish and some onion rings (I had no idea how big an order of rings was). The links were grilled to near perfection and were quite juicy. As for the onion rings, they were greasy and sloppy and pretty much what most people would expect them to be. There is one downside though and that would be the lack of condiments. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch but I was hoping for a lot more; there weren't even any grilled onions from what I saw. I had planned on getting my Polish Maxwell style, but alas, I could not. 

There are two final things I would have to say. First, the food and the prices were great, and the sausages were very good. And second, I can strongly recommend this place but if Lobby's right down the road decided to do some charred dogs, I think business could be booming. Check out both places!"}
{"text":"Then very best hot dogs ever!! French fries and onion rings are incredible.  Quite th e bang for your buck. Love this place"}
{"text":"Choice of dogs.  Hot dogs have the skin casing which I love.  Onion rings were great.  Quick, Cheap (two dogs for under 6 bucks out the door)  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Fast, yummy, fair priced lunch."}
{"text":"Love everything about Ted's, except for the lines but they really need to start giving peeps FREE REFILLS on their drinks! Enough said."}
{"text":"They really need to get more help! Only 4 people to work the line on a Sunday afternoon?!?  Waited almost 45 minutes before we even got to order. Where is the management?? I felt bad for the poor people who were working. They hustled but the quality was missing.  My regular wasn't as charred as normal. Great corn dog though."}
{"text":"OK, first things first.  To whoever even MENTIONED Pink's hotdogs in the same breath as Ted's, you are certifiably insane or you've never actually been to Pink's.  This is NOTHING like Pink's.  Pink's is like the Disneyland of hotdogs and has a wide selection of creative dogs that are worth standing in line for.  Ted's has a good solid hotdog, but definitely not worth any significant wait (which, fortunately, there was none when we went)  Mostly the options are: regular, footlong and all-beef.  Toppings were chili, cheese, ketchup, mustard (spicy and regular), onions, pickles and onions/peppers.They also have sausages (Italian, bratwurst, and others), but they weren't worth mentioning.  Definitely just get one of the hotdogs.  The buns were fresh, the onion rings are good (they're the thinly sliced, non-stiff kind) and my vanilla shake was pretty good.  But DEFINITELY not Pink's or anything amazing.  I thought Abu's review below was pretty harsh, but I hate to admit it, but he's closer to the mark than the 5 stars on here."}
{"text":"would be 5 stars but am limited on when I can go as the lines are always out the door, and sadly I am handicapped and standing in the line I can not do as they have no seating while waiting :( . 
The fact though that there is always a line there speaks volumes of how good their food is. I am not a big Hotdog fan myself but their  Hamburgers are excellent cooked over a mesquite wood grill YUM. If there is no line I will stop and grab a Onion Ring they are soooo good its a rare treat because as I said so busy normally, Just had some last week as I went by right as they opened and pulled in so fast I left rubber on the street. 
If you are looking for great Hotdogs, Hamburgers, Fries (get them with cheese) and Onion rings this is the place to stop long wait but so worth it.
If you are handicapped and can not stand to long go when they open it is worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know how I've missed out on this place for so long. Friends of mine have been going for years, and I don't eat hot dogs usually, but decided I would go and try their veggie dogs, which are measly in size to the real hot dogs, but whatever, I got two veggie dogs fully loaded polish style, and they were so. good. 

Also, their onion rings make me so happy. Not overly greasy, just plain good. Get yourself a lingonberry shake! It tastes like the best strawberry shake you've never made."}
{"text":"Veggie dogs (and also veggie burgers) tend to heavily depend of their toppings to be impressive, but once in a while you get one that is just right, with or without the toppings. 
Ted's hot dogs has a really great veggie dog, and all the topping choices make for a truly good veggie dog.

As a vegetarian, I clearly can't say much for their regular meat hot dogs, but I always get 1 or 2 of them served plain and without a bun for my dog (once in a while I let her get one with cheese)... and she loves them! I have people say my dog has a more advanced palette than they do, so I really do mean it as a compliment! 

My dog and I like your stuff, and Postmates delivers, so we will keep on ordering."}
{"text":"The place has a lot a variety in hot dogs, so if you wanna try something different than the usual meat and bun, it's a good place to start. If you are already pretty clever with grilling up you own, I think you may be a little disappointed. If you already buy good quality hotdogs, from the store, then the taste won't WOW you."}
{"text":"They have the best onion rings. I don't even like onion rings but I always order Ted's onion rings."}
{"text":"Great Onion rings too.

Yes, there si ALWAYS a line, but its hard to find a line that moves faster than Ted's.   They have it down to a science.  

Don't be afraid to try the white hot dogs.   An upstate NY favorite and not to be missed."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for quite some time. In fact, I used to work down the street a long time ago, and this is where I would lunch.

I had never been disappointed enough to review this place until recently. 

We had stopped coming for a very long time since Hotdogs aren't normally in our dietary preference. However, we were seriously enwrapped in Pokemon Go, and they had a Pokemon Gym in these premises. 

What a great way to enjoy a Hot Dog, and play our favorite game. We went on two consecutive occasions. Both were on a Sunday evening. Busy, but not too busy.

The first time around, the Hot Dog guy was efficient. The Onion Ring guy had a 'tude, and the cashier seemed like every customer was just a bother to her.

We both had the Hot Dogs. Mine was plain, and my wife's was the Chili Dog. We had our normal drinks, and I had a Strawberry Shake.

The Hot Dogs were just \"meh\" (in comparison to say, Short Leash), but everything else was okay. Nothing to write home about, and we even ignored the front desk help. We were too excited and engrossed in our Gym battles that we didn't pay much attention.

However, the next Sunday we went there. We got an even worse reception. The Hot Dog guy was on par again, but the cashier (it was a different girl, this time) was just too rude and impolite. And she forgot my wife's drink, and she threw an attitude when my wife asked for it, as if she was really being put out. I went up there and said something as I picked up the food, vowing to never to return to this establishment.

However, they left me a parting gift because the next morning, I basically heaved the Hot Dog that I ate, and everything else that came with it. I was literally sick all day, and had stomach issues for several days. And I have eaten foods in so many countries, that I don't normally react this way to bad food. Not sure if it was the Hot Dog, the Onion Rings, or the Milk Shake, but something from this place didn't agree with me to a great degree!

Hence, this will be our last visit to this Tempe icon. It has definitely fallen off our dining pedestal, and has fractured a leg!"}
{"text":"Love Teds hotdogs! Love that you get to watch them make everything there on the grill in front of you. I usually always get the all beef hotdog and they let you pick what toppings you want at the end. The onion rings are great!"}
{"text":"Great hotdog and good service.  Lots of condiments to choose.  It's a good place to get a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Thank god for Ted's Hot Dogs!  There is nothing better in life than a charbroiled hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  My cohorts at work turned me onto Ted's and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes, I'm that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me, \"I wish we could have a great hot dog today.\"  I broke down and wept, confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Ted's to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She, loving me, immediately hit me a couple of times about the head, and said \"Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you.\"  Now, if you ever meet Marie, you'll come to know that she is sweet and understanding, but on that day, I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say, we had a great experience at Ted's that Sunday.

REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards, no credit cards, no bartering."}
{"text":"Ted's is legendary in the Tempe; and thankfully less than 2 miles from the Burger Guys house. And only another 2 miles from my favorite burger in the Valley, Detroit Coney Grill. I will say this... Ted's probably has the best hotdog in town. Try a jumbo all beef with bacon and mac and cheese on top! Ok enough of the hotdog talk, this is a Burger Guy review...

The Burger - 8.5 (out of 10)
Ted's makes a damn fine basic burger. When I think of a good ol' fashion classic burger, I think of the burger at Ted's. Ted's uses a charbroiler and they cook the meat right there in front of you while you wait in line. Great flavor on the loose packed thin beef patty (almost definitely chuck). Great bun to meat to cheese to veggie ratio. The Burger Guy gets the double cheese with bacon. Side note: the french fries are good here, as well as basically everything else on the menu. I don't know what's going on with Tempe but there are some awesome burger places in this town. 

Note: Score is for the burger only. Other factors such as service, price, and ambience are not considered.

{"text":"This place is an institution. I have been going here since I was a kid after Sun Devil or Suns games waaaay back in the 80's.  It's a comfort to see an establishment like this still exist, maintain reasonable prices and still deliver a quality product. Really, the hot dogs and burgers here are amazing and they make them right in front of you. Don't be shy - tell them how you want them cooked!  

This is your grill and it has been for decades. AMAZING"}
{"text":"There's something about Ted's that makes it a winner. It's amazing that they have most of their locations in NY state and one in Tempe in Arizona, but I am glad that they do.

Grilled hot dogs, indoors, while you watch the guy cook them. There is a certain uniformity and process to it, but it also feels like a couple guys at a hot dog stand in front of a ballpark. I definitely recommend the cheese fries, they're a fantastic compliment to a hot dog.

With so many great hot dog choices in Tempe (Portillo's/Detroit Coney grill are two other solid options) Ted's definitely has their own niche. Always enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"There was a long line, so I was anticipating a good dog. What I got was a mediocre dog, very greasy onion rings that were nearly tasteless.
Not worth the cost or time."}
{"text":"AAAAMAZING.
They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs.
They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted's..... definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"A hot dog, is a hot dog. Unless it's Ted's. 

Seriously there is black magic going on here. Apparently they start by getting a super high quality dog made for them back in Buffalo, then they beat the heck out of it above open flame! Seriously they poke and slice the dog up while it's being grilled over white oak charcoal and it picks up all that smokey goodness while cooking. 

There are two other shining stars at Teds. Their house hot sauce and the Loganberry drink. The loganberry is basically glorified koolaid, but man is it good. The hot sauce is more of a relish and is unlike any other I have had. I'm not really sure what's going on in it, but it's just a little spicy, sweet and awesome.

Their cheese is straight up east coast style cheese sauce. Basically cheese wiz. If you like that sort of thing go for it. The chili is that midwest no beans kind. Not my thing, but that's fine. I always get the jumbo all beef topped with mustard, relish, onions and the hot sauce. 

Everything not fried is cooked over that same white oak charcoal, so it all picks up that goodness. That means if you're not feeling a hotdog, everything else is going to be sold, but keep in mind \"Hot Dog\" is in the name of the place. Don't expect for their burger to change your world.

Last time I checked their were 8 locations. 7 in Buffalo, NY and this one."}
{"text":"This place was terrible from the second I walked in. I was so excited to get a good hotdog and onion rings since I heard that they were both excellent. First of all, the staff was the worst staff I've ever came encountered with. When my friend asked what to get, because we had never been there before, all the staff literally said I dont know. Nice way to upsell guys. Then the girl cashing us out coul dnt ring up our order right. I think she was new. The tables were small and sucked. All the tables weren't wiped down or clean. Now the food. The onion rings were TERRIBLE. basically no breading, stringy, tasteless. Mac and cheese tasted and looked old. Was terrible even when I added extra cheese sauce that I had to pay for. The chili dog I got was ok. Not very flavorful. Overall, I won't ever come back and should have just asked for my money back because I totally regret spending 20 bucks on 2 hot dogs, a sise of Mac and cheese, an onion ring and one drink. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"Great hot dog place. It is almost always packed, which is a good thing. I love their unique charcoal cooking method that they stoke right in front of you. It's affordable and excellent taste, includes all the fixins you'd want. It's hard to find a good dog place. Sometimes you have to settle for the Shcnitz if you aren't close Ted's. Love it!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 7/10/2016:  While the food remains good, something has happened to the service. I have been going to this location for over 20 years and the line never moved as slowly as it did today. There were very few people in line when I walked in but it was quite a while before anyone asked for my order. Both the people in front of me and behind me in line commented they had also never seen the line move so slowly, and they were also long-time customers.

I tried to figure it out since I counted five staff members on the line; one on the grill, one handling drinks and shakes (which left her just standing there most of the time), one putting the condiments on the orders, one at the register, and one handling the fries and onion rings. The only thing I could think of was the staff was new. One person looked vaguely familiar but other than that I didn't recognize anyone, and another person said \"I've never seen these people before.\" The employees weren't horsing around; everything just moved very, very slowly.

Because I drove in from so far away I hung in there until I got my order, but if I lived closer I would have been long gone.  I don't like downgrading my initial positive review but I think management needs to be aware they have a customer service issue--at least they had one today around 6:00-7:00 p.m.

......................................................................
Ted's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.

11/8/09: Found myself at Ted's again today [along with a few other times since posting this review].  Same great dogs, and this time got the fries and onion rings--so good. Same quick service too. So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!

01/07/2014 - Ted's still delivers the goods. Since I live in San Tan Valley now (we formerly borrowed Queen Creek's name) I don't get out there often, though have been there a few times since the last update). Today I ordered the jumbo all beef, fries and onion rings, as always--and as always, it was delicious. Thanks Ted's!"}
{"text":"OH GOD, oh god do I miss this place ;)
The burnt crackling skin falling off my dog, the crispy yum of the onion rings....now I know WHY i gained them 45 lbs when I lived here.

But oh how great it was.....I miss you Ted, I truly do!"}
{"text":"Whole beef dog with everything...crusty, juicy, loaded, wow! The hot sauce here is just fiery enough to kick up the volume on that unbeatable dog. Would that I could've eaten four or five and still kept my girlish figure..."}
{"text":"It doesn't take long to realize that there are a lot of Midwest transplants living in the valley. It's evident in all the Chicago based restaurants that have a presence to the Cubs fan base at spring training games... But who knew western New York was represented in the mix?

Buffalo to be specific. I don't know as much about the New York - Phoenix connection. But it's both quirky and cool to think that the only Ted's Hot Dogs outside of the state of New York, is in Tempe.

After hearing the ads on the radio forever, I finally visited Ted's for the first time about a year ago. Since then, I've also introduced my sons. And tonight, I was feeling like a kid with a craving for a good ole messy chili dog. As always, I wasn't disappointed.

I have previously enjoyed a variety of their hot dogs and the burger I tried was delicious too. I wanted something different so I chose a jumbo chili and cheese dog. The hot dogs are cooked over charcoal. 'Nuff said. I added chopped onion, mustard and extra chili. The cheese is a cheddar cheese sauce. Perfect for this messy kind of affair!

As always, I chose the excellent hand made onion rings. This side is best shared. They are cut thin and the portion is generous. Trust me, if you like onion rings, you won't be disappointed. Or feel like you got ripped off cause there was five rings in the bag. Finally, I chose the orange cream milkshake for my beverage/dessert. I don't think I've ever tried an orange shake before. It was delicious and refreshing.

Thankfully, Ted's isn't all about hot dogs. There is enough variety to bring me back. Next time, I'll be enjoying either the triple cheeseburger I saw being promoted, or a foot long, or one of their white hots. Thanks Ted's! Now I have to start acting my age again..."}
{"text":"Had the Italian dog with bacon, strawberry shake and split (1/2 fries and onion rings). The dog was delicious and the bacon added just the perfect taste. 

The shake was watery and not much taste, although it was easy to drink through a straw.

Loved the idea if the split but onion rings were soggy. Stick with th he frys.

Make sure have time to wait if there is a line.

Overall for $14 I would say yes to the dog for sure and get some water."}
{"text":"We were going to eat at Beavers Choice but they were closed today. We decided to try Ted's Hot Dogs since so many people everywhere including the workplace rave about this place. Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.

THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING 

I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem. 

The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle.
Also

The onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion. 


I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!"}
{"text":"Their claim to fame is charcoaled grilled hot dogs and burders, taken back to my days of youth when Dad would spend time at the grill.  They were great and it was even fun ordering and decorating my food.  The onion rings are fresh made and they give you a ton with your order.  The chili sauce was so so, everything else was great and it was a fun trip."}
{"text":"Geat food and fast service.  My son loves the shakes and we all love the food.  Great place to go before an ASU game."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I had a cheeseburger and it was fantastic. The employees however, seem fresh out of high school or still in high school and don't seem to really care. But it's whatever. The double cheeseburger is actually worth dealing with that. Just wish they had combo meals."}
{"text":"Great food, fries are much better than the onion rings. Hot dogs were delicious and tasty. Ranch were 3 for $1 so that was a good deal. Friendly staff and thankfully his time there wasn't a line so we ordered and had our food within 10 minutes"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ted's for 10 years. It's the best grilled hotdog place in the Valley. The lines are always long, but they get you out surprisingly quickly. You can watch the grill person as the cooking is done. I love it! The buns are fresh, the dogs snap at you as you bite into them......heaven."}
{"text":"Ridiculously large portions of fries, awesome chocolate shake, hot dog had unimpressive liquid cheese, burger was okay, total bill $11.64 and we had food in under 10 minutes. Thumbs up, beats all the fast food chains."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a good hot dog then Ted's is a great choice.  It is cheap and friendly.  They also have a  great chicken sandwich and the french fries and onion rings are home made and to die for. So good. The only downside to this place is that ordering  can be a bit messy.  The cook hollars at you while you are still far back in the line and you have to yell your order at him and sometimes its crowded and hard to find a place to sit.  If you don't go at lunch rush though, its great."}
{"text":"I like this place because the food is cooked right in front of you, but I wasn't blown away by the flavors. My hot dog was pretty good and reminded me of days out at the baseball field. Unfortunately, I didn't feel well after eating here, so it's hard to give a good review."}
{"text":"Omg , I took a bite of a sausage sandwich  and I had to spit it out ... Almost puked in my mouth it tasted gross . Never again ...."}
{"text":"Teds is just one of those spots that you love because it's simplicity. A hot dog and fries even without all the toppings is so delicious! Although my daughter and I prefer to get their yummy cheese sauce... We don't come here often but when we do it's always great. Don't be intimidated by the long line, especially during lunch, it moves quickly. My husband likes to get a root beer float which I'll admit I've stole some sips and it was good."}
{"text":"Wow, it's been years since I have been here. Decided to go all out and get a chili cheese dog and cheese fries. I had forgotten about how delicious these dogs are!"}
{"text":"I wish this place wasn't so busy!  It is always packed!  If I didn't have to worry about things like cholesterol, or trans fat, I would eat here more often.  Great hot dogs, on a real grill with real hand dipped onion rings."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I lived in AZ....the brats were amazing and even the burgers and curly fries were good.  Not too healthy, but then again, you don't think about that kind of stuff when you go to a hot dog restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in (for the first time) to curb a craving for a chili dog. 

This place is stuck in a time warp but that adds to it's charm as well as it's \"flavor\". You waiting line in front of the grill and tell them what you want off of their simple, easy menu. 
I ordered an all beef with chili and cheese and right before my eyes, I see him pull a fresh dog out and start to cook it over the hot coals. Pretty cool, I must say. 

One thing I have to give a shout out about, HOW CLEAN THE GRILL HOODS WERE!!! For being over open coals and with the volume of business they do (was busy when we were there), those hoods were sparkling CLEAN!! To keep hoods clean in any restaurant, you clean them like bi weekly... these things look like they are polished daily!!! great job!! 

Back to the dogs- The chili and cheese are added right in front of you, as well as a lot of other fix-ins (if you ask). Mine came out just the right temperature and the chili and cheese were awesome! chili was flavorful and tasty, not too spicy. Dog was juicy and the bun was soft but stable. We ordered onion rings (which were not traditional but really good) and some potato salad. I was not a fan of the potato salad (it was lacking in basic spices, as well as it needed more mustard to tang it up) but that's okay, I would still go back for the dogs and rings! 

Reasonably priced, a pretty quick place to grab a hot dog/bratwurst, just like from a family 4th of july bbq!"}
{"text":"A long standing Tempe institution that proves that Hot Dogs can be eaten and even craved outside of ballparks.  A big plus to their onion rings.  A small minus for their boring out of a bag enriched buns."}
{"text":"Don't let the long line scare you, they're good at moving the customers through and with a friendly smile, to boot. They make fancy dogs and they're the huge diamondback dog style and thickness. They're pretty tasty. The only downside is maybe you'll pay a bit much for hello? a fancy hot dog. Their chocolate malt is this weird color of diarrhea, but again, don't let that fool you, because it's pretty cold and thick and tastes really good, but then, what's up with the off color? It's a shade you just wouldn't expect. When it's super busy, they run the risk of paper and junk on the floor but I saw an employee trying to keep up with picking it up. 

On one occasion I was stranded and nearly dehydrated (bad experience with the shitty bus system) and I was forced to take shelter here. They gave me water and nobody make a kink about having to purchase something while I waited for my husband to pick me up."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on the way to another restaurant and I'm so glad we stopped. The shakes are creamy goodness!! The owner was grilling the dogs and each one has the crispy flame grilled taste. I got a white hot and all beef, both were fantastic. My Dad is from NY so it was too cool finding a place in Az that serves white hots. This is the perfect place if you're craving old school, made to order food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good fresh cooked hot dog, or sausage, this is the place to go! They cook the meat while you are waiting in line, which I thought was pretty cool. It was actually kind of intimidating at first, if you don't know what to do.
The sausage was good, although pleas note that 1 is more than enough!
The fries and onion rings are good too! 

If you're ever in the area and want a good hotdog or sausage, stop by Ted's!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times before and all was well. Today's effort by the staff needed improvement. Forgot a corn dog for the guy in front of me, forgot the onion ring topper for one of my burger's so the burger sat getting cold and our hot dog getting cold. The girl putting the onion ring on the burger rushed the burger to the tray so the top roll fell on the dirty counter. No one apologized for that or the food getting cold. They also spilled the guy behind me's pickle from his hot dog on the counter.  Today's crew needs some re-training. Best part was the lady cleaning tables. She was very courteous."}
{"text":"A Really Good HotDog.

I have never been a big fan of hot dogs however, my nephew is so off to Teds we went.  The line at Ted's was long but moved quickly  ( don't let the length of people waiting in line be discouraging). As your waiting in line the  person on the grill will ask you what you would like to order, it's not really shouting but more of a long distance conversation. I actually found ordering that way to be kind of fun.

The hotdogs are shipped in from Buffalo, NY. The charbroiled hot dog have a great flavor and there are so many toppings to choose from. I had one with homemade chili, cheese and onions. It was fantastic. I especially liked the chili. I also ordered the onion rings and they were also very good so if you like hotdogs give Ted's a try."}
{"text":"Always very clean. All ingredients are of the highest quality. Although \"hotdogs\" are in the name, their burgers and chicken are also very good. As well as their shakes, fries and onion rings. The restaurant is also on the Tempe bike path. Fair prices, and military discounts are offered. The staff is very friendly, and the only downside is the wait. Avoid during lunch hours if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is a darn good hot dog, ask them to grill your bun too. I would have given it 5 stars but the onion rings were limp and greasy, I'll try the fries next time. Save some of the chile sause on the side for the fries."}
{"text":"Every so often, a place reminds you of what true quality means. I get that to some people it's \"just a dog\" or \"just a sausage\" but to the yelper/foodies out there, TRUST AND BELIEVE THAT TED'S IS THE REAL DEAL.

I've been coming here since the 90's - White Hots, Italians, All Beefs, Brats, Chili Dawgs...whatever your pleasure, Reds will hook you up. 

Fries, onion rings, shakes - ALL also legit. 

If ya don't know, now y'know..."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a funky throwback ambiance make this place a fun alternative to delicious food.  I love a good hot dog, but I'm not convinced that Ted's serves one.   Still, it may be worth a trip to bask in their quirky ambience... And who knows, maybe one of their Loganberry milkshakes.  

But, hotdogs, I'll cozy up to a Sonoran stand next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"We love Ted's and the great grilled pork hot dogs plus all there other items but a Ted's hot dog is the best.  Since moving west from upstate NY we are looking for a pork hot dog (not a sonoran but true all pork) like you find at Ted's.  We are in the Tucson area and we really wish a Ted's would open up here.  Does anyone know outside of Ted's where one can find a real pork hot dog in this region? The best we can do now is order from a website called buffalofood.com.  Appreciate any info.Thanks"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Maybe I did not get the right thing. Who knows. I did NOT enjoy my Chicago-style hotdog, despite all of the reviews saying how good the dogs are here. 
My friend experienced the same thing. Granted, these \"Chicago-style dogs\" were not on the menu and had to be improvised, (which I am shocked they were not on the menu...) and they were also missing some key ingredients. 

It was an average to below average hot dog that I could have done better at home. I would take a Sonoran style hotdog or a Chicago dog from a little road/parking lot stand any day over these hotdogs. 


IMHO, check it out and see for yourself, or save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Ted's is an homage to the Buffalo NY hot dog stand food from which this indie chain derives its roots.  I first started going to Ted's years ago in Tempe. I like their white hots , polish dog and regular dogs. Fries are great when they are hot. Shakes are excellent since they are made from ice cream on the spot. Make sure your fries are hot when you get them . Other than that, it's a great little hot dog stop. Toppings are gratis except chili cheese."}
{"text":"Tried a foot long with onion rings.  The hot dog was good, and a great value.  The onion rings were just ok, they were more like strings than rings.  Overall I see why this place stays so busy, it's good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Show me a better hot dog in AZ!  I'm from Chicago and this is a good dog!  I can't get enough of the spicy relish. You have to try it!  The service is usually horrible, but that is something I've come to love about hot dog joints coming from Chicago.  Ted's is great and it's really inexpensive!  Oh and they finally accept debit/credit cards!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Ted's. Went with a native of buffalo so was schooled on what to order and how to get the dog dressed.  Had the original footlong loaded with double hot sauce and it was the bomb. The homemade onion rings hit the spot too. I will definitely do this again and again and again.  I cant even imagine life without a visit to Ted's now."}
{"text":"Moved away from AZ 14 years ago so had to hit Ted's on a recent visit.  Not as thrilled any more.  Foot long hot dog was expertly cooked and tasted wonderful but overwhelmed by a too big bun.  Onion rings were superb until you got under the first layer and then they were like onion \"pieces\" and not fresh at all.  Chocolate shake excellent.  My biggest gripe is a twenty+ customer line being serviced by one guy on the grill and one guy fixing the hot dogs who was working at a snail's pace.  Nice memories but who knows if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I just got done moving my kid into ASU and remembered how my father had taken me to teds so many times as a child. We got down there and waited in the usual line but it smells so wonderful with the burgers and hotdogs on the grill. The wait was very short and actually took our order as we waited in line with the tablet. Hot dogs are still unbelievably great felt like I was a little kid again. The french fries were monstrous and quantity and I got the sweet and spicy sauce which is like a fry sauce on the side went perfect with them. My wife gave me some of her onion rings to share and they were equally as good. Before I end this review I've got to say their malts are the best I've ever had outside of New York City. Even the staff came by to ask if they could take our trays for us and we're so courteous as we're getting our meal. One of the best places we're eating that in a very long time get to know the more things change the more they stay the same"}
{"text":"Awesome hot dog place. I love the grilled hot dogs and they have, hands down, the best onion rings!"}
{"text":"Wonderful quality of food- just a bit pricey for the portions other than the foot-long hot dog (although I'd much prefer one of the more sausage like meats)"}
{"text":"As far as hot dogs go this place PWNS all. Nothing better than a wonderful grilled hot dog. This place is simple and yummy! I have also had the grilled chicken sandwich was amazing. If you live here and like hot dogs but haven't been to Ted's you need to re-evaluate your life and get a hold of yourself."}
{"text":"These dogs could not be any better. Absolutely fantastic ! had the jumbo and the brat. Both were AWESOME ! Great potato salad and onion rings too. I will be back."}
{"text":"1. Hot dog was grilled just right and good size.
2. Hot dog and fries could have a lil more flavor.
3. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Do you like going to the county fair?  Are you from back east?  Do you just like eating something that tastes so good that you know it's bad for you?  If you're nodding your head, you'd like Ted's.

What do you need to know about a hot dog restaurant?  Well, first you need to know what you want.  I've seen people walk in the door and immediately be asked, \"what are you having sir?\"  In addition to regular hotdogs, they've got footlongs, jumbo all-beef, white hots (veal & pork), bratwurst, polish sausage, italian sausage, and burgers.

You also need to know what you want on it- and this place has lots of options.  Ketchup, mustard, hot sauce (sweet and peppery), onions, relish, dill pickle spears, pickled peppers and onions, sauerkraut, chili, and nacho cheese are all available.

But the most important thing you have to know is that they ONLY TAKE CASH.  If you screw up and order food without having the green to pay for it, they might hold it for you while you run a quarter-mile across the parking lot to the ATM.  But wouldn't you rather just be part of the cool crowd who can read the giant signs on the doors that read \"CASH ONLY\"?"}
{"text":"When I'm craving a hot dog, Ted's Hot Dogs is the place to go in Tempe. Now that sentence does contain pretty many qualifiers; I do, of course, have to be craving hot dogs; and I wouldn't drive any great distance to feed that craving. 

Nonetheless, Ted's is decent for many reasons. All hot dogs and hamburgers are charcoal grilled, the sides are served in large portions, and they have many different toppings. 

Now there is another very similar charcoal grill restaurant in Tempe that offers hot dogs and hamburgers -ach*chuckbox*oo- but their fare is more hamburger friendly. Ted's offers regular, foot long, and all beef franks, as well as Italian, Polish, and White Hot Sausages. Anything char-grilled is  good in my book, but the Italian sausage with peppers and onions is great. They also have the traditional toppings like ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, tomato, etc. 

The sides are dropped right when you order them, served in a basket wrapped in paper to hold it all together.  Both the fries and onion rings are good, but I prefer the fries because of the batter on the rings. While only having two side items is limited, they are a decent price.

There is one thing that I don't recommend ordering here, which is why I give them three stars instead of four. Coming from Cincinnati, one of the most important preparations of a hot dog is the chili cheese coney. I went here tonight in search of a coney similar to that of Skyline in Cincinnati: a fried dog served on a steamed bun with bean-less, finely ground chili and heaps of shredded cheese. No charcoal grilled hot dog should be covered in chili, the chili itself is pretty thick, the cheese was nacho cheese, and the hot sauce was more like salsa. I definitely will never order a chili cheese dog here again. 

That being said I would point anybody in need of a grilled hot dog or sausage to Ted's."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I ever had...Char broiled with special chili sauce is outstanding. Milk shakes are the best and try the Loganberry for a nice alternative to sodas.
I always pick up some Webers mustard when I run out... 
Fast service (these guys know how to handle a long line at lunch) and friendly help."}
{"text":"It's been a long long long time since I visited Ted's. almost 25 years. The siren song of the char boiler lured me like a lusty sailor.

But alas, the ordering was dangerously disarranged. No methodology to the mayhem with orders being criss-crossed and bumble -f'd.

The dog was good, but not as delicious as my memory. Ah we'll...."}
{"text":"When I knew I was moving from Buffalo to Phoenix I was pumped to know I could still get a Ted's fix. Many locations around WNY, and I believe this is the only one outside the area. Love the Buffalo decor and you can even read the Buffalo News. Now the food: best hog dogs (Sahlens) in this area for me (not into the Chicago style and haven't given Sonoran a fair shot.) they have added a lot to their menu over time, but I stick with the classics- regular dog, regular cheeseburger (everything on them), fresh cut rings, and Loganberry. The hot sauce is dynamite and they sell it by the jar. Feel like I'm back in Buffalo when I'm in this place, thanks Ted"}
{"text":"Ted's offers a pretty good dog.  I'm not crazy about hot dogs but this person I know couldn't shut up about them so I had to fill the craving.  Ted's did the trick.

Very friendly, quick service, delicious dog, great toppings."}
{"text":"So you know how you crave hot dogs like a couple times a year?  Yeah... well it was America's birthday and we were craving a hot dog - I had already tried Portillo's and this was on my short list of places that were semi-close AND open on the 4th.  

I got the bacon wrapped (Sonoran) jumbo dog and had a bite of their cheeseburger.  The dog had the snap I wanted (natural casing) and was flavorful and juicy - just like I had hoped.  Tried a sip of the Loganberry shake and that was fresh and tasty.

We weren't the only ones who had this thought, as the place does not accept phone in orders and the line was quite long... but once I got to the counter the service was pretty good and by the time we got home the food was still warm.

Next year when I'm craving a good dawg, I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Gah, I hate when a local institution like Ted's slides so far downhill that a bad review is warranted. Sometimes you should just leave well enough alone. This is not high cuisine, nor is it supposed to be. Ted's used to serve the real deal - great NY style dogs, brats, and kielbasa. The line went out the door, but they kept it moving. Now some kid with a iPad takes your order and on this Sunday afternoon I waited 10 minutes for a dog and a polish? And to top it off... both were cold. Looks like they spent a lot of money remodeling too. The old decor was just perfect - old pictures on the wall, wood paneling. Now it looks like some generic fast food concept you'd find in any mall food court.

Sorry, Ted's, but I think I just ate my last dog..."}
{"text":"I'll pass on Ted's...not sure what the rave is about--maybe the name and the length of time they've been open. It was crazy packed and the line wrapped around--with one register there has to be a more efficient way. We likely spent 20 minutes just in line. I'm not a fan of their sweet but not so tasty chili. Their milkshake was good and the spilt was okay they were lukewarm so couldn't get the full effect. I'll stick with Detroit Coney Island down on Broadway...great chilli dogs! 

However, customer friendly and very kind staff!!! And clean!!!! That is hard to come by."}
{"text":"Only when I can get away with it will I treat myself to Teds. Normally I am not a hotdog guy but this place does it right. They have you order while standing in line and by the time you pay your dog is cooked. Great shakes"}
{"text":"Since I live in Tempe, I attempt to find good places to grab quick noshes that are NOT chain or fast food joints. One of my favs is Ted's or a dog, white hot, or polish. 

All of them great fresh charbroiled and smothered in Teds famous chili sauce, onions and mustard. The onion rings and corn dogs are winners too.

One recommendation to a first timer. Take cash and do not go at lunch. Really packed with long lines at lunch. My only other knock is the weak soft drink selection.

Ted's is so good that Z's Chicago dog opened across the street and lasted all of three months as nobody went. If  Z's opened in any hood in town they would've rocked but not against Ted's of Buffalo."}
{"text":"Ted's seems to take great pride in it's hot dogs. It's a cool, little spot in Tempe. I wasn't overly impressed with the footlong hot dog I'd ordered, and the orange cream shake was okay. Next time I'll try an all-beef dog and see if makes me love this place as much as others seem to. I'm giving it four stars for now; my next visit could tip it in either direction."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place is so popular,very average food at best and OVER PRICED.You can get far better quality at Portillos.They don't even offer Italian beef sandwiches.I really wanted to like this place but by Chicago Standards it is sub-par ! Skinny winners,uninspired hamburgers,I have ate here four times,not worth the drive.I can't believe people give this place 5 stars,makes me wonder where they normally dine."}
{"text":"This place has AWESOME hot dogs!  They are thick and juicy on a delicious warm bun.  The fries are pretty great too.  Be warned that there is a wait here, but it goes pretty quickly and there is a reason why people line up for these things."}
{"text":"Freshly made while you wait.  Grilled on a grill.  Watching them prepare it was interesting.  Very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY.
Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though I'll still take a good Chicago dog any day).
I know where I'll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot. :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  I was excited to try this place after reading so many of the great reviews, and when Rand suggested we go here for lunch I was all for it.  

I had a regular hot dog, yes they are grilled (not flame grilled) but the hot dogs are sitting out on the back of the grill before they're put on the hot part.  I thought the hot dog was bland and not very tasty, even after adding some spicy mustard, onions, pickle and tomato.  The onion rings were fresh, but super greasy and the batter had no flavor at all.  A little salt would have done wonders, and I rarely put salt on anything.  I even like my french fries unsalted.

I do give them a star for having diet Dr Pepper though!

Give me a Vienna hot dog any day over Ted's.

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I visited this \"Tempe institution\" last night and I enjoyed myself. Good customer service, good food. My friend and I both had the all-beef jumbo dog and fries. I like that they have veggie options and gluten-free buns. I also appreciated that they had dill pickles and not just sweet pickle relish. 

I had a great time - very mellow and laid back...perfect for two friends who like hot dogs and good conversation.

When I come back, I think I want to try the 'white hot\" sausage and a milkshake."}
{"text":"My mistake going here for lunch. Ordered doublebacon cheese burger w/ onion ring and a regular dog. You know, from their hall of flame menu board. They acted as if they had never heard of it before, and made it to their order not mine.
 Crew so big of hurry they did not put bacon or onion ring on burger. Lettuce was pulled soaking wet from bin and put on burger making bun a soaking wet mess. Burger came up before the people ahead of me. It sat there incomplete and soaking wet. Then they forgot the regular hot dog. Charged me for everything including onion rings i didn't order. Hot dog bun was ICE cold. Burger bun a wet mess and w/o bacon. I got refund for onion rings i did not order and they put a cold onion ring on my slop burger. Ordered and paid for but did not get what i ordered. Strange they had plenty of time to bullshit with ASU sports idiots. But not enough time to get customers order right. I drove 56 miles round trip and got screwed out of money and a decent hot meal."}
{"text":"Ted's cooks dogs the way many of us do in our yards, grilled and charred. Try finding dogs like that anywhere else.

Yeah, the dogs are pricey but they are cooked in front of you and there's a choice of beef dogs or pork. Onion rings and fries are side options.

For an old building it's kept very clean. You don't seem to find yourself cleaning up someone else's mess just so you can sit down. Of course I avoid the place during weekday lunch crowds where the line gets pretty long. 

I like the \"What can I get you?\" New York deli ordering style that they employ to get the line moving quicker. Once one customer's order is thrown on the grill they're asking the next person in line what they want whether that person is standing up at the counter or not.  It''s efficient and keeps the line moving."}
{"text":"You'll probably have to wait in a line and it's a bit pricey. A footlong, fries and a shake ran me about $10. However, it's actual charcoal grilled and it tastes delicious! This is the 2nd or 3rd time I have been here, and since it's close to where I live, I will be back. It's worth it it go here versus Weinierscnitzel  down the street."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*
Went to Ted's today for lunch. I guess I was lucky because while there was a line, it wasn't out the door and I was able to sit inside and enjoy my food. 
I had 2 regular hot dogs, fries and a soda. I love char grilled food, so I enjoyed my hot dogs. I especially loved the spicy relish!! It was perfect, not overwhelming at all. The fries were nice and crispy, maybe a little too greasy for my taste.
I moved here from NYC were Papaya's is the hot dog king and I do like them better. 
That being said, I liked Ted's and will visit again. Next time, I'll ask for extra spicy relish."}
{"text":"OK, I hail from Western NY State. I have been here many, many times. When you walk into Ted's be ready, there is always a line. You can got at 3PM, lines, forget lunch or dinner hour, long lines out the door. However, I can say that they are well organized, the line moves, so like in the Seinfeld episode with the soup Nazi, be ready to order ( No, they will not throw you out if you are not ready). Now to know a NY Hot, you have to know that they are best served char broiled. The flavor is fantastic. Then you must know that they have regular hots, polish sausage and even burgers. If you are from NY state you know the White hot is the NY state secret. Everything at Ted's is tasty. The onion rings are good and the milkshakes are delicious. This is the only restaurant that Ted's has in Arizona, they have 6 or more locations in Buffalo, NY. Was at Ted's in Buffalo last year and it was not as good this location and the manager of that restaurant yelled at the customers. 

Enjoy the NY State experience."}
{"text":"Food and service are both amazing! The quality is always consistently great.
Whenever I'm in the area around lunchtime I can't help but stop in, but be sure to be early because it gets packed around noon.
My favorite is the Brat with peppers and onions"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!

Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice."}
{"text":"if you like charred hot dogs burgers and brats and polish this is the place! every time i go, i get a reg hot dog(chi style), small cheese burger and onion ring(there yummy) and its great every time no other place is like this in the valley. its all good stuff, but i don't like the spicy relish and if you say Chicago style they will but this stuff on there. and if you go there between 12 and 2 there will be a huge line! it goes by fast tho, and it gives you time to watch them poke and stab your meat!"}
{"text":"Couldn't find a place with a good Hot Dog and Burger. But finally did!!! Here at Teds they char broil your dogs and burgers right in front of you! Nice, very nice. I like my dogs Chard, Yummy!!! Plus when they are ready you can look at the condiments they have and just let the girl know what you want on it and how much, a BIG plus. 

Fries are good and hot, fresh! 
Onion Rings are tasty and fresh too. 

Have not tried their shakes but i see they make them with real ice cream. 
Might add one to my order next time. 

One thing, it does get packed during lunch time and on weekends nights. so get there early. or prepare to wait!!"}
{"text":"Went here after stumbling home from the Tempe Beer Festival a while back - I live around the corner. 

I do enjoy some char on my dogs, but I'm not as fond of the smokiness of Ted's. If you like this sort of thing, you'll love these. I'd tried Ted's once before and again, even in my inebriated state, I was thrown off a bit by it. Being from Chicago, Lobby's wins for me on the dog front. For fries, though, I'd give it to Ted's. Get them with the cheese and die happy. 

I also agree with others here that there is a certain charm about the place and having staff take your order through long distance shouting as you wait in line and aren't quite certain whose turn it is. 

If I was looking for a meal of cheese fries I'd come here in a heart beat. For hot dogs though I'll probably be waiting till the next beer fest."}
{"text":"Ted's Hot Dogs are the best I have ever had, anywhere.

The burn factor... Ted's has a toasty bed of coals over which they turn your hot-dog bratwurst or white-hot into the ugly blackened sausage of your dreams. 
Don't order fries or rings unless you have some help. The dogs themselves are the main event! I can't finish the foot long! Be warned they are HUGE!

This is one of my favorite places for a date. I'm a weirdo I guess, but nothing says \"I love you,\" like a good as they come fuss-free meal at rock bottom prices. If your date is too high maintenance to stand in line for a hot-dog -maybe it wouldn't work out anyway?"}
{"text":"Went just after 4pm... business was slow and the line was even slower... stood there for over 10min, only two people ahead of us. The line didn't budge. My son and I left."}
{"text":"I am donning my flame suit now...

I did not enjoy Ted's. I did not enjoy my hot dog. I did not enjoy my trip there that much. I got a footlong because I was that hungry. I ate about a 1/4 of it...and am still slightly hungry. The bun was too crusty, they drowned it in ketchup so much that the bun was breaking at the bottom where it joined.

...That and some of the customers were just...RUDE. I got shoved out of the way by granny with a terrible bun on the top of her head. I had to curb my initial reaction of pulling out my scissors to cut it. I CUT YOU!  We were also getting the stink eye from someone who had ZERO rights to be giving us that kind of glare with her robin's egg blue eyeshadow. She was so 70s that she's just barely back in style...and failed in her attempt at putting on her black cake eyeliner like Cleopatra. I guess these people were hungry or something...but no need to knock me over and shove my husband in your bid to get the hot dawg in yer tummy!

Rudeness and oddball people aside, I found the actual workers extremely friendly and courteous -- that made the whole experience a lot more redeeming. I loooved their fries. Best damn fries I've ever had. They made up for that mess of a hot dog. Hubby had the onion rings. OH.MY.GOD. Best goddamn motherf****ing onions rings e v a r -- E V A R  --- EVARRR!!1!!!!

The smell alone of the place made my mouth water, but the hot dog made me so sad. Maybe I'll try it again, but I'll make sure to go when the freaks aren't out..

For now, Ted's gets 3 stars. I'd have given them 2, but they serve Pepsi (woot!!!) and their fries and onion rings gave me happy tummy, even if their hot dogs fell short of what I was expecting..."}
{"text":"When I lived in the East Valley some five years ago, I used to go here all the time, loved the chili dogs. However, after my last tow trips there, the last one being today, I think I have to say farewell to Ted's. I don't mind the lines since they ask you for your order while well back in line (Although they should wait until you check out to pour your drink, the ice was about gone by the time I got my iced tea) but the dogs were kind of burnt and chili lacked any kind of zing what so ever. For 10 bucks, I would expect more."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Teds Hot Dogs on a Friday evening, it was both of ours 1st time there and we were not disappointed. We too have to say Ted's Hot Dogs are among the best in the valley and how lucky are we to have Ted's out of his 7 locations, mostly being in the New York area, we have one in Tempe AZ!  Once you walk in you see where the line is forming, don't be alarmed, it's really not a slow moving line, once in line you place your order you can c watch your dog (or burger, but really who goes to a HOT DOG joint to order a burger?) cooking on a grill, getting plump and nice grill marks on them! Then once it is cooked, you will be asked what you want on it, now the chili cheese dog did look great but I went for an all-beef hot dog with mayo (that's how I like it) sliced pickles, grilled onions & peppers! BOY O BOY was it good!!  My friend ordered the foot long dog with chili. We also got some french fries & their freshly handmade onion rings, which were very good. They have other types of dogs on the overhead menu, brats, polish, white?, and reg dogs and the foot long & all beef.  Next time I will try the polish dog!"}
{"text":"Ted's is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs! Go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but it's well worth the wait. Great service along with great food and decent portions, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"In celebration of National Hot Dog Day, Thomas and I made a special trip to Ted's. I have never been there and I am now sad that I have been missing such a GREAT spot! 

I shouldn't go much further without stating that I do not like hot dogs. But when I finished my dog, I was contemplating getting another one. I got the 'all beef' with mustard, cheese sauce, chili, and onions and cheese fries. I wish I would've skipped the fries, I would have definitely been able to get another dog down.

The cheese sauce isn't worth the extra $.60 on the dog or the fries- you'll be much better off just skipping it."}
{"text":"I had high hopes to try their hot dogs.  I got the beef dog but it was ok, a little too charred for my taste.  The fries were great.  The wait in line was about 20 mins.  The place was packed due to an ASU game.  Some of the tables were dirty."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place to get a good hot dog. I mean we really are not flush with hot dog places everywhere you look, and they serve burgers too! Any type of sausage, dog, or brat you can think of. They grill it the way you want it too, so if you want it burnt, speak up! They use Aunt Hattie's bread which is okay in my book. It usually gets loud and crowded which is atmosphere here. It's basically the Subway of hot dogs (well, maybe Subway isn't cool enough, let's say Cheba Hut), you tell them what you want on it after it's done grilling. The onion rings are huge!"}
{"text":"Never been before but my husband had in the 70's. My current ASU student wanted to go. They nickle and dime you for any extras. They forgot bacon on my cheddar and bacon dog and had to recharge me. Dressing for the onions to dip in was 80 cents for a small container. The onions rings were not rings at all but two servings of pieces of deep fried onions that looked like the bottom of a bag that had been fried. Not impressed at all. To top is off they weren't busy."}
{"text":"Great place for a charbroiled hot dog. They do not grill it until you order it. Staff was very friendly. They actually talked to you and even gave you a smile. Their milkshakes are sooooo good. I was in love. The hot dog was tasty too. You can get a full meal at Ted's. I enjoy the vintage pictures on the wall along with the 50's/60's music. Fun place to eat and remember the times. 

Very clean restaurant plus there is always a line which means the food is good."}
{"text":"It's the same awesome place it used to be when I was a student in the 90s. You can smell the charcoal grill from the parking lot. The line forms early so be patient and get there early.  No drink refills and slightly pricey but worth it if you are in the neighborhood and want the great hot dog experience. If you are expecting something other than a great hot dog with a grilled smoked flavor than this may not be your place. It's not magic or new. The beauty is in the simplicity of a charred dog.

The stand outs are the white hot (veal) and and chili cheese dogs. I never remember the onion rings being this good so split a order with someone. Also they have lots of toppings so take advantage of that. I love kraut and peppers and they are no extra charge."}
{"text":"The dog itself was dee-lish. Crispy, grilled skin and a juicy inside...soft, steamed bun... But I made the mistake of ordering the chili cheese dog and the chili was awful. Seriously, resembled lumpy ketchup in both appearance and taste.
Battered, thin-cut onion rings were fine but only after I added quite a bit of salt.
Enjoyed the Loganberry Shake!
Next time, I'll keep it simple with mustard and red relish. The burgers looked pretty tasty too...
I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since high school and 10 years later it's still the best damn hot dogs I've ever eaten. Still the same dude working the grill!  Plus the condiments you can get are flat out ridiculous. mac N' cheese, bacon, hot sauce with relish... what's not to love? I saw a few people on here complain about their order system and gave 1 star. Feel free to direct yourself to Wiener-schnitzel down the street and get your terrible food delivered to your face hole within 2 minutes."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from this place and never tried it.  What was wrong with me?  If you want a no frills burger and fries or hot dog and onion rings with a hearty creamy milkshake, this is the place for you.  The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had.  They are flaky and thin and very crispy.  I love the sweet and spicy sauce to dip them in.  That sauce is also great on a burger.  I wasn't a huge fan of the hot dog.  It didn't have a ton of flavor.  The burger is the way to go in my opinion.  There is a large array of toppings and sauces you can get to customize it as well."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service was SOOOO slow.
Don't go in here if you have a quick lunch break. They aren't fast enough for that!"}
{"text":"Some of the best dogs I've had in Arizona. Tried out the regular hot dogs, and all beef jumbo.

Both had great flavor and a crunch to the outer skin (good char). I also ordered up the Loganberry shake but was not really a fan (especially for the price).

Had the onion rings, and they're delicious. They don't really feel oily etc.

Overall, will definitely hit up this place again."}
{"text":"Its pretty bizaare that all other location of Ted's are in the Western NY area, an then there is one here. But I'm not complaining! I was skeptical to try their white hots, but I can honestly say that I've been missing out. The lines get pretty long, but its definitely worth the wait. At Ted's they grill up your order right in front of you. Hot dogs dont get any better than this."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware! There's not much of interest here for you unless you like a good crispy French Fry. This is a student staple because of the larger portions and rock bottom price (it's practically cheaper than a McDonald's these days). 

There is a ton of cool sporting and Ted's memorabilia on the wooden walls, and the ceiling has these goofy light panels that make it look like the blue sky, except faded from the lights. 

This place is usually jam-packed on the weekends but things move QUICK. The person at the grill usually shouts for your order when you are 3-6 people from the grill, so pay attention! The employees love it when things move like clockwork. 

A great place, but usually one I save for a hangover day."}
{"text":"Only my second time here, but it is always packed with people saying it's the best dogs in The Valley."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overcrowded for no reason. My hat goes off to Ted for whatever he is putting in the Kool-Aid, because everyone seems to think this place is a big deal.

The line is this place is always to the door and you can expect to wait 20 minutes before you even order. The prices don't match the taste, and I will never eat here again. Be prepared to drop $10 to get 1 burger and a small portion of fries."}
{"text":"I am from upstate New York so I must warn you that this review may be a little biased. Any place that has a white hot dog on their menu is going to be a favorite of mine. The onion rings were also yummy and next time I want to try a milk shake!. I definitely recommend stopping in. Ted's is a unique restaurant that makes me miss upstate NY!"}
{"text":"As a hot dog lover i was very unimpressed. Had the chilli cheese footlong. It was cold and the non steamed, grocery store bun was dry. The chilli was bland and the whole thing looked like it was made by someone with Parkinsons. To top it off it was expensive. Yeah i have made better for way cheeper."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of toppings for any size burger or dog. Great grilled flavor. They finally started accepting credit cards too!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place. I came by recommendation from a neighbor, and ordered a charcoal burger. It came on a paper plate and looked like something you would eat at a picnic. It was small and hardly enough to satisfy me, even with fries (which were bland). It wasn't bad... Just under average. Even worse, as I stepped up to order, I said, \"I heard the burgers here were really good!\" and the guy working replied \"oh, who told you that?\" and looked genuinely surprised. Well his reaction basically summed up my experience there. I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews, maybe the dogs are better."}
{"text":"This place is good, especially if you are looking for gluten-free options because they offer gluten free buns.  Prices were extremely inexpensive.  However, my issue was not the food, but the long lines and the lady by the cooker yelling out to people to get their order when they are 10-15 feet away so you don't even know if she is talking to you or someone else."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time has a regular hot dog and a split of fries and onion rings along with a chocolate shake. The hot dog was okay, shake was good, the fries were ok, the onion rings were not good. Long line at 1100 a.m. on a Saturday. 
The next time I took company. We had regular hot dogs, a sea dog, a brat, a jumbo dog, large order of fries and a strawberry shake. Start with the good, the strawberry shake was delicious. Same as last time, the regular hot dogs were ok. The rest was not. The fries seemed to be the end of the batch and didn't seem like a large. The brat and the jumbo dog were not great. The sea dog was terrible. All this after a long line and a $30 bill.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is like a hot dog stand that grew roots and turned into an establishment.  The fine folks at Ted's sure do know how to prepare and serve up a proper dog amongst other delightful varieties of wieners.

Ted's, a restaurant worth sharing."}
{"text":"I had not been here since my college days and had forgotten that Ted's serves up the best onion rings in town! The rings come highly recommended with any order. We came (party of 2) on a Friday night and there was pretty much no wait. The smell of the charbroiled hot dogs definitely brought back some salivating memories. My go to is always the Classic White Hot Dog with sauerkraut, onions, mustard, and a pickle spear - pretty darn tasty. They do offer burgers, but I can never deviate from that delicious wiener in my mouth.

The service here is always quick considering they cook the food in front of you. Remember to get the rings - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome all beef hot dog & Corn dog. Warning: not a place to sneak off to.  We came back to work smelling of grilled smoky food. Happy problem. Love Ted's."}
{"text":"Took the short 15 minute drive out to Broadway and McClintock today and ordered up an all-beef hot dog with chili, cheese and onions, and an Italian Sausage dog with mustard, ketchup and a pickle. Both dogs were near perfect.  Some nice char on both dogs providing a good crunch. The only suggestion would be to amp up their chili a little bit.  It's pretty bland, but is otherwise fine.  I meant to get a side of hot sauce, but forgot.  I think that might have improved the chili cheese dog a bit.  The Italian sausage was mildly spicy with very good flavor. I also had the onion rings.  I thought they were very good.  Nice strong onion taste and fresh and hot.  

I was there on a Saturday morning just after 11, and there at least 15 people in line ahead of me.  That being said, the line moves fairly quickly.  They are efficient at what they do - don't wait until the last second to make your decisions.  They griller will yell out well ahead in line asking what you want.  Be prepared to yell your order out to him as he'll need to be able to hear your from a little bit of a distance.  They need to do this to get the dogs on the grill for you so that by the time you get to the condiment man, your dogs will be ready.  You'll just need to repeat your order to the condiment person so he knows which ones to grab, then you tell him what you want on each one.  Then he hands your completed order off to the cashier - and your done.  By the time I left, there were at least 30 people in line.  It's a pretty popular place - with good reason.  All the staff I interacted with were very friendly.

It's a good thing for my general well-being and overall health that this place isn't closer to me.  I would eat there a lot.  As it is, it's just far enough away that I'll go maybe once every 2-3 months."}
{"text":"Grabbed a veggie dog with my wife this afternoon.  Unbelievable!  Veggie dogs can be hit or miss and Ted's definitely does it right.  Topped it with mustard, ketchup, relish, tomatoes, sauerkraut and Ted's famous hot sauce.  Definitely get the hot sauce regardless of your topping choice.  We saw a lady topping hers with Mac & cheese.  Maybe I'll give that a go next time!!"}
{"text":"mmmm, Ted's is sooo good! I love their onion rings. Great hot dogs too.
My complaints about Ted's, they only accept cash. I never carry cash, so I rarely eat at Ted's and anytime I go there is a huge line, but I can deal with that, they try and get everyone through pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Over-hyped and mediocre. Apparently people have never had a char-grilled dog with natural casing. Overall they are not cheap for what you get. Never been impressed by this place despite eating here a half dozen times. The hot dogs at Joe's farm house grill, Sonoran style dogs from Nogales hot dogs, and Short leashes dogs are wayyyy tastier.

TLDR..... MEH"}
{"text":"This is my first time and last time ever I ordered a chessbuger and it was not cook all the way"}
{"text":"Who knew you could do so much with a hot dog??

These guys have to be doing something right to have been in business so long, and the tasty hot dog I ate backed up that theory all the way from hungryville to fat-and-happy town. 

I think these guys must be the only people who still cool on actual charcoal inside a restaurant. They seem to have a pretty tight system going where they get your order and start it going so that by the time you get to the cashier your order is ready to go. I did feel like it was a little crowded in the kitchen, with staff kinda falling over each other, but the food came out quickly and tasting good. So whatever works.

They did get the order a little wrong, but it was lunchtime and packed, so not the end of the world. 

Glad I visited - felt like I got a small slice of what 1950s hot dog America was like :)"}
{"text":"Great dogs!  Done the right way.  Quality product with all the fixins!  Don't think a hot dog could taste any better.  A Tempe landmark.  Don't visit without stopping at Teds.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday, had the White Hot and onion rings. They were so yummy.

I went today for lunch, twice. Yes, I had a Polish and Dr Pepper. It was really great. I planned to get another one, but noticed about 35 people waiting in line. I decided to wait it out, sat in my car, I needed to make some phone calls anyway.

Flash forward an hour later, the line is still around 30 people, and no, not the same people. The line is constantly flowing. I don't understand how the cook can keep track of who ordered what, but he does.

The second time around for lunch, I took an Italian dog to go. By the time I got my dog, the line was still all the way across the lobby. I saw a few people come and go without waiting, I assume that they did not want to wait.

I love how they BBQ the dog as they are ordered.

If I lived in Tempe, or even in a nearby area, I think I would go there often. I about 8 hours away. I will add this place to my list of places to go whenever in the Phoenix area.

The ONLY complaint I can find about this place is the long line. The problem with that complaint, is that the cause of the complaint is a direct result of every compliment that be made about this place.

This place kind of make think of an \"American\" version of Tito's Tacos (In Los Angeles on Sepulveda Place) in the aspect of simple delicious food, fast service."}
{"text":"Can NOT rave enough about this place. I love it so much!! It's the only one in AZ which is awesome!! Line is out the door during lunch hours no matter what day...just goes to show how popular it is!"}
{"text":"Great hotdogs. Pretty simple toppings, but this place is def. more classic than adventurous.

Hotdog, fries, onion rings, all are good. Don't be discouraged by the lines, as it moves quickly. Be ready for your order, as they will take orders as fast as they can."}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3.5 stars.  Ted's is definitely institutionalized as a Tempe tradition and landmark, and I can respect that.  And I guess as far as char-grilled hotdogs and diner burgers go, they really are quite satisfying, although subject to the occasional stale bun or overfried side.  So why can't I get myself to give it 4 stars, despite about 15 visits over the last 13 years?

Is it the crowds?
Is it the patently obvious middling meat quality?
Is it the value (or lack of value) per item for stuff that isn't particularly difficult to imitate - and imitate perfectly  - at home?
Is it the distance from where I live (north Phoenix, although I lived for many years in Tempe)?
Is it the lighting, the short-order style line, or posters on the wall?

I dunno.  I really don't.  But whatever it is (perhaps its the cumulative effect of all-of-the-above, none of which are too troubling individually), I uniformly have an A-OK yet ho-hum visit whenever I go to Ted's.  I suppose when nothing short of a hot dog will do, I will continue to go there, but I wouldn't drive 25 miles out of my way to pay $32.50 for a family of four for good (but not great) picnic food.

*sigh*"}
{"text":"Was back in town for a friend's wedding and I came to Ted's the next morning.  I went to ASU and used to eat here all the time.  It is as good as I remember it.
I don't mess with the fries or onion rings anymore because I think they are just average.  Start my order with one red hot.  Then it's a chili cheese dog with onions.  
Awesome!!  

Always get one red hot and go from there."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE hotdog restaurant EVER!! My 4 kids know when it is mothers day, my birthday or ANY day this is my choice to celebrate!! It is a great location and the STAFF HERE IS AMAZING!! I have been coming to Ted's for over 10 years and keep coming back! Terat yourself to a great charcoal sandwich, fries, rings and homemade shakes....it is ALL AMAZING!! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs. These beauties are charcoal grilled so they have that authentic family picnic taste. I ordered a footlong chili cheese dog with the bun grilled and an order of onion rings. The hot dogs were great and the onion rings were dynamite. Everything is made in front of you, so no soggy dogs here! Whenever I'm back in this area, I'll be coming to Ted's."}
{"text":"Ted's is always awesome for a quick bite. They might have a line out the door but they're super efficient, fast and friendly. The food is always to die for: fresh and hot.
If it looks like there's a ton of people in there, don't be discouraged. The line moves faster than you'll ever realize and they take your order way before you're near the counter. It's not the same person preparing all of your food so its all getting done at the same time and you don't have to wait. They have a drink person, a grill person, a fry person, a shake person...
As long as you're okay with the Buffalo Bills pennants around the place (haha), you'll really enjoy your meal and experience here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Teds since I was a little girl! I have always loved their foot longs with cheese and cheese fries! They are amazing. It's a little slow in the like but they can't help it! It's still so amazing. I make my husband go every week."}
{"text":"This place has great hot dogs and a strong New York feel to it. Its the best place in Phoenix for hot dogs (yes there are better hot dog places in Tucson and throughout the US). The line can get long but its worth the wait. A must try if you live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ahh Ted's...where to begin.  For me it all started on a warm August day in the late eighties.  I was heading north from Tucson to start my undergrad career at ASU and the friend I was following drove straight to Ted's instead of Manzanita (Spanish for \"tall ugly dorm with many drunk kids\").  Thus began a love affair that only grows stronger to this day.  Footlong Chili Dogs got me through a lot of hangovers and somewhere along the way college came and went, grunge came and went and my mullet came and went.  Then after college it was the All Beef Jumbo that got me through the trials and tribulations of being young, single, and semi-gainfully employed -- a few less hangovers, but still plenty of nitrates.  Then as a slightly older family man the White Hot has emerged as the sausage of choice for weekend trips with the Toddlers.  I even purchased my most recent residence perhaps partially because Spiro (the owner and son of \"The Ted\") lives across the street (ok - so maybe not the best approach to real estate decisions, but clealy Hot Dog obsessions can't be blamed for the entire real estate bubble).  This place is one of the last old school ASU spots and I pray that Spiro has a succession plan in place if he ever decides to retire.

Update: It just occured to me that this posting could be a bit more \"review-ish\" and a bit less autobiographical, so here goes.  All the aftermentioned dogs are awesome.  The condiments are perfect...the mustard and \"hot sauce\" are proprietary and worth purchasing in jars to take home (the white hot with mustard, hot sauce, onions, and a pickel is as good as it gets).  The Chili is ideally matched with cheese and onions on the regular, footlong, and all beef jumbo.  The onion rings are the best in town.  The only complaint I have is the liquid cheese, but I've come to accept and even appreciate it a bit over the years.  The milkshakes are good, but a bit small for the price.  There...hopefully that's enough superlatives.  Get there before noon to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ted's for nearly 20 years. Very little has changed. They make properly char-broiled hot dogs and burgers, which is awesome in-and-of itself. Their onion rings are one-of-a-kind awesome. The service has always been friendly and super speedy. To top it off, they have always been an active supporter and heavily involved with the local community. What more could you possibly want?

I really wish Ted's was in SF. I miss this place. They're the best!"}
{"text":"Still as good as ever!
While nothing will compare to that first visit, the food is still just as good as the first day I went last summer. I've been maybe 5-6 times since then, and I've never been disappointed.
My favorite place to go for lunch in the summertime! I am sad that they changed their menu boards to be more modern, no more of the sliding letter-type boards of yesteryear :("}
{"text":"I love Ted's. It is easy to eat gluten free there and they even change their gloves when they handle GF items."}
{"text":"First time dining at this location due to many requests from my fianc√© to try them, and I can say I was really happy overall with the product, lemme break it down.

Decor- overall the restaurant is pretty cozy, made with plenty of seating inside, and some outside. Nothing too special, some decor on walls, but mostly made to have you sit, eat, and get out. The menu is on the wall, and somewhat easy to figure out.

Customer service- So I went to lunch and it was pretty busy. The line was at the door, so they had someone come out and take orders so the food would be ready when you arrive to the cashier. Friendly overall, nothing special though.

Food- LOVED the dogs, especially for the price. They were juicy, plump, and the onion rings are amazingly fresh! The only thing I wasn't excited about was the mac and cheese. Pretty bland, but can't complain too much.


Overall---- This place was well worth the trip for me. Make sure to be able to set aside time for their peak times, the line will be long. Their food is cooked to order, which I love. I have to return for their milkshakes and malts soon!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before the \"lunch rush\". It was clean and we had not too long of a wait. 
I feel like some of the menu items are a little over priced. It's nice that everything's charbroiled, gives it a nice flavor. When picking out the topping for our burgers and brats, they don't skimp on the toppings and I thought that was good!"}
{"text":"Teds was what I expected to be and more. The food was great. Has that homemade burger flavor and taste to it that I expect at like a bbq. I remember trying the split. The notion rings were really good. Only thing that would make the experience even better if the line was not so long and the ordering process was not a process. Over all really good food for great price."}
{"text":"There was a short line but it moved pretty fast. The grill cook was super friendly and chatted with the line, which all seemed to come out of the New York area, like the griller. 
Got two \"regulars\" with ketchup and a side of fries with chili and cheese. Not sure if it's because I ordered them to go or not, but the chili and cheese both came in to-go cups (with the chili being hot enough to almost completely melt the cup and lid) rather than on top of the fries. The two hot dogs were perfectly grilled and it comes on Aunt Hattie's brand buns - my favourite. I ordered the buns grilled too but because my order was taken by about three different people, that didn't happen. The chili seemed like Hormel brand without beans, but it was great. The side that came with my \"chili cheese fries\" was more than enough to also pour over my hot dogs. If you're getting dogs and fries, just order one side of each and it'll be plenty. The fries were thin sliced but really good  - perfectly crispy and fresh. 
Two dogs, a regular fry, a side each of chili and cheese, and a large soda came to just over $10. 
If you're craving for some classic American food, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Been dying to check out Ted's after hearing raving reviews from many friends. The branding and history of Ted's is really cool and the space is filled with awesome typography and old photos of the companies history. On my visit they played a ton of 50's music and the employee energy was great. They have a broad assortment of topping options and everything is grilled right in front of you. If you're craving a good hot dog this is one of the best I've had! Will be going again next time I travel to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are decent, onions rings are decent, service was a little strange and kind of rude, I will eat there again but I'd say a tad above average especially with all the hype I heard!"}
{"text":"My review:

Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.  

The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.

Tonight I had a chili dog and onion rings.  The onion rings ROCK! Yum!

Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ted's is AWESOME.

From the way they cook their dogs to the quality of their ingredients, you cant go wrong eating at Ted's. We always take people from out of town here and they all wish they had a Ted's in their town.

I always get an all beef w/ (my version of) Chicago style fixings. They have celery salt! Just ask!

I love their onion rings. As an onion enthuiest, Im never impressed w/ onion rings that are all batter. Ted's has the perfect amount. My hubby, being an onion hater, always goes for the cheese fries.

How can you NOT love Ted's?!"}
{"text":"I go there at least 2 times a month, mainly if I'm in the mood of a quick treat. I love their selection and I have tried all their main options. I like their italian, their polish, the bratwurst!!! and they even have a special mustard to complement all. YEs during Fri or Sat you can run into a big line...but that's part of their quality! if you want to go faster stop any other day!"}
{"text":"When you're in the mood to clog your arteries, Ted's is the place. This is the kinda place you need to go to on the weekends so when you're done eating you can go home and take a nap.

I love the atmosphere at Ted's. It's an old school hot dog joint that hasn't been updated in years, luckily. There is almost always a long line but it's worth the wait. The boyfriend and I always get regular hot dogs and and order or fries and an order of onion rings to share. 

Now their hot dogs are good, don't get me wrong, but they are char grilled so sometime I feel they get a little over done. Some people would say that kinda \"burnt\" quality is what makes it good but a few times my hot dog has been a little too charred. Their sides however are the best! They have skinny fries that are crisp and yummy and their onion rings aren't really rings it is more like onion strings. Sweet, salty, thin, greasy goodness. Get ranch or a side of cheese sauce for dipping - so good.

Ted's is one of those places you have to go to at least once, it's sort of a Tempe institution."}
{"text":"Well, after living in Phoenix, AZ basically all of my life; I finally got to try this place.  I honestly forgot about it for a bit, but then I saw the original Ted's featured on one of the food shows.  There was a short line to begin with but didn't take long for them to get through the line.  I placed my order (with the grill master) for a Jumbo Chili Cheese Dog, onion rings, and a med drink, which he called out.  It appeared they had a system down; unfortunately, I was wrong.  They forgot to put down my order of onion rings, or it went to someone else (don't know what happened there) and then they mixed up my drink cup size, with no drink cup...needless to say I had to wait another few minutes for them to cook an order of onion rings.  Not a real big deal, other than my chili cheese dog was getting cold.  Once the order was ready though, I took it and my tray of food to a table.  The onion rings really didn't taste like they were fully cooked based on the batter consistency and it was all \"clumped\" together, which was a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to them, they were the shoe string type of onion rings.  The chili cheese dog was ok, I do like char-grilled hot dogs, but nothing that really stood out to me to say wow.  But the buns they use are quality ones (I believe they are the potato buns).  I wouldn't mind though going back, when I'm in the area and trying a regular jumbo dog with my choice of traditional fixings...and will go with the French fries next time."}
{"text":"Pros:  good quality meat and flavorful toppings

Cons: $5 for a medium sized chili dog is a little pricey.  They need to pile on the toppings but they don't. 

Worth a try...."}
{"text":"Listen, we all know Ted's is delicious, it just is, so I will basically shy away from the food and let you know about the service of my most recent trip (last night) to Ted's. 
  Ted's closes at 9pm on Thursdays and myself plus fourteen friends showed up at their doors at 906pm, we just weren't thinking. We have all had that moment where we feel a little guilty for showing up at a restaurant so close to closing time and you just don't know what you should do, leave or stay, so I asked. I have to tell you, the staff seemed practically excited to see us! After hours! It was a nice change from the usual huffing and puffing I've gotten from similar trips to other restaurants. They were very welcoming and chatty, asking about our night and offering suggestions for our feast, even delivering some items straight to our tables. Service at its best, honestly wonderful.
  I've always really enjoyed Ted's dogs, last night I got two regular dogs, one with chili, cheese, and onions, the dog was grilled perfectly with a little snap to it and the chili was slightly sweet with a perfect kick to it, and the other had just their signature hot sauce (a spicy relish) and was just wonderful, I don't even like relish but it was sweet and spicy and tangy... just great.
  This trip has made me even more of a believer, no wonder Ted's has been a Tempe staple FOREVER! With service so exquisite and food so good, as my friend Adam said \"You simply can't say no to it\", I'll gladly spend many more nights in the dog house!"}
{"text":"Maybe because the of the large amount of hype and the ridiculously long line, we had unrealistically high hopes. Needless to say, we were disappointed when we finally sat down to eat. It was mediocre at best and we realized that we could have gone to Sonic down the street and gotten a similar quality burger and hot dog for cheaper. Maybe we'll give it another shot, but it was not a great first impression."}
{"text":"First time to Ted's was today. Been in Tempe eight years, and have been happy with Dave's Dog House but \"frank (ly), moving \"furter\" on........ Certainly popular, long line, I had a good 20 min. wait. I ordered the all-beef chili dog, with added mustard and onions. Somewhat average, I must say. Did not get a lot of chili with the dog, and chili was a little too sweet for my taste. Bun, plain, out of the bag, but the charcoaled dog certainly has a great taste. Potato salad really grew on me though! Not bad, I may be back if in the area."}
{"text":"Teds hot dogs are the best in town!!! I've never liked hot dogs until i ate at Teds. These aren't your regular hot dogs or sausages you find at your local chain grocery store. They use quality meats and natural casing and cook them over a charcoal grill. Best Hot Dog i have ever had hands down!"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure Ted's has its status as a go to place here in AZ because of nostalgia. There are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point. Ted's dogs are passable, their brats are just poor. The fries are awful. The last time I went there I had to fight vomiting for a bit after, I had two hot dogs (not usually a nausea inducing amount). Thankfully there are better places popping up all the time now. Better step it up Ted's all those people who've been going here for years are gonna die and you'll be out of luck. 

Also the teenage staff makes the experience no better!"}
{"text":"I am currently taking a summer school class at ASU and this is 5 minutes away. I know if I am a student at ASU, this is a place I will be frequenting.

My order: Footlong with ketchup, chips, and celery salt with fries. Cooked to perfection. Very polite staff and you see them handle your food (which is done in a clean manner). I am extremely glad I found this great hot dog joint this summer. 

One complaint: Be aware of the lines. Guarantee of at least 15 people long and takes at least 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Quite a delicious all beef hot dog. I got mine with ketchup, cheese, and hot sauce. I heard the White Hot is the thing to get."}
{"text":"Ted's is awesome.  It gets busy, but that's because it is awesome.  If you like \"American\" food that tastes great, give Ted's a try."}
{"text":"Saw this place on The Chive.com yesterday and here I am today.  This place doesn't mess around when it comes to serving up a proper dog.  The all beef was great, but the real shiner I felt was the Brat.  One of the best Brats I've had in Az, especially with the peppers and onions and a touch of the Ted's sauce.  And lastly the cheese sauce here is great, I could practically put it on anything and it'll make it even better.  Excellent place, I'll be back for a Loganberry shake and a polish next.  I would have taken one to go but the line was hella long."}
{"text":"Long wait, but I thought it would be worth it.  Great Burger... loved it.   But I went there for the coneys...   I could not finish it.  The chili is awful, it's more like red sauce than chili..   bun was a little stale...  if I am craving coneys, I won't go to teds."}
{"text":"I friggin' love hot dogs, and this place does NOT disappoint!

If you've ever been there you know there's probably going to be a long line when you arrive.. but you wait anyway because it's Ted's Hot Dogs and it's delicious! The line goes fast, and before you know you it you are up there placing your own order.

The menu is pretty simple: Hot dogs

But there's a variety of different kinds, ranging from your basic doggy, to delicious savory bratwurst, and various delicious sausage treats in between. They cook it right in front of you, as you direct the condiment distribution... my mouth is usually watering throughout this entire process.

I have never had a bad experience with Ted's, and although some people complain about the line I have never had it take more than 5-10 minutes to get through... and it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"The burgers are charbroiled goodness. They taste like summer barbecues and sometimes you just need that all American Burger. Teds is the place for that. 
As delicious as the food is what makes this place worth coming back to your time and time again is the friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"Yesterday's lunch choices were narrowed down to pok√© or hot dogs. Opposite ideas, I know. I chose Ted's since I hadn't been before. I arrived after 1 and there was a healthy line with one of the employees taking our order as we stood. 

I decided to get their veggie dog, fries with cheese, and a chocolate milkshake. Don't worry, I worked it off this morning. It took about 15 min to get through the line and when I got to the front, I chose my toppings and added ketchup, mustard, onions, jalape√±os, hot sauce and a pickle. There's a self-serve station with additional ketchup, utensils, napkins and drinks.

My hot dog was teeny compared to the other sausages! I read that in a review and how someone ordered two, should've done the same. The dog was good, the cheese container I got had so much in it! So I ate it with my fries and also dunked my hot dog in it. Lol. I appreciated the amount of cheese, it was tasty. The milkshake was way too sweet for me, which I should've anticipated but I was feeling particularly gluttonous so I had to complete the trifecta.

They keep this place clean, there were two employees cleaning up around the tables when I ate. People were nice and although it wasn't fast (speedy) food, I enjoyed it. I'd upgrade to two hot dogs and a large fries with the cheese next time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.. Confusion ordering and and unhelpful staff.. Ordered 2 splits (onion rings and fries).. Asked for ranch after I paid 80 something cents.. Then was waiting on one of the splits because she gave it to another customer who was still waiting for their whole meal and was like I didn't charge u.. I paid for the 3rd time.. Chili had no beans as advertised so maybe they have 2 different ones? Who knows.. It came to 22 something before another 4 bucks for the ranch and ties/onion rings.. If u want to prove high make sure ur service matches"}
{"text":"We live just across the street from Ted's, we always wanted to try it out, finally did today! 
The line was so long, waited at least 10/15 minutes.. My boyfriend and I got a foot long with onion rings on top, fries on the side and a drink (total of $10!!) By the way, the onion rings are made fresh daily, very good. We got some sauerkraut on the side (since I don't like it that much) and it was not good. However, the sausage was perfectly cooked and grilled! 
Maybe next time we will try to go there when it is not lunch time!"}
{"text":"Not sure that I'm one to conform to all the hype on this place. I checked it out because it's close to my work and had a bunch of good reviews, but I won't be adding to those. 

Right from the get go I was a little let down. There was a line that was fairly long, not outrageous but fairly long. It took a full 25 minutes just to get to the front of the line. Perhaps my bitterness carried over to the food, but I was not very impressed at all. I had a chili cheese dog that barely even rivals a dog from QT. The fries were very bland, pretty much no flavor, and I still spent almost 9 bucks."}
{"text":"Randomly yelps nearby hot dogs and discovered Ted's. This place is amazing, I have been back here several times and each time never seizes to amaze me! The staff is great, food is bomb!"}
{"text":"They closed for a while and did a nice job at updating the inside. It looks brighter and cleaner. But I must say they still have the worst most pissed off looking workers ever. They all just stare at you with a look of F U in their eyes. The way you order is weird. No one knows where to line up and it causes issues. You order. When your dog is ready you have to work your way back through all the people standing in line or shout at them what you want. Ice machine was empty and they looked mad I told them so. I don't get the love of this place. My meal was 10 and honestly not worth the headache."}
{"text":"The food was not bad...but the customer service desires room for improvement..the gentleman that has been here forever that does the toppings was obviously having a not so great day or was tired or something...no eye contact or acknowledgement when it was my turn to be asked what i wanted on my dogs and burger...wasn't sure if he heard me or if he was being a jerk intentionally....when i got my food my wife made a comment that she was uncomfortable also....so it wasn't just me....customer service is what brings people back...not chase them away...there were plenty of restuarants to choose from and we chose Ted's..."}
{"text":"Great? No come on! Thats good but not great. I don't know why, but when this much reputation and rating don't seem fair to me!
Overall it was a mediocre hotdog place."}
{"text":"Cook line is slow. Another Yelper said it best. \"Good food but run like a kids lemonade stand.\" Management, you make people wait unnecessarily. Food is good and hot. Try waiting in your own line and you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"Mediocre hot dog and over priced imo.  Tastes like something you would get in your backyard on the grill, nothing special, no joke.

The best part?  The stomach gas 6 hrs later was unbelievable.  You want a hotdog that's priced right just go to QT, Circle K, any convenience store with the roller grills.  Most won't give you the gas I experienced."}
{"text":"After getting tired of waiting for a table at a local breakfast joint, my husband and I decided to jet and go some place else.  What better way to start the day than with hot dogs!

The place was busier than I had expected at 11am, but not to the point where there was no place to sit.  It seemed to get busier as we were waiting in line to order.  

Everything is cooked right in front of you on a charcoal grill (with real flames and everything, folks - no simulated grilling).  You order what you want, it is cooked, and then you are asked what you want on it, sort of like a Qdoba setup.

My husband ordered the footlong with mustard, ketchup, onion, and pickles, a side of onion rings, and a chocolate shake.  I decided to go for the mac and bacon dog, a small fry, and a chocolate malt.  Our total came to $21, which may seem like a lot for hot dogs, but the amount of food we ended up with was pretty intense.  Most places that I've gotten onion rings at seem to go light on how many they give you.  At this place we could have forfeited the side of fries and still had extra onion rings left over.  A plus for us was that they were beer battered rather than breaded.  The fries looked to be freshly cut as they had skin on the ends, but they were pretty average.  My husband's footlong was topped with a generous amount of the requested toppings, including two full pickle spears.  My mac and bacon dog was loaded with macaroni and cheese, onion, and two strips of bacon.  They grill the bacon instead of frying it, which gives it a really good flavor.

My chocolate malt seemed a little more melted than I would have preferred, but I think some of that has to do with it being put into a paper cup and this being Arizona in August.

The only weird thing that I observed here was that none of the employees seemed to be in a very good mood.  They were pleasant enough, never rude, but none of them cracked a smile even once.  It didn't seem like any of them were particularly happy about being there.

Overall though it was a good experience, the food was tasty, and it was quick."}
{"text":"hot dog was very very good.
didnt care for the italian sausage at  all.
hamburger was pretty good.
If i go back, it will be hot dogs and id try the bratwurst.
the cook is very good but the girls dressing the food and the one getting the drinks dont have a clue whats going on. i almost took a star away becuz of them"}
{"text":"Must stop place when we come visit AZ. Tasty hot dog and yummy cheese fries. Line hasn't been too long and they have fast service. Place never disappoints."}
{"text":"This place is a must for the true Buffalo (the City) style hotdog lover, plain simple, yet satisfying.  But be prepared, this place does not do any other Transaction besides hard earned Cash!!

BTW there is an BofA ATM machine a stone thow away."}
{"text":"Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.

\"Hey! What do you want?\"

Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about."}
{"text":"YUM! I got a hot dog with Mac and cheese on top, so good! And my boyfriend got relish, catsup, mustard, the usual on his. We both thoroughly enjoyed the hot dogs as well as the french fries so much! 
However any of the packaged food like the potato salad we got was small, overpriced, and bleh. Just buy at the grocery store. 
And be prepared for a wait. They make it as you order, but there is always a looong line!"}
{"text":"Was amazed to find out that Ted's had more than just hot dogs! Now I have lived in the neighborhood for 20+years and never once went inside. Hot Dogs remember?? Ewwwww but to my surprise they also had hamburgers, chicken and salad! And some of the best onion rings I have ever had! Kicking myself for not going there all these years for a real good hamburger!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Ted's!  I'm in Tempe once or twice a week (at least) and I'll usually have lunch at Ted's.  They easily have the best hot dogs in the east valley.  There's always a line for lunch (depending on when you go--there have been times there wasn't a line when I walked in) and it can run the length of the building and out the side door.  Whatever your wait, it'll be worth it.  I stick with the all-beer hot dog or the foot- long dog with mustard, chili and cheese, a side of fries and a large drink and they get $9 from me--and I happily hand it over."}
{"text":"Being from Western NY, this is how I like my hot dogs... sliced and grilled.
The white hot was a disappointment, but I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Teds Hot Dogs has been a Tempe staple for years And I've always left there happy They recently updated their menu a little and with the addition of bacon I really can't  complain at all It's all about that char on the dog that you just don't get most places"}
{"text":"Simply the best dog in the East Valley. 

I've been frequenting Ted's since for many years and the quality has never changed. Open flame grill- the food cooks as you order. The all-beef dogs are amazing- and imported from New York, where the restaurant originated. There are other options such as white hots, hamburgers, foot longs, and brats. The french fries are good the onion rings are great. Ted's serves Pepsi products and accepts cash or credit card. The prices are very reasonable. The interior is decked in sports fare- and there's decent patio space available for outdoor dining (perfect during Spring weather). Expect crowds, especially around lunch time on weekends! Lots of out-of-state visitors here, and many spring training baseball fans (relatively close to Diablo stadium where the Angels play). 

If you're in the mood for a locally legend hot dog, cooked to perfection then head on over to Ted's Dogs. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really great hot dog joint with tons of choices.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Family owned since 1927 in Buffalo New York they have several locations in the Buffalo area and the only out of state is in Tempe Arizona for 32 years. The hotdogs are imported from Buffalo New York they're called Salens, they also have Polish dog white hots (which is a combination of pork and veal), Italian sausage hamburgers french fries and onion rings and handmade shakes the loganberries delicious. There was a long line but the really fast all the dogs and burgers are char grill over an open flame. The grill master cool take your order on how many dogs next person will ask it what you want on it, you're hot dogs are made until you order it so you can watch the whole process, I ordered mustard chili and onions absolutely delicious my has been ordered mustard pickles and onions will ordered french fries, they have many different sauces for your fries we have the mall vinegar. Logan berry shake was perfect very thick, It just a good old-fashioned shake. Since the owners are from Buffalo New York,you'll see a lot of Western New York memorabilia. My husbands from Buffalo so having these hotdogs was very nostalgic for him. Great place to take the family."}
{"text":"hadn't been here in years, and finally got to introduce my wife to it! great prices, food is perfect, they get it!

can be a bit of a hassle when its super busy, but hey, thats how things go. wish it was closer to home because i could eat this multiple times a week"}
{"text":"I and the family love hotdogs. Especially chili dogs. When we heard about this place and read some of the great reviews, we were so eager to try it. Especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well. We currently live in Maricopa, AZ about 35 min drive from Ted's so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive. We were disappointed. We ordered 8 of the regular dogs, I had chili, mustard, and onions on mine. The wife and kids had just ketchup. We also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake. The dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked. I love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside. But the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor. Very bland. Not even salt. My chili sauce was the worst I have ever had. It tasted more like tomato paste that I use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce. The onion \"rings\" were more like \"fragments\" with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor. Very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something. The milk shake was OK flavor, but was in like a 6 oz cup or something. Seemed way overpriced as everything else. I could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime. And it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good. The place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business. But we will not be back. Oh, also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint. Total cost for 8 dogs, a powerade, strawberry shake and the order of onion \"fragments\" was almost $37! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I had 2 regular dogs and potato salad. The hot dogs were good, nice and charred on the outside. The potato salad was tasty. It seemed to be homemade. Overall an enjoyable meal. 

Last time I was here was several years ago. Not sure I like the remodeling job. But I came for the food, not the ambiance."}
{"text":"My experience was just \"ok.\"  The hot dog was cooked well but wasn't anything special. I was excited when I saw the onion rings but was let down by the taste. The ordering process was a little confusing because the line was formed to the left where I couldn't see the menu. Then after I had already paid they had to call me back up to clarify my order (they did this for all 5 orders around mine).  Overall it not a bad experience but it was a little disappointing as I have been meaning to try this place for years."}
{"text":"This place is the best hot dog joint around.  They have a large selection of dogs to choose from and they are all cooked over a wood burning grill.  I always leave satisfied.

You order and then stand around as the dog cooks, waiting until it's done to give your condiment order.  I could go without that part because people are just piled up and it makes it go a lot slower since you can't put an order in because 10 people in front of you are just standing waiting for their dogs to cook.  I think they should take the order, cash out, and then get the food cooked and delivered.  That is the only reason I removed a star.  

However, I'll stand around for a hot dog that good.  Sometimes they are too busy for me to wait around so I will do a drive-by but I usually stick to their less busy hours.  

The one other thing that has always irked me was how badly they assault that poor defenseless dog.  They cut that thing, and slice it as if it just insulted their mother.  Apparently it helps because it is delicious.  I just wish it didn't have to take such abuse prior to arriving in my mouth.  I am a big proponent of humane treatment, even after it has taken its form as food."}
{"text":"Who would've thought a hot dog place would be so good?!? Not me, that's for sure! This place is simply great - hotdogs are not just for baseball games anymore and there are so many options - not just hotdogs, there's something here for everyone! I will say, I was surprised to see the line so long on a Sunday afternoon but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My wife & I decided not to worry about the $$ and  had each a double bacon cheese and ring burger.... It was good meaning ok. Price was a bit to much but as I said we decided not tobramr And rave on the cost.. the only thing I really liked was the music ...brings me back to the 80s"}
{"text":"Long  line, but worth the wait.  My Italian dog was cooked right in front of me and was nice and hot! Love that they actually had spicy mustard. Fries were fresh but kind of bland.  

How could anyone complain about anything for a $5.50 meal and including tax.

Thumbs up and I will be back."}
{"text":"To be honest this place has grown on me since I first went.  The first time I didn't really think it was all that special, but I've become a convert.  I'm not really a fan of the footlong, but the all-beef and regulars are great.  I like that the dogs are made fresh on the grill and you pick the toppings.  I usually go with the chili and cheese which are both tasty on the dog.  Skip the fries and go straight for the O-rings.  They are the best!  

This place is almost always busy at lunch and you order while in line.  A tip: take a look at the menu and be ready to order before the line winds around.  The staff is quick and friendly.  If you like fresh hot dogs you'll enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Andrew C. and I got to see what the hype about Ted's Hot Dogs on Amurica's Birthday.

I'm not the biggest hot dog fan, but some things are worth checking out.

No surprise there was a line out the door! 

An employee took our order on a tablet and off we went to the grill, where they ask you what you want on your dogs.

Dude got the Jumbo All-Beef Dog, I ordered the Bratwurst with onions and peppers. 

Also got the 50/50 fries and onion ring mix, and a chocolate shake, because Amurica. 

We sat down with our food, and man were we in for a treat. 

The dog had that excellent snap on the casing, and was full of flavor.

For a gal who isn't someone to crave hot dogs, this was freakin' delicious and makes me wish I had ordered one.

While the Bratwurst was also tasty with that charcoaly goodness, I wish it had a little more flavor to it. The onions and peppers are a must-add if you order this. 

I could live without the fries, but those onions rings are a must-order. These are certainly not the dive bar, freezer aisle onion rings I've come to expect. 

Those onions were enveloped in a perfectly crisp batter which held together nicely. Dip them in ranch for the full \"superheavyweight in a middleweight's body experience\", which I did! 

As for the chocolate shake, this wasn't one of those lame fast food, syrupy, not real ice cream shakes. After two weeks of being very sick and not eating, I was practically fighting Dude like a five year old over this! 

Rich, REAL ice cream. You can't say that for many places anymore these days. 

Next time I get the odd craving for meat in tube form, I'll hoof it over to Ted's!"}
{"text":"After reading help reviews,  I thought we'd have to try it.  Ugh..I wish we hadn't.  The service was so so... the food was ehhhh... the only things worth mentioning were the shake and the riot beer float"}
{"text":"OMG wtF 35 dollars for hot dogs, and they wanted 5 more for the chili! 
It gave me the runs and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for the first time on Sunday and was quite surprised. There was a huge line and there is a reason why. The hot dogs are delish and the fries are super awesome with either the cheese sauce or the malt vinegar mixed with ketchup... YUMMOH!  We will be back to try the shakes, burgers and onion rings!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs dont get much better than this. The chili cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"We always go to Ted's before the ASU Game.  I love the atmosphere!  It's more about that than just the food.  Although the hot dogs, bratwurst, and Italian sausage cooked on the grill are terrific.  I love the onion rings, too."}
{"text":"My family went to Ted's this weekend. We have been avoiding it because we dislike cash only establishments, unfortunately we can now avoid it because we don't much care for Ted's. 

I am from Upstate NY and I definately want to support bringing culturally pleasing (to me) food out to the desert. Knowing Ted's is from \"back home\" (since 1929), this encouraged me to break with our no cash only policy, besides I had to know if their hot dogs were better than the ones I import from Rochester to Arizona a few times a  year. It's expensive to bring Zweigles (since 1880) to Arizona and if there is a local replacement I was ready to find out.

First the ordering of our food was confusing. The person on the grill heard the first two items and then started talking to others in line to take their orders and I wasn't done yet. It wasn't like I paused, it was like he just heard all he wanted from me and moved on. I had to interrupt the ordering going on after me and say, Hey! I'm not done yet. This annoyed him, obviously. But I couldn't believe it when I started to order the rest, It didn't seem like he was paying any attention becuase mid sentance he started talking cheese with the people in front of me!  Ahem... we need two white hots, two footlongs, two corn dogs, three medium logenberry's, a chocolate shake and an onion ring please...

Next thing I know we are at the condiment section and the guy is putting stuff on my dogs I haven't even told him yet what I want on them!  Excuse me, I want to put Weber's mustard on that white hot. The grill guy yells over to me, \"We don't use Weber's, if you don't want yellow you can pump out the spicy mustard over by the straw station.\" 

They don't use the mustard they are advertising in the window? They don't have the spicy mustard at their own condiment station? In the meantime the register girl has already totalled my order and my order hasn't even been made yet, so of course it's not correct. I said, it's not all here yet. This puzzled her. I said I am still waiitng for the corn dogs, the drinks , the onion rings and the chocolate shake. She started over and came up with a second total, also wrong. The shake came in a tiny size, they said they are one size only. Who knew.  The register girl screwed up the change as well. Good thing I didn't just swipe a card and get screwed not paying attention.

We got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation. Since the toppings were not done right and the onion rings were very undercooked and a gnarled mess I was really hoping the white hot dogs flavor would kick ass. This was my main reason for coming. It was a decent dog, but it was not better than the ones I have shipped in to my house.  Amazingly enough the best tasting of the dogs we bought were the corndogs! What a surprise. But not worth driving out to Ted's and having cash ready for them. As for the shake, it rivaled McDonalds to me and I'd be happier getting a mondo size Chocolate Peanut Butter delight from Lenny's.

So for atmosphere, service, food and cost it just doesn't rate more than the two stars I gave it. Looks like I haven't found a way to replace my multi year shipment for back east brats, dogs, etc. with a local alternative. Sorry Ted's."}
{"text":"There is a restaurant in the Seattle, WA. area called Dick's Drive-in.

Ted's reminds me of Dick's, because they offer greasy, standard fare at an affordable price.

I expected the food to be better, but wasn't too disappointed.  Ted's doesn't mess around with fancy fixins' or strange combinations.

I assumed their motto to be: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"

You can screw up a hot dog if you over-think it, but Ted's has stayed true to the tradition.

On second thought, I bet their motto is: \"Keep it simple, stupid.\"

Also, their onion rings are pretty damn good: slim, flaky crust, with a sweet tasting onion."}
{"text":"Kids didn't want to eat the poke bowl so they ordered from here.  I have eaten here a couple times for lunch.

The hot dogs are good. Their specialty is that it is grilled right in front of you. You have a choice of several toppings like cheese and bacon and the normal ketchup and mustard.  They offer burgers, fries, and onion rings which I think are pretty good.

The regular dogs are pretty large but you can order the foot longs if you are hungry.  There are also other dogs that you can order if you don't want the beef dog.

Prices are a little high for hot dogs but go ahead and check it out."}
{"text":"5 stars. 
I have been going to place years. They had me at the charcoal grill. I get a hotdog with cheese, bacon and a pickle. I grew up on eating Martinos hotdogs on the southside of Milwaukee. 
The only thing that could possible make this place better is a shorter line. They have even adopted the Ipad ordering system to help curb the line at lunch time. Always polite and always great food."}
{"text":"Very yummy, very quick, great customer service. Fast food done right."}
{"text":"How awesome is this place!? I don't even like hot dogs, but I love getting them from Ted's! Have had foot longs, all beef, white hot.... Its all delicious. My daughter always gets the kids skinny dog with cheese sauce, and I love the onion rings!  I go out of my way to visit Ted's."}
{"text":"I really can't believe people love this place. The service is good. But the food is so bland. I had a foot long chilli cheese dog...blech."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I've had in AZ. The flavor on the all beef is amazing. Also, the batter they use on the onion rings makes the taste unbelievable. This place is very busy and great food is the reason. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Ted's still delivers consistently some of the best hot dogs around. The long lines at lunch time definitely reflect this! They offer credit card now, which is much appreciated in this day and age where paying with plastic is king. 

Whether it's a foot-long, bratwurst, or white hot, your meat in tubed form is consistently cooked with that nice char-grilled flavor. There are a plethora of toppings to choose from, and they now have mac and cheese as a side (Or even topping!) in addition to fries and their heavenly onion rings. 

Their milkshakes are still quite tasty, thick and rich. This is still the only place I know of to get a loganberry shake!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for comfort food, this is the place to be. I came here the other night and had a pretty damn good hot dog covered in chili and cheese. The chili was sweet and delicious, and the shakes are tasty.

I got a split (half french fries, half onion rings,) and while the fries were pretty good I just wasn't too crazy about the onion rings. They taste kind of like a bloomin' onion, but something was missing.

My advice would be if you're coming here, don't worry about the sides and indulge yourself in some delicious hot doggy goodness. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food!  I got a polish dog and fries and pleased my mouth with grilled goodness!  They have plenty of toppings you can add and the workers were all friendly.  I would have loved to leave a 5 star review but I think the food is a little overpriced.   That being said,  I will definitely be coming back.  It just won't be a frequent thing for me."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in about two years and remembered that it was good so we went back. The place has gone downhill. They used to staff the place appropriately to keep the line moving but now it's excruciatingly slow. Ordered a Chicago style, asked if they knew how to make it and they said yes. They did not. The hot dog was literally half the size of the bun and it had hot sauce on it. I, at first, mistook it for ketchup and took it back. When they said it was hot sauce I asked why they put hot sauce on my hot dog and they just stared blankly. Husbands burger resembled a tiny hockey puck. They seem to clearly be cutting corners on staffing, ingredients, and training and it shows."}
{"text":"Oh the food here is glorious....even if they serve mostly hot dogs and fries.   I love how they cook your order right in front of you on a grill.   They have onion rings that look like a hay stack and they are really good.  We love to go here to eat."}
{"text":"YUMMMMY.
Nothing on earth beats a good, char cooked hot dog and Ted's does this perfectly. I love getting a dog, corn dog and fries and pigging out- add some melted cheese sauce and you are really in business! 

Love this place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a dog then this is the place. Authentic hot dogs made famous in Buffalo ,NY This place has a regular crew who can make them in good time. Today is customer appreciation day and they're $.91 for regular hotdogs. The line goes out the doors! Worth the wait though"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Hotdogs are really good and you can dress them up however you want. The bacon cheese was not great because the bacon was not cooked right. But the chili cheese dog was awesome."}
{"text":"Ted's is one of the few hot dog joints where the hot dogs actually are better than the pricier sausages. But don't get me wrong, everything they serve is good. I first had Ted's when I was 8 years old, and it remains my favorite dog in Arizona. Every weiner is perfectly charred over coals. And the onion rings are battered and wonderful, more like an Awesome Blossom than breaded, frozen fast food rings."}
{"text":"You'll always be satisfied with the quality of Ted's food and services.  Their menu is simple, and they grill everything right in front of you to your liking.  I recommend ordering one of their famous hot dogs, but their burgers are just as delicious.  And the next time you find yourself at Ted's, do yourself a favor and order their made-from-scratch onion rings.  They're hands-down the best in town!"}
{"text":"We just heard about Ted's from a friend, I'm really glad that we did. When we walked in, there was a pretty long line, which to me meant that we were in for a treat. I had the Bratwurst Dog, my wife had the all beef. We are both used to Chicago Style Dogs, these are very different. The way they are cooked on the grill, the way they are poked at by the cook, I really enjoyed it. 

Try the onion rings, we liked those as well. 

It has a very unique vibe, we will be back."}
{"text":"Just delicious food and great service. Can't complain about getting a hotdog that's gourmet style and fast with taste!!!"}
{"text":"It's not too shabby. Better than most places I've been, especially since they cook their hotdogs over charcoal and I love a good charcoal broiled hotdog every now and then. The chili was a little sweet and tasted a little more like a meaty spaghetti sauce than a chili than I prefer, but it wasn't so bad that I wasn't able to enjoy and finish my meal. When you get onion rings, it's a huge quantity of them. I couldn't finish them myself.

It's no Portillo's, but all in all, not too bad."}
{"text":"I feel like this is a blasphemous review, but these hot dogs are no more remarkable than what I can whip together at home. My bf and I had dinner here last night, and I had been here once before about 4 years ago. I had the all beef dog with ketchup and onions with onion rings, my bf had bratwurst and french fries, and we split a strawberry shake. The front of the counter is a little unorganized, and I can only imagine what it's like when it's busy, but the staff was nice and accurate. My bf loves this place, but the best thing about my experience was the shake."}
{"text":"I have went here twice & ordered onion rings & bratwurst w/ sauerkraut on the side & it was all good & the servers there were awesome & patient!!! My kids even loved it!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great the only reason they don't get 5 starts is because the ordering procedure is weird (similar to the soup Nazi on Seinfeld) and the workers seem grumpy.  If I am going to overpay for a hot dog I at least want a smile when you take my money.  They charbroil their dogs here you just can't get that flavor anywhere else."}
{"text":"Whenever I stop by for lunch, there's always a line.  And you know what long lines mean: delicious, fresh food.  If the line is long (so, closer to the main door), the wait can be about 15-20 minutes, and plenty of time to change your mind from wanting a Brat, or maybe an Italian sounds better, or maybe the White Hot, nah I think I'll try a Sea Dog, or Polish?  No, Italian, yes, an Italian with fries and onion rings?  Just onion rings.  I'm indecisive, if you couldn't tell.  Their most recent addition has been to add mac and cheese on your freshly grilled, and perfectly burnt (in a good way!) hot dog, for an extra 75 cents.  This and chilli, is the most amazing thing ever.  And don't forget to get some cheese on the side!  I might have to start attending cheese-aholic meetings, for the sake of my cholesterol (no, I refuse to see exercise as an option here).

Cut to the chase:  My favorite things about this place, the perfectly grilled hot dogs, great choice of toppings (only the cheese, mac and cheese, and chilli are an extra charge), and those Teddy Bars look so good!  Though I've yet to try one.  My only complaint is the wait, but I've noticed that Ted's isn't so busy at dinner.  I hope I didn't just jinx that"}
{"text":"This place was okay, but once was enough. The meat was good quality and the concept is fun however I strongly believe that if you are going to advertise something you better make it good and I have had better chili out of can! The chili they put on my dog lacked meat and flavor. In fact it tasted more like glorified ketchup. It might sound petty but that's how I feel. I can make a better chili dog at home and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty much all of my friends that went here said it's a super delicious restaurant. After eating here, I agree with them. It is super delicious and I'd come back whenever I'm craving hot dogs, even though I ordered the bratwurst. It was not a hot dog, but I was satisfied with the taste. The sausage was cooked to perfection and the bun was soft and the peppers and onion had just enough of a sweet taste to where it did not subtract from the sausage. Great place to get a hot dog or similar. The fries were average like any other place, but they do give you a lot.

If you ever see this place, stop by and don't drive past. It's worth it."}
{"text":"A definite 4-star experience.  Didn't visit Portillo's, but was sold on the charcoal grilling done at Ted's.  All the dogs, brats and sausages available with all the fixin's you could ever want.  The grilling makes the line move kinda slowly, but it's worth the wait.  Go and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I do not get to Ted's often enough.  Been going there for 20 years, Today had the polish with all the fixins and the greatest onion rings in the Valley.  Teds is a Tempe staple.  If you have not been there, you need to get there soon."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place if I ever need a hot dog fix. I haven't tried the burgers, but the dogs are inexpensive, cooked over hardwood charcoal, and just plain delicious.

I think they could improve the buns that they use. I live very, very close by, but I don't come as often because the buns just don't do it for me. Growing up around Chicago, I've become very partial to the type of buns they use at Portillo's or at Hot Doug's.

Plenty of patio tables and lots of seating inside. This place is good for groups, a pair, or just by yourself but I wouldn't really call it a date spot."}
{"text":"Be prepared for long line but worth the wait.  Foot long chilly dog with small hot dog and fries.  Great stop before ASU sporting event like wrestling today. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I thought this place was kind of gross, i had the white and hot brat( the one with the wierd name) and the onlion rings and my friend had sauerkraut brat but had to go back to ask for sauerkraut and since she was german she thought maybe they were retarded for not puttin it on. I dont care for kraut so I dont know about that...my brat was tasty but the onion rings i was sorry i wasted my money on, tney were sort of doughy and really didnt have that good fried up taste i usually adore onion rings but I just didnt think this place was any big deal. I wanted to try it since its popular and I may go back to try a regular hot dog or a chili dog just since it advertises good meat and Ive never had any other hot dog except store ones and of course at the fair. I think this is more of a guy's place since a guy would actually consider a good hot dog a real meal. Its always crowded (with guys) and you always have to plan on waiting a good 20 minutes, plan ahead."}
{"text":"If you're looking for charbroiled grilled hot dogs than this is the place for you.  They have a good selection including a great white hot dog.  They have a good corned dog and a bunch of toppings to choose from.  I've been coming here since I was a little kid and the quality has been great for as long as I can remember.  This is definitely a place I recommend to people looking for a hot dog place."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are very good! Burgers are good! 
Onion rings and fries are unsalted, soft/chewy/hard, not crispy and nice! 

Pretty pricey, $30 for 3 dogs a cheeseburger and a chicken sandwich. 
Highly recommend if you want a nice hotdog. I eat a lot and 2 jumbo dogs filled me up"}
{"text":"Update: When I submitted a review to the manager of Ted's about our horrible experience, they were extremely responsive and nice about it, which I really appreciated. They offered a gift card to give them another chance, and we accepted. We just went in again today, and it was a much more pleasant experience. The workers were nice, but not overly friendly, which is perfectly fine with me. They smiled and took the order respectfully, and the entire order was complete and correct the first time. The food was yummy and we got it decently quickly. I noticed that the had a new sign that clarified the sauce options, which was not there before, and I suspect my complaint may have been the reason for that. I am boosting the review to a 3 instead of a 1 because of this. I would make it a 3.5 if I could. We still have money on the gift card, so when I go back again I may raise the stars again. I'm not sure if it was just an improvement in training or if the workers are just nicer during lunch hours (when there aren't high school kids working?). Either way, it felt just like a nice, normal experience instead of being treated horribly, and that was a HUGE improvement to me."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, delicious comfort foods. And I love that every time I go there I can get something different because there are so many options. I love the bratwurst and traditional hotdog. The homemade chili is great. The fries are fresh and they go great with hot cheese sauce. There are plenty of condiments to choose from and the grilled peppers and onions are fresh. They also use high-quality sauerkraut. We also have a picky eater in the family so I appreciate that Ted's has a skinless hotdog. 

I appreciate the ambiance as well. It has a very authentic New York feel. And even when there is a huge line the staff is very efficient and moves through the orders quickly. You would think this may cause some mistakes but we've never had a mistake with our order, which is even more impressive considering we usually have all kinds of specialty requests and directions. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I lived in Buffalo NY until 4 years old. Then moved to Scottsdale, AZ. My father turned me on to Ted's back in the 90's. He used to go to original Ted's in NY.  I've been hooked ever since. I moved to California in 1988. Every time I go back to Scottsdale my FIRST stop is Ted's. I've even called my host and said \"I will be at your place in an hour. I have to get my Ted's fix!!\" I will be back in Scottsdale next May, and again, my first stop will be Ted's. I keep searching, but haven't yet found a chili cheese dog as good. It's the charbroiling and the homemade relish. Rock on Ted's!!! C ya May 2010!

{"text":"Well, I'm not from Tempe or the Desert or Buffalo at all and I LOVE TED'S! I've lived and traveled all across our country, Canada and Mexico and the dog's at Ted's are about the best. Coming a close 2nd is the Texas Hot Lunch in Hanover, Pennsyltucky near Gettysburg. Cooked over a flame right in front of you, I usually get a All Beef  (or 2) with chili & cheese and crispy fries made the same way. Their chili is so tasty, it makes you want to send to a chemist to get the recipe. The rush's run at different times, too, so be prepared to wait for your dog, it's worth it. Oh, and as mentioned, bring cash, although there is a Bank of America ATM in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"My favorite hotdog place.   Most hotdogs at restaurants are awful.   Teds rocks.

It is not cheapest place, but its worth it.

The fries are not good, but I don't care.

The hotdogs are great.  Period.   End of story.

Many places have gone to \"super size\" dogs that use huge, bland wieners with no taste and cheap meat.   Ted's serves the classic size dog, with just the right balance of dog, bun, and toppings.

I don't eat there often.    But it is on top of my list."}
{"text":"What is there not to like about this place?!?

Fresh food. Hardy American junk food. And cooked to order right where you can see it!

Value is there, Staff is FRIENDLY. Love the options and the speed of service!

So far away : ("}
{"text":"I had an italian sausage with onions and peppers. Because I was starving, I'd say it was A-OK. Otherwise, it was pretty much a Costco sausage thrown on a charcoal grill, with onions and peppers. Which would be pretty good, actually...plus cheaper and less of a wait. It was good, but edging out Pink's? No way."}
{"text":"You can't beat hamburgers and hotdogs cooked on a charcoal grill!  I would have given it 5 stars if only they had fresh ground beef patties instead of frozen, but it was still delicious! Can't wait to go back and try a hotdog next time!"}
{"text":"I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds.  I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  

Sometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but \"Hey you're on vacation!\"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.

So what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  

They have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.

The onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-Q"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Being from New England I expect a hot dog joint to carry a large variety of dogs and buns. This place was just like any other. Here are my disappointments.

1. No New England style buns. They didn't even know what they are and the cook looked at me funny. To me this is insane, the bun is the second most important part next to the type of hot dog. A cheap potato bun doesn't cut it.

2. I asked for my bun to be buttered and toasted, again they were unable to do this and looked at me funny again.

3. I wanted my dog boiled and charred, again they don't do this. I am okay with boiled dogs and would have gone that route but they didn't even offer them boiled! Head scratcher on that one.

4. The only natural casing dog they carried came as a foot long. I did order this and it was good. I wish they carried natural casing dogs in regular size as I was not too happy with the price of having to order a foot long.

5. Service was slow, not friendly and they seemed rather irritated I asked question. Also ordering was confusing with all the people behind the counter you would think someone would want to take my order. They must not be that hungry for money.

On one positive I did enjoy the onion rings. They kind of reminded me of the ones served at Wahlburgers in Hingham Ma.

Any case, if you are from New England be prepared to be disappointed. I had high hopes seeing this was a franchise from New York, but then again New York is not part of New England.

Late,"}
{"text":"If you want a Hot Dog in Phoenix this is where you go hands down in my opinion. The char grill dogs and the onion rings will definitely be the highlight of your day."}
{"text":"For some reason I have been craving a hotdog. I don't know why, all I know is that I really wanted one. The guys working here were very nice and the service was fast. The hotdogs are cooked to order so it is a bit of a wait but nothing more than 10 minutes. The hotdog doesn't come with a combo so you kind of get nickle and dimed. It's fine since i really did want fries and a drink. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that I didn't want more of! The BEST onion rings, hands down. I've yet to take a friend here who didn't love it."}
{"text":"On my way to the Airport, I decided to stop at Ted's for a bite to eat.  Being that I live really close to this place, and have never tried it before, I thought this would be a prime time to check this place out.

Well, it was alright.  Nothing special on the interior, and even though I was not blown away by my experience here, I really did enjoy myself.  We waited in line, and I ordered a jumbo beef hot dog, with Chili.  Austin got a sausage, with some of the fixings, and fries.  We both liked it, and I plan on returning again soon.  Pretty good!"}
{"text":"According to my son...\"great hotdogs, definitely eat There! If you don't, I feel sorry for you.\""}
{"text":"Hot Dogs don't get any better than when you get them at Ted's Dogs! They really know how to make them there. Plus they make so much more there...they have the Sea Dog, corn dogs, foot longs, hamburgers, French fries and their onion rings are delicious! I can order anything off their menu and not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ted's is a staple in this part of the Valley and especially with the upstate New York folks. They char grill everything on the menu (including the bacon) and they do it right in front of you. They have decent fries (better with the cheddar cheese) and above average onion rings. 

The service is better than average for a fast food place (avoid if you are in a hurry because nothing is fast at Ted's) and they have just remodeled recently. The place looks pretty good on the inside but nothing spectacular. There is ample parking since they are located in a strip mall.

They are pricey in my opinion but almost all the places in the Valley that specialize in hot dogs are for some reason.

I've been coming here for over 15 years and there is almost always a HUGE line to order your food. I liked their food better back in the day. I'm not sure if they changed something or it's just me. At the end of the day I want to really like Ted's and support them but the food just isn't good enough in my opinion to wait in those long lines!

In a nutshell:

Buffalo folks like Ted's 
Detroit folks like Detroit Coney
Chicago folks like Portillo's & The Chicago Hamburger Company

It's hard to be receptive to different styles of cooking or different meats when you have gotten used to your food a certain way or style. Ted's uses Sahlen Meats for their dogs and I prefer Vienna Beef.

One last thing, the Loganberry drink they offer is pretty good! Never had anything like that anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have been a going to Ted's since 1999 when I moved to AZ and absolutely love the all beef hotdog and the burgers are juicy and delicious. Their malts are really thick and to die for. You might need a spoon or let it melt a little because they can be a little thick at times. Best hotdog restaurant I have come across in AZ, hands down."}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago 62 years.  Always had jobs outside for the most part which took me into every neighborhood in Chicago.  I have had the best, Vienna Hot Dogs, the king of hot dogs in the Windy City. Places that you wonder what was in the bun. Hundreds of hot dog joints since I was a kid.
This was my first visit to Teds, toying with the thought of continuing on to my beloved Portillo's .
But no, had to try Teds.   I was not disappointed. 
Was a GREAT DOG! Buffalo you gotta be proud of your Teds.   Had a regular with mustard, relish, onion, tomato and a pickle, a chili cheese dog.
Loved it."}

{"text":"A good old fashioned weiner, Yaaah Boy!
A grilled dog with all the fixing and a few more, at a decent price. That's plain good eatin. They got all sorts of stuff to eat. Burgers, mac and cheese, hand made shacks, fresh onion rings and ice cream to rattle off a few. Plenty of help with a good attitude. Have'ta love that.
Pass'n trough to...stop in."}
{"text":"Disappointed as I was told this was one of the BEST hot dogs ever.  We got an all beef and white hot.  Not the worse hot dogs we've had but not the best.  They do however have REALLY GOOD onion rings!"}
{"text":"Delish.

In the midst of my break (okay, lapse) from vegetarianism, I sought out this place for meaty delights.  When I want meat, I don't look for a steak--I want burgers and dogs, and Ted's did not disappoint.

With many dogs, the primary taste is from whatever condiments you put on the wiener.  With Ted's dogs, you get a smoky, slightly burnt taste of a REAL charcoal grilled frank that is enhanced by your custom toppings.

My tastes are simple and easy to please.  I like a foot long with just extra deli mustard--don't need more than that.  My wife likes more--mustard, ketchup, a little relish, and pickles.  Doesn't matter how you want it--Ted's will serve it up awesome.  Add fries and you've got a full meal for cheap.

Forget Circle K, and Wienerschnitzel can bite me.  Ted's has the dogz you're looking for."}
{"text":"If you have a hotdog or onion ring craving - this is the place.  The ordering process can be a bit of a new process, but in it's own way - adds to the whole fun \"Ted's\" experience.   Be prepared for long lines - been here numerous times and I have never witnessed a short line... take that as a good sign - great food.  Their foot longs and whitehots are great.  Onion Rings/fries with a side of cheese is a must."}
{"text":"Went to try their gluten-free roll. Of course the hot dogs are authentic and delicious. The roll is soft, warm and chewy. Sadly it is microwaved, not steamed. The charbroiled dogs and toppings were very tasty and definitely satisfied the craving for that authentic ball park frank, Chicago-style dog experience."}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area, I wanted to try something that Phoenix yelpers raved about and Ted's Hot Dogs appeared with a 4-5 star rating from 7 yelpers!  We were excited about a place that serves up hot dogs and warrants five stars!

Even though they sold burgers and sandwiches, you have to order some type of sausage or dog when that's what they are famed for.  My friend and I opted for the Polish Sausage ($3.25), the BF chose the Bratwurst ($3.29), and my other friend went for their Regular Hot Dog ($2.05).  I read about their fabulous milkshakes, so chose a Chocolate Shake ($3.05) and their amazing Onion Rings ($2.59).

I requested all the sausages and dogs to be loaded up with everything, which looked like it included onions, peppers, a pickle spear, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  I must admit, they did look a bit smaller than what I'm used to.  And the cashier couldn't tell the difference between the Polish Sausage and the Bratwurst.

In terms of the hot dog, my friend was not impressed. He said the hot dog itself tasted like any other hot dog, but he did like all the fixings on top.  The polish sausage tasted a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion.  You can see lots of spices and stuff in the polish sausage, but there wasn't enough kick for my tastes.

The chocolate milkshake was thick and made from real ice cream.  Their onion rings reminded me of an onion blossom because of their thin batter.  I wished they had a different kind of dipping sauce for it instead of ketchup.

Overall, my experience at Ted's Hot Dogs was just okay.  Maybe it's a locals thing and you have to be a true local to really appreciate their hot dogs and sausages.  I guess I just had a little more in mind.

Sidenote: Cash only

Total cost: Less than $19.00 (You can see the photo of everything we ordered in the business profile pics!)"}

Yeah, I might feel guilty and go to the gym after eating here, but I never feel like I just ate garbage. Fresh and made when you order it. Don't let the line scare you! They are quick and friendly."}

I give this long time Tempe establishment 2 thumbs up . I'm never disappointed and always leave feeling satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  

I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  

This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!"}

{"text":"Came here with some coworkers for lunch.  Was surprised at how busy it was, but it was a good sign the good was likely tasty!  I opted for the Italian sausage dog with mustard and chopped onions.  The dog had a good snap to it and was very flavorful.  Would have liked the mustard to have a little more kick, but it was good.  Also had a side of onion rings - overall, they were fresh but didn't have the crispness that I was expecting.  Very clean place and the line moves fast.  Will come back when I have a hot dog craving."}
{"text":"A chain of hot dog restaurants based in Buffalo, New York. Founded in 1927 by Greek immigrant Theodore Spiro Liaros. Leave it to a Greek to build a chain that yelps praise with their highest accolade.

I am lunching on Teds signature footlong, fries and a coke. 7.5  And as I'm standing there John Belushi comes in to my mind shouting \"cheeborger, cheeborger, cheeborger no pepsi coke.\"

Anyway they served up a delicious dog and fries today. Plus I got to read Teds hometown, Buffalo N.Y. newspaper. The Buffalo Bills are 2nd in the AFC East 4 wins 2 losses .667 3-0 at home 1-2 on the road.

Ted's is a must if you enjoy a charcoal grilled hot dog."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

You might wonder how this place gets the same star rating from me as Steak 44 given that it's a hot dog.  I don't compare the two to each other, I compare this place to other hot dog joints.  And this is a fine example.

I love the fact that this is the only outpost not in Upstate New York.  I love the fact that they char-grill their hot dogs.  I love the variety of sausages they have.  It's not the best hot dog I've ever had, but it is mighty tasty.

I typically opt for a bratwurst with mustard and sauerkraut, or an all beef (various toppings), or the white hot (perhaps their most underrated sausage.)  The casing is great.  Even with the mauling that they do on the grill with your dog, there is still a great snap when you bite into the hot dog, and the smokiness from the charcoal is perhaps the best part of the experience.

I am not as huge a fan of the onion rings as most people are.  I like the fact that it is mostly onion - I don't like how flimsy they get most times.  I am also not a fan, generally, of their fries.

I am a fan of their milkshakes.  It is, I believe, one of the best in the Valley.  Eminently sippable (unlike the solid hunk you get at In n Out), it tastes like a classic milkshake should - ice creamy without too much ice cream, good milk, well blended.

This place is close to the perfect hot dog, but it's not quire there yet.  But rest assured you should never be disappointed for coming to a hot dog joint like this."}
{"text":"Obviously there have been a lot of great reviews of Ted's here. And this is not one of them. I was not blown away by my hot dog with mustard, onions and relish. It was ok. Honestly, I have made better ones. The relish tasted like the stuff out of the jar and the hot dog's flavor was nothing spectacular.
Their fries are good, better than average. The onion rings are good, too, and better than average.
The place has a great feel to it. From the food counter where you order and see your food prepared, to where it is handed off and they put whatever you want on your hot dog, sauerkraut, mustard, relish, onions, etc., to the memorabilia on the wall and the awards from the mid-80's for best hot dog place.
But, I have to say, sorry Ted, it just wasn't that great. I would go back and eat there again, after all it wasn't bad. But I am not going to miss it if I don't make it back there ever again. There are plenty of places I have had a better dog, including Trader Joe's Fearless Franks grilled at home. Call me a hot dog snob, but Ted's just didn't cut the mustard."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. Wife and I were starving and couldn't decide so we ended up trying a regular dog, a brat, a white hot, and a cheese burger between us. Oh my god. They were all so good. The range of toppings was awesome, we felt like kids in a candy store. Rounded it out with a flight of sauces for the perfectly cooked fries. So good I'm getting emotional."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but what's most notable about this place is their staff. Very friendly and fun. If you're looking for a quick cheap bite, this is your jam!"}
{"text":"We waited in line for a long time but man was it worth it. The hot dog snap was pristine and it seemed as if the chili and cheese was made specifically to compliment my dog. The staff were friendly and my kids really enjoyed the corn dogs. The two things I enjoyed the most were the onion rings and the atmosphere. None of the meal would have been nearly as good without the old time feeling and watching my food cook in front of me on the grill. I will be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a laid back place to bring the young ones.  I often feel out of place when I take my kids to restaurants but not here. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Sooo yummy, a little high in price but it's worth it. The food is always fresh & fast. The decor makes me feel like I'm not in AZ anymore :)"}
{"text":"Your hotdog might take a bit, and it's nothing you can't do yourself on a grill, but this place is a cut above the rest in the hotdog arena. Not too expensive and you can pick all your options like subway or chipotle. A solid choice for a sub $5 quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for almost 10 years and they have always had a winning formula for their famous hot dogs and an easy meal. On work days, you need to get there before 11:30am or you'll be waiting an hour - they cook the sausages on a grill right in front of you - even though its sometimes 115 outside. Their home made shakes and onion rings are also a winner!"}
{"text":"Best Bratwursts and white hots I've had. All I put in my dogs are mustard, salsa, onions and a pickle. I order a side of onion rings and I'm enjoying the best hot dog meal in Arizona. I've also tried the regular beef franks, the footlongs, fries. They are all equally delicious. DO IT."}
{"text":"I grew up riding my bike as a kid to the location on Niagara Falls Blvd. When I moved to Phoenix I was so excited to make my first trip back since College to Ted's. It is a 25 min. drive to get there but soooooo worth it. There is no better Hot Dog on the planet anywhere!!!!"}
{"text":"As good as a hot dog gets! This place has been around a long time, and for good reason. Char-grilled top-quality meats right from Buffalo NY.

Must try the foot-long-dog (with tons of toppings) and the savory onion rings. The brat and the Italian sausage are also fantastic!

It can get pretty busy at lunch. I suggest visiting at slightly off-peak hours."}
{"text":"One of my favorites places to grab a delicious Cheeseburger and practically any type of hot dog. 
Don't be scared if there is a line it moves quickly and its well worth the wait!
Their milkshakes and cheese fries are pretty tasty aswell!"}
{"text":"Teds is the best place in town to go get a hot dog! It is cooked and prepared right in front of you, and the burgers are just as good."}
{"text":"I had the jumbo all beef dog and the half and half fries and onion rings. The dog was fine I guess, but the onion rings were kinda bland and crumby.  I think this place survives on nostalgia alone."}
{"text":"I love that they now offer GF buns! Their grilled dogs and brats are the BEST in Phoenix by far.  Love stopping here whenever I'm in Tempe. Cannot get grilled dogs like this anywhere else in the Valley, wish you had more locations. A dog just tastes better when grilled. For me the darker the better. Just a couple words of advice to the workers- use a knife to cut the GF hot dog buns instead of trying to use your gloved fingers, you'll have better results. Also just change gloves before handling my GF bun without asking me if I want you to :) I think most GF peeps would agree with me on this."}
{"text":"For me nothing beats a great hot dog and that what Ted's is all about. The charbroiled dogs there are the best in town and keep me coming back over and over. The onion rings also will knock your socks off if you're into fried tasty goodness. The burgers are legit too, but get a dog and you'll never forget it."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I really hate to do this because they are a small operation and I don't like to throw them under the bus. 

I had a kraut dog and a chili cheese dog. I thought they would be great considering they were charbroiled. Hot dogs are really best when grilled, right? Well, I would not prefer these over wienersnitzel. They didn't wow. 

The service was meh. I was jazzed and told them I have lived in the valley for 17 years and have driven by and always thought  I should try that place someday...I announced that today was the day and what should I have. They acted as though I was an idiot. They may be right but humor me and recommend something or at least make me glad I decided to visit. They were just like shrug, shrug, meh. 
Whatever, they're fine. Nothing special. I will probably drive by for another 17 years."}
{"text":"I've said this about Chicago vs. NY pizza and the same is true about Chicago vs east coast hot dogs.  To argue which is \"better\" is the same as arguing if a vacation is better in the mountains or the seashore.  WHY do people waste their time (and our time) trying to compare apples & oranges?  If you love your beloved regional favorite, why do you waste time, energy and money eating what you know you're going to hate, then waste our time rating it only a 1-star?  One such review on Yelp was one that listed their personal choice of what a Chicago hot dog is supposed to be like (while comparing it to a WNY hot dog) and \"screamed\" in ALL CAPS that for a real Chicago dog \"NO SUBSTITUTIONS ARE ALLOWED\".  Yeech.  Really?  You will only eat it the way somebody else tells you it should be eaten?  I can see why someone like that would rate Ted's 1-star.

Now welcome to Ted's in Tempe.  I'm proudly from Buffalo where Ted's was invented and still owns what a real hot dog should taste like.  I also lived in Chicago and ate those things called Chicago dogs that are boiled to the point of flavorlessness then covered with so much crap you have no idea what the hot dog tastes like.  When in Chicago, I ate as Chicagoans do and I didn't bitch and whine that their dogs didn't compare to what I was used to.  I ate them and I chose to order my own selection of condiments.

Ted's in Tempe?   Well, it is the only Ted's outside of the Buffalo, NY area, opened by Ted himself after his retirement.  Including the Tempe location they are a tiny family-owned group of Buffalo-area hot dog stands. They are absolutely true to what a real WNY hot dog tastes like and they don't wimp out and try to please the Midwesterners who wander in by mistake and think they can order a Chicago dog ... not gonna happen.

I don't have a favorite at Ted's. I am a sucker for White Hots (yeah I know, people outside of WNY have no idea what that is).  But my choice usually comes back to the footlong which is lovingly charbroiled (I know, people outside of WNY think you are a space alien if you charbroil a hot dog).  Unlike Chicagoans who were're advised like to be told how to eat a hot dog, Ted's has plenty of choices to make your dog personal.  I have my choice ... mustard, RED relish (no folks it's not hot sauce, it's a special relish unique to WNY, and it's also not chili, it's relish) and a pickle spear on the dog.  People who kill their dogs with a ton of crap should be reported to PETA ;-)

Ted's onion rings are the gold standard, and yes dang you, they are greasy like a good onion ring should be!  And I can't resist a large serving of loganberry pop (I'll wait while you Google what I mean by \"pop\").

People, Ted's is hot dog history and those of us who go to the Tempe location are lucky beyond words.  And (sorry if I offend anyone) but Ted's should not ever \"expand\" and franchise and open a location in Dubuque.  If you want the one and only you have to come to Tempe or go to Buffalo.  Otherwise, settle for what you can get elsewhere and wish you were at Ted's."}
{"text":"Ted's is a classic Tempe landmark. I grew up ni Tempe and this place always brings back great memories. The food is all made from scratch fresh each day. The staff is always friendly. Try the italian sausage and potato salad. Ted's never disappoints.

Get there by 11 for an early lunch or after 1pm to avoid the massive lines."}
{"text":"We eat at Ted's whenever we're in this part of town, which is a five-star review in itself. Brat, burger, onion rings and a malt! Fantastic!!! Ted's is always a treat, especially when there isn't a long line. No better dogs in town! The burgers are great as well, and the bacon!  Wow! Going there for lunch today."}
{"text":"Had Ted's for dinner this evening. Flew back from Minnesota this afternoon and wanted a hot dog real bad.
I had a foot long with chili, mustard and onions. The lady had polish with peppers and mustard. Small fries and a milkshake. Wow. Excellent choice, everything is made to order,great service. Will be coming back more often."}
{"text":"Went in and tried a hamburger, fries and hot dog. Nothing was bad but nothing was great either. I had high hopes for the hot dog because grilling is usually pretty awesome but nothing really stood out. It was like good stuff combined to make something kind of ordinary. That said, it's worth checking out if you want a hot dog and when you walk in it smells absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"My favorite hot dog of all time is the Ripper from Rutt's Hut in Clifton, New Jersey. Something about deep-frying a hot dog until it splits open, bursting forth with flavor and cholesterol, really does it for me.

In lieu of that, Ted's is a good quality hot dog place with unique, charbroiled-tasting hot dogs. They hail from Buffalo, New York and the line often wraps around the front area near the grill, where you shout out your order to the current grillmaster, similar to Chuckbox when it's busy.

The highlight is almost certainly their incredibly onion rings. They serve huge portions for decent prices and everything is always fresh and tasty. (Spent $8.15 for a large iced tea, all-beef hot dog, and onion rings.) The onion rings are more of a torn apart onion blossom than the traditional rings--an approach I much prefer. There are plenty of sides and toppings you can request as well, from cheese to chili to onions, 'kraut, ketchup, mustard, and all the other basics.

Overall a pleasant experience and a unique flavor. Worthwhile if you're looking for a damn good hot dog. (And they take credit cards now, after many years of holding out as cash only!)"}
{"text":"Grab yourself a white hot, or whatever other flame broiled tube steak that does it for you, and have a seat.  Wait, get some fries or rings with that.

Like a dinner and a show?  While you're waiting in line, you get to watch the grill masters at their culinary best.

I thought Buffalo NY was known for chicken wings and grain elevators, but apparently they know a thing or two about serving up and incredible meat-by-product encased in sheepskin (actually, I think its the small intestine of sheep).  So far, I haven't gotten any dogs which are ribbed (for my or anyone else's pleasure).

Come out and get a taste of Buffalo, because if you like hot dogs, then you'll love what Ted's has to offer.

-Swoop"}
{"text":"Bragged about Ted's to friends of mine.  NYE we arrive at  6:30.  Lights and neons are on, people sitting down to eat BUT doors are locked.  WTF???  Drove down from Shea and Scottsdale road, only to be closed so early.  Christmas Eve I can see, but New Years Eve???.  They must not need the business, so the six of us will make it a bit easier for them and but come back and not recommend them any longer.  We found plenty of places open on the way back up north.  Places that want the customers money."}
{"text":"Teds Hot Dogs is a fantastic place to eat hot dogs. You can go after a show, the theater, for lunch or dinner. The taste is charred into the dog. They have regulars, all beef, foot longs, bratwurst, and sausage. ALL are fantastic. They have a wide selection of toppings. Ketchup, mustard, relish, tomatoes, pickles, onions, kraut, chili, and cheese. I am sure I left some out. The restaurant looks like they transported it from up state New York. The fries are good but the onion rings are REALLY good. They have ice cream shakes and other drinks. They also have a unique Loganberry drink. I guess I am a novice of Loganberry, but it tasted like a grape juice fruit punch to me. 

If you go at the wrong time the lines will be long. It is worth the wait for sure. The lines are long because if you want a hot dog, this is the place to go. I highly recommend Teds to fans of char broiled Hot Dogs or Hot Dog lovers in general."}
{"text":"Had a brat with sauerkraut, grilled onions, all the condiments... best hot dog i've ever had.  I'm from socal and the closest thing i've had was Pink's hot dogs... and it can't even compare.

2nd dawg was the white hot which was equally delicious..
nothing like charcoal grilled hot dogs... drooling at my computer now"}
{"text":"A simple and inexpensive place with tasty hot dogs, corn dogs and hamburgers. All the ingredients are imported from Buffalo and upstate New York. It reminds me of barbeques in the backyard while growing up. Thanks Spiro for bringing some New York magic to Arizona. All that's missing is Genesee Cream Ale."}
{"text":"This is the only Ted's location outside of NY, so my friend was super excited to try it out. He'd grown up eating it, but it was my first time ever stepping into a Ted's and eating one of their dogs. It was everything my friend told me it would be.

I added mac and cheese to my dog and that made it so delicious. The onion rings were crunchy and flavorful. I would definitely come back here again. The loganberry drink is so good - not too sweet at all."}
{"text":"Two words: Loganberry Shake. That is the key to maximum enjoyment of your Ted's experience.

The hot dogs are good and perfectly burnt (you can of course order them other levels of done if you're a huge weirdo), the specialty sausages are amazing (try a white hot), and the fries are these cute not-quite-full-size cuts that are the ideal balance between crispy outside and mushy inside.

If you go to Ted's for a burger, you will be disappointed. They are not a burger joint.
If you go to Ted's for atmosphere... There's no hope for you. It's a hot dog joint.

If you go for meat wrapped in some form of tubing, you should not leave disappointed. Especially if you order the almighty loganberry shake.

Fries. Tube meat. Shake/soda. Stick to the basics and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating must have set my expectations too high. But in comparison to other hot dog places it's not all that great either. 

Better than the nasty chain weinerschnitzel, but not as good portillo's or coney's grill. 

I also tried the Mac and cheese which was kinda gross, especially since a box of Velveeta shells & cheese outshines it. 

The Fries are fine, service was very polite, pricing fair. But with so many choices for a hot dog in the area. Meh I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some Chicago style dogs. The price is a little steep for what you get. Also, don't expect fast service here, but that is understandable seeing as how they cook everything fresh. 

On a bad note, the last time I was in I ordered a brat and I asked for sauerkraut , BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a polish dog and fries and was not impressed by either, especially the fries. The cook asked me if I wanted fries and I said yes and when I got to the cashier and paid for my food, my food came out with a large fry. Apparently there are different sizes to the fries and no one bothered to check with me what size and charged me the largest. No big deal if the fries were delicious, but they were far from. The hotdog was just ok. I love the concept but wish they executed it better."}
{"text":"I have gone to Ted's many times now and each time I get the foot long hot dog with classic fixings. This time around I tried the double burger, it was good, a typical homemade style burger, but Ted's really shines with their hot dogs/bratwursts.  The onion rings are hand made and are the prefect form of flaky that the don't feel like I'm eating a pound of grease. The fries are delicious and when salted a little and paired with a rich, cold ketchup, you can't go wrong. The only downside is that the lines are really long everytime I have gone, but I guess thats what you have to deal with when everyone wants to eat at Ted's."}
{"text":"Another update...nothing has changed.

Started and ended my two day journey at Ted's.  First trip I got an Italian, a Bratwurst and an all beef dog.  Topped the sausages with mustard and onions and the all beef dog with mustard, onion, relish and hot sauce.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.   While I was eating, I overheard a conversation a few tables over.  This lady and man asked this group how they liked the food etc.  Turns out, the people asking the questions were one of Teds Grandaughters and the CEO of Teds.  Pretty cool stuff!

Second trip, I got the United Nations of Sausages........ Italian (Italy), Bratwurst (Germany), and a Polish (Poland).  I got all 3 topped with mustard, onion and hot sauce.  I had an online coupon for free fries too.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.  

I can't say enough about Ted's Hot Dogs.  They are without a doubt my favorite food in AZ and I will continue to come here.  Once I move out here in a few weeks, its going to take some major willpower to keep me away from this place.  They are simply the best!"}
{"text":"Alert the media!!!
Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after \"Buffalo Bill\", the cowboy showman...but \"Bills\" is an acronym for \"Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls\").
I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:)
Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask? 
Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know.
Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year.
So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:)
It's our good fortune, really. 
I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs.
And yet, they're just hot dogs. 
Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs.
The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me).
They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc. 
And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs!
And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs!
It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's. 
In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:

* Wait
     o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat
     o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!

* Ordering
     o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down (\"sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)
     o Bianco's - \"You want what on that pizza?!?! Chris will not make \"his\" pizza that way\"! \"Did you get my wine and cheese order Mr. Shaved Head-non-responsive bartender at Bar Bianco...hello...hello\"? \"Yes, I know I told you check with me every hour during the wait, but now that's annoying me\"

* Price
     o Ted's - 2 foot longs and diet coke for $11? That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)
     o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)

For the local \"Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division\", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:)
Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!"}
{"text":"Ted's has been around since I was a teenager, and before that.  I love the onion rings, and they give you a ton!  I was not as impressed with the all beef hot dog though.  It seemed really salty to me!  I do not remember it being that salty.  Well, it is still a cool place.  Hasn't changed much.  Love the onion rings!"}
{"text":"This is a solid hot dog place.  While not the best hot dog place I've ever been to, it definitely beats out most others.  

Mac n Cheese on a hot dog?  My inner fatty is ecstatic.
The onion rings are solid!

The regular dog is flavorful enough off the grill and packed plenty of flavor (though the chili and onion rings certainly added to that).  

I will definitely be back when I'm craving a hot dog."}
{"text":"Hot Dogs!  you either love em or hate them.  I have to say Ted's are some of the best.  I always have the all beef and change up the toppings.  There are a lot of toppings to chose from and don't forget to order their onion rings or fries a plenty.  And their milkshakes are the best.

Ted's makes hot dogs awesome.  If you need a hot dog fix head over to Ted's.  Yes there will be a line, yes you will get to know the people around you and yes you will have an awesome experience."}
{"text":"If you like good old fashioned hot dogs and hamburgers, you need to stop by Ted's when in the area.  Simple food, grilled the right way, in front of you with real hardwood charcoal.  It's all about the tech, the prodding, poking and scraping of the dog while its grilling, gives it that perfect consistency.  I've been coming to Ted's for over a decade and I can say they've never done me wrong.  The fries and onion strings are delicious, not sure if they do a half and half bag but that would be awesome, because the portion is huge.  I try and stop by when I'm in the area, I used to frequent this place weekly when I lived in Tempe years ago.  It's will definitely satisfy any hot dog or burger cravings!!"}
{"text":"I have come here since I was a kid and my wife and I eat here once or twice a month now.  It's packed every day for lunch and the evenings seem to attract more families for dinner.  The hot dogs or hamburgers are grilled in front of you and the staff is friendly and operates well behind the counter.

The restaurant is consistently spotless and everyone is very attentive to what you may need.  At the busiest times the seating space seems limited and you might need to take the food home.

Their milk shakes, fries, and onion rings are also really good though the fries seem to get soggy after they cool down so eat them quickly.

In all the times I've eaten here I have never had a bad meal, they have all been good."}
{"text":"You go here when you feel like going H.A.M. You order the footlong chili cheese dog and cheese fries and large soda and then like a bad hangover you hate life the next day. Even talking about it makes me feel fatter, but you know I will go back for more! In all seriousness pretty good dogs but I only make it here about once per year."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to visit Ted's when visiting Phoenix. Everything is good since the dogs/wieners are of such good quality and they use charcoal grilling. The white hot is good, the standard dog is good, but I usually opt for a brat or an Italian sausage. They have a great variety of toppings. Fries and rings are equally tasty. Wish they had beer."}
{"text":"Best secret spot I've got yet! They've got amazing food and great service. I admit my first and second visit I didn't really know how to work the menu. But after getting to the bottom of what I wanted, it was shear pleasure from there. I knew after the first visit I'd be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!  The dogs are grilled, NOT BOILED so they have that awesome \"backyard\" taste to them.  Avoid lunch rush or you'll be in line for a very long time.  But if you have the time, it's well worth it to see your dog cooked right before your eyes and dressed the way YOU want it."}
{"text":"Not quite what we expected, especially for the prices. The milkshakes were excellent though."}
{"text":"This is my hubby's favorite place when it comes to great hot dogs. Ted's does it right from beginning to end. Our favorite is a chilli cheese dog, add onions, and mustard. You cannot forget the french fries. By far the best fries I have ever had. The best thing is that they now offer dipping sauces for the fries. 
You seriously cannot go wrong when coming to Ted's. 
I'm a Ted's fan for life!!"}
{"text":"My fiance introduced this place to me when I first moved here and I was in love! I really enjoy seeing the food on the grill being made and the service is always friendly! and the food is fresh! You can't go wrong with a hot dog and chili cheese and hot fries! Yum yum! ;)"}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place so tried it. Food was average, price was ok, and the wait was way too long about 30 minutes for a fast casual experience. 1950's feel with 1950's food prep processes."}
{"text":"A staple of Tempe, all beef char grilled dogs to their finest.  This place is classic out of Buffalo, NY.  This place has been here forever and isn't going anywhere soon.  The secret? natural skin casings.  Grab yourself a loganberry drink and an all-beef and treat yourself, you deserve it."}
{"text":"I can't say I've been here too many times, mostly because I don't eat meat. But my boyfriend had never been here before and to my surprise, they did have veggie hot dogs! 

Went here on a Wednesday night before dance class (ha...suppose I can have fast food before exercising? Probably not). I got a veggie dog and fries. Service was super quick and the staff is really friendly. Either they put on a good show or genuinely enjoy working there. Added toppings to my heart's desire, even some peppers and onions which I guess were supposed to cost extra but they let me have for free ninety-nine. My only qualm is that it is cooked with the meat varieties. So if you're like offended by that sort of thing..well..I'm not even sure why you'd be eating there to begin with. It's only mildly bothersome to me. My boyfriend order a hot dog and fries as well. Our food was delicious. It's honestly one of the better veggie dogs I've had. Almost like a corn dog-type flavor. The fries were fresh and made to order. 

Overall a cool Tempe mainstay that I'd recommend to get your hot dog fix. Super affordable, fast & friendly service and most importantly, good food."}
{"text":"This was a staple during my pregnancy. Ted's is totally worth the wait, although I've never encountered really bad lines. The onion rings are just... omg. I always get the beef hot dogs. Perfect every time! Definitely a must for the weiner-lovers out there ;-)"}
{"text":"Every week, I try a new restaurant. Today work was extremely slow, and I found myself on Broadway. I thought why not  give Ted's a try. New to Arizona, I am on a quest to find the best Chili Dog in Phoenix and the surrounding area. It is with a heavy heart, that I say, Ted's doesn't have the best. I would rate his Chili Cheese Dog, perhaps somewhere in my top 20, but certainly not the best. 

First and foremost I'll begin with this; the service was lacking. Having been in the restaurant business for many years, my expectations are high. Upon walking in, (9:30 pm), I'm not greeted. I took initiative and greeted the grill girl. I explained that its my first time eating there. I then asked about the Chili Cheese Dog. The menu said it was $4.49. \"What do I get for $4.49?\" She then said I can have whatever I want. Right, but, you have various types of hotdogs, what kind do I get for that price? \" Um you can get all beef, I guess, and a foot-long. Or the regular.\" So for $4.49, I could choose either size hotdog, any type I want? \"Um... yeah but they're different prices.\" Ok... forget it. I'll have the All Beef Chili Cheese Dog. \"So you want chili on it?\" 

There's more but I'll spare you the entire conversation. I felt like the teenyboppers had very little to offer, in terms of hospitality, knowledge of the menu, or charisma. I like to feel welcomed and when I mention I'm new, I'd like someone to volunteer some popular sellers, or a personal choice. Recommend a menu item to me. Hype it up , make my mouth water, get me just as excited as you are. Nope... Not here. 

Food quality was pretty good. I ordered the... well I mentioned it already. I added the onion rings and a small soft drink. They offer no free refills. They charge $0.25 per refill. If you want ranch for your rings, like I do, that's $0.59 extra. Add tax to the bill and my total came out to nearly $12. The cheese for my Chili dog was cheese sauce, like you have with your nacho's, or I could have American cheese. I would have opted for grated cheddar, but a fine establishment like Ted's doesn't  offer it. For the price, I could have gone to Twin Peaks, Portillo's or darn near anywhere else and been served a far better meal. The onion rings were tasty and Diet Dr. Pepper is always a plus. Altogether, I'm not thrilled with my experience, however, I'll give them one more try in the future. Perhaps not so close to closing time."}
{"text":"Food is good and fairly priced.  I shared a regular hot dog topped with chili and Mac n cheese.  Also, we ordered a small fry with chili and cheese.  One thing to note is that they serve the chili and cheese on the side.  We found it a little difficult to just dip the fries since the chili is too heavy to be picked up by the fries,  I recommend just doing yourself a favor and pour the chili and cheese on the fries.  

The cooks seemed a little annoyed and didn't really care to answer our questions about the menu, so I knocked off a star.  The cashier was more than accommodating though and even let us sample the Loganberry drink.  It reminds me if the juice from Ikea.  Pretty tasty!

All in all, four stars."}
{"text":"For me, Ted's is nostolgia, remembering a childhood favorite food and the company of my grandparents in Tonawanda, NY. I hadn't had Ted's in almost 20 years, but luckily, work brought me to Phoenix and I made it down to the one Ted's location outside of NY. I was not disappointed. The hot dogs are as good as my childhood memories and I finally fulfilled a childhood dream of eating a footlong! The fries, onion rings, and shake were good, but nothing special. The star here is the charbroiled hot dog. If you're craving a a great hot dog or you want to take visit through childhood memories of NY, Ted's is the place."}
{"text":"Here now for the first time. Having watched a food channel special on hot dogs I needed a fix. I ordered the bratwurst( w/kraut & spicy mustard) & chili and cheese(w/onions). Both were spot on and had that charcoal grilled flavor that I like. I also got an order of onion rings to make sure I over ate....again. The Oring order was big enough to share. The line was pretty big mostly held up by tourists that were so amazed by the grilled dog process that they couldn't move or speak.
I would not hesitate to return. Stop going to Costco because thier dogs are $1.50.......try Teds for some flavor."}
{"text":"Ok.  I'm from Buffalo.  I spent many, many drunken teenage nights at Ted's!  I was ECSTATIC to find one right here in the Valley!
Sahlen's hot dogs...my mouth waters thinking about them!  They are REAL dogs, with the skin still at the ends.  
When you go, ask for Weber's mustard instead of crappy French's.  Weber's is a small factory in Western NY that still does everything by hand.  It's a horseradish mustard and the best!
Their onion rings are dunked and fried right in front of your eyes.  Not too much batter, and you can actually taste the onion.
Expect a line.  Anytime, day or night, it's packed!  THAT is how good this place is!
I love going, just to read the walls while waiting in line.  
It takes me back home to Buffalo.  A place I will never in my life go visit again, but at least I can eat the food I grew up with!"}
{"text":"I love the frys with cheese sauce here! Messy but soo good! I'm not a huge hot dog kinda girl but the italian sausage Is good. The lines can get very long, sometimes out the door! The shakes are great, but pretty thick! I haven't been here In awhile, but last time I had one, the straws they give you are the ones for the soda. Very tiny/thin, so It was almost Impossible to get any shake action from them. Fun place, lots of college students. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"You All have heard of the soup Nazi?  This is the hot dog Nazi..but well worth the abuse for the first timer.  You will be overwhelmed but you learn quick\""}
{"text":"I love this place. 
It's cash only, but there is an ATM.
Once you walk in, the grill is usually cooking some hotdogs and the smell hits you right away.
They have all sorts of incarnations of hotdogs and have a great selection of condiments and fixings to go on top.
All the ingredients are top notch quality. 
I usually go with the Bratwurst, but you can't really go wrong. 
The onions and peppers are a great touch, with the sauce being the best part. I'm pretty sure they sell it by the bottle. 
The same guy is working away at the grill everytime I've been, and he is definitely the best at grilling dogs I've witnessed. 

*Mental note - Pick up a bottle next trip*"}
{"text":"I was in there area and we saw the line OUTSIDE THE DOOR!  So, it got me thinking, how good does this hot dog place have to be for these people to wait for a couple good dogs.  I'm a hot dog fan so I was willing BUT had do some things.

So we ran some errands and let that lunch line settle down before coming back but this was a good choice.  The line was still a good amount and I'm sure this is the reg over here.  Well what the reg over here is to supply a good tasting dog.  You can do whatever you want to, very flexible, tons of options.

Really enjoyed the super \"laid back\" feel and the dogs were above and beyond. Get it Ted."}
{"text":"First time here (it's always busy every time I drive by, so I figured I would try it).
The food is - delicious - fresh - & for a good price - will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like \"sonoran\" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup \"hot sauce\" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog."}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are the best - all meat! Their hamburgers are even better (if you can imagine better than best) I am getting hungry just thinking about ordering one"}
{"text":"Ted's = The fuel that kept me running when I went to ASU.

I first came across Ted's after my classmates up'd and kidnapped me after our studio class one sunny afternoon.  I've never heard of the place and was intrigued with promises of the \"best wiener you'll put your lips [Sun Devils at their prime].\"  Upon entering the small establishment, the scent of meat sizzling on charcoal perfumed my senses.  I was sold.  I had the White Hot [veal and pork], a Regular with chili cheese, and a vanilla maltshake.  It was the best meal I had that long stressful year as a Digital Art major.  

If this is a taste of Buffalo, I'll gladly say that I love New York!  Been a faithful customer of Ted's since that first bite~"}
{"text":"I've never wanted a camera phone more than when waiting in the excessively long line for lunch at Ted's Hot Dogs.  Because no one would believe me that I was waiting in a line like this for HOT DOGS when there was no baseball game in the vicinity.  But then I tasted the dog's and now I understand completely, and I'll be waiting in line again some time soon.

Ted's was founded in 1927 for one purpose only - great hot dogs.  That has now expanded to about 4 different kind of dogs, burgers, fries and shakes.  The burgers and dogs are all cooked over a charcoal grill so it has that home cooked on the BBQ kind of taste.  They also have their own hot sauce that can be used on the burgers and dogs.  I had to try it and it's really yummy.  Just enough spice, but not too much.  Their Onion Rings were amazing, but I'm never getting them again when I'm alone!  They give a huge amount of them too.  They aren't thick cut, but instead cut exceptionally thin and served  squished into this funky origami with a base kind of serving thing.  You'll understand when you go. 

I haven't tried their shake yet, but it's made w/ real milk and ice cream, so you know I have to get it one of these days soon!  

Last note - their service is amazing.  Talk about a well run machine.  Girl working the grill is yelling out into the line to find out what they want so it can get started before they even approach the counter!  Another guy doing drinks and special orders.  Another girl doing toppings. Another girl manning the fryer.   And one guy ringing it all up.  These people didn't stop moving for a second the whole time I was here.  Really outstanding.  Almost as good as those dogs...."}
{"text":"With family in upstate New York, I grew up with trips to Ted's while visiting back east.  The charcoal grilled hot dogs always tasted sooo good.  

In high school, I discovered that Ted's had a location in Tempe, only a bit away from my parent's house in Mesa.  The yumminess of the food definitely translated west of the Mississippi.  Everything is so good and has that awesome taste of being grilled and perhaps fried (like the fries and onion rings)  without being too heavy.

I love standing in line, calling out my order when asked, buying Weber's mustard (I haven't found it sold anywhere else in Arizona), drinking fountain rootbeer that has a kick, looking at the Buffalo, NY paraphenalia that decorates the walls. 

On the trays, there is a paper with a quiz that I pretty much have memorized.  I know, from the quiz, that Ted's uses 7 million pickle spears per year.  I also always laugh with my friends over the easiest question on the quiz: \"True or False; there is a Ted's Hotdogs location in Tempe, AZ\" (the quiz was clearly written for my Ted's friends to the east).

It gets pretty crowded at lunchtime and stays that way through the afternoon.  I would suggest going slightly before noon or after 2:30pm."}
{"text":"I especially enjoy the dogs extra grilled so they're nice and blackened. Their french fries dipped in that cheese sauce are also a guilty pleasure. I love the place, although I haven't been in awhile I used to often. I've enjoyed the footlong and regular dogs, although the jumbo all-beef dogs are thicker and don't lend themselves to having the right consistency when charred. I'll take my non-all-beef hot dog complete with hooves and other weird animal parts, I'm sure, thanks. :)"}
{"text":"This place is rediculously good. No other hot dog joint compares. They have the system down to where the cook to order food comes out fast and fresh. I want to get married here."}
{"text":"If you're a college student living near ASU, this place is a go-to spot. The wait is a bit long at times, but it's pretty much worth it. My favorite has got to be the polish with ketchup, onions, tomatoes, bacon, sauerkraut, and some of their hot sauce. What's awesome about this place is the fact that you can put mac and cheese on your hot dog too + you get to see the staff cook it for you on their charcoal grill.

Overall:
Service - 5
Food - 5
Wait time - 3~4
Cleanliness - 4"}
{"text":"Really great hot dogs and onion rings! It's a little piece of the east coast in Tempe. 

Expect a long wait and be ready to order when it's your turn."}
{"text":"Totally good hotdogs! And my kids loved their corn dogs too! Totally worth the wait! Don't come expecting your typical hotdog."}
{"text":"I grew up coming to Ted's and would always bring family and friends when they were here from out of town. Today I went in for lunch and was amazed by all the new changes. It looked great at first glance. The menu has all these crazy options like Macaroni and Cheese Hotdog and a sea dog. They now take your order on an iPad instead of calling out like the old way. The line moved extremely slow as people tried to decide over the new menu and the employee tried to work the new technology. As we inched our way through the line the employees eyes were fixated at the new order screens and were too busy to have any customer interaction. We finally got our food and made our way to the once huge seating area that used to be full of booths. The seating area has now been replaced by cheap dollar shore chairs and tables. Not sure where the rest of the people in line plan to sit since there is very minimal seating now. Wish they would of kept the original Ted's. If it wasn't broke then don't fix it! I'll have to find a new spot to bring out of town visitors now."}
{"text":"This was the most awkward ordering experience I have ever had. We stood at the counter with 4 employees looking away and talking to each other until we were asked what we wanted. Upon asking for a cheeseburger, the guy who asked just walked away. He came back and we asked for another burger, gone again. So I asked someone else if we could have fries as well. The woman never responded just started talking to a guy next to her and put the fries in the oil. We stood at the counter being completely ignored while everything cooked. I realize this is how things are done when it's busy, but we were the only ones. The woman who made the fries finally gave us our total, and when we tried handing her payment she was too caught up in her conversation again to notice. We sat for another couple of minutes just trying to pay. This is a ridiculous way to treat customers, I felt like I was bothering them by coming in. On top of that the food was terrible. This will be our last time coming here."}
{"text":"After getting over the face that I'm pretty sure TED's hot dogs stole te TED talk typeface I walked in and order a couple corn dogs and there cheesy fries. 

The service was really great. Very sweet man and woman running the front when I went through. Super sweet and nice. Nothing wrong with the service. The food tho was mediocre on a Natasha beddingfield day! Like I'm feeling generous. The corn dogs were no better than something you'd get at sonic. I could've eaten a couple of them. They aren't very big and aren't very special. There spicy dipping sauce is probably the best part about them. The fries, don't get them. Get the onion rings. The fires are so bad I wanted to die eating them. The onion rings aren't bad they're really light but they still taste better than the reheated fries. 

All and all the place was eh, probably won't ever go back but I'm not super upset I went. It was fine for lunch with my coworkers and I liked my corn dogs. So yeah. Thanks TED but I like your talks better."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Ted's with my dad when I was a kid. This would be a classic example of you can't go home again. Waited almost 20 minutes in line for a lukewarm, barely-grilled chili dog and french fry/onion ring crumbs. Thought about complaining, but between the long, very(!!) slow-moving line and the completely inept counter people--hence the slow line movement--I couldn't really muster the patience. Definitely going to stick with Detroit Coney Grill from now on. Sorry Ted's, I'll remember you fondly from my youth, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"HEART BURN CITY! 

hot dogs, burgers, fries- about $3-4 each. 
Its like a subway for hot dogs. They grill it and the next person fills it with whatever you like. then you move down to pay. 

Choices of your meat: brats, all beef, polish, etc..
Toppings: Kraut, ketchup, mustard, pickles, relish, onions, chili, melted cheese sauce, italian peppers. 

The onion rings were great. Thin and thick, reminds me of Chilis onion rings. 

We are visitors from CA and cam across this place after a baseball game. 

It was a good fix, but we ran to Walgreens for Tums right after."}
{"text":"A very good, all beef hot dog!  

Surprisingly good, but a hell of a long wait to get it unless you come early and miss the lunch crowd, and a slightly intimidating ordering process if you are a first timer.  I need to come try other things here, but so far I can vouch for the all beef hot dog.

Oh, and a free piece of salt water taffy at the register for dessert!  (Yas!!)"}
{"text":"Great Food! Expensive. They have hot dogs from Buffalo NY. Good fries, onion rings and shakes. I recommend!!"}
{"text":"Still trying to figure out what the big deal is about this place.

Onion rings were good, so I'll give them that.

Had a foot long and a regular chili dog.

Foot long was average pretty much in every way.  Bun was slightly stale and hard.

Chili dog was average.  Chili was below average.

Diet Dr Pepper was more soda water than Dr Pepper.

If you measure all hot dogs on the planet on straight line continuum with the $1.50 Costco special being the mid point, I'm not sure this place measures up to the mid point.

One other thing...$12 bucks and change for a foot long, chili dog, onion rings and a soda...YIKES!!!

But then again, maybe I just don't get it.

2.5 wasn't a choice, but 3 is to high."}
{"text":"Very simple menu, fresh ingredients, good quality dogs and sausages. These are the top things I noticed about the food. There aren't a whole lot of choices but what they have is really fresh and good. I love all beef hot dogs charbroiled (as in made on an actual grill) and this place didn't miss a beat. The onion rings were a mount of fried goodness. The malts were made with real ice cream and milk. Delicious.

The service was great too. Simply a line of people smiling and cooking the dogs to order. Another smiling face topping your hot dog with deliciousness. Then the cashier who is friendly and quick. On top of that you have a couple of people running around compiling the order. 

The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Nice new york meets arizona decor. Kind of sporty. A great place for some cheap grub. Lots of different kinds of people there too which was great. We had college folks, little kids with their parents, some elders and a few middle aged folks. This is basic, good food with a nice atmosphere for a decent price."}
{"text":"Kind of pricey - for hot dogs, fries, shakes - but sometimes splurging is worth it - and this is the place to do it. Great malts/shakes - great onion rings and fries, great burgers. And of course, great dogs. Just expect a $25 check for two before the splurge begins."}
{"text":"Old restaurant that I used to frequent when I attended ASU and then worked in Tempe. 

Loved the Bratwurst and Hamburgers that are grilled over a flame to give it the real bbq grill taste. 

When they are finished cooking your order then you tell them what to put on your burger or hotdog. Good selection of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and many other items.

Had their french fries which were nice and crispy and a generous amount. 

Ate here around 300 pm so it was not to busy which was nice to not have to fight the crowds.

The cooks are pretty pushy so be ready when your food is ready.

Will not take such a long time to eat here again and be back soon"}
{"text":"After watching the fourth of July hotdog eating contest, I had to get my grub on. Found this place on yelp and it's freaking legit. The cheese sauce is super delicious and so are their dogs!"}
{"text":"These are hot dogs. Even the best hot dog on earth can't possibly be as good as, say, the median cheeseburger. And yes, you can get a cheeseburger at Ted's for a buck or two more, and they aren't awful. You can get lots of things that aren't awful. You can also get non-awful hot dogs by grilling them yourself at $1.25 for an eight-pack.

Usually the onion rings are good. Disclaimer - I used to work at Ted's. As a starting employee, I wasn't even allowed to know what was in the onion ring batter. All I knew was that making them involved someone dressing up in a garbage bag, ostensibly to keep from getting covered in batter. Anywho, this time around, the onion rings weren't even cooked through. 

This, despite the grill man's comment that the girl running the fryer was the best they had. 

That's saying something. Kids would walk out on the job when they got put on fryer. It's a lot to handle, and you go home with a millimeter of reduced fry oil coating all parts of your body. Even the orifices. Especially the orifices. 

So then, there is also a strange and outdated system of customer service that certainly requires more labor than is necessary. You'll see."}
{"text":"Had the veggie dog (vegetarian) this time. While I'm not sure they were super happy with for for that, it was a really good veggie hot dog. I would not have known it wasn't a real hot dog. Funny thing is, I almost got it with chili and cheese. :)  Anyway, got it 'my' way, with hot sauce, mustard and onions. Add a side of fries and loganberry, and it was a great Ted's lunch."}
{"text":"Location: There are lots of tables at the restaurant. You will never have to worry about not having a table. They also have a station for u to get your ketchups, napkins, straws etc.....they keep the section relatively clean. 

Service: you basically ordered your food, sit down and eat. Therefore, I only rate this restaurant based on food only. 

Food: I ordered a Polish hot dog and it was pretty tasty. The Vanilla milk shake was super delicious. It wasnt too watery or too thick. I will definitely order that again. However, I was disappointed in the curry fried. It was mostly burnt. 

Rating: I'll come back here to try something else"}
{"text":"I came to Ted's last week to meet up with the lunch UYE group, but I was a little late and they were on their way out.  So, I waited in the line, alone, to order a dog to go.  The funny thing, they call to you from behind the grill to place your order.  As they were calling for my attention, I looked around over my shoulder as if to say, \"Oh, you're talking to me\" when the cook was calling for my attention... haha, that's something you should look out for so you're not caught off guard if its your first time around the block.

I got the beef dog with ketchup, mustard and a pickle.  They grill the hot dog on an open flame.  The dogs don't taste \"grilled\" enough for my tastes, but it was ok.  I really enjoyed the onion rings that I ordered on the side.  Very tasty.  

I won't miss this place if I don't go back.  But if someone wants to go, I'll meet them there.  No problem."}
{"text":"We've heard a lot of good things about Ted's. In truth right now with 2 total visits they are inconsistent. The first visit was pretty great. Hence why we decided to go again. Unfortunately, the second visit was a disappointment. We both had a Braughtwurst and a All-Beef Jumbo. All-in-all they were just okay. We as much as anyone like the charcoal grill sausages but we still like to taste the meat; the sausages were just way over grilled and their strongest flavor was charcoal. One other disappointment is the fries; they're great if you do not also have the onion rings in same visit. This is a problem because you will quickly be able to tell that they fry the potatoes and the rings in same oil. If you're allergic to one or the other don't get either."}
