{"text":"The staff at VS was so helpful professional & so nice, it was my first visit to this VS & they made it a great first visit. They even held a item for me till I could get there. VS is one of my favorite stores. Thank u all for making a Texas girl feel welcomed"}
{"text":"Excellent local mall. It's really gone uphill in the last few years. The store selection has improved dramatically, with new additions like Teavana and H&M.  Their food court is also high quality as well. An excellent place for those in the area to shop."}
{"text":"Had a pretty funny experience.  It was a very rainy day and I thought I'd take my camera and snap a few photos of the holiday decorations at this mall.  My camera club is having a holiday photo competition.  I was stopped by the mall security and told I needed to apply for a permit to take photographs in this mall. I told the mall security guard I was from NJ and he ask about a recent mall shooting in the state.  I responded that I was pretty sure that the person was not shot dead with a camera.  I didn't have an issue with this and complied, but thought it was very typical of Ohio culture where cameras are viewed as more dangerous than guns.

The mall is neat and clean and has a good selection of stores.  My grandchildren love to shop there."}
{"text":"We came shopping at the end of our day so there was limited to exposure to some of the stores... We did get some of the things we were looking for at affordable priceS!!"}
{"text":"Mall is very dead. What ever happen to all the cool stores? The mall even has empty store fronts. This is more likely going to end up like Euclid Square or even Rolling Acres. Now that they added Dicks Sporting Goods and BJS Brew House. Let's see if the mall is going to come back to life"}
{"text":"Their security company (as of a few years ago), Valor Security Services, is run by absolute psychopaths. The mall's \"head of security\" came to my workplace and threatened me with arrest over a social media comment. When I called the police on this guy, they said they were familiar with him as he often \"thinks he's a real cop\" and has no authority to arrest anyone. 
When I complained to mall management, they refused to fire the guy but said they would talk to his company. 

When the regional manager of Valor got back to them, he had a fabricated email that he claimed was written by me that cleared his employee of any wrongdoing. The email address that he claimed I had sent it from didn't even exist, and when I asked for the original email instead of just a typed up copy, he refused to talk to me. They then had their lawyer send me a letter stating \"the original email was deleted.\"

Lesson: don't trust a mall that won't stand up for a customer and hires a security company that harasses the public and then creates fraudulent documents. 

Gross place. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This is a dying mall over 10 years in the making. Just take a look around at the undesirable people that hang out and loiter."}
{"text":"Still 2 stars, GLM. 

The food court is even worse now. They added these large tv's everywhere that play top 40 music videos. I won't lie and say I wasn't dancing in my seat to La Roux and Gaga while I ate my crappy pseudo Greek food... but seriously, the music is loud and it echoes and makes it almost difficult to carry on a conversation. It also makes it much easier to want to get the F outta there. 

My son loved The Disney Store. It was tough to get him out of there. 

This mall seems to be suffering. It will probably end up like Euclid Square if they don't get some better stores soon."}
{"text":"They put a Teavanna, H&M, and Forever 21 in. While I'm happy about this, compared to Beachwood Place or Summit Mall, Great Lakes is simply meh. I go here for convenience, nothing more."}
{"text":"I've been going to this mall since I was a kid.  It is a great mall with a lot of stores at different price points.  They recently remodeled the entire mall and it looks great!  The food court also has a good variety of restaurants."}
{"text":"The mall seemed to be rather desolate but than again I went on a week day during work hours. I like that it's a very straight forward layout. It has all the stores you could want imo. Not too sure about the food court. There is even a gym in the mall, however, it's a Planet Fitness....lol"}
{"text":"*Sad Face* my childhood mall is going down the pooper. 

I feel like this mall has been on the steady decline since I was a little Cara. Granted, it does have a few savior stores, but for the most part they've all come and gone. There used to be a Gap... an Aldo... all bye-bye!

Don't get me wrong, Great Lakes Mall does have some redeeming qualities. For one, the quality stores they do have tend to have more of my sizes left since they're not as busy as other malls. Score! The staff at most shops seem to be nicer and willing to actually assist you. For instance, every time I go to The Limited I don't want to leave! The girls there are so wonderful and give you honest opinions. It's like having a private shopper! This mall is also doing a better job of filling in empty spaces, which is way better than hearing the echo of your own voice down the hall. 

One last positive that I'll mention: this mall is easy to shop. Why? Well, it's usually empty. I admit, I live to shop. But I never like a crowded store or mall... in fact, it's infuriating! Especially when I just stop in to grab something quick and it takes forever because some idiot is holding up a line over a huge return that she clearly just shoplifted. (God. I love run-on sentences.)

With Great Lakes Mall, I'm usually in and out--no annoying hassles or crowds."}
{"text":"Where to start?


I like this mall. I much prefer it to Richmond or Beachwood, however, I chose a very bad day to visit.

1st the good. They have a Spencer and a decent food court.  They have all the stores I want to shop at and the sales tax is less than the Cuy.  Oh Fuji the Japanese place is pretty dam good.  Lunch special for 10 bucks choose 3 rolls plus soup and salad. The staff at this mall are pretty friendly and actually ask if they can help me. Lots of parking!

The Bad:
 The mall  is located in Mentor. Ever been to Mentor? It is a cultural void, Soccer Mom infested,  soulless, chain store infested suburban wasteland.  I have never seen such a concentration of Italian and pizza restaurants. Here is how it goes while driving, Chain store, Italian restaurant, gas station, tanning place, fast food restaurant, pizza joint, rinse and repeat.  It is obviously very sunny here as a lot of younger people have tans. This place used to be farm land many moons ago!

The Ugly:  
The day I came here there was a competition for singing the National Anthem.  I love this country  but to hear this over and over made me want to put a bullet in my head. This was probably worse than water boarding.  I mean it's not an easy song to sing and half these people had no business even trying it.  They seem to have all these free cars that you have a one and a bizzilion chance of wining. All you have to do is give them your personal information."}
{"text":"I just went there the other day.  I haven't been there since they redid the mall and it looks like it was just built.  Great Lakes is your typical \"generic suburban mall\".  They have the typical anchor stores (Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, and Dillards) and then the typical stores like Hot Topic, FYE, Abercrombie and Fitch, Spencers, etc...  I forgot the Gap closed here which shows how often I shop at the Gap.  The Disney Store and the Indians store are also pretty awesome.
I agree with the mall being over run with kids.  I was there on a Friday night and there were packs of teenagers roaming the mall.  But I didn't feel threatened or unsafe so whatever."}
{"text":"Went to the mall to get my daughters ears pierced. We went to Piercing Pagoda first, which that experience was great. Next I went to JCPenny to go to Sephora. Not only did they deny my niece samples. I was told that Urban Decay and a promotion and for every purchase you will receive a free liner at the register. When I reach the register to buy a $22 lip stick. I was not properly greeted and did not receive my free gift. The young lady next to me did and more. But it seems I was being rushed out the store. It's sad because the person that greeted me at the door was really nice. But the cashier not so much. I love shopping at this JCPenny location but will second guess every going in Sephora again. Also they do not show up on Yelp for me to send them a person review. #treatcustomersequally"}
{"text":"I hate to one star up the queen of Yelp(sorry Cara) but given my options in Richmond Heights, the GLM is A-OK with me.  I know, I know, I am really close to Beachwood and Legacy, but these places are 4-5 star malls that I feel like I need to dress up to go to.

Great Lakes is probably on the downfall but when it comes Christmas time I always find myself walking from store to store looking for deals.  Now if you want a good comparison and really have to know what a mall looks like when it completely goes belly up, then go to the Richmond Mall on Richmond and Wilson Mills.  You'll be high tailing it back to Mentor in an instant.

I don't  really do mall food except for pretzels at Auntie Anne's so I have no comment or recommendations in the food court.  But there are plenty of fast food joints outside the mall for you to stop at after your shopping."}
{"text":"The Mall is not that great. Lots of closed shop. I normally go there just for the Mall walk-athon exercise and leave. It's a bunch of teenage hangouts. there's no store for me that makes me go there any soon."}
{"text":"Okay really.... this mall could be a lot better. It feels pretty old and there aren''t that many great stores. The H&M is fine.. and there are a few others. But overall, just not near as nice as some other malls closer to Cleveland. The food court is a little weak too."}
{"text":"I love this mall ! Very peaceful and not over rated like South Park mall. You can come here on a Saturday and this mall is still not crowded like South Park Mall. They have all the stores that I love to shop at like: Charlotte Russe, V S, H&M, Sephora ( inside JCpenny), Shoe Department, Forever 21, Windsor, Bath & Body Works, and Gymboree. Love taking my son here to play in the kids area and riding the train. They also have a food court with a variety of food, from American, Asian, and Italian."}
{"text":"The name of the place is fujis restaurant. This is,an excellent place to eat. The food is wonderful and the staff  is warm and welcoming. Great place to dine weather it is lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First timer. Nice mall. Has all the regular anchor stores I like, including Dick's. Easy to get around. Clean. Has a food court. Sears Automotive is in the parking lot. Can walk to a few restaurants. I'll return."}
{"text":"VICTORIAS SECRET;

If you are a size small or XS  or mixed race like myself, be prepared to be shunned and discriminated against & for the workers to call you an \" anorexic\" or \" n - - - - r lips\" over the ear piece to the cashier as she's giggling  while spending close to 200.00 and for the manager to not do anything but side with the employees. I guess this is how they treat their angels credit card holders.

I was with my friend & and we were walking around the mall and I always like to browse a Victoria's Secret whenever there is a chance , especially now that I have an Angel's Card , I love shopping for gifts there & was a loyal customer for over 10 years.

We walked in & a gorgeous burgundy body suit had struck my fancy. I then looked for a salesperson as the store had hard anyone in it & managed to finally find one. I am not sure of her name (after a huge run around, I was told her name is Lyn) but she had sort of messy hair, glasses & wore all black..her skirt was sort of witchy and scary and she was definitely on the bigger side which is fine, but she could have at least treated me with respect. I asked her if the bodysuits that were on the rack were the only sizes (they had l & xl). She said whatever was on the floor is all they had. I then asked if there were any in the back stock room ( I have had employees at other stores go in the back to locate stuff that was out of stock & found it successfully in the past). She then took a nasty & sharp tone & said \"mam.. I just told you that what we have out here is it in sizes\". I told her i was only asking since most of the stores always have smaller sizes. her kind reply \" these are the sizes that normal people wear. Anorexia is not common in these parts . you have a weight issue  ..only thing that would fit you here is on the  mannequin its a size a size small.\" 
I was flabbergasted by her nasty reply that was completely unwarranted. Her co worker with kinda dark curly hair  wearing all black was sort of chuckling in the corner.
 By this time, she had already pulled the bodysuit off the mannequin for me. I decided to go ahead & get the bra & thong..where as most people would have walked off. When it came time to buy the thong she helped me for the thong size her snarky nasty tone reared its heinous head again \"lemme guess..you're an xs or a small\"? as she made her nasty face at me.
I went to pay & the girl behind the till had her little earphone that they use to communicate with one on another on loud and hanging off her ear , so I could her the salesgirl tell her \"watch out for the crack who - r with the n - gg - r lips\" The girl behind the counter laughed. After I paid, I said to her you guys are all a bunch of rude pigs..theres a planet fitness here ..so if you feel so bad about your weight..go work out\" she called me the C word.
Victorias secret did NOTHNG ABOUT IT. I spoke ti the store manager & she \"didnt have time to deal with this\" . so, needless to say, I am done shopping here.Its a shame they let people  like that work there & most of all allow sales reps treat customers like this."}
