{"text":"Good food, very friendly service. Was a pleasant surprise. Don't think you have to go there only to watch sports on TV. There is a second room adjacent to the bar that is quiet enough for a conversation. The manager was very accommodating when my friend didn't like her drink.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Sweetwater. As soon as we got out of the car, we could smell the burgers cooking like a backyard get together. I ordered the breakfast burger and sweet potatoes fries. The best hamburger I have had in a long time. It was fresh and juicy. Egg, bacon and burger!   My wife had the seared ahi tuna and salad. The tuna was cooked perfect and the honey wasabi vinaigrette was awesome.  The atmosphere is casual, sports barish but in  an upscale way. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great wait staff. Tasty food and well-managed events. A nice addition to Lake Wylie! We are weekly customers!"}
{"text":"Decent food, GREAT BEER selection, and good service. It is a bar, ok, a Sports Bar, so it ain't the fricking Cordon Bleu!  Very nice staff, seated quick, tons of TV's, served fast--what more you WANT????"}
{"text":"I wish more than anything that Sweetwater would take over T Bones!  The food is really good.  I get the nachos all the time. They are always hot and piled high for sharing. TVs are everywhere so you can catch any game you want and they also have NTN trivia which is fun. The staff are really friendly and fast.  Never had a bad time here!  The only downside to the place is the parking and the inside is small so it fills up fast - that is why I wish it would they would take over T Bones!"}
{"text":"My wife loves their shrimp. I had some boneless wings(get mild) hot is really hot! Nice little sports bar. Lots of TV's. Waitress was very attentive and polite. Food was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!   Great service.  Great food!  Southern  hospitality!  Beer choice is great. Maura  above and beyond server.  LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"This place has great shrimp and grits and the other food is very good as well!! I loved my pomegranate martini and the bartender kept the drinks coming without us having to hunt her down or Waite for a while ! I met new friends bc everyone was extremely friendly! The environment food and drinks were An A+! Will definitely be back'"}
{"text":"I am giving Sweetwater 2 stars since it is listed on Yelp under \"Dog Friendly Restaurants\". Sweetwater is definitely NOT dog friendly.  Although they have an outdoor covered patio for dining, they also have picnic tables up near the road by the fence and on gravel, which would be perfect.  There is no where in Lake Wylie to go and have a drink with your friends that allows dogs to accompany you, let alone outside dining. A huge drawback to the community and in this case...False Advertisement."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. They open at 1100 and it was about 1120. Front room was already pretty crowded so we sat at a low top in the addition. Lots if tvs. Lots of sports. My husband was in Heaven. Lol. Definitely family friendly. There were several families with young kids. Overall. Friendly place.  Now the food. I tried the medium buffalo wings. Flats only. The sauce is very tasty. Once the hot vinegar fumes settled down (those wings were HOT out of the fryer)  the taste was one of the best I've ever had. Just the right amount of spicy with out making my tongue cry  and I could taste a nice seasoning to the sauce. Maybe onion powder? I got mine with ranch. Must be home made. Not sweet like some of the bottles are. Herby and delish.  10 wings 8.99. Well worth it. Friendly waitress. Will definetly come back!"}
{"text":"Warm beer, good food and service. First time trying it out tonight and will likely be back. Packed on a random Monday so they're doing something right. Tonight was not a good night if you wanted cold beer. A little surprised the waitress didn't take the warm one off my tab."}
{"text":"Always a great place with good food, friendly wait staff and cold beer.  Broad selection of craft beer too."}
{"text":"Best wings and burgers in town! Never had a bad meal here and they are great for games. Weekly specials are awesome too. Love the .60 wing Monday's"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this place for the first time last Saturday night around 7:30pm. The wait time for a table was 30-40 min. I expected this for a weekend prime time meal. This was our first time dining at this place. I went due to the reviews on Yelp. Once seated, we did wait substantially for anyone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. This was approximately 15 minutes. I do understand that is was a very busy time in the evening, but would have at least been able to order an ice water. Our waitress was Emily. Once our drink order was taken, everything else was a great experience. Emily was very nice and attentive, offered suggestions about the menu, and was pleasant to talk to. Our food was really great. We both had burgers, which were amazing. The food will definitely bring us back. The only real complaint is that when the place is that busy, there is no place to stand/sit while waiting for a table without being \"in the way\" of others.  We will come back another \"non-busy\" time to order the awesome food. I hope to give it 5 stars then."}
{"text":"We love sweet water and their management and host team. VIP treatment every time! Sweet Water is the best place to eat in south Charlotte period!!!! Better Food than any chain bar and grille and tons of high def screens for all you sports! Priced right too! Go Panthers!!!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good wings here, but apparently the management is too cheap to use the heat inside. 28° outside prob 40° inside.... luckily for them there isnt many choices in lake wylie... yet"}
{"text":"Walk in and it instantly felt like a neighborhood bar. It is darker than I prefer but you get use to it after a while A great dive bar where you can always get a cold beer and great food.  They have daily specials and the shrimp and grits special on Fridays is a must.   Great for family or just hanging with friends. They also have an outside seating area worth picnic tables and you are enjoy a game of corn hole. Don't know weekday beer you want or want to step out of your beer comfort zone then Sal is your man. He knows his beer!  Staff works well together. TVs galore and all appetizers are under $10. Beer and mixed drinks flow equally and the bar staff know their stuff. They usually have tap takeovers on Thursdays. Flights available. Noise level was moderate so convo is easy.    Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burgers! I came here at around 5:00 for an early dinner and I was quickly seated with my party. I was served my water in fewer than 2 minutes and was offered appetizers. We ordered buffalo chicken dip as our appetizer and it was sooooo good! It was perfectly spicy and creamy while the chicken was amazingly moist and delicious. It also came very quickly! That being said, the staff and service was absolutely phenomenal! I ordered a cheeseburger and I was very satisfied and happy with it. The meat was moist and cooked to perfection while the bun was toasty on the outside and soft in the inside. The French fries and sweet potato fries were delicious as well and came with a marshmallow fluff sauce. All in all, I will definitely come back here to Sweet Water for another delicious burger!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  A huge variety of beer is always a welcome sight after a long  day."}
{"text":"Ate here shortly after moving to the area. Place was super busy but the service was too notch, food was great and price was good for what you get. My only complaint, I ate waaaaay too damn much. Ha ha. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Not being in the mood for burgers or wings left me with very few options. I eventually decided on the Southern Fried Chicken Club Wrap. Who doesn't like a good wrap? Well we sat at a table where the air conditioning was blowing right at us on an already cold and rainy night. Not that bad yet, but when I got the wrap, the chicken was hot, but the rest of the wrap was cold! Continued trying the wrap and it lead to no avail."}
{"text":"Gave it another shot this Saturday 11.8.14. Great buger, good price but the fries are not the best and you would have to spend another $1.50 to substitute for say mac n cheese, tots or buffalo chips etc. Maybe .99 cents would be more inline or at least let something like tots or house chips be substituted at no extra charge I cannot see the cost being that much different than regular fries. They had a beer special and the games were on. If you wanted to watch a certain game they would gladly change the tv for you. I did wait  a little bit longer to get my meal than most places but they had a steady crowd and I was not in a hurry but if I was it would have been a little bit too long to wait, I would say 30 minutes or more for the meal to arrive after ordering. For Lake Wylie this is the go to place especially if you are wanting to watch sports. They put an effort into doing things right and keep a full staff. I cannot think of another place in the area that can compete with Sweetwaters other than being home and watching a game with beers from the fridge."}
{"text":"Great food, great people great service Thanks Courtney &  Katie...great girls.  They know exactly who I am and know what I want to drink before I even have to ask.  I love this place.  Food is great.  Staff is attentive and willing to help out.  They run around getting orders, bringing orders and this is outside when it's hot as...you know.  I have never ordered anything I didn't like.  Monday's are wing specials...Wednesday is Family bingo...Thursdays are cornhole tournaments, Friday's Karaoke.  Just a coll place in Lake Wylie.  Thanks for everything Sweetwater- Panthers Eagles tonight GO PANTHERS"}
{"text":"Great martinis!!! And the best mac n cheese ever!!!! Also I highly recommend you get sweet potato fries , the cinnamon fluff dipping sauce is to die for"}
{"text":"Great family friendly spot on bar, with decent tap selections.  Good food, lots of burger choices.  Crispy battered fries and excellent large juicy tenders with lots of season sauces.  Salads are huge, fresh and delicious. Ahi tuna is excellent.  Top off meal with a hot pretzel crusted brownie with four scoops of golden vanilla icecream.   Not too loud and not dark, fun relaxing atmosphere with tvs at the bar.   Great spot."}
{"text":"Food is good. But as far as a sports bar. Was asked to leave when the Panthers were going into over time with the GreenBay Packers. What sports bar closes during a game? The manager who's father owns it, has a chip on his shoulder. Very rude, superior attitude. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, Guinness on tap awesome! Friendly staff bartenders and waitstaff. Parking is crazy but found a spot. Mac and cheese is soo good, creamy. Buffalo chicken sandwich made as a wrap in honey habanero very good. Oh my the sweet/kick was great. Fries good. Burger wasn't the greatest. Dry and lack of flavor. Pricing for everything was typical. BATHROOM is another subject...Unisex AND you have to go past the URINAL to get yo sink to wash hands. Smelled and looked somewhat clean. The amount of people and size of the place WHY a unisex bathroom.  If return will be for drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great place for drinks and APPETIZERS!!! The buffalo chicken dip was amazing and it looked really good. Unfortunately the burgers looked good but it smelled like an old chard grill that's never been cleaned. The smell was so strong it rubbed off onto my hands and the taste was even worse than the smell. You could tell the burger had been cooked on a griddle but than on one side it had grill marks. also the onion rings were very sad the batter tasted like pancake batter and was barely sticking to the onions."}
{"text":"This restaurant comes highly recommended in my circle of LKW friends. And it is a great little spot to grab a quick bite or hang out with friends to watch a sports event or play cornhole outside. Not meant to be a fine dining establishment,  it's menu is pretty standard bar fare, but pretty tasty!  My first visit I had a burger and sweet potato fries. Both were good.  The fries were pretty good, but the dipping sauce...did not like at all.   Second visit, the next week, I had one of the chicken sandwiches prepared with teriyaki sauce and it was very good as well and the grilled pineapple and sauce on it was perfect!  Check it out if you haven't...the chef is known to be followed from place to place, so you just might be missing out!"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here from the wings to the shrimp and grits has been FABULOUS!  Very friendly atmosphere - great service; professional but still with a \"down home\" friendliness.   I love to play Trivia -- and Triviasaurus with Nick V is in the house on Wednesday night -- fun group!"}
{"text":"Really good food and friendly service! We have been here a few times and always look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is really good, I don't  really care for french fries but the fries here are so delicious I eat them all"}
{"text":"Always amazing service and delicious food when we dine in. The servers are always on point and the managers always come around to check on each table. More local places could learn from this level of service! Tonight, we ordered a To Go order and took it home only to realize they forgot the buffalo chicken dip (chips but no dip). We called up there and to my surprise, they DROVE out here to my house (about 15 minutes away so not at all close to the restaurant) and delivered the buffalo chicken dip. Wow. That was beyond my expectations. You have patrons for life!!!!"}
{"text":"Good, friendly service, nice sports bar atmosphere.  Great chicken tenders and fabulous patty melt."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it is noisy inside.  They have multiple sports on TV going, which is great, but with the volume on all it does is make a small restaurant noisy inside.  Has a nice outside area, but it is not usable unless you are a smoker."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time tonight. Loved it! Prompt, friendly service was the first plus. The food was reasonably priced and I couldn't believe the amount of food that arrived at our table. My husbands burger was delicious and so was my chicken wrap. The lady next to us had a salad that would feed our entire family. Great food, great service, great prices. We will be back! Next time however we will share- one meal is more than enough for two people!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Good food, friendly service, and a decent draught beer selection! Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great sports bar!  Love their buffalo chicken wrap and the spud chips.  Also the mac and cheese is wonderful!"}
{"text":"We were driving thru and needed some good food, came here on Yelp reviews and this place didn't disappoint. My I say, we love and highly critique mac & cheese, and this mac and cheese is a full 5 star. That said, the burgers were big and beautiful. Our mediums were more medium well, but great flavor and wonderful toppings for pizza burger and Hawaiian. Will order medium rare next time, but great burger... did I mention get the Mac and cheese ;)"}
{"text":"Tables are tight together especially near the entrance door.   Food was good,  but was not the quickest place to get a bite to eat.   Went with 6 total in our party,  had a little wait and waitress was not the quickest on service.   Would recommend for food taste,  if not in any type of rush."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Lake Wylie. Great beers on tap, and excellent pub fare. The onion rings are excellent, and kids night Tuesday for 1.99 can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some friends on our way to an event. This is the place I wish was around the corner. We all ordered burgers and they were great. Each one was a different one of their specialties. One ordered a build your own. Burgers came out perfect and they were huge. My husband and I shared and they brought them already cut with their own fries. The sweet potato fries were some of the best I ever had. I'm not a burger person but I would order again. If we are ever out that way again I will definitely make sure we stop in here."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave restaurants in Lake Wylie!! Their food is amazing here!!! The burgers are awesome, and their homemade chips are the bomb; ask for them \"floppy\". Their peel & eat shrimp is good, the wings are awesome, and their nachos are layered with the good stuff and are huge!!!  Def get there before the rush, and they get busy fast if it's trivia night, a game day or summertime! Worth the wait every time!!!   My family loves to eat here! And their take out is good too!!"}
{"text":"Burger is tasteless, chili with beans on a burger is not good, beef is flavorless.  Really could get a better burger at Wendy's for half the price.  Only finished it because it cost so much.  This is a burger joint so expect much better burger."}
{"text":"Got the cheesesteak (get it with American cheese). Was SO good. Got sweet potato fries and they were also great AND the sauce that comes with them is OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD! My husband got the Friday special of Shrimp and Grits. They were great also! Son got peel and eat shrimp and fries and was happy but wasn't thrilled with the coleslaw (I make mine different). Service was great. Waitress even offered helpful suggestions. Will be back."}
{"text":"VERY good place to eat.  The menu is better than your average sports bar.  We started with lobster mac n cheese fritters. So good.  They had an eel sauce drizzle... at a sports bar!! We tried 4 different wing sauces.. all were great... fries were good.. service was fantastic.. The whole staff was working hard,  prebussing each other's tables, running food... I was very impressed with my first visit and will certainly be back"}
{"text":"I live around the corner and I absolutely love this place. I like to start with the buffalo chicken dip or the quest blanco. Usually, I get the California Yard Burger which btw is delicious. Their sweet potato fries are heavenly, but once you taste the marshmallow dip they're served with you'll be on cloud 9! I end up having to get like 3 boxes, but the food even holds up for leftovers the day after."}
{"text":"We live nearby and recently moved into the area.  My husband wanted to dine here and I was really not interested - I didn't want to have a bunch of greasy bar food.  Well, one night we were really tired and I decided to give it a go since I really didn't feel like cooking or traveling far to dine.  I am SO glad we decided to go and I have been back numerous times.  Their salad and salmon is absolutely fantastic and it makes me spoiled for salmon anywhere else.  I have gone to other restaurants to eat salmon only to be disappointed and to return to Sweetwater for their version!  The wings, burgers, side dishes, sandwiches - everything is excellent.  My family LOVES their tuna appetizer and their nachos are HUGE.  The staff is always great and friendly and they do keep your glass full.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is great. Never a bad a experience. There sometimes can be a wait, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"All their burgers are pretty good, but the true start is the sweet potato fries with the special sauce.  Pro tip: always ask for extra of the sauce!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. I've probably had maybe one or two things wrong with my order that entire time.  The only problem I can recall is when I got stale hot dog buns. They were extremely hard and stale, should of been caught, but that was the only thing that sticks out and it was months ago. I haven't had any problems since.   Most of the times I've went is with a large group, and I can't recall any times when other peoples orders were messed up either."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm enough said! Love love love the food. The outdoor area is very nice too. The service is always very good. Sometimes not family friendly but it is a sports bar."}
{"text":"My first time here with a large party for a birthday! Cannot say enough good things about this place. Amelia was our waitress and she was awesome! The manager brought us a shot for 14 of us and desert for the birthday girl. Food was excellent and really just so impressed! Thought it's going to be a typical sports bar and with a large party I thought service would be, well what you usually get.  Food and drinks came out quick, everyone loved those food, and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This my friends is the best restaurant in lake Wylie.. Great staff, cold beer, great food. I have been happy w both my service here and the atmosphere.. Not sure how they pull it off but it's family friendly, which we love, yet it's got a good sports bar feel.. Well done from one business owner to another! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Been to Sweetwater half dozen times over the past year, twice for lunch and four times for dinner. The staff is always cordial, service has been excellent and the food is terrific. On our last visit we had six people after Church, noise level was just right for conversation and we also had a big screen tv close-by so we could see the ball game at the same time. I do not judge a place based on one visit. I look for consistency. With this in mind I am happy to recommend Sweetwater."}
{"text":"This burger was big couldn't even bite it and it was also very good and juicy for well done."}
{"text":"My college roommate and I were having a reunion weekend for the Thanksgiving holiday. No better way to catch up than with a few drinks and some great food for dinner. He told me this place has great burgers, and it sounded perfect. We came on a Wednesday (it was bingo night - looks fun, I'll play next time for sure). Immediately found a seat at the bar - which was perfect. The two bartenders were attentive, funny, and took great care of us.  The menu is diverse and interesting. I got the burger with quest dip, tortilla chips, and guacamole. It was really delicious and fun to try something wild and delicious at the same time. I highly recommend this place for friends, families, anyone looking for a casual, good time at reasonable prices. It's excellent!  **Their manager Sal checked in our meal and was friendly to the regulars sitting near us. We also witnessed Sal handling a situation involving a patron who had been served a little too much. Sal was extremely professional and handled the situation in the absolute best way possible."}
{"text":"This bar and grill might have made me the best Philly cheesesteak that I have had in a while. The cheese was melted perfectly and a generous portion provided. The steak had a wonderful seasoned taste which was highlighted by the fresh peppers and onions. Definitely the best I've had in South Carolina. And the side of fries is enough to feed a family of 4! Along with great wings and cheesesteaks I had a fabulous buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer. Plenty of dip to share, they don't skimp on any portions.  The waitress (I forget her name) was most helpful! The entire staff was friendly and helpful. When trying to decide on one of the many wing sauces samples were quickly offered to give the best description of the sauce.  Next time I plan on arriving after 7pm for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Second visit and it was as equally pleasant as the first time. Plenty of friendly staff and excellent food. Both visits we landed at the bar- bartenders were attentive and suggested excellent menu items. Tonight we enjoy a pound of peel & eat shrimp with a few cold White Zombies and finished with a grilled chicken Caesar salad! Excellent job to both the front & back of house staff! Thanks Dave Rogers"}
{"text":"Love LOVE LOVE this place!! Wings sports amd great drinks!! Wish more would open over town!!"}
{"text":"A consistently great place to eat in Lake Wylie. The service is always good , the food is always good and the place is always packed."}
{"text":"If I didn't have to worry about getting fat I probably eat there all the time. This lovely establishment have daily specials like .60 wings & shrimp on Monday, $2 Tacos on Tuesday and etc. Please visit their website for more daily specials. So far everything I've tried has been so good including their pimento bacon burger. *drool* The oreo milkshake I had was also amazing. The second I started drinking it I felt like a happy little kid and at carnival. I don't know why I picture that possibly because this milkshake has magical abilities to transport you back to the best milkshake you had in your childhood. Anyways... they also have quite good beer on draft and daily drink specials at well. Stop reading! Go and eat well my friends.   Oh yeah, good luck getting in on the weekends! It's packed but a good sign of course :)"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed multiple visits to watch a game or have a few drinks. Nachos are delicious and good beer selection. Place as a whole is very nice as well."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out for football games or just go for dinner with friends. awesome food you have to try the nachos!"}
{"text":"You pull up and see Harley's and think to yourself....\"Self, this is not the place for me\".  Not true, Sweetwater is a solid choice to dine in Lake Wyle.    I've been twice, once for take out and the next time for lunch and we sat on the deck.  Both times Sweetie and I were satisfied with what we ordered and frankly Sweetie won't stop saying that the Ahi Tuna Salad is the best salad around, so there you go.  I had the Chicken Philly sandwich which was good and a grilled chicken sandwich.  I liked them both.  The kids enjoyed playing corn hole while we waited for our food and the service was excellent.  Not many choices in Lake Wylie so I'm glad to have Sweetwater around."}
{"text":"Was in Lake Wylie during stop at Camp Thunderbird and had lunch at Sweetwater.  I had a burger which was gigantic and tasted good too.   They give you a lot of fries. Wife and daughter had the chicken wrap that they enjoyed. Service was good and place looked clean. They have a good following and place was crowded for Sunday  lunch. Not in the area but would definitively stop by again."}
{"text":"Excellent serviice. Hamburger and chicken fingers were very good.  Homemade potato chips had no taste whatsoever unless you dipped into ranch dressing. Onion rings were terrible. Couldn't even chew through them. Other than that nice place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service was awesome, the best I have experienced lately. We started with firescracker shrimp which was good. Next we had shrimp, beef and chicken tacos where only the beef was really tasty as the chicken and shrimp was bland. The flavor of the wings we chose were sizzling jerk and Tangy Gold which were okay. Will try again"}
{"text":"Service and food was fantastic! Good value too...! Server and manager was on top of our table to insure our visit was pleasant. Great philly cheese steak, solid beer selection...we will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot for spur of the moment weeknight date night. We were seated right away and handed an extensive drink list. I initially was going to order the windy hill cider but not looking at the menu closely I am glad the waitress informed me that it came in a bottle large enough for several pints worth. I quickly updated my order to a more reasonably sized legal remedy jalapeño ale. I am too old to get tipsy on a Tuesday!   The reason we came was that I was craving wings to completely negate the time we had spent at the gym. They have over 30 sauces so I was excited when the waitress said I could split my wings between two. I chose the IPA Sriracha and the Bourbon and I added a side of mac and cheese. The boyfriend ordered the lobster mac and cheese fritters to start.  Our beers came out quickly followed not long after by the delicious lobster mac and cheese bites. I must say they are probably the classiest looking food I have had at a bar. I was sad my two didn't have a ton of lobster but I could see my boyfriend chose his wisely and got a better portion.  The regular mac and cheese was amazing. Seriously beautiful and gooey with plenty of cheese. My bourbon wings were perfect but I wasn't a huge fan of the IPA Sriracha. We will definitely be back to check it out as a bar next."}
{"text":"This sports bar has recently opened in the Lake Wylie area.  It was the former Lake Wylie Gator restaurant and bar.  They look to have daily specials, Monday's are $0.50 wings and peel and eat shrimp.  This restaurant / bar also has a good sports bar feel with quite a few TVs.  The menu is made up mostly of bar food like hamburgers, hot dogs, cheese steaks, a variety of sandwiches, salads, appetizers, etc.  I stopped in here with some friends for some food before heading to the shooting range in Clover.  Most entree's run in the $8-$10 range.  The cheese steak with fries is $8.99 and comes with onions, mushrooms, and peppers.  It's a decent steak and a tad bit on the messy side but still not bad.  It came with what looked to be nacho cheese so I probably wouldn't get it again as I like white American on a good cheese steak.  You really don't see cheese steaks with yellow or nacho cheese on them.  One of my friend's had the wings which looked good and like your typical hot wings.  They commented that they were pretty good, but basically your standard hot wing.    All in all this place has pretty decent bar food and one of the better places to watch sports in the Lake Wylie area."}
{"text":"I would have to disagree with Jen B. , I felt everything was priced rather correctly and they have quite a few specials. The place was a pretty typical sports bar in terms of decor and atmosphere.   I had the shrimp basket with fries for $7 ( a special). The fries were super delicious and the shrimp was really crispy (plus they took off the tails : ) ) . I wasn't fond of their cocktail sauce at all, but overall my meal was tasty.  My reason for the -2 stars was our server...who was a tad on the clueless side. I asked for a Magic Hat, but she had no idea what I was referring to until I said number 9 which is fine though they only have 5 or 6 beers on tap. My friend and I asked twice for waters - she managed to get the two men in the group their drink orders just fine. We sat and watched the servers chit-chat while our meal sat in the window, and finally another server was kind enough to bring it over to us. Our server didn't get the two ladies orders correct (forgot condiments and what not), but again managed to get the men in our group exactly what they wanted/needed in a timely fashion.   If I head to Sweetwater again I'd probably be sure to ask for a different server, though I was all around happy with my food."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the food is good, but I think it might be a little over priced for a lunch-time person like myself.  I have been here a few times in the after hours and it is very lively and probably the most happening nightspot in Lake Wylie."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed I read all the reviews an sounded like the wings were the way to go.  I ordered the jumbo wings which they were big . I ordered the sweet baby rays Bbq for my sauce with a side of mild . We ordered the fried mozzarella sticks for our appetizer. They were really good fried hard n good marina sauce I highly recommend them.  I wish I could say the same about the  wings :(  The wings had no taste , they were covered in Bbq sauce . I'm not a hot sauce girl but I like mild well there mild was at least really medium . The fries were okay they are just frozen than fried nothing you can't do at home. My friend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich an she said the same of the mild sauce it was Hottt!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times now and highly recommend it. This is a sports bar with a very friendly and casual environment. On Wednesdays they have bingo and Fridays is karaoke. The waiters and service are fantastic and they genuinely want you to have a great experience!   If you're looking for a great burger then come here."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in lake wylie.  Not a lot of vegetarian choices but you can improvise and they will make it happen. I recommend the southwest chicken salad without chicken or cheese and dressing on the side -- in a wrap!  Yup you can get any salad or sandwich in a wrap.  Try it out.  Also the sauce for the shrimp and grits (Friday regular special) makes everything better! You could pour it on a phone book and make it edible! Try it wth any of the potato sides. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bar food I have ever had.  Wish they would open a place close to me!  Burger was great and shrimp and grits was delicious.  Sides stand out.    I don't frequent sports bars but wish all of them had food this good."}
{"text":"Food was great! We both had the shrimp po-boy and they were very well done. Service was quick and our waitress very responsive to us the entire time. The prices are very reasonable for what they serve. Can't wait to get over there again!"}
{"text":"This is a sports bar with lots of flat screens to watch sports. I had a Grilled Chicken Salad and I had it with Buffalo sauce. The salad was \"ok\", it wasn't bad but it also wasn't one of the better salads that I've had.  The service was good and our waitress was attentive.  All in all it was an average dining experience and I'm not compelled to return to this restaurant.                       PS- I typically add a photo to my post but in this case I omitted it."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way home from the lake and it was overall good! The server was super nice and helpful in ordering. We started with fried pickles which were awesome. It's hard to find them really thin like chips and loved them. We got wings and tater tots. We got the pepper parm, wings were good but didn't care for the flavor. Our friends got Cajun and I loved those.   We have come back several times since and not as great as an experience. Both times our wings had feathers. That gross to me, be sure your wings are properly cleaned. I couldn't stomach eating anymore. I got Cajun garlic and oil, eh not much flavor. The chili flavor was good. If we come back I won't be ordering wings!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Cheesesteak is my fav as well as mac n cheese. I wish they could take over TBones on the lake."}
{"text":"Best club sandwich I have had in a long time! I will definitely be going back. However, parking is a little tight. Hint, don't go at a busy hour."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:01pm and ordered our drinks and food immediately. Drinks came out to us 5-10 minutes after being ordered. After 40 minutes went by, went to the bar to find a manager and was told one would come to our table. The 3 tables that came in after us got their appetizers 50 minutes after we arrived, no manager ever came to our table, and we left after an hour of nothing. Waitress only checked on us once during this hour."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of this restaurant is very disappointing. I became sick after eating dinner there. Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Where the beer is always cold and the service is always friendly. If you're into sports this place has a tv for you. Plenty of friendly faces and you might even see one of the owners, Chris walking around making sure you're happy and well fed. Come here often when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with tons of TV's, good beer selection, good food, and a fun deck.  The food is very fresh, better than most sports bars. Love the wings. They offer a large number of sauces for the wings. The seafood is really good, especially considering how far inland we are.  Hamburgers, wraps and other food are really good.  The noise level is not too loud, even with a packed house.  On the outside deck they gave TV's as well as corn hole games. Great place for lunch or dinner, to watch a game, and to bring the family. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is one of the few watering holes in Clover. They do a great job overall but the menu is pretty limited to mostly greasy food. Great atmosphere, especially outside after work or on the weekends. Friendly staff, local beer + craft beer."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, they have special events and special nights. Wednesday nights are great because they have family bingo, starts at seven and you can win gift cards to use at your next visit. It's a lot of fun food is always great. Huge outdoor space on Thursday nights in the summer and spring they have corn hole tournaments, The tournaments are a blind draw. I believe it starts at 5:30 but if you call you may want to get on a list because there are regulars that have been going there for five years. It's great to watch and open to men and women. As always great service and great food with portions That match the price you pay for them"}
{"text":"Good sports bar. Plenty of TV's. beer selection a little limited if you are looking for darker beers / craft beers. I'm a wings lover and their wings are pretty good. Had the fish and chips on my most recent visit and they were very good.  Great atmosphere.  Only concern, after 8 or 9pm on weekends, the place can get a little rowdy due to people drinking to much and acting like horse's #$%$@#@.  But, the staff seems to handle it.  I would not have my children with me at those hours/days."}
{"text":"Went out for my birthday tonight.  Stopped by Sweatwater after to hang out for a couple hours.  Door said they close at midnight which was perfect.  At 10:40 they announced last call and at 10:45 they turned the music off.  All while 13 people were still in the bar.  Not a good first experience.  Felt like we were an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Great little spot with fabulous, friendly staff and craft beer on tap. The manager (owner?) is very sweet, touching tables to ensure guests are having a great experience. It does get very busy and there have been times where I have had to wait quite a while for my food but there are plenty of televisions to keep you entertained. I find the food to be good -- it always arrives hot and fresh. Check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte this summer, we have done some exploring for local spots. This was our first time to Lake Wylie, and we found Sweetwater on Yelp. The great reviews convinced us to give it a try. The great service, amazing food, and cool style will bring us back consistently. A sports bar with far better food than the traditional dives (fresh hand-pattied burgers!) and a cool bar with a beer selection to impress the most discerning palate (lagers to IPAS to Porters). A must try, if you haven't been...and order the buffalo dip!"}
{"text":"Please please please start showing the UFC. You would have a huge turnout for those that don't want to drive up to Rivergate to watch the fights. Please consider it."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food. Friendly and attentive. Good specials and seafood. I won't eat tuna just anywhere.   Even the jr nacho special is overly generous.   My hub and I get different things all the time and it's always good. Nice patio too. A little noisy due to the proximity to 49 but still nice with fans and shade."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in for a drink and some solid food. I got Nachos, which were huge. Good beer, good drinks, friendly staff. Nice place in lake wylie. I sat at a high top table in the bar area. The place was very busy, but not so much that I had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"So I typically go to Sweetwater every Tuesday for taco Tuesday this is been a ritual for the past three months I have never had Bad food or bad service the service is always prompt and with a smile and the food is always fresh I could not think of a better way to spend my Tuesday afternoons then at Sweetwater I suggest locals do the same. By far I would have to say this is the best restaurant with food and service in Lake Wylie"}
