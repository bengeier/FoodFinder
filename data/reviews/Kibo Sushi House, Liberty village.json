{"text":"Pretty good sushi for the price, I love that you can order online and then pick it up at the restaurant. The price is really fair and the sushi and rolls are really big. I've ordered twice from here already."}
{"text":"Great sushi, fresh ingredients, and relaxing atmosphere. The service was great. The staff was very helpful for choosing menu since it was my first time visit this place. Love to go back this place! Actually I would say this is must go place in Liberty village area!"}
{"text":"New sushi spot in liberty village! Good quality of Japanese food with resonable price! Friendly staffs will welcome you"}
{"text":"Love the Kibo on Spandia as that is the one I usually go to but this Kibo in Liberty Village is a lot  bigger and nicer.  Got the Love boat for 2 which included sashimi, sushi and maki rolls along with a basket of mixed tempura and a bowl of Edamame beans.  Also you get the usual miso soup and salad.  Quality is on par with the other Kibo and always fresh.  Love Kibo sushi and will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to eat here for lunch with my co workers and the place did not disappoint. The service was pretty fast and even though the server gave me the wrong order, they were able to replace it right away in a timely manner. The food was pretty good too especially with their price point, it wasn't expensive and was just the right price for really delicious sushi. Overall, I had a good time with my co workers here and would definitely comeback for lunch with them."}
{"text":"I've never been to a bad sushi spot honestly. This place was conveniently located near my Airbnb in Liberty Village. Was my first time in Toronto and was in the mood for sushi. Service was good, and the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered 3 rolls: spicy crunchy dynamite, French Kiss, and spider maki. Everything was delicious and we were satisfied. Prices not too bad, would definitely come again if I was in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great service. Can't wait to come back again. Specially love boat for two is around 43.95 Comes with miso soup and salad,edamame, Tempura plus sushi sashimi maki boat.. We had wait for little bit and server bring us free chicken kara a ge.. That was amazing.. I love this place !!!"}
{"text":"The tastiest birthday party I had this year! The chef's sushi creations are amazing: fresh, beautiful and delicious. Had Love Boat for 4 less than 100 bucks. More than enough food."}
{"text":"So after a long day celebrating at the annual Caribbean Festival bka Caribana, my girlfriend and I, stopped in this establishment as we both wanted to try sushi while in Toronto. We were pleased to find one so close to where we were staying. Although the service was slow at first the rest of our time there was very smooth and pleasant. This is a good spot to get your sushi fix if in the city as they have multiple locations."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki salmon bento for lunch. Salmon did not taste as fresh...however, I appreciated the details in the rice and soba noodle. I really like the fact that there were sesame seeds and seaweed flakes on the rice - it shows that the chefs put a lot of attention on the dishes. The salad that was provided was also not too bad (I find that a lot of salads provided with bento boxes tend to be mostly soggy pieces of lettuce, shredded carrots and rice vinegar dressing thrown together).   Service could have been a bit better - I didn't actually make my order until 15 minutes after sitting down - I tried to get the attention of the servers but everyone seemed too busy to notice. However, my food arrived really quickly and I got my bill fairly quickly as well so I guess that made up for the initially slow service.  This was just my first impression of Kibo - I am open to coming back to try out some of their rolls. Hopefully the dishes and service would be better the second time around."}
{"text":"Pros: Food Price Design  Presentation  Quiet Freshness Menu design  Selection of food  Cons: Hidden location Tea selection   Summary: Great sushi! Great service and great price!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre place. Replacing Raaw Sushi which was even worse. Maki rolls are filed with ground fish and the spicy versions have too much mayo - can't taste the fish.  The prices are typical for liberty village (i.e. Not cheap). The sushi places on Atlantic Ave and king st are better.  Also, beware in the winter as their door is very slow to close - lots of icy air gets inside (especially since customers don't bother closing the door behind them)."}
{"text":"Do not let the look of the restaurant fool you. It may look run down (in my opinion) but the food is great. They instantly brought out the tea, perfect for a cold night. We got the platter but before the platter; they brought out the miso soup and mini salad. It was filling for two. The server left us alone but too alone, didn't see if we needed anything or has any concern."}
{"text":"Got take out from this place because it is very close to me. We got a chicken teriyaki and I was disappointed that it didn't taste like teriyaki at all and there was not much sauce either. However, the worst was that the sushi combo gave us a stomachache. I wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"First impression, service is bad, they work with a I don't care attitude.  They were chatting on their own, no greetings no thank you.  Rude attitude when I ordered.    I called to ask if they have uni sushi today they said yes so I come.  When I'm here ordering they said yes we have uni but not today.  I treat this as lying!  I would have go to somewhere else to fix my uni crave.    This business has low rating and not much review for a reason.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi I have had in the city. I'll be honest, the first few times that I've had Kibo was from uber eats, but after I moved to the neighbourhood I decided it was finally time to check it out in person.  The place is cute, although I found it pretty cold in the restaurant. All of thebstaffbwrre nice, very attentive without being smothering.  The food is absolutely delicious. I had a number of their rolls, and my goodness some of those rolls are massive! You definitely get what you pay for. The ingredients taste so fresh and the food looks like it is prepared with care. It may be on the pricier side of things but it is SO worth it. I've recommended Kibo to a number of my friends and they are all in love now.  I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time myself the other day to finally try it - I had always walked by, and it was much closer than the one on Atlantic that I frequent quite often.   I came in, and it was very quiet, with only about 1 other table there already eating.  I was attended to very quickly, and decided to order a Philadelphia Roll and had advised that I did not want any Cucumber in the roll.  Waiter said \"not a problem, I'll let them know\" - he didn't write anything down on paper, but why would he... there was only 1 person he was serving, and it was a fairly easy order... right?  Well my roll came, and he said \"there's cucumber on the outside of the roll, but that's just decoration, you don't have to eat that\", and because I do not have an allergy, it was not a problem for me at all.  That is... until I looked in my roll, and saw a TON of cucumber.. almost EXTRA cucumber.  I was pretty annoyed to be honest.  Such a simple request from the ONLY customer your restaurant is serving.  Kind of ridiculous.  I know it's small, and petty, but still.  Anyways, they had to re-make my roll which in which I had to wait another 10 minutes.  To be fair, the presentation was great, and it did taste good, and they DO deliver for orders above $30.00, but if they can't get my 1 request right, on my first time there - I don't think I'll be switching anytime soon from my restaurant on Atlantic.  Food = deserved 4 stars Service = is the reason for 2 Stars"}
