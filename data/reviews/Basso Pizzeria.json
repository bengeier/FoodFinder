{"text":"To be clear: this review is for the Brunch. 

A friend and I were wandering around the area and were looking for a cafe or something to have breakfast at. We were starting to lose hope when we saw an open Pizzeria advertising their brunch. We were a little hesitant but we shouldn't have been. 

We were super pleasantly surprised. The brunch menu is impressive, with several heavily breakfast-y options (eggs, etc) and several lunch-ier options. I got the Peruvian Eggs, which arrived perfectly cooked and with some of the best potato hash I've had in ages. It also came with a pickled slaw which was the perfect set off for the rich eggs. My friend got the pulled pork sandwich, which was also amazing (and generously sized). [The only complaint would be that he would probably have preferred if it was served on a softer - not as crusty - type of bread but that was a minor issue!]

I think this place is maybe a bit off the beaten path for the breakfast lovers but it's amazing and worth the trip. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend last night. We were staying in the Distillery District and were looking for a cute, romantic dinner date place, and ended up having one of the best dinner dates we've had yet!

The staff was so incredibly friendly and genuinely cared if we were having a good experience, from the music to the water to the food. We got the prosciutto and provolone pizza to share (because we've each got tiny appetites), which was delicious and got us stuffed, but when they suggested we try the bruschetta as well, there was no way we could say no to any of their incredibly sweet servers or even the sous chef, who came out to make sure the food was ok!

You can really tell when the people at a restaurant are genuinely invested in caring about providing a good meal, especially when it comes down to the little things. Would definitely come back with friends or with my girlfriend for another date -- if she lived in the city it could easily become one of our regular spots. 

Pizza + bruschetta + two beers (+ complementary dessert!) + tax + tip = just over $50 for two for a really beautiful night out."}
{"text":"We had reservations and they gave away our table.. and then tried to seat us at a table for ants. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Basso pizzeria has very kind service and kitchen staff! We ordered a pizza and lasagna. Since the lasagna was made from scratch it took a very long time to come out, however the chef came to our table and gave us some bruschetta on the house to thank us for our patience. The lasagna was great. The Pizza is pretty standard for an Italian place. Not great, but very traditional. Thin crust, slightly burnt on some edges, fresh ingredients though! 4 stars is being generous but the staff deserves credit for going the extra mile"}
{"text":"The food and service is wonderful. We had the grilled caesar salad, which was to die for, and a very delicious wood over pizza. The place was extremely clean and well decorate. Our server toren was lovely and very entertaining."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim after seeing the sign out front for wood oven pizzas. The place is split in two with the front being a bar with the oven visible and has more of a party atmosphere, while the back has the candle-lit date night vibe, (both other occupied tables were couples as well). 

Service was great and fun to banter with. Got a pitcher of white wine sangria which was the only low point, tasting a little watered down. The pizzas themselves were excellent, I got the prosciutto and provolone. I can't say a lot on the pizzas - they were exactly what was expected but prepared well. I think the size was 14\" - fine to split one as a snack / appetizer, or get your own as a meal. 

This is a good choice if you're looking for a low key date night or upscale pizza and beer night out."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious!  Ordered breakfast pizza and egg benny with avocado and bacon.  The breakfast pizza alone was probably enough food to feed both of us!  Service was super friendly too.  Will come back again and try dinner another time."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Great food!  We eat out several times a week & have never left a review, but this place is worth it.  Not what you would expect in the area, but food was flavourful, made fresh and reasonably priced.  A definite hidden gem!  We had a wood stove pizza, gnocchi, eggplant parm and would highly recommend all!  The Caesar salad is one of the best I've had!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The place is so cute. Especially for this rougher neighbourhood. Tried the Gorgonzola veggie tart late at night. Mushier than a regular tart but amazingly flavourful. Good service. Pastas and pizzas available. Closes at 11 and seems like they serve until closing. Rougher crowd in an upscale bistro. Neat concept."}
{"text":"I have been to Basso twice when I have been visiting friends in Toronto. It is great. First thing you notice is the smell of their wood fired pizza oven and deliciousness. The redheaded waitress is a bubbly sweetheart who seems to understand the idea of hospitality because she recognized us from last time. I ordered their pizza again. It is the sauce that has the great flavour. I loved watching the man make the pizza in front of us. Charming people, great beers and nice, very simple salad."}
{"text":"So we decided to go here for lunch and oh my was it a mistake. We came here for summerlicious and wanted to try this place out because it was fairly new. My appetizer was the caprese tower which was okay. It was a lot smaller than I expected, but the sauce was not bad. The pizza itself was terrible. The sauce was okay, but the pizza was overdone for sure. The bottom of the pizza was burnt, and the crust was so hard, that my jaw hurt after the third slice. They ran out of the fried icecream (which was what we came for) and so we had tartofu.  The dessert was the only enjoyable part of lunch. Even though our servers was really friendly, It took us a painfully long about of time for our food to be served. Additionally, one of the rooms further in the back smelled very odd. 

To sum it up: Bad Pizza, slow service, okay appetizer & dessert"}
{"text":"One of my new favourite local restaurants to go to in Queen East. Warm, friendly atmosphere with a great assortment of beer, spirits and wine. Staff are friendly and engaging as well as knowledgeable. Pizzas are superb: fantastic quality with a traditional thin crust. Pastas are al dente, and the sauces are savory and we'll balanced. Another great thing about this place is the food is made to order, so you can customize your dishes. My most recent visit was for winterlicious: it was incredible! Succulent grilled calamari, homemade gnocchi al Pollo in gorgonzola cream sauce that melted in my mouth, and deep fried ice cream. The dinner was 28 dollars. I was beyond pleased with the quality and value. There's many social events and live music throughout the week. Perfect place for a date night or social night."}
{"text":"Very good pizzas and salad. Very nice service. 
The set up of the place could be better, but everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Great customer service, pizza, chicken wings, and calamari. Found this place on a Saturday since every other restaurant around were closed by 10. We were greeted and seated right away. Food was delicious! We had pizza, calamari, and gnocchi.
Pizza is freshly made in a Brick oven!! Yes, brick oven! You don't find that a lot anywhere. Customer service was also excellent and prompt. Owner was also friendly. This place was so good that we brought family in that same day an hour later and they greeted us with smiles. Come try this place, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Service tried really hard. But execution at this new restaurant still needs a lot of work. First, they should not have anyone sit just below the AC vent. It is too cold/strong for anyone to enjoy a meal. 

They do not serve bread despite having bread plates. Instead they sell garlic bread, which is pizza dough with garlic.

2 of the party ordered the Summerlicious menu. They were out of 2 of the three dessert choices when we sat down at 7( in a pretty empty restaurant )

Everyone was very happy with their food once they got it, but the service needs significant work"}
{"text":"The wood burning oven pizza was very tasty!! I have been a few times but one of my favorites is the Rigatoni ala Vodka and the Beet Salad!! The service was just as great."}
{"text":"This is what a modern Italian eatery should be all about! Great ambience, beautiful decor and a real wood-burning pizza oven. Don't miss this place, the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and wasn't sure what to expect as the menu was small. We had made a reservation, and thank god we did as the restaurant is very small. The ambiance is nice, and the staff are friendly, albeit a little overwhelmed it seems. 

We ordered the calamari (grilled) and it was perfectly cooked over a warm spinach salad. The waiter accidentally brought one fried one out for me, but I told him I had ordered grilled and he quickly went to fix it and left the fried for the table. The meatball was also good, the tomato sauce was delicious and had a nice kick. 

The chicken Parmesan was really good, I usually don't like this dish, but the tomato sauce is what made this dish for me. The sauce was flavourful and had a nice kick to it. The veggies on the side were well cooked too. The gnocchi was good and the sauce was super luscious and tasty.

The deep fried ice cream...AMAZING! it was coated in cake batter and drizzled with berry coulis with caramel and whipped cream. I COULD EAT THIS FOREVER.

We ordered the white sangria, which tastes like juice, but it was still yummy! 

I would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Does not live up to the hype! Based on the yelp review, we were excited to come here and try its winterlicous menu but left hungry and disappointed. 

The food was a letdown. Appetizer: calamari was not fresh, bruschetta bread was stale. Main: chicken limone was undercooked and overwhelmed by capers. Dessert: bread pudding is very stale and hard to bite into (I had better bread pudding at the Firkin bar!) 

Now, the service. The service was very slow despite only having three tables in the restaurant. It took us two hours to get through lunch and the first hour was just waiting. There were a few mix-ups: the pizza arrived before any of the appetizers, the sparkling water we order was frozen, the server brought water for the other table to us by mistake after we asked for the bill. I mean, there were only three tables in the whole restaurant! 

To sum it up, bad food with slow service is not a combo that warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Cozy, friendly wood burning oven pizza, pasta and sandwich place. 

Knowledgeable staff took the time to show us, up close, how the wood burning oven cooked the pizza. 

New owner is excited to make this a community meeting spot with low key entertainment for small venue. 

Great prices and food."}
{"text":"I think....there was a change in management recently. The place looks nothing like in the photos..... it is kinda run down.. there are no table cloths and it looks like a shabby shack.... 

Just from stepping in our group felt taken aback.. like omg where the heck are we... and I was scared to go in to be honest.

We were then told the private dining is at the back so we walked in..it was 30 deg and there was no AC when we walked in and the place was totally empty and broken down. When we sat there were no lights so we were sitting pretty much in the dark with a little sunlight peering in... 

The waiter guy then asked if we want ac and opened it for us.. 

The food took 40+ min and it was decent but... idk it was totally not what the yelp pictures lead on :("}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! I would never go back.  The food was bland and flavorless and don't get me started on the service.  Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed from the beginning and started to break down crying at the table next to us.  Management should of sent her home, but she continued to work her shift.  We waited 45 minutes in between our main before they remembered our dessert.  This was the worst winterlicious experience ever!

My appetizer was the bruschetta and the bread was very stale.  The main was gnocchi and was undercooked.  The dessert was a bread pudding, which was the biggest let down.  It was just a large piece of bread and was hard as a rock."}
{"text":"It's unclear to me how this place has a solid 4 stars on Yelp... I'm wondering if the management has changed recently?

I came here with some colleagues after work, and we were all so excited to try this place as we'd heard great reviews - by word of mouth from friends, and Yelp.  There were so many off-putting things about this restaurant, that I wouldn't return.

CONS: 
*First Impression: We made reservations, and our table was not set or even ready.  When it was, we sat in a dimly lit corner with one of the lights burnt out. 

The waitress was wearing a Netflix n' Chill type outfit and was completely unprofessional.  She wearing tights, a bralette as a crop-top.  I'm not usually judging the restaurant based on clothing, but it took my whole group aback.

*Food:  The food came out extremely late, and half of us were served before the others... even though the restaurant was empty - minus 2 tables just having drinks.

I had ordered a Bianca Pizza (Crust, Proscuitto, Arugula, Parmesan and Olive Oil).  I knew that there was no sauce, but when the pizza was brought out, it was so incredibly dry and crunchy.  I'd expected there to be Olive Oil on it, adding flavour, but I was sadly mistaken.  I had to ask for extra olive oil so that it wouldn't be dry. Benefit of the doubt... maybe it was the pizza I ordered... but I didn't find it very authentic-Italian.

We also ordered Chicken Wings, and we could tell it was it was frozen, and came out of a box. There was no meat on the wing, the sauce was not coated properly, etc. Would not recommend. 

*Drinks: EXTREMELY overpriced for mixed drinks. There were 2 sets of drink menus given to our party of 6, and two of us ordered Sangrias (White Wine) from a menu ($10 each), and when the bill came, the bill said $14 each. When we brought this to her attention, she told us that there was an 'error' and the correct price was on the other Drink Menu... She did not charge us $10 for the sangrias - she kept it at $14... unsure why? So we told her she may want to reconsider handing out both menus to a table that have price discrepancies...

One of us ordered a beer (Beau's) and when asked for a second glass, the waitress brought out a Flying Monkey instead (not a big deal... but it's the little things that count)

PROS:
The menu was quite good - I thought the selection was great (apps, pizzas, pastas, meals, salads, etc.)

Not sure if it's connected, but two out of our group weren't feeling so great after dinner and ended up being so sick, they stayed home today.

*PS: I was so hungry, I forgot to take photos (doh!)"}
{"text":"I brought my son here after school for dinner. The owner is friendly and made him feel special. He went into the pizza prep area and made the pizza that he and I shared. Big menu but I only have the pizza when I visit."}
{"text":"Came in right before closing but owners were nice enough to offer to stay a bit late on the Thursday night to accommodate us. Kitchen was closed, but we were still able to order pizza!

The pizzas are so good! The crust is so very thin so you can really taste the ingredients on it. We ordered the cheese, Italian, and the busso, all of which were utterly amazing.

Calamari was also good. The owner gave us some homemade chipotle dipping sauce to go with it which took it to another level!"}
