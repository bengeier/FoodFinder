{"text":"I found this place randomly while driving through. What a hidden gem! Make sure you try the London Broil. Absolutely astounding. The owners are absolutely wonderful to talk to as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My husband and I go there almost every week.  We had our first date there.  yes I know its not all that fancy, but we are older.  I love the filet flounder.. He always gets the everyday special. The staff is great especially Jean.. Not a bad price. we both can eat for less than 25.00.  I wish a salad would come with the food and not extra.."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a fish camp now that Long Creek is carry out only. Decided to try and am I sorry I did. I ordered the whole flounder and it was fried to a crisp. Was told by waitress that it was the way they serve it but I tried to explain it was burnt to no avail. So one time is enough for me"}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome food, Grilled chicken and Greek salad was a definite winner and my husband had so much food in his serving he had to bring some home. The server was a lovely girl, very prompt and attentive.  Save room for baklava or take it to go. You won't be disappointed! We're definitely coming back here!  Even their fries are better than average."}
{"text":"Omg this was the first place we ate when we was looking to move to the area.. well it was the worst seafood ever I've had better at captain D's I would suggest  Lincolnton seafood you have to get it to go but man it is amazing we love there grilled seafood"}
{"text":"The food is good for a fish camp restaurant. Clean dinning area and friendly staff. It is always constant and priced correctly. Do eat there and will eat there again"}
{"text":"Not a fan. After paying 15.50 for broiled tilapia with a salad and paying an additional 2.50 for vegetables got home to three tiny pieces of fish, small salad with mostly lettuce. I can't believe I wasted my money on what was essentially vegetables and cold tasteless fish. I'll stick with Long Creek where a childs' plate is so much cheaper and there's actually food involved."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Could not ask for anything better!! The broiled jumbo stuffed shrimp is in one word DELICIOUS! And the jumbo broiled shrimp is just as yummy!"}
{"text":"As one who lived in a state that had plenty seafood restaurants and options, it was nice to find a local establishment that gives you that same feel.  The customer service was exceptional and the portions (we ate from the lunch menu) were enormous, definitely a plate for two.  We had the fried options but they also provide grilled options...  Prices are more than reasonable for good, fresh seafood.  We will definitely return when in the area....  TWO THUMBS UP!!!!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I went to grab a bite today since we were both off.   We got the \"pick two\" he ordered fried flounder, and perch with a baked potato. I got the fried perch, and Alaskan white fish.   We also ordered a side of the baby shrimp.   Cole slaw was amazing. Loved it!   I got a sweet potato with mine, and I appreciated how they didn't load it up with sugar and stuff like that. It was steamed perfectly too.   The perch was our favorite, the flounder and white fish were dry & tough.   As someone who doesn't know a lot about fish I wish the menu was a little more clear on the description of the fish. It was hard to figure out what I wanted.   Our server was nice, and prompt with refills, and the food came out quickly.   We will probably make this our stop when going to feed store :)"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Northstar. The fish has NO flavor for me. I have tried this place several times to give it a fair shot. Service is nice and staff are friendly. There's plenty of seating and its a nice atmosphere but because of the poor food quality I had to rate this a one star."}
{"text":"Decent food for fish camp fare.  Not greasy, fairly priced and a clean dining area.  Fried catfish is good and hushpuppies are tasty too."}
{"text":"Great place it was quite it was a lot of good I had leftovers the stuffed shrimp was awesome. The staff was very friendly I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight. The food was  good and plentiful and the Cole slaw was exceptional. I can not say the same for the service however. We had to ask  after sitting for awhile with empty glasses for our drinks to be refilled. The waitress/busboys started cleaning our table before our meal was finished. The owner however did apologize but we aren't sure if we will go back or not."}
