{"text":"3.5 star rating  I moved from about a block away from this place months ago and still hadn't tried it. We were looking for an easy takeout, non-fast food meal so finally decided to try them out.  The interior is actually a bit newer than the exterior may suggest. Nice and clean inside and a few tables for dine-in.  I ordered a veal sandwich with roasted peppers, jalapenos, and cheese; lasagna and a penne with meat sauce.  The veal sandwich was the highlight and something I'll certainly go back for. I can't think of anything negative about it. The meat was crispy and fresh, great roasted veggies and I liked having the option of jalapenos, which were also roasted.  The pasta was just okay, neither here nor there. Pretty good value for it, but from an Italian place (as I understand, it is Italian-run), I would hope for more authentic flavors especially with the sauce which was too sugary. I also saw some pizza by-the-slice, and it also struck me as very North Americanized. If that's you're thing however, give them a try and it's very inexpensive.  I'll certainly return for the sandwich and I saw that they also do churrasquierra chicken. The staff said they don't cook much at a time, in order to ensure freshness, so I hope that will be my experience. If so, it would provide another great takeout family option and save me a trip to the further (but ever so good) Nova Esperanca.   A fairly positive experience and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Value: got the 1/2 chicken dinner and frankly, its bigger than what I get from the churrasquierr dowm main street (near TD). Paid less than $10  Taste: chicken is moist, rice is tasty, their hot sauce is alright (kinda reminds me of Frank's. Not spicy enough but its okay)  however, the potatoes are really nice.  in comparison to other places ive had it at, this is the most seasoned  Service: really friendly staff. Quiet takeout atmosphere. Fast service as well.  Maybe next time ill try out their sandwiches"}
{"text":"First off,  Chris B a few reviews down is way too critical of this cozy lil establishment.  Pomodoro is pretty good, but also costs an arm and a leg.   Now with that out of the way,  I would recommend this restaurant for  folks that like authentic Italian food and flavours. Their prices are reasonable for the portions you receive.  I've had their pizza as well as veal parm and both were full of flavour and really filling.  Not once have I've been disappointed and I've eaten great tasting food all over the world.    Highly recommended stopping by and trying out some of their menu."}
{"text":"I tried San Francisco Place when they first opened and loved it. The staff (owners I think) were just great and so was the food. It became my go-to Italian place for a while until on one visit my food wasn't the same. The panzerotti was actually cold inside (???) and the sandwich didn't seem fresh. That visit was close to closing time so that might account for the one \"off\" visit, but it was enough to have me go elsewhere next time... and since.  I may give them another chance and do attribute this as a one-off, but note to business people out there, being off once just can be off-putting enough."}
{"text":"This place just opened up across from Dairy Queen at Queen & Center street.  I've only been twice but the proprietors are very very nice people, it's an Italian couple who's son is sometimes there to help out.  I've tried the pizza slices, chicken parmesan sandwich, and a penne paste in tomato sauce and all 3 have been tasty.  Very garlicky too, so I hope you're a fan!  I want to see this place do good because they're very nice people making better food than the fast food options in the area, so I wish them good luck!  Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"The young woman in the front always has an attitude. The food used to be great but the past couple of times I've gone they've been closed at random times when it clearly says they're open. They haven't had commercial n items the past couple of times either. Like burgers, chicken or veal. I'm over this place, won't come back here. After my experience today of them not having veal I went to Sonny's down the street and it's my new favourite place!"}
{"text":"Edit: On the strength of their sandwhiches I added another star. The pizza is still lousy though but still lots of reason to check them out.    They recently underwent a change of management but unfortunately the pizza did not get any better in the transition. It's about on par with some of the better supermarket frozen brands.  They've started selling home made burgers which are actually one of the better items on the menu (funny since it's supposed to be an Italian joint)  In the immediate area you could do worse however there are far better pizza places in Brampton.  Check out Tony and Jim's Place on Flowertown Ave instead."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I caught them on an off day but the first thing when I walked in it took them a few minutes to even notice I was there.  I ordered an panzerotti, it was HUGE. I was so excited to eat it only to find that half way thru the pan-z all I was eating was dough. Tbh, I'd rather them serve me a pan-z that was half the size with the same amount of ingredients. It was like a huge dissapointent"}
{"text":"We always order our pizza from here.  It's the best pizza in the area.  Owners are great"}
