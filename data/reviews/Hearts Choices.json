{"text":"Friendly staff. Thai green and yellow curry are my new go-to comfort food. Hand -made quality Food. dessert square seemed a little heavy on the coconut oil, don't think I would orde it again, but will be back to try othe menu items soon!"}
{"text":"So good! Vegan Thai cafe in the middle of nowhere. I got the Sweet and Spicy veggies and Green Beans & Tempeh. One with white rice and the other with their brown rice option, both awesome. And of course I also got a cupcake + cheezecake!"}
{"text":"This café has lots of potential. The food was delicious! We tried the green curry and sweet ginger tofu with rice and side salad. The curry was the right kind of spicy, and the tofu was served in a delicious ginger broth. Unfortunately, I think it was an off day when we were there; they had run out of two different kinds of rice for the people in front of us. As well, sitting next to giant freezers of product doesn't exude a cozy feeling. 

The service was decent, and the food was excellent. It's just off the mark a little in terms of aesthetics - which, to me, can be important. 

I will definitely be back, if just for a round of vegan cashew Brie!"}
{"text":"Great place, I love my pre-made frozen items that I purchase from the Calgary Farmers Market better than going to the restaurant but in a pinch I would go in for sure to pick up a yummy healthy lunch. Very friendly staff and food is always good."}
{"text":"Yet another cute little local shop by my house.
I've never dined in, but have bought their  take home items. 
Always good quality and the staff are friendly and kind. 
If you, like me, want to reduce the amount of meat you eat, you will enjoy the TVP based GMO free \"meat\" products Hearts Choice makes in house.
Even my carnivorous boyfriend loved the taste and texture of the Ginger Chicken and Pepper Steak."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I've eaten here twice and plan on coming back. The service is amazing, coming with recommendations and assistance to help you get the best taste out of an amazing dish. With a quaint, relaxed, and peaceful atmosphere, this café manages to satisfy your stomach, taste buds, and wallet. Even if you're not vegan, I recommend trying this place out. It will satisfy meat eaters and non-meat eaters alike!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat Vegan food but one thing .. Pad Thai is a really missed for $11 so dot order but other dishes r good"}
{"text":"On my second visit, I became a fan. Now, we've been three times and it is a place I would bring friends. We are not vegan, however, we enjoyed the food. On our third visit we had the cupcakes....they were delicious!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is amazing. They have a lot of choices. I had picked one dish and a few moment later another dish had become available the man behind the counter suggested I change my order to that. It was an incredible dish. They also have a small freezer section with tofu and juices. Their hours are also very convenient."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in the Calgary food scene, my wife and I frequent Hearts Choices as their dishes are pretty much prepared to order. The quality of the food is consistently excellent (legitimately South-Asian flavours). We enjoy the service from the staff, who is helpful and always in good mood.

While there, we also load up on vegan groceries to bring back home. Even though we are not vegan ourselves, the imitation meats that they sell are some of the best we've ever tried - even better than the real thing.

The only downside is that they are closed on Sundays, and living downtown, we are usually able to go on weekends, but hey... there's always next Saturday to come back...!"}
{"text":"They know what they're doing when it comes to food and spices and overall flavour of what they're making. Yum! I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Nan is an ALL-STAR! I am on a fairly intense liver cleanse leading into a food elimination regiment right now and she did such an amazing job helping me out!
I told Nan what I wasn't able to have (which is pretty much everything) and she have a great meal whipped up in about 15 minutes and I will be going back whenever I'm close cleanse or not.
LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints with their meals and portion sizes. Staff and extremely welcoming. We look forward to stopping in whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"The price is correlative with the quality of food and of service! I love this place! Best place in Calgary to eat and I am not even vegan."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. We ordered the satay, egg plant stew, green curry and blueberry vanilla cheese cake. They were all very good. What I like most about this place is that they are generous to leave the condiments out. I love the deep fried garlic and different kinds of hot sauce. The chef is Japanese, pretty cool that she can cook such good Thai food."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Generous portions and great selection. Had Pad Thai and a few combo options. Thai iced tea was better than any original."}
{"text":"Ok - let me start by stating I'm not a Vegan nor vegetarian.   So this review is from someone who doesn't eat this food often.  Nor someone who enjoys eating a lot of vegetables.

But......it was incredible!!  The joint is a wee bit hidden away but it's worth the find.  We had green curry, yellow curry, ginger chicken, and satay.  The flavours were amazing....the rice super fresh....side salad was delicious.   The kids meal came with a little soup that rocked!  Great flavour.

The staff was super friendly and helpful!  They helped us work our way through what would be best.  So nice!!!

They even have a great selection of frozen, take home items.  I would have loved to take some with us but it won't survive the drive home.

We absolutely loved this place.  Wish we had it in BC.  A definite mark on the map for wicked Thai food!!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of eating here not once but twice.  The food is bland and tasteless and very over priced and the parts of the food preparation areas I could see looked dirty and unhygienic.

The lack of meat dishes and the fact that I was forced to listen to an employee lecture me about the \"dangers\" of gmo products for 5 minutes is not something I am interested in experiencing ever again.  If you enjoy being fed bland food from people who think vaccines give you autism and eating a steak is murder then you will enjoy this place, otherwise you are better off staying away."}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious!! The yellow curry is the best I've ever had. The staff are friendly and welcoming to those who aren't familiar with vegan food."}
{"text":"This place blew my mind! Let me start with the staff:oh so friendly people,very welcoming and helpful.the food: i cant believe im eating vegetarian food that taste so good.i love the salad that comes with the combo,the chicken satay is faux chicken but its moist.i love the peanut sauce!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular both for takeout at the cafe (it's all good, but try the specials) and their frozen foods here and at the farmers market. Nan and co. are wonderful humans who make delicious food."}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious food and a wide variety of vegan grocery items. Worth coming back for the salad dressing alone!"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious, high quality and fresh. One of the owners, Nan, is one of the friendliest people I have ever met, and is clearly passionate about what she does. It means a lot to me that she will remember little details from the past times I have come in. I haven't seen her recently though, because Hearts Choices has expanded to another restaurant and a food truck!

My boyfriend, who is a stringent meat eater and almost refused to go in there for that reason, was obsessed with his pad Thai. Everything I have eaten at the restaurant is reasonably priced and amazing! I have taken home many frozen items and I can't seem to keep them in my freezer very long! 

Thai Vegan Café is a local business worth supporting."}
{"text":"Really great thai. I haven't really explored the Calgary thai scene so I was very happy that the first thai restaurant I try turns out to be amazing. 
My sisters and I tried the green curry, yellow curry, Tom Kah Pak, and the sweet ginger tofu. Everyone had their favourite, but mine was the yellow curry with coconut rice.

I'll be back to order more! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Environment: This is a restaurant / vegan convenience store. The restaurant itself is plain jane. Very clean place and smells amazing! They sell already prepared vegan dishes that you just need to heat up or microwave (I always buy when I go because it is very affordable and delicious). 

Food: The food is always delicious. I have yet to try all the dishes but so far I have no complaints. I am a meat-a-tarian, but ever since being introduced to this place, I feel like I can go Vegan if I continue to eat here. The cook is very skilled and she has lots of delicious vegan dishes for you to try! 

Service: The owner/cook is very lovely! She is one of the reason I keep coming back to this restaurant. She will go out of her way for customers to make you feel at ease and try/sample the newly cook dishes she has prepared."}
{"text":"I've loved Hearts Choices, ever since Nan stopped me in Calgary Farmers Market, and asked if I wanted to try a sample of her homemade green curry. They sold the curry and their handmade (hail) seitan frozen, so you could take it with you and have a food coma in the privacy of your own home.

Still, I always wished that I could just sit down and have a bowl of curry right then and there. Especially since the other vegan options in CFM left much to be desired.

You have no idea how excited I was when I read on twitter that they were going to finally open their own restaurant. Vegan options in the city are severely limited and require much research. We have vegetarian restaurants, vegan-friendly restaurants, a vegan restaurant that was forced to start selling meat so they wouldn't go under, and a bi-monthly vegan buffet at a Monastery. The selection is not that great, but the market is definitely there, because every single one of the aforementioned is always packed with long lineups and wait times.

I walked in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, and they were already doing steady service. You order your food at the counter and they call out your name when it's ready to be picked up. One of my favorite things about Hearts Choices, is that Nan and her husband; Eahly, always remember me. Even with my new hair!

They have combo specials that come with rice and small salad. I ordered the spicy Thai Green Curry, and a Som Tam (green papaya) salad. Most of their offerings are GF, minus the seitan skewers. I upgraded to coconut rice for an extra 75¢, because coconut rice is probably one of my favorite things in life. 

I also got some of their coffee, which is grown in Northern Thailand and is made to order, so it's good enough to drink black. It comes in a french press and a little timer. When the timer goes off, you can push the plunger down and enjoy your coffee. The guy they have working alongside them behind the counter cheerfully told me all about it, as well as how to eat the Som Tam.

The Green Curry did not disappoint. It's just as good as it's ever been, full of lemongrass, ginger, and spicy coconut-y goodness. Coconut on all the things, please. The portion size seems small at first, but it's served with a generous portion of coconut rice and Som Tam, and the broth is so rich, you probably wouldn't want more than what you get. The Som Tam was so refreshing and paired really well with the main. The green curry and Som Tam pack a bit of heat to them, so if you're sensitive to spicy foods, you can try their yellow curry, which I overheard is their best seller.

Off to the side, they have freezers filled with all the things they carried at CFM, so if you were having trouble deciding what to order at the counter, pick one to stay, and take your second choice home with you. Along with frozen versions of their menu, they also carry homemade tofu, tempeh and seitan. Everything that's GF is carefully marked, so theres tons to choose from. They also stock vegan snacks like coconut bacon made by Phoney Baloney, and vegan chocolate made with rice milk. If you spend over $20, they give you a discount.

Will absolutely have to come back. So glad this place exists in Calgary. So glad it's run by two amazing, kind and generous people that deserve all of their success and more. I'm so full of food that I want to take a nap right now, but I still can't wait to come back with all of my friends."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Hearts Choices for a few years and always have a good supply of their faux meat products in my freezer at home. I was thrilled to hear they had decided to open a restaurant, and finally have the pleasure of eating there this evening. The service is AMAZING, they are super helpful and even offer samples of food if you are unsure of the flavors. I ordered the yellow curry and the \"chicken\" skewers - SO GOOD. The skewers were cooked to perfection in a lovely marinade! It also came with rice and a side salad: I really enjoyed the salad dressing - slightly vinegary and incredibly delicious! I am going to tell all my friends about this place, and if you're reading this review, you should go too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to get some Thai. Chef was very sweet to my mom, who doesn't handle spicy food. Thanks for the recommendation yelp!"}
{"text":"We recently tried this restaurant and we absolutely loved it!! We can't stop telling our friends how great it is! Not only was the food amazing, but we loved that the owners were so involved with each customer. We loved that it was a family oriented place and  that took the stress of eating out with a baby away. For that reason alone we will be back often!! 
Thanks again for the great experience
Ps-the apple and beet salad was amazing, also everything else we ordered :) can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I don't generally go for vegan food. Not because I dislike it, but mostly out of habit. My family is full of meat-eaters so I have meat with almost any meal. However I did want to try this place because of a recent trip to Thailand had sparked a love-affair for Thai cuisine. 

The food: I got green curry and satay skewers with coconut rice. Everything was delicious! The green curry was just the right amount of spicy, full of veggies and the right consistency. Great with the coconut rice. The satay skewers were interesting. I like the taste but it wasn't nearly as impressive as the curry. It also came with a side salad, but I found that the salad was a understated side dish to these marvelous creations. The aroma and presentation were wonderful! (Even for takeout!)

The atmosphere: it's a small place with a few tables and chairs. The décor includes pictures of Thailand on the walls. Even though it is simple and small, it really suits the place. The menus are all hand written and subject to change, which I loved! 

The price: a fair price for all the food. Not fast food cheap; but you pay a fair price for good quality food. 

Overall: Try it. Just do it. Even if you don't like vegan food. It's so delicious that you'll forget it's vegan. It was as close to authentic Thai as I've ever had in Calgary. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I'm a raving meat-aholic. A meal with out meat just seems like watching football without beer - Pointless. And then I walk into this place and like Will Smith, my life got flipped-turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I fell in love with the Thai Vegan Cafe - Heart's Choices.

Their food alone is 5-stars, but we'll get to that in a minute, because the best part about Hearts Choices are the owners, Eahly and Nan. They fill their business with real love. I think the name, \"Hearts Choices\" has less to do with the health benefits of vegan food and more to do with the feeling you get by supporting this business.

Ok, you hyenas - here's the DL on their food:

Their Mock-Meat! I would never turn down a plate of chicken satay, but I honestly wouldn't take the real deal over a plate of Heart's Choices Mock-chicken Satay. I picked up the Satay plate for around the $10 mark. The chicken (not chicken) skewers are tender, moist and have a consistency a lot like dark meat chicken. The peanut sauce is out of this world, and I want to slather it on everything. I want to put it in my morning coffee and do shots of it on a Friday night with friends. The plate comes serves with some thinly sliced, slightly pickled cucumbers. To make the meal a little bit heavier, I picked up a side of coconut rice. This is a smart choice if only solely because you can use the rice to mop up the rest of the peanut sauce on the plate.

There's a million stores in these strip malls, and you won't be able to see it when you're driving by on Macleod. Turn in to the Chapters parking lot and it's directly across the lot. You'll see it. Go. Now."}
{"text":"Hearts choice is a great place for all to enjoy, not just vegans. Creative menu and great service. Great place for picking up some frozen ready made meals as well. Have never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Calgary. It has some of the best vegan food I've ever had, and I moved here from Vancouver. I've tried half a dozen different dishes and they've all been incredible. The staff is all very friendly and if the owner is around, she'll come by and make sure you're enjoying your meal. She might even tell you why she created it for the menu. 
Whether you're a vegan or just want some real, healthy food, this unassuming little cafe is hard to beat."}
{"text":"So nice to have a whole vegan cafe!

Just knowing that no one was tortured or terrorized for that food makes it already several steps up in my book. 

The jackfruit poutine is not to be missed. I sometimes dream about that in between times when I get to eat it. Also the tacos are great. If you're vegan, you'll love it no question. If you're not vegan, it is an excellent, eye-opening intro to just how yummy vegan food can be!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan. I love the satay and the green curry. When they have the jackfruit burger available, that's my husband's go-to. They give free vegetable soup to kids, and my three little ones love the pad Thai (the staff split it on to three plates for us). Service is always great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. You can also buy their products at the Blackfoot farmers market. Really nice couple that own it. My husband who only ever craves red meat and potatoes loved their food!"}
{"text":"choices is a terrible xhain.  everything prepared already and sits in their fridge.  been to several choices locations inside malls and rona etc.  all terrible.  go to supermarket instead"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but I love this place! I'd call it a little hidden gem. Their Thai curries are super flavourful and full of veggies. I've also tried the Pad Thai with vegan \"meat\" (made with soy) and it was great! I loved that it came with fresh shredded carrots on top and the \"meat\" was surprisingly delicious. The restaurant itself is quaint and efficient. You simply order and pay at the front and they call your name when the food is ready. The prices are also pretty good. My meals there have been between $12 - $15. Can't wait to go back and try more of their offerings and pick up some frozen curries to make at home!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place. As soon as she said me the restaurant name, I searched out for the menu on the website.. The name says pure vegan food but I was shocked to see non-veg items on the menu. 
The time has come and we landed at this place for dinner. I cross checked if the menu still had those non-veg items. Yes they did. I could not hold my curiosity and asked if it was a vegan restaurant then why did they have non-veg items on the menu. There was a friendly reply saying they are vegan food but they resemble non-veg food . We ordered cashew ginger \"chicken\", satay skewers, and green curry with fresh mint tea.
We were asked to self serve the food plates and I brought them over to the table and started tasting with mixed thoughts.
Oh really! Can a vegan food be made so well resembling non-veg with no compromise in taste. Wow! If we can get a feeling of non-veg with vegan food then why not stick to veg which is still healthy. 
Props to the idea of hearts choices. 

Also the owners are so friendly. 
For sure a place to visit again.

Why 1 less? 
Answer : because of the ambience and the table was a bit small for the plates . might be silly but it matters.. 

tip: don't forget to add fresh mint tea to ur order. it could easily serve 4-5 people."}
{"text":"A++++!! Absolutely loved this place. It's nothing fancy but the food is on point. Since turning vegan, you realize there's not many options for eating out. Service was very friendly. I got the yellow curry with coconut rice and salad. Everything was amazing. The side salad was seriously so good I had to ask what the dressing was. They let me know you can buy it (which I did)!  My husband got the pulled \"pork\" sand which (made with jackfruit). His had a side salad and some chips. I had a few bites, and you could not tell it wasn't pork. Plus amazing flavor and the bun was soft and warm. 

A lot of their \"meat\" alternatives have soy and I can't eat soy. That would be the only thing I think that disappointed me but the rest was FANTASTIC!!"}
{"text":"Wow haha

This makes you wanna become a vegan. This place is amazing 5/5 100% 
You can enjoy your fav dish and get some good Kombucha on the side ;)"}
{"text":"I'm so stoked on calgary's growing vegan community, and i'l try and support any vegan business I find. BUT! It's not a chore to support Hearts Choices- they are just plain delicious! I've been to each of their locations and left with a full tummy, a happy heart, and an armfull of Vegan junk food snacks for later- hey, I'm not dead, and sometimes you just want some damn (non dairy cruelty free) cheezy poofs! 

If you like thai food you will enjoy it here, but they also have a great burger and a case full of awesome baking! Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"I discovered them at the blackfoot market.
Our experience expanded when we went to their restaurant....
Now they have a food truck?!! My mind is blown how great their food is and Im so happy to see more vegetarian/vegan restaurants growing.

Love your food!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. We had the Pad Thai and it was decidedly not good. The noodles were mushy and glutenous, the vegetables were way over done and completely soggy. We asked for spicy but there was no heat whatsoever. The tofu was slimy and didn't absorb any flavours. 

It seems they have a lot of regulars and so we felt a bit like outsiders and weren't greeted with the same excitement as the other people visiting. I wish we had tried a different dish, as the all the great reviews can't be wrong. But for the price and the fact we had to clear our own table, I won't be back to give them another try."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. If you are a vegetarian and ever come to Calgary make sure you come here. 
Excellent service and excellent food. 
I ordered stewed eggplant and Thai green curry. It was yummy. On our request they made it extra spicy and it turned out great. 
Nan the owner is such a sweet lady. I will always come back here whenever I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"Love the food, and the freezer to grab meals to go. Most things here are also GF and they have them clearly labeled. Win win."}
{"text":"I did not go to this location. Hearts choices has a veggie truck too. Today they were in bridgeland along with a few other trucks. 

This is the porkless pulled pork and some cheesy fries. The \"cheese\" isn't cheesy like string cheese, it's almost like a creamy thick sauce on top of the fries, but it was still good. The pulled pork was good, I've never had the real thing before so there was not much I was able to compare it to. They had put a bit too much mustard for my liking, but that can easily be adjusted. 

I also got spring rolls and the sauce they gave with it was amazing. I think it may have been Thai sauce i am not sure. It was a mixture between spicy and sweet. 

All in all, the prices on the stuff were good for the amount you're given. The employees were extremely nice and fast."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Very friendly staff and a very comfortable atmosphere. The food has so much flavor you wont even miss the meat."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in North America and its VEGAN!!!

It's a family owned and operated restaurant and they are very careful in making sure that you're happy (although the food speaks for itself in that regard).  They are very friendly and outgoing.

The food is amazingly well flavored.  Nothing is bland.  We tried several dishes and shared them.  You can go from spicy to mild and everywhere in between.  They will even let you try a small sample of the soup before buying it.

I would highly recommend to anyone interested in healthy and delicious Asian food."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things and was finally in the right part of town to make it in for lunch! SO very tasty, friendly staff and wonderful atmosphere. It makes me feel like I'm back in the West Kootenays of BC with a wonderful sense of community and great vegan fare."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian options. They have a booth at the farmers market and every time I'm there I buy a bunch from them. They sure know how to make good grub; yum yum!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Heart's Choices - wow! What an amazing find!

Friendly staff are there to help you find something delicious. The owner is as kind as she is knowledgable...

Best of all, you can take all these delicious vegan ingredients home with you to cook amazing meals in your own kitchen!

I am excited to become a regular here."}
{"text":"Amazing! I stopped in for a quick lunch with business colleagues who are meat eaters. We had amazing meals with incredible service. I cannot wait to return to Calgary so that I can eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit this place twice now and was not disappointed. While it is nowhere near me, we have found a couple of opportunities to head south and stop in. 

I managed to buy some to go food from there to stock my freezer for days when I have no time to cook from scratch myself. We even picked up some Vegan marshmallows. There are some great sauces, vegan bacon, pakoras and even \"meat\"balls. 

Made to order, the food is tasty and the service is friendly and quick. I'm just happy to have something vegan other than The Coup now. Pricing is a little on the higher side, especially if you're a meat eater...but you have to understand that vegan food, when processed, takes a lot of effort. 

Was busy both times I was in around dinnertime. The menu is vast and a little overwhelming so if you know what you like for Asian-style fare you'll be better off than a vegan/non Asian food eating newb."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Delicious food, great people, friendly service and great message! 

I have nothing but wonderful compliments for this cafe! Try the French-pressed coffee! 

Do your self a favour and come eat here!"}
{"text":"It would have been five stars but the portion did not match the price, unfortunately, for what I ordered. My experience was a three-star rating but since I have only visited once I will give the benefit of the doubt and that is four stars.

I'm happy that there is a vegan restaurant in the south and perhaps one day I will give it another try. And I will try again for a couple of reasons: The food was delicious, it's vegan, and my hope is that the business thrives.

But a Pad Thai for $12 that is a small appetizer size at best was disappointing. Maybe I ordered wrong! I'll say that. 

I hope that I am more satisfied next time. Maybe I was spoiled in Montreal where a pad Thai would last me two meals. Piping hot and delicious. For eight bucks. 

It was lovely that the owner called me by name when I left to say goodbye :))"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian this place just has really good thai vegan/vegetarian food. Their coconut rice is great and worth the upgrade. Their spicy green curry has lots of flavour and good spice to it. A little pricy but maybe that's what it costs for vegan food? The satay skewers are great and you barely notice they aren't meat. They have little snacks and frozen stuff as well in their store and at the farmers market."}
{"text":"Amazingggg vegan food and even better service! Super friendly and nice people who work there. Best vegan food in the city."}
{"text":"Just ate at the NEW location...first time for me at this place. Ordered the French dip sandwich and it was great!!!!  I would suggest that the dip be a little more robust...perhaps a day long simmered garlic broth...this tasted like a veg cube was used.

I would also like to suggest that the person taking the orders at the counter be used to bring out the food to table. i owned a cafe in Fernie and people came to the counter and ordered and then we brought them their meals/drinks. The person at the counter is a waste of resources just standing there when no one is ordering. Adds another element of service if food can be brought to the table and the client does not have to be focused on staring at the counter to see if it is their order that is up. Just a thought?

Also...When my partner and I go out for a meal...and spend the amount of dollars that the dishes here are charging...we like to have a little more atmosphere...music??? Not just the loud drone of the fridge/freezer. Maybe some art on the walls? Some warmth? When I go to a place like Earls or Ciantis...where the average price per plate is $12/14...I get atmosphere. I want a DATE NIGHT...when I go out. I expect that for dinner...and for lunch...the prices are bit steep...I will spend more money at dinner than for lunch.  The ambiance here was cold and cafeteria style...
 One last thing..about datenight...To order a burger/fries/poutin etc and to be able to have a BEER too...hehe...just a thought

Back to the food...it was very very very good!! Thank you!"}
