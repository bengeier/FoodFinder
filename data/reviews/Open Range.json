{"text":"We attended a private event with choices limited to strip loin, chicken breast, and trout.  We sampled them all, and couldn't find fault with any of them, yet the chicken breast was our favorite. Yellow beets with rice pilaf were a treat. Service was very friendly and attentive. Definitely plan to return on our next trip to Calgary"}
{"text":"As a lover of all things meat, most steak houses are on my radar in one way or another.

Unfortunately, Open Range had eluded me up until recently.  Honestly, I didn't know it existed.

A friend suggested we give it a try because it was nearby.  No preconceptions, no real knowledge of the menu  or the quality.  Just a random recon visit.

Now, as this was more of a casual get together, we opted for a table on the \"lounge\" side of the restaurant.  But as it turns out, the lounge could suffice as \"the restaurant\" at most places.  Nice ambience.  Quiet, and intimate. Perfect for couples to sit and talk.

The server made a good first impression by being quite wine-knowledgeable, choosing an excellent pairing for our meals.  Also, of note, they offer free corkage on Wednesdays . . . .

Additionally, she pointed out that the restaurant has a \"Porterhouse Project\" underway - in which they have resurrected this magnificent cut.  Most restaurants would much rather carve it into two and sell the cuts separately.   I say \"most restaurants,\" but I mean I can't remember the last time I saw it on a menu.

 I can respect that Open Range chooses to sell this bad boy as God intended it.  And they have now made it a permanent option, apparently, so THANK YOU Open Range!

I WAS intrigued by the \"Stuffed Sirloin\" on the menu, however, so I had to try it.  
My friend went tenderloin. 

A couple of appetizers including their take on escargot (which was outstanding) and we were underway. 

Start to finish, the plates were very good.  They stood out because they weren't exactly what I was expecting - they were better.   Unique and delicious. 

Absolutely, I will return.   And next time, the porterhouse is going down."}
{"text":"My bf's brother and sister in law know the owners here. In fact, the owners helped cater their wedding. The food here is amazing. I had the alberta lamb shank and it was 'fall off the bone'. So tender, juicy and full of flavor. My bf had the beef tenderloin and it was delicious. Well prepared and full of flavor. The service was great too. It is a bit pricy here but it was well worth the money. The lamb shank was $27 but I took home enough leftovers for 2 more meals. The total bill for 4 adults and 2 kids came out to $228 not including tip but like what I said...well worth the money. Bf and I went to Nicks Steakhouse a few days earlier and WAS NOT impressed especially with the amount od money we spent. My bf paid $68 for his entree (they failed to tell us lobster tail add on was $30 and prawn add on was $12.99) and I paid $38 for mine. It wasnt as good as Open Range."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that if I opened a restaurant it'd be something like this. The large lounge area is softly lit and has wingback chairs. The main dining room has a variety of beautiful wood tables, gray walls, agrarian vignettes, and Western animal themed art for sale by local artists. The service was slightly formal but friendly, and the wine menu both well-stocked & cheeky. The drinks menu was great, we had several inventive cocktails and they were all delicious. They also carry Bríó beer, which is a rare refreshing and fruity Pilsner from Iceland.

The food menu consists of a dozen or so appetizers, 4 salads, and ~20 meat based dishes in the $23-35 range including everything from elk to bison. We ordered the prime rib, the boar chop, and the duck breast. Each plate was very substantial, coming with a number of tasty sides. The haricots were crisp and tasty, the carrots al dente, the twice baked potato delicious with corn and cotija, and all the meats were great. These are mains worth their price compared to many similarly priced but precious plates at other fine dining spots in town. 

I would be remiss not to mention the herbed red fife sourdough loaf baked with fontina and garlic. This appetizer goes well beyond any \"cheesy bread\" you might get in a lower class spot, using great hearty Sidewalk Citizen bread, an amazing pesto, and a clever presentation wherein the cheese is hidden in the vertical cuts and the whole thing is showered with micro greens. Definitely start your meal with this.

For dessert, I tried the free form goat cheese cake with chocolate lavender sauce. A very unique and adult way to end a meal. If I had any room left I might have tried some of their great dessert drink suggestions, including a Guinness float. Overall, Open Range gets fine fining right with well composed, delicious food that's good value ... 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place never fails! 
I brought my Mom here as an out of tower and she was so impressed with the escargot, the duck, and the delicious signature cocktails we enjoyed.
If you want to impress someone with a delicious meal but not a snobby environment this is the best place. Staff was very friend and could still accommodate us being 20 minutes behind schedule (we called and they said they'd make it work- and they did) 
Excellent - I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the Bison steak and it was fantastic. Started out with the French Onion Soup, made from scratch, and had some local craft beers.  Ate in the lounge, which had enormous chairs that made you feel like a king.  Great waitstaff. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Visit the restaurant in my last day of the Banff trip. The Rib Eye was AMAZING, period. Thick cut, more than an inch thick, yet soft and juicy inside. This is really a perfectly cooked steak, maybe by far the best cooked steak I had in my entire life because the thickness of the steak makes it much harder to cook it perfectly. The Rib Eye was covered by caramalized brown sugar, which is different than the traditional salt and pepper. and I like this way on cooking the steak, as it counters the greasiness of the rib eye.

We tried the onion soup, calamari and foie gras mousse. The appetizer were decent, and pleasant to taste bud."}
{"text":"Likely the best food i have had in Calgary.... but do not go there if you have plans later in the evening or want to be in and out quick.  What started as \"going for oysters\" ( yes-- you can order them from the Big Fish menu) turned into a 5 course, 3 hour magnum opus.  

I had the lamb chops, which for $38.00 first made me a little stressed...until I saw that it was FOUR chops. Great portion size for someone whose husband is a big eater.  Try and keep room for dessert because it was fantastic!

All of the menu items looked amazing ( assuming that you like wild/ game meat) and the staff was wonderful.  We were there during a very busy night where half the restaurant was booked for a Christmas party and they did their best to stop by to make sure we had bread/ drinks."}
{"text":"We were invited here with friends a few weeks ago, and were excited to try it as we hadn't yet even heard of it! The wine menu was quite good, and everything we ate was using amazing quality ingredients (which is why our friends wanted to introduce us to this restaurant).  My only complaint is that every dish was quite over-seasoned - and although the food was very good, for the price, I wanted it to be outstanding.  The service was great, and the interior itself is gorgeous. I would probably recommend it to others, but there are certainly better places to go in the city."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had this year. Enjoyed the atmosphere as it was quite which allowed our table to have great conversation with excellent meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I both tried the Porterhouse experience and neither of us were impressed with the quality of the steak. It was a large cut of meat but when I think of a Porterhouse, I'm thinking a thick cut of meat too. I felt like I got a T-Bone instead. The steak was cooked to Medium Rare, the Filet side was tender but the strip side was not which I'm surprise because this is suppose to be the highest grade of meat Canada offer. It was also over seasoned with what I felt like Montreal Steak seasoning. Mac and cheese was horrible and we barely ate a 1/4 of it.  2 Stars because the servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for an early dinner. The decor was very homey, and relaxed. We were there on Canada day weekend, and it was way to hot in the restaurant. They had propped the front door open, and when we commented on how warm it was inside the waiter gave no explanation. It definitely didn't make us want to eat. The mussels appetizer was ok, the broth minimal, and not particularly flavourful.
We also ordered the corn,jalapeño fritters. They were raw in the middle, and had to be replaced. They were still mushy inside, and neither of us ate them. I will say the side sauce with them was great, and they removed the item from the bill. Both of us had the bison enchilada that was quite tasty, it had a white sauce on the bottom of the dish and chopped tomatoes on top.
It would have been nicer with a small side of salsa, as it was a bit dry.
Crime brûlée and pecan pie were dessert, both were good.
The one thing I did like was the tea was served with a China teacup, a nice touch.
The waiter was pleasant enough.
For all the rave reviews, I have to say I was underwhelmed, and probably won,t go back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in Calgary. Went here with my family and the service and food was flawless. They had a Sunday steak dinner three family members got, while my brother had tacos and a bison steak (amazing). I had apricot glazed boar and  mushroom stuffed pork belly.... literally so amazing.

Mostly everything was gluten free too, and my siblings were fine with their peanut and tree nut allergies!

I had the goat cheese cheesecake for dessert and OMG.

Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"How long did it take to get nachos? Twenty to thirty minutes.
WHY? That makes no sense. I can make nachos in one minute. Tortilla chips, cheese, other crap, BAM, NACHOS!

You'd think after taking so long for the appetizer, they would get the main course service dialed in. Wrong. It took over half an hour to get our food. The most annoying part was they kept saying that there was \"a bit\" of a wait. 10 minutes is a bit of a wait. 15 is a bit of a wait. Over forty minutes is a damn long wait.

The food was good, but honestly for how expensive it was I was expecting better. The biggest kick in the face at this place was when we asked the manager, after having waited for so long, when our food was coming out. He said: \"would you like to see it? I can show it to you.\" Not pleased with that. I should have said, \"no I don't want to see it, I want to eat it and that's the problem!\" Unfortunately I think I actually said, uhhh....yeah...I want to see it?

Pass."}
{"text":"I never would have guessed that this restaurant would be as nice as it is from the area it's in. We went on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too busy. I found out after that there is free corkage on Wednesday's so I will be back. It's warm and homey on the inside, the service was fantastic and our server knew his job. He recommended a fantastic bottle of wine and knew from out questions about certain dishes if we would like them or not. He was right, we all enjoyed our mains. Our table had the trout, duck, the beef rib steak that was the special and the elk. The meats were incredible and I'm looking forward to my next trip there to try another one of their amazing entrees. We also sampled their calamari and escargot. Both were tasty but didn't stand out as anything different for any other restaurant version. One of our party also had the flourless chocolate cake with house made dark chocolate ice cream. It was AMAZING. If you like chocolate this dessert is for you. Overall this was a great experience. The service was well timed, we had a relaxing leisurely evening and will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. The service was good, they were prompt in refilling our waters but our server didn't go over the specials with us. We ordered the porterhouse project and it was amazing with the chimichurri sauce. The bison short ribs were a bit dry and definitely needed the sauce."}
{"text":"Dinner for 4, beside the fireplace was a nice way to celebrate with family. We had the Arctic Char, the wild boar and the huge porterhouse. All were excellent. Ambiance and service were good. Only downfall was the tv in the corner??? It is distracting and the experience would have been better without it."}
{"text":"Compared to Big Fish...

We love the partner restaurant just next door called Big Fish. Exceptional beyond compare. I was excited to try Open Range and perhaps that's why I had a higher expectation of what my dining experience would be like...but it left me wishing I had gone with my old faithful. We were one of three tables so our water glasses were filled routinely and our drinks were presented beautifully from the bar. They do make lovely Mojito's. My husband had the Bison burger with potato wedges and he noted that it was quite average, and not overly memorable over all. He said he had a difficult time tasting that it was Bison. I had the Bison enchilada and I was also underwhelmed. I was expecting something different when I thought I would receive a dish with some Mexican flare, but what I received simply did not live up to the menu description. The dish was pulled bison with some background heat wrapped in two soft tortilla shells, in a dish of cream, baked in the oven with cheese and a pico de giao on top. What I ended up with was a dish that tasted like Sunday roast bison/beef, and I wished it had been topped with gravy and served with mashed potato. I thought it implied when you order an enchilada that you would have some familiar spices and flavors. It came with a side bowl of lettuce, or salad if you will, tossed with a good, but very oily Dijon mustard dressing. The calamari appetizer was not very memorable either, the sauce was too lemony, the batter lacked in flavor but the calamari itself was cooked beautifully. Never the less, I do not see myself returning to Open Range. Although the atmosphere is wonderful, and the decor is quite exceptional, the service was somewhat snooty, the food lacked thought behind the dishes, and the end result was something that was not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic 
Great food 
Love the decorations
New York steak was out of this world"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Great portions.  A bit too much meat - would have like more salad selection.  Lamb was very tender, but bison was just ok."}
{"text":"This was amazing. We began with escargot which were prepared differently than I'd ever had. We then proceeded to the Porterhouse Project for 2. Being that it was my birthday we also enjoyed a dessert. Their homemade dark chocolate and cinnamon ice creams are heavenly. When we return someday we will probably skip the appetizer. It was good but three courses was too much."}
{"text":"OK, we started with the platter local game meats....then the Alberta lamb shank with local ale gravy grits and Chorizo closed with a Vanilla Old Fashion. I may never go home, nuff said!"}
{"text":"Open Range with me, scores high points for the idea (high quality meats with unique game-type meats) and ambiance.  It is without question, a cozy space with beautiful artwork on the walls and a classy, yet rustic feel.

Believe it or not, where it lost a star for me was on the food.  When I read other reviews, I feel guilty for sharing my honest opinion.

Really what we went for was the wild meats that they served.  When the appetizer platter came out (almost $30) it was all cured meats.  I don`t know if I missed that fact on the menu, but that is not what we expected.  All of the meats looked like deli meats on a platter, and were smoky (as cured meats can be), so we didn`t actually get the experience we hoped for.  Was it tasty? Absolutely!  However, the disappointment set in that we were not able to experience the meats in a more genuine way.  Also, there was a mango-type chutney that was good, and the crackers?  Rainforest. lol.  I know rainforest crackers anywhere.   I think most people buy them as a fancy cracker.  Available in the deli at Safeway.

We also ordered Sage Grits to try.  Similarily, it was unique, but it was quite bland for my palate.

What I do need to say though, is looking around me, I hate plate envy.  There were many folks who ordered steaks, and their meals looked OUTSTANDING.  In fairness to Open Range, I need to go back for a proper meal. At that time, I can update my review.  However, for me, going in to sample the different game meats was a disappointment."}
{"text":"?Food, decor?, service, and the ambiance were all outstanding on an? early Tuesday evening at Open Range. We were lucky enough to be given a table by the fireplace by our excellent and attentive waiter Glenn. We had the shared porterhouse meal that came with the best cheesy scalloped potatoes ever and sweet seasonal asparagus?. The steak was done to perfection and we asked for our chimichurri?? sauce on the side and we also asked for some peppercorn sauce from another menu item which we were given happily. Our pinot noir was a perfect match for this special dinner. The room we were served in was rustic and quaint with a cozy log cabin feel to it. All the stars were aligned on this evening and we had a great dining experience. We recommend that you go early, we went at 5 p.m. if you would like to? have a dining experience for quiet conversation and outstanding service. Thank you to Saravanan (sp) the owner and chef who created our meal and made us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"This place came recommended to me and am sure glad I listened. Found myself a new hotspot in this city. 
Started with the calamari appetizer, followed by an order of bone marrow and finished it off with an order of their porterhouse served with scalloped potatoes and asparagus. Every bit of food consumed was outstanding!!! Flavors and portions are perfected here. 
I can't forget to mention the bread they served with the food...perfect baguette style bread. 
The whole visit was top notch, most definitely underscored by the stellar and most friendly staff here. The whole visit was a great experience that I want to share with anyone reading this review. Come here and check out this place. I can't see you leaving here disappointed."}
{"text":"Dined at open range for the first time last night...double date. Lots of great reviews so I was excited to try this place out. 

The wine list and cocktail menu was pretty amazing. So many options. Most of us had red wine but one friend had sangria. It was delish. 

We got a few appies...ribs, bean dip and calamari. All were excellent...especially the calamari! 

3 of the 4 of our group shared a 24 oz rib eye with some sides (scallop potatoes...WOW!!). I got a tenderloin and added 2 jumbo shrimp. Those 2 shrimps were good but not $12 good. 

The service was great, the food was great...I just wish the menu was a bit better. I was really wanting a sirloin Oscar or something with more seafood/ Bernaise sauce but it was more BBQ sauces. And the parking was pretty poor. Still delish and I love supporting local. Good job open range."}
{"text":"The service was great, they placed us at the back of the restaurant away from the large table that was being served at the front of the dining room. 

We had the elk rib eye and wild boar pork chop, both done very well. Even the wild rice pilaf was delicious, where often times it's easy to mess up on wild rice, this one fared well on my palate.

Price with bottle of wine, cheese plate two entree's, two desserts and tip was just under $200. 

The one miss was the \"birthday\" request, however our server did bring out a sparkler after the fact and wished a happy birthday apologizing for not bringing it out with the plate.

Go here. The service is great, the food is delicious, from my experience however I can't say that you can count on any special occasion requests although they'll certainly try!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to get to Open Range for a long time.  I was not disappointed.  First they seated us in high backed comfy chairs. Our waitress was fun and attentive. The new menu addition is a 24 oz porterhouse cut steak, which I would have ordered  but I would have needed both my kids along to help me eat it I had the artic char and it was fantastic.  I had never had purple potatoes before.  My friend had blackened steak and loved it.  The biggest surprize was the bill as it was much less that we were expecting.  We are planning on returning soon"}
{"text":"I'm quite disappointed that I have passed by this place for the past couple of years and never gave it a thought to try it out. Perhaps because it looks more like a lounge from the exterior and having young children makes us pass on these types of places. On OpenTable I was looking for a steakhouse and Open Range came up. There was an opening available and we went for dinner. We ordered the 24 oz porterhouse steak, boar chop, field greens salad, escargot, kid's Mac and cheese, goat cheese cheesecake, and a few glasses of wine. All were very good! The service was professional yet friendly. There were no kid menu foods but they were able to accommodate with a kid's mac and cheese version of their jalapeño mac and cheese. They offered a high chair for our toddler. After a bit of alcohol we had a little fun with our son who had passed out in his chair, and the staff had a hoot along with the other patrons in the restaurant. The atmosphere was very relaxed and the service was excellent. Our server saw us on the way to our vehicle and thanked us numerous times. I'm pretty sure this will become one of local frequent dining spots."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as they state they support local and organic.

The service was just okay. Not very friendly. Snooty hostess and server.

The food was mostly good but when I asked if the items with corn used non GMO corn or GMO corn the server did not know and seemed surprised and annoyed that I would ask this question.

Wouldn't a restaurant that states they use organic ingredients know the difference between GMO and non GMO?

Eating non GMO is very important to my husband and I. Supporting local growers and eating organic is also important to us.

Not in a hurry to go back to this restaurant. Dissapointed."}
{"text":"Referred by a good Calgary friend, who told us this was the best place to wine and dine.

My lovely significant other had the 6oz tenderloin while I had the bison flank.

Both were delicious.

We had the best table by the gas-powered fireplace... so romantic!

A must. Great restaurant to take your significant other for a tasty romantic dinner.

I had a great time with you my love, Caroline."}
{"text":"Booked an anniversary dinner here. It was our first time dining here We arrived at 5:30pm on Sunday and sat next to the fireplace. 

Our server was polite but not overly friendly until the end of our meal. We started with a shared game platter that was smoky meaty deliciousness served with pickles and tasty crackers. We also had a side of bread. The game platter had bacon wrapped shrimp, elk, bison, duck and ostrich from what I recall. It would be perfect for a light meal for one person. 

Hubby had a bison burger which he loved. I had a prime rib that was tender with an amazing bourbon truffle gravy, mash, roasted carrots and Brussel sprouts and a Yorkshire pudding.  Our son had a plate of scalloped potatoes as he was not in the mood for meat.  Overall, the portion sizes are generous and the flavours mingled well. We were too full to order dessert. Maybe next time...

Ambiance is dark with an old leather, western feel with pictures of horses and a wagon wheel in the corner. It was pleasant and comfortable. I can't wait to try more dishes on their menu based on this one experience."}
{"text":"My parents were in town and I wanted to take them out to celebrate their anniversary, I has been to Open Range once before and had a great experience so decided to try it again - we were not disappointed.

We started with the calamari and pork back ribs - the ribs were so good I might order a couple of servings as an entree next time! The calamari was also cooked nicely with a light batter.

My dad and I had the blackened New York, my wife had the Beef Tenderloin and my mom had the Arctic Char - all the plates were clear by the end of the meal.  I have ordered steak all around the world and this is up there for my all time favourite.  Nicely seasoned, perfect medium rare and the chimichurri sauce was awesome.  My wife and I shared the Jalapeño Mac and cheese that could be a little cheesier/creamy but had a nice spice and a little heat.

We finished off the meal by sharing the whiskey devils food cake - an interesting dessert with raspberries and whip cream - a perfect ending.

The waiter was great, knowledgeable of the menu and very attentive.

I will definitely be back, make reservations early as it is not very big and fills up quickly on the weekend."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin so let's start with the beginning, it took me an hour and a half to book a restaurant through open table for anniversary. When we went through the doors it was very warm,romantic and inviting. They have a fireplace, a TV and a quaint little bar I wish we could've sat by the fireplace but that's why you book ahead, it had people seated there the whole time! My fault..
Amanda was our server, she has a unique look which I love and is a great server! We had 3 ppl look after us which was great so our water is never low and dishes are cleared promptly! 
Eric the bartender made my hubby a whiskey cocktail which my husband loved called Silver canyon, Eric was very accommodating to my husband, and he was 1 of the 3 that looked after us!

So now the food....  They had a deal on a porterhouse steak, I believe it was 26 oz with scalloped potatoes,and asparagus, for 2 ppl it cost $72.00 which I think is great and it was fantastic fabulous!! We were on a budget because my husband lost his job, but we thought great price! Cocktails and wine tad bit pricy, but compared to anywhere else it is comparable! 
The desert was Bourbon maple pecan pie with a special coffee that had maple whiskey and frangelico it was the best coffee I've ever had! Oh desert too, not overly sweet at all!!   I highly recommend this restaurant and I think if we can afford to go back we will, oh they have a vegan restaurant and the Big fish they own too!"}
{"text":"This place was okay... nothing special. Their muscles were horrible. 

The atmosphere is cool and the service was top notch. They really knew their wine selection."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! We went here with a few friends and felt right at home. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The staff was amazing and knowledgable . I had the Elk and my wife had the Bison enchilada which she loved. We will definitely hit this up next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food was good. Lots of choices, wild game and local flavor. Good wine selection and free corkage on Wednesdays. Service could be a bit faster. Parking isn't great, call them to find the alternate parking."}
{"text":"I have eaten at so many of the best steakhouses in Calgary and this one tops the list for me. So delicious and great customer service. Can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steakhouse! I visited Open Range with my family recently and we were all extremely satisfied. The restaurant has a Western but elegant theme to it and is quite the inviting setting. We visited on a Saturday evening and it was quite busy. There was only one waitress serving about 8+ tables on our side of the restaurant but she was extremely efficient and took great care of us! 

My brother and I decided to split the 24oz Alberta Beef Porterhouse which came with scallop potatoes and asparagus. We also ordered yam fries. Everything was delicious and the portions were extremely big. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Open Range's sister restaurant Big Fish, and so had been wanting to try Open Range for a while. The space is decorated with a sort of a rustic, home-on-the-range type feel that you might expect. It's tasteful and not cheesy.

My wife and I were able to get a table on a Friday night by just calling 15 minutes ahead of time. Our server was very friendly and attentive. To start, we had a romaine and baby red oakleaf salad with chipotle dressing. It was good but not amazing.

I was tempted by the fish on the menu, but I decided I had to stick to Open Range's speciality - land-based meat! The menu had a new special for a 24-oz porterhouse steak. It explained how rare it is to find a real porterhouse because there are only 2 per cow when cut correctly (IIRC). It was meant to share, and luckily my wife and I were both in the mood for some Vitamin M (meat). We ordered that, and it came with a delicious chimichurri sauce and a couple of set side dishes. We weren't in the mood for potatoes so they happily swapped them for no charge, with some tasty asparagus with shaved manchego. We also got jalapeno jack mac & cheese which was hot, gooey and delicious. The steak was cooked nicely and extremely tender.

Overall, a solid meal in a nice setting with very good service. I will be back."}
