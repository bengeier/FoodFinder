{"text":"This is probably one of the best braised beef tenderloin noodle soup I have had. It is not spicy at all compared to the Shanghai version of the beef noodle soup.

It comes with plenty of noodles and a few side dishes. The sliced beef and tripes with chilli sauce was also delicious."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant.  
Here are the good things about this restaurant:
1)The noodle soups taste very good. 
2)The hot stone pot will keep the noodle and soup very hot till the end. 
3) Service is very friendly and understanding customers ' needs. The waitress saw we have a baby and she brought us a scissor and a small spoon
4) Interior is very spacious and comfortable atmosphere, perfect for family."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice environment. Serve food quick. Good service. However, the flavour i would say it's just so so. Me and my friend went there today to have the first try, kind of disappointed. The quantity of noodle of each bowl is less then most other noodle house in Toronto. The flavour is weird, i don't know what they put in the soup, but it's sour. And the drink we ordered is the green been drink, for no reason, it's bitter. But the dim sum cold food is ok, it's light and good taste. Also, there's bad parking problems of that plaza, esp dinner time. If you ask me whether I would go there again, ummm..,maybe not."}
{"text":"Tried last night and it's a great place, better than I though very nice customer service and decent food, highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is similar to hotpot where you have to cook all your food in a pot of boiling broth.  But that's where the similarities end.  

Price
The price is average for a bowl of noodles for ~$8.  Extra meat is additional, which is recommended or you won't have too much protein in your meal.  

Food
There's a wide variety of ingredients included (it comes with 10 small dishes).  However, the quantity of each one is on the low end (such as one quail egg, one fungus, few pieces of corn, etc.)

The soup was on the bland side but you can add more flavor with the condiments at each table.  

Service
When the food arrives, the waiters bring a boiling pot of broth in a large stone bowl.  You need to quickly add in the meat and veggies for it to cook.  They were nice to reheat one of the pots for us since we waited too long to add in the ingredients.  

This type of cuisine is called \"crossing the bridge\" and it was an interesting and unique experience.  I would have preferred having a larger quantity of a few veggies/meats, over lots of ingredients but only 1 of each."}
{"text":"My friend decided to go for something soupy cuz it was cold that day and stumbled upon here. We took at least 10 minutes trying to find this place to find out it was beside a hot pot joint that we thought was part of it. But, when we finally made it inside from the cold it was definitely bigger than anticipated. We were served with some hot tea and a menu with a pen where we can indicate the type of soup we want, as well as additional meat that we can add. 

I honestly don't know what it is with adding the toppings to a boiling hot stone bowl ourselves, but it works. 
 
We both got the original soup base with the Yunnan noodles. I've been to other noodle houses with the same concept as this one, and this wasn't as good. The soup was quite bland that my friend had to add salt, and we both had to add some chilli oil for more flavour. The noodles were well cooked however and the free toppings are a bonus. However, we were a little confused with what to do with a chicken wing that was given as part of the free toppings LOLZ. 

Overall, the upsides of coming here is definitely the fact that the service was friendly and that there is an unlimited refill of noodles. Except there's no refill on soup... lolz."}
{"text":"I crossed the street while my car was being serviced and saw the bouqets of \"congrats to the opening\" flowers and my interest was peaked. I ventured inside and the dimly lit decor reminded me of most noodle bars nowadays - would this be any different?  I ordered an original beef noodle and it came with ten \"toppings\". The toppings were tiny dishes of corn, fungus, mushrooms, ham, raw pork, etc. that you were suppose to dump into your boiling cauldron of soup. And yes, it was boiling so don't get too close and definitely not a place for young children who can't keep their hands to themselves. The noodles weren't anything special, the beef portion was small (like most noodle bars), and the customization of the broth with the toppings didn't seem extraordinary. Nothing was obviously wrong nor was anything obviously exceptional. I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here - maybe if the other restaurants were full. I would probably give it 3 out of 5 but the service was attentive and I can tell they were trying, so I'll pity-bump it up to a 4. Hopefully the restaurant picks up and adds some interesting dishes to justify the score in the future."}
{"text":"Location/Service
Outside entrance at Langham Place, restaurant is by the corner along the side of Cha Me Cha and Zen Q. Lots of parking available (either outside or underground). 

Restaurant size itself is not too big (maybe fit up to 50 people max) and most tables were setup as a group of 4 - so perfect for a family or small group.

Interior has a homey feeling, with a few drawings advertising their specialty. Service overall was okay - the staff that served us didn't seem to know much English. But there is an English menu with pretty clear instructions, so ordering was not an issue.

Food
Came here for a quick lunch - so I tried their MM Original Rice Noodle served with Lamb.
What's different about this place is they serve everything separately. You get a hot bowl of broth, with noodles, vegetables and meat on the side. Think of it as a hot pot, but just for a few ingredients. It was a very interesting experience as you can make what you want as you go. 

The broth was very hot and rich in flavor (didn't get a big MSG taste to it). Noodles were long and thin, a traditional Chinese-style. The lamb itself was good - it has a gamey flavor to it (which I personally like), so it might not be suitable for everyone. There were also different sauces you can dip for the noodles or add to the broth, and simple sides like corn and mushrooms.


Overall it's a nice place to swing by for a quick bite or warm up your stomach on a cold/windy/sick day. Price is also justifiable ($10-$15). I'll be interested to go back and try their other broths to see what kind of difference would it make."}
{"text":"Not really good to be very honest. They sell a gimmick and an idea more than anything. The taste is little to none. 

I ordered the stone hot beef noodle. Just think of it like a hot pot bowl. They give you things before which you will dunk in the hot soup. After that, that's it. It's tasteless and just hot. Nothing much to write home about."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this Yunnan noodle place in a plaza where almost every restaurant around was selling noodles!
I was in the area for a doctor's appointment and had some time to kill.
First impression was that this must be the sister company of Oriental Rice Noodles (located at warden & steeles inside the T&T plaza).
Soup base selection is very similar as well as the small dishes that accompany your order. 
I decided on the coconut curry flavoured soup base and found that it smelled and tasted much more pungent in flavour than Oriental's. Could smell the curry from the kitchen!
I'm writing this review while waiting at the doctor's and I just drank a whole bottle of water! The curry was spicy and flavorful at the time of consumption but the price to pay is \"dry mouth syndrome\".
Now to think of it, the aftertaste resembles the taste of Singaporean noodles.
I prefer Oriental."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed it. This is my first time trying a noodle house with free refills.. YAASSSSS! I think what I really liked about this place was how cozy it was and THE REFILLS lol. Honestly, I hear a lot about free refill places but never had a chance to try it until long weekend Monday. I have to say the pot of soup was great. I got the spicy pot, can't remember the name so I'll refer to it as the one with 2 peppers. It was not that spicy, but because the pot was heated to such a degree it made the soup extra hot. I burned my mouth a few times even though knowing it was hot.. But I couldn't help it LOL. The noodles came with multiple appetizers to put into the soup. Service was friendly but slow because there were a lot of people during the long weekend, which I completely understand.. But I had to ask for extra noodles 3 times before the guy came by with it.

I'll be going back soon.. Cannot pass up free noodle refills."}
{"text":"Not that this place was bad, but this rating was purely based on my personal preferences. Keep in mind I was only able to try 1 menu item, so there could be other dishes that are very good. I ordered the original flavoured broth with beef and Yunan rice noodles that came with 10 free toppings. No where on the menu did it specify what the 10 toppings were so it was an element of surprise. Each topping was plated separately surrounding the two pieces of frozen raw meat of your choice (beef) while the broth and rice noodles were served separately. The broth also came with beef already in it, so it wasn't just the two pieces of frozen beef. The server told us to throw in the meat and the mushrooms into the soup first so that they would cook thoroughly. The soup was boiling when it was brought to the table so that was nice. There were many toppings that I wasn't personally a fan of, so I think giving us choices to choose from might have been a better idea. The broth was very lightly flavoured, so there wasn't much taste to it  but the temperature was perfect for a cold winter day. Free noodle refills was a nice touch, but the first bowl was already plenty for me. I'll probably give this place another chance so I can try some of the other snacks they offer."}
{"text":"Not bad, I think they have some unique options but the taste was average. We got the yunnan noodles and the crispy rice soup noodles, and black fungus ears and saliva chicken as appetizers. The stand out was definitely the saliva chicken - they nailed the sauce and flavor and it was tender. The other things were alright, not too memorable. The decor is nice and staff is friendly though."}
{"text":"Noodle wise. Very nice texture. Not too soft like all the other ones that I have tried. In fact one of the best crossing bridge noodles. I've ordered the spicy soup based and my friend ordered the tomato soup based. I let them try my spicy, they think that the tomatoe based tasted better.

The appetizer, I've ordered the dumplings and the bean curd sheets (green onion and celery) I liked the bean curd sheet as it was a cold dish and went well with the green onions. Overall, the noodles tasted better than the appetizers. 

They accept debit card and cash for pa

The only thing is when we went it was so hot inside."}
{"text":"What a gem! Came here with a friend, and was quite impressed! We both ordered the original and the toppings were more than enough! I love the fact that you can customize your own noodle bowl! The soup came piping hot with the noodles on the side. What a cute little gem! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I like Yunnan noodles. This one wasn't amazing, but still good. I always get tomato broth, especially when I'm trying a Yunnan noodle place for the first time. This one was a tad basic for me. It lacked the complexity I find in places like Primary Taste and A Xiang. I added lamb to my pot. I can't remember how much it was, but I don't recall finding it a good value for the amount of lamb I received. My brother got the fish balls. He told me there were a good number of fish balls in his soup, and these are the tasty fish balls with filling inside. 

The highlight of my night was the bean curd sheet and green onion salad. I think it's $3.99. Good portion. One of the pieces wasn't cut properly though, so it was exceedingly large. As in an uncomfortable mouthful kinda large.

Not in my area, but if I'm around and am craving noodles, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a weeknight.   Restaurant was only 1/4 full.  We had the seafood noodle with  crispy rice patties.  The original rice noodle.  And the mala noodle.

Food came very fast.  Very good service.  Soups were boiling hot.  Free noodle refills but we found serving sizes quite adequate and no refills needed.

We also ordered the spicy chicken appetizer and found the mala sauce very addictive and tasted great with the soup noodle.

Would come back again."}
{"text":"Friends and I got to the plaza thinking about grabbing wonton noodles for lunch, but we spotted a new restaurant so we decided to check it out insteadd :D the interior is nice and I love those drawings on the poster boards 

I think that seeing all those small plates of colourful ingredients definitely hyped up our appetite and it made a simple bowl of noodles more interesting ?. The boiling hot soup comes in a stone bowl and you can just throw in all the ingredients (minus the sauces). If you ordered extra meat it will be inside the soup already when it is being served. Soup itself was quite good. I loved the taste of white pepper and liked that it wasn't too salty. I could see that it might be a bit bland for some people though (if that is the case you can add your own white pepper & salt to taste)

The portion of noodles might be small at first glance but remember it is UNLIMITED REFILLS for noodles!! In case you didn't read that on the menu 

We were already planning what to try next there before finishing our meal xD they gave us a wrong dish and immediately realized and took it away, but that cold spicy chicken appetizer looked sooo goood!!! Would love to try the other soup base as well

One star off because we ordered three soup noodles and one came a lot later than the rest. And one of us had to sit there while watching the other two eat"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this establishment from my sister who saw this on Blogto.  I have to admit, it was not what I expected.  I was actually kinda disappointed.  The soups were not as flavourful as I thought it would be.  There were 4 of us and we had the following: Hunan Brine Noodles, The Yunan Original ( which actually was the tastiest), Hunan Brisket Noodles and Hunan Fried Chicken Noodles, as well as the chicken in chili oil side dish.

The chicken I'm chilli oil was not bad but for $6.99 not worth it. As mentioned earlier the original was the tastiest but the concept of the toppings and free refill was less then adequate.

We also ordered the flavoured soda drinks which were quite tasty and refreshing,  but not worth $4 in my opinion.  

All this being said I would not recommend but if someone wanted to try it, I would not stop them. Each their own."}
{"text":"It's somewhere between a 3.5 and a 4...

Been here twice now when they still had their promo with thr use of their pockets. Inside, you can get discounts or free dishes based on the value indicated inside. 

The first time I was there, I got a free $5.99 dish but the only dish that was $5.99 was pork bone. However the second time going, they had a lot more dishes at $5.99 (I think they increased the price for many items lol).   The second time I got a free $3.99 dish and opted for the cucumber dish and it was delish. 

I would say this store is very similar to Oriental Rice Noodle (Steeles and Warden) however this restaurant has more appetizer as well I've heard the owner say they are planning to expand by incorporating BBQ and desserts in the future. 

Everything was quite yummy however some down sides to the dishes I order for example, steamed spicy chicken (had bones inside which made it difficult) and coconut curry soup base was quite bland."}
{"text":"If you like spicy noodles, this is the place to go.  Unique experience, cute condiment containers, nice decor. I really enjoyed their mango soda as well."}
{"text":"The location is very convenience for those who live in Marham. Food came very fast. Food portion was great and tasted just ok. Service was acceptable but it did take a long time to get water even there werer not many customers."}
{"text":"good try?good place?the rice noodle refill are free and unlimited. I love the tomato soup and the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"From my experience I wouldn't come back as I felt as though Instagram hyped up this place too much. The broth was much too bland. I had to add vinegar in to get some kind of flavour come out from it. I wasn't a fan of the selection on the menu either. Definitely would've enjoyed Pho ten times better."}
{"text":"Great food, quiet atmosphere. Love their spicy soup base with their potato noodles!
They also have a good selection of soup base with the super hot rock bowls which keeps the dish hot. Also the rice noodle is refillable."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my sister this evening for dinner. This plaza has a lot of different restaurants to choose from and boy do I regret coming here. 

We ordered the following: 
* Fresh Rice Noodles with braised beef tenderloin (Spicy) 
* Fresh Rice Noodles with five star general fried chicken (Spicy)

The noodles came with corn, pickled carrot (?) and peanuts. The meat was also served on the side. The fried chicken was awful, had a lot of bones and barely any meat. The beef tenderloin was unfortunately mostly fat.

The noodles came out fairly quick and honestly it did not look appealing. The taste was just not right, it had a burnt taste and lacked depth in flavour. It was spicy but that's all, it was an overall disappointment. I couldn't even stomach to finish it. Not sure why anyone would come here, it's awful. 

Service wasn't very friendly. One of the servers couldn't speak English fluently and rudely walked away. We felt unwelcome and almost walked out.

I would not bother coming here. It's just a waste of money to even try out this place. Save your stomach and go elsewhere. There are a lot of noodle joints that you will actually enjoy."}
{"text":"I brought my mother here to treat her out. The service is speedy. We both ordered the curry soup base with lamb. The soup was flavorful and a tad spicy. They both came with 12 side dishes that you add to your soup. The servers also gave us salad on the house!! I would go again!! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night and didn't have to wait (we drove by Saturday night and the restaurant was packed). I ordered the original noodles with beef. All orders of noodles come with a tray of condiments/ food items (raw pork, corn, ham, vegetable, mushrooms, chicken wing...etc). The hot soup and beef came in an iron pot and once it came, we were instructed to add the noodles and condiments into the pot. Note that there's not much meat in there. After adding everything, I still felt the soup lacked taste and had to add some chilli oil. I would recommend perhaps trying the other noodles that came with a flavoured soup. You can ask for extra noodles free of charge. I saw a family of 2 adults and a young child and they only ordered one to share and asked for extra noodles. Downside is, as I mentioned, there's not much meat/ condiments. Overall, I don't think the taste was that impressive, but if I were to go back again, I would try a flavoured soup base noodle and perhaps their hot pot."}
{"text":"Not bad, the unlimited noodles is a nice touch. 

The ten free toppings are more of a novelty than a bonus. The broth was good, although spicier than I would've expected. I felt like the spice over came the beef flavour so I didn't really get to taste the flavour. Will definitely return with -1 level spicy."}
{"text":"Saw a video ad online and was very excited to try out this place. Came here for lunch on a saturday. Luckily we came early as the place has long line up. For me, its just a hype. The soup is tasteless. You need to add the small side dishes provided. We ended up adding more salt. The meat choices for an additional $2.50 is little. Also ordered the curry coconut soup based, tasted only curry and nothing really special. Not impressed."}
{"text":"dope spot. Nice decor. Spacious and comfortable. Service was friendly and prompt. food was really good.. I ordered the coconut curry broth and it was flavor central. the ingredients were really fresh and the presentation is awesome. I would suggest ordering the side dish fried chicken. Pretty fucking bomb.."}
{"text":"Every now and then you have a horrible dining experience where the food is so terrible you leave feeling enraged with anger. This here is one of those times. We got suckered in from the blog.to promo on facebook bc it looked so good in the video, but it was extremely disappointing. We ordered 3 dishes and all 3 were bad. Not to mention they barely speak english and the menu in english is barely correct. Some of the staff dont even speak Cantonese. 

Beef noodle soup - they put in an entire chunk of beef fat. I understand beef brisket is fat for flavour, but an entire chunk that isn't edible. It was disgusting. The soup was so greasy and the noodles were so soggy. 

Tomato flavoured rice noodle soup - menu doesnt say it comes with seafood but it does. Soggy noodles, weak tomato flavour. My instant noodles at home taste better. 

Curry noodle soup - the least hateful dish of the 3. But it was still disappointing. Again with really soggy noodles. 

I wish i took pics to show you the chunks of fat. Total bill was $39. Nothing like feeling you got robbed when u just wanted a decent lunch. What pisses me off even more is that this place was surrounded by better restaurants we could have eaten at. 

I give this place 3 more months before they shut down from shitty tasting food."}
{"text":"quit authentic Chinese. It was a hot day we ordered ice water, but they gave us bubble tea for free."}
{"text":"This place was kind of hard to find. It was overshadowed by the bbq sign of next doors restaurant. Once inside it was cute. The tables for two in the middle of the room felt isolated or put out for display. If the tables were positioned horizontally, it might not feel as uncomfortable. 

Once we sat down the menus were placed in front of us. It was a bit confusing understanding the menu but we got the gist of it. We sat there for quite a while trying to figure out what we wanted. No one came over to see if we have ordered or needed help with ordering. Eventually, we Ordered the yunnan with spicy sauce and yunnan with ground pork and a rice crust hot pot. 

We got one tray with the free ten toppings. We got confused because we ordered two dishes from that category. I asked one of the staff if we only get one and she said yes. Which was weird but whatever since it's our first time. My yunnan with ground pork came and a fancy dish with a fire going came for my SO. We ate for a bit and wondered when our third dish was coming. The staff asked what third dish. We told her we ordered three things. She said no again and went to get out marked menu. And bam! Our spicy sauce was missing because they didn't see our clearly marked 'x's. She asked if we still wanted it. Of course we weren't goig to wait for it. She didn't even apologize for the mix up!    

The food was mediocre. I now understand why there is the free ten topping tray. It is to flavor your broth and make it more colorful/appetizing. Going once is enough. The noodle was itself was alright."}
{"text":"New in town, this is one of those new noodle from northern China. I got the original soup with extra lamb. The soup was very tasty and the food was very good. Nothing special so 4 star."}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok. I had the original Yunnan rice noodle with beef and also tried the rice noodle with fried chicken. I have had this kind of noodle before where the toppings and noodles come separately in a tray and you put them into the broth yourself. The noodles were fresh and chewy and the broth was hot, but the broth was a little lacking in flavour. There also wasn't a lot of beef for the price you pay. I would probably give them another chance though and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Mimi Noodle House is another one of those Yunnan Noodle place that have been opening up all around GTA the last 6 month or so.

The power of social media is making this place popular with all the photos on instagram. This is just another noodle place. Not worth the line up and the ahh and the wow...

Come if there is not line up. The staff here is super friendly and nice.

Mimi Rice Noodle with Hot Spicy Sauce ($8.99) was A OK. I do like how hot their stone pot as it kept the soup hot for a long time. 

May give their Hunan Fresh Noodle a try next time."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for lunch, I wasn't hungry so I did t try their noodle. I ordered some cold dishes, and I'm sorry to say, I can make it better at home."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Definitely enjoyed the noodles.  At first it's chewy but the more you eat it the more you in wanting to eat cus it's so good and the noodles get softer.

Also the people there are super nice.  Also enjoy the rice crisp patty which was crunchy and flavourful."}
