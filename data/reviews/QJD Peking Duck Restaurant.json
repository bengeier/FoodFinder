{"text":"The food was \"OK\"

The Hot and Sour soup was great, it has a nice fresh taste to it, however it's not comparable in richness to the great soup from Peking Man restaurant.

The  Duck which was supposed to be the highlight of the show, was all fluff, it was just average, not comparable to the great taste and flavours from Peking Man Restaurant.

The size was small, it only had one serving, did not come with the 2nd dish as it'll usually do on other places.

Not enough sauce, pickles, green onions and other stuff.

I went there for the Food, I don't care about how fancy it looks on the plate.

The Service was rude and unprofessional. Like playing with your utensils when my friend asked for a set of Fork & Knifes  to eat, they did not have bow ready for the soup, no  spoon for the soup. The comments from the staff are totally off the mark and uncalled for. The body language and facial expressions of the staff when asked about certain things or asked to bring missing items are those of \"not my fault\" \"what that's weird\" \"oh so cheap\" \"what you can't use chopsticks\" \"what you need an English menu\" ... totally unprofessional.

Only 2 good waiter staff out of more than a dozen people bussing around.

They only accept Cash or Debit Card, No CC, CC are not accepted. Like common your target are Caucasian Western Business Travellers, not accepting CC is automatically losing customers.

The price was not an issue we gladly pay what it's worth. This was supposed to be a \"High Class\" restaurant for Tourists and Travels, but we only got crappy restaurant service from a High Class wannabe.

Is it worth the price? Absolutely Not. $90 for a Duck, or $130 for the Deluxe Edition.

Was the food good? Passable, but nothing to write home about.

Was the portion sizes good? Nah, just barely enough for 2 people. I can eat the whole thing by myself, it was that small.


The Peking Man restaurant (Leslie & Sheppard) food and staff are way better and Caucasian friendly for half the price."}
{"text":"This is a new Peking duck restaurant at Woodbine and Steeles just in front of the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel.  Per the waiter we spoke with, it is part of a chain from Beijing of which the first restaurant was opened over 150 years ago.

I was fortunate enough to be able to attend for a meal during the soft opening and was pretty excited. With such a long culinary heritage and inflated prices to match, I had high expectations for the Peking duck.  I was sadly disappointed.

By course...

Deep fried tofu in batter - pretty good but it was our first course and we were hungry.  Also anything deep fried should taste good...  Coating was light and crispy and tofu smooth.

Chicken with glass noodles and mushrooms in broth - chicken was tasty and noodles pretty chewy which is how I like them.  On the downside, the course came without a serving spoon or chopsticks so everyone had to dig in with their own...  good thing I was first.  Also, a lot of pieces of chicken were just bones and little meat. 

Stir fry spicy chicken with onions - boneless cubes of chicken that were super spicy... and I can take heat!  Most people ordered water after this dish.

At this point white rice was served... one serving too late as it would have helped with the spicy chicken.

1st Peking duck
The duck carver cut off small pieces of crispy skin and served this first with some sugar - duck skin was not crispy and very oily.
The carver next cut off many small slices of duck and arranged these in the shape of a flower on a plate.  Presentation was very nice.
Remainder of duck was carved and presented on a ceramic duck serving dish.  
Flat sesame buns and thin crepes accompanied the duck along with cucumbers, onions and hoisin sauce.  Duck itself was nothing special and skin not crispy at all.  There were plenty of crepes but they were all stuck together and by the time everyone got a piece, it was all cold.

Lobster in sweet spicy sauce - lobster was quite large with lots of portions with good chunks of meat.  Sauce was excellent and I was licking it off the shell.

Beef tenderloin strips with mango and red & green peppers - beef was very tender and cooked well.

Steamed 'yau choi' with whole pieces of garlic -  was ok but then again, if a restaurant can't make this they shouldn't be in business.

Deep fried fish in sweet and sour sauce - the most visually appealing presentation wise as it was presented in the form of a rabbit.  Tasted pretty good too!

2nd Peking duck
Same procedure as first duck we had except the main presentation was in a large rectangular plate with cucumbers, onions, and sauce.  Time for redemption but no.  Again, the presentation was great but the duck was not. Skin not crispy at all and duck was nothing special. 

Duck noodle soup - cubes of what I was told was duck meat but had the texture of beef... very tough and stringy. 

Chestnut paste dessert - very smooth but the chestnut taste was lacking.

Overall, the fish and lobster dishes were the best followed by the beef and then the duck in 4th spot.  Not good if your specialty is duck.

Service was lacking as well but understandable as the place is still in the soft opening phase. 

Conclusion - there are plenty of restaurants in Toronto the serve a great roast duck at a more affordable price.
Won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst roast duck I ever try! Very dry and taste not good at all, services? Don't think about it. Price is high, I would like go to any other Chinese BBQ to have a roast duck. we are so disappointed about this restaurant, never go back!"}
{"text":"Quality food: average and tasteless; Pricing: very expensive; Servive: ok; Celaniness: stain in table clothes; Other: they like to trick u with expensive set menu without selling u in advance when u make the reservation in certain occation... the only positive: ambiant is pleasent."}
{"text":"Pros:

The duck was good.

The service was better than most Chinese restaurants.

The decor and atmosphere. 

Cons:

Every other dish we ordered.

Not enough sauce and condiments and charges extra $ for sauce and other condiments.

Expensive.

In Beijing, QJD is usually reserved for tourists. It's good to try but certainly not a place I would go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"By looking at the menu, it's pricey for Peking duck. Most ducks come Bromont Quebec, so really you are paying for the decor and the service. Why would anyone charge you for some extra green onions or sauce? That's highway robbery."}
{"text":"Very bad experience, need to pay for parking or parking is free at 4th floor, we made a reservation for 8, we end up got a small table that only fits 4. If that wasn't bad enough they're plating it's huge, it takes up half table. We end up have to set our order a side at the hall way and wait till we can finish whatever is on the table quickly so we can have our next dish. And service was really bad they didn't bother bring the hot dish back to the kitchen and let it sit their. I would not recommend this place to anyone, their are many better choice out their."}
{"text":"Very very expensive but will let you very disappointed! If I could give it minus 10 star, I will! 

If you have only two people, they would squeeze you at very bad dining location, either with one seating chair stick out at hallway, or beside the pillar. While we were eating, I heard one man who has a reservation was yelling loudly at the restaurant manager saying, you just randomly put our family into such awful dining location, but with such pricing dishes I have to pay. I totally agree, I even felt very awkward with my seating chair stick into another table. The way they arrange their customers are just like those cheap night market dining places. 


Altogether me and my wife ordered a veggie soup, a Liang Pi( a kind of cold noodle but served in a tiny bowl, kind of like salad in western meal), a whole duck and spicy boiled kidney. It costs more than $180! Even more expensive than the revolving restaurant of CN tower. Their whole duck cost us $88, and the flavour is very so so, I would say it's below the average flavour of most other Cantonese restaurants. Liang Pi served with less quantity, and so so flavour but priced almost three times than in other restaurants. Soup is super salty and spicy biked kidney has light flavour but super oily. 

If this is the only restaurant left in the world, I would still choose to cook at home!"}
{"text":"Although I have never tried QJD in China, I can confirm at least the chefs for preparing and slicing the Peking Ducks are sent over from China.  At least some authenticity there, actually it was confirmed by my friend's father in law who is the chief chef at the restaurant.


Hype? Yes because of the brand.  They charge more because they can.  A Peking Duck costs $108 versus a more regular place that charges $38.  Could I taste the difference?  Not really.  It's definitely more upscale and you come here because you're taking someone important out for dinner.  The experience is different, the chef that slices the Peking Duck comes to your table and beautifully prepares the duck for you.

To be honest, I felt the food was average, definitely does not live up to the hype it has generated.  The Peking Duck wasn't any special.  The lobster was average, I didn't even know why I even bother to order lobster at a Peking Duck place.

Lots of private rooms for those special family dinners, a typical of restaurants in China."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner and sat in a room. The ambience in the restaurant is nice and service was EXCELLENT. All the staff and waiters that served us were very friendly. They even gave the birthday boy a free rubber duck piggy bank! 

The food is indeed on the more expensive side, however we felt that all the dishes tasted great. All the food items came out really fresh and hot. We were recommended to order this fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice ($35/half) that was a chefs special for the night/week, and it was amazing! Flavour was great and skin was so crispy. We ordered the regular Peking duck dish. We enjoyed it, but it's expensive ($88), and like most reviewers said, we too can not taste that wow factor. And if you need extra sauce/condiment they charge you extra. 

Overall we enjoyed our dinner and will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I came here when it first opened, and tried to get a table for two but was disregarded. I went up to the hostess and asked for a table for two, we were asked if we had reservations, which we did not. The hostess then spoke to the manager in mandarin saying that a table will be leaving soon. A new customer rushes in and starts speaking to the hostess and manager, thus shoving us aside. We waited there for a bit, until I decided to interrupt and ask the hostess if there was a table available. The response was just a blunt no, didn't try to accommodate us in any way. Mind you this whole time they were under the impression that I didn't understand chinese, but I heard clearly the hostess telling the manager that a table will be leaving soon. I haven't tried to go back because of the terrible experience I had."}
{"text":"Too expensive, not worth to eat the roasted duck.  Da Ya Li is better than this restaurant.  Selling food presentation not quality."}
{"text":"Great, authentic peking food; great service, feels like real old Peking--everyone is warm and welcoming; when they serve you the duck, a gong is ringed accompanied by auspicious sayings, which is so traditional old Peking custom! First high end restaurant of Northern Chinese cuisine, at a convenient location. The floor layout is a bit crowded, but the experience is bsolutely worth the price."}
{"text":"Came with a large group for a special occasion.  We decided to see what's the hype in this prestigious duck.  Throughout the dinner, we experienced up-selling of the duck, why this duck is worth the price. Each employee had said different things - so here is a consolidation of the differences between $88 and $118 according to the restaurant:

The $88 duck is a 4 lb duck, vs $118 is an 8 lb duck.  Only the bigger duck have enough surface area to carve out the peony flower.  This flower presentation is also copyrighted in China as of 2014 - therefore you can only experience the unique presentation at their restaurants.

The duck is LOCAL. Regardless what they say, these ducks are not flown in from Beijing.  A waiter did tell us only the $118 is from a specialty farm, vs $88 is not (we asked the Manager to get the right story)

The pastry/pancake is from Beijing - to maintain its \"quality\". 

The finely green spring onions are specially ordered from a vendor - as it is unique in its \"fine chopping skill\"

When you receive the duck at your table for the presentation of the carving, you will be given a show, including a \"gong\" to start the show, and to see how the peony is created.  

Was this duck good? It was tasty. However as the skin was so finely carved out, I found it was difficult to appreciate the crispiness of the skin. 

3 stars for the service - we did get a lot staff which came to explain to us on the restaurant history, the food detail, and explanation of the menu. We had a staff specially stayed around to serve us (why? I don't know why, he just floated next to us). HOWEVER, everyone was very courteous, and we appreciate their consistently walkthrough of each dishes and story-telling.

Were the other food good? They were all very flavourful - however generally more greasy, with higher price then typical Chinese restaurant.  We anticipated to have the Squirrel Fish, which unfortunately the waiter forgot to put into our order (our table did not make a big deal, as he was very courteous. It did look good in the other table).  Would we go back? For the price, we may consider going elsewhere.

Limited parking in the front compliment to customers. If not available, hotel parking is available at the back at $0.50/ half hour."}
{"text":"QJD Peking duck is a renowned establishment in China but unfortunately other than presentation I found the dishes very average. The Peking duck didn't taste any different from other low budget restaurants. The packaged course ended up costing $150 per person for a total of 12 people. It was enough food to fill us up but not sure of it was worth my hard earned money."}
{"text":"As someone who has been having Chinese food growing up, I would say QJD is without doubt one of the best Chinese restaurants in Toronto. They've got authentic, toothsome, delicate and high-quality Peking duck, which tastes exactly the same as the ones I had in Beijing. Besides, they also have various types of dishes originated from different parts of China and they are all authentic and delicious. Ive been there for about 5 times and the menu surprises me every time. QJD is the best recommendation I can offer if you want to try some real Chinese."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Asked to book and make order 1 week ahead. Still told to change order when we are arrive, cause the dishes are \"not prepared today\".

The dishes were served after 1 hour we got seated.
Overpriced as well.
There are so many similar and much better places to go for the duck."}
{"text":"If you want authentic then this is no where near authentic. Especially with a restaurant called \"Peking duck\" you would think so. Your money is going towards the big fancy place, fancy plates, platters but not the food. They tweaked the taste to make it memorable as their own signature that I would never forget & never going back. They also have \"sugar\" to dip the duck in; how fancy, we all love sugar & never trying to avoid it. Oh & sauce is very important and this sauce had this taste which was just so off. We had to go eat Peking duck again the next day to make up the satisfaction. I feel bad for the people trying Peking duck for the first time. The price we paid could have went towards a 3 course of authentic & still fancy Peking duck as oppose to this 1 course. Luckily I tried to reserve this restaurant for my birthday but it was fully booked. I would have been devastated. But you know, try it & see what I mean! P.s the onions cucumber were such little portions, if you ask for more they are an extra charge !"}
{"text":"This place serves Peking duck that's not nearly as good as Dayali or Dragon Boat Fusion for more than DOUBLE their price. $88 for ONE duck.... We almost could not justify it but we gave them the benefit of the doubt that it might be epic. Nope, we were wrong. It honestly tasted very average, the sauce for the duck tasted weird too, almost like those yucky Chinese medicine taste. They gave us so little and when we asked for more, they said it was $2 extra... 
We also ordered their ???, it was so tough and dry... Very disappointing. Don't get fooled by those cool looking photos online, unless you're just there to get that photo.. Never coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Never come back again. Food did not match the price. Didn't taste that good.  And they cannot make roast duck bone soup."}
{"text":"Far be it for me to argue over the quality and price that seems to be the major issues for other yelpers when they visit QJD Peking Duck. BUT I think part of the reason why the reviews have been low is not because quality is low and prices are too high, it's because they're DIFFERENT than what people have come to expect from the locations in China.

Think about it, labour costs, rent, food costs are WAY higher in Canada (especially with minimum wage going up to $14), do you think they have these issues in China? Probably not, and those costs have to go somewhere - that's right the consumer. In China while a Peking Duck feast is prestigious, it is also more culturally the norm, and therefore the raw ingredients are more plentiful locally without having any import costs. And items like Duck are mass produced more so than other farm animals due to popularity and prestige.

Lets address the other concern, the quality isn't the same as in China. let me ask you a question if you feel this way: Have you ever had the french fries at McDonalds here in Canada and then gone to the states and had the French Fries down there. They're really super close, but it is different, and coming from Canada we prefer our more salty Canadian versions because it is what we know. But coming the other way Americans complain that our fries are more salty.

The main ingredient at QJD is Duck. Is it the same Duck as is served in China, no but they've painstakingly vetted every breed and supplier in the area to find a version that is close to what you can expect in China - it's never going to be bang on but it's going to be pretty close. I learned that because Ontario has anti-force-feeding laws now in place (the same methods that are used in Quebec to create fatty duck liver/Goose Liver for Fois Gras - which is how the ducks are fed in China), we produce a local Duck that is much less fatty than can be expected at the original QJD's in China. Alternatively I learned that while less fatty the ducks here are for more moist and succulent without fat and the meat is more tender than can be expected in original locations.

Having learned all this I was able to dine at QJD's first Markham location  a couple of weeks ago and have a Peking Duck Feast for the very first time. Result? Insanely, Amazing. The pageantry, the show, the attention to detail - all reminded me of what one could expect when dining at a traditional western steak house where table side service for things like Chateaubriand steak or table side Caesar salads.

We began with the 4 seasons/4 colours salad which they mixed and added dressing to at the table, I really loved the colours the freshness AND the crunch from the crispy fried taro crisps. To follow we went right into the duck. The fatty breast which table sugar is poured over is sheer decadence, fat + sugar + crispy skin = coronary heaven. Followed by one of China's national dishes the QJD duck slices arranged on painted china plates in the shape of a flower. Moving on we went to the more traditional serving style with the high quality pancake, radish, onion and yes more duck meat with a little sauce to pull it all together.

Other noteworthy dishes were the deep fried sweet and sour inspired tiger shrimp, the special pork hock stewed soup and an endless steam of new foods to my palate. Each delicious and expertly prepared in their own right, each a delight for my mouth.

Sometimes, ignorance can be bliss, and in this instance, yes maybe there is a difference between what guests of QJD Markham experience and pay for vs. what you have come to expect from China, BUT do factor in prices, costs and the fact that we have different methods and standards for the treatment and raising of livestock in this country over others so while they've created an amazing experience, visit knowing that if you've had QJD in China it WILL be more expensive, it IS a special meal out and it will taste close but not exactly as you may have remembered or how you think you remember.

I enjoyed it immensely for what it is, and would gladly return for a half duck all on my own!

Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"Excellent high-class Chinese dining experience. Lots of attention paid to presentation and quality. Peking duck is carved table-side with some of it arranged in a flower as a royal arrangement. Food is not overly salty or flavoured and tastefully prepared. Ambiance is classy despite the hotel it accompanies. Easy parking access in the garage behind the hotel. A must-try if you love Peking duck."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and great service.. will come  back for sure .. I was in Toronto for business trip and I went to this restaurant only because It's in the hotel where I'm staying not because of the reviews.. and  I'm surprised that it has only 3 stars and half this place deserves 5 stars!!! We ordered beef, chicken, pork and fried rice and everything was just great!!"}
{"text":"Wow
such a big restaurant only accept cash/debit? 
cant afford a credit card machine?
or u just want avoid tax?
wdf is the owner thinking?

dude u must be kidding me
$120 for a duck and no credit card
splendid"}
{"text":"When I heard that a QJD Peking Duck was opening here in Markham, I was very excited!! I've been to QJD and Da Dong locations in Beijing and had the pleasure of the proper experience. So when moms birthday came around, we all wanted to try this almost mythical duck here in out own backyard... Unfortunately, disappointed would be an understatement. What they are serving here in no way justifiably represents the majesty of this world famous dish. The colour of the duck served to us was brown and virtually tasteless. In Beijing the colour is more orangey, the skin is separated from the meat, allowing it to be crispy without being oily. On an up note, the service was surprisingly nice, servers were pleasant and answered my moms questions fully..."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth meal here in six weeks.  The pancakes for the Beijing duck were the most authentic I've had in North America -- very like they do it in Beijing.  The kungpao chicken was excellent.  The spicy diced lamb tasted good though the meat could have been more tender.  The Sichuan steamed fish with chili sauce was also good.  The Beijing scallion pancakes were crispy and reminded me of similar snacks I used to have in Beijing's Ritan Park 30 years ago.  The fried rice with duck and bean paste was moist and tasty.  The sautéed Choy sum and pea shoots and mushrooms were very fresh.  A complimentary bowl of walnut and date dessert soup rounded off one of the best Chinese meals I have had.  Price for all these dishes with tax was $192, which is a little pricier than many Chinese restaurants but worth it for the food quality and friendly service."}
{"text":"There was not an English menu and the hostess offered zero assistance. Not quite sure if it's that we're American, or white, but not impressed at all with the obvious."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night with a party of six.  The parking lot is tiny!!!! There's only about 8-10 spots reserved for this restaurant, everything else is for the hotel and the bank in the area.  The outside of the restaurant looks beautiful but the inside was very average.

Food is expensive!!!! A peking duck is $118, included 24 wraps, 6 mini sesame buns, individual dipping sauce and scallion, and a plate of cucumbers.  Duck was average at best.  The rest of the food is also very expensive. Between the six of us, or bill was almost $300 after tax and the food wasn't very good. 

Service was fast and efficient as they had tons of servers, food runners and managers.  They spoke English, Cantonese and Mandarin.

The two stars I gave was for service and the exterior of the restaurant.

To end, below average food, extremely overpriced, good service."}
{"text":"Pretty good duck, a little bit pricy but it was very filling. We ordered the heavier 8 lb duck for 5 people and few more dishes."}
{"text":"My parents brought me here for my birthday dinner. My dad made the reservation almost a month in advance, so he got to pretty much pick whatever time he wanted.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated, spacious and clean.  Definitely feels a lot more upscale than the average Chinese restaurant. There were a lot of waiters around, and they were much more attentive, so I thought service was definitely better. 

We order the deluxe duck, which the chef cuts and plates into a pretty flower in front of your table. The duck was very yummy, we each got our individual sauce and green onions (usually it's just a shared plate), and apparently the cucumbers were organic. However, was the taste worth 3x the price of other peking duck places? I don't think so... So my conclusion is that you are really just paying that price for the brand of this restaurant and the \"experience\" of seeing it plated nicely into a flower. When the waiter served our duck, he didn't say much. However, there was a big table nearby who seemed to know the manager, and they specifically asked the manager to give a speech when they got heir duck. The manager gave a very nice history of the restaurant, a lot more details about the duck, how they cook and cut it and how they plate it. That was actually very interesting. I wish this was offered to every customer who ordered the duck.

We order a few other items. I thought the other dishes were actually quite good, and noticeably better than other restaurants. The price were still slightly higher than average, but I thought the other dishes were more reasonable given the better quality.

Overall, if I had $$ laying around, I would probably come here over other peking duck restaurants.  However, I don't, so if I really wanted peking duck, I would probably choose another restaurant that has much better value."}
{"text":"Being fully aware that the 2 star rating for this place already serves as a huge red flag warning, I found myself here anyway to \"experience\" the peking duck luxury. My small party of 4 had reservations but we were still seated an hour late. As an apology, the manager served us \"desserts\" as soon as we sat down. Um excuse me? How is that even appropriate in terms of order of dishes? Also, the desserts were absolutely disgusting. Not only did we not finish it, we had to spit it out after the first bite because it would've been a waste of calories to swallow it. While the presentation was certainly nice, the dessert was like a gritty cold paste.. with no flavour. 

As for the star of the show, the peking duck was only just standard. Definitely nothing more special than a regular peking duck you could get at any Chinese restaurant.. but it sure did cost 3x more! The stir fried mango and beef dish was also iffy - the beef cubes themselves were tender and tasty but the mango was sour and stiff. 

All in all, this place is just about the fancy appearances, it's completely superficial and definitely NOT worth your money."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Called to make a reservation for a wednesday night at 8pm for 4. When we arrived it was a full house & the hostess said it would be a little bit of a wait. Got seated around 825-830...food is good , decor is modern and everything was clean. Must note some of the items you see on the menu does not come out as they look (ie. The sugar coated taro in the photo had a beautiful presentation of the sugar web on top but when presented...its nothing like that). Would come here for a special occasion as you are paying a premium for presentation & overall more \"upscale\" atmosphere. Worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner on Sunday and as a Peking Roast Duck fan, I was not disappointed. We ordered ?QJD PREMIUM 'PEONY DUCK' ? and the ?Cabbage Soup?, ?Signature Crispy Pigeon Fish?, vegetables, and ?Sweet and Sour Pork?. The Roast duck is very authentic - The service was very attentive and I believe the manager comes and talks to every table. He is very persuasive and could probably sell you anything! They also changed our plates very often and came and checked in on us to ensure that we had everything that we needed. The desserts that came after our meal was also a lovely gesture, there was little duckling shaped crispy puff stuffed with datesPaste?Walnut Crisp. The restaurant has Chinese and English menu, Parking is also very convenient. It's a good place for a party?"}
{"text":"Nothing but a rip-off. Food and service combined for what it's worth they pretty much overcharged the whole thing by a hundred percent. For $150 per person (their holiday menu) without alcohol you will get your money go for a lot further at many other fine dining restaurants in the GTA; for Peking duck, you can get the same quality (if not even better) in the city for half the price they charge. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This place is not even deserving of 1 star. If I can choose a no star on Yelp, that is I would have chosen.  I think this is the worse meal I've had in a month.

I've made reservations weeks ago for 8:00pm, I was there 7:45pm, so they wanted us to wait until 8:00pm no problem. We were placed at a table where people kept trying to get out. Basically, not even an alley for the back row to get out. Then we moved to another table, which is broken! Had to move again, no cups, no service, nothing.

The pea-shoot with oyster mushroom, I honestly think I can cook better ones at home. Not enough oil used and no taste. Old...

The egg-white with broccoli, they can't even get the broccoli right. The egg white base was thick, lack the consistency. I can get the same dish at other Chinese restaurants for half the price.

The pepper beef with broccoli was way overpriced for $27.99 and beef marinade was a bit sweet. 

Sweet and sour pork was way too sour and the tofu battered was not done right. Usually that's the same batter they use to fry milk dessert.

Also, I have never been to a restaurant where I have to order wine by the bottle. I try to ask for a glass of house red, no 6oz, no 9oz, you can only order by the bottle!!!! The waitress was able to enter into the computer by cup, but yet another waiter came back and told me I have to order by the bottle. 

Drumroll, we finished the whole meal and the signature duck is still not out. Bad bad bad service and management even worse!!!!! If you have a good reputation and branding in Beijing, don't ruin this as the goodwill of a business is extremely important regardless where in the world a restaurant is opening. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Over priced for many items. Selective items are very good, some are average, and some are on the poor side, but the presentation all around is beautiful. One would have to go a couple of times to figure out what suits their palate. As this was our first visit, we took guidance from George, our very helpful server. His recommendations appear to be same for all tables he served (looked like everyone around us ordered the same combo package, but the dishes were independently ordered and most likely suggested by George). 

Next visit, the salted egg oysters are a must. The beef stir fry and baby snow pea leaf dishes are going to make a reappearance. Definitely skipping the deep fried sweet and sour fish (too much batter and very difficult to find the fish), and the sweet and sour pork is a pass because the pork is way too lean and the deep fried batter was soggy along with no \"bounce\" to the pork. 

Opted out of the soup as it didn't seem reasonable to charge in excess of $30 per person per bowl. 

Given that we ordered a total of 9 dishes, only the Peking Duck, oyster and veggies stood out; as I cannot totally recall the other dishes is a definite cause for concern. I believe I am extremely generous with the 4/5 stars. Should my next visit find just average dishes, I would have to give this place a solid 3/5. However, if you're here to impress with an expense account at a clean Chinese restaurant with staff who speaks English, I think those in this category would give this place a 5/5. However, I'm a sucker for food, and less of a sucker for a set of puckered lips ."}
{"text":"The food was great, and staff were excellent! The food was delicious! They do need bigger tables, or smaller plates, though. If you order a lot, you have no space to put your food on.

It is right next to a hotel, so if you want to use the washroom, it's in the hotel.

Being seated was fine. There was no wait (obviously)."}
{"text":"Feeling very rip-offed!! Avoid!!!

tl;dl:
- Spent $350 for 3 people. They upsell you to order expensive pre-set combos by giving you ONLY their special menu.
- The desserts in the combo would come very late, because they are \"very busy\" during holidays.
- Their credit card machine would be \"broken\", and you can only pay with cash or debit.

Visited today. They gave us only the pre-set combo menu that would cost each person $110+. Asked if they had a regular menu, they said no not during holiday seasons. After the meal we saw people in the other table reading regular menus. The waiter told us because they spoke only English, it's easier, and there's pressure from management to get people to order combos. Well, at least they were being honest.

The food and the duck was actually not bad, but not much fancier compared to a good Chinatown restaurant. Desserts came super late after we finished our food (~25 min). Apparently many people complained to them already as per the waiters. The most ridiculous thing was that their credit card machine happened to be \"broken\" when we were paying. I should have checked other people's comments on Yelp before I visited, since people already mentioned this. Alas!

Overall this was a super disappointing experience. Their quality of food and service certainly do not match their price. It was supposed to be a great celebration and a happy evening for us. Thanks to them it's kind of ruined and we will never visit again."}
{"text":"Peking duck was really really good, but everything at this restaurant is too price. You can have Peking duck at so many restaurants for half the price. Of course the experience of having the chef cut and plate the dish right at your table is a cool experience but I wouldn't say anything actually stood out from my experience. Ever dish we ordered was mediocre and nothing wow us."}
{"text":"This place was god awful. Most items we ordered we're really bland.  These are the following items we ordered 

Peaking duck - the only thing they got right 

Mango beef. Very bland no seasoning

The Kung Pao chicken wasnt good and left a funny feeling on everyone's tongue. 

The only good thing about this place was the presentations on the items. 

During the cutting of the duck they did a gong ring for us. Which was very tacky. 

At the end when we paid the bill which felt very over priced the manager had to count the money as if we were going to short change them 

All in all awful. I would take that $250 and spend it else where. I do not recommend it"}
{"text":"Too over price and service is so bad. We wait for the Peking duck for 1hr and even ask for the water we need to wait for 15 min!

One time only,not coming back!"}
{"text":"Food are tasty and delicious with good preparations. Presentations are uniquely done in traditional Chinese ways which the cook cliched the duck in front of you. Different from other local Chinese restaurants, server is very polite & friendly to explained each dish ingredients. They tried hard to meet our requests. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Came to QJD for dinner, located inside the Courtyard Marriott hotel. Parking outside is usually full, so best to park in the covered lot accessible from the back. No need to pay, just go in through the hotel and give your license plate number to one of the staff inside the restaurant.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the ambiance is that of a high-end Chinese restaurant. The staff is friendly and generally attentive. The food is pretty decent, however, at this price point, I was expecting better.

We ordered the QJD premium roast duck set ($88), the signature crispy pigeon fish with sweet and sour sauce ($49), Chinese broccoli with ginger sauce ($16), and for dessert the duckling-shaped crispy puff stuffed with date paste ($22 for 6 pcs).

The roast duck is quite good, with the meat being very tender and not overly fatty. However, I prefer my roast duck skin to be more crispy. The pancakes were made extremely thin, allowing the taste of the duck meat to shine through without being masked by the wrap. But the duck here is so much more expensive than other places serving similar Peking-style duck, and it's not much better. 

The crispy fish was very tender and delicious. They even made it look like a squirrel, which was very cute. However, at almost $50 for this super tiny fish, it really wasn't worth it. And being deep fried and smothered in s&s sauce, a cheap tilapia would have tasted just as good as this special pigeon fish.

The duck-shaped puff with date paste was again cute, but a little dry. At this price, I can buy out the entire tray of date pastries at the local Chinese bakery store and still have enough money left for half a dozen egg tarts!

The food here is decent but far too overpriced for what you get. What really irritated me is seeing that they charge for extra sauce, scallions, and cucumber strips ($1.39 each). After charging $88 for the duck, is it really necessary to nickel and dime customers over a little extra sauce? What's worse is, the scallions were all dried out and not even fresh. I wouldn't request more even if it were free, like at every other restaurant!

This place was good to try once, but at this price point, there are so many better restaurants. Unlikely I'll return again."}
{"text":"Way over-priced meh Peking duck. However, they are over-priced in Beijing too so not surprising.
Duck was a bit cold when served. The duck-shaped pastries and mustard boneless duck feet are good but again too pricey. A place for business meeting rather than a place for the actual food...."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal, shared with a fantastic friend. As a born-and-raised Canadian, I must admit... I was a bit intimidated when I first walked in the door. My host and the restaurant staff took the time to explain customs and food choices. Not only was the dinner fantastic, I was able to learn a fantastic amount through this experience. The food was spectacular, and the table-carved Peking Duck was a nice touch. Would certainly return, and encourage anyone who is \"on the fence\" to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very Mediocre and overpriced food.
It's riding on the famous name but I can't imagine it tasting the same.
Hostess took me to the wrong reserved table. There were too many service staff. One of them was just standing around fixing his hair and picking his nose. (No joke)
One of them took our tea pot for a refill and forgot to bring it back. He stood there watching a chef cut up a duck instead.

I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????2???????1-2??????"}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Peking duck? This restaurant provides the taste and proper dining experience but without being pretentious. Lots of tasty interesting dishes (try the sauteed duck hearts marinated in Chinese alcohol!) You won't find chicken balls and chow main on this menu, but EVERYTHING I tried was delicious. Price was the only reason not to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Finally the authentic Peking Duck arrived in Canada. I come from Beijing, the Duck is almost the same taste as I had in Beijing. Service is excellent, they explain how they make the Duck, and chef slice the Duck just in front of you. Price is high, but definitely worth it, will go back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but just waaay too over priced!. $115 for Peking duck that's insanity!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Disclaimer: I read Yelp before coming to this restaurant and was prepared for the price of the dishes being expensive so my rating isn't based on the price. 

Parking is confusing but basically if you can't find a parking space at the front, you can park at the hotel parking for free because you are going to the restaurant.

Reservations is recommended. This place was packed! There are many private rooms if you want to book for a group.

The restaurant was bright and designed with a Chinese modern feel. Washrooms were surprisingly clean. There are two washroom locations, one inside the restaurant, individual rooms, and one at the hotel (you walk outside of the restaurant to get to the). I recommend the one in the restaurant because it is closer. Could be confusing! My bro went to the one outside and took a detour.

We ordered: 

1. Shredded lamb - moist and flavourful.
2. Ma po tofu - very spicy for me, but my family liked it. 
3. White eel with black bean paste - too much black bean paste, but eel wasn't bad. 
4. Inside out fish - crispy and no bones. Pretty good.
5. Duck $88 - we got a small plate with neck skin and sugar first. The skin was super crispy and nicely seasoned. We got two places of duck. One white meat and the other dark meat. The duck was juicy and tender. Pretty good. The server was cute because he hit a gong and said words of well wishes before serving the duck. We had 24 pieces of wraps that were super thin. The hoisin sauce tasted like black bean sauce, which was interesting. I wished they gave more condiments because there just wasn't enough for 24 wraps. I spoke with a server that said the duck comes from a free range Ontario farm hence there is hardly any fat on the duck. The duck is cooked with the same technique as the one in Beijing. I have to say, it was good. There was a good amount of meat and I was pretty full after. 

Tip: ask for the duck Carcass to take home. There was a lot of meat on it and you can make soup. They do not use the left over meat and put it in Fry rice. 

Dishes and quickly. Duck was served last. 

The servers were efficient and answered all my questions. A lot of people complained about the service on Yelp. Honestly, it's on par with most Chinese restaurant service so I was totally ok with it. They aren't proactive but did respond to our request to switch plates and get ice water. 

Overall my tips: 

1. Ask for the duck carcass.
2. Get the $88 duck, not the $118. Not worth it.
3. They accept credit cards.
4. Park in the back for free.
5. Washrooms are better in the restaurant.
6. Reserve in advance.

The prices are more expensive than other places but they do give big portions. I say have the mindset that it will be pricey and treat yourself. It was a good experience for me. $55 per person for 6 people. I would save this place for a special occasion though."}
{"text":"I would be the happiest to report that the venue, food, and the hype on blogto was worth it. That the built-up anticipation was ALL THAT AND MORE.

But can I say it unequivocally and without hesitation? That is a definite NO.

I want to point out the neat things because when you boil it all down, it was one of those 'neat-to-try-once' experiences.  

It's great that they wear face masks while they tenderly slice the duck. It's great that they plate said-tender-sliced-duck and turn it into a beautiful lotus flower that you can then oooh and aahhh at. Other 'neat' touches were sesame bao's (that other restaurants don't generally offer) and paper-thin duck wraps that come warm over a nice candle-lit steamer.

But it doesn't change the fact that it's a very dry (though tenderly-sliced-and-I'm-sure-at-one-point-loved) duck.  Did it redeem itself of the high price tag? Ultimately no. You left feeling like the overall experience fell short, like a series ending that doesn't leave you quite satisifed."}
{"text":"Great service and some dishes tasted delicious.   

Off course we order the Peking duck and it tasted decent.    We enjoyed their sweet and sour pork, crispy squirrel fish, braised tofu and sautéed diced beef filet .   
It's definitely worth going for celebrations."}
{"text":"The duck was not even as good as the ones in China and they charge for very high price. 
Servers are not familiar with their job. Our waitress recommended the fried milk with beef something, and we didn't like the fried milk since it's too oily. When she comes back to our table she says that she doesn't like that either!!! Then why would you even recommend it?????? 
I don't like it at all and won't recommend anyone here to try."}
{"text":"I visited during soft opening time.  The Peking duck was best I've ever had so far in Toronto.  Service was terrible and disorganized, hope it gets better once it's officially open."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  Going in with low expectation already as I have been to many roasted duck restaurants in Peking m, Hong Kong and Toronto. QJD even in Peking wasn't my favourite. It was mediocre at best, including this Toronto location. I think the major problem doesn't lie in the food itself actually-we ordered the duck obviously and about 6-7 other dishes.  The duck was not served on its own, it was served when there were a bunch of dishes on our table. They used these huge plates (for the look) and ended up transferring all of them to small plates (making not so hot, just warm dishes even colder now at this point).  We haven't really start eating yet, the dishes just arrived like maybe 5-10 mins ago.  Let me just talk about the duck first, it was almost cold by the time they serve it to us, since the chef already took it out for awhile and cutting took some time too, and of cos the plating plus the server transferring our existing plates.  Taste was not bad, mediocre like I said, the duck tasted fresh.  Condiments were in small portions, for sure it's not enough for more than 2 people and there were 7 of us, extra charges when u want more.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is why I didn't give one star rating because it is a very nice place and I could see they are trying to tune into the fine dining experience as the manager came and socialize with us, trying to make a good impression. But the service and food both are below average.  As the server wants to put our left over roasted duck on the floor. You are really just coming for the decor if you are into that. The other dishes are hit and miss.  They gave us a rubber duck money bank as we were there for a birthday celebration as well, which we thought it was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I had heard from a number of friends and colleagues of an authentic Peking duck experience at this restaurant in a Markham hotel. 

There was one parking spot available when we arrived for dinner at 5pm. However inside the restaurant there was ample seating available.

We had a few dishes. Sticky rice with pork filling was good. The duck specially prepared unlike the more common style at Cantonese restaurants with a bit of smoky flavor. Duck was served with a gong greeting which was funny and a bit different.

The price point was very inflated for the quality of food. From a rating perspective about 2 and half stars. Given this we are not likely to return again."}
{"text":"Great menu with wide variety of unique dishes. Especially love the appetizer noodles and salads (and I'm typically not a salad person). The duck which is their specialty is different from the Peking duck style at other Chinese restaurants in Toronto area. Extra thick & crispy skin and drier meat. I personally prefer the juicier style duck served at other places which also serve you the entire duck and additional dishes with the remainder duck meat for half the price. But the Beijing style duck at QJD is good too and worth trying."}
{"text":"The good: opened since 1864 from Beijing! One of the top/if not the top Peking duck place in China. So a bit of credit for opening here in Toronto. In terms of the food, the Peking duck was good, definitely different from the ones in Toronto but...

The bad: ... it's still not at the golden standard that you would get from 'Beijing'. The waiter notified us that while this was still good, due to Canadian standards this is definitely not the same duck you would be having in Beijing, there is more 'fat' in the ones you find in Beijing (Which is unfortunately not approved in Canadian standards). Nonetheless, you are still getting a premium duck, possibly the best in Toronto, however....

The ugly: the price is something you will have to pony up for. I highly recommend 1) come with a group ($118 for a duck...), 2) while the rest of the menu is good (e.g. The duck heart is amazing), it is fairly expensive - don't come to eat a buffet or else you will be having quite the bill!, 3) get someone who has eaten at this restaurant before or knows Beijing type of food (this will at least give you Beijing's specialty food).

Other thoughts: decor is nice, even though it's still soft opening there is a huge wait (tons of people even on a weekday past dinner time hour), free parking on hotel lot level 5!!! (There is limited space in front of the restaurant), expect wait times so better to reserve.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. At first my families were really impressed with their sweet & sour pork. Unfortunately, we have to  wait for one whole hour for the Peking Duck and the duck is room temperature and I am basically biting on a piece of cold duck fat. So disappointed with this place, will not recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"If you're having your first Peking duck experience, please try somewhere else first along hwy 7 (e.g Dayali or Dragon Legend for Ayce Peking Duck wraps). You'll have a happier time and won't feel like you wasted so much money. I thought R&D with their Peking duck was expensive at $75 but they do it way way better than here. 

Ordered the $110 Peking duck with the rose plating. Don't fall for it. Just look for pictures lol. A few side dishes were also ordered but it was nothing special. The saddest was the \"hand-crafted\" duck pastries. They were some of the driest pastries on earth. I've said it to my friends. A moist chocolate cake or even McCain delights would've been more satisfying. They're pretty but that's it. 

FYI my bill was $300 for $110 duck, 3 dishes, 2 fruit shakes, duck pastries.  Might be missing something but it will not be cheap here."}
{"text":"The renovation of the restaurant is very nice. It does worth ONE STAR, the presentation of all the dishes were very nice especially their duck, so duck is a must try and it was very nice to have ONE STAR.

However... 
1.Since the first moment we walked in, we made a reservation n we show up on time, the host made us wait for at least ten minutes while we found out after that some of our party already in n waiting for us at the table, huh? What's going on?
2.It's a newly open restaurant, with no air-con, it was so really hot in there.you spent so much on the renovation, why don't you install an air-con?
3. Such a nice renovation, why don't make its own washroom? Customer needs to walked out to the restaurant n using the hotel washroom.
4.lack of parking, you need to park at the back if the hotel n pay for the parking. Or park across the street n park at the bank.
5.the duck was nice n the wrapping skin was cooked perfectly, however, I am paying $88 for a duck, you still charging me extra for a little plate of dipping \"hoisin sauce\"?
6.We have guess who native of Beijing, other than the duck, mostly of the dishes not authentic, and alot of representative dishes was not on the menu.
7.the portion was very small, if you go with a big group, please order the food double in order to get one piece per person to try.
8.they don't take major card, but they do accept \"alipay\", and there was not English at all on the menu, seem like they only prefer native chinese customer.
9.the food wasn't even hot, if it's right off the wok and serve, it shouldnt be just warm, they may precook alot.
10. Very slow service, the food took forever to serve, and the food was only warm? and we finished all the food and keep waiting n waiting, if we didn't ask the server, they wouldn't even bother to tell us the dishes we order was sold out, they don't even have rice to make fired rice, seriously?
11.it costed us $60/person without ordering any alcohol nor seafood, with this price you can walk in any chinese restaurant n have a very nice huge lobster or king crab.

So if you still really want to try, good luck."}
{"text":"Just dropped in on a whim after checking in late to the hotel next door. Fast service and the food was delicious. Upscale authentic Chinese food - no fillers just good food. The wait staff and manger made us feel very welcome. Kung Pao chicken , Mango Beef and Chinese Broccoli were perfect. Way too much food for 2 people so great leftovers. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am super stuffed! Generous portions of delicious food; thank you to QJD Peking Duck for this lovely feast. In an intimate sit-down setting, I easily made new friends with the Yelpers around me. Being their specialty, the Peking Duck is a must, of course. Surprisingly, I also really liked the Tornado Salad. It's crunchy, juicy and a little bit vinegary, so it really got my appetite going. The biggest wow-er was definitely the fish - it looked like a blooming onion with a fish head! While I can't say I'm a huge fan, the dessert is a cultural delicacy that is true to its roots, so I was still really excited to try it. After listening to a bit of history behind the food, the founding of the restaurant, and knowing that they had brought over their head chef and 3 sous chefs straight from Beijing, I must say I've developed better appreciation for the traditional standards that they make great efforts to uphold. Their gorgeous menu looks and feels like a huge story book, and the prices are what you would expect to pay for higher-end Chinese cuisine; so nothing out-of-the-world here."}
{"text":"After a whole year of renovation, QJD finally opened its doors. The outside of the resto looks super chic but the inside is far far from it.  It was just plain and ordinary. 

Looking past the interior because it is about the food after all but it too was just ordinary for the price we are paying.  Be warned, you will be paying fine dinning prices to eat here. We opted for the $118 Peking set and ordered 4 other entrees.  The duck was served as a peony flower on a portrait.  I love the artistic presentation and it was good for pictures but I'm not sure if it's worth the extra $30 from their regular set.  Yes, you also get extra buns but it's too thick to eat with the duck imo. The crepe is wayyyyy better.  Now on to the entrees, it was good but the average price is about $20 to $25!!! Can you imagine paying $20 for for veggie or small plate of meat? 

Our bill was $350 before tips for lunch! It was an interesting experience but don't think I will be back here unless I really want to impress someone."}
{"text":"First of all I have to say that our server George was extremely friendly and welcoming. We order the peking duck was very good.  The smoke fish I have to say was just amazing. Havent had any smoke fish like this for a long time. The fried bamboo shoot tip just perfect. But the taro hot toffee was just speechless. Overall, service was great food was amazing highly recommend this."}
{"text":"I think we have to go through many times to give a fair assessment. I have already been to 3 or 4 times. Every time I go there are new surprises. The first is the price. The average person is 50+ but it is definitely worth the money. There is no one of the most authentic roast ducks in the country. (Better than Da Yali for sure) The home cooking is also very delicious. The next thing that made me amazing was seafood. It wasn't bad at all for friends gatherings. Ask customers to eat... Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Having to experience some high end food really brought my day up! until I looked at the bill... I would have to say that the food was amazing! 
My #1 favourite thing would be there peking duck! But for $88.... the place is way to over priced for foods that you would normally find in other Chinese restaurants. 
If you were to consider coming here, I would actually only recommend the peking duck because the peking duck they make, barely has any fat, and is crispy on the skin. If you were to come here for anything else, I wouldn't recommend it. Only!!! Because you can find anything else at other Chinese restaurants.
Also, the date pastry that's shaped into little ducks, is a big fat NONO. 6 for $20??? It wasn't even good. It was way to hard but it was fun to  eat (since it was the shape of a duck)."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for a birthday dinner. We made the reservation one day prior and were able to get a table, although we had to settle for a super early time (5 PM).

The restaurant is spacious, bright and clean, and is obviously meant to be more of an upscale restaurant. I liked some of the unique touches they had, namely the floral centrepieces on each table and the little duck-shaped chopsticks holders. 

Because our dinner time was so early, the restaurant was not very busy, so there were a lot of empty tables and staff who were just idling around with nothing to do. On the one hand, it was good because they were very attentive towards us, but I also noticed some staff clustered together along one side the room just chatting to each other, and it seemed a bit unprofessional to me.

We obviously had to order the duck, and we got the premium \"peony duck\" set which, if you aren't already aware, is the dish that's all over Instagram where the duck slices are arranged in the shape of a flower. At $118, this is one DAMN expensive duck... and the only main differences I can tell between this and the other premium set ($88) is a) the way the duck is presented; and b) the 6 little sesame buns you get with the peony set. Apparently the peony duck is also larger - 8 lbs vs 4 lbs for the other set. I thought the duck was fine and it was better than what I've had at some other places (but also not distinguishable from duck at other, cheaper places), but was it mind-blowing and worth $118? I don't think so. Especially given that they don't make a second dish out of the remaining duck (e.g. lettuce wraps). They just cut up the rest of the duck and give it to you to eat however you want. They also package up the duck bones for you to take home and make soup. I will say though that the duck is quite large and filling, and they give you a lot of flour wraps (24) which is plenty. The sesame buns are... kind of terrible. I am not sure if it was because we let them sit and cool for too long (we were too focused on the duck), but I found the buns to be very very dry and unpleasant.

I am not sure if they do this with both duck sets, but they did a mini... ceremony thing when our duck rolled out, where they hit a little gong and said some Chinese phrases that went over my head. It was kind of cute and entertaining though.

We also got the braised Japanese tofu cake with scallop sauce ($16.99), plain stir fried peeled shrimps ($28.99) and the sweet and sour pork ($21.99). The sweet and sour pork is definitely not worth it because it's just standard sweet and sour pork, except plated beside a hollowed-out pineapple... like, thanks for charging me an extra $15 for that. The shrimps were good and tasted fresh, were light in flavour, and were not too oily. I also really liked the tofu - the batter around each piece of tofu was very light, and the scallop sauce was delicious and savoury.

This is the kind of place that's cool to try once if you have a special occasion, but I wouldn't return here regularly. Overall though I had a pretty pleasant experience, and everyone in my party seemed to enjoy it."}
