{"text":"It was fine I have a favorite place that I go to, but this place delivers to my work. I had the Sweet and Sour Pork and the Kung Pao chicken both were very tasty and had lots of meat the lady who took my order needed to speak a little better English but I was called back by another lady who verified my order and address it was correct and the delivery driver was very sweet and nice. I had a very nice meal and great customer service. I will definitely call them back. Thanks Best Wok for taking care of me."}
{"text":"The food here is very decent. My favorite here is the lo mein, it's so tasty. Even better than panda expresses IMO. Although the service here is crappy and the servers are sometimes rude I'll still order pickup for some fast yummy Chinese food."}
{"text":"Called in an order to be delivered to me at work for lunch. Driver arrived with my order and became frustrated when I was getting my money out of my pocket to pay him. He told me that he had other customers to get to and he couldn't waste his time waiting for me. No customer service skills at all. The food was just as bad as his attitude!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Phoenix. This restaurant was my family's favorite. Their fried rice and noodle were the best.  My kids favorite was sesame chicken. Service was great. They were really nice people. I could go back to Phonex for just visiting Best Wok. I really miss them."}
{"text":"More like Worst Wok Buffet. This place I will never return in my life. It took 5 minutes just to get a drink. Than a big group came in after us and they were taking their order before me and my boyfriends. Just horrible service. Needless to say we paid for our drink and left. I wish I could rate this place NO stars."}
{"text":"Nasty beef lo main #nasty egg rolls taste like theres curry and something else....oh no meat when we came"}
{"text":"Just ordered from this place and the food is awesome. I didn't dine in, just got it delivered to my room. Service was fast,food was hot and beer was cold. Really good Chinese food and beer delivered...what more could I ask for."}
{"text":"Living right up the street we order out a lot. The staff is always so welcoming and nice and they have such amazing food!!"}
{"text":"I called for a delivery. The lady was nice but they where trying to overcharge me. I called back so I could figure our why it was so much. I should have known it was a bad sign. I get a call from the driver. Our apartments have a map with all the units and locations at the office. He was at the front office. So when I walked out on in my PJs I noticed he was just sitting there in his truck not even bothering to leave his truck and look at the map. I forgot my card inside my apartment. He says \" should I follow you?\" Hello yes you should follow. Its a delivery right? So he parks in front I walk out and he is still in the truck. We did the payment outside. I had to carry everything inside in my PJs. Why did I tip him Idk. They also forgot my drink. I never had a problem before. I just won't order from them again.  I try to give great customer service at my job and its very frustrating when I can't get some great service when I am the customer."}
{"text":"Well, not a big choice of dishes, maybe 20 at all. And it is not easy to find meat in virtually all of them. But price can beat it all, of course. And they have authentic Chinese Tsingtao beer! ($3/12 oz bottle). And I got a good fortune cookie from them :)"}
{"text":"The price here is the main draw: $4.25 for lunch and $4.99 for dinner. The place itself  is old but somewhat decently maintained. The seats in the booths, while clean, have become too soft with age, so choose to sit at the regular tables so you don't sink too low on your seats. The array of dishes offered is not extensive, but what they do offer are adequate for a decent meal. There are hits such as the chop suey and misses such as the sweet-sour chicken with too much batter. In all, you can get a decent but not great meal here, and the price certainly is attractive especially if you're on a very tight budget."}
{"text":"Orange chicken yum!  Under $5 lunch combos! Hot fresh good tasting food.   Pop in for a quick lunch.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered Hot n Sour Soup, House Lo Mein and Pineapple Fried Rice. The soup and Lo Mein was outstanding. They put chicken and prawn in their hot n sour soup which I've seen before and its a great compliment! The rice was good as well. Everything tasted fresh.  Delivery was really fast too! I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Returned to Phoenix last week to close on our new home. Came back here for dinner and again had a wonderful meal. This time we ordered the honey walnut shrimp...I ATE THE WHOLE THING! YUM! Can't wait till our move is complete and we can come as often as we want."}
{"text":"Nothing special but the location was perfect, right across the street from my regular hotel in Phoenix and right next store to my new find on my nail place. This place used to have a buffet, but I never visited then. I ordered a two flavor. You can pick chicken and chicken or beef and beef or seafood and seafood.. and so on. The chicken dishes were $10. I chose chicken and snow peas and general tso's chicken. It was 107 outside, so I wasn't looking for too spicy. The chicken in the snow pea dish was okay.  It had plenty of snow peas with onions and carrots. The General Tso's chicken was crispy and the sauce was tangy with a bite, but not too spicy...served with steamed rice. The portions were nice enough to have an entire meal again of leftovers or perfect to split with someone else.  The only downfall I could see about this place is the name. You expect to see a buffet when you walk in. It is family owned and there is table service. They have lunch specials as well for $5 served until 3:30. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Not the best. No \"Cat\" on the menu but as basic as it gets. A family operation and, right down to grandma and the grandchildren, everyone is super nice. Good in a pinch and the portions are a good value at $5.99 for lunch. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Not located the best looking strip mall but it's actually pretty quiet. I live right around the corner so I drop in here all the time.They updated the interior recently and it's a bit more comfy now. They got rid of the buffet, which I was sad about at first, but I honestly think the food has gotten better and fresher since they did. It's consistently pretty good, but I can't say it's amazing -  if you're craving Chinese this will definitely get you what you want at a pretty good price."}
{"text":"I am convinced these reviews are fake or paid for.  I counted on yelp for real reviews. These people's taste buds are broken."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service. Amazing orange chicken and house low mein! Nice perks for orders over $20. The order was to go,  it was a large order and it was ready in 10 minutes! I live a little too far for delivery, but I know people who order delivery regularly and they have nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"Bad service, waitress had to grab the cook to take your order and she never checks on you. Not quality food at all. Ordered a Mongolian beef dish... it was more like Mongolian onion. All onion no beef, over priced in general and you certainly don't get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Best local Chinese food store!! They do delivery service that is the best thing I like, woke up at 2 pm don't wanna get to cook. Make one call and 15 mins later delicious foods got delivered to door step, cheap price and I lazy to cook so good for me"}
{"text":"Ok it's been a year since I last reviewed best wok,    They only got worse in the last year especially if you order for take out/ delivery. The teriyaki checked didnt even have teriyaki sauce, it was a brown watery sauce like watered down sauce used on beef and broccoli.   The chicken chop suet could use salt as it was tasteless also,  the beef pepper was just ok but half of the peppers were unripe green bell peppers so the tast just isn't what is was 2 or even 1 year ago."}
{"text":"This place surprised the hell out of me. The wife and I stopped here after a late class, and ordered the #66 (Four Seasons). The interior was plain and simple but clean. And the plaza which it's located has seen better days. But our food came out hot and fresh. The beef was tender and so was the chicken. As a matter of fact the pork and shrimp were fresh also. The pricing was decent. This place is a true hidden gem. Out of all the places in the area, this has the best and freshest food hands down."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and they even deliver to my office. Will definitely be ordering more from them in the future."}
{"text":"I'm traveling through town. The hits front desk staff recommended Best Wok. I struggled with the $12 minimum order. I can't eat that much food alone and I'm only here one night, but I did it. I ordered cashew shrimp. It came with zero cashews."}
{"text":"The potstickers were plump and juicy, the shrimp still tender, the kung pao not too spicy, the vegetables nicely done not mushy, and they deliver.  All in all a great find.  When I'm in town and feeling like some americanized chinese comfort food I'll definitely be willing to call Best Wok again."}
{"text":"5.25 is a deal you cant judge. The 2 and 3 star reviews are sick. Its the perfect quick cheap chinese take out. Service is friendly local family oriented. Better than Panda or any other fast food chinese straight up."}
{"text":"Stop by this place since we were staying down the block and needed some food. The place is minimal and nothing special, but what does make this special is their staff and of course their food, it is not great, but just good enough to fulfill your need of Buffet Chinese Food, they have many selections, i would have to say about 20 different offerings, i have never seen any buffet offer Egg Foo Young and that was such a great treat only because i love the dish.   The staff is great, there was this young fella that made us feel welcomed and there was this female that was great too in serving us new drinks and asking if anything was alright.   I think we ended up paying under $7 for the food and free refills on the drink, they also offer beer, i thought that was a added touch to their establishment.   So if your near this place, and are hungry for from Chinese Food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food! You want something tasty? Go here! Big portions and my favorite part.. THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE! I love these guys!"}
{"text":"Me wife n I went to Best Wok noonish to take advantage of the lunch special. ($5.25). We were the only customers at the time. The booth seats are very far from the table so we had to sit on the front edge of the seat. Get a table. I got the Mongolian beef, the better half chose the broccoli beef. They come with an egg roll or crab puff and steamed or fried rice. Well, for $5.25 you can't really expect too much but holy cow cut back on the sauce. Both our meals were drenched in this cloyingly sweet sauce and unable to taste the food. Think next time, if any, we'll ask for it on the side. We made a half hearted effort to eat as not to offend them and asked for doggie bags after awhile. The following day we decided to eat it for our lunch. Actually it was a little better cuz the sauce had thinned and drained to the bottom. Oh well, for $10.50 plus $3.00 tip it still wasn't worth it. I had to ask one of the family for our check. They seem to be doing a brisk take out business so apparently people like it. Prob not going back though. The egg rolls were very good. Seemed house made and some how avoided the sauce."}
