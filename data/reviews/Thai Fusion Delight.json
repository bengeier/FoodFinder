{"text":"They're doing it right. I'm so pleased that a place like this opened in my hood.   I've been eating here every couple weeks since it opened, and it hasn't let me down yet. Today I tried the Ginger Stir fry, and it is certainly going to be my goto dish.   The lady running the place is a sweetheart, and I hope her all the success in the world.   Check it out"}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I got the Tom Yum, Pad Thai, spring rolls, satay beef and macaroons for dessert. Everything was amazing and very authentic. I ordered 3 macaroons and the staff member gave me one for no cost! This is the second time we have ordered from here and will continue to do so. Thai Fusion Delight also called us after to see how we enjoyed the food which is such impeccable service! I would  for sure recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nice little take out place. Pad Thai was really good. Hot and fresh.  Staff very friendly. Would recommend it especially for 17th ave area."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm so happy it's close to work. Food is a great value and has always been excellent quality. Try the Thai poutine! It sounds strange, but it's so good! Staff is always super nice so I'm happy to support them."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  The mother-daughter team (I think?) running this place are reason enough to go. They're really  forgiving when it comes to making accomadations and the food is delicious. It's one of those local businesses you'll take pleasure in supporting."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious!!! We stopped by because we live three blocks away and were blown away by authentic flavour and friendly staff! A great selection of real Thai dishes, both unusual and Classic. We will be coming here regularly! YUM."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with my order through skip the dishes.  I was really looking forward to some good Thai and a hot tom yum soup on a cold winter night. I ordered Tom Yum Soup with Tofu (and put in the notes Vegetarian Tom Yum) but received Tom Kha soup with no tofu.  The vegetables were old looking and did not taste fresh.   The Vegetarian Delight portion for $11 was a small portion and once again, old looking / tasting vegetables.   The Pineapple friend rice with pork (which had 3 pieces of pork) was not a very nice flavor at all. Paying $43 for what we received was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and fast. The lady's that work there are the kindest, realist, hardiest workers. I'm never mad at giving them my money."}
{"text":"Finally, cheap, amazing Thai in the beltline. I'm a recent transplant from Toronto where Thai is the go-to cheap and delicious take out food and Thai Fusion Delight is a neighbourhood gem. Don't miss this one! Really good food, really nice staff, really good prices."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My friend and I go to this place and the staff is very friendly. The food exudes a homecooked vibe. Since the place opens at 11, my friend and I waited for them to open just outside of the store. But as soon as the staff saw us, she hurried to the door to open earlier for us! The portions are a great bang for your buck. Staff also gives my friend and I free treats like fruits when there is just us in the store. My friend and I both felt so welcome because of the hospitable service we received. The food is great too! I've tried the basil fried rice, pineapple rice (? ), sweet and sour pork - its amazing how their dishes have consistency in the great flavours that play in my mouth. My friend tried the paneng curry with some coconut rice and the flavours balance perfectly! The spice from the curry blends well with the creamy coconut rice. I would totally tell all my friends about this place. Awesome awesome! Shoutout to the great staff that are always nice!"}
{"text":"I love any restaurant that does good deep fried rice cream. And this place delivers (literally - for $6! But more on that later). Deep fried ice cream with almond slivers and caramel topping? Yum!  I love that this place has online ordering (and delivery) and makes it super easy with a nice big link on their website. Online ordering is the best. I can see all my meat options for each menu item, add in any requests for each item and even pick my spiciness levels. Plus I can track my delivery online to know when I need to be ready to answer the door. On crutches. But that's another story. Delivery is $6 with no minimum order, and it arrived in just under an hour.  Aside from the deep fried ice cream ($5.50) I also had the Basil Chilli Pepper Stirfry (with beef, $13.20) and Basil Fried Rice (with chicken, $13.20). Both were good, but I still prefer the equivalents from Thai Bistro (who didn't have a driver on that night). Both dishes came with generous amounts of chunky veggies which I really liked (makes me feel healthier).  Overall, a quality Thai option that's open daily for lunch and dinner (except Mondays when they're closed and Saturday lunches). Plus did I mention the deep fried ice cream and delivery? It's just what we all need sometimes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I regularly order here and it has definitely turned into our favourite place for Thai take-out. The food is always delicious and definitely cheaper than ordering take-out from a sit-down Thai restaurant. The ladies who run it are sooo friendly and cheerful. We don't really like using 3rd party delivery sites so we always order directly from them and we haven't had any issues with our orders. Definitely one of our go-to take-out spots in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great Thai good ,great Thai dessert ,must try !!! The place is clean , brand new . You can order the food to go or sit there at the restaurant. The staff is friendly . Warm welcome  I would recommend this place for the Thai-food lover ;)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed it a lot! I've had Thai food from Thailand and obviously the authenticity isn't exact, but overall, absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"My favourite new Thai spot! Alway good food and friendly service. Ginger chicken stir fry is my go too dish. All the curries are packed full of flavor"}
{"text":"This place is our weekly go-to for Thai. Unlike other places that are very expensive, with small portion sizes, this place is EVERYTHING.   Authentic. Very reasonable prices. Great portions. Everything is delicious. Fast. Hot. Great selection. Great service.  Deep fried ice cream is amazing. Musaman curry is perfect. Cashew chicken very delicious. Pad Thai is great but sometimes a tad on the dry side (ask for extra sauce on the side so you can customize to taste). They are always accommodating for special requests.  The only downside is that they're not open on Mondays. Sigh."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast. Delicious authentic Thai food. Open late too. The pumpkin custard is unforgettable as well as the beef salad."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Thai diner in town.  The little old lady in the kitchen certainly knows what she's doing.  Looking forward to trying more dishes.  Yum Nuea Nam Tok (Thai steak salad)...5 stars.  Marinated grilled flank steak (I think) with red onions, cilantro, stoned/crushed roasted rice, mint leaves and lime juice. The steak was sliced in bite-sized strips and was nice and tender. The herb dressing was loaded with flavor. This is a dish that definitely needs a side of carbs or greens...some sticky rice (preferred), steamed/fried rice, or lettuce would be perfect.  Satay Skewers (chicken)...5 stars.  Lightly grilled curry-marinated chicken skewers. Perfectly cooked chicken and super tender.  The peanut sauce was equally light but flavorful.  This is one of the best Thai chicken skewers you'll ever have!  Poutine Thai Style...4 stars.  If you enjoy thai curry then you'll enjoy this dish.  It's curry that you can eat with your fingers.  It's a no brainer cause the fries are just like the potatoes in the broth.  The fries are perfectly cooked and golden brown.    Spring rolls...4 stars.  Golden brown and crispy.  Not as flavorful but perfectly fired.  Pad Thai (chicken)...5 stars.  Excellent.  Not too saucy and still has lots of flavor.  Just a light and well balanced dish, the way it should be.  Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken...4 stars. Nice and flavorful. The dish has a darker hue and heavier than what I'm use to but tasted very good.  Sweet Sticky Rice with Thai Custard...2 stars.  This is the only let down, thus far. A generous portion of sticky rice and custard but, unfortunately, lacking in flavor...they both needed more palm sugar and coconut milk. The rice only had a hint of sweetness and coconut, and the custard was just tasteless.  There was also no sweet coconut dressing, which would've helped the dish. Hopefully they can fix this as there is no other place in town that'll give you this much sweet sticky rice and custard."}
{"text":"A bright, clean Thai takeaway spot with some bar seating. It's not the kind of place you would go for a sit down dinner, but if you need some quick tasty Thai food with a place to sit down, Thai fusion delight might be up your alley.  I ordered some takeaway red curry with chicken, coconut rice and a Pad Thai over the phone and it was ready in about 10 minutes. You can order each type of curry, red, yellow, green and panang with chicken, beef or pork at mild -spicy spice levels. The ladies working the place were freaky friendly. They flashed piece signs as I yelped my way through the restaurant snapping photos of everything.  They've also got a parking lot which is a great feature if you need to drive to 17ave to get your food. Everything arrived home cleanly and piping hot.   The fusion items like Thai poutine looked really interesting and give them something you won't find elsewhere. I'm excited to try these interesting fusion items soon when I'm in the mood.  By no means the best Thai I've ever had, but well worth it for the price point and ease of ordering. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to order from here again of it was the closest place."}
{"text":"You guys. Do not sleep on this place. It's kinda tucked away and never has anyone in it, so it looks possibly sketchy but holy CRAP it's good. Where do I even start? The curry was fresh and sharp. The thai poutine (mine was w/ peanut sauce) was AMAZING. The chicken wings were hearty and seasoned perfectly.   I will be BACK. It's best for take-out, on your way home from work or whatever. There aren't a lot of seats. Folks need to step 10 paces from National and The Ship and try something new. It'll change yer friggin life."}
{"text":"best pad thai by far in the city!!!! They do have limited business hours tho"}
{"text":"I am a Absolutely disgusted in the service and food. I ordered soup (17.00) and a stir fry with jasmine rice. The total was 48.98 as you will are from my photos the soup was only half portion. Yup 17.00 for that .. the stir fry was as you can see from the photos was a minimal portion size. I called the restaurant and he says too bad (owner) there is a no money back policy."}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out from here via skip the dishes...it's become our GO TO Thai place!! Spring rolls, pad Thai and green curry over coconut rice are our staples. Always good...prob 5 orders and all have been great! The green curry is so flavourful and comes with lots of sauce! I find them to be extremely decent priced. Seriously, try this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this restaurant on a couple occasions as I live nearby. I absolutely love the pad thai and the spring rolls, I've always been pleased with the flavor/portion sizes/prices. However I was so disappointed with my most recent delivery experience that I don't think I'll be ordering from them anymore.  One of the main dishes we had ordered was missed. I double-checked to ensure I had ordered correctly and then called Thai Fusion Delight to hopefully fix the error and get my dinner. I was put on with the owner and we worked out that they would send my missing dish as soon as possible. All was good so I settled in for a wait, this was New Years Eve so I knew they'd be busy but I knew it was coming.   About 15 minutes later I got another call from Thai Fusion Delight saying that their delivery service was \"closed\" and there was nothing else they could do for me. They offered me a refund of the dish that was missing, however for the inconvenience of then having to drive myself to McDonald's (in the snow) after watching everyone else enjoy their Thai food, I feel like the refund I got didn't make up for a situation that was purely the resteraunt's error.  I feel like the quality of delivery service has notably gone down since the switch from SkipTheDishes to JustEat and as long as this is how they're going to handle deliveries, I doubt I'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"As far as Thai places go, this is the best one so far. They have a home-cooked quality to their food while balancing quick service for take out or dine in. Lovely friendly cook. And a full menu of well loved Thai dishes keeps one happy no matter what mood you are in. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after recalling Dale mentioning this and glad he did because it's easy to miss it being tucked in a corner in a very tight plaza w/ about 10 parking stalls, most of which seems to be for that lounge Puss or Purr, can't remember but I digress.  It's totally geared towards takeout or a few ppl eating in as long as they don't mind the bar-style along the walls; think of it as a donair type of setting but no tables.  Ordered the pad thai, and I couldn't believe how heavy this dish was, not even comparing to back home---and the value, $12!?  This can easily feed 2 hungry ppl.  Noodles cooked just right, not too dry, and liked how the tofu was cut into cute little cubes...and a generous plating of cilantro and green onions.    Totally authentic, as the chef actually set up Khao San Thai down the street :)  My next venture will be their famous deep fried ice-cream, hopefully tonite.  Just been open 2 months, great start."}
{"text":"When I feel for some fried rice noodle(pad thai) this is my favorite place.  It's just perfect here.  I like it spicy and with only just a little bit of sweetness and with lots of peanuts.  Be sure to let the chef know how you like it and she will be more than happy to accommodate your tastebuds."}
{"text":"I spent two months in Germany this past September and October, and one happy discovery there (a thing I'd avoided on my many past trips because I thought they'd be uniformly terrible) was the excellent, freshly prepared, authentic, and CHEAP Thai food in the cities there. I returned home to Calgary on Halloween 2014 and the next day threw a bone at the new Thai Fusion Delight hoping to recapture some of that German \"Schnell-Imbiss\" Thai excellence, and this place does it perfectly. Portions are huge and fantastic value, remarkably so for Calgary, the dishes are layered and complex, flavours are mostly spot on (you might want to ask for extra spicy), everything is made to order by real Thai people...I could go on and on. Kao Soi is as good as at any sit-down resto in town and much cheaper, about half as pricey and just as good as at the excellent Khao San up the street. That's my fave dish along with the crispy chicken with basil, addictive. We need a hundred more places like this in Calgary but this is a start. With this and Watercress Express bookending Uptown 17th I'm a lucky man!"}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, and great service! I was hesitant to try this place because White Elephant is very highly rated here and very disappointing but Thai Fusion Delight is amazing and the price is right! The one thing that doesn't make sense to me is why they would sell fried ice-cream when there's barely any seating there? By the time I got home (with my takeout about 10-15mins away), the ice-cream was mostly melted. Anyway, their green curry was delicious, so was their mango sticky rice, and their fried ice-cream despite it being melted. I find that thai food is overpriced in Calgary, and they're nothing special. This place is fair though. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I am a thai food nut, and if I could have it my way, I would put coconut milk in most things. My husband on the other hand is not a fan. But I was able to convince him to get takeway from here by batting my eyelashes.  I was having trouble finding their menu, but saw they were on skip the dishes so tried ordering through that website to much difficulty. I realized, this is dumb, I now have the menu, I am just going to call them.  So call them I did, I ordered the tom kha soup, a green curry, pad thai and coconut rice.You have your choice of what meat (or no meat) you want to add to each of the dishes. I went for all chicken.  I enjoyed everything immensely! Though my husband said I was feeding him 'milky soup with twigs in it'. I told him that is just the lemongrass and thai basil.  He wasn't impressed, but I really was happy with the offerings as well as the price for the amount of food. So if you like thai food to begin with, you will not be disappointed. Very happy to have this handy takeaway spot in my neighbourhood!"}
