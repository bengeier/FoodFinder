{"text":"Nice hidden spot. First off, you cannot expect too much. This is not an all you can eat buffet with plenty of servers nor a five star fine dining sushi place in downtown. The owner/cook does all the things by himself on most days, so some patience is needed. Serving portion is OK (not big...just enough) but more importantly the food is TASTY - we had dynamite roll, spider roll and bulgogi. Only thing is that...need some ventilation or new ac unit, it can get stuffy in there. Will come again."}
{"text":"Attended with 6 work colleagues for lunch.  While the food was acceptable the service for 6 at our table was slow.  At the end of our meal when the bill was brought out we paid individually and the waitresses complained about the fact that there were too many coins (loonies and toonies and about 3dollars in quarters) definitely not more than 10 dollars total in change on a bill of approximately $90.00 before tip.  They were quite rude about it.  I would not return for the slow service and the very rude staff. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great price service is slow as its a family place with limited staff.  Got there take your time and enjoy your food"}
{"text":"Great find for the neighbourhood. John is very friendly and makes a good spider roll. However lost a star because the avocado in my roll was brown. Otherwise it was very tasty. I always try the spider roll every time I try a new sushi joint and very often am disappointed. This time my only disappointment was the avocado. I'll be back to try the green dragon roll with confidence the avocado on that roll will be green."}
{"text":"Take out only.  Etobicoke is serverely lacking in adequate, let alone good Japanese restaurants.  I waited almost an hour (at 2 pm on a saturday) for a simple chicken terriyake, california roll and veggie tempura order.  There were (inexplicably) 6 other tables/groups of people waiting for their orders. Several walked out because of the wait, even though they ordered before arriving.  The servings were small. The rolls were sloppy. The tempura was just adequate. The chicken was very dry (on a bed of onions?) and the tempura sauce was thin and flavourless.  The salad was tiny and the dressing was just bad. The miso soup was ok. I had to ask 5 times for Uni (which they didn't have even though it was on the menu); the chef kept trying to give me a loonie (?!?) This is the 3rd Japanese restaurant I've tried in Etobicoke, and I'm tired of being ripped off."}
{"text":"Always seen the place by my house and never went in. I'm glad I did, this small family run place has amazing tasting sushi, sashimi, and rolls all at a good price. Really recommend going for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in and the owner was very friendly. I ordered the veggie rolls and my husband got the sashimi plate. The food was fresh and tasty.  I enjoyed the miso soup and the prices were very reasonable also. I would recommend the lunch menu also he is open seven days a week 11-11"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. I am not one to normally write reviews but I just had to sign up on Yelp in order to give this local business some well-deserved recognition. We live around the area and have always seen this place on Main St. but never actually gone in....we were definitely missing out! The food is to die for. Sushi and sashimi are very noticeably fresh. Portions are generous for the price you pay, not to mention the plating is spectacular.   What always makes or breaks it for me is the service. The staff including the chef are extremely friendly and attentive, never overbearing. My boyfriend and I are sushi fanatics and we've tried every single sushi place in Newmarket. We normally go to AYCE but after discovering this place, this will be our new spot.   If you are looking for a reasonably priced sushi restaurant in the York Region area with high quality, this is it! Has a MI-NE feel to its dishes. Doesn't get better than that! We will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"Unspeakably bad!!! Do not eat here.    Ordered 3 boxes to go including salmon and sushi. Nothing complicated. After a 45 minute wait. Yep 45 minutes despite being the only customer, I brought my food home.   I will always try to find something good to say. Tonight I can't.   The hot food was cold, and the miso tasted off. I would not let my kids even try it.   The salmon was covered in a thick gloppy sauce designed I am sure to mask the oldness  of the salmon.   The salad was brown and tasteless and the tempura was doughy greasy and cold.   The fish in the sushi was smelly and definitely had gone bad. We had to throw it out.   We actually threw out 70% of our order  and finished dinner with peanut butter sandwiches.   Never again"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Mississauga! Great prices and huge portions. The people working were also super kind! The yam, advocodo and california rolls were amazing!"}
{"text":"Desperately hungry, we decided to stop at this place because we wanted to eat sashimi. We noticed the floor and tables appeared greasy and the place smelled unclean.   Ordered salmon and tuna sashimi with our mouths watering. As soon as the owner placed the plate of fish in front of us, we knew something was wrong.  The tuna looked liked it had been shredded or recycled from another person's uneaten plate. It smelled so fishy and rotten that I wouldn't dare eat it. My girlfriend took 1 quick bite and immediately spat it out. The salmon didn't look \"bad\" but it was very difficult to eat since we were disgusted by the rotten tuna. It was also thinly sliced.  We got out of there as quickly as possible after paying without complaining to the owner who was actually a friendly guy. We just couldn't imagine how a restaurant owner could have the nerve to serve rotten fish to customers.  Never going back and definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great. Mmmmmm. The price is right.   Atmoshpere is ok. Nothing special. Small and cozy.   Menu is good but limited.  Staff is super friendly.   If you are looking for good sushi and are not concerned about the atmosphere, I would recommend Sushi for you."}
{"text":"This is really excellent sushi and at a great price. My wife ate there one night and raved about it despite the outward appearance (we'd seen it on Main Street a few months earlier and did not like the tacky signage) as well as the friendly service. So we just had it again for takeout. My gosh it was good.   Really fresh fish and they gave us tons. I think it was 15 pieces of sushi for $12 or something.   I'm only writing this review so they get the recognition they deserve. Please fix your self your sign though. It doesn't reflect the quality of your food!"}
{"text":"We don't often eat sushi at smaller restaurants because of the lack of options for vegetarians, but Sushi 4 U makes an amazing (large) Veg Dragon Roll which keeps us coming back.   The owners are very warm, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Again, this is one restaurant that I've only ever enjoyed as takeout.  Their sushi is great and their California rolls are some of the best I've had.  They've never charged extra for not including or substituting for a certain type of sushi (I'm not fond of shrimp) I have no complaints, especially when they ask my husband for my written order since they like my printing! ;-D"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been to. I've been to a lot of sushi places. The service is incredible, my family and I are regulars there to the point of a name by name basis. They treat us like family! They know all our orders by heart and take it the extra mile by occasionally tossing in a free dish. The food is incredible. To die for. Not once have I ever gotten food poisoning from eating here. The food is delicious, made by professional chefs who are also very friendly. 10/10!"}
{"text":"Went in for a few rolls on the fly and wasn't dissapointed. Both the prices and quality do not speak to such a small location. You won't pay small shop prices, but the quality is excellent!  I opted for a classic dynamite roll and then tried the chefs signature green roll. Nicely sliced avocado and a great spicy mayo made this one a favourite of mine.   The chef is from Tokyo and visits Toronto for years at a time to escape the hustle and bustle of japan. Go enjoy some authentic sushi !"}
{"text":"Our table of 2 were the only customers on a Monday night for about 2 hours... eek. Customer service was very good, as it is run by hospitable Korean people, however, I felt the food was quite mediocre.  Got a sashimi bento box for $11.99 which came with 3 pieces of california roll, ~12 pieces of assorted sashimi, rice, salad, and miso soup. Unfortunately, the salad was over-sauced, drenching all the lettuce to make it almost soggy. The miso soup was extremely salty and made me wolf down lots of tea. The sashimi, frankly, I've tasted better.   Even though the people were very nice, it is really hard to remain competitive with this calibre of sushi for this price. I think lack of customers could probably explain the quality of the fish.  Sadly, I will not return as there are just many other sushi options you could choose in Mississauga."}
{"text":"THe staff is friendly but The food was average. Edamame came with lots of salt on it, the california roll had a funny taste and sashimis were ok. Before going to this place you should know that you will get out with a disgusting smell on your clothes. I am in town for few days and my jacket, my scarf and The outfit I was wearing all smell so bad ."}
{"text":"We were looking for a decent sushi spot for take-out in Milton and based on reviews decided to get something on our way home. The restaurant seems family run which I am a supporter of. Even if it's not the vibe seemed low-key. Based on the menu you can tell they are dedicated to just sushi. Sushi 4 U has in my opinion affordable a la carte options for sushi, which is nice if you want to try something new but the appetizers seemed over-priced. Although there wasn't many people in the restaurant the men behind the sushi bar were super busy. We then noticed that they were making deliveries.   We tried the spicy lover maki, dynamite maki, spicy tuna maki and special fried chicken maki. Favourite roll was the spicy lover maki  we also ordered spring rolls(4) which were pretty small and basic for the price (probably won't order again).   Our bill came to $28 after the 10% discount for take out.   For as long as I can remember (well over 10 years) I remember seeing this place but never managed to try it. I'm glad I did and we will be back... to bad  they don't deliver to Milton"}
{"text":"This is a small place, but it's clean and I liked the large order board.  The staff were friendly. I tried take out.  Ordered sashimi bento and bulgogi tempura box. The ingredients were fresh and they didn't over salt the soup. The sashimi was decent. Good size portions. The tempura stayed crispy even after the trip home.   Portion size was filling without stuffing me. This was a good spot that I will try again. Next time I'll give the sushi a try."}
{"text":"Due to a long night working at the office, we chose to order in sushi for dinner. Honestly, my expectations were quite low - but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality! The fish isn't amazing, but the rolls and nigiri are much well executed than many other places.  The sashimi is decent, with fatty salmon bits and lean tuna. The butterfish was underwhelming. The rolls were okay, but to be honest, I only had the salmon maki (which kind of fell apart), and didn't try the dynamite roll. The shrimp nigiri and other nigiri were also okay - there wasn't too much rice, and the rice wasn't mushy nor vinegary.   The avocado salad also has a generous portion of avocado. Unfortunately, I didn't take pictures; however, there were around 10 slices of avocado per salad. The edamame was boiled in salted water, making it very flavourful. I didn't try the gyoza, but it looked fairly crisp too."}
{"text":"Very delicious food! People are very nice. Chef is kind. Overall clean place, good food and would recommend."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh!  I came at a busy lunch time and my Sashimi bento was quick to arrive, fresh and tasty.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"So I'm at work, hungry...trying to decide what to eat.  I google food delivery in Mississauga and 'Just Eat' comes up.  I type in my postal code and the type of food I was craving and a list of spots came up.  Sushi 4 U was first on the list!  I went through the menu, made my choices and waited for my food to be delivered.  Firstly, it did not take long at all for my food to get here, which was great!  Opened my bag and just the aromas of my food already got my mouth watering.    I'm definitely ordering here again because the quality and the taste of the food was great.  I ordered a green salad, spicy lover maki, Kara maki and big crunchy maki.  I loved all three but my top pick is the big crunchy maki!  After my meal, I was fully satisfied!  Great to know I can go in and eat close by to work or just get it delivered!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, limited selection, mostly bento boxes - not my cup of tea. The service was great though, the owners are adorable and they were so polite, hence the reason for the 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is just fine if you've got a sushi craving. Not a sashimi craving; sushi. Skip the raw fish here and get the great rolls; they come 4 pieces an order so you can grab a variety. I like this a lot; having to commit to just one roll that's 8-10 pieces is a bummer.    Service is always decent and cheerful.  You'll probably want to approach them to pay the bill when you're ready instead of waiting for them to collect your payment.  Prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"Sashimi platter was incredible.   Kamakaze roll for $12 was delicious & generous portion.  Presentation of all food was fantastic.  Chef & staff very friendly.   They let us try a new menu item (spicy chicken very tasty) & complimentary salad, soup, ice cream   Located on trendy downtown Main Street, the interior/decor could use an upgrade to match the caliber of food.    This is a 4.5/5 - only because a 5 is a complete blow away and the decor/slow music/bright lights lacks trendy appeal a tad.  Other than that this is so far our best Sashimi/Sushi experience in Newmarket.   Highly recommend you check them out."}
{"text":"I have been food ranging during my lunch breaks and finally got to try this place.  I ordered take out lunch special sushi. It was alright. Price wise it is a bit higher than most places I have tried with lunch specials. But quality wise it is excellent. The sushi had the right amount of fish to rice ratio, and not loaded with \"cheap\" stuff. Fish tasted pretty fresh.  It's a Korean run place and this generally means better service and less \"cheaping out\" compared with Chinese run sushi places. So the slightly higher prices are justified I guess. It's a fine choice for sushi if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I ordered a few different dishes, and some of them were good.  Pros: yam tempura was crispy and delicious, salmon skin roll was really tasty. Cons: all the salmon used was off, and the smell and taste ruined all the dishes that it was in.   The chef was a very nice and cheerful man, which is why I feel bad that the food was not very good. I'd be willing to go again if I got fresh, good-quality fish."}
{"text":"I walked in the restaurant with a crave for sushi, then I ordered some rolls and veggie tempura. The tempura was a delight. The staff was all nice and friendly people. Definitely a hidden gem of Japanese food in new market!"}
{"text":"Really love eating here. The owners are amazing and the food is incredible. Chef is an artist with his plating. Fresh, good portions and reasonable price. I really hope they are able to make it in this competitive market."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They are always smiling and happy to see you and the sushi is fresh, made out in the front area so you can see it all happen! They have a great menu and I enjoy going there!"}
{"text":"Service is great here, personable and the women running the show is pretty funny. The sushi is great, especially for the pricing. The seating is limited but we've never had issues getting a spot.   They have Korean vanilla and strawberry fish ice cream sandwiches!  Food is always plentiful and water and tea is on the house.   Lots of rolls to choose from and categorized into price brackets instead of all different prices.   One of my go to in the west end of Mississauga for ala carte!"}
{"text":"High quality fresh sashimi restaurant. One of the best in Toronto. Very impressed. Will go again.  Recommend the Chef Choice I think it is."}
{"text":"This place might have been the worst place I've ever eaten at in my life. Ive never written a review of any restaurant I've been to, good or bad, but this one warrants an explanation.   After waiting over half an hour for our order, we take our food and leave. When i tasted the shrimp tempura roll I immediately had to spit it out. It was as if the chef had taken very old shrimp tempura, removed the shrimp, and put the expired deep fried oil into the rolls.  After moving on from the rolls, which I had to throw out, I opened the rest of the bento box. A thin, clearly very old, piece of salmon covered in a very thick gooey paste was the main course of the meal. No chance I was putting that in my mouth.   My mother ordered the green dragon rolls, which had expired avocado and freezing cold expired fish. No thanks!!   I'll never go back here. Trust me! I'm not even a picky eater!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but now it seems like they lack quality in food and lack customer service.  We order delivery at work all the time, and lately theyve always messed up our orders and fail to acknowledge that.  The lady who answers the phone, is constantly rude and doesnt seem to care if we are repeat customers. On one occasion, she flat out refused to come deliver and said we HAVE TO Pick it up, meanwhile we were at work.   When it comes to the sushi, their pieces are overly BIG and u literally have to cut it to eat it.  By then, its a sloppy mess.  We are now looking for a new sushi delivery place around work, to fulfill our sushi needs."}
{"text":"Might be good food unfortunately the kitchen was so slow that we had to take our food to go - they were not able to serve us within 40minutes. In times where one has only a short break for lunch - that would probably be a better solution for dinner or after work."}
{"text":"This is my first time here as I am a new sushi eater. After years of not liking seaweed, I started eating it for health reasons and now I kind of like sushi. Being vegetarian, I had the yam tempura maki roll and sweet potato maki roll. The difference being the latter was topped with avocado. Both were delicious but I doubt my meal was gluten free as the \"tempura\" part rarely is and they did not say that the soy sauce was gf.......so I had a little bloating I still do not eat the ginger or wasabi so my tastes have not matured fully. The staff were very nice and the restaurant was casual and had cute booths that were slightly privatized with wood barriers. My husband ate the dynamite roll and green dragon....the latter being topped with avocado......we love our avocado! The yam roll only gives you 4 pieces. The sweet potato one gives you 6.  The whole meal was around $30 with tax and tip included."}
{"text":"This place is great in terms of taste.  They actually have Japanese servers from what I could tell.  The food wait time is decent and it has tasted fresh both times I went.  The wasabi here was really powerful too!  I had the bento boxes both times and both times I wasn't disappointed.  My girlfriend had the eel rice both times and enjoyed it as well.  I would definitely recommend this place, just be prepared to pay a little more."}
{"text":"I've order only to go so far. Their combo is very worth it! I usually get the salmon teriyaki combo, which come with rice, miso soup, salad and 4 pieces of maki. Delicious and very filling! I suggest to call in and place your order first so you don't have to wait as they get pretty busy for lunch time. Service is always good. The staffs are very friendly. I will try to come back to sit in one day."}
{"text":"This is my most fav sushi place in mississauga, not only cheap but their sushi is always fresh! Service is a bit slow but its worth waiting for!!"}
{"text":"I feel like I might be giving this place a harsh review but their really wasn't anything that stood out to me about this place and with so many better sushi places around I am not sure if I will be coming back here again. I had the bulgogi dinner which came with a miso soup, salad, some California roll, rice and some spring rolls. Everything tastes alright but as I stated before there wasn't anything special about this place."}
{"text":"Is this restaurant still opened? We tried called twice and no answer.  Is good food and great price but no good if the hours stated here is incorrect."}
{"text":"If your looking to have some great quality sushi rolls and sake this is a place to go. It's small but the menu has a big variety of selections of sushi. Vegetarian option are also not ur typical one or two items. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner on a Friday night but was surprised the place was not busy. Good value for the money and food tasted great! Presentation of the food was nice and sashimi/sushi was fresh. The daily special of Spicy chicken bento box was tasty too for only $8.99!  Place is clean and the owners/staff is friendly. Would definitely come back and recommend residents in the area to visit this place! For the quality of food and value, this place should be packed.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 20+ times, and it has been going steadily downhill each time. The last time it took an hour to get our food. An hour. Let that sink in. An hour. And it has happened 3 times now.  When it did come, it was awful. The sushi rice just fell apart. The amount of fish was pitiful.   Never, never again. Ever."}
{"text":"The owner was friendly and gave me a complimentary miso soup when I said that its my first time here. However, the food was worse than I expected. It didn't have any taste! I felt like I was eating air instead of a California roll. Sushi was also not that great, fish was falling off the rice and rice was falling apart. Also dishes were really small, like REALLY small. Like toy version of a real food."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. As one of the very first sushi places I had ever ordered from in middle school, I held a fondness for this place for a long time. Before the new management took over, the owner was incredibly kind and often gave me free hand rolls, and the sashimi bento was always fresh and I usually got a few extra slices of thick buttery salmon just because the staff were familiar with me. A couple years ago, the place was taken over by a new man. My first time returning I was disappointed to find this but hoped for the best. What I got was devastating.  I ordered the roll bento set. It took a solid half hour for my meal to be ready-though I was the only person there and had asked for it to go- and then when I payed I didn't get enough change back. The tuna roll was disgusting- the tuna incredibly old and tasting of dead fish, avocado was brown and rice was hard. The spicy salmon roll upon further inspection contained absolutely NO SALMON, just oily tempura bits with a vague salmon flavor- what the fuck?? Came here again a month or so later with a friend to give him a second chance. No change. I tried to go up to the counter to order because I had been there a long time without any attention and the man demanded I go back to my table and wait to be served, then went back to discussing something with his friend. I left five minutes later and have never gone back."}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants are always hit and miss. However, Sushi For You is a hit!. I have been coming to this small family run sushi restaurant for the the past 5 years and the food service and pricing is great. My only complaint is the dining area is a little small, but if I was rating this place just on food quality and service alone, I would have given them 5  stars.  Try the the 'Sashimi Bento Box'. If you are a fan of sashimi you will love this. The food here is very fresh and the owners here honestly appreciate your business.  There are a lot of sushi restaurants in this area ( I have tried them all) and despite its size (it is a very small restaurant) it comes up big in flavour and value for your money. If you are ever in this 'hood' (Erin Mills Parkway and 401) and have a craving for fresh sashimi, drop by this place, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"After trying over 10 places for sushi in Mississauga, I can safely say this place ranks near the bottom.  I'm not sure how this place has lasted so long.  For the price and quality, it's overpriced.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the service is friendly and polite but that's the only reason why I didn't give it 1 star.  We ordered 2 large sushi sets and we were really turned off by the quality. The sushi rice was mushy and too hot. It was so hot that the tuna started to get opaque. Though it should have cooked the salmon sushi too, it didn't because the salmon was still frozen!! The rolls were no better. They looked so messy. They were filled more with rice than salmon and they were very sloppy. I've never seen maki rolls look so bad before.  The edges were all jagged as if they were using scissors to cut the rolls.  The flavour of the shari (sushi rice) was completely bland as well.  Zero flavouring in addition to being the wrong texture.  The flavours and textures of the fish seemed subpar as well.  There just seems to be a general lack of quality overall in the food.  Save your money and head south for one minute to Sushi in Sushi for some good maki rolls."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant. Both the price and service are very good. Have been there at least 10 times this year alone."}
{"text":"Decided to try Sushi 4 U on Main Street, Newmarket and so glad we did. Amazing value...the portions are super generous for the price. The sushi was very fresh and the dining room atmosphere was comfortable and pleasant. Highly recommend & we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  When I'm going for takeout sushi I always go here.  The sushi is good quality and quite reasonably priced.  It's the best take-out sushi in the area in my opinion.  The staff are always incredibly friendly.  They have expanded the menu to include more than just sushi, but I'm usually there for the sushi."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Sushi For You just to see how it actually tasted like because the reviews have been mixed.  I dropped by for a lunch takeout and was warmly greeted by the staff. They were friendly and knowledgable when I asked them questions. I ordered the sashimi meal which comes with rice, 3 California rolls, miso soup, and salad. I also ordered 6 unagi and cucumber rolls. It didn't take long for my order to be ready.  The sashimi was the only thing I enjoyed. You can't really mess up sashimi. The California rolls had way too much rice. The unagi rolls were average. The salad was a bit drenched and the miso soup was average. I was actually quite disappointed because average/slightly-below average sushi shouldn't cost me $21 and change. That's probably more than ayce lunch."}
