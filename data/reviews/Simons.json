{"text":"Had some time to explore the Fall & Winter fashions. Super helpful staff. 

Yummy hot food in the cafe (so far had the French Onion Soup, Hummas Plate, Breakfast Wrap, Greek Salad, Gelato, Chocolatine, Hot Chocolate, lattes,...)

Simons cafe Eve has a sign that says 'No Tips, we are happy to serve you.' Progressive just like the people that own/run Simons. Staff are paid the same as the other staff in the store so they don't have to worry about tips. Service is efficient, professional and friendly. Service is equal and maybe even superior to service in any of Calgary's finest eateries & restaurants. 

Come on restaurants & cafes, time to follow the lead!"}
{"text":"Terrible service in the men's section today. When a clerk assumes you are buying something for yourself and then proceeds to mumble through the transaction, it doesn't make you want to give them your business. 

Here's what went down. I was purchasing gifts for Christmas, as one does in a mall in December. Took two items to the till and the clerk looks at them and says \"These are too big for you. You need smaller!\" In the rudest tone. I informed the clerk that they are gifts and get a disgusted grunt. 

After being told I didn't have the Simons points card, the clerk mumbled something unintelligible under his breath and scanned my items in. After completing the transaction (in which the clerk barely made eye contact or conversation) I had to ask about both a gift receipt (no dice on that) and a gift box. The gift box he did give me isn't what I needed. Even though he insisted it would fit. I think I'll order my stuff from Simons online from here on out. What little Christmas spirit I had is definitely gone now."}
{"text":"Simons has taken over a significant amount of space between 7th and 8th ave and 3rd street. The layout of the store is quite neat as it's on three levels and includes a cafe and two sides of the plus 15. I do find it can be a bit difficult to find a specific thing depending on what you're looking for but the home decor and cafe are great. I also like that they have a wide variety of mens and womens wear so you can find something for everyone. We stopped by to get hubs outfitted for a friends wedding in Mexico and were able to find everything we needed."}
{"text":"Well, I guess I had set myself for a higher expectation then what I saw!
This was touted to be a special Simons as its being housed in a Historical Building in Downtown Calgary, but once I entered you almost don't know that you are in an Historical Building, I would say The Hudson's Bay next door were able to keep the feel more then the Simons.
There are 4 floors altogether, the layout was nice but very cramped, doesn't give you the same airy feel as the locations in Edmonton, West Vancouver.
Well, I really like their effort to keep downtown vibrant, but I am not sure if they can recuperate the expense they have put in with the business they are currently doing!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on opening day.  We missed the morning festivities which was probably a good thing.  Considering there was still a lot of people well into the closing hours, it must have been a madhouse in the daytime.

Simons (or La Maison Simons) has been in business since 1840 originating from Quebec City.  Since then their move out west has seen them open up their largest store in Edmonton.  The West Edmonton Mall location has been a staple of mine since they opened in 2012.  Every time I go to Edmonton I have to stop in, even just to look at what's new.

Being a larger man of Asian origin there aren't many things that fit me here; however,  I can appreciate the styles and labels they carry.  I quite often come out of a Simons empty handed but still happy because I was able to get a good dose of ideas I can take with me.

Although not as big as the West Edmonton Mall location, the Calgary store boasts over 90,000 sq. ft. on four levels in the revitalized Lancaster Building.  The first two floors house women's fashions with part of the second floor dedicated to a cafe and home decor/accessories.  The cafe actually looked like they have decent food.  The third and fourth floors have men's clothing, with the top floor dedicated to suits and clothing of the formal variety.

It's interesting to see how they integrated the store so that it seamlessly transitions from the Lancaster Building to the Core Shopping Centre and as well as the adjoining plus 15.  It doesn't feel like a big department store but, more of an eclectic combination of smaller boutique shops.

I'd have to say Simons hits all the good notes except for one, I think some of the prices are a bit too high considering a lot of this stuff is manufactured in China.  Don't get me wrong, I think the store, it's employees and its merchandise is great; just that, I think a bit more diversified pricing on something other than printed tees are in order.

Welcome to Calgary!"}
{"text":"A beautiful five storey department store based in Quebec.  This is their second Alberta store (the other in West Edmonton Mall).  The space is absolutely beautiful, with unique design on each floor, and a large scale mural with touches of Canadiana by a local artist.  The store has all their unique brands Le31, Icone, and Twik, as well as designer brands.  They have a home section, accessories, shoes, and so much more for both men and women.   They have a wide price range so you can usually find something nice in your own budget.  I personally love the Twik line, as it is affordable and fashionable.   This store even has a cute caf√© and tons of little touches that make it an enjoyable way to spend some time downtown on the weekend.  I hope this store helps revitalize the Core and downtown, as it sure is a beautiful space."}
