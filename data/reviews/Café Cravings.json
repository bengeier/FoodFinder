{"text":"My first yelp review.  I have been a taker of yelp for far too long.  I have been meaning to give reviews for a while and today was finally the time to give my first review.  I have had a breakfast sandwhich here once before where my girl friend brought me a breakfast sandwich.  It was good everything you could want.  I feel like I could of made one just as good at my house but,  really it was good.  My gf told me she waited for 40 minutes for the sand which.     We waited 2 months to go back and the one morning we needed something to hold us over before the the tailgate began.  I called 40 minutes in advance to get my sand which.  When I arrived, there was a line of 5 people where it took me 15 minutes to finally get to the front.  When I said hi I called in an hour ago.  She explained that it would be another 15 minutes.  Save yourself the time.  Go to your local giant eagle grab bagels, eggs, sausage and be done in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This place was great.  I ordered the turkey club panini and it was an amazing sandwich.  They also make fresh fruit smoothies that my wife loved.  I would have given 5 stars but they were a bit slow- sandwiches took about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Not only the best coffee shop in mount Washington but the best in Pittsburgh.  The local coffee shop you see in the movies that you think doesn't really exist, well it does and this is it.   The coffee and food are both amazing with lower prices than starSucks. The owners and employees are incredibly friendly and will learn your name by the second visit.  If you like sports then talk to Keith because he's always up for a good discussion and his wife Vicki will talk about anything else that fits your fancy. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place.   I don't drink alcohol so I like to think of this as my version of the local bar where everyone knows my name."}
{"text":"I used to live on Mt. Washington and I miss Cafe Cravings so much.  I so miss not being able to walk there anymore.  Their drinks and food are awesome, just awesome.  My mom always gets a green tea latte and she said that theirs is way better than Starbucks.  And I need to mention Vicki and Keith, the owners.  I think those are the right names.  They are so unbelievably friendly and after just a few visits I would walk in and Vicki immediately knew my drink order.  And Keith is usually singing!  It just made me happy going in there!"}
{"text":"The only issue here is that you may have to wait a few minutes for your order. I love the turkey panini for lunch. For breakfast, their bacon egg and cheese is about as close to the real deal NYC sandwich as you'll get. Their coffee is great. If you want a specialty drink, try the Village Vanilla."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in Mount Washington by far!   Not only they are the best relative to the other establishments on the Mount, but they also have several characteristics that make this coffee shop great for itself:   - the friendliest and I mean FRIENDLIEST staff . You are greeted with a smile and always remembered. Consider it the Cheers of coffeeshops.  - Good food! And they have variety, from donuts to sandwiches and ice cream.  - Outdoor sitting in the weekends  - You can bring your dog in when you are ordering !!"}
{"text":"Abstract:  Great breakfast, okay coffee, awesome people.  Breakfast: +1.5 I go back for the bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel. They are hand made to order, and made well. With real eggs, kids. The pastries and donuts look really good, too. Psh, like I didn't get a donut. I always upvote donuts.   Coffee: +.5 Plainly said, the over-roasted coffee is nothing to write home about, but it's WAY better than anything else on the Mount. They offer perfectly drinkable, auto-drip coffee at fair prices.   Atmosphere: +2 It's casual, relaxed, and the perfect amount of kitschy. Here, you can add cream & sugar if you want without being judged. This is refreshing if you frequent swank pour-over bars... like the one in the strip that will remain unnamed... that used to be on 21st Street... They lectured my mom. I digress.  So... the breakfast sammies are sound and it's super chill, but I'm not crazy about the coffee. It sounds pretty average; why the fourth star?   The people make it. It's a great little neighborhood shop, and an asset to the area. Even an insufferable introvert like me can stop in and enjoy a chat with the über-friendly staff while I wait for my bacon to crisp on the flatiron."}
{"text":"Poor Service, long wait time, no internet, very limited seating. If you are not a local who knows the staff, I would not go to Cafe Cravings for coffee or breakfast. On my multiple trips for weekend breakfast (most recent being my last), my order was taken, and several people were served ahead of me. A wait time of 20 minutes for a bagel egg and cheese that bruggers manages to put together in less than 5 minutes is inexcusable and seems to be the status quo at this shop. The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is a decent attempt at hometown coffee shop, but if you are looking for good service, this is no place for an outsider."}
{"text":"I love this little shop and was sad when I moved away - just out of walking distance. I still make the trip though - the breakfast sandwiches and friendly service are worth it. They have a good selection of coffees and always give orange slices with your breakfast. Don't come here in a rush or you will miss out on the great atmosphere and neighborhood feel the owners have successfully created."}
{"text":"Love their cafe mochas. Hubby loves there turkey breakfast sandwiches.  You always get little orange slices with your food.  They have a decent selection of items to choose from.  A cute and cozy spot to stop at when in Mt Washington."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh and was looking for a cute, local place to stop for coffee and breakfast for my family of 6.  This place was perfect.  The food was good, perfectly priced and my children were welcome.  Highly recommend for a local, family friendly breakfast.  And the coffee was delicious!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet: It was a nice walk, but I'm assuming the other coffee shop in the area would have done about the same.   For the detail oriented yelpers: I'm all about local finds and loving every second of it! The one reason I gave Cafe Cravings a three is because they didn't serve my drink in a coffee mug, even after I mentioned I would like it for here. I think how you serve your coffee is just as important as the taste. I wanted to sit and relax the cup at the shop, I felt rushed or it was if they didn't want us to sit in the shop while we drank the coffee. Either way, that is the main reason they didn't receive the fourth star.   Other than the cup situation we enjoyed the experience! I ordered a fall spiced latte with almond milk. I'm not too hip on the sugary drinks but went along with it. As I watched the gal make the coffee she added a large scoop of something white, I'm assuming it was vanilla. That addition is what made the drink super sweet and delicious though! Just a warning, their sweet drinks are no joke! There were also people in and out the whole time we were there which was reassuring that it is a well supported business.   Next time: I'll probably save the time walking and grab coffee closer where we arrived after the incline"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of coffee and my double shot of espresso was finished in 2 minutes flat. The espresso itself was very nice, smooth and not much bitterness at all, which was surprising. The food selection looked dynamite and I watched someone scarf down a sandwich and it looked delicious. This place was buzzing with locals and very dog friendly."}
{"text":"Great coffee and teas, delicious sandwiches. The owner is a super nice guy, love having this little gem so close to home!"}
{"text":"My previous review mentioned a lack of Internet, but the last time I was there, I was able to log on via Xfinity ."}
{"text":"Café Cravings embodies what a community coffee shop should be. The owners are incredibly friendly and when you order a sandwich, it's packaged in a brown bag with orange slices or grapes (like your own mom packed it for school).   The ONLY reason I didn't give Café Cravings 5 stars is because I LOVE dark roast coffee and their espresso is pretty weak. But the experience of the café outweighs that, and the food is great for a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich. I hope this owner sees this and gets some bold dark roast beans!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot if you are looking for a quick not expensive local spot. Great coffees and sandwiches! Pleasant owner and service! When we are back in Pittsburgh we will sure stop in again!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this coffee shop.  The coffee, homemade breakfast sweets and homemade soups are all very good.  The owners are really, really nice!  I make it a point to meet a lot of my friends there and they love the place as well!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice quiet mom and pop place to grab a specialty coffee and a light breakfast to start your day.   It's in the middle of a nice and shaded part of mount Washington. It makes it nice to take a walk after eating.   The food menu is limited because it is so small which is holding back a little."}
{"text":"Very cozy, eccentric cafe. The paninis were pretty good and they had great options. It's a small space, but they make great use of it and there are places to sit inside and out. The women working behind the counter were sweet and welcoming."}
{"text":"Cafe Cravings is an awesome local gem. I've lived in the Duquesne Heights area of Mt. Washington for 6 years now and Cafe Cravings is one of my favorite parts of the neighborhood. I have been here more times than I can remember and have tried numerous sandwiches and drinks, and I can say that they are consistently good. I love that they have abundant specialty coffee drinks and non-caffeinated drinks that change with the seasons. My favorite for the winter is the Cinnamon Sticky Bun Latte. If you are someone who likes sweets, this latte is delicious! I get it with an extra shot of espresso for some more caffeine and to cut down on the super sweetness.  If you're there for breakfast, I really recommend ordering your sandwich on a bagel or croissant. That little detail makes the sandwich so much better! I always enjoy the turkey club for lunch. I love how they give you a side of fruit (usually oranges) with whatever you order!  One thing to note - if you are on any kind of a schedule, definitely call ahead if you remember. I have waited almost 40 minutes on some days, which is really crazy for a simple sandwich. However, I will continue to go back because I truly do love the food - you can tell it's prepared with care using quality ingredients. I also love that it's such a great local spot. It's a vital cornerstone of a thriving community!"}
{"text":"Local, friendly, and they have wonderful sandwiches, pastries and excellent coffee.   Tucked away near Chatham Village, this neighborhood gem caters to local residents and works hard to keep their business. There's a cool local vibe.  One of my favorite things is to sit outside on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Situated right near a cluster of hiking trails and a beautiful park, Cafe Cravings is a hidden gem; the lush, whimsical decor and ultra fun specialty drinks (try the Bananas Foster or Village Vanilla!)  make this tiny cafe an oasis to step into after a hearty nature excursion. I love the full wall adorned with an image of a forrest waterfall, the funky colorful chairs, and the small-town, mega local feel.  As a Mt Washington resident, I'm thrilled to have this spot so close-by!"}
{"text":"On our way to North Carolina from Buffalo we pulled off the main highway in a relentless driving rain into Pittsburgh for lunch. Not familiar with the city, our cellphone service was going in and out so we had to find somewhere quick that was dog friendly.  Luck was on our side when we stumbled upon Café Cravings. We both ordered sandwiches which hit the spot on a rainy day. My BLT was delicious, perfectly layered on fresh white lightly toasted bread. An old school fave with enough bacon to slip a few bites to my dog. Service was great and the girls even put out a small bowl of water for my happy pooch. Thanks to the staff that worked on June 23rd!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe.  Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town, and this popped up as a spot to grab a quick breakfast on our way to our next destination.  Easy to find parking out front, which was surprising for a Saturday at 9am.  I got a Pork Roll/Cheese/Egg sandwich on a bagel with a coffee.  Great price point, simple but delicious sandwich.  Most tables are 2-seaters with only one booth that could seat the three of us (though there were extra stools and chairs out that you could pull over).  I would certainly make it a point to come here on the regular if I was a local, and you can tell the folks that work there know their regulars.  The other patrons were all relaxed and joked with the staff.  Overall, happy we stopped here!"}
{"text":"This is neighborhood coffeeshop, and locally owned. We all know supporting locally owned business is a good thing. I like the fact that they carry boar's head lunch meats and cheeses for their deli sandwiches. They close early everyday, around five, and open early. Breakfast sandwiches all day long, great lattes, pumpkin spice, everything you like about the chain places and a nice atmosphere. Owners are friendly too. Stop in at 402 Bigham Street!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches and strong coffee. Throw in the friendly service and fun games and you don't need much more."}
{"text":"Friendly staff that really knew their regular customers. I was new and the lady working - who from what I could gather seemed to be the owner - was very welcoming and accommodating.   I wanted a green tea matcha and am particular about how I like them (I'm *that* person lol) and she was knowledgeable about the matcha ingredients. She let me look at the almond milk ingredients and gave me the option of blending the drink or just having it over ice. It was cool being in the creative process.   The availability of almond milk and pure green tea matcha were impressive. Only drawback is that the almond milk was vanilla and gave the matcha a funky taste, which the barista warned me might happen since I was deviating from the recipe. It tasted almost more vanilla than it did matcha, but I am a matcha fiend who prefers it with a teaspoon of plain almond milk.  They also have loyalty cards which you can take with you or you can leave in an alphabetized old-school card catalogue style box near the register. I took one. I would frequent it more if it had wifi as I primarily use cafés for work, but if you're in Mt. Washington and need a pitstop, this is worth it."}
{"text":"I love this cute cafe and I'm so happy it's in my neighborhood. I walk here often for breakfast and a caffeine fix. There are a lot of drink options. Whether you are looking for a basic cup o' joe or some frou-frou blended stuff, you can find it here.   The breakfast sandwiches are super yummy and made to order. If it's busy or if you're with a large group, sandwiches may take a while to appear, but you're not going to get a better breakfast sandwich for the price so just sit back and chat with the locals.   The coffee is decent. It's not the best in the city but it's definitely your best option in and near the Duquesne Heights area.   The owners are always so friendly and welcoming! It's truly a treat every time I visit."}
{"text":"Awesome local coffee shop. Everyone is super nice, and they allow me in with my weenie dogs if I'm stopping in on a walk. Good food too! Ive only ever tried their breakfast sandwiches, and they are your usual homemade egg/cheese/meat combos on your choice of bread/croissant/english muffin, and they come with a side of fruit, usually a half orange in slices. They close around 3 on the weekdays. Some mornings it can be a little busy in there with the regulars from Chatham Village, but I don't mind waiting and chatting it up. Its nice to have this right down the street from me, and Ill definitely miss it when I eventually leave the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Loved this Bigham find! Perfect if you are looking to grab a little breakfast or lunch and a coffee. We had the turkey/egg whites/provolone on wheat and were happy with it! Also had the banana nut chai. We stopped in on a Sunday around 11:30 and a line quickly formed after we had walked in. I think this is a regular stop for people who live in the area. Easy parking in front on the street. I would definitely pop in again if I'm on Mount Washington."}
{"text":"Cafe Cravings is Mt. Washington's little Gem. Really awesome staff and excellent roast beef paninis/ iced coffee/ breakfast sandwiches! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I wish so much that I could give this 5 stars!  I wish so much I could sit and work here for hours!  I wish so much... that they had internet!  That's the whomp, whomp moment right there...  The cafe is adorable, set inside the beautiful Chatham Village.  Chatham Village in Mt. W is like this little Victorian colony of townhouses that you would never imagine are hidden up there.  But they're there.  And the residents are lucky enough to enjoy this adorable little coffee house right next door.  But it's so much more than a coffee house.  They have a huge menu full of lunch offerings besides the drink menu.  The drink menu alone is impressive for a small, hidden cafe.  I ordered the roast beef panini with horsey sauce.  It was tasty and came with chips and a little bowl of oranges.  At $7, it was a steal!    Living up here I'd make this my go to meeting and work spot but it doesn't have wireless internet.  I hate to be a spoiled Millennials (okay, I'm barely that), but that's kinda annoying.  Maybe it's just that environment where it's not necessarily needed.  Don't know.  But I'll be back for a quick bite with friends fo sho!"}
