{"text":"World Famous Pizza is my home away from home. It's definitely the best pizza place you're gonna find in the area, and the prices are very affordable. The staff are friendly to everyone, and they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted, and don't even get me started on how amazing the garlic dip they have goes with their pizza. World Famous is a household name for my group of friends, and if you haven't tried it yet I'd highly recommend it. Support small business!"}
{"text":"When entering the pizza place, it felt clean and the menu was presented clearly. They also had flyers which had all the information about their deals. Flyers were plenty. What attracted me was their walk in special deal on their flyer. So when ordered that, they told me it will take 10-15 minutes. So i waited. After 20 minutes, they have not made my order. I see others walk in and quickly taking their orders and walking out and from the looks of it they might have forgotten my order. So i waited more and eventually the order was received. The end result after a long wait was actually not bad. I was hungry and felt comforted with their pizza. But felt a bit bummed out by the waiting time and their lack of acknowledgement of their customer's order."}
{"text":"I tried the panzerotti and oh man those were some fresh veggies and soft bread. For 4.99 definitely a great place to get a good meal"}
