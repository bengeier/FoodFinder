{"text":"For take out... it's not bad. There were horrible reviews on this but maybe it's because they didn't know what to order.   Tonight I ordered the Shanghai curry noodles and requested chicken only. Also ordered spicy squid and spicy tofu.   The vermicelli noodles was good. Nice balance of curry. Dry and loose the way I like it with a good portion of chicken. The tofu was crispy and almost over done. I prefer to have a bit more of that moist white tofu inside the crispy outer. The squid was executed really well. Tender and very flavourful. No heavy batter which was a nice surprise. A light dusting of what looks like rice flour and pan fried with chopped onions and chilli peppers. Really good...  Overall, for take out its good. Just be careful what you order. The typical Chinese dishes are gonna be, well, typical. There are tables and chairs for those who wish to \"dine in\", but really, this a quick take out place."}
{"text":"Was in the area running an errand and had that cruel \"I need carbs, fast\" feeling that everyone knows. I do not eat at usual corporate suspects for fast food so looked around and went this way.  Anyway, this thing looked good enough and so I went on in expecting hot woks, sweating friendly cooks and fresh ingredients with savory food. Well...uuh....no. It's more like a Chinese place with what I would call a \"Thai-Name-Upsell\". Or maybe the owner is one of the genuine Chinese-Thai folk. Who knows.  Why? Well the daily special amongst others was General Phao chicken, which I ordered. Was to come with free can of pop and a spring roll. Ok, before the review,  a little anecdote about General Phao. He was chief of police in Thailand in the mid 30s of the past century and known for his \"corruption and terror\". It escapes me why his name honors the menu of so many low-end take out places - are corrupt cops a good tasty thing? Be it as it may, I discovered some remarkable contradictions about the name and the dish:  Phao was rich - the dreadful sweet red sauce on the chicken wasn't. Phao was corrupt - well, charging 6.99 for crunchy deep-fried chicken lumps is a crime against reason. Phao was from Thailand - the dish obviously isn't, it's Chinese. Sort of. Phao killed many people - well, I just ate, so if I don't post again you'll know why.  The dish came with Chinese fried rice (rice, egg shreds, a few chunks of I don't know what and lots of sodium). And a spring-roll filled with leftovers from the day before or at least some kind of crude nonsense. Microwaved and super-heated, optimized for delivery I guess.  Service: I remarked that I wish to \"dine in\", 5 minutes later the bloke at the cash handed me a bag with my order. Hmmm. I thought I told him I was sitting down to eat. He blandly remarked \"no eat in\". Ahh. Ok, guess the three tables are only decoration.  I am giving this place two, not one star because it did fill me up (after eating only three bites) and secondly because I am the first person to review this place, so it's only fair to let others prove me wrong - - - if the hospital has WIFI."}
{"text":"This place should not be called Thai Delight. Out of four Thai dishes ordered from them last night, nothing resembled Thai food. It is just really bad, cornstarch-laden Chinese food. If that's what you feel like, go for it; but it sucks to think you're ordering Thai food, drop 40 bucks, and plates of shiny green peppers, onions and grey beef show up at your door. The pad thai was like eating sugar. Believe me, there are times when I don't mind and even crave shiny Chinese food.. but to call this Thai food is a gross misrepresentation."}
{"text":"This is a small \"hole in the wall\" restaurant. It looks dingy from the outside. And there arent usually very many people in the restaurant. But the food is amazing, the service is great, and the prices are fair. They had traditional Thai food and things I've never heard of. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Coming from a background of having Thai food in thailand I can honestly say it was some of the most horrible unauthentic Thai food I've ever had. Pad Thai is a hard thing to mess up but they did a pretty good job of making it taste like it came from a box. Never going back."}
{"text":"Yum!  I just discovered this place and its deeeelicious!  Very reasonably priced and big portions.  The menu is huge and has a great variety of different thai dishes.  Delivery is free for orders over $20 and they have awesome \"family dinner\" deals.  And to add a cherry on top the servers are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow. Worst pad Thai ever. I always say eat what ever the name on the restaurant says. So I had Thai.  This place is more of a Chinese place but I won't be eating here again I check it out.  Cheap prices, but that probably explains a lot.   Located in a corner plaza behind a 7/11."}
