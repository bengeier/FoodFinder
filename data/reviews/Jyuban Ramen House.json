{"text":"The best ramen for me so far. The broth is not strong in saltiness but still very tasty.  It took me a while before I figured out that the entrance is inside the building though."}
{"text":"2.5 is what I'm trying to give here.  So after seeing some of the reviews (at 24 reviews) they seemed like a decent place to try out.  I felt that I should give them a try.    After coming back from Japan, all ramen places have just been.. blah.  This one, ramen wise, I wasn't impressed.  There were 3 of us. Here's what we ordered:  -Yamisou tempura (a root vegetable that's on the specials menu) -Pork belly (small) -Soft bone pork (small) -the original ramen shiso -tonkatsu -katsu donburi with black curry  The Yamisou tempura was well fried, lightly tempura battered, and fresh.  It had a good crunch and we were given a choice to dip it in wasabi salt or tempura sauce. Either/or tasted good=)  The pork belly came with 4 pieces in the small order.  Absolutely terrific in texture and flavour.  It had a lot of fresh scallions on top and the fatty part was melt in your mouth, so we all rather enjoyed it.  The Pork soft bone came with 4 pieces as well in the small order.  It was nice.  Chewy and wasn't too dried.  It had fresh scallions and sesame seeds on top.  The only thing was, it tasted (flavour wise) exactly like pork belly.  So it became a little boring.   On to the ramen and rice...  My mum had ordered the original ramen with shiso soup.  She said it was too salty and apart from the salty, there wasn't much flavour at all.  She said her noodles themselves were not the best she's had and they were too soft in texture.  I had ordered the tonkatsu ramen.  I found that my soup base, was a tiny bit oily compared to what I'm used to.  There wasn't much flavour at all.  It was a really large portion, with 3 large pieces of pork.  The pork edges were nicely flavoured, but once again seem to taste like the pork belly and soft bone.  Some parts of the pork did have a that stinky pig smell/taste to it.  The noodle itself, although not yet soggy, it wasn't chewy/crunchy at all.  The noodles also didn't have that ramen tenacity.  I'm not sure if it was because it was over cooked.  We were there around 2pm.  My bf ordered the black curry.  The name is a little misleading, because there was no actual curry.  The sauces was a really dark sticky, sweet, spicy sauce.  It was thicker than terriyaki sauce and it tasted like sweet black vinegar.  If you're Chinese and you've had the pork leg and egg vinegar soup thing that women have after they give birth, it has that similar taste.  The katsu was crispy and well fried.  I personally didn't mind the sauce, but my bf found it too sweet.   Atmospher wise...  The restaurant is like your local noodle shop, it's nothing fancy and they purposely have \"customer\" comments/writings on the plastic wall.  It's cute and comfy.  The business cards are a smart design that holds your chopsticks.    The Service and the operations :  I believe it's a family owned business.  It seems the mom and dad works in the back, while the daughter was serving.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon.  They do open from 11-3 and then break in between before reopening at 6 for dinner.  I'm not sure if the dinner menu is different.   The mum was quick to service us when we arrived.  We took our own seats as there wasn't anyone around.  She came right over to give us menus.  I believe the daughter was in the washroom at the time.  Overall service was quick and informative.  They made sure to advise us that that black curry wasn't going to need 15 mins prep, and asked if that was ok.  They ensure the tea was always filled although there were only 2 tables including ours that day.  They did seem attentive to each table's needs.  Overall:  I found that the snacks were better than the noodles.  I would go back for the pork belly, to try the ox tongue, and maybe to try the dessert (since we were too full) but definitely not the ramen.  The portions seem good for the value.  Would I recommend it? Definitely to try the pork belly, other wise, not really."}
{"text":"I gave this place a re-visit after coming here for the first time 10 years. I remember it was one of the few ramen places uptown. This place hasn't changed much over the years, but unfortunately, I don't recall it being all that great the first time. The soup is overly oily, but somehow not very flavourful. And the pork belly in my pork belly ramen? All fat and skin.   The only memorable thing here was the Ox tongue. Really tender, well-marinated, and so thinly sliced, it almost melts in your mouth. As delicious as it was, the dollar-a-piece price tag is probably a bit too steep to convince me on a return visit to Jyuban."}
{"text":"one of the worst ramen i had in my entire life. i have no idea how this place is still open."}
{"text":"This was my first time to go to Jyuban Ramen House. I ate pork ramen with pork bone soup. So excellent and delicious meal! Pork bone soup was very great and i couldn't taste it in Toronto except here. I was so sensitive in MSG but i hadn't any side effect of MSG after finished the meal. Noodles are so fresh and porks are so tasty. No MSG is very important for everybody. i will come back soon and recommend to all of my friends to come Jyuban."}
{"text":"You know when you're craving something so badly, that you disregard what your fellow yelpers have to say and go try the play out anyways? I feel into that trap and it left me feeling unsatisfied.  Was craving ramen last weekend and decided to try this play out anyways because I figured why not. The empty restaurant could have been my cue to steer clear.. Overall it's pricey for what you get, did not taste like anything, the meat was just a giant slice that was hard to manage and I'm pretty sure the noodles aren't the right type of noodles (they kind of look like spaghetti).  If you're looking for some authentic ramen, sadly this place won't have what you're looking for."}
{"text":"First visit tonight and it was great!  Had the ox tongue, pork belly side dishes to start - they were rich and delicious!  Had two ramen dishes, both pork, one level 1 spicy, the other level 2. The pork was amazing, and so well prepared and the broth was so flavourful! People who say otherwise are probably use to heavy MSG and chilli oil over everything.   But, it was the noodles that will get me coming back! These handmade noodles were so fresh and that everything was all natural was just added bonus."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked by some of the reviews. I really enjoy eating at this place. The ramen is delicious and in particular, the pork belly is melt in your mouth yummy. The broth is great too! I like the purity of this place in that no MSG or other chemicals are used. You don't feel thirsty after eating their ramen like you do in other ramen places.  The staff there are nice although really it's the same two people every time I go (the cook and the server.) The server is very friendly and polite. The food comes in a timely manner (although probably because it's never packed when I go.)   My boyfriend is a picky eater and he loves the place too. We often take friends here when we want them to eat good food and most of them love it."}
{"text":"Gee Wally, why is ramen so different from restaurant to restaurant.  Seems like everyone has their own variation of ramen.  I've had many versions of ramen at various restaurants in the GTA.  Some are similar to  instant noodles and more commonly have the shape and texture of spaghettini.    I came to this place, as my previous memory of the restaurant this replaces, had a nice chewy textured noodle in a mild tasteful broth.  I ordered the beef shank noodle soup.  The beef was sparse and soup was void of any flavor....but it was quite spicy.  To my dismay, the noodles were of the spaghettini variety.  The texture was soft and not the chewy ramen I was hoping for.  Good news...the noodles were plentiful.  Unfortunately this place did not satisfy my craving for Ramen.  Still in search of a good bowl of ramen....The Ramen is out there."}
{"text":"Worst ramen in GTA easily.  I use to go to the ramen store that was located at the same location, it was decent, but closed down. So we decided to try out the new store.  I did not expect amazing ramen, but I can make better ramen than this place at home.  It is ridiculous that they dare to charge 9 bucks for tasteless soup, bad noodles with extremely salty and dry pork.   Did I mention they put beans and bok choy in your ramen? What the ****?"}
{"text":"The pork belly here is the best I've ever had Very delicious and healthy because there is no msg!"}
{"text":"Jyuban is run by a very hard-working, local couple where everything is made in-house and perfectly fresh. I have been there since their opening, and they have since expanded their menu to include a greater variety of offerings and larger portions.   I highly recommend their special tonkatsu ramen (#16 on the menu), which includes a heaping portion of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly and several large slices of roast pork. You can tell just by tasting how much time it must have taken to make the pork belly so tender, rich, and flavorful. I also love that they are generous with their portions as well as their service. I rarely find myself satisfied with one bowl of ramen when I go out at other restaurants (which is understandable, because I eat A LOT), but I never feel hungry afterwards when I visit Jyuban. Another great item on their menu is their 'fried' ice cream, which is really two large scoops of ice cream covered in crushed corn flakes, Pocky sticks, and a drizzle chocolate sauce. It's a simple dessert, but the cornflakes give the ice cream a texture that will have you eating continuously from start to finish without setting your spoon down once.   A major selling point of their ramen is that it is completely free of MSG, which means you don't leave feeling like you have to consume a gallon of water afterwards. And it means the broth actually tastes like broth, completely natural and home-made from scratch. It has none of that powdery aftertaste you get in most other ramen restaurants that try to compensate for a lack of base flavor with a ton of MSG. While the space itself is pretty small and humble, you can tell just from the details that the owners really appreciate their business, and they've put a lot of heart into it. Their walls are covered not only in rave reviews they've gotten in the newspapers, but they've had customers leave their remarks and doodles as well.  Jyuban might not have the hype that comes with all the restaurants that have cropped up with the recent ramen craze, but it is an honest business that consistently serves an honest, quality product. Highly recommended if you're ever in the area and you're in the mood for a hearty bowl of noodles!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here. I ordered the pork bone soup broth ramen with pork and hubby ordered a donburi. My ramen was delicious - not overly salty - was flavourful and \"clean\" (no msg). The portion was also very generous. Hubby's donburi portion was pretty huge. FYI they don't have takeout containers. Not sure why there are so many bad reviews - maybe the broth wasn't salty enough for them...or perhaps they weren't used to the handmade noodles texture. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for fresh preservative free ramen."}
{"text":"** Please make sure you check out the filtered reviews about Jyuban Raman House!!  Overview: Owner and chef is Chinese, BUT he trained under a Japanese Ramen master. I've been to the Big 3 downtown (Sansotei, Santouka, Kinton) but NONE of them make their pork belly or eggs like Jyuban. Jyuban broth is clearer and simmered for hours (NO POWDER), and ramen is not packaged.  Location: Tucked inside the Commerce Gate plaza, Jyuban has a lot of competition with the nearby Korean Grill, Hot Pot, and various other BBT joints. Parking is ALWAYS an issue at this plaza. I opt for underground and back parking if I can't find something right away. Access to this restaurant is via inside the little mall only.  Facility: Slightly out of date and kind of kitschy, there is marker writing on the wall (I'm fairly those are intentional), which offer a cozy feeling. Ceilings are high though, so everything you say, every time your chair moves, it echoes. Washrooms are not the best, typical of a lower quality asian restaurant. This place needs to update their decor. There is a random giant fish tank as soon as you walk in. It serves ZERO purpose, it looks hideous... there are fake fish suspended inside.  Food Quality & Price: What completely makes up for their decor, is the quality of their ramen. Reviews of Jyuban complain about the food quality, but in my opinion those people have no idea what good ramen is supposed to be like in the first place. People are so accustomed to eating fake, powdered, instant ramen with heaps and heaps of toppings, MSG and preservatives, they forget (and are completely ignorant to) what quality ramen should look and taste like.   Jyuban's ramen sifu (master) has trained for years under his own Japanese ramen master and refuses to ever put MSG in his dishes. The result is a light and clean tasting broth (what you REALLY want for your ramen). For those with a more sensitive palette, you can taste that the pork bone soup is real (not made from powder) and has been simmering for hours. Ramen is freshly made IN HOUSE by the ramen master.   Noodles come in three types, your usual egg noodle, spinach noodle (green) and squid-ink noodle (black). For those who are used to having other ramen houses, stick to the egg noodles until you feel that your tongue is sensitive enough to takes the undertones of the other two noodles. They are VERY subtle and may not make a big difference to you (but they cost extra). Spicy ramen is VERY spicy for the typical patron. Order a Level 1, that is usually more than enough for most people. I order Level 2 and I am comfortable, but I am a spice fiend, so do not use me as a spice gauge. My entire family has their nose running, brows sweating and eyes watering at Level 1. Egg is marinated cooked to perfection - solid but slightly yolky (not your simple white boiled egg as seen in other ramen houses). The only catch is that the beef is hit-n-miss, BUT the pork belly is to die for! Anything with pork belly will not let you down!!  Ramen dishes here are slightly pricier than the average, but understandable if you can appreciate the purity of the craft. All this said, I do not really like the appetizers. Desert is also okay. If you come to Jyuban, you come for the ramen.  Service: There is always one woman there (owner's wife, I believe) when we go and she always recognizes us and knows what we order. She is attentive and efficient. They had recently hired a young girl to help with service. She is okay. I don't like the new rewards card - it used to be one bowl = one stamp, then 10 stamps get you 3 free bowls (that was great). Now it's every $10 spent = 1 stamp, then 6 stamps gets you 10% off (terrible deal, might as well not have this at all).  Overall: Jyuban is a quiet restaurant and I am glad that the owner/cook does not compromise his authenticity despite some poor reviews. People really do not know what good quality ramen looks or tastes like. He is not Japanese but his master is, so in my opinion, the ramen is authentic. Points to improve on - their location needs to update their decor and ambiance, take a look at the quality of their appetizers, get rid of/get better rewards program, and increase the portion of their ramen by just a little. Jyuban scores a 4.5/5 overall rounded up to 5 to balance out the incredibly poor reviews people have previously written."}
{"text":"Satisfied that craving for a deliciously flavorful, warm and authentic ramen. Our palates are bombarded daily with so many artificial preservatives, sugars and salt that I truly appreciate Jyuban for creating such a depth of flavor without msg or excessive salt! Handmade noodles, generous portions, years of dedication and a passion for their craft are some of the reasons I admire the ramen chef and his staff here. Thank you for sticking to your beliefs that food should be tasty and healthy!"}
{"text":"absolutely not authentic! and for the prices, definitely not worth it. Kenzo is way better. The chinese menu and place being practically empty  while the surrounding shops all had long waiting lines had given me the feeling that this ramen experience wouldn't be that great. I was spot on.  the menu is pretty expensive. The cheapest item you can get is a $5+ vegetable tempura appetizer. I got the tonkotsu ramen which is my go to ramen especially trying to assess the place, especially since it is so hard to make . It was so bland and the noodles weren't right. ugh.  For the prices, and quality, every other ramen place I've been in so far has been better."}
{"text":"I have been to jyuban twice now. The first time was when they just opened, so I can't really be to critical of them. However the second time I went everything was exactly the same. Everything is bland and tasteless. It literally taste like noodles in hot water. There is no taste to their ramen or broth, maybe they are trying to pursue some form of healthy alternative ramen, fine. But a little bit of salt wouldn't hurt.  1 star for the operation and establishing a business, because that is not easy 1 star for a pretty menu with a whole bunch of Japanese on their making me feel like I was really in for a treat"}
{"text":"I don't give out 1 stars cause it would have to be really really bad on all counts, across the board.   I came here one night with my boyfriend after the reviews on Yelp seemed to be okay and we were both craving ramen.  They advertise they don't use any MSG. I don't doubt that. The soup had no flavour. The noodles weren't memorable.   If you like tasteless broth with no MSG, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I was kind of craving for Wonton noodles, but unfortunately, my favorite noodle place was closed for Wednesday.  I am too lazy to drive to another wonton noodle place so i decided to try Jyuban.  It was a pretty chill place with some old Japanese song playing in the background.  The place was extremely clean as how it always is in a Japanese noodle place.  I decided to try to spicy bbq pork noodle.  The waitress was really friendly and advised me to just try the first level of spiciness as there are three levels.    I waited for more than 20 minutes for my noodles when only seven other people in the restaurant.  I thought the wait was a little bit too long, but I can definitely live with that.  along came, my bbq pork ramen noodle with pork bone soup I think.  I thought the soup was a little blant and the thickness of the noodle is a little thicker than I liked.  However, I really like the fact that they don't place msg in the soup place.  She kind of gave me the salt a little too late as I was half way thru my noodle already.  I guess it is something new I learned eating at a no msg and low sodium place.  I have a asked for the salt.  It happened to me last time when i was eating at a really high class restaurant.  I thought all their food were under salted.  Might be the trend of healthy diet i guess.    But man, was the ramen spicy, but it is a weird kind of spiciness where it only hit the back of my throat.  This is not the kind of spiciness I enjoyed.  Oh well, the cha siu (bbq prok) was large in portions.  There were three HUGE pieces, and I really like that.  The soup base was a little thin though.  Overall, the ramen was pretty good with good customer service.  I would come back again, maybe try their rice dishes since I don't likr their hand made ramen that much.  I forgot to mention that the hotspring egg was absolutely delicious.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a ramen place for everyone. We are so used to the normal MSG filled ramen that our taste buds need so much flavor and salt. However, this place has a more subtle (but still, nevertheless, delicious) tasting broth which is so refreshing.   I had a seafood ramen, they definitely very generous with the seafood and ingredients. My boyfriend had the spicy pork bone broth and you can taste different layers, first, the pork bone, and then the spicyness.  The noodles are handmade daily, so its definitely fresh. The ramen master also keeps away from preservatives when making the noodles. always a plus.  Definitely the most delicious bowl of healthy ramen I've ever had. I absolutely respect the owners for going against what is \"regular\"(msg filled, preservative filled) and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered this ramen restaurant in the GTA, its been my favorite one whenever I crave for ramen.  I have been going there regularly and I love their 'Soft Pork Bone Ramen' its delicious.  Most of the ramen is priced around a very affordable price of $7-10.   There is one bowl of ramen called the 'Superbowl Ramen' that is $15 but that one is really special. There are 3 types of ramen inside. The squid ink noodles (which has good health benefits), spinach green noodles, and egg noodles.   Also love the bbq ox tongue a lot and their crispy ice cream for dessert (its like icecream with corn flakes) really great to finish the meal!!  My favorite part of this ramen house is that they use all Natural Ingredients to make their ramen, they also DON'T use msg, which is great. Their soup is all made from scratch and takes hours before they can use it.   Quality is what you are paying for here in this ramen shop compared to any others in the GTA. For me, I would much much rather eat healthier made food then putting msgs and chemicals in my body. You know what they say, 'you pay for what you get'.  Highly recommended, you will find yourself coming back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Went to eat with a friend. I guess the food wasn't intriguing enough, I put down my chopsticks for a good 5-10 minutes to continue talking with my friend. The noodles and everything was just good. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"No MSG? I'm in. When I do eat ramen, I often leave the restaurant feeling thirsty and unhealthy. However, this place offers a quite unique and enjoyable experience! You will be greeted by a friendly and polite middle-aged women, who ensures your cup is never empty without green tea. While you wait for your food, the wall illustrations drawn by its customers will keep you entertained. The food is prepared with care as it is aesthetically pleasing and flavourful.  Sliced Pork Ramen with Level Two Spicy ($7.99):  When my bowl of noodles arrived, I was in shock because the broth looked clear and milky. I immediately asked the waitress whether the chef forgot to add hot spices to my bowl. She reassured me that I will taste the spiciness as soon as I take my first bite of noodles. Wow, she sure did keep her promise! I felt a numbing sensation after a few seconds. It was a feeling that I have never encountered before. The meltingly-tender slices of meat, the perfectly marinated soft inner egg yolk and the handmade bouncy noodles were greatly satisfying as a whole. In addition, it was topped with perfectly steamed enoki mushrooms and sweet corn, as well as large pieces of dried seaweed.  Tip: I would not recommend trying Level Three Spicy because it might numb you to the point where you would not be able to appreciate the other ingredients in the bowl.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone that self proclaims as a ramen lover."}
{"text":"i went here today at around lunchtime. i have been wanting to try this place for like a few months now and i finally got to and i must say i was rather disappointed.   first, i ordered a spicy miso pork bone soup ramen with cha siu (note: they had three levels of spicy; i chose level 2 and honestly it was like nothing) this ramen wasn't bad. it's alright. at first, the taste to me was quite good, but after a while i just got tired of it. im not a fan of the kind of ramen they used (it's like textured-spaghetti noodles which i dislike), their egg was kinda weird and yeah. the only good thing was that they have a generous amount of cha siu (good for the meat eaters out there; just not for me xD) oh and they don't have msg   i decided to order dessert and got the \"ice&fire (i think that's literally what it's called) BAD IDEA. it was $5.99 and all it was, was fried sesame paste balls (like tong yuan) and frozen grapes...LIKE FORREAL?! the flavours don't even work. it was just a complete waste of money and eating effort. ( but seriously frozen grapes you kidding me ? for $5.99 ?! you?! kidding ?! meeeEE?!) also the server constantly told me that it's very cold for the ice one (hell yeah it is considering it's like straight from the freezer) and that it's very hot for the fire one ( hell no it isn't it's like warm)  so yeah, food was not the best. decorations were okay. (the place looked rather idk bad idk like something about it gave off this kind of weird feeling tbh it kinda ugly but hey some people got to write on their windows and walls) my unfortunate ass didn't get to :( :( umm and their server was pretty nice. constantly asked us about our food and how'd we think of it"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cozy, small, good location by commerce gate; service was great, very friendly   Food: \"absolutely amazing pork belly rice\" 3.5/5 - it was amazing, but not \"absolutely\" amazing, the pork belly was tender and flavourful. definitely a try if you visit  Overall: probably wont be back, since their menu doesnt really appeal to me much."}
{"text":"The Ramen here isn't mind blowing spectacular. You aren't gonna get a Foodgasm and wet urself just walking in the front door. This shit won't make you ascend to a higher plane. But they are generous with their chashu portions and their hand pulled noodles are some of the best I had. Nice and springy to the bite with a good chewy texture. Definitely worth a try. Anything porkbone is blessed.   I have to call out anyone who claims there is no flavour to the broth. The fact is your buds are permafried from all the msg you consume. As such it's not fair oh this broth has no taste. There is a very robust and deep flavour to the soup...the problem is your used to saltier things. I get why you had that experience just give it a fair chance.    The donburi is subpar and not worth your money.   FOR THE LOVE OF THE GREAT *insert figure here*  DO NOT TOUCH THE WASABI BASE RAMEN...that is all   Worth a try...just don't touch anything but the ramen"}
{"text":"Disappointed at the squid ink ramen, $4 extra & soup base is watery.  Go for pork ramen instead!"}
{"text":"It is definitely not worth listening to (another) hype from people who just love eating Japanese food, authentic or not!  Their ramen will not survive if they were to be sold in Japan.    Only here in Toronto that we are forced to accustom our taste with inferior cooking-quality of \"imported\" cuisine.  Anyhow, don't be fooled by their desserts (as I was, last night).  Their fire&ice $6.99 dessert which consisted of 5 frozen grapes & 5 lukewarm (from microwave) sesame mochi balls---- were a joke!   The wait was 15 minutes...just to give the customer the impression that it will be freshly done or too complicated to make!  That was a waste of my $7!  Their ramen & donburi were bland.    Well, if you have nothing to eat at home, then have your ramen somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hours on a weekday. Most restaurants around were packed but this one was completely empty. Ordered #40 on the menu which had pork cooked 3 ways. It was $15.25 but I had to try it anyway. (To Jennifer K's question: who would pay $15 for a bowl of ramen? - I did...but I do it because I am searching of a ramen place closer to home which can match the quality of pork found at Hokkaido Ramen Santouka).   The bowl of ramen was good. I did not get super thirsty after finishing my bowl so I'm sure its just like advertised.....NO MSG. The broth and pork had a soy sauce taste to it. Noodles were done well and good bite to it. Portion of meat was huge and for this bowl of ramen since it had 3 different kinds of pork. There was more meat than noodles so for you meat lovers out there this is the bowl for you. The quality of the meat was good but no where near Hokkaido Ramen. Loved the poached egg which came with the ramen. I only wish I could poach my eggs this good."}
{"text":"This place isn't that bad - at least as bad as I thought it was back when it first opening. But what is different about this place from other ramen places is that they have the squid ink and spinach noodles on offer as well.   Supposedly they are no additives, preservatives and MSG-free - which might account for some depth in the broth.   The chopstick holder is a stamp card-which gives you a free app. As specified on the caed - If you spend x amount each visit.   Overall the place wasn't as bad as I initially thought during my first visit - although I thought that the BFs tonkatsu ramen was better that my plain spinach one. The noodles themselves were a nice chewy texture - only thing is next time I will go for the egg ramen - as the spinach was good, but not really worth the two dollar upgrade charge."}
{"text":"Had Tonkatsu Ramen here last night and it was quite nice!  Broth was not very salty which I thought was quite nice as most places are MSG loaded to the max!  With this I ordered a rice ball to start and found it a bit salty!  In all I'll come back and try some other ramen!  The nice thing about Ramen is each place does it differently!"}
{"text":"Apparently this place is run by Chinese people and I think I could taste it. The ramen doesn't... really taste like ramen. The broth doesn't have that creaminess. The noodles I had in what I ordered (#38 I think?) were thicker Chinese noodles, not frizzy narrow ramen noodles.  To me it tasted like Chinese noodle soup - which is really mild tasting compared to Japanese ramen - with a LOT of meat in it. That's a segue into what's good about this place: you get *tons* of meat in your bowl and the meat is really tasty. A friend had a charred up piece of pork (not like standard cha siu in a ramen place - this was like a blackened brick of meat) and it tasted really good. It's like you get a variety of strong tasting meat, with the broth and noodles just there for the hell of it.  Also, the menu has like.. 60+ different ramen choices on it. It's mostly different meat combinations IIRC.  Giving this place three stars since I found the noodles and broth boring. If I was more of a meat lover (and I thought I was -_-) I'd be super in love with this place."}
{"text":"Great tasting natural ramen!  They use unbleached flour and no MSG!  Good for those wishing to stay healthy, bad for those hoping to get cancer or diabetes in their lifetime.  The prices for the items in the menu are reasonable and there is a great variety to choose from.  I am looking forward to trying their Tonkotsu Ramen, the Black Curry Tonkatsu, or the famously referred to Black Squid Ink noodle one.  I opted for their lunch specials because they were beautifully priced at something like $7.  Most other ramen shops seem to charge around the same price (or more if you value Japanese fingers kneading the noodles).  Plus other places seem to heavily rely on MSG to deliver that beloved kick to their dishes that people seem to get addicted to.  I know that MSG is not a good long term thing to consume, so I am delighted to have found this place and will be a regular customer.   I highly recommend you give this place a try too if you value the natural skill of a chef to provide a meal free of MSG and alloxans."}
{"text":"Too many ramen restaurants out there and why made this five stars? Well I would say because of \"simple\". Ramen looks very easy to make and that's the reason there are so many ramen restaurant out there. However how many ramen restaurant hand made their own noodle? How many of them use lots of pork and pork bones to prepare their broth? I doubt...  Only freshly hand made daily will result such chewy bouncy noodles, for sure deserve one star.   Pork broth that you can taste different layers of favor(if you taste carefully, you can taste the spicy, the meat and the bone layer after layer) instead of mixed all up with msg like other restaurant, for sure deserve another star.  The pork (cha siu) is so tender but not over stew that too soft without the chewy. Also the cha siu itself is so favourable with the marinade but won't cover up the pork favour, for sure deserve the 3rd star.  The chef and waitress are so friendly and patience to explain their menu and how they make it, for sure deserve 4th star.  For the above 4stars and only cost you $11 for a bowl of ramen and they even offer the stamps collecting discount system. That deserve FIVE STAR.  Thank you chef to make a \"simple\" bowl of noodle in soup so not \"simple\"."}
{"text":"Came here when it was first opened and didn't have the best experience. Ordered one of their ramen specialities, however, they gave me something I had not ordered and even told me I was wrong! I was taken a back and thought it was very unprofessional. Ramen was so-so given the prices, I would rather head downtown for better service and quality for relatively the same prices!"}
{"text":"Soup base and noodles on the bland side but the meat and toppings were pretty good."}
{"text":"My friend promised two expats back in town (including myself) that there is an amazing ramen joint in Richmond Hill. Having grown up on the East End, I was unfazed as I know anything can happen in asiatown, but my west end counterpart was entirely in disbelief since we all know the good stuff is only downtown.   \"Is it run by real Japanese?\" I had asked \"Chinese - which is why this place is amazing!\" said my friend. Knowing that he travels to Japan all the time for work, we gave him some extra credibility.  To be fair, this place is run by people from Hong Kong, not from China.  After we sat down,my friend says that the menu has expanded significantly, but went straight for the super ramen for $15 that he always gets anyway. My sauga counter part ordered a ramen with beef and cha siu, and i went for the cheap one that just had chasiu in tonkatsu soup base and some jyuban secret sauce. To be honest, I wasn't crazy about the flavour of my secret sauce, but you can tell the tonkatsu soup base was the real thing - thick and full of flavour. And then there's the meat. The meat for the ramen was done more than right. The cha siu was tender and smoky and the pork soft bone was saucy, slightly sweet and melted in your mouth.  Service is great, and they give loyalty cards. They advocate that they dont add MSG or other preservatives/additives. A little on the pricey side, but I would definitely come back and try a couple of other items."}
{"text":"Jyuban Ramen House has a limited menu offering Ramens, grilled dishes, rice dishes...   I was in shock when I noticed they have this Super-Bowl Ramen for $15!!! $15?!! Did I come to one of those Ramen place in NYC by mistakes??   No way, I going to pay that much for a Ramen in Toronto, Richmond Hill at a FTR places! :P So I settle for the cheapest Ramen which is NOT even on the Menu!   Jyuban Ramen ($5.95)  - Ramen in chicken soy sauce with pork and some veggie  - The waitress comment that it will be smaller than their regular Ramen but I told her is the perfect size for me  - The broth I tasted more soy than the chicken..and I expect it to be saltiness and it is really salty...  - 2 little piece of cold pork floating in my little Ramen...  - the noodle itself, was cooked al dente.. though quite good..( in their menu, they emphasis how good their in house made noodles are!!)   Rice cake with Pork ($2.50 if order alone with a noodle is $1.50)  - I will be really upset if I pay $2.50 for that! even at $1.50 really not worth it!!  - The pork inside was really really dry.. at first I thought it was those preserved shredded dried pork they sold in the supermarket..  - The rice has no taste at all... and the pork not juicy.. so SKIP!!!!   Chinese run Ramen joint... don't be tricked by the Japanese in the menu... and $15 for a Ramen?? Who is going to pay that much for one?"}
{"text":"Tried level 3 spicy here. Ramen is so yummy especially the soup and the medium egg. A big bowl of ramen is around 10 bucks"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best MSG-free ramen shops I've ever gone to. Shame that it closed."}
{"text":"Can't say it's my favourite ramen place. That title is still with someone else. However this place isn't so bad.   I discovered this place when I was searching for no MSG and this place basically announced it loudly. So I was curious to try it when I got the chance.   So far I only tried the tonkotsu ramen two variants of it. The secret sauce and the soy sauce versions. They're both good and they had ample chunks of meat. They have some brown coloured eggs which also add a bit of flavour.  The soy sauce one adds a bit more saltiness as expected. The flavour is not as strong.   The one thing I didn't like is there is no refill on the yummy noodles. So it's not the place to go if you want to do cheap carbo load.   Though if you are not a heavy eater it's good enough.   I may update my review once I find the ramen I like here. There are still other ramen I would like to try.  Since this place does not do any MSG I will try to visit more often and hopefully when I find the food that satiates my palate I will be able to give this place five stars. However, based on what I have eaten so far it's still a bit lacking. Please feel free to give me suggestions my next target is their butter ramen."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice and can tell she was passionate about the food there. She highly recommended the pork belly snack and repeated said its their best. She was definitely right, the pork belly was extreme delicious. Ordered a pork belly ramen and the snack, was not wrong to get it twice. Only mistake was ordering the small. The cha siu is by far the best, compared to other ramen places. The soft boiled egg was really well done, the yolk was soft and sweet but not runny.  The disappointing thing was the noodle and the soup. The noodle resembled Chinese egg noodle, it was nothing like ramen. Probably the worse ramen tried to date. The soup was nothing special and combined with the noodles, it seemed like something that is served at a Chinese cafe.  Overall, maybe come back and try a donburi with a pork belly snack dish. Will definitely get a large next time, double the number of pieces."}
