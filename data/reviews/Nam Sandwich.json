{"text":"I like it a lot.  Very nice staff. Cool decor.  Feels more authentic than the alternatives.  Better priced I think than most specialty sandwich places.   One of my fav places in that area. Sometimes I get it after going to Parlour.  It's nice.   I like the Chicken and the Beef Banh Mi Sanwiches.  The name reminds me of old those old shows/ movies that had American soldiers  talking about their time in \"Nam\" and that kind of saddens me.   I try not to eat bread and soy, but... sometimes I need a goddamn sandwich.   But that is neither here nor there.   I like to Nosh on Nam. Perhaps Vietnamese folk call it \"Nam\" also.  Rating: 4.5 stars, I'll round up."}
{"text":"Nice fresh rolls, and the horseradish sauce with the yam fries was definitely a highlight."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi, grilled chicken steamed bao and the sweet potato fries with curry sauce. The banh mi was really good and tasty. Baguette was skinny and fluffy (didn't hurt the roof of your mouth). Great sandwich. The steamed bao I ordered for my toddler was ok.. Really simple. chicken, some sauce sauce and cucumber slices. I would order the banh mi instead for my son next time. Sweet potato fries with curry sauce was surprisingly a tasty combination."}
{"text":"The lemongrass chicken banh mi was delicious with a decent helping of chicken. Service was very friendly. I'll eat there again because it was tasty; fresh and a good deal for the area; better quality than my usual at Spadina/Dundas. (But skip the drink, $2 for a can of pop is a little high.)"}
{"text":"Took a chance and stopped in today... as someone that has given up gluten I knew that I was having to cheat... it was worth it!  Got the pulled pork sandwich to go, and had to pull over to eat every last bite.  Was definitely worth it!  absolutely delicious!  As I was taking the sandwich, the girl at the counter said that she \"liked my smile\" too.  great experience and customer service... will be back to cheat on gluten again!   Well done Nam!"}
{"text":"Love their Coconut Meatball sandwich.  I'm actually addicted to it and if I don't get it once a week I go through withdrawals.  Bought several for a family get together over Christmas and the reviews were all very good.  I really need to try something else on their menu in 2016.  Think I will try the Lemongrass Grilled Chicken next time..."}
{"text":"Vietnamese sammies. This place is pretty basic, but it does what it does beautifully. Of particular interest are the pulled pork, and the tiger shrimp sandwiches. Fantastic! Their little Bao Steam buns... Yum! The only thing I didn't much care for was the pork belly. Bit too fatty for me. But everything else I've had here was top notch for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick take-out sandwich.  The staff are super friendly and very sweet.  I got the lemongrass chicken banh mi, which was really, really delicious.  Totally hit the spot.  Honestly, considering it's about the length of a subway footlong, the $6 price isn't bad at all.  The store was clean and well-kept.  Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"I've been a dozen times and its my go-to for a quick bite near Bellwoods. My faves are the Pork Belly, Fish and Chicken Banh Mi's.  On par with Banh Mi Boys without the crowds."}
{"text":"$6 for a Vietnamese style sandwich is a bit steep but still pretty good. The people who work there are so sweet. I would definitely go back if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Tried out Nam Sandwich shop after some good reviews on here. The reviews are all accurate to my experience as well. The Sandwiches are tasty, I had the recommended Lemongrass Chicken Bahn mi. I wouldn't say it compares quite to Bahn Mi Boys, but for being on the slightly west side of town, it's a great lunch option. Aside from the sandwich I had the yam fries which were delicious, well cooked and come with a choice of curry sauce or horseradish sauce. I had the curry sauce and it was the perfect accompaniment. Overall good experience, the prices aren't too expensive, the staff are very friendly and the vibe of the shop is great. So if you're in the neighbourhood, go check it out."}
{"text":"Service can sometimes be slow at lunchtime (but I mean where isnt it) so arrive early if you can. Its Bao's are my personal favourite, theyre so good! Clouds of yummy pork belly!"}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork sandwhich. The flavour of the pork was good, ingredients were fresh. I liked how there was coleslaw inside which was coated in a nice dressing that went well with the pork. I think what sets this place apart from other places I've tried like Banh Mi Boys is the bun. Like someone else stated in one of the reviews, the bun is skinny and fluffy. It wasn't too \"bread-y\", it was very fresh, a bit of a crunch on the outside and light on the inside, not overpowering or dominating the flavours inside. The people working there were also very nice."}
{"text":"I never expect much from banh mi stores that aren't Nguyen Huong. I grew up on those and those are still the cheapest and most legit banh mi's I've had. When people say Banh Mi Boys and other places like it are cheap, I do an internal eye-roll. They're tasty, but they aren't $3-$4. I still go though.  My friend and I did a Queen West food crawl the other day. My job is to find all the spots to go to. This means a lot of Yelp research, most of the time. I stumbled upon Nam. It's rather affordable. Not super cheap, but definitely wallet-friendly. I put it on the list just in case we wanted to go. I've done a thing before where I load up on sweet places and not enough savory places because sweets are usually smaller and more affordable. This time, I tried to be careful, so Nam became one of our savory spots.   My friend and I ordered a lavong banh mi ($7) - baked tumeric catfish, sauteed scallion, dill) and a grilled beef steamed bao ($4). I didn't have the bao, but I heard it was good. The banh mi was tasty too. Mild, but tasty. The catfish was juicy, the dill was definitely there, and the scallion added a nice refreshing bite. My friend said it was even better with sriracha, but sriracha isn't my kind of hot sauce, for the most part. What I really liked was that their buns are long, rather than fat, which means more crusty exterior, and less fluffy interior. It does have the downside of being unable to contain as much filling though.   After our crawl ended, I was trying to figure out my dinner plans before an event I was attending nearby, so I ended up coming again. Yeah. Twice in one day. I got the coconut meatball banh mi ($5.50). The meatballs were juicy and delicious. I actually liked it more than the lavong, although both were good.   When I crave banh mi, I'm still going to go to Nguyen Huong, but if I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind stopping for another meatball banh mi.   Oh. Washroom story! The stairs to their washroom were locked when I wanted to go. They unlocked it for me. The stairs and the slight hallway to the washroom were quite dark. I was sorely tempted to turn on my phone flashlight. The washroom was clean, but I'm not one for terror/horror, so going down dark hallways isn't my jam. Adventure in the dark before you can do your business. You have been warned."}
{"text":"i love this place, their sandwiches are always made wit fresh and delicious ingredients. their lemon grass chicken nam and their coconut shrimp nam are sooo flavourful with loads of cilantro on soft-on-the-inside, crusty-on-the-outside breads.  The sandwiches are definitely more expensive than their Chinatown counterparts, but the ingredients are of better quality.  I do wish they were a lil more affordable or had slightly bigger sandwiches for its price.  But the price is definitely still worth it for me, and I'll keep on going back."}
{"text":"Very delicious!  And the price is amazing!  Any of the items on their menu are a great choice!  My favourites are the grilled beef, pork belly, and lavong fish."}
{"text":"I work close to here and there aren't that many lunch options so I was absolutely thrilled to see a sandwich shop open nearby, and banh mi too!   The staff were super friendly. The prices are a bit more expensive than banh mi typically is, I think they're around 6.99 or 7.99 but they are really big, so I think it is pretty comparative in the end.   I tried the chicken option and it was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Fantastic little gem near Bellwoods Park. Thought it was better then Banh mi boys. The bun is long & thin, but most importantly....very soft & fresh. BMB I found to be too hard.  Average price is around $6 for a big sandwich."}
{"text":"Atmosphere It's a simple grab and go type of shop. They do offer a fair amount of seating inside.   Food We ordered a pulled pork banhmi, a pulled pork bao, and a beef bao. Not exactly sure what kind of Sriracha this shop uses, BUT it is spicy versus your normal one (we were obsessed!) In the states, banhmi shops, don't sell baos, so this was quite unique for the two of us. The bread on the banhmi wasn't overly crispy, but the downside is the sandwich is pretty skinny for the value."}
{"text":"*the price range of Nam Sandwich shop is obviously more expensive than the cheap Nguyen Huong banh mi in Chinatown. Seriously, you can't beat the price of $2.75 large banh mi in Nguyen Huong.  *there won't be cold cuts or those delicious unhealthy lard/pate on your sandwiches. At a reasonable price point, Nam offers some traditional and fusion touches to your daily Viet subs.  *Lavong Fish + Namslaw + Thai Ice Tea:  I can't describe how much I love this banh mi, it reminds me of my childhood in Vietnam *sobs* :'). The fish Nam used here was catfish marinated in turmeric, then stir fried in dills and fish sauce, and Nam's version of the dish was exactly what I had in Ha Noi. The turmeric give the fish an incredible pop of yellow color, stir fried with dill and it releases the most mouthwatering fragrance. It's hard to describe the flavor of this sandwich unless you try it out yourself. The ingredients are incredibly simple, yet it definitely delivered a big punch of flavor.  I will say some people might not like abundance of dills and the oiliness from the fish, but this is how this dish is supposed to be. I didn't try the namslaw as I was mesmerized with the catfish lol. But my friend seemed to like it, and she gave a big thumbs up to the Thai Ice Tea as it was creamy and not too sweet.  *Fried Egg Banh Mi + Yam Fries + Minty Lemonade:  The owner will ask how you would like the egg to be done and I say pick the gooey egg yolk than the more well-done fried egg. The baguette was crunchy on the outside yet incredibly soft on the inside. The fried egg was lightly salted, together with the soft baguette and fresh toppings, the ingredients were flawlessly combined to create a harmonious flavor.  The yam fries were your typical fries, however the curry mayonnaise sauce was the highlight here. The curry flavor in the sauce was light, not overpowering and surprisingly complimented the sweet potato fries very well. I could tell the lemonade was freshly made with no sugar or additives. It was refreshing and not overly sweet, exactly what I needed on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Diggin the Viet sandwiches here, reasonable prices for above unique sandwiches in the Viet cuisine. Ordered the catfish and the lemon grass chicken sandwiches which both were tasty. The menu is simple on a blackboard. The seating is spacious and clean. A must go to again."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, okay rolls, good location.   I've tried 3 of 6 or 7 sandwich options on the menu. It's a real cute spot right by Trinity Bellwoods Park so you can grab a little lunch and eat al fresco. All of the ones I tried are super yummy and want to try the rest. The baguette bread is fresh and crisp on the outside (not too hard that it cuts up the roof of your mouth) and the fillings are super tasty. I haven't had the baos but hear they're good too. The summer rolls are traditional Vietnamese rice paper rolls filled with vermicelli, herbs, and a protein (I had shrimp and pork). As a Vietnamese person, I make these at home on occasion and fill mine up how I like so I'm pretty biased toward my own creation. However I've had these at traditional Vietnamese restos before and there's just too much vermicelli for my liking... It feels like a filler and they're cheaping out on the good stuff, the shrimp and stuff. Good dipping sauce, but I like to dip a lot (especially with all that bland vermicelli) so that could just be me. Sweet potato fries are good, and the curry mayonnaise is awesome.   The atmosphere is super laid back with a large communal table and a few single tables. Nice and roomy, unlike Banh Mi Boys further east. Nam recently got a huge cooler for drinks but didn't seem to do the job of keeping the drinks cold. It seemed a little empty too with only a few choices of bottled soda but maybe they plan on filling it with take out food...I think that would be the best use of the cooler case. We'll have to wit and see!   While I still prefer BMB, I really do like the food here and will be back if I'm in the neighbourhood. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times.. haven't been back since. Sandwiches are a little lack lustre, and  tend to skimp on the meat. Asked for extra meat, and they couldn't accommodate the request. Found this a bit odd as anywhere else would see this as standard. After eating banh mi boys, it's hard to compare. Their buns are a little on the crusty side and found myself needing water just to take the next bite. Till we get a viet sandwich shop in the Trinity-Bellwood area though, this will have to do."}
{"text":"Nam Sandwich shop is an affordable lunch or dinner stop located just a few steps west of Bellwoods Park. The space is open and clean, making it a nice place to grab a bite, Asian fusion style. Banh Mi sandwiches are what had me wanting to check them out, so I was surprised to see that bao ($4), spring rolls ($5), yam fries ($5) and a few other snack options are also available here. The prices are really affordable which makes it easy to try more than one item on the menu when you visit.  Must-try items: Grilled Beef Banh Mi Grilled Chicken Bao Spring Rolls  Nam faces a lively portion of Queen Street and catches ample sunlight throughout the afternoon hours. Staff members work quickly and attentively on each order and will bring it out to you when ready. Service is quite friendly and polite.   It's a pretty comfortable, casual place to dine and the banh mi stands out from others I've tried. They serve it in a longer, thinner bun filled with slightly less toppings, which I find easier to digest. Business hours are from 11am to 7pm, making it an option that's easy on the wallet for me. I'll be back soon to try the minty lemonade and some of the other sandwich offerings."}
{"text":"A great spot to grab lunch to go, or if you have more time to sit and eat. I had their tofu sandwich, very tasty with great seasoning and sauces.   I'd highly recommend trying the minty lemonade, very refreshing and perfect to grab and then visit nearby trinity bellwoods!"}
{"text":"They didn't have a single classic-style sandwich, you know the one w/ liverwurst-esque spread, cold cuts & vinegary dressing. I had to settle for beef & it just wasn't the same.  I like the ambience though & the server was sweet."}
{"text":"Food **** Service *** Ambiance *** (Out of 5)  I've only been here twice and both times ordered grilled steak.  First time was a bao, second time was a banh mi sandwich.    Banh mi boys (Queen West / Spadina) still takes the crown but for a West Queen West shop near my apartment,  Nam is welcome addition to the neighbourhood and will on my short list."}
