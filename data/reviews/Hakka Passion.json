{"text":"Walked into Hakka Passion since it just opened up. The interior of the restaurant is comfortable, clean and cozy. The lady at the counter was friendly. Took out 4 dishes and my family loved it. The food was fresh, delicious, and plentiful. I got 10% off because I paid cash even before the 10% off the price was reasonable.
Hakka Passion great job! I'll be seeing you guys again. My family loved your food."}
{"text":"Opening night and definitely a good impression :) there weren't many people so I'm not sure if they did much marketing, but it was kinda nicer cause we could take our time and enjoy ;)

Staff here are superb! Very attentive & takes initiative. Absolutely lovely! I certainly hope that when this place starts filling up and getting busy, they will keep that up. It's always nice to come to a sit down restaurant where the staff are so pleasant. 

We started off with deep fried chicken wings. The wings meat was juicy and cooked really well. Then we got shrimp in lobster sauce. I found it a bit on the salty side but honestly, I don't much care for shrimp anyway.  My boyfriend ordered a yellow curry chicken. It was really spicy but the flavor was great! The waitress let us know that you can request for less to no spicy haha. After all, they want to make sure it's edible for everyone.

I ordered the beef pad Thai. It was a bit sweeter than I'm use to but it has just enough tart flavoring to make it really appetizing. Plus chewy texture noodles. That's a win!

Give it a try!! They just opened up at the Harwood plaza. Plenty of parking!

Yum!!"}
{"text":"Tried the chilli chicken, tasted pretty good, it was spicy but not overwhelming. My only complain was the portion was kind of small for 12 dollars."}
