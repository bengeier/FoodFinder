{"text":"Great Pizza! Danny Boys never disappoints! Everything there is awesome!"}
{"text":"Got take out.  I had to eat much later than my family, but the food (even cold) was GREAT!!!  Loved the house salad and cannot wait to visit the restaurant to try it fresh!"}
{"text":"We order from here every Friday. Excellent old world style, authentic Italian style food."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Danny Boys. I love coming home after a long day of work and calling in my order. My kids LOVE the food there, and my husband too. I highly recommend giving one of their pasta dishes a try- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sinatra, Dean, Sammy . . . roomy atmosphere. We've been here often enough and pretty much easily call it \"our place\". Even when it's busy there's room. They make a good Martini - from their martini list and that's no easy trick, if you ask me! We are trying to choose something new every visit. Being a creature of habit, I do want to get that angel hair pizza again soon... light and tasty!! MUSIC - LIVE MUSIC - each time we've been there there is live music and I love that this local place makes that available. I'd recommend Danny Boy's as a great choice for a group... just the two of us enjoy it often!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, the service, not so much. There were 8 in our party and we waited Oover an hour and a half for our food. Then they still didn't  bring one of the dinners.  I understand they just opened the Broadview Hts location, and would like to go back after they have been open longer.  Maybe the service will improve."}
{"text":"Although the 'main event' pizza was tasty it was very disappointing in the depth of the pizza, it was very thin and not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Came on high recommendations and for the most part it lived up to the hype. Atmosphere was pretty cool with the rat pack theme. However, took a minute for us to be seated even though two people saw us come in and they weren't busy. One plate was dirty and our waitress was just okay. I wasn't a huge fan of their pepperoni although my wife's \"peters\" pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"Live right by Danny Boys and we finally decided to try it. Honestly, the last year I've lived here I thought it was a cabaret of some sort. Not a very attractive looking restaurant from the outside. The interior of the restaurant was such a pleasant surprise. Very clean and had a great welcoming feel. 
Unfortunately, the service was slow and the food was nothing great. I ordered a melt and it was oily and nothing to brag about. The pizza we ordered was also subpar. I wanted to ask for a side of sauce because it lacked flavor. I will say the flies were yummy, but I mean that's a given. 
On a last note, the menu is outrageously large. Too many items in my opinion. Made it hard to decide and I feel like much if it was just over kill. Overall, wasn't too impressed with the service or food, but I would come back for the bar, it had a cool, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's so much nicer here than the one in Rocky River where you have to wait a month for a table.    The food is all fantastic and large portions.  It's slightly expensive for pizza in the area but well worth it.  They have lots of other options with sandwiches, calzones, and pasta.  My favorite appetizer is the Bada Bing Chips.  Potato chips covered in melted cheese, buffalo sauce and blue cheese sprinkles!

The decor is fun and the servers are friendly.  Well worth a trip.  The only oddity is the music.  If you're posting pictures of the rat pack on the wall and naming everything after gangsters why are you playing top 20 hits?  Put on some Frank Sinatra!"}
{"text":"This is a good alternative to the boring chain places on Rockside for my picky relatives (although I'd say the decor and prices are equivalent).  They have an extensive menu of pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, and pretty much every manifestation of dough + toppings that you can imagine.  To say that the portions are generous is an understatement.  This is not the place for authentic Italian cuisine, but for outrageous artery-clogging fare that might be featured on Man vs Food (like macaroni and cheese and potato chips on pizza.  together.)  Our waitress was nice and did a good job, but it took a noticably long time for a food to come out (nearly an hour).  I would not recommend going here with the intent to eat anything remotely healthy."}
{"text":"Lazy, and relies way too much on carbs. Food and drinks are overpriced and when one menu item is a sandwich filled with spaghetti and meatballs this place is just another example of Parma trash."}
{"text":"I would like to give Danny Boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that I've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. I really haven't found a pizza I can devote myself to in this area. 

The garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. We really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. Very tasty pepperoni and Parmesan recipe. 

The regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin.

Some of the specialty pizzas really looked good. Can't wait to try them. 

It's not Coccia House, but what is."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up.  Place was empty, but looked nice.  They didn't have a kids menu so ordered a small pizza and an order of spaghetti.  I got a deep dish pizza.  All was tasty, but costly.  I plan to go back, just not in the near future."}
{"text":"Danny Boys is a small, local chain of Rat Pack themed Italian restaurants in NE Ohio. The Broadview Heights location, on Broadview Road features a bar into the center of a moderately large dining room with a variety of seating options and a space for live entertainment. There is hosted trivia on Thursdays. The sizable menu features a broad variety of Italian classics, pizzas, pastas, chicken parm as well as sandwiches and burgers. We've visited as a family many times and have always had good service. This visit we tried ravioli, a pesto BLT wrap, angel hair pasta, a house salad, and chicken pesto Flatbread with goat cheese. All of the dishes were enjoyed and there were many leftovers. The BLT wrap was huge; one half was enough for dinner. The ravioli portion was big enough to allow for half for lunch tomorrow also. All the dishes were enjoyed although the Flatbread could have used more goat cheese. With pop and an appetizer, dinner for 5 with a nice tip came to $93.

This is a good restaurant to meet friends, have a gathering, or even meet for business. There are TVs around showing sports, friendly prompt service and pretty good food."}
{"text":"Went to Danny Boys today and had the bacon burger.   Should have known better.   Never order a burger at an Italian restaurant.   The burger wasn't very good.   Not surprisingly it tasted like fried meatballs.   Just not very good."}
{"text":"Stick to the pizza here. We've been here a couple times before (Rocky River location has better service) and always get the Clevelander pizza. We had a Living Social coupon this time so we stopped by and ate at the bar. We experienced neglectful service even though we were one of three parties in the whole restaurant and we were not impressed with our sub and woogie melt. We will stick to our favorite place down the street, Antonio's, going forward."}
{"text":"i don't like sausage on a pizza, or i thought i didn't until i had the Chicago (deep dish pizza) at Danny Boy's. 
this may have been the best pizza i've ever had in my life - honestly incredible. i want another and i'll have another. soon.
Danielle had a Chicken Philly and Fries pizza. Brian, our server, came out to let us know her pizza had gotten slightly burned while cooking. he boxed that pizza up and gave it to us to take home and then had a new pizza made for her to eat there. he also offered her a salad, which she declined, but it was nice of him to offer. the customer service was incredible."}
{"text":"I typically like my food served hot which wasn't the case here. The sauce was quite thick and tasty but sadly that was the highlight. For such a pricey, yes pricey, place I would have desired higher service from the bartender as we sat at the bar.  And really, why not  fresh instead if watery canned mushrooms on my calzone. Sad but this is my second time and I stand by my 3-stars.  I truly wish I could give more."}
{"text":"Got the deep dish pizza. A LOT OF DOUGH, almost no cheese. Not what anyone expected from a deep dish pizza. Toppings were good quality, above average. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!! You can't order anything bad here and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. My only complaint is that it is often understaffed which leads to slow service."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday, expecting the place to be packed (especially during lent), but we were seated right away.  The best part of our experience was our waiter, Brian.  He was very engaging and friendly, making jokes and recommendations the whole time we were there. As for the food, it was ok. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, and those were tasty.  I also really enjoyed the garlic rolls that came with my meal. I could eat those til the cows come home as they had the perfect amount of flavor; any more would have been overpowering, but these were delicious.  I ordered the \"Mac and cheese\" which came with bacon, broccoli, and chicken mixed into the sauce and noodles. I liked the sauce, but I think the broccoli flavor overpowered the dish a little bit.  That was the overall flavor of the meal instead of the cheese or bacon flavor I would have liked.  It is an enormous portion, so expect to have leftovers.  I will be making a return visit, but I'll probably try one of the sandwiches or some pizza next time"}
{"text":"Not loving it....  Everything is butter soaked.. I ordered a Vegas veggie sandwich.  It was tasteless.   Bread stick appetizers were dripping in butter.  Tomato sauce is below average.  Will not go back.  Not recommend for people on a diet or folks that have coronary problems...."}
{"text":"We recently visited the Broadview Heights Danny Boys for the second time since they opened. Our first vist we had 4 people there. The waitress took our drink and food order quickly and the place wasn't to busy at all. We ordered a large pizza and a fold over. After about 45 minutes the waitress came to our table with a order of bread sticks and said they were on the ouse because the kitchen was so backed up. 

Our second visit we had 13 people and again the food took forever to come out. Everyone ordered pizzas expect for the kids, they ordered chicken fingers. This time we didn't score any free bread sticks though.

The food is good. I suggest trying the Chicago pizza, its great. If you plan on going there just make sure you have enough time as this place clearly isn't the place you go for a good quck pizza. It's worth checking out though, good food, good tunes and good decor. 

Faster service and it's a four star...."}
{"text":"Took the girls out to lunch on the second day of public business for Danny Boy's.  This is the same location as the old Piper's III, (again, with the possessive apostrophe?) which had been there since a few days after the dawn of time.  They've done a bang-up job on the interior and look like they have some more things to do outside, too; perhaps paving the south parking lot, which looks now like overflow or something.

So, the service:  Wonderful.  Smiling, attentive, everyone sends the message that you are an honored guest.  Great way to run a restaurant, or any business.

The food:  They're not trying to \"break new ground\" or \"send a message\" with their food, nor are they \"creating a new paradigm\" or being \"cutting edge,\" and I think I've depleted my \"air quotes\" for about \"another year.\"  This is pretty basic, straight-forward Eye Talian pizza and pasta, with just a teensy tinesy bit of newish (but not new!) twists to the menu. \"Knuckle Sandwiches.\"  \"Woogie Melts.\"  And the menu is a bit more than I could read, in one sitting.  Yeah, there are pictures of the food.  Geez.  Not simple line drawings, either.  Real photos.  \"Just drool and point, dear.  Drool.  And.  Point.\"

If you don't like either a) Frank Sinatra's singing or b) Frank Sinatra's smiling mug, you may not feel comfortable in the dining room, where Frank's presence is on every surface, including many of the server's shirts.  This is a place your parents, or grand-parents, or perhaps your bookie will feel right at home.  For a brand new place, it feels like an old pair of slippers, or the place you take the guy who just served your wife her papers.  Y'know, family.

\"I'm gonna live till I die.\"

{"text":"Possibly one of my favorite Italian/pizza places, because it's just that good. 

Four reasons:
1. I am addicted to Woogies (kind of like a small calzone), I build my own with pepperoni and banana peppers...
2. The actual calzones are like the size of a dinner plate...
3. They have the fluffiest & most delicious garlic twists...
4. They have a deep dish. 
5. Ok I lied. FIVE reasons. They accommodate my picky kids' weird pasta requests. (Buttered noodles with meat sauce on the side)

And if all of that isn't enough, they LOVE Frank Sinatra. This spot is a little bit of a drive for us, but it's near the top of our family favorites!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. \"Best garlic bread ever.\" My kids quote. But service is kind of slow. Took a long time to bring out food. Not quoting the time because maybe it was just the wrong timing of things). We did go back the second time and it took about the same time, maybe 5 min quicker. So I'm general food is good but you have to have patience and a lot of time to be served."}
{"text":"Gave this place several attempts since it's newer. The service is horrendous from being seating to bringing drinks let alone food. (Nobody ordered a deep dish pizza, no reason a sandwich/apps should take so long) The chips appetizer  came from a bag so don't bother, and the Charlie Two Time (essentially a chicken philly) was DISGUSTING. Why was this sandwich so nasty you want to know? 1. The chicken was BONE DRY. Eck. (Reminds me the previous visit I got a pizza with chicken on it and it was also BONE DRY) #2 It is supposed to have some sort of mayo on it, barely there and I didn't want to bother waiting 30 minutes for waitress to bring it to me... The onions and green peppers on the sandwich are raw... of course why spend extra time cooking them... then my food would have taken 2 hours.  (I double checked the menu and they are indeed supposed to be SAUTÉED...so someone decided a short cut was in order) The mushrooms on the sandwich came from some sort of Sysco jar I'm sure. grosss! gross! and DOUBLE GROSS! The cheese on top was cold (which could have been my fault bc I was in the bathroom) but it made it the perfect disgusting mess. 

Husband ordered the clevelander botanical (I know it sounds like an exhibit at the gardens at university circle, not appetizing at all much like the actual pizza pie they bring out) Actually reverse that, it looked appetizing, if you could get it into your mouth...It's a soggy gross disaster (I tried a piece, since I didn't want to touch the nasty dish above) UGH SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. The only positive thing about the meal was the Xmas ale ... and that's not positive since we were over charged...

Brings me to my next point, we got all of this ickiness for ONLY 40 bucks. (Plus my hubby might have had another large bud light) ONLY 40.00 to make  you sick to your stomach while Frankie and Dean make you deaf and you are surrounded by old people and kids which you will wait an hour to enjoy. After 3 times Danny Boys is retired in our book. Stay away. Far away. The whole way home we talked about all the other places we would have rather spent 40.00. I would have rather at a burger from McDonalds drive through, it was THAT bad. (I'm also embarassed I told my parents to go here one night they wanted to try Cork and Cleaver, but it was closed so they went to Danny Boys, no wonder when I asked my dad he hmm'd he probably wondered why on earth I told him to try it..."}
{"text":"Service was good. Pizza was fabulous and the restaurant was all around clean. Will probably visit again."}
{"text":"My family came in to eat tonight. My 5 year old was served and ate some partially frozen chicken tenders. I asked to speak to a manager and she was barely apologetic and didn't quite know how to handle our situation. The next manager apologized profusely and assured us it was pre-cooked chicken tenders. To my wife and I it looked raw and translucent. I have to say it is pretty scary thinking your child may have consumed raw chicken and I don't feel this was handled right. I don't like to leave bad reviews but I also don't like feeling as though my child may have been put in danger which is obviously what comes first."}
{"text":"Took my mom and my nephew and niece beer for Mother's Day. Big disappointment line was long and slow moving for the buffet and the food wasn't that good or hot and the kids nor was I happy about the food. Gave my mother a coupon for mothers. Day but I didn't receive any and had to ask for more water and wait for another 5 mins to get the refill. We stopped on our way home to get ice cream since it wasn't rally that filling. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This Danny Boys recently opened and we've never been to any of their locations before. It was a Saturday evening when we went so when we were told it would be a 45 minute wait we were okay with that. When the 45 minutes turned out to be only 20 we were very pleased. 

The menu was of good size. Pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and much more to choose from. We started with buffalo potato chips as a appetizer.  It was pretty good. I would have liked some scallions or maybe sour cream on them.  Just kinda seemed like chips, cheese, and hot sauce.  Our entrees took an extremely long time to arrive. We hadn't noticed as we were being entertained by a balloon artist / magician and a violinist. Fun times. But the server apologized and brought us some bread sticks and sauce anyways.  These were very good!  The bread sticks were handmade, braided, fluffy, and warm. The best.  After the complimentary appetizer was done our pizza arrived.  All but one of us was sharing the pizza - she ordered a sandwich.  The pizza had perogies, kilbasa, peppers, and onions on it.  As silly as it sounds - It's award winning and an awesome pizza! I can't wait to return and try one of their other unique pizza offerings.  The sandwich didn't arrive in time. Instead,  we all ended up sharing the pizza and then a second complementary appetizer (homemade cheese sticks).  We never complained about anything but the server and manager were very proactive in making sure we were happy. And as a result we were. We're chalking it up to grand opening jitters and coming back soon. The staff and their attentiveness as well as their food offered will make Danny Boys a very popular place."}
{"text":"We used to love to come here. My husband loves the chicken parm. The chicken tasted low-grade in my opinion and tasted pumped up and not a good texture. Anyway I guess I should have known better when ordering the margherita  pizza, no fresh mozzarella ! Could not find it anywhere on the menu and the fresh basil was a joke it was flakes!!!! Good service and I love the music they play very nice . But... they are skimping on the food quality in my opinion. The prices are high too ! so I say if they want to charge that much , take some pride in your ingredients ! Probably our last visit which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"-I'll Make Better Choices Next Time-

Let me start out by saying that Danny Boys had a great, polite, and quick service staff. That is extremely important.

My girlfriend and I went on a double date here a few nights ago. We were able to be seated right away, and soon after the place seemed full. The atmosphere of the place was nice, but I would have liked to have more windows. The booths weren't very comfortable, so that was also a bit of a bummer.

Aside from those small criticisms, the food was excellent.

My girlfriend got a Woogie Melt, which looked delicious.

I had gotten the Bronx Burger, which was alright. It was a completely average burger. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that burgers aren't the draw. It is an Italian place after all.

Our friends got Calzones. We were all amazed to see how great the portions were. A small Calzone is big enough for one person, and a medium is about the size of a medium pizza. They both boasted about how good it was.

I'm sure that I will go back, but next time I'll be sure to order a Calzone or a Woogie Melt. I recommend to try this place, but pass on the burgers.

Giving it a 4 star review because of my girlfriend and friends experiences."}
{"text":"People keep complaining that their food took forever.. My waitress explained that the deep dish pizzas were made to order and take awhile to cook... Knowing that we ordered an appetizer and drinks and were prepared to sit and hang out. 
We ended up being there on a night with live entertainment and we were very impressed by the music and fun atmosphere! There is so much to look at on the walls and in the display cases! 
After waiting awhile for our pizzas, they finally came out and WOW were we blown away! The food was beyond amazing!!!!!!! 
Bravo Danny Boys! You just got your newest set of regulars!"}
{"text":"Used to go to the River location often when I lived on the Westside. I now go to the Broadview Heights location and the food is great! The service has always been so so at either location, but the food makes up for it. REAL better ingredients, better pizza! Nothing in B heights or Royalton comes close!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Portions are big.  Cool Rat Pack-Sopranos decor.  But the overall experience only rated 3 stars.  I expected more."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to the location in Ricky River, and thought I'd give this one a try. The location is a little bit out of the way for me, but it's right off the highway on the main street, so wasn't hard to find.

Food is consistent just like the one on the west side. I had a DB's bistro salad with chicken and a Chicago pizza. Sales was fresh and delicious. Loved the goat cheese and crane berries in it. The Italian sausage on the pizza is a little bit tough to my taste, but still good. The hostess/ waitress was very polite and friendly. I was there at an odd time, so the place is almost empty but me.

I would have come back there if I lived in that area. Definitely a nice place to visit for the locals."}
{"text":"The food at this place tasted great. And it was a game day so I was loving the drink specials. Also just the look of this establishment in general was pretty awesome. The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because when I went it was freezing. Like we were at our table shivering. Actually shivering. But it wasn't just cold. It took a long time to get our entree. If it wasn't for college the tall beer and football I almost didn't notice. But everyone got food around the same time but we were there an hour be for them. The service was good tho and as I said the food was amazing. Next turn the heat on. Cause I will be back."}
{"text":"I love the Rocky River location close to where I live and now I can order Danny Boys catering now that the Broadview Heights location opened by my work! Score! 
Last week  I called just after 11 when they opened and they were able to delivery in about an hour lunch for 6 at my business meeting. Friendly service, fair price (we have a per head price we can't go over and they can meet it), good food, reliable delivery- perfect!  Thank you Danny Boys, pizza makes work meetings MUCH more fun."}
{"text":"Danny Boys \"sets the bar\" for me in EXCELLENT customer service!  ALSO - the pizza ROCKED!!!!  Had a little minor issue and Matt the manager was outstanding in making the situation right!  More businesses need to take note!  Because of the outstanding service and food - I will tell everyone I know about this place!  Keep up the great job :)  Can't wait to come back for my next pie :)"}
{"text":"Oh Danny...I want to like you so much more than I do. 
Don't get me wrong, this place has it's good points, I've just had so much better. The decor is fun with it's Frank Sinatra style with a hint of old diner. Of course the menu is themed to accommodate. 

The portions here are HUGE. I mean, the \"bread-sticks\" are \"medium loaves of bread\" huge. The appetizer comes with five of them. FIVE loaves of garlic-y bread. The actual garlic bread was a large loaf cut in half. I was full before the pizza even came. 
I have one big issue with the pizza and it may have been my fault, but our server should have asked. We ordered the deep dish assuming we were going to get Chicago style. Now, either they have two types of deep dish and she gave us the regular one or the deep dish here is terrible. I am willing to admit that maybe, had I asked for Chicago, I may have actually gotten Chicago. However, since the waitress didn't think to ask what kind I wanted, I'm going to operate under the assumption that Danny does not know what deep dish is. It was basically just a moderately deep pizza. Sauce on the bottom, cheese and pepperoni on top. Fine, but NOT deep dish. The crust was what really threw me off though. It was basically bread. I could rip it apart and make a sandwich with it. Good but weird. 

This review is confusing. I'm even confusing myself by reading it over. I apologize and will tell you that the confusion must just be part of Danny boys experience. Now that I know what to expect, maybe I will return and try to have better time."}
{"text":"I still like the taste of the food, but sad to say the overall experience is overpriced at this location. Soggy pizza, whaddayawant attitude, almost dead on a Friday night. I don't blame any of the staff, tend to blame management for this sort of thing. They could really improve things with training... 

Much prefer the Rocky River location that's always been on top of things."}
{"text":"Great place - try the Chicago style pizza - bravo!  This place used to be Pipers - so I don't know where the octegenarians are going these days but Danny Boy's was a pleasant surprise.  Nice decor (Sinatra/Rat Pack theme), really good food and great prices.  Give them a try.  It was better deep dish pizza than I've had in a number of places in Chicago."}
{"text":"OK, first visit here and it wasn't great, but we'll go back and try it again. 

I had the Baked Meatballs Molisanti which is three large meatballs with sauce and \"pizza cheese\" as the menu says. Meatballs were ok, all the cheese had melted off the top and slid together on one side of the meatballs, and there wasn't enough sauce to really taste it. I could have asked for more but they take a while to serve and wasn't in the mood to wait.  I'd give that dish one star. 

My wife got the Portofino Personal Pie, a 4 piece pizza and she ordered onions and mushrooms on it. The bottom was soggy, the sauce had that metallic taste and overall flavor was  worthy of two stars AT BEST. 

Yes, we'll go back because 1) This is Broadview Heights, home of...well, almost nothing good casual restaurant-wise 2) Theirs is a  HUGE menu and I'm sure we'll find stuff we like--at least I hope so, and 3) It hasn't been open that long and it does sometimes take restaurants a while to put things together.  And when we go back I will absolutely review it again. Considering there are plenty of good reviews for this location already I'm truly hopeful future visits will be much better. 

We'll see."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the italian feel of it when you walk in. Every time I have gone it has been packed and to me that is a good sign of good business! Even though the wait may be long on a Friday or Saturday night, it is worth it. If you don't feel like waiting its best to go earlier. Besides that, everything I have ordered off their menu I have liked. The deep dish Chicago style pizza is amazing. It takes a little longer to cook so I always order their half size portion salads before because its more than enough. Their portions are huge. All of their salads are really good especially their Texas Grilled Chicken Salad and their Chopstix & Fingers salad. I really like the Deans pizza as well."}
{"text":"Danny Boy's is a fun, low-key restaurant. The menu is extensive with sandwiches, pizzas, pastas and salads. My favorite is the chopsticks and fingers salad which has chicken fingers, breadsticks and a delicious honey mustard dressing. The pizza is good too with many toppings to choose from. The restaurant walls are filled with Rat Pack memorabilia but the music playing is modern and doesn't match the decor. The one downside is the service that can be hit or miss-sometimes perfect, sometimes overbearing and sometimes nonexistent. Danny Boy's is a fun and delicious place for an easy meal."}
{"text":"I dropped by here to watch a buddy's blues and rock band play. I've been trying to get to Danny Boys, except the one in Lakewood. I figured they would be about the same. 

I heard a lot of good things about Danny Boys, specifically that they have a Chicago style pizza that stands up to actual Chicago pizza. I was a bit disappointed. The pizza was okay, but it pales in comparison to my favorite deep dish pizza from the windy city. I'd be willing to go back here if they have more bands playing."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for a good deep dish pizza in the area and I finally found it.  There are so many things that look good on their menu though that it's hard to decide what to order. I've never been disappointed with any of my food choices there and service has always been great. I also love the decor."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food. Our group of 7 got a table in no time and had fun with the deck of cards in the napkin holder. 

Started with cheesy bread and sauce. Definitely enough for 2, if not 3, people, and totally worth it - very soft, doughy, warm, and melty. The 3 of us who split the cheesy bread also shared a Clevelander pizza, described as the meeting of NY and Chicago style. It's a deep dish pizza made upside-down, with the pepperoni and cheese below the sauce. Everyone enjoyed it, especially the dough. 

If you want a Chicago style, make sure you specify Chicago deep dish. Others in our group ordered a deep dish hoping for Chicago style, but it was just a regular deep dish. Nonetheless, it looked delicious.

Overal, pretty good experience. Some other things on the menu I'd like to try, so I'll probably be back sometime."}
{"text":"Great dough! Great service! We stopped for a quick dinner. Salad, pizza, and woogie  bear were all fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"This one DOESN'T COMPARE to the one in Rocky River. I don't understand why not, but it just doesn't make it. 
The ambiance was lacking also. 
However, the wait staff was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Basic \"Italian\" chain restaurant.

The food isn't always great and the service is sometimes spotty. Especially these last couple times.  

The good - house french fries, \"breadsticks\", bings buffalo woogie
The bad - service is sometimes spotty, it can take a while to get your food sometimes even when the restaurant isn't full, issues with cross contamination*

Danny Boys hasn't always been mediocre, it used to be pretty good when they first opened this location however it has gone down hill recently.  I wouldn't recommend you to go out of the way to visit.  However if your in the neighborhood and wanting some pizza, subs, calzones or you're meeting friends here it's not bad.  

*contamination issue - my sister has celiac disease and while an Italian restaurant isn't normally an option Danny Boy's boasts the fact they have a gluten free menu.  Even with explaining the allergy including the need to cook everything in clean pans and to make sure the cooks change their gloves to both the server and the manager she still managed to get extremely sick from a chicken salad.  Celiacs/Gluten Free beware!"}
{"text":"I tried the pizza twice.  Both times the dough was undercooked and soggy.  I will not try this place again."}
{"text":"The wings are basically what you can get in your local supermarket freezer. The bread on any sandwich, calzone, pizza etc is always soggy and never crisp. Also if you order to go, expect your food cold. Even when they make you wait 15 minutes for it. Overrated place with overpriced food. Again, watch out for soggy dough."}
{"text":"Great place for some pizza, Italian type sandwiches, and various pasta dishes! To be honest, the first time I went here a couple years ago, it was underwhelming. Because of that, I haven't been back until recently. The decor is nice and clean and even the bathroom is very nice. The wait staff is very friendly and they go out of their way to help give you the best experience possible. Onto the food- I ordered Italian wedding soup to start and it came with a garlic knot type bread. Both were amazing! The rest of my family ordered garlic bread with cheese and mozzarella sticks to share between them. They were saying that they were pretty good but nothing better than any other restaurant. As for my meal, I shared a pizza with my dad. We got a New York style (thin crust) cheese pizza. I have to say it was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. I would strongly recommend coming here."}

When I drove by Danny Boys, I honestly didn't think that I was going to like it.  I mean, where is the minimalist exposed brick and terse waitstaff?  That and there is wayyy too much ample parking for my taste!  

Danny Boys really blew me away though.  It's large, has an open bar and open feeling, lots of TVs, lots of fun kitsch on the walls....and I haven't even gotten to the food yet!  

They have a huge menu with about anything you could think of.  We ordered an appetizer pizza with ricotta, mushrooms and spinach.  It was delicious and the size was much larger than what I'd expected under the \"appetizer pizza\" menu.  My bf got the Tony Soprano (spaghetti, meatballs, on a sub bun) and I got a brisket turnover with pub cheese sauce.  We left full and happy and I asked for another cup of that cheese sauce because (*explicative*) it was awesome!  (Side note:  I've been trying to figure out what's in it for days...please Danny Boys...I must know!)

Our server Brando (Really? Come on!) was on top of things, despite being short staffed.  He kept our respective drinks full and was absolutely engaging!  I also want to add just how fun it was to see the place packed, with lots of families and balloon hats.  It was a fun time and I loved the food!  

We'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great wait service. Breadsticks very light, fluffy, and tasty. Marinara sauce fresh and very good. Pizza was very good, made from fresh ingredients.  Frank Sinatra stuff everywhere. I'll be back."}
