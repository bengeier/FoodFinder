{"text":"The food was good but the price was outrageous!  My friend and I went for lunch on Saturday.  We had never been before so we split an entree and app and each had a glass of wine.  When the bill came it was almost $70 with tip.  For that amount of money we could've been eating filet mignon and drinking champagne somewhere.  Very disappointing and don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"They deserve 4 stars for being the best chicken paprikash I have ever had at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Took my Mom there over Xmas and we had lunch.  The service was fine and the decor has been mentioned (quite dated, lots of kitsch). We ordered the potato pancakes as an appetizer and they did not appear homemade, perhaps frozen and fried in oil.  Tthin and large, not very tasty or well seasoned.  I ordered the goulash and it was ok, but bland, and contained one small piece of chicken.  My Mom ordered the schnitzel and it was fine, but very thin and tasted mostly of breading.  The spaetzel (dumplings) was cooked well, but again not sure if it was homemade or not.  Dessert was standard bakery stuff."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  However the staff could be a little more outgoing and friendly.  The place could use a update.  Try the cucumber salad."}
{"text":"The next best thing to my own own Hungarian mothers cooking."}
{"text":"Great Hungarian food, especially the chicken paprikash and dumplings!  Portions are big and tasty, you have enough for lunch the next day!  The interior could use some updating but the food by far is the highlight here!  Already looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"Coincidentally enough, I visited the same day (Memorial Day) as the previous reviewer.  It was a little strange eating in a completely empty dining room, but I thought the food was generally solid and extremely filling.

I started with the Sausage and Sauerkraut appetizer ($7).  The thin slices of sausage weren't anything special, but the paprika-spiced sauerkraut was well beyond anything I expected.  As Heather, the server (who I agree with the previous reviewer was great), explained, some folks even ask for the sauerkraut to top their mashed potatoes.  For a main entree, I went with a combo platter ($19) of two of Little Budapest's most popular dishes: Chicken Paprikash paired with a side of dumplings and the Weinerschnitzel.  The sauce for the paprikash was good and went well with the dumplings but the chicken seemed a little overcooked or perhaps had been sitting around too long.  I really enjoyed the Weinerschnitzel, which was pounded, breaded and fried just right to reach that perfect level of delicate crispiness.

The decor certainly isn't the Ritz, but I think works on the neighborhood restaurant level.  The wood paneling, pictures, and model cars on the walls left me with a homey feeling, without treading into faux-homey (or \"fomey\" as Clooney might say) territory.  I look forward to a future visit but am definitely forewarned to bring a big appetite."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Hungarian restaurant on the West Side. The staff seems to be 100 percent off-the-boat, and it shows, down to their refusal to acknowledge the hyperactive T.G.I.-Friday's American style of service. And, sure, the decor is right out of a small-town Dairy Queen, but I'll cut a place some slack if they have it where it counts: in the kitchen. And this place thankfully does. The chicken paprikas, cucumber salad and potato pancake I got were crazy delicious -- everything was a bit on the heavy side, but what do you expect from a national cuisine that practically considers sour cream a food group? I left full and happy."}
{"text":"True- the staff is not always friendly, the decor is beyond awful, and the prices are slightly more than I would want to pay, BUT the traditional Hungarian food is delicious and consistently well prepared. Get the combo platter- you'll be glad you did, because who can choose between stuffed cabbage and chicken paprikash? Next time we stop I must order the potato pancakes..."}
{"text":"Hungarian food fit for standard American tastes. Not spicy enough for me. More bland than flavorful, but Cleveland doesn't have much in the way of Hungarian restaurants anymore, so the Little Budapest has to do. If you don't think of it as Hungarian, and just as a generalized European restaurant, you'll be happy. The schnitzel is very good by the way, at least last time I ordered it. Prices, however, are too high for the image and quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my wife and 2 year old son. I was a bit scared at first - there was one other couple eating, but to be fair, it's a Monday night and holiday, so I gave that a pass. So glad I did - as we had a great experience!

Pros:
- The food. It was great. I had the Wiener Schnitzel (large - that was a mistake, as it was huge), and my wife had the Chicken Paprikash. Both were spectacular. I lived in Vienna for 6 months in college, and visit frequently, and I'd put this place up with the top places in Vienna. I could even hear the chef pounding the hell out of the meat in the back after I ordered it. That's fresh.
- Our server, Heather, was great. She treated our son like a king, and made sure we had everything we needed all the time. Great people and great service.
- The sides were great. Sauerkraut was made with paprika to give it an extra something, while my wife's dumplings - actually smaller than dumplings but larger than spaetzle, were perfectly cooked. 

Cons:
- OK, I'll be fair. The decor is terrible. Traditional Hungarian/German restaurant vibe - furniture from the 80's, decor outside to match. It was dark and a bit dingy feeling. Some sprucing up and paint would go a long way.

If you can get past the decor and just focus on the food - you'll be very happy. They could certainly use a touch of restaurant renovation TV show love - but I'd recommend the food and the service to anyone."}
{"text":"I was channeling my inner Zsa Zsa (or was it Ava?) last night, so mon cher chou, mia bonita and I headed out to Little Budapest.

THE FOOD:  The food is generally good and comforting, but not particularly well spiced.  Mon cher chou commented that the paprikas was a very toned down version of what he enjoyed in Hungary.  Still, it tastes like something wonderful that Gran would whip up to make you feel better.

It tastes like they've been doing this for a long time.  Sadly, the peas in my bakonyi had been cooked for a very, very long time and the dumplings had been boiled for a very long time.  Still the meat in the bakonyi was excellent and the schnitzel was light and expertly breaded and fried.  Potato pancakes were crisp and well seasoned.

THE DECOR:  Hello 1980s?  Yes, I found your stuff.  It's all there.

THE SERVICE:  A bit curt, but efficent."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the decor, despite what everyone has been saying -- it made me feel like I was in Europe. Outside it was Center Ridge road and a strip mall painted bright and white, but once I was inside the darkness of the wood panels and signs transported me to someplace medieval.

I can't speak for all the foods but the Budapest coffee was a super nice and considerate drink -- it was separated into three layers: the whip cream on top, the rum/coffee in the middle, and a chocolate syrup on the bottom. Perfect because I could have a taste of the syrup and skip the rest of it.

The menu is not cheap but I just went with appetizers and soups. I would come here again for soup and coffee, and then head over to Mulino down the strip for some sweet cookies."}
