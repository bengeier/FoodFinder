{"text":"Decided to check this place out a couple of Fridays ago after reading some of the reviews.  The first thing I noticed upon entering was a sign saying they didnt take the coupon some people have been complaining about.  The bar area to the left as you enter looks like what you might expect from a gastropub.  However the dining area on the right was kind of plain.  The beer list was a lot smaller than I had anticipated but what they did have was good.  I went with Chimayx2.  Always a good choice in my opinion.  Got the poutine for an appetizer and it was good.  Went with the MC burger(hold the onions).  It was a very good burger but the bacon was probably the best bacon I have ever had on a burger.  The 4 other people with me all really enjoyed their meals as well.   I definitely recommend this place and I am looking forward to going back and trying some other menu items."}
{"text":"So every now and then it is time to try that little hole in the \"shopping center\" in hopes of finding a local gem, well keep looking! First of all, I wished I would have checked yelp prior to going out to this place because my experience was similar if not identical to Chris B.  Our party decided to try Mad Chef after purchasing a coupon from restaurant.com. Let me just notify everyone.. HAD THERE NOT BEEN A COUPON WE WOULD NEVER HAD GONE!! The other party we were with uses the coupons often and has never had any issues thus far until tonight.  Upon arriving at the restaurant,  there were no cars around. Sign #1. We walked in to find no one in the dining room and a few patrons in the bar. Sign #2.  We are seated prompty in the dining room. Our server was friendly and asked if we like drinks. We checked out the beer menu and saw that there were some craft brews. We decided to each get a sample. I went with the \"hop head\". This was suppose to be three IPA style drafts. When served the sampler, I asked which was which, she has no idea. She knew one was 60 minute, gordons double ipa and smithwicks ??? What? She said that ran out of the other pale ale and gave me smithwicks. Sign #3.  I should also mention that they had four peaks pumpkin porter on draft. As I am a huge four peaks fan, but not much a porter fan I requested a sample of this years porter. I was flat out refused!!! My husband in the end decided to just get a pint, but seriously!! Sign #4   On to the food, it was ehhhh. Probably would have given the place another star had the next part of our adventure not occurred. Though I will point out, the food was not to the point that I would make a special trip out there. I mean they took costco frozen food and definetly spiced it up.  Now this is the part where I wish I would have checked yelp as I ususally do and we could have been at papago enjoying a taste of any beer and GOOD FOOD! So at the end of the meal we hand our server the restaurant.com coupon. She immediately points out that this should have been presented at the beginning of the meal and besides they don't take them anymore. WHAT??? But it is on the site, someone in my party paid for it, it is valid! I proceed to argue with her for a brief moment when she smartly decideds to bring over the manager.  What the manager does not understand is that I argue for a living, whethere I am right or wrong I can argue alll day!! Anyways, he starts giving me his sob story of how he requested not be on restaurants.com and there is a lawsuit, blah blah. I tell him it is not our fault they made a bad marketing decision, but not that bad because it got us in there right??  This goes on for another few minutes. I could care less about the $25 coupon, it was more of the princpal. He kept saying he would have \"worked a deal\" if we told him at the beginning about the coupon. How the heck were we to know? I told him he should post a sign and give notice. Long story short, he failed and refused to honor the coupon. Sign #5.   All he had to do was honor the coupon and there is a chance we may have been back. Now never. Also, if you are wondering how this place has any good reviews.... I would like to point out that those reviews are from yelpers with only 1 or 2 reviews... follow me??  What is the moral of this tale, READ YELP!!"}
{"text":"This place is ballin'.  I don't know if the other people that ate here just had a bad experience or what, but I frankly don't give a shit.  We went in here by simply stumbling into it, and were immediately impressed.  The decor and ambience is pretty charming, lots of brick and german beer signs.  Good selection of non-standard beers too, which is definitely a plus, but whoever said the food was just ok was either high, stupid, or had the exception to the rule.  We had the poutine (a Canadian delicacy...french fries smothered in gravy, cheese sauce and cheese curds) and couldn't put it down, we literally had to force ourselves to stop to save room for our food.  My wife ordered a wedge salad, and it was massive and totally fresh with big chunks of bacon.  She got a side of mac-n-cheese and it came in a bubbling little cauldron with a ton of bacon topping it, and it was gooey and heavenly.  I got the meatloaf melt sandwich, smothered with sauteed onions, stone ground mustard, and served on toasted sourdough bread, and it was EXCELLENT.  Either we have haters, snobs, old people, or a few one-off experiences littering the reviews for the joint because it's pretty snazzy.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I'm a lifelong NY Giants fan who misses the tri state area. Unfortunately, there's no way I'll be going back here. DH and I decided to have dinner here on a Monday night. Waited for 3 minutes before being told to seat ourselves, 10 more minutes for the waiter to come and take our drink order (we put in order for pretzel board at the same time) and 10 more minutes for the diet cokes to arrive. It's Monday and we're not in a hurry, so no big deal, even if this guy moves like molasses. Then he comes back; no pretzel board. We ordered the Spinach dip. When it came out it was cold and the chips were burned. Still wanted to love them and was willing to overlook the non refilled drinks and sub-par food. Until both the bartender and our molasses waiter left the door to the smoking patio open. For 15 minutes. With a smoker seated less than 8 feet of the door. We tried several times to flag down someone to close the door but to no avail. I finally had to follow my waiter to ask for the check as the smoke was visible throughout the place and DH is allergic to it. The owner was snotty and defensive when I asked for the check. Avoid this place if you want to be treated with any respect. I wanted Mad Chef to be \"our hangout\". I'm so sorry that our experience was the antithesis of my wishes."}
{"text":"Great Shepard's Pie, good selection of beer, and attentive staff on a slow Monday afternoon.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of potential at Mad Chef.  I want to like it, I really do. My first impression wasn't that great, but I'm hoping it will get better. At the end of the meal, the server was very sincere in asking for our opinion and mentioned that she was going to let the chef know as it wasn't the first time she heard our feedback.  Lots of great beers on tap (Guinness, Smithwicks, FP Hop Knot), in a bottle (Hoegaarden), and in a can (PBR).  The boy got the burger and I got the grilled veggie sandwich.   On the specials board they had listed \"Salt and Pepper Dry Rib Bits.\"  Sounded interesting and I love pepper, so why not give it a try.  She did warn us that some people had said \"Wow!  That's very peppery.\"  I went for it anyway.  Also, she gave me the happy hour price ($5) even though happy hour didn't start for another hour.  Very nice!  When the food came out, the sandwich was huge and looked delicious.  A pile of great veggies and another pile of fries.  When we started eating, there was a lot of oil was dripping off the grilled veggie sandwich and was so much bread that it overpowered the fresh veggies. Bummer.  Also, the dry rib bits were in fact a little too peppery and dry.  The fries were ok, could use a little seasoning.  I was rubbing the pepper from the ribs onto my fries to try to balance them out.   I plan to give them a couple of months to work things out and then try again. Keeping my fingers crossed for a great pub in the tuke!"}
{"text":"One Star...just because yelp won't let me leave \"no\" stars.  I pull in to the parking lot and as I'm making my way to the doors, a guy is walking toward me in a hurry, he's in shorts and a little t-shirt, then I realize he has an apron on too. Figured he's getting off work...terrible that that's what he's wearing, but I look passed it and move on.  So I walk in at 8:30pm on a Wednesday and the place is dead...I mean not a single table in the restaurant, one couple at the bar, and another gentleman who is leaving. (Should've been my clue #1)  I order a Jameson 18yr on the rocks w/ a coke neat back. The bartender is trying to push this meatball sub, and he couldn't tell me the sauce, other than it was red, and couldn't even guess what kind of meatballs they were. odd for a \"gastropub\" don't ya think? After looking at the menu for about four minutes, that \"cook\" I passed by in the parking lot, strolled behind the bar with his head down... and heads straight to the back (he must've contracted some allergies outside or something, because he had a bad case of the \"sniffles\"). I see him go the back, and I let the bartender know I'm passing on the food, and will take a Smithwick's and close out. He hands me a check for  TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. $18 for a single (measured) one ounce pour of 18 year. Really?   That place needs someone that knows something about something other than beer. Because their draft lineup is pretty stellar, I won't lie...Heck for all I know, that was there before \"Nu Joysee\" took over that place. (Hey that's where there one star can go...beer, lol)...but I remember the food from last time, and to see that happen in front of me was just revolting. I went to Native, and as I said before...saved some money by doing so.  Gross. Disappointing. Never shall return. Will high recommend to anyone to stay far far away."}
{"text":"Mad Chef is just in a bad location. The food is ok and the whole place is clean.  The service can be a little slow sometimes.People don't seem to notice restaurants at this spot."}
{"text":"It really does amaze me how a struggling (probably) restaurant owner that took his parent's money to open this place is basically turning away repeat and future business over a measly $25.  My parents found this place on Restaurant.com and invited my wife and I to dinner here last night.  Since neither of us exactly live close to this place, it is a very reasonably assumption that none of us would have ever eaten here if it weren't for the Restaurant.com certificate.  Anyway, come the end of the meal, we present the certificate and were told that they don't accept them and that we should have presented the coupon before the meal.  I hardly ever do that because I always forget but what's the worst that can happen, right?  Well the owner spouted off some bullcrap (like we cared) about some lawsuit with Restaurant.com and that they are a scam and basically we are out of luck with the coupon.  After the owner told us that we should read directions before doing something, he offered to give us a dessert which we declined because at this point it wasn't about the 2 bucks we spent on the coupon.  It was about how this idiot wouldn't honor the face value and doesn't want repeat customer and referral business.  However, in the end, he did comp an $8 appetizer.  He also got 4 people who will never go back and hopefully many more who will read Yelp reviews and not waste their time in the first place.  All this over a measly $25 that he could have easily taken off this bill.  Anyway, if you must go here, here are some other details.  Our waitress was very fast and friendly.  When we were about to order our meals she spouted off a list of about 5 or 6 menu items that they no longer make for some reason which I thought was odd.  They do have a pretty good beer selection and some decent flights.  However, our waitress had almost no idea what beer was what when she brought them to our table.  I bet she just guessed and made it up.  Also, don't ask for a sample of the 4 peaks pumpkin porter because you will be denied because, \"all they get is one keg\" as told by our waitress.  The food:  * Calamari - pretty good and not overly fried.  Not not enough to share with 4 people though.  I liked the dipping sauce stuff.  Had some kick. * Wedge Salad - i thought this was excellent.  It is a pretty standard wedge but with sauteed mushrooms added.  It was a very nice touch and I would actually order it again if I were to return. * MC's Burger - this was ok.  Had too much going on I think.  Too many onions, too much sauce, bacon too tough, etc.  The fries were nothing special.  If the owner wasn't such a douche I would consider returning if I were in the area because they do have some interesting menu items that look interesting and I like beer.  However, he was a douche and there are TONS of other places out there just like it.  Perhaps I will return when this place closes and another takes its place in a few months."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch with my girlfriend and it was great! The decor is a little plain but very nice looking, the rich wood everywhere adds a lot to the atmosphere. Everyone we spoke to was friendly and the service was decent. They have lots of good beers on tap which you can't always find.  The food was the best part, I had the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend had the meatloaf and it was nothing short of amazing. There's no doubt about it - I'll be coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Happy Hour. Great appetizers for a good price. Try the mini sandwiches; they're small, but big on flavor. The fries with gravy are mighty delicious too *drool*. They have Guinness on tap...if that's as important to you as it is me. Lastly, the MC's Burger is just...it's just...daaaaaayum!! Yep, that good. One of my favorite burgers in the entire valley."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place but was really disappointed. The place had 6 other patrons besides us and the service was really bad. We cleaned off our own table, went to the bar to pick up our own drinks and the only time we received attention was when our waitress was watching us sign our credit card receipt.  The food was ok. Our pita chips were slightly burnt and the dry rub ribs were like the name suggests, very dry."}
{"text":"Food here was very good and the $2 beers were appreciated.  We had the Smorgasbord-very good and the ribs-awesome. Don't change a thing on the ribs or slaw they were both perfect!  Lots of lamb on the menu along with some other great pub grub like meatloaf, bangers/mash & fish & chips.   If I were to nit-pick I'd tell the owner to turn the air up. It was hot almost stifling in the bar area. Also dress up your English chips.  We'll be back to the new, one and only English Pub this side of the freeway."}
{"text":"We went here the other day for lunch and this place was absolutely dead. I've never been to a gastropub before so we were interested in seeing exactly what it was about. We ordered drinks and they passed off something that couldn't even pretend to be a strawberry daquiri..it was a soupy mess with ice chunks in it.   We ordered our food, I had the ribs and my boyfriend had the burger..we were both dissappointed. His burger had arugula and gruyere on it which is new to him, but it was also very overcooked. My ribs were also overcooked and i needed to smother them in BBQ sauce just to make them taste good. The fries were really great and the waitress was really friendly and nice, but I'm not sure we will be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, so pleased on everything. My new favorite dinner spot!"}
{"text":"The bar had a great atmosphere and I really enjoyed the food. I would recommend Gastropub to any friend or relative that is looking for a good time. I tried the Italian sausage sliders and they were amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for just a casual night out to celebrate a year and a half together. We are both beer lovers so we were excited at the prospect of over 20 draught beers. We were a little disappointed after the promise of a focus on microbrews, we were hoping to see some new ones, and getting Stella Artois and Guinness on draught. Not really what I would consider unique microbrews. Sure, Dogfish Head might have been new and exciting 7 years ago, and not that there's anything wrong with it, but I think any casual beer enthusiast has heard of it, and had it by now. That being said, it was nice to have a place offering more than just Bud Light and Miller Lite.  Moving on, the decor was nice, what you would expect for a pub. It seemed to be pretty clean. The silverware was clean, that's one of my big tests for restaurants. We arrived during happy hour, for which they have some pretty good specials. We both had the soup of the day which was French Onion. It was pretty good. A little on the peppery side and the bread was like a scali bread, a sesame seeded white bread, which was a little weird, but overall the flavor was good. For dinner he had their burger, which he said was good, especially the sauce on the bacon. I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich. The pork itself was quite good. The bread kind of looked like it was the last one in the bag. It was a bit mangled and maybe a bit chewy. It was also.....heavily toasted....very heavily toasted. I almost would have preferred just to just eat the meat plain. The fries were very similar to Red Robin and they were hot and crispy. Finally, our server was decent, prompt and there when we needed her, nothing outstanding, nothing terrible.  We decided we'd probably go again and maybe catch a Cardinals game, try out some of their sliders and enjoy a beer. The food was not as imaginitive as we'd hoped for a gastropub, and the beer selection was not as extensive, but overall, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that since I was last there the gravy fries have changed, in name and in quality.  They no longer use a good quality aged cheddar cheese and now they put \"curds\" on them.  Yuck.  The pastrami on the Rueben was so salty I could not eat the sandwich.  I might try it again to find some value in this place, I really do want to like it."}
{"text":"Purchased a coupon for Mad Chef on Restaurant.com. Showed up there tonight and was informed that they would not accept the coupon because they were not participating in the \"deal\" that was offered (then why are you listed on their site?). I asked if they were refunding the purchase price and the woman (I'm guessing one of the owners) said, and I quote, \"What??? Your 2 dollars?\" And that was it. Really? you're going to be that rude and call me out? The dollar amount wasn't important to me. The fact that I had to waste my time going down there to find out they wouldn't honor it and then be treated rudely was the issue. So instead of honoring the coupon and possibly gaining a pair of regular customers for the duration that their business is open, which, if their hospitality is any gauge...won't be long, she decides to be rude and run us off.  GREAT business practice lady!!!  I give you couple more months just like every other business that goes into that location. Now off to Twitter and Facebook to spread the word about this wonderfully rude establishment. Oh, and they got 1 star because I couldn't give less. Have a nice day!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to getting some upscale food at a real gastro pub here in Phoenix but alas was sadly disappointed.  This place gives the word Gastro Pub a bad name.  The food was slightly overpriced for bar food, which it essentially was. The wife had the salmon that was overcooked. I opted for a burger and would have been just as happy going to in n out down the street.  They did have a large tap list, about 30 beers on tap but half of them were garbage beers, they were really trying to push PBR when we were there. C'mon- PBR in what is supposed to be an upscale pub!!! Whomever owns this place needs to get a clue."}
{"text":"Great beer selection  Food is good. MC's burger had plenty of flavor. Dressing was heavy on spinach salad."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The service was crap and the food was only okay. There was a big group of us, so that may have thrown them off, but it's not like the place was packed. I don't think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"I think this place really does itself a disservice by using the \"gastropub\" name.  It is a bar, there is no doubt about that.  20 draft beers? check.  Green awning outside? check. Slow service? check.  So they have all of the things that make them the fulfill the \"pub\" part of the name.    The problems start coming in the \"gastro\" part.  I was expecting some interesting, adventurous twists on pub food.  What I saw really wasn't all that interesting.  It was sort of half-assed...just like the decoration of the restaurant part of the building.  It just wasn't much to look at.  So I order the \"bangers and onions\" which was actually an italian-style sausage and peppers sandwich without the peppers.  It was pretty good but wasn't really full of flavor.  They should reconsider the kind of sausage they bring in.  Something spicier or sweeter would be better.  The waitress was nice enough and the main dining room had the Mariners on so I couldn't complain about that.  I just was expecting more of a culinary experience and what I got was on par with just about any restaurant in the valley.  Opportunity missed.  Maybe they need a new chef."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. Been there twice now. Only had beers the first time. Ordered a few of the happy hour sliders the second time. Bbq pork really good. Brisket was good but a little chewey, italian beef was dry. Not bad for $2 though. Good beer selection, sat in the bar and had excellent service both times. Will go back. Would like to try some more of their food. The bar seating makes you feel like a little kid, too high."}
{"text":"I can't really say that this place was all that great.  It wasn't bad by any means though, so that's good.  I guess I don't really understand why they use the term gastropub, because I didn't really see any focus on gourmet cuisine.  That being said, the food was average, with room for improvement.  I ordered the meatloaf and it had a nice tomato type gravy served over the top of it.  It was wayyyyy too much food though.  They should definitely cut back on that.  I liked it, but it wasn't anything that wowed me.  The restaurant itself needs to dirty itself up a bit, maybe darken up, or something to get my mind in the \"gastropub\" feeling.  It really just looks like a repurposed Italian restaurant, complete with faux painted walls.  I agree with Stacy that Mad Chef has lots of potential.  I hope they come to realize it because they could be a great success."}
