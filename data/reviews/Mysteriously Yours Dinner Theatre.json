{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last 8 years and each time it's a great experience. 
For the price, you get a 3 course meal and an entertaining and interactive show. It's wonderful as a first date, to help break the ice, or for a night with the kids or with your friends just to get the night started. I am definitely a fan and I don't know how anyone can complain about this place, but to each their own."}
{"text":"The show itself is great - interactive with the audience, clever jokes, new themes every week that cater to popular culture - entertaining enough for a night out! 

Where this dinner theatre loses marks are for quality of food and service. The food is mediocre, comparable to tv dinners or airplane food, but edible at least. Salad, soup and dessert were good which is less than I could say for the Fried Chicken entree I ordered (not crispy at all, more like a soggy breaded cutlet)

Our waiter seemed lost in outer space, unable to remember the specials, spilling drinks on one of our party and almost coming close to dropping the dessert on me!! Had to ask too many times for water/bread (which was stale)... Not very attentive at all. 

Overall, I would still recommend this place on the sole reason of the entertainment. Although the jokes were a little corny at times, they at least tried to cater to all ages. Charming storyline, something new to experience."}
{"text":"I went to Mysteriously Yours with family over the Holidays.  The show was fun, but the food and service were lacking.

When we arrive we found there was a mandatory coat check for $2.  Why not just incorporate this into the dinner/show fee?  Especially in the winter when everyone will have a coat?  Or else allow guests to keep their coats.  I found this practice insulting!

We sat down and were greeted by our server promptly.  Before the prix-fixe meal we ordered the chef's special appetizer (shrimp skewers) which took a long time and came out cold.  Wine was $36 for a bottle that would have been  ~$13 at the LCBO.  I ordered an single glass of red wine for $11 (not the house wine) and it tasted like vinegar (probably from a day-old bottle). The server never asked me how the wine was, and so I didn't complain.

The food was okay.  The salad was standard, I enjoyed my braised beef ribs, and the bread pudding was good too.  However---upon arriving home, about 3 hours after my meal I became violently ill for the next 8-10 hours.  Thanks Mysteriously Yours for the food poisoning.

While I enjoyed the show (actors were generally good), it relied heavily on dirty jokes.  When I encounter this in any comedy I always feel it is a crutch for bad scriptwriting.  Good scripts are funny without relying massively on sexual innuendo.  In fact I can't remember any non-sexual jokes.  Moving on...  

Finally, at the end we were asked to fill out a card where we guess whodunnit.  These cards were then later used in a raffle for free mementos (t-shirts, etc.).  However, the staff forgot to collect our cards, so we were not included.  When we brought this to their attention we got a quick shrug and a \"sorry\" but nothing more.  I got the impression that management is not greatly concerned about correcting or improving customer experience.

In summary while I enjoyed the show, I felt it was expensive for what we got.  Top that off with hidden fees, poor customer service, and food poisoning, and I probably won't be coming back or recommending this to any friends."}
{"text":"Fabulous and memorable night with co-workers. I was a bit dubious after reading the reviews but I must admit that the food was really good and I'm a food snob. The corn chowder was excellent and the beef with smashed potatoes succulent and tender.The actors were fab and I was quite taken that they were able to stay in character while having to deal with a diversity of patrons. Quick and clever on their feet was the charm. Hooray for this wonderful gem of a hidden theatre. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't come here.

First let me tell you that I had good food and a good time...except for one thing that ruined my whole night. Actor and asshat extraordinaire Ken Mcdougal. He played a mock Donald trump to a tee cuz he was an asshole. 
He singled me out and repeatedly harassed me during THE ENTIRE FUCKING SHOW. 
Now let's be clear, I don't mind being included at all, I also don't mind being laughed at or made fun of as long as it's in fun and not malicious. 
But there's a limit to how much myself and anyone will put up with. 
This guys particular brand of bullshit became old after he did it for the 10th time....and kept doing it for 3 HOURS. I even went up and told him he took it way too far and he gave zero fucks. 

So no...I don't recommend coming here, I do t recommend brining Yur friends and family. 
I'll certainly never be back. 

Share this far and wide."}
{"text":"It my first time going to mysteriously yours and a dinner comedy show so I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Overall I think this was a great experience and definitely worth trying at least once. The details...dinner was like some others say average. Nothing too special. I got a leek potato spinach soup which I've made at home so not like I can't get it. The salmon was made perfectly,  nice and flaky and a good size too. The dessert was a brownie with whipped cream. Now if the brownie came warm with a side of icecream that would've been awesome. Since it didn't then nothing to rave about. So food was ok. Now the show, it was very entertaining. The actors did a very good job working the crowd. It was interactive and they moved everywhere in the room so there's really no bad seat from what I can see. The theme was spy school and being someone that loves spy movies it was great as I can relate and laugh at some of the references. So I think it depends on what the theme is too. If its a theme that you don't know much about then I can see it not being as enjoyable. So choose wisely. Perhaps if its your first time maybe you'd want to try both dinner and show to get the full experience. But in retrospect dinner was nothing too special so next time I'd probably skip that and just go for the show."}
{"text":"Always fun and always funny. I have seen three shows: \"Tangled Web\", \"Murder at Twilight\", and \"Apprentice to Murder\". Murder at Twilight, which is inspired by current vampire movies and TV series \"True Blood\" is my favourite, but it might not be as good if you're not familiar with the TV show. I've only been to the Yonge Street location where I had the prix fixe menu, and found the food to be good and plentiful. I can't comment on the Old Mill location as the menu is different there."}
{"text":"Went there for my husband's Christmas dinner. Really enjoyed it as it was different experience where you get to participate in solving the mystery. All the characters were very nice and We were all laughing and the food I had was the ribs and I really liked it. It was fun and would go back again just for the fun of it."}
{"text":"I have been to this dinner theatre many times and it never disappoints.  The entire staff is friendly and kind, making sure everything goes smoothly.  The food was great.  I started with the soup - it was delectable.  I then had a perfectly cooked chicken breast with crispy geen beans and mashed potatoes.  Dessert was a decadent brownie.  All served with a genuine smile from my server.

The show was great.  I especially liked Lady Edith who flirted shamelessly with my boyfriend.  

I will continue to go to Mysteriouly Yours.  It is one fun evening."}
{"text":"This was something I'd never purchase for myself and assumed was tacky or not quite my humour. My husband and I are kind of douchebags when it comes to comedy so we were surprised that the show was really quite funny and engaging throughout. Audience involvement was well done (not embarrassing) and there was a good degree of quality improv. 

We enjoyed the dinner and show with another couple. I ordered the Baked Potato Soup, Salmon with mashed potatoes and Pineapple Custard for dessert. I loved all my dishes but there were some mixed feelings at our table. Others ordered the salad (pretty standard), chicken (reported dry) and Nutella brownie (\"not Nutella enough\"). 

I received a gift certificate for my birthday and an extra $20 off through workperks. Regardless, still great value especially if you're celebrating a special occasion. Definitely something to try."}
{"text":"I went to Mysteriously Yours with some friends. Overall, it was a fairly enjoyable experience, but I found the food to be pretty disappointing. The actors and the play itself were cheesy (but that was expected) and all had a good attitude and had the audience laughing often. They had mandatory coat check which wasn't the greatest as there was a line up to check and then again at the end of the night to retrieve your jacket. I bought a groupon for this place, and when we arrived, I was told I was required to pay $10 per person for 'fees and tips' before entrance. I found this odd, and we should be able to tip based on the service. We bought two of their Mojitos and they were probably the worst mojitos I've ever had. There was pretty much no lime in them and they didn't taste fresh. All in all, I thought the show was cute, but the point was to go for a show and a nice dinner and the nice dinner never arrived. I wouldn't go back here even at groupon prices. But if you don't care too much about the food, it's still an entertaining evening for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for the show only - what a fun night! 

Show is incredibly interactive, the actors will come around pre-show and chat with you, and may incorporate you in the show by giving you a line or two. Production is fairly small and has only a handful of actors, but is very entertaining to watch and be a part of! 

The plot will change from time to time so you can certainly come back for more. There's very limited time to order food/drinks (only before the show and when they take a break). 

Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and every time is an enjoyable evening. The food looks good and has great texture. (My sense of smell is impaired, so I can't speak either way to the flavours, but that texture of the crust on the salmon. MMMMMMM!)

The actors are professional and highly entertaining. It's great to have them interacting with everyone and try to include all the birthday boys and girls in the audience (so-long as they're notified ahead of time that it's someone's birthday). It seems they try to make every effort to include everyone (or at least every table) in the place, and that just makes it so much more fun for everyone.

I said the actors are professional, and I mean it. Excellent improvisational skills, even working off each other's flubs when they happen so it all feels like it's part of the script. I also enjoyed the component of the show that had me watching people's behaviour and what they said, taking notes, and then casting a vote for who I thought \"dunnit\".

If I was to nit pick, there is something about this venue that feels dated. Maybe it's the carpet or walls, but they just feel like they could do with a change.

If I have someone I want to show a good time and entertain, I'll definitely come here. Will return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a dinner theatre, and it was surprisingly good.

Pros:
-Plot was entertaining
-Audience participation was light, and not embarrassing
-Great for family or group gatherings

Cons:
-Food was OK, nothing special

Make sure to look for discount tickets!"}
{"text":"I visited this place a couple of weeks ago and it's still on my mind.  Anyone who has an appreciation for theatre and comedy would definitely get a kick out of this place! It's truly a unique experience. The servers are all very kind and charismatic the drinks are creative and delicious, and the atmosphere was a mix between light-hearted and suspenseful.  Perfect for a mystery show!  

The show was both charming and hilarious. The actors were animated and fit their characters well. The show really succeeded in making you think, given the intricate but not overly complicated plot.   The audience-actor interaction adds a great touch.   I also had the pleasure of meeting some of the actors after the show - they are all extremely friendly and welcoming.  

I didn't manage to win a prize by the end of the show (I didn't guess whodunnit correctly)  but there are prizes to be won for those who do so be observant!  

Great place for a date too! The show provides a lot of material to talk about if you get stuck in an awkward silence (Intermission is a great time to discuss clues/hints).

Glad to finally see something different in Toronto.  I will most certainly be returning for the next show!"}
{"text":"I came here with a date and we had a really good time. The show was run extremely well from beginning to end. At the beginning of the night the actors walk around the audience and mingle with each table. They then ask different people if they will be willing to participate in the show. The guy I was with was asked if he would sing a line and other people learned choreographed dances and such.

All of the actors were great! At the end of the night, you are asked to cast your vote on how the crime was committed, who did it, the weapon used and so forth. People who answered correctly were entered into a draw to win fun prizes.

It was a great experience and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I just had so much fun! I've done everything there is to do in Toronto. This was on the list, and it was a great. The actors were great. The food was way better than expected, and the evening was splendid!"}
{"text":"We loved the show. Great actors. Great plot. Lots of comedic lines. The food SO much better than expected. It was very good. My son John whom we call Jay won a prize for guessing whodunnit. Because we live out of town, he gave the tickets he won to a local - Billy, the stunt double. It was loads of fun. 
Only challenge is the stairs for ability-challenged mom (aka me). Would DEFINITELY recommend to friends."}
{"text":"As long as you're ready to enjoy some cheesiness, you will enjoy yourself. Don't be expecting to see a Broadway play or dine in a 5-star restaurant, but for what it is, a night out on the town, Mysteriously Yours is fine.....maybe a little expensive"}
{"text":"I had a really good job time. The food was good and the show was funny. I would recommend this place for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon..overall just an OK experience... Personally prefer Second city a little bit more. Food is average. Waiter didn't pay much attention to us. Actors are very friendly though:)."}
{"text":"Before basing your decision on whether to go or not on this review first please understand that the SHOW is great. If you go I suggest eating before and just going to the show. I've been three times and this last experience the meal was awful. 
Ceasar salad was mixed green (your lawn) leafs with tomatoes. (In what world is that a ceasar salad?) and the beef brisket was shaved wet meat mixed with rice mushrooms and onions. It looked and tasted like pig slop. That mixed with the fact that it was a miracle if the waiter ever happened to walk by and getting water was difficult. Horrible dining experience. 
That being said the show is fun and highly recommended. If I go back I would eat before and arrive at 8 to enjoy the show."}
{"text":"I went here for my hubby's birthday with his family a while back.  We purchased some Teambuy tickets for the dinner and show.  The place is sizable but nothing fancy.  The show was mediocre with some good laughs here and there.  I liked how they encourage the audience to participate but I definitely think it could have been better executed.  The chicken entree was quite good but the beef entree was not so good.  In the end, I still felt a bit hungry even though I'm not a big eater.  I feel like I would have been pretty disappointed if I paid full price for the dinner and show.  But we didn't and we still had a good time overall since our expectations weren't very high to begin with."}
{"text":"It is expensive for sure. And I won't say that it was extremely funny. Average jokes, average food. But it is a nice place to come with your girlfriend or family.
So bad there is not much competition."}
{"text":"This is a unique evening out... Yes the mandatory coat check is a buzzkill, but other than that, the evening was fun.  The show is cheesy, the jokes are one smutty pun after another ... that's what it is. 
I enjoyed reading that the owners are spouses and write all the shows themsleves and act in them - talent!

The food was very good, I'm surprised to read what other r's have to say below... Great homemade soup, beef ribs and authentic mashed taters, really nice dessert. Portions were a little modest but there's a bread basket.  

BUT the drinks. We ordered doubles for our $9.00 cocktails and they charged $19.00 per drink... I felt just a tiny bit jacked."}
{"text":"Great show but terrible food and cocktails. 
The actors were very entertaining and funny, I really liked that they included the audience and improvised with their jokes. We had lots of fun trying to solve the mystery. 
The food was mediocre, I think the produce wasn't very fresh and everything tasted bland. 
Cocktails didn't taste good either and we had to send them back. 
I'm giving 1 star to the chef and the bartender as I believe that I can cook much better tasting food at home. Five stars to the actors as they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I got an invite to this theatre and was pretty excited to go, I mean it's like clue... In real life!

The first thing I did when I went inside was check in. After finding the place on my phone, I saw the previous reviews and it wasn't exactly too too amazing (meh). I decided to wait to pass judgement. 

The dinner/show is set up in the following fashion. Appetizers followed by the entree followed by first half of the show, desert and the the second half and then the finale. 

The food itself is pretty bad. I mean it does come in nice plates and it's plated nice, but that doesn't make up for the quality of food. I found it pretty generic and not too special. I think the best analogy about how the food was is the food your friend that thinks he's a good cook makes... Whos food is actually not great at all. 

Now I don't really think it's too fair to judge a dinner theatre based on food alone.  So I'll talk a little about the show itself. 

The show itself is pretty cool because it's not really a show that's separated from the audience. What I mean is that the actors perform in the dining room around everyone and mingle with the audience. 

Now I can't really say that much about the other shows but I can definitely say that the script wasn't that complicated.  I guess you can say that it needs to be for people to figure it out. 

So I guess it was kind of an overall experience to be judged. A thing I did like was that everything dinner, taxes, and gratuity was all include at the beginning. It kinda made it feel like an all inclusive deally.  Saying that, alcohol is extra, and it's really pricey. It's about 6.75 for a bottle of sleemans or keiths. Brutal. I figure that's how they make most of their money. 

I think it would really depend on the actual show that you're in, as the shows are always changing. Mine was alright, but I think there could have been some potential in other shows."}
{"text":"Tucked away between Yonge and Davisville, one would not notice this quaint establishment that boldly combines dinner, theatre, and interactive mystery solving with the audience at first glance.

Initially thought this concept sounded tacky since I've never experienced one, but was quickly proven wrong after a fun filled night with fellow colleagues.

The evening began with actors coming around each table conversing with you whilst in character. A piece of paper and small pencils were provided for you to write down clues. As they came around, they would reveal bits and pieces of information about themselves and other characters according to the script. However, found it quite perplexing since there seemed to be much red herring in the information they release to you. Be sharp and witty for it may help you catch the murderer. 

Dinner started off with kale salad which was nothing too mention worthy; was just ok. On the other hand, the salmon with dill sauce on couscous exploded with flavours and left a fragrant aroma of herbs inside your mouth after the first bite. Was very pleasantly surprised the salmon turned out better than expected. The only drawback was that it was overcooked by a little bit, but nonetheless was still good. For dessert, a simple nutella cheesecake in a cup was served. You can taste a rich decadent layer of nutella and well balanced amount of cream cheese on a base of crunchy oreo cookies. Only took the first couple of bites as it was quite sweet and nothing too extraordinary about this one.

Towards the end of the show, the suspense would grow as the audience try hard to figure out who murdered X. You would receive a piece of paper and write down your answer and justify why. One would say it was similar to playing Clue, only in live action.

Had an awesome experience as part of our company work event overall. Found the actors professional and fun to interactive with. Food was alright but was definitely the experience that made it enjoyable. As the show's original price would probably be around ~$80+, would recommend it at a more discounted price. $80+ is too steep."}
{"text":"Mysteriously Yours provides you with an unforgettable novelty experience that you won't find anywhere else in the city. It's a setting where you will have to get into with an open mind (and a couple of drinks) to really appreciate how much fun it really is.  The food is not fantastic but the overall experience is really worth it. The show/ actors are so much fun and really engages the audience (but not in an intimidating manner).  The actors are so quick on their feet and you can't help but admire that.  If you want to have a memorable date - come here."}
{"text":"Love it here! Food isn't spectacular but we didn't expect 5star either. Portions could be bigger but guess we all could serve to eat less sometimes. Shows are up to the times & make great pop culture references,  which is always FUN.  We used deal tickets from deal sites to visit,  as they run frequently, & it was all def worth more than paying half price!  These days u cant eat out at a nice place for cheaper than $50 & here we get a funny show included!  Invited friends to join us for our 2nd visit & they loved it too! Taking more friends this weekend - some who've been & some new:-)"}
{"text":"Excellent for the show and experience, however, food was sub-par. I saw a picture of pink chicken on here, but decided to go for chicken anyways (big mistake). My chicken was pink! I didn't realize right away as it was only the part under the skin. Not sure how that's even possible. The desserts looked strange and were just okay. Salad was decent, but everyone else at my table said it tasted off and didn't eat it. Definitely time for a menu change."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!!!!

I've been to a few dinner theatres before and they were fun.  This one is not.  A friend took another friend and I there as birthday gifts for us both.  If it hadn't been for not wanting him to feel worse then he already did about the fiasco, I think I would have stood up in the middle of it and made a huge scene, demanding management come out onto the floor and everyone in the room to get their money back.  Dramatic I know, but I hope I never encounter such bullsh*t as this again.

Service:  Without any exaggeration we waited 1 hr and 50 min for the 1st course of soup and salad.  We managed to literally grab the arm of a bus boy who had been doing his best to wander around doing nothing while avoiding eye contact for bread and drinks.  The waitress handling our area would appear every 15-20 min, take orders from part of a table and then disappear again.  At one point she spilled soup down the wall by a neighboring table and never returned to clean it up.  It stayed on the wall for about 20 min when another bus person saw it and was visibly shocked and went to get towels to clean it up.  She obviously never bothered to even tell anyone it had happened.

Food:  Some people at our table had the prix fix menu and others ordered from the regular menu.  It was all bad (see other reviewer).  What does $25 get you on the price fix menu?  For one of my friends it got him salad which he only ate a few bites of because it was so bland.  His ribs and pasta main course consisted of 2 short ribs and macaroni.  Not 2 stacks of ribs like you might be thinking, but 2 ribs, 1, 2, a rack must have been divided amongst 3 table.  No point even bothering with the other plates descriptions, they were equally pathetic.  Thank god for that bread basket we finally got...the small dinner rolls you buy bulk in any grocery stores,...unheated....no butter, yup nothing like dry white bread to tide you over for that 1 hr and 50 min until you get the meal you can't believe you actually paid for.

Show:  Pity you if you were expecting a show, one in which might redeem having wasted $35 on food and drinks, knowing you are going to have to go get supper somewhere else because you are now starving and pissed.  There was a stage, but maybe its just used for wait staff to hide behind.  I don't know, it wasn't used for the show, so it must have some purpose.  6 Actors sat and mingled amongst the guests.  They were good enough actors and I give them credit for maintaining their characters when trying to interact with people.  Table after table were asking for food and service of the actors.

And the evening dragged on.  I went to the kitchen and attempted to get our bill so we could get out of there.  I stood there for 15 min watching staff just stand around in the kitchen as they started to process bills fr 250+ people on one interac machine.  I finally gave up and about another 15 min later we managed to find our waitress to give her cash and get out of there.

It's quite a scam.  250+ people paying $36.75 for the show or $53 for dinner and the show (most people there last night were for both), so $13000 nightly take + drinks for actors dressed in value village attire to interact with you a bit, and macaroni.  Yup, thank you to the management of Mysteriously Yours for ruining a generous gift from amazing friends.  Shame on you!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Friday night. We purchased tickets in advance over the phone since we found a discount and were not able to apply on the site. At first we only purchased tickets for the show and not dinner. 

On the day of the show, we arrived at the theatre at around 6:30 and decided last minute to eat dinner there as well. It was a good idea since we were able to get the full experience. 

The interior of the theatre was very interesting, red and gold seemed to be the colour scheme and rather old looking. 

Our waiter came to our table but didn't greet us or say anything (at first I thought it was all an act and that he was part of the show idk) anyways it turned out he wasn't...not sure what his deal was. I had to ask for water twice before getting it too. Maybe he was having a rough day, who knows. 

The menu is a 3 course meal, I ordered the garden salad, braised beef and s'mores. Overall the food was meh! That's all I have to say about it, it wasn't the greatest but it wasn't the worst either. 

The show however was AWESOME! I enjoyed every minute of it, the actors were great in terms of acting and really got the audience involved. I love the interaction between the Audience and the cast members. 

Some of the jokes were a bit cheesy and corny but I still had a great laugh here and there. 

I would definitely go back for another round on guessing the killer."}
{"text":"$30 or so for the dinner
$50 or so for the show
$80 or so for both. 

the dinner was not too bad but i wouldn't say it's worth $30-35 normally. I think $20-25 would be a fair price. The show, is worth the $50 though. It was fun, interactive and entertaining. They make full use of the dining area and if you booked a reservation to celebrate something there, they will include you in part of the act.

going back to the food, i had the salad, which like usual, i'd say is pretty hard to mess up.
provencale beef stew was quite good. very flavourful and was more filling than it looked.
the tiramisu was not too bad. but i would've preferred more of the lady fingers in mine.
for a drink i ordered the norman's psycho-delic punch. it was very fruity which i actually like. i barely tasted any alcohol in it which i like as well but also did not feel any effects of the alcohol at all either. that was $5+ taxes. 

would i come again? it'd have to be for a special occasion.

UPDATE: Norman's Psycho-Delic Punch is NOT an alcoholic beverage. Duh. Now who's psycho? Yep, me."}
{"text":"We came here for a work event and had a great time. It's a little difficult to find the place since the entry is smaller than other stores in the area. However, the inside of the dinner theater is quite large, with room for 20+ tables of 6-8. It may be difficult to find parking in the area, so I recommend using Google Street View ahead of time.

Coat check is required, but it's complimentary. It becomes a bottleneck at the start of service and at the end of the show. Once we found a place to sit, it took some time to get drinks or food ordered. There were some drinks that were listed under alcoholic and non-alcoholic, but the waitress didn't ask to clarify which one we wanted. The food was good. I'm not sure why there were so many complaints in the past. We had the sweet potato soup, which was spicy, but delicious. The baked tilapia and beef stew were also tasty. The tiramisu was decent, though not what I expected from a traditional tiramisu.

We saw the \"Getting Hitched!\" show, which I thought was a lot of fun! The actors and actresses played their part and included audience members into the show. They were quick on their feet to answer our questions during the start of the show and during brief intermissions where we were encouraged to ask questions to help catch the murderer.

Overall, I highly recommend Mysteriously Yours for work functions. It seemed like everyone had a great time being entertained by the actors and actresses, the food and drinks were tasty, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. The theater is located in the basement. My hubby and I had dinner and a show with another lovely couple. We didn't expect much from the murder mystery show; and it was better than we expected. 

Ticket for dinner and show is $87 including taxes and gratuity. You can often find coupon code online for $10-20 off which makes it a very decent deal. 

Dinner starts around 6-630pm, three course dinner: 
1) soup or salad. Soup of the day is \"loaded baked potato with bacon bits\"; it was a creamy potato soup. I liked it. A friend had salad, it was okay. 

2) entree (choices include chicken, salmon, beef stew, or vegetarian). 
I had chicken with cream sauce, served with rice, roasted vegetables, and roasted cherry tomatoes. This was okay; chicken was dry IMO.
My hubby had the salmon with mashed potato and roasted carrots. Mash was creamy and tasty; salmon wasn't too fresh, a bit too fishy. 

3) dessert (choice of nutella brownie or butterscotch custard).
Brownie was just okay. I was disappointed because I couldn't taste any nutella. 
Butterscotch custard is a better option IMO.
Dinner also comes with either tea or coffee. 

Alcohol is extra and its reasonably priced. 

The show was quite entertaining. The actors and actresses tried to engage the audience as much as possible which was nice. 
The theme of the evening was Aquatic Spy School (ASS, lol which was funny). Mission Ridiculous! 
It was silly but funny. 

Overall, it was a fun evening for us. Food was OK, show was entertaining."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5...gave it a 4 to boost up the past poor reviews.

After reading the terrible reviews that other Yelpers have written I went to Mysteriously Yours with the lowest expectations that one can expect. Parking is a bit difficult to find on a Friday night so I had to park in the residential area which is about a 5-10 minute walk but I jogged so I got there in no time.

The dinner/show is quite expensive I must say. It will cost you pretty much $80 for a three course meal and a show. The dining/show area felt quite homey, warm, and had the holiday feeling. I was there with 14 other friends for my friend's birthday and we got served by the servers pretty fast. I literally had a few minutes to look over the menu as soon as I sat down until someone took my order. 

Apparently the food is supposed to be REALLY bad here but I was surprisingly impressed. The food came out fast and hot. I ordered their salad (which was not bland and had enough dressing), chicken with pasta (refer to picture), and the chef's dessert special (a tiramisu mousse). The food did not taste like it was from a can and was prepared nicely. I guess the quality of food depends on whose working that night.

The show started at 8 pm and was about 2 hours with intermissions in between. The actors/actresses would come around and mingle with guests (in character, of course). The act had MANY dirty innuendos...at first I thought I was just dirty minded but it was actually dirty lol. At the end of the show you write down who you think was murdered and if your answer is correct and gets chosen, you win a gift bag from them with Mysteriously Yours souvenir.

Overall, it was good but I wouldn't want to pay $80 for it...maybe $60."}
