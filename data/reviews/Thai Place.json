{"text":"AMAZING food, paired with EXCEPTIONAL service!!! I can't say enough about how kind, courteous, helpful and friendly the staff is here- it's surreal.   The Tom Yum soup is the best I've ever had, not to mention all the other food we tried! Top notch quality, and unbelievable service- we will be back this week (and it's Saturday)! A++++++"}
{"text":"Takeout review only.   The restaurant looked very clean and well put together, low lighting, quiet, gentle colors. The service was very good - I called and ordered a takeout entree to be ready at 6 and saw the cook walk it to the front at 5:59. I appreciate picking up hot takeout.  I just can't get past the food. If you are really desperate for Thai and don't want to leave Wexford then this is your place. I ordered the Spicy Rice Noodles because I wanted noodles and I like Pad Thai but find it too sweet for me. The veggies were good - broccoli, carrots, cabbage, water chestnuts, the tofu was full of grease, the noodles were nice - flatter and wider than typical rice noodles. The sauce though I tasted fish sauce was more like Chinese garlic sauce than a thai sauce to me. It was very greasy and I would have preferred half of the sauce.  This matches my past experiences with takeout from here - mostly one note flavors (not the mouth bursting many flavors that I love about Thai food) and a nice dose of spice."}
{"text":"Greasy noodles with about a tenth the flavor one should expect from Thai cuisine. Not to mention the incredibly inept waitress.  Never again."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal here on a Monday evening. Service was quick and pleasant, and the food was great. Atmosphere could use a bit of warmth, but other than that we had an awesome meal. Would highly recommend in this area!"}
{"text":"Good food. Very slow service. When I called they asked to make reservations as they expected it to be busy night."}
{"text":"They are not authentic the seafood is NOT fresh. It is way overly priced like freaking ridiculous for the quality and verity. I got the tom yum soup and the fish actually tasted moldy the two times I got it. The portions are small. Atmosphere is nice but that is as far as I am going to go when it comes to complements. The waiters look to be 18. My soup bowl was sticky. This place is not worth it. Sorry for the negativity it's sad that Pittsburgh gets so ripped when it comes to true Thai food."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Thai food I have ever had in my life. The pad Thai smelled like dog food. The yellow curry was so watered down and bland. The service was absolutely terrible and they argued with us about the bill when we didn't like or eat our food. The tea tastes old and spoiled. Nobody should have to pay for bad service, bad food and terrible service on food they didn't eat"}
{"text":"Great casual Thai place.  Girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner and were pleasantly surprised with the food, service and overall experience.  The food was fresh and tasted great.  I ordered the beef satay and she had the spicy shrimp coconut soup.  The satay was good to go and the soup had excellent flavor.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly.  The server was very nice and attentive.  I would go again and they get a thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Great customer service and very healthy and FRESH tasting food. Had garlic chicken and pad Thai. It is a family owned business and I love to support small businesses: come to find out this place has been around 10-15 years. I would certainly come again as I was impressed with the high quality taste of both my entrees. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed to only be able to give this restaurant 3 stars because some colleagues had recommended it to me and I was expecting more. I went here on a Saturday for lunch. It was eerily quiet (which should have been an indicator, I suppose)--only one other table was seated when we got there and two other tables were seated while I was there.  The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. I also thought the decor was cute and it seemed very clean. The food, however, was the disappointing part. Entrees were around $13 each--would have liked a lunch price, and would have expected bigger portions than what we received. Even the rice that came with the curry was the tiniest of portions.   The green curry had good flavor, but was really watery. We got an eggplant dish, and 90% of the eggplant was tough and almost inedible. There were approximately 4 pieces of eggplant that were delicious, which made me think the rest of the dish was leftover from the day before and re-cooked (and over-cooked). The pad see ewe was probably the best of the three dishes we got, but the others were lacking so much and the portions were so small that it was hard to appreciate.  In summary, I thought the portions were too small and the quality of the food inconsistent given the prices. If I lived closer, I'd give it another shot, but unfortunately, there are better Thai places closer my neighborhood, so I likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've had Thai all over the globe.  Thai Place is good but not great in comparison, but as a local restaurant it fulfills the need for Thai!  It is not as authentic as many other Thai restaurants I've been to but the  food is good, it is clean, and the service is attentive."}
{"text":"This got to be the worst Thai food I've eaten. Service is excellent though, but don't know that much English. Tasteless food. Pork ribs with too much fat. Like most of the reviews stated, this place seem more Chinese than Thai. Broccoli chicken seemed microwaved because the broccoli was crunchy and the chicken didn't taste like chicken. The eggrolls tasted like plastic, and the rice was very soggy. I will probably just come back for the Thai Tea and That Iced Coffee."}
{"text":"The food is not bad - but nothing special. The curries, pad thai, and salads are good, but the appetizers are a must skip. One thing to be aware of, the salad does not come with sufficient dressing to cover all of the lettuce. If you ask for more, you will be charged extra ($1). This place is the king of hidden charges and nickel and diming practices."}
{"text":"The satays here are really good. Some of the best I've ever had. Their tofu delight is very delicious."}
{"text":"Lucky i Gave the 1 star  Cant even take down the order right . I will never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Lunch at a bargain price! In this economy who isn't looking to save a buck."}
{"text":"I enjoy good a good pad thai and thought I'd drop by this place since I was in the area and craving thai food. I ordered the chicken pad thai along with some thai iced coffee. The thai coffee had a weird aftertaste that isn't present in the numerous other thai ice coffee I have tried. The chicken in the pad thai was actually the best part of the dish. I'd consider the actual pad thai mediocre at best. I highly doubt I will be coming here again. For what it's worth, I don't think the pad thai was worth the $10 I paid for."}
{"text":"So I'm a vegetarian and I'm always looking to try new places and cuisines. I went here with my brother for the first time after shopping because he loves this place.   I don't really have anything too bad to say but the stuff there wasn't that great. Hot and sour soup here tastes really weird, but they do make it vegetarian which is a plus. I think if you want to be sure of a good meal get pad thai. By the way the spicy levels are 1-10... They seem to have pretty high spiciness even at level 5. First time I went I got a spicy level 2... What can I say, I was afraid! But the next time I got a 5. I would say if I go again I'll get somewhere in between.   It's nice that they have tofu available for vegetarian and vegans. The workers here are always nice and polite and service is pretty fast i suppose but overall this seems like just an average place to get Thai."}
{"text":"This is gourmet crafted Thai food - try the Woon Sen Pad Tai noodles with chicken (spicy set to 8-10 if you like a little fire on your food). My favorite!!  Very nice man that owns store & very good food and staff too"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Food is always wonderful and the service is excellent. My all time favorite is the Pho."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch and the pad thai is excellent! Not a thai food snob but it was good enough to make me want to return. Atmosphere was nice and the service was very good although it was hardly crowded at the time."}
{"text":"We order lunch from here regularly for over a year. It used to be great but the quality is really slipping over the last 6 months. Sometimes it is under cooked, sometimes the food is slimy. Overall it is very inconsistent. We keep ordering from here hoping it will be good again but it isn't... Also, they constantly say the food will be ready in 20 minutes and we have to wait there for an hour."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food nice owners and personable service. The negative reviews are based on petty details. This family has another Thai restaurant on walnut street in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The slowest restaurant service I've ever experienced. It took almost FOUR hours to finish the dinner. The restaurant was half empty when we arrived on a Saturday night at 6:30pm, and it was completely empty when we left after 10pm.  The BAD: - extremely slow service - two waitresses and a manager in the whole restaurant. The manager came several times to apologize for the slow service. It took over 10 min even just to be seated, although the restaurant was half empty. - the fresh spring rolls were not fresh - they were from the fridge - cold and hardened - the plates were very cold and food was only lukewarm - the dishes were undercooked - the squash was not cooked with the curry but was added raw on top of the dish; another chicken dish was undercooked as well - wrong dish - one of the dishes we ordered was Mongolian beef. We got Hunan beef instead. The waitress could not even tell the difference.  The GOOD: - very polite waitress (unfortunately the politeness could not compensate for all the waiting and bad food) - Excellent Thai Ice Tea - Excellent Mango with Sticky Rice  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone at any circumstance."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner the other night. I had eaten at Thai place in shadyside several years ago and remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately there is a serious decline in the quality and service at the Wexford location.  I ordered the pad Thai with Tofu. The Tofu was cold in the center and chewy (probably made days ago). There were no peanuts on my dish and the portion was very small for the price.  My husband ordered the green curry which was very watery. He left more than half of it.  The worst part of our experience though was the service. We had our one year old daughter with us and requested a high chair. The female server with short hair refused to bring it to our table. She pointed my husband to go and get it himself. The chair was filthy and we had to clean it off ourselves. We should have left then, but my husband was wishing for curry so we stayed. To say that this waitress was rude would be an understatement. We had to get up twice to ask for refills and soy sauce. She was cold and abrupt when ordering and interrupted me twice. We would NEVER go back here again or recommend to a friend ( possibly an enemy!) but definitely not a friend :)"}
{"text":"I come here for the fried Thai spring rolls!   My 5 star review is only for them.    There have only been two other places that had similar fried spring rolls such as these - one in Florida and one in California.   I prefer the fried spring rolls that contain more than just cabbage and carrots. These spring rolls have a mixture of shrimp, pork, and glass noodles and I'll drive across town to get some.  I always place my order to-go so can't rate the place for anything other than spring rolls and their fried rice.  The BBQ pork fried rice is the best I've tasted for something so simple."}
{"text":"Service and food was good. I wish they gave some fried wonton noddles for soup though."}
{"text":"Vegas is supposed to be one of the food meccas of our country... and this place is one to avoid. Went here for lunch with coworkers and was disappointed.  The Pad Thai was pale looking and both tasteless and too sweet at the same time.  Another co-worker ordered some chicken dish that pretty much tasted like your run of the mill chinese sweet and sour chicken, but with the sauce already poured in.  The Tom Ka was bleh...  All in all a disappointment... and this is after reading the reviews on yelp.  Las Vegas yelpers let me down on this one."}
{"text":"Thai Place is located adjacent from the Target shopping center. When you enter the restaurant, the interior space look like it has different shades of green and it makes the restaurant appear outdated. Somehow I feel like the place is in need of a makeover.   I ordered the Hawaiian Curry ($11.95) with chicken which comes with pineapple, and the meal is served hot with a side of rice. The chicken taste soft, the pineapple is sweet, and the Hawaiian red coconut curry is spicy. The curry is flavorful, there is a good amount of chicken and pineapple. However, I wish they had given a little more rice with the order. I end up having to request for extra rice, which cost $1.50 and I find that is pricey for just a small serving. I also got a Thai Ice Coffee ($2.79) and request for the drink not to be sweet. Unfortunately, the drink taste too sweet.   Now almost every Thai restaurants I have dine-in offer mango sticky rice. Sadly, this restaurant doesn't have it on the menu. I ask the server \"why\" and if they were going to have it sometime in the future, and she said \"no.\" The only dessert on the menu is Fried Banana ($5.50) which is banana and coconut wrapped in spring roll wrappers, deep fried and topped with honey and sesame seeds. The Fried Banana is served hot and crunchy, it's accompanied with a sweet salad, and it taste okay. I just wish there was ice cream to go with the Fried Banana so it will make it taste better. Overall, I feel the service is friendly and the food is decent. Hopefully the restaurant would at least consider adding a little more options for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best I've been to. The ppl there is very nice & attentive, their dishes are good portions for ppl with good appetite. I recommend this place to anyone that really enjoy good Thai food! I go to this place on the regular basis and even when I bring my friends from other states they always glad that I brought them there, and the prices very reasonable, although I have not been there at lunch time, their prices are the best between 11-3 !"}
{"text":"I thought this place was fantastic! Nice, clean, relaxing, almost spa-like atmosphere, friendly service and great food!       The tofu spring rolls were AMAZING with the fresh mint surprise inside. The chicken dumplings were also very good. Both appetizers came with delicious dipping sauces. I got tiger prawns for my entree and was NOT disappointed! So much flavor, and the portions are big! All entrees come with a generous cup of white rice.  Took some home for lunch the next day. I love that you can choose your spiciness preference (scale 1-10) for every meal!      The place is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service - I have a gluten allergy and they had a specific menu on what I am able to eat. Very nice and clean dining, would go again!"}
{"text":"If you avoid the lunch specials, this place deserves a 3-plus or maybe even a 4.  I was shopping at Target, I got hungry, I was craving Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup).  It was quite good, with slices of fresh galanga root and fresh lime leaves, tender little pieces of lemon grass, shreds of fresh green chile, the usual canned mushrooms, identifiable pieces of chicken all in a sour-spicy-smooth coconut soup.  I should know better than to EVER order \"lunch specials\" in any Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"The Chicken Pad Thai is great, but everything else stinks.  Wonton soup stinks (I do realize it is a thai restaraunt), Curries stink.  I recently ordered take out and got five measly pieces of chick in my Gang Dang curry, and maybe thee pieces of broccoli.  There wasn't even any sauce.  Maybe their dinner portions are better."}
{"text":"Thai food is my weakness. I have been here twice now and each time it has been delicious. I ordered the Spicy Noodles both times. First time I ordered a level 6 which is what I normally order, but that was a little to spicy. So today I ordered and a 4 and it was perfect. Lot's of heat but I was able to enjoy it a lot more.   I also ordered crunchy spring rolls and they were also delicious.  I am already ready to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here to eat and should have known from the smell in the restaurant that the food was inferior. Ordered the combo won ton soup and stuffed chicken. It was horrible! The stuffed chicken was pretty bad in regard to the quality of it and was close to rancid. Did not finish (or start)Walked in after shopping at Target and was very disappointed! Will never go back. Price of the food  does not match the quality.Very Poor."}
{"text":"This is such a cute restaurant with great food and an exciting menu!! My mom and I met here for dinner last night and we had such a great time. Our server was nice and attentive. The owner came and checked on us throughout our meal and he was very friendly. I am always excited to drink Singha beer and eat massaman curry! The food was delicious. I got a 7 spicy and it wasn't very spicy at all. This is my only complaint. My mom had the pad Thai shrimp spice level 3 and she was very pleased with her dish as well. Highly recommend this place if you are into Thai food! I wanted to try everything on the menu so I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The chicken pad Thai is delicious here. I like that they offer a level of how spicy you want it. I haven't found a lot of places that do this. However, the service can be questionable. At times they do great and other times they rarely check to see if you need anything. I would definitely recommend their food, though."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The food is delicious, service is nice and the prices are great!  I paid 10$ including tips, for a lunch deal."}
{"text":"Awesome service, top quality, excellent flavor. I will return! It couldn't have been better. The 'Birds Nest' dish is a must try! The fresh spring rolls were so tasty. These negative reviews can't be true."}
{"text":"The only thing I eat from here is the mint chicken because it is sooooo good! I've tried Pad Thai before but it was very bland so stopped ordering that :( and the chicken satay wasn't very moist and the dipping sauce tasted funky so never ordered that again. However I must admit the fried rice that comes with the chicken satay is delishhh :) they do take out however I wouldn't prefer doing an over the phone order because they don't speak proper English and therefore your order might get messed up (saying from experience) but other than that it's pretty good! I just go and eat the lunch special because it's affordable and yummy"}
{"text":"I'm not from that area but stopped here to get dinner before heading home!! The food was very good!! Also our waitress was very attentive and made sure we had everything we wanted and needed and the owner made sure he asked how everything was before we left!! Definitely would go back and thought they gave great service!!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, friend and I went here for the first time tonight. Service was slow and the food portions were not what we expected for the price we paid. Food was OK but nothing to rave about. Needless to say, we will never go back again."}
{"text":"Yeah I would say this is decent at best. I saw this restaurant while on my way to Target so I decided to walk-in and make an order. Unfortunately the service was less than average here which almost makes me not want to come anymore. That's really too bad considering I love Thai food myself.  As for the food, my dinner was nothing much to write about to be honest. It was average at best. I mean this restaurant isn't terrible, but it can definitely be a lot better."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this so much. The location is ideal as I am in this area often. But I have tried a few times and it just doesn't stand up to some of the other places I've been all over the country. This last visit I had pineapple fried rice to go and a special noodle Dish. The pineapple fried rice had curry slices in it. Tons of it. I've had that dish 20 times and I e never had it this way. It was awful I threw it in the trash. My kids wouldn't touch it either.  There's other Thai options. I need to go out of my way to get to them."}
{"text":"Perfectly acceptable restaurant. The Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew were okay but were missing the traditional spiciness of the dishes. We were not asked how spicy we would like our meals & they were easily at a 0/4 star (the dipping sauce for the spring rolls had more kick). Aside from that, the flavor of the noodles was fine. Their spring rolls were wonderful and we would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken larb. I specifically said NOT spicy PLEASE. I don't know if it was the server or the cook who made the mistake but it was very spicy. I didn't have time to reorder or complain so I ate it anyways. My eyes watered. I actually love spicy food but my ulcer doesn't. I really don't know how much more clear I could be but I hate wasting food. And something tells me that it was a joke because the server kept asking me if it was ok, just that item. No others. Yeah, I just love waking up on Christmas day with a fire in my stomach. Merry f'n Christmas. Will never even consider looking at this dump again. Panda express has better Thai food than this place. I mean, because if they need to ruin a person's order to get attention then it's obvious it's not good."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants where the food outshone the service. To be fair, it looked like they were understaffed. Only 2 people waiting tables on a busy Saturday night. We saw a couple people leave unfortunately. However! The food is excellent. The crispy spring rolls were quite tasty. Our pad Thai (pork and tofu) were also delicious. Definitely will come back here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly customer service and amazing thai food. I normally get their bbq chicken dinner. Absolutely love their fried shrimp rice. The only reason I gave them a 4/5, is because they don't do free refills, but, they do give you a decent size drink."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai lunch special to go. Lunch specials come with soup or salad so I went with the salad. What a tiny salad!! I know it's smaller for lunch but a salad that small should never be served. Wasn't amazing to top it off and the dressing was just boring. The pad Thai was OK but I have had much better. I ordered it at a level 6 and it was very spicey, so be careful with that! I had wished it had more sauce and the portion size was smaller than I expected for the price.   Service was friendly and quick, just not the best food. Don't think I will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"They REALLY broke their heads thinking of a name. jk!....this place to its service and the food it was AMAZE. i always go thru it from getting off at work and one day tried it out. Iwas kinda iffy about it cus it looks so bland outside...but im glad i did!!!! it was pricey BUT you get ur moneys worth i order 2 things of the menu and it was enough for 3 and a toddler :D. The register lady was very nice and kept acknowledging me...soo big time kudos for that =)"}
{"text":"A frequent customer.  We LOVE curry!!  Fast friendly take out service.  Have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"First time getting Thai, very impressed! Service was great. Garlic Beef was fabulous, just enough spicy at 7."}
{"text":"I love their chicken satay lunch special and the soup that comes with it, Super friendly service and perfect for a quick lunch stop!"}
{"text":"This is a classic, hole in the wall, average Thai restaurant.  The decor isn't anything too fancy, and the radio blares bad club music.  The walls are decorated with Thai tapestries.  The service isn't especially friendly.  Yep, my kind of Thai restaurant!  Today I ordered the Thai iced tea (which was quite nice, and served in a large glass), the pad see ew with pork, and the spicy fried rice with chicken.    The pad see ew pork was average, but good.  It might have been a little bit on the greasy side, but not too much.  The only real complaint I had here was that they don't serve Chinese broccoli.  It could have had a bit more flavor to it.  With some chili powder though, that problem was mostly solved.    The spicy fried rice was different.  It had more of a peppery flavor to the spice, and it was a flavor that I haven't had before in Thai food.  The rice was slightly greasy, but at least the peppery taste provided an interesting flavor.  Other than the unique flavor, there wasn't anything to rave about.  If the overall quality of the food was a little higher, I might have changed my mind on this one.  Overall, I would say Thai Place is a descent enough Thai restaurant, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to get to.  The service was a little bit annoying, and the food was average."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from here and it was awful.  Usually thai food has a great fresh taste, this did not.  I will never go here again.  I actually went a few years ago, and now I remember why i quit going."}
{"text":"You know how many breakfast places have the same food & they're all nothing unique? This is like that. Thai Place is a Thai restaurant with your basic Thai food usuals. There isn't anything extraordinary about their style but isn't anything horrible about it either. I ordered the beef red curry & beef spicy noodles. The staff kept forgetting about our Thai teas for some reason, so that was bump in positive service. The beef overall was pretty over cooked but everything else was okay. Thai food in general hits the spicy food craving & spot & Thai Place did just that. Their Thai teas tasted old. The prices were fairly cheap though. 32 for 3 entrees & 2 Thai teas."}
{"text":"Best 'Phad Thai' I've ever had & I've tried 9-10 in Las Vegas. 'Thai tea' is also really good nice & sweet unlike other places that just taste like water. The service is really good, they try their best to explain the menu & how they make every plate. Our go to place!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, and quasi-authentic, but it's really not amazing.  I will continue to eat there on occasion due to a craving for Thai food and its convient location, but in reality, I've had so much better.  There is a lack of consistancy with their dishes (for example, last time my Pad Thai didn't have peanuts on top - what?) and they use \"how hot do you want it scale\" to cover up for the fact that their food is just mediocre.  The fact that they have been ranked the \"best Thai in Pittsburgh\" and have had so many \"celebrities\" visiting says a sad statement for Pittsburgh's grasp of good Thai food."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. We had spring rolls, which were fresh and hot. The sauce with them was really good! I ordered veggie Tom yum soup..can't say how it was because it never came out. I didn't get charged for it so it's whatever.  I got vegetable pad Thai, it was good. The portion was small. Not many veggies at all. Tons of bean sprouts! I ordered a spiciness of 1 (I'm a sissy) and it was perfect.  He got general tsaos (yes, a Thai place ) and enjoyed it. He ordered a spiciness of 5 and it was more like a 2.  The wait staff was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Not bad not great.  Food was so so.  It's hot as hell inside.  But it's cheap.  And there's hobos and drug addicts wandering the parking lot. Soooo yeah.  Wouldn't come back but isn't the worst place on earth."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Thai food. Very clean, high quality, excellent service. Don't listen to the negative reviews."}
{"text":"I drive by this place to and from work and this week, I had a short lunch break so I decided to stop by. I placed an order of tom yum soup with tofu and todd munn (fish cake) appetizer. I would not recommend the soup. It had the tom yum clear brown broth with some floating mushrooms, pepper flakes and aged tofu (texture is more densed). The fish cakes were the size of a half dollar and about 1/4 inch thick over a salad in a thin crispy flour bowl. This surprised me but it was actually tasty. I don't know that I could go back to this place. I may give it one more try."}
{"text":"The worst Thai foods I have ever had. We went there for the lunch special. Although there were only few people at the restaurant, the services were very slow and rude. We will never gonna go back there again."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best Thai food ever. But it's still a to-go place in Wexford area. Their curry dishes are ok."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 of 5 because aesthetically I believe it could be better. However, the food was delicious! I ordered the chili beef for lunch extra spicy and I will definitely be back. The soup is wonderful, ate it before I even got a picture. The plating is beautiful as well. If you are looking for a delicious meal at a great price this is a must try."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered vegetarian chile fried rice without eggs and got it with eggs in, there is not much taste in a food as well. I love Thai food but never going to visit this place again, food was very tasteless."}
{"text":"i enjoyed their green curry and pad thai here. service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing all that special.  I came here at the insistence of my colleagues as we were literally right around the corner.  I ordered the garlic shrimp and it came with a nice plate of shrimp and a plate of rice.  The food is really nothing to write home about but the service was kind of lacking.    I asked for a cucumber salad and instead they brought me a coke.  Waitress didn't really check in much.  This is one of those places you go to out of convenience."}
{"text":"Thai place is a typical Thai restaurant. The ambiance is very casual. The food is alright that's why I'm giving the place a 4 star. The lunch combos are decent portions of food but if you're very hungry I don't suggest. All together it's a nice spot customer service is good as well."}
{"text":"The food was super fresh and amazing. I had the veg. pad thai and loved it. On a scale of one to ten I ordered a 5 which was pretty spicy. If you go higher then I hope you know what you are doing. The servers were very kind and complimentary."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both the Fox Chapel and Wexford locations but this review is for the Wexford one since we've been there many times. While it's a reasonable choice, it's not the best Thai food around despite the bold proclamation on their website claim to be \"One of the top 10 Thai restaurants in the Country\" - which is so far from the truth that you have to wonder about anything else they say. Is it good? Sometimes. Is it ok? Yeah, pretty much every time - predictably ok. This used to be our go to place for Thai food before the nirvana of Nicky's took us to a much higher level. But there are some good things on the menu, albeit just a little bit pricier than most other Thai restaurants. We do like the Emerald chicken which has  fresh steamed spinach (can't go wrong with that!) and a spicy peanut sauce. The seafood ginger curry is a good mix of seafood in a red curry base and is almost always good. I also like the curry bowls, especially the panang curry, as well as the garlic pork.  In some ways, I think they have an identity problem since a lot of the offerings look suspiciously like Chinese food and not Thai. I understand that they may actually be trying that intentionally to appeal to a broader market but when I want Thai, I want THAI!!   For a strip mall restaurant, it's ok. Is it a destination? No, unless you're there for takeout. We rarely even think to go here anymore even though it's close and convenient. Guess I'm spoiled."}
{"text":"You don't come here to feel fancy--you come here for the spicy mint tofu and the fried banana coconut egg rolls!   I don't live on that side of town and I drive over just for a fix. There are touches of decor and while I do eat in mostly, it is dated. The servers seem very nice and don't bother you too much, but they always come right over with a refill.  The food is AMAZING--I don't feel bad for someone who gives a bad review for pad thai. uhg. That's like your friend who orders teriyaki chicken at a sushi place."}
{"text":"It tastes fresh. But very bland. 13.00 for chicken pad Thai that I've had better from a mall. Dry, no peanuts, tiny bit of dry bland chicken. It's over priced under flavored and just not good Thai. Save your money and time.   We ordered it to go. their 15 minute time turned out to be 25 minutes."}
{"text":"The food was a 3 out of a 10. I would bet my entire check they use frozen broccoli, peas and carrots.   CONS: Garlic Beef - DRY            Green beef curry - frozen peas, carrots and string beans             Chicken and broccoli - frozen mushy broccoli  PROS: They wrap everything secure for take out."}
{"text":"The Pineapple Curry had thick carrots and large water chestnuts in it. The Crab Rangoon had really thick dough and little contents."}
{"text":"We love Thai Place.  When my husband worked in Blawnox and I was expecting our second child, we were regulars for take-out (Gang-Karee!) over there.  His work moved to Cranberry and a year later, here comes Thai Place.  Same owners, recognized him when he walked in the door.    They are a little pricey so we only go there for a treat now that our family is a little larger (another child came along after) but they are pretty irresistible.  I love the Gang Karee and the Choo Chee Salmon and sometimes I cannot resist a  craving for Spicy Rice Noodles with shrimp!  My husband prefers the Tamarind Fish.  They also have a very inauthentic Chicken Fried Rice dish that is fantastic.  Its a little sweet, not at all greasy, and way better than any standard Chicken Fried Rice.  The kids love to split an order.   Its a friendly place, and usually pretty quiet, for dine-in.  I've never had to wait for a table.  The staff is more than friendly and will occasionally load down the youngest child with fortune cookies on the way out.  We usually go for take-out though, just because its easier than schlepping the whole clan to a restaurant.  I've never had anything there I didn't like.  I just wish it were a little more affordable. Also, while they are very welcoming of children, there is no children's menu."}
{"text":"I went here one afternoon and wasn't very impressed.  It's close to where I live, kind of tucked away by a Target.  It's virtually impossible to see it from the street.  It's a fairly small place and just one person was dining there.  Not exactly a good sign.    The menu consists of a lot of standard Thai dishes and other Asian-style dishes like sweet & sour chicken.  For a hole in the wall type place, some of their prices seem a bit high.  They are quite close to Lotus of Siam in terms of price, but Lotus is a highly regarded award-winning restaurant with a menu twice the size.    Anyway, I'm a big panang fan so I wanted to order chicken panang, but they only have beef panang on the menu. I got it anyway and was a bit disgusted by it.  The rice was OK but a rather small quantity.  The amount of beef and sauce was insane though.  Definitely a large serving but most of the beef was full of gristle and inedible.  It was also cut into very large chunks, which is different from the panang I've had at any other place.  It tasted like the panang had been cooked (like in a big roast) and then put into the sauce at the last minute.  The sauce itself was quite watery -- not at all creamy.  I had asked for a \"15\" spiciness on a scale of 1-10 and made sure they knew I wanted it as hot as possible.  Not so much as a lip tingle -- I'd call it about a 2 or 3.    I figured I'd give them another chance and go with something involving chicken and rice the next time, but I never got the chance.  I went back a couple of days later around 2:30 and they said they'd be closed for the next hour.  Note that their sign and menu says they are open from around 10 to 9, seven days a week.  I left and then came back a few days later at 5 PM or so and they aren't open again.  Nothing is on their website about their closure or anything.  So, I give up.  Long story short, I'd advise not going here.  The one dish I had was outright disgusting and they were closed two other times I went, for seemingly no reason.  This place is only like 1 mile from the James Beard award-winning Lotus of Siam, which has comparable prices and is sometimes called the best Thai food in the world outside of Thailand.  If you want something a bit more low key, a bit cheaper, but with amazingly delicious food then go a couple of miles west to Thai Style Noodle House.  I have reviewed both places."}
{"text":"I tried this place for takeout since my coworker suggested it. The portions are generous for the price, and delicious. I'm not sure if they deliver, but I called ahead to pick up the food on the fly.  I ordered the beef panang and it did not disappoint. The spiciness was good, especially with a Thai Iced tea to wash it down. I've also dined in once and our server was attentive. I recommend dining in for the lunch specials, more bang for your buck (so you can have some soup of the day and sides!) The place/location is a little dicey, but it's clean.  I usually order lunch from another Thai restaurant in the area, but when I'm jonesin' for beef panang I'll order from Thai Place :)"}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas, this place was so good.  Unfortunately, when I visited last time, it was only ok.  I'll settle for 3 stars, in case I caught them on a bad day this last time.    I ordered the pad see eww noodles... they didn't have much flavor or many veggies in them.  Probably one of the worst examples I've had of that dish.  My friends however, still love their garlic chicken and some other chicken dish that they ordered.  Meh.    Vegas has too many good Thai joints to come back but I might go again if my friends really want to!  Might see ya there."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely disgusting!  We had a work lunch catered by this place and I seriously developed Bulimia after eating their food. First of all, their dishes are not really Thai but more Chinese. Second, there's way too much MSG, and even with so much MSG, food still taste bland.   No thanks."}
{"text":"Lately the food has been greasy and the \"C\" rating makes me question ever going back... Not a happy customer any more...."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The building is kind of old so they have sewage issues. Sometimes it smells when you walk in but you can't beat the prices and quality of food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years! I have probably been going for 7 years and my man since he was little. I always order the mint chicken, yes you heard me ALWAYS!! My man will order something different from time to time but he usually orders pepper steak, sweet and sour chicken, combination wonton soup, combination seafood soup, and the list goes on.  We usually end up sharing pad Thai or chow mein, plus our little one loves the chow mein here! I recommend going for lunch because it is very inexpensive about $7 and you get the house soup, salad, egg roll, rice and your main dish! Sounds like a huge amount but it is proportioned well. We love taking our son here because the staff loves him and they always give him extra soup and extra candy. Bonus! We probably come here once a week or once a month depending on how busy we are. We are die hard fans of Thai Place !"}
{"text":"Went in and decided to just take our food home. Ordered and our food took more  THAN 45 MINUTES for a salad and noodles to come out.  It was annoying to see tables come in, eat and leave before we got our food to go.  will not be back"}
{"text":"The statement \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" truly describes my experience at this restaurant....  The Good News -- My Chicken Pad Thai was descent.  The Bad News -- Everything else.   We were seated within a minute, but it took the waitress nearly 10 minutes to come get our beverage order. Considering there were only a couple other tables of people in the restaurant, the length of time that we waited was a bit confusing.  Before she came over, the girls that I was with warned that the waitress had been quite rude to them in the past. She was aggressive and intense, the sort of person you feel badly interrupting. I had to make a special request due to a food allergy and felt very apologetic about the request afterwards due to her stern reaction.  Lunch was approximately $10+tip, which I thought was a bit steep for a strip mall restaurant. My meal started with a teeny tiny little salad that had a unique ginger dressing. My Pad Thai was tasty - the eggs and chicken within the dish were very good - but I was very disappointed in the spice level. I have ordered a \"3\" at several other Thai restaurants in the area, and though I requested a \"3\" once again, this dish came out as a \"0\" or \"1.\" My two co-workers ordered spice levels of \"7\" and \"10\" and were both also disappointed in the lack of punch in their dishes.  Personally, I would eat at Nicky's Thai Kitchen (North Shore and Downtown) or The Green Mango (Monroeville) any day over The Thai Place."}
{"text":"The combo soup here is so amazing. I get it every time I have a cold and I get better very quickly. I really think it's because of their magical soup.  Also, they have fresh coconuts to drink in the fridge, straight out of the fruit!"}
{"text":"Go here once every two weeks and I get the same thing every time for lunch which is the chicken satay so I can't speak of any other dish. The satay is great and you get a ton of food for the lunch special with is only $6.99. I highly recommend this dish for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Awful awful experience! Bad service! Bad food! Bad attitude from the waitress. Run from this place!"}
{"text":"Service was great! I ordered to go bbq chicken with fried rice and a thai tea ! The quality of food was mediocre. I will still come back for a quick bite if I'm craving thai food. I took a star off because my to go order took a little too long... It is a mom and pop shop, so only one server / cashier :/"}
{"text":"Damn they don't play with the spices. I ordered mint chicken & the lady asked how spicy i wanted it. 1 being the mildest, & 10 being the spiciest. I said 6 cause i like my food spicy & i thought i could handle it. I hella needed some milk with that plate of mint chicken. Still delicious tho. I love thai place. I haven't ordered anything i didn't like from this restaurant. The quality is excellent.  The only thing is if you order food to go, I suggest you call first and then pick it up becaue it might take a while. Delicious none the less!"}
{"text":"Good food! Doesn't look very nice in restaurant but if hungry and want Thai just do it! I was going to go out of my way to my usual spot and decided to save time and just pick up food there. I was very happy I did! Very yummy! I have sat down to eat in restaurant once as well and very good then too. They have beef Satay which was a nice change from the usual chicken. It was great! No complaints about the food! Good service as well."}
{"text":"The chicken satay was rubbery and the rice dull. The cucumber was tasty, though. This is too bad, because the other times I've eaten here the food has been fine. Hope the cooking comes back to that level."}
{"text":"I came here with my family last night for a break from turkey after Thanksgiving. We have been here many times as my brother is a fan of thai in general as well as this particular restaurant. He lives in Boston and claims none of the thai restaurants in his area compare favorably to this one, which blows my mind since he lives in BOSTON but I digress...we were the only table in the entire place and it was about 6:30 on a Friday night. My dad ordered hot and sour soup to start, my mom went with the fried spring rolls (chicken), and my aunt went with the tofu spring rolls (in rice paper not fried). They said their appetizers were tasty. For entrees my mom got her usual pad thai which she likes there, at a 3. Each time she orders it she says the same thing, \"oh wow this has a kick to it.\" Only if you think ketchup is spicy does it have a kick to it. My dad got his usual general tsos chicken and as usual said it was good, ordered at a 5. My aunt ordered the squash curry and said it was excellent with tofu. I don't recall what number she ordered it to be spiced at. I decided to try something new, basically it was chicken in curry sauce over spinach. I forget what cutesy name they used for the dish on the menu. I ordered it at a 3 and it was not flavorful, very bland. I'll go back here again since my family enjoys it but I will never come here on my own accord. Much better Thai restaurants elsewhere in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant!!!!  It's a very small place in the Target shopping center and it's easy to miss, so if you are facing Target, it is in the little strip mall on the left next to a Vegas souvenir shop. My stepdad and I come here once a week, and the food is always perfect!! The girls that work in the front are so nice too, and they remember us when we come in.  Panang curry is my favorite food on earth and theirs is amazing.  They do it with the thick sauce and that's the way I like it, not watery like some places do it.  And they will make it really spicy too, if you ask, you just need to tell them that yes you do indeed want it really spicy.  You know it's gonna be hot because they will ask you if you are really sure about that.  Level 7 has me sweating and crying a little, so you have been warned...  If you want it mild they will do that too.    Best little Thai Place in town!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places that I've tried ! Customer service is great and the food was so delicious we went back a second night"}
{"text":"Good value. $6.95 lunch special had soup, spring roll, salad, entree & rice and, served very fast. Soup served very hot & added a bit of rice when food came - perfect. They need to tell their landlord to get rid of the sewer smell!! Would have given 4 stars without the odor."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a rugby weekend with my boyfriend.  We were both craving light and healthy food and decided on Thai.  We decided to take a chance on Thai Place despite the mixed reviews.  To begin with the positive: the atmosphere was pleasant and the decor attractive. The owner (at least I assumed he was) was charming. The not so positive: both the pad Thai and the curry mussaman were extremely bland. The shrimp in the pad Thai while ample in its portion had an off  taste to it.  Our waitress was generally inattentive, despite the fact there were relatively few customers in the restaurant.  If this restaurant was in my hometown, I would not return."}
{"text":"I moved here 2 years ago and this is my favorite Thai food place  it's small,and the people are always so nice!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not spending a ton of time on this review. I'll just highlight the highs and lows.   The service was bad.  The food was really good. I had the rice noodles, 7/10 spicy with shrimp added.  The fried bananas were meh.   Okay, here's the part where the review gets 1 star and the reason we're never going back. My wife saw the server use her hands to remove things out of someone's dish that he didn't want in it, wash her hands AFTER and return the dish to him. I thought she was kidding, but my wife is a restaurant manager and that's not something she'd make up. I wish she was, because the dish I had was awesome.   We can put up with bad service; I'd have gone back for the food. However, the hands thing is the end of that place for me. Naaaaasty. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Thai food place. I've been coming here for years and it never dissappoints. Try the chicken pad see ew, combination fried rice and don't forget to get an order of the Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Beef panang! Every time I come, its always a hit or miss. They cook it ahead of time for the beef to be tender and ready to serve. They've been sold out of it a few times. So bomb tho!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out on a Saturday night.  The food was terrible.  Thai Lomein, noodles were overcooked and there were no vegetables despite the fact that I paid $1 extra for extra vegetables.  I asked for extra mini corn and received giant kernels of corn instead.  Disgusting!!  I also asked for no onion and received giant onions as well.  Also ordered Mussaman and paid $1 for extra vegetables and did not receive any, the vegetables I did get were overcooked and mushy.  Requested 5 for spiciness and it seemed maybe a 2 or 3, the noodles I ordered were a 1 and this dish was slightly higher.  Believe the reviews, this place was terrible and I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The food was gross and the service was rude and slow. It took us over an hour just to get out of there, and there were only 2 people in the entire restaurant. I don't want to waste time even going into detail over it cause I feel like enough time has already been wasted on this business."}
{"text":"One visit -- not a composite.  Easy access from the larger shopping center on both sides of Rt. 19.  Huge buildout in the area over the past 5 years.  So this place, and others, have a built-in shopping crowd for lunch and dinner.  Place is pleasant on the inside, service quick and gracious.  But I am a \"hot\" style of food and the chicken dish was bland to my tastes even though I asked for it to be on the hot side.  My guess is that their hot has been toned down from what one would find in a more \"foodie\" district.  We will go back and try again.  f8 and be there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Never in 10 years going have I had a bad experience here. Highly recommend It if you like small restaurants with big surprises."}
{"text":"Thai Tea is great and prices are totally aceptable, nothing from other world but definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I just moved here from Phoenix, and we were amazed that this place isn't packed every lunch and dinner! It was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. Out of several Thai places that we have tried here in Vegas, this is our favorite. The Pad Thai is very yummy and the Papaya salad was enough to satisfy my spicy taste buds. The fried banana is a sin to die for! Not to mention the high quality of speedy service. I agree the facility is \"basic\" but very clean and inviting. I feel more comfortable here than a fancy restaurant with bamboo trees growing out of the floors and aquariums with exotic animals. The stark booths make me feel like I am getting away with enjoying good quality for little expense at a unknown humble and tucked away treasure that only a few know about."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Thai Place.  The restaurant inside is nice, lovely decor, very clean.  The staff is super attentive and very gracious.  For an appetizer, I highly recommend the curry puffs, they were delicious.  The Pad Thai was good.  My favorite dish is the butternut squash curry bowl.  The chicken was super tender.  Just one word of warning.  They let you select your \"hot & spiciness\" on a scale of 1 - 10.  Being a hot and spicy girl, I suddenly chickened out and opted for just a 5.  Good move, 5 is \"hot and spicy\" enough for me!"}
{"text":"Typically just get the Pad Thai and Spring rolls and they are consistently good."}
{"text":"Tried lots of Thai places and this is my favorite! Have been here 20+ times and never a bad experience. Everyone is always super nice and they are good at remembering what items I want. The lunch specials are super awesome and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing here, but the staff is so friendly, kind and overdelivers on service. Highly recommend this place for a delicious, affordable meal!  I had the Tom Yum soup and the shrimp and tofu hot pot and it was the bomb. Good sized portion and excellent flavor!  Music is relaxing and it's just a really zen place. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Every once in awhile you stumble upon a restaurant, and have the best dinning experience thus was one of those occasions from the moment we walked in we were made to feel at home.  The service was unbelievably good and the atmosphere was inviting and comfortable. The appetizers were wonderful the Tom Kah soup was spiced to perfection the spring rolls crisp but light skin crunched  like no other spring roll I have ever had. The signature Thai Place Seafood platter was delicious the curry sauce finished this dish perfectly. My companion had the Tropical Bird Nest a unique must have. we both tried and liked the Singha beer imported from Thailand. We almost never have dessert but made an exception this time. So glad and lucky we did the Fried bananas well, all I have to say is Yum."}
{"text":"This place is amazing , love the Thai food and the crispy orange chicken. All the soups are very good . Fast service and fresh food. Great prices !"}
{"text":"I love this place I have tried almost everything since my family and I started going in '06. The food is exceptional and I highly recommend it. If you do go, make sure you don't leave without trying their fried bananas."}
{"text":"It's just an okay Thai food nothing to rave about! Very rude owner, I called in to order and asked if I can have more veggie instead of meat and he straight up said no!"}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment. My boyfriend and I were craving a nice spicy noodle dish, but didn't feel like driving to our usual spot (Noodlehead in Shadyside). So we decided to try Thai Place.  To start, the corking fee was $12. Seriously? That is absolutely ridiculous. I've been to fine Italian restaurants that charge half that per bottle. We ordered steamed dumplings, which tasted okay but for the price, other places are much much better. Finally, we ordered our main entrees, Spicy Noodles and the See Ew. The ratio of noodle/meat to useless vegetables was way off. Plus we asked for siracha and they gave us a tiny bowl of chili sauce that was hardly enough for half an entree.  The service was good, but we won't be retuning. If you want good thai, great atmosphere, amazing service and a cheap corking fee - save yourself the disappointment and make the drive to Noodlehead  in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing. I also love their sticky rice,  but you have to go early because they run out fast. Good service."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed, as I was hopeful the previous reviews were just a bad day.  Flavor was great, however, for $53 for two dinner entrees, and very small portions.  The containers were half full, rice was small (maybe an ice cream scoop) and hard (as if it was sitting for a while).  The portions of meat were less than expected for a dinner portion.    Staff were kind, and polite, I will not be back.    I should have know better, as the restaurant was totally empty."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to judge too much on what the interior looks like/gives back to the presentation of the food, but the decor is fairly average at best. Radio music in the background, nothing too culturally fancy. The afternoon I came here the place was virtually empty. My waitress was very attentive to my questions and my needs, even when she herself was having lunch (it doesn't bother me when employees themselves sit down to eat and are visibly doing so, at least I know they're not starving on the clock!)  I enjoyed the cucumber salad, and was surprised when I got the Tofu Delight dish, since it's much more than one person could eat alone! It comes with a heaping scoop of rice, so the meal in itself can get you full relatively quick. Judging from the menu it seemed to be a typical hole in the wall Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, with the prices being around the typical average they would be in a Thai restaurant. My reason for four stars was the service alone, because when can you beat service when they are friendly and attentive?"}
{"text":"Spring rolls are strait gansta. And to top it off with the sauce they comes to dip with it is sooooogood and last but not least to wash it down with an Xlargebottle cokacokeboys... Thanks we love you Thai... MushiMushibiotch"}
{"text":"Horrible. First of all there is no AC in the whole restaurant so it's absolutely hot. The server was super friendly and we got our food pretty fast. I had the chicken pad Thai and as a special on top I got food poising."}
{"text":"Ordered sweet and sour chicken.  Lots of rice. Vegetable in thin sweet and sour sauce. Four quarter size pieces of chicken. Salad was greens.  Shredded carrots.  Dressing was minimal.   Overall experience for lunch was poor"}
{"text":"August 20,2016. I had the pepper steak lunch special, a cucumber salad and delicious Thai tea. Some plates have more items than others. My lunch came with a soup of the day, little salad w/sweet clear dressing, steam rice, and egg role. All 4 of us enjoyed the food. The hot peppers on the cucumber salad are truly \"SUPER HOT\", don't eat them if you are not accustomed to that. The service is great, the food doesn't take an eternity and its greatly flavored. The place is not luxurious and the prices are reasonable. The restroom is worned.  I'm guessing that the owner doesn't speak English because he refused to talk to us and hear how great our experience was at his lovely little restaurant.  YES! I recommend the food here.   Food flavor  Food freshness  Quality for price   Service   Friendliness   Cleanliness   Luxurious"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  If you are looking for an off the beaten path and unpretentious (hole in the wall) type of place for Thai food, this is your place! The owner Mr. Lee and his staff are very accommodating.  For my job, I frequently use catering from Thai Place and my clients are almost always satisfied!  Some items I recommend: beef or chicken satay, chicken pad thai, orange chicken, fried banana rolls, and fried rice.  The curries are also a delight!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Thai Place.  Ordering is super convenient, prices are reasonable, and it's nearby.  I am a pad Thai addict seeking a place in the area to get my fix.  Thai Place is not that place.    As I said, ordering and paying online was easy and convenient.  The location is great.  The restaurant itself is nice.  I ordered a salad with ground pork that was actually delicious. It had large chunks of raw onion and raw ginger (weird right?) in it that I mostly picked out...but the dressing was fantastic.  The ingredients were very fresh.  I will go back for that!  The pad Thai though.  Ugh.  I added extra chicken and veggies.  I think the veggies were rotten.  It stunk up my car before I even got home.  I picked around it, but the smell made it inedible.    I will go back for that salad....and hope that I will be able to improve their rating."}
