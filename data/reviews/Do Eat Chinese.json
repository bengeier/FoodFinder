{"text":"Came here on my lunch break.  Wanted lo mein style noodles which they dont have  Got the chili fried noodles with chicken, I like a bit spicy i always add chilli oil to my food  .....  this wasnt just spicy. I literally felt like my mouth is about to melt out of my mouth & my lips were swollen,  Like it was HURTING my mouth with every bite i tried to take but it tasted good so i kept trying to stubborn my way through it , drinking ice cold water with each try & tears in my eyes until i finally gave up and got it to go . Lol  Do not get spicy anything if ur not into extremes lol    Service was great!   Would come back , & get something not spicy"}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Friendly service, owners have changed, cuisine changed, decor remains mostly the same.  We were seated in a booth and it was dirty.  Floors had scraps of food, grime built up from the previous owners were not cleaned.  The table has a table cloth and a piece of glass on top.  The table cloth was filthy but the glass was clean.   Food ==== We ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Spicy Beef Noodle.  I also came on a separate occasion and had a 4-person set meal with family.  The dry meal tasted good overall and was really happy with the Spare Ribs (see photos).  Kung Pao Chicken ============== Tasted on par with other places.  The lunch special comes with a side of rice & soup.  Spicy Beef Noodle ============== This one was a little disappointing.  Broth was bland and stewed Beef was tough and chewy :/.  Veges (Bak Choi) was under cooked and the noodle were also bland due to the bland broth.   Would we come back? ================ Maybe after a while to see how other reviewers feel.  The service is really friendly and the food (some of it) is decent.  But the cleanliness is a major issue for us, so unless that changes it's unlikely we'll come back.  The dinner was tasty!   The lunch not so much."}
{"text":"My son and I dropped in for lunch during March break.  I'm giving an extra star for the amazingly friendly service and the fact that they take credit card (a much needed necessity for the likes of me).  The staff were friendly and patient with my 7 year old who being an inquisitive and uninhibited soul tends to ask a lot of questions and make direct requests.  First off, the restaurant is clean and looks to be efficiently run.  Food - We ordered the lunchtime special cashew chicken and a plate of pork and chive dumplings.  The dumplings took a little longer to arrive but that could be because they weren't on the set lunch menu.    The cashew chicken featured a fresh bouquet of flavours... ginger, garlic, onion, green peppers and red... the staff had made it mild for me on purpose.  Chicken was fresh and moist.    Dumplings were thick on the pastry but well cooked and served with a side of vinegar.  My son gave the cashew chicken a 4 and the dumplings a 5.  I personally think everything was delicious.   They didn't have any desserts on offer but we were stuffed. Hope to visit again with friends and the husband."}
{"text":"Great food. Very spicy. Not too expensive. And great service to boot. Closes early though ..."}
{"text":"Do Eat Chinese. Yes I do!  Do Eat Chinese took over the old location of Judy Cuisine. But there is nothing much left from Judy aside from one of their waitress Cindy.  A total menu revamped with a selection more geared towards none Cantonese cuisine. A lot of spicy offers for spicy lovers like myself. They also have noodle soups and one dish meal during lunch.  Spicy Beef Hand Shaved Noodle Soup ($10.49) has a nice rich broth with good depth. I do love the chewiness of the hand shaved noodles. If you like spicy, you might need to ask for extra extra spicy.  Worth trying if you are in the neighbourhood. But there are just so many restaurants around the area serving similar items."}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant and decided to give it a try. This restaurant is newly open, and their quality of food is great. The boss is really nice and offered a free dish (Spicy beef & ox-tripe delighted) if you check-in on WeChat. Regarding the food, I got the Fish in chilly oil ($13.99), and also the Fried noodles with beef ($8.99). Both are super good and prob will come back for it. Also got the dumpling with chive ($6.99), it's okay but nth too special. I hope they can keep up with this standard. Highly recommended."}
