{"text":"I wager back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. 

I love the view and the staff was friendly and prompt. But the food is just ok and someone desperately needs to clean the beer taps. I couldn't drink anything from the tap it was so terrible. 

This restaurant is reasonably priced and has descent selections, but it isn't extensive and when I ordered DRY toast for breakfast once it came SLOBBERED in butter. (See pic) i mean, really, that is ridiculous. 

Usually I'm super hungry after a round of golf and so anything I eat is usually good, and I usually like to eat at the club house and chat about the round. In this case, however, I tend to go elsewhere to eat after I play because I just don't enjoy the food or the beer selection enough."}
{"text":"As an OB Club member I like to try out more courses than my usual and Legacy is a great bargain in Henderson.  This course isn't long but offers some interesting challenges if you play from the blue or black tees.  It's kept in good shape especially for a public course and nice that you get complimentary range balls to warm up and it's an all grass range.  I do suggest giving it a try and stay for a snack in the spacious clubhouse that has great service."}
{"text":"Course is I good shape. They are keeping greens a little longer then normal but they are in good shape and holding. Cart girls are great & make the best on the go drinks in town."}
{"text":"Tried the food here after a round.  Great standard french dip, good portion and good service.  Worth coming to as a restaurant alone with great views, nice bar."}
{"text":"We come to Legacy a lot just for the food.  The sandwiches are good and the fries are always nice and crispy.  Wife loves the french dip. Good service, a few beers on tap, nice view of some greenery."}
{"text":"I am surprised no one has written this restaurant up yet.  It is located inside the Legacy Golf Club and is very reasonably priced, especially by Golf Club standards.  We have had breakfast here several times now and it is always excellent.  The view is incredible and the food and service are great.  Not much more I can ask from a restaurant.  There is indoor and outdoor dining available as well as a bar.  They are open for lunch and have recently added happy hour M-F from 4:00 - 6:00.  The happy hour looks to be a step above the usual offerings with some of the more memorable items being Bison Meatballs, Pastrami Sliders, and Pretzel Bread.  All priced with the discount at approx 5.00 and under each."}
