{"text":"Great, inexpensive chicken shawarma on warm pita.  Excellent Greek salad. Furthermore, kudos to management/staff. Hubby lost wallet--didn't pay for his soda in the confusion and manager refused to accept $ from me. I'm very pleased with everything about the restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought it was awful... and we had just returned from being out all night which usually makes any food OK.   Had to have one chicken and one pork because they were out of chicken (and really didn't have enough to make one, but did anyway).   The guy behind the counter (owner?) told us that we were basically dumb Americans when we asked for a lamb/beef gyro. Oh well. I guess we are, he got our money and we got his trash to throw away."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think it standing outside of this tiny joint but it is a true gem. The gyros and greek salad are absolutely amazing (the best I've ever had). I definitely recommend it. Warning: You will become addicted"}
{"text":"it's actually a pretty tasty gyros and a bit of a saviour late at night...as long as you don't mind the gal touching everyones money then touching your food."}
{"text":"Do NOT try their gyros. Ever. By far THE WORST gyros I've had in my life. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Great Gyros....I did see a mouse run across the back storage room...but heh it's the waterfront"}
{"text":"Oh, man, delicious.  Expect a wait at lunch, though; everybody in the neighbourhood seems to know about this place and there's only one guy working the grill.  Gyros are huge and cheap and yummy--the meat's nicely charred and threatens to spill out with each bite.  Get extra napkins!  And get the Greek fries with feta.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"REVIEW ABOUT SERVICE NOT THE FOOD: Rude as hell! Apparently the people ahead of us didn't order anything so the clerk was getting mad or something... We came in right before it got really crowded. We ordered but couldn't tell if they took our order because they didnt ask for payment and just moved on to the next customer... Who does that?"}
{"text":"I was there for taste of the Danforth so it was extremely busy to I have to give them a bit of understanding for that but I've never been treated so poorly as I was from the guy on the front cash. Less than friendly."}
{"text":"Probably the worst gyro I've had in the city. Extremely greasy with an off taste. Staff were quite rude as well; person serving the counter was condescending when asked to ensure specific changes were made to the order. When the food arrived, it was all completely wrong. Couldn't pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"Well this place has gone down the tubes. Not sure what happened or if the owners changed but this used to be my treat on nice summer days and totally worth the walk from my office up at Front St. I popped in today and got a pork gyros on pita. The sizes have gotten noticeably smaller and the \"meat\" was almost exclusively fat and gristle with no flavour. Yuck. I'm so disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food and open late!  Popped in here for a Gyro after a evening out on a boat in the harbour.  Tried the Pork Gyro, which was very tasty!  There was a lot of oil coming from somewhere which ran down my arm, but the tzitki (sp?) was on point!  The staff were friendly and there's a great spot to sit outside and enjoy your tasty food.  If I wasn't so lazy, I would have gone inside and made good use of the giant bottle of well labled hot sauce, just to add to the flavour of my Gyro, but it was flavoured quite well."}
{"text":"Fucking garbage. I walked in and ordered a meal specifically with a chicken wrap. Walked the girl through it \"i want it wrapped up in a pita with chicken\" then the girl looks at me like I'm retarded and says \"yes, it comes with that.\" So okay, it should be good. I take the meal and take off back to my hotel to eat becausr im dying of hunger and there's no wrap! What the hell man?? We walked through it! On top of that it tasted like a hot turd."}
{"text":"I like it!  But when we were there, there was a lot of bird turd on the outdoor seating.  While we were eating outside, I was worried the whole time of getting shat on by the circling seagulls - this place is right by the water."}
{"text":"I have no idea why, but I keep returning here.  It is a tiny grease joint that is kind of on the expensive side for what it is.  They will charge you for very little extra things.  There are also a lot of cops that frequent here (even the ones that dress up in grey and carry machine guns!), so for the yelpers with outstanding warrants, you best stay away!  :)  There is something about this place though..... food is just good!  You have two main choices: pork or chicken gyro.  For those that do not know what this is, it is basically marinated meat layered onto a pit, and cooked by rotating next to a heat source.  Then as the outside caramelizes, it is shaved down onto a pita.  In that pita, you will also find sliced tomatoes, diced onions and lots of tzatziki.  There is something epic about their gyros!  You will find other items on the menu, such as souvlaki, burgers, etc.. but say away from them, as they take forever to cook.  But do order up the greek fries and greek salad; you will thank me later.  Great place to stop by after hard night of clubbing."}
{"text":"I was asked if I wanted everything on my gyro, but doesn't tell me tzatziki is $1. When I got charged I asked that I didn't want it anymore but says he can't do refunds. Then he doesn't even give me the tzatziki I paid for"}
{"text":"Update: Toronto Public Health completed two inspections at the restaurant. You can see the results here: http://www.toronto.ca/health/dinesafe/index.htm#inspectionResult  Inspectors found an immediate health hazard on the first inspection: \"One or more significant infractions were observed under the Food Premises Regulation during an inspection. Operator fail to thoroughly cook hazardous food item(s). Severity: Crucial.\""}
{"text":"don't come here for the decor come here for the food. :)  ordered a gyro on the menu -- couldn't decide the meat choice, but was offered both chicken and pork, so I said alright..   it was actually a shawarma of sliced with chicken and pork wrapped in a pita with tomato and yogurt.  taste was very good and price reasonable. $6 including tax.   there's patio seating out front. this blue shack is next to the westin harbour and captain john's boat."}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian pita sandwich from here.  It had a plethora of veggies with some tzatziki sauce on fresh pita bread.  As someone who usually prefers meat, this really hit the spot.  It had chunks of green pepper in it, and I don't even like green pepper, but this sandwich made it taste amazing.  On top of that, the young man at the counter was incredibly nice and made wonderful conversation while I was waiting for my order.    Good food. Good customer service. Would like to try the Greek fries the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Something has changed, maybe Management is new? The Tzatziki is off, it used to be the best Tzatziki ever, but it's missing something now, not enough kick, too much lemon?  Meat wasn't as flavorful, no feta on the pita, Pita seems to have changed, it used to be dense and soft with nice crispy grill marks on the outside, just a sad experience:(  it's still good, just not as good as it used to be and definitely a better option than comparable spots near by. Please go back to the old ways, this is the second time where it has been like this."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek take out fare.. Nice small patio in the summer but otherwise I suggest just taking out.  Pork gyro is delicious - well-seasoned and has nice crispy fatty pieces in the mix.  Greek fries are a must.. Super tasty!"}
{"text":"The best chicken gyro & Greek fries I've ever had!!! I'm willing to fly from Chicago for another!"}
{"text":"we ordered the chicken dinner. But the price they asked me to pay is the price for  souvlaki dinner, which is about two dollars higher. Since they don't give us the receipt, so it's hard for us to notice that. We should be carful with that."}
{"text":"Alexandros is fantastic. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have gone to Alexandros for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night and still not gotten tired of it. I was in town for the World Juniors and it happened to be between my lodging and ACC. Checked all the boxes for quality, price, and convenience. Folks, that's what we call a win, win, win -- coincidentally that's what the US team did all tourney, but I digress. I had multiple people serve me over my many visits and everyone was polite, friendly, and gave good portions. Chicken and pork were both solid. Simply can't be beat after a night when the Molsons are flowing. If you want to be the gyro of your friend group, bring them here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's interesting to see how the waterfront has transformed over the years.  There are many new sprawling businesses, amongst the bustle and the noise you'll find a tiny little restaurant situated in a dated run down parking lot; that's Alexandros.  There aren't many good dining options on the water unfortunately, but Alexandros adds an authentic Greek addition to the countless hot dog stands that line Queens Quay in the summer.  The food is always served up hot and fresh.   I only go for the gyros they are always juicy, made to order and topped with a generous helping of meat, sauce, onions and tomatoes. It's a good option for a fast-food quick bite in the area.  While the restaurant space is not the prettiest of businesses along the harbour it's dated look is a testimony to the good food it has been serving up for decades."}
{"text":"While staying at the Westin Harborplace in Toronto I grew hungry  before dinner time after a long day of travel. My husband and I went walking to look for food, immediately after Exciting our hotel and turning right the rain started which put a wrench in our plans as we had no umbrella. We quickly hurried into this place which is extremely small with one tall table that seats about 6 and a low table that sits 1. Both were filled with families seeming to be enjoying themselves and their food.   We decided to grab something there to satisfy our hunger. I opted for the veggie pita combo and he the chicken pita combo.  The lady was nice, the place seems Family built and run. The food on the other hand was HORRIBLE the chicken was hard and dark and appeared as unrecognizable pieces. The veggies were greasy as ever and none flavorful.  The fries were OK The ketchup and hot sauce was OK The Greek salad was OK However couldn't get full from that as we threw away the pitas YUCK"}
{"text":"How can I not review this little diamond in the rough on the Queens Quay in Toronto. Driving along on my way home from a late night mid week event, those late night hunger pangs started to drive me nuts.   I knew I needed something quick, fast and Yelp-certifiably delicious, quick as a wink I jumped on the Yelp app and noticed that a little hard to find place called Alexandros was spitting out the best Gyros south of Bloor. Ya ....that's right...I said it...THE BEST....wanna fight about it?  Like most take out spots at 2:30 in the morning, this place isn't much to look at BUT it's got all the fixings for an amazing take out spot. Good food, cool staff, fair prices and GOOD FOOD! (Did I mention that already)?  The menu is diverse but the yelpers recommended the Gyros and that's what I came for. Suprisingly they don't do the typical Lamb or Beer OR Lamb and Beef mix. They offer chicken Gyros (a first for me) and Pork Gyros!!  I opted for the Chicken and informed the guy to make it the way he would make for himself (always a strong ordering ploy). Meat was cooked perfectly and the X-Factor here truly was the Tzatziki sauce. Amazing! They didn't overkill the onions and the rest of the ingredients went together famously.   A bit of a trek from the club and bar scene but totally worth the trip!!  12/30"}
{"text":"Worst gyros I have ever had.   Tasted like poorly seasoned pork roast instead of a pork gyros.   Toppings are minimal.  Two of us went.  Not impressed.  Love a great gyros but I make better ones at home.    To top it off, wanted to have some more tzatki after tasting but they wanted a $1 for it.  Wasn't about to dig out more cash after having put it away.    To give them credit, after we were done she offered us some but it was too late.    Nice people but not good good."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service. We had an order mess up and they completely made it up to us.   Quick and delicious!"}
{"text":"A solid spot for your late nights, sunny walks along the quay, quick bite near the Westin, you name it! One of the best gyros around for sure, and clearly a favourite with the late night crew. Their gyro on a pita or dinner are classics, a go-to if you're in the area.  For my gyro pita, the chicken was flavourful and in perfect bite sizes, with a bit of crisp on the edges while still being juicy inside. The pita was soft, tzatziki sauce with onion and tomato were the perfect additions to round it all off.  We also got fries - generic, standard, hits the spot if it's what you're looking for. Onion rings are a good option as well as not many order them regularly, meaning they'll be fried to order! Nothing like fresh fried, right?  From the outside, and even the decor inside, it's not much. The menu is simple and everything is presented plain. But you won't be disappointed - tasty eats conveniently close right here."}
{"text":"wow, perhaps the best gyros in the downtown core.  Way better than anything in the PATH.  well worth the walk.  cheap and good.  I asked for a few fries to go in my pork gyro to make it more authentic.  good baklava too.  I'll return."}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had outside of Greece. Homemade gyro meat, awesome service, great outdoor seating, overall an awesome little place. My boyfriend loved it so much he went back for seconds; I would have too if I had the room for it."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their gyros are great, stuffed with meat and tomatoes and onions and tzatziki.  I like my gyros spicy, and when I ask, they add just the right amount of hot sauce to give them a nice kick.  The fries are always fresh and hot and crispy.  And after a long day on the islands, this is the perfect spot to relax, refresh and recharge, just steps away from the ferry docks."}
{"text":"Take out place that's open until 4am serving Greek food. It's pretty small inside, but there are tables on the patio.   We ordered 2 chicken gyros. The chicken was carved right off of the giant skewer of spinning meat. Seasoned, fresh tomatoes, lots of tzatziki. Perfect food before heading out for an evening of drinking or on your way back from one. Open until 4am on weekends!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business and kept walking by this place and figured I'd try it out, i had the chicken gyros, made spicy.  The chicken was excellent - tender with enough char for good flavor.  I'll have to stop by again next time I'm in the area and try the pork for comparison..."}
{"text":"The sign out at the front states \"world famous\". I thought that was just bragging until I had that first bite. Best chicken gyros I've ever had. I won't ever order second-rate gyros from food courts ever again. These gyros even beat the ones in Greektown, and they're only $6 each, too! Ordered at around 3PM so no complaints about the meat being dry.  The service was great as well. The man behind the counter was kind and enthusiastic after I told him it was my first time there. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night bite with a friend. I ordered the Greek burger which came smothered with feta and tzatziki so you can't complain. I'm a big fan of feta and more is always better.  Service was good, the girls at the cash were very nice and we didn't have to wait long for our food.  It's a small diner type joint so there's limited space inside and outside. It's okay for a quick bite but not if you plan on hanging around.  My friend ordered the souvlaki but it was quite oily so I'm not sure if I would try that. It didn't look very appetizing.  I'd definitely come back for the burger though. Plenty of items under $10."}
{"text":"Alexandros was today's lunch spot for my husband and I. He had the Pork Gyro Pita, I ordered the Chicken Gyro Pita and a side of feta. The pitas were $6 incl. tax, the feta was $1 extra.  I have to admit that it was a tasty lunch as the pitas both were flavorful and really yummy. However, they were kind of small to be honest.  Nothing that will fill you up for long. Also, the amount of feta cheese I got for the $1 extra is barely worth mentioning... They put it inside the pita, so it wasn't really a side, but more an extra topping and it was only maybe half a teaspoon full...  That was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Tiny! This place is so small, but the gyro was fantastic. I don't know if I was really hungry, but that was great. Some tables outside, but otherwise not much else."}
{"text":"I would've never tried this place if my friend didn't tell me about it first. It's a dingy little shack right beside where the boat used to be on Queen's Quay. The prices are cheap and the portions are big. Their chicken gyros pita is my fav! Such a great quick lunch"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick and cheerful.  Oh and also delicious.  Tasty and juicy pork souvlaki with very good onion rings.  I brought my puppy with me and they were really nice to tell me my dog cannot be inside so I waited outside and when my order was up they ran out the order to me and apologized again.  What a good way to tell me my dog is not welcome.  Truly I understand.  It is a no frills establishment that only accepts cash.  There are lots of retro benches outside, which you could sit om while reveling on the tasty and pillowy gyros.  This is a gem and don't be discouraged by the aged exterior and worn down interior.  Bring your $10 and get a whole meal that will keep you happy and full."}
{"text":"If you're in the Harbourfront area of Toronto and looking for late night food, look no farther than Alexandros.  I was staying at the Westin Harbourfront and was delighted to find this gem sitting right next to the hotel.    The pork gyro is outstanding and would be equally delicious at 12pm as it would be at 12am.  The chicken gyro is also good, but is lagging far behind in second place because it lacks the flavor punch of the pork gyro.   The exterior isn't fancy by any means, which might lead potential consumers to look elsewhere.  But as we all know, you should never judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Freshly made upon ordering food!  ;)  I would recommend the feta and Greek dressing fries; they are heavenly!!"}
{"text":"This place has a really good selection of late-night eats. The gyros is good (but small). I order the chicken dinner the last time I was there and it seems bland and dry. The burgers are good, but lay off the fries; too greasy! I live in the area, so I like to pop in from time to time, however their prices seems to have increased by quite a lot last summer."}
{"text":"the service is just bad - don't think the guy working at the counter is very honest. I came in when it wasn't too busy and was talking with my friend about getting gyros + fries. Then I decided to order gyros dinner. the cashier gives me a gyros + fries and charges me for the dinner, i think he was annoyed we took long to order because i'm pretty sure a gyros + fries doesn't cost 12.43 with tax.   food quality is okay but i suggest you be careful when going here."}
{"text":"The food is good , the girl that gets the order is not to nice,kind of rude. I will come back when it is another person getting the order . Hope the owner checks this before clients go away .!!!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin next door and had the late night munchies. This place was the only place open within a short walking distance. And I was so glad it was open.  The pork gyro is amazingly awesome. The wrap was soft, yet had a slight crisp to it. The pork was tender but crunchy from the roasting, not burnt. It had a my favorite texture. For $6CAD totally worth it.  1-star: I've had hemorrhoids more pleasant than this.  2-star: I would rather avoid this place.  3-star: On par with other similar establishments.  4-star: Will return as often as possible.  5-star: I refuse to find a better place."}
{"text":"It was almost past 2am on Sunday and a lot of restaurants were closing and none of them were near my hotel at the Delta Marriott so I hopped on a Bike Share TO and rode over there and thank god they stay open until 4. It's a small shack next to the Westin Harbour. I got the chicken gyro w/ fries and it was pretty good. I usually get lamb or steak but they didn't have either of those options. Overall if you're staying in or near that area and you're hungry late at night and love gyros then go here. Definitely hit the spot and saved the night!"}
{"text":"Alexandros serves great chicken and pork gyro's made the old fashioned way ... with real meat!! Not the processed meats you see in so many other Greek restaurants. The restaurant is small but their menu includes a number of options. Located right on the water, it is a great place for lunch on a sunny day!!"}
{"text":"Decent little hole in the wall. Had the chicken gyro which was cheap and good. About $5 for one. The fries and onion rings were pretty yummy. I noticed afterwards that we could have ordered some gravy for the fries for a little extra.   I usually can't handle spicy, but I got the hot sauce on it anyway and I'm glad I did. A good kick without being too spicy.  The owner seems a bit gruff at first, but was actually really nice and hurried outside to wipe the wet table down for us."}
{"text":"Okay, I was a real pig when I visited Alexandros a couple of weeks ago.  I chowed down two gyros, chicken and pork.  You see I wanted to compare for you good folks here.  Looks like I will have to go back because I am still not sure which one is best.  Alexandros prepares gyros exactly how I like them.  The meat is fresh and juicy and not too salty.  The \"not too salty\" part is important.  The pita bread was nicely crisped on the grill, rolled tight with the traditional toppings.  To be honest I am leaning towards the pork but to be sure I need to go back :)"}
{"text":"Tasty, surprisingly tasty. Got the pork gyros expecting the meat from a turning spit but was pleasently  surprisinged.  The meat was actually big chucks of pork that was nicely sauced up.   The portions were just enough to ensure I was not hungry but not enough to stuff me up. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Great quick pit stop for hungry roamers - located to the right of The Westin Harbour Castle hotel and about 10-15 mins. walk from the Harbourfront, Alexandro's is a delicious greasy option for pork and chicken gyros. I'm sure you can control the amount of ingredients such as sauce and onions but the gyros I got had more onions than I expected it to have which was fine by me since I love onions but was nevertheless unexpected. The pitas themselves are also delicious and you can get an extra one on the side for less than a dollar. Great, delicious and relatively cheap option if you're in the area looking for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian so my opinion may not be valid for the meat eaters, but the options for the vegetarians are horrible. The veggie pita is greasy and smothered in sauce and the spinach pie is stale.   I would recommend going to any other Greek fast food place over this place."}
{"text":"This had a sign that claimed they had the best gyros in Toronto (or something to that effect) and I'd have to agree. Well, I have only tried 3 Greek places in Toronto, but Alexandros was SO GOOD AND SO WELL PRICED. I was a bit scared because of the location, but DAYUM. This was good. I got a chicken gyro with allz the sauce. Hot sauce, tzatziki, giant tomatoes, and massive onions. My sister got a bacon cheeseburger. Also saucy, also delicious. There is limited seating inside (a long, red, high table with chairs and one on the side).  There is a patio but it was a downpour when we came here.  Total came to about $14 for the gyro and the burger.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Had a salad and gyros as take out. Was excellent and decent prices. Flavourful and good size for a take out dinner."}
{"text":"first time trying this place and it was pretty good. location, price, service and portion size were all great and as for the food... the chicken (shawarma?) was juicy, flavourful and went very well with the feta and tzatziki sauce. the greek fries were nothing special but definitely not bad at all. If you're in the mood for Greek/Mediterranean I would recommend for sure!!"}
{"text":"By far the best gyro I've ever had. The pork was real not the typical smashed together processed spam you normally get. Roasted to perfection on their rotisserie and seasoned well every bite was a joy. The place is old and dingy which I search for because then I know they have to impress with the food. I'm going back today for the chicken version!"}
{"text":"Came here on New Years   due to a late night craving for gyros. The wrap was bland and the meat was dry and tasteless, they tried to cover it up with some more sauce but it didn't work out well."}
{"text":"I come here every Friday for the chicken gyro! Soooo good, juicy and tasty.   My mind was blown when they accidentally added the spicy sauce.  I was taken on a journey of intense flavour and sauciness, I can't get off this ride.  Nomnomnom  Not so into the pork. Kinda grizzly.   Greek poutine. Yea, bring it. With a side of tzatziki so I can't stink my cubicle!  I DONT EVEN CARE IT'S THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"- gyros taste decent, but the portions are small - friendly people and quick service"}
{"text":"Great place to go late night when you are hungry. Food is cheap, and large portions. If you go to often (like i did one week) the food starts to taste bland. But after a long break it tastes delicious again! Stick to the pork over the chicken."}
{"text":"Stop wasting your time having Greek food anywhere else- this is the only place you need to go to! The  B E S T  damn gyros outside of Athens !!  Friendly staff and home made Baklava available for sale too.    Whether it's pork or chicken - full dinner or in a pita  - you cannot go wrong.    Ask for the Manzone & Strong special."}
{"text":"In the summer, I frequent Toronto Island when the sun is shining.  When leaving the ferry, I pass this place all of the time and want to try it.  I'm a huge gyro fan.    This past weekend, my friend and I were leaving the island and stopped for a bite to eat.  It's a tiny spot, but has a few seats indoors, and a number of tables outdoors.  The prices were very cheap.  And the meat was cooked fresh - you could see the pork and chicken spinning all juicy.  I ordered a pork gyro with greek fries and a pop.  It was only 7 or 8 bucks.     The gyro itself was pretty good, though I wish I had lamb :(  I was pretty disappointed that they didn't have lamb or the beef/lamb mix.  To me, that's what a gyro is.   The greek fries were really tasty (fries with feta and greek dressing).  I had never heard of them before, but I would get them again.  Nice crispy fries too.  I would go back if I was starving and leaving the beach.  The food was good, but I'd rather go to another gyro place that has lamb, personally."}
{"text":"good place to eat down by the docks, especially because there's hardly any other restaurants down there. About the same as the place on the danforth this place does gyros and Greek fries pretty well, very expensive though compared to other Greek places on the danforth that do gyros better and cheaper (Louis meat market). My favorite thing about this place would probably be that they are open till 4 A.M, I have even wandered by at 5:30 and they were still open!  IMO only really worth it if you're up that late and everything else is closed, its handy to have around though"}
{"text":"Great Food and a friendly staff!  The bacon cheeseburger was awesome!  I went in for a Gyro, but the burger looked so good, I had to try it.  Toasted Roll, crispy bacon and it was cooked just right!   Can't wait to try the gyro next!"}
{"text":"I've been to Alexandros numerous times and this is by far THE best place to get gyros in the GTA.  I've been to Greece a few times and I definitely can say these gyros are the next closest thing.  Nothing is over done.  Just the right amount of everything.  I have had a few pork pieces that were too crunchy for my liking, but it does not take away from how delicious Alexandros is.  I usually get a mix pork/chicken gyro.  You need to ask them to add fries to the gyro though (at no extra cost).  I mean that's how they do it in Greece right?  Their greek fries are also perfect. So simple, yet so yummy.  This place seems like it's open 24 hours!  Any time of the night you decide to come, these guys/gals are open.  PERFECT after clubbing meal."}
{"text":"Recommendation:  -Pork Gyros  There are a lack of options in the area, but this is quality spot for lunch. The fries and burger are decent as well. The pork gyros is moist and tender... definitely beats the chicken.  100% take out spot. There are a couple of seats in the corner... in the summer it's not too bad as there are some patio seats. Don't expect to get a seat though."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and tasty.  It's hard to beat a $7 loaded pork gyro on a pita. Whether it's for lunch or you're looking for a late night snack (they're open until 4am), you won't be disappointed as the quality is quite consistent.  The store has some small bartop seating inside and about 6 tables outside on their patio. If you're looking for a quick place to grab a bite - this is a good place.  Their baklavas aren't that great though and I would avoid ordering them (dry/hard, doesn't taste fresh)."}
{"text":"It's pretty sweet that if I have a craving for Greek, I can just head to Queens Quay to grab some, rather than having to head to the Danforth or Yonge and Eg. The shack is situated besides the Westin, with some indoor and outdoor seats.   If you're looking for something quick and casual, then I would suggest this place. The chicken is juicy and delicious, and the salad is fresh.  I usually get a Greek poutine to go with it, which is regular cut fries, topped with gravy and feta fries.    Place is open late, and is perfect for those nights where you're craving a cultured version of McDonalds."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years because it's close to home and their gyros are great with those greek fries. Good hamburger too. You might need some patience as it may take a while to get your order if there are a even a few people ahead of you. They're not as organized as you would have thought and because you aren't provided with an order number it can be confusing when you pick up your order. My order has been screwed up a lot which is why I can only give 3 stars. However it's the best fast food in the immediate area and would recommend if you want a good gyro.   As an added bonus if you sit outside you can marvel at how better the area looks now that captain johns is gone."}
{"text":"Though the venue is tiny, the flavor is bursting. I had attended a conference at the Westin and Alexandros is literally next door. The chicken gyro was full of meat. The chicken was moist and tender. Savory and balanced by the tzayziki and held together with a soft buttery pita. The portion was plentiful, so that is a great option for lunch without having to overspend. Also enjoyed the baklava. The taste of sweet honey was nestled in between the flakey filo dough layers. The chopped pistachios were at the base, like an edible foundation. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. This is more designed to order on the go. If it is cold outside, there may be room for 4 people comfortably. More seats outside but only ideal during the warmer seasons."}
{"text":"Even though it may be at the corner of Yonge and Queens Quay, it is just far enough away from the Harbourfront core to be missed... and that's a shame.  Hidden on the east side of the Westin Harbour Castle, this little place does great gyros, and is better and cheaper than most of the food along the Harbourfront.    If you're still hungry after the gyros, check out the Greek Fries, it's like Poutine if you replaced gravy with olive oil and cheese curds with Feta. Either way, it's greasy and delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered two gyros (chicken; also available in pork) in a pita, and onion rings.  The first thing I noticed is that it looked like they skimped a bit on the onion rings. They were tasty though, and nice and crispy. The gyros, on the other hand, were absolutely perfect! They were extremely delicious.  Definitely recommend and coming back many more times."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Amazing flavour on meat! The meat is the real highlight! Amazing price for a such great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Clutch drunk food at night with a nice view of the lake. The pork gyro hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"i hate places that don't listen...they asked if i wanted take out twice. and i say 'no for here', each time. then when it came, it's in a takeout box. then i say, i wanted it for here.  they then just say forks are in the bag...  ... i hate service where you're talking to a wall... sigh.. just .. howwwwww can ppl be like that...  i know i'm not the only one who has experienced this problem in many service sectors. i.e. famous subway. \"i'd like tomatoes with that\", their response, \"would you like some tomatoes\"... wttttttt.. really...  also, meat always seem to come.. .. extra extra crispy :( where it doesn't taste like protein anymore"}
{"text":"What a great day I had today.  I went to Toronto island, hit the beach, caught up with some friends, etc.  But that's not where it ended.  I also discovered Alexandros.  I won't ever forget it.  My friend suggested we go eat there after our day at Toronto Island, and boy, am I ever happy that I did!  This cute but unassuming little place in the Harborfront has delicious gyros.  I ordered the pork gyros, yes PORK! Not beef, lamb, beef/lamb mix, or chicken, but PORK!  Traditionally gyros has always been made of pork.  Any purist knows this.  Don't let anyone else try and convince you otherwise.  If you want the real deal, stick to the basics. Yes, I'm Greek.  I get my pork gyros, and noticed that the meat was nice and crispy but also juicy.  This is a result of their meat to fat ratio being spot on.  So many places tend to leave out a lot of the fat, which causes the gyros to be dry, but not Alexandros.  Also, the tomatoes were red, ripe and juicy.  Onions sliced nicely.  They even accommodated my request to put extra fries in the gyros.  The tzatziki was creamy and garlicky. In my opinion, the ratio of meat to tomato/onion and sauce was perfect.  All of that, wrapped in their warm and fluffy pita, was what gyros is supposed to taste like.  Thank you to Alexandros for making me a happy man tonight."}
{"text":"Like some previous posts, we were staying at the Westin Harbour Castle and looking for something nearby that was not too pricey.  Alexandro's fit the bill. It is literally right next to the hotel.  We had to skirt around the construction.  The menu is not huge, but prices were reasonable. There are burgers, fries, Greek salad, chicken or pork gyros, chicken souvlaki and onion rings.  We ordered a burger and a chicken gyros and onion rings to go.  The burger was quite large and tasted ok. The chicken gyros was also just ok. It seemed a little bland, probably because they are extremely skimpy on the white sauce.  Apparently you can pay for extra sauce, but judging by previous posts, you still don't get much more.   Overall, the food was just ok and the prices were decent, but I wouldn't rush back to try it again"}
{"text":"Went here a few months back and it was decent for late night gyros.  My review is based on being around the city + Greece for gyros. Review is based off of a pork gyros  Pros: Quick service Decent price (Around $6 for a gyros fairly loaded with meat!)  Cons: Meat seems off? Not a lot of flavoring Tzatziki is OK.   I'd honestly give it around 3.5/5.  Would go back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"Came here last night, after about 10 yrs of last trying it, cuz i was living abroad till last Aug. This place still rocks just like it did back in the days after coming out drunk from Guv.  Had the pork and chicken gyros with my gf, and both were awesome, but the pork had that extra little bit of fatty goodness to it. People keep saying Messini's, but i say both are awesome, so just enjoy people and stop fighting! Lol."}
{"text":"This place comes through in times of desperation from me. It's not bad, but it's not the best gyro in the city. But that's ok. It's fast, inexpensive, and gets the job done. The gyros are tasty, cheap and oily. The tzatziki is garlicky, the burgers are filling and I like those crispy, cheesy Greek fries. They're open late, you're in and out, and there's a certain charm to being inside a hut that you think might crumble into the lake at any given second. The Danforth location is a little better, but the theme remains."}
{"text":"They are in demand due to their locations thus...their love for new customers have depreciated. While I have ate there many years before (6years), it is with sad heart I say...  \"They straight up lie to your face\".... when you ask for extra sauce. They say yes it's in there, but hands you a regular gyro. While their mistake may seem small, it's the fact of a deliberate lie.....  What else is lie in that case? The meat? The breads? I am not assumeing... I am just questioning. After all, if they can lie about the quantities...perhaps they are also lieing about qualities.  Price is definitely higher than Messini at Christie and Danforth. Yet Messini adds long French fries in their wraps...is not cheap about their sauce either. Their service is also top notche.  I understand that Alexandros probably has a higher overhead due to its location which requires them to cut corners to save money. However, I will only go there if I am desperate from now on.  Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Excellent place.  Very good gyros, salad, pita bread.  It is a small place - people usually take their food out."}
{"text":"The gyros were pretty good but the chicken was a bit dry. They were on the small side but the price made it fair. The Greek fries were dry and overcooked. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Terrible location, almost zero parking, and almost no online presence, it baffles me how I even found this place. Luckily all those years ago, I ventured 50 feet from the now defunct \"Captain Johns\" eyesore, and tried my first Pork Gyro. This place now holds a small piece of my heart, especially when I am half in the bag, and looking for a greasy bite to eat.   It's pretty rare that I ever crave Greek, and I am not even sure this place counts, but it's seriously heaven in a wrap. The Pork Gyro is always my go-to, and never order anything else. The meat is sooo moist, with crispy bits that leave you salivating for more. After years of trying other spots in T.O, I don't think I've even tried a Gyro that's even remotely close to this one.   Will you hate navigating down Queens Quay just to get here? Yes. Will you yell and scream because parking sucks? Absolutely. Will you regret coming after your first bite? Nope. Prepare yourself for porky goodness heaven!"}
{"text":"come for the great greek food, then leave. I had the Gyro and some of a kabab and both were very good. Salad is fresh, special sauce is tasty. If you don't like their food, it is because you are a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I wasn't expending much for a gyro place in Toronto but was pleasantly surprised. The chicken gyro plate was very tasty and favorable. Hidden affordable jem great for lunch."}
{"text":"Best Gyros in town hands down.  Obviously nothing like how they make them in Greece, but they're very close!  I can eat these all day, every day.  Make sure you ask them to mix the pork and chicken.  It's the only way to go.  Oh and get them to put fries in your gyro!"}
{"text":"For all the raving.. I was left very very disappointed with the quality of the meats. Just disgusting. Yuck."}
{"text":"Ok I have been reserving my review until I had visited this tiny little shed in the water, juuuuust to be sure I give what I feel is an educated and factual review.   Well....the votes from my several visits here have been tallied and I can honestly and with 100% certainty state that I LOVE THIS LITTLE PLACE and it's cute little owner and cute little daytime cook!!!  Greek fries are AMAZING, and u can smother them in chicken or steak gyro - and I mean SMOTHER...they're not skimpy on meat or cheese at this place. OPA  Friendly service and ample outdoor seating during nice weather, with a fantastic view of the lake.  Omg as long as I work on Queens Quay I'll be eating here.   So ladies...back to the cute cook, Greek I'm guessing - early to mid 20s - not sure if he's single .... But to all the single young ladies in the 6 - ok surrounding areas included - come for some Greek fries and maybe leave with a BF? He's too young for me but just letting u ladies know he's there.   Be sure to invite be to the wedding, ok?"}
{"text":"Delicious!!... This is a little place at the end of Yonge street, just in front of the lake... The gyros are incredible delicious, and the prices are very inexpensive... If you are around and like something easy, fast and healthy this is a great option!!.. I would love to go back there!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here to get a bite while staying a the Westin. We both got chicken on pita. Not the typical gyro we're used to but nonetheless tasty. Definitely a good place for a cheap quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"After watching a concert at the harborfront center we stumbled on the citys best gyros, perhaps not.  You have a go and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had, hands down  No mystery meat here- they serve pork or chicken cooked on a spit, similar to a shawarma place. You get a choice of pork or chicken, and it comes with onion, tzatziki,and tomatoes, hot sauce optional, and there are other things you can choose from  Each gyro is $6 with tax, and while they are smaller than the typical gyro, the real meat is more filling that the meat roll thing you usually get.  Definitely worth your while!"}
{"text":"Cheaps eats, tasty as heck, and open late. Definitely a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Great value and delicious flavour. I had the pork gyro wrap it was fresh & warm. The people behind the counter were friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is small but on a warm day you have outdoor picnic tables to eat at by & yes some limited seating is available inside.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had to check it out as my man is greek and he wanted a gyro overall not impressed combo 1 was gyro salad and fries thrown on a tray flavour was ok n But portion was small for 15 with tax"}
{"text":"My favourite late snack food. Gyros is a steal. Open late night past 2."}
{"text":"Quality gyros food - high level of quality and always consistent.   I always get either the gyros pita or the dinner - and I can always expect consistent satisfaction. It's a good feeling to know that this is a place you can always count on to A) give you large portions B) always be open ( even if there are snow storms) C) provide QUICK service (my food was ready before I finished this review and D) friendly smiles and service that will make your day better.   The gyros pita comes with the standard - ask for fries in it for a kick.   The dinner platter comes with pita, salad and fries. I sometimes get half chicken half pork to mix things up."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 chicken gyros, they were around 6 CAD each and the size was good. I felt that the meat was lacking of flavor, but in general they we ok."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot several times, as it's conveniently located by my place and open very late when no other restaurants are open at that time in the area.   Their lamb/pork gyros are meaty and delicious. My friends liked them as well, although one complained it was a little overcooked. The menu is well priced. Make sure to check the deals they have at the counter; you can save yourself a couple bucks off of drinks or side orders."}
{"text":"Stayed at westins hotel and decided to get food at 11pm. we didnt want to take the car out again because parking was a block away. found this little spot open until 4am. boy do i regret the $10.95 i spent here. i dont think i'd go back here if i was starving. the two gentlemen who work here are very nice but nice doesnt mean great food. they do not serve lamb or rice. maybe im from nyc but this place has got to be a joke. i spent $65 here and could not get extra sauce. Extra sauce was $5. $1 per sauce. this was ridiculous. the pork meat was burnt and hard. the only they have going for them is their white sauce. The salad was dripping with oil. Never again."}
{"text":"Been here years ago and it was so good their pork gyros. I came back here recently and it was different story.I orderd the pork souvlaki dinner this time because they  were sold out of pork so got the chicken instead.  The order came and it was generous amount of food. The chicken was really dry sadly and the greek salad it came with was dress with too much oil.   Maybe I just caught them on a off day, maybe its just the chicken. I might give them another try because I remember the pork gyros be being moist and had crispy bits kinda like chinese roast pork it was so gd. If I ever go back and it blows my mind again I will change my rating."}
{"text":"Maybe the best pork Gyro I've had. Delicious, greasy fast and cheap. What more could you ask for?  I can't wait to get another one."}
{"text":"My husband and I live across the street. The pork meal with Greek fries is definitely our go to meal when we don't feel like cooking! Love it"}
