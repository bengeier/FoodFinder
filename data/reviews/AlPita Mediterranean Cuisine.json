{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've tried in Cleveland! Ordered the beef shwarma and grape leaves. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here a few nights ago and enjoyed my dinner so much. We ordered one of the vegetarian platters as an appetizer and I had a falafel wrap as my main dish, they were both so delicious and I definitely recommend the platter. Since it was later on a Sunday night, we were the only people there for a good half hour but the servers were still friendly and happy to have us!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very pleased with the seasoning, portions, and staff. This is on the regular rotation!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great fatoush. Gyro platter, shish tawook. All fantastic. We have been here a couple of times and have been really pleased. So thankful this opened close to our home. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great location and amazing service. However, both paled in comparison to the delicious food. Coming from NYC, I'm very judgmental of most Middle Eastern restaurants. However, the chicken shawarma was to die for and the knafa cheesecake was the perfect balance of sweet and rich flavors. 10/10 will come back when I'm in the beautiful city of Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Excellent service too. For a new restaurant in the area, they definitely have potential to grow into a community favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. We ordered the sample platter and everything was fresh and delicious. The food was so good that we returned 3 days later and our meals were again fresh and delicious. We plan on eating our way through the menu."}
{"text":"Well below average with our order.  Hummus was pasty and the side of veggies were nasty.  The mini carrots looked like the ones that fall in the bottom of my fridge."}
{"text":"Beef Kabob was juicy and excellently cooked!  Hummus was a little thin but tasted great.  The grilled vegetables had good flavor and lamb was tender.  Definitely will come back to try the baklava as I was too full but it looked great!!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly staff, quick service. Food however left a lot to be desired. Tabouli is tasty yet overpriced as it does not come with a side of pita. Grape leaves were dry and bland, I had to pull them apart to make sure meat was inside of them as I didn't order vegetarian and I did manage to find very tiny pieces of ground beef. All for 19 dollars. No thanks, won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch today and were so pleased with the fresh food, gorgeous atmosphere and such friendly staff. We got the tabouli, kibbeh, shawarma and two fresh fruit cocktails... divine!!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"To start - service was incredible and they definitely wanted to make sure that you were taken care of.  Very easy to talk to, as well and they weren't afraid to tell us the background of the history of how the restaurant came to be.  Respect the journey.  Secondly - we ordered the Mediterranean Mix grill for two.  HIGHLY recommend ordering this - you will be floored and satisfied at the same time.  The Tabbouleh was delicious, pita warm to perfection and the meats were seasoned just right, in addition to the nice helping of rice.  In addition, there was enough food left over to make a lunch for one and a dinner for two.  Portions were in the customers favor.  Highly recommend everyone come and try this place out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the best mediteterian cuisine place I've ever eaten at more authentic and less franchise. The prices are worth it and the dinning room is very nice. The people there were also very welcoming. Defenitly recommend to come eat here !"}
{"text":"This location has been a revolving door but I hope this one is here to stay. Sure, the ambience leaves a little to be desired - but the food is phenomenal. We usually go with a baba appetizer and the Mediterranean mixed grill. The rotisserie chicken has great flavor, and perfectly cooked. The wife loves the schwarma meat. We are averaging about once a week now and always leave stuffed.Friendly and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Great new place in River.  The appetizer combination, shawarma sandwich and salad were amazing.  Also the staff is all in on making you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our Friday night meal. Food was fresh and well prepared. Enjoyed avocado hummus and warm pita. Delicious gyro with salad. Others enjoyed lentil soup and various salads. Service was OUTSTANDING. Not crowded. While we ate there this time I noticed lots of food was ordered for take-out. UberEATS drivers made several appearances too. We will return to AlPita!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try Al Pita out on a whim today for lunch. SO glad we did. Authentic and fresh flavor. Delicious.... really. Went simple and tried the hummus and pita, falafel wrap and a Turkish coffee. Was the best I've had in the Cleveland area by far. The staff was very welcoming. Will be a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"Best food delivery we had while I was in Cleveland. The falafel could have been better, but the hummus and the lamb gyro were excellent."}
{"text":"Extremely amazing. Not my first time trying authentic Mediterranean food but definitely the first time loving it. Excellent service, amazing food and great prices. 10 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Better than the other Mediterranean spots in the area. Super fresh and the server was friendly, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out when I saw they were having a 40% off deal for their grand opening. Glad I went when there was a discount offer though because I would have been pretty disappointed paying full price for this meal. $16 of pretty much 4 small cubes of chicken, basically still raw \"grilled veggies\" and \"meh\" rice. For a business who is directly competing with the already very established Aladdin's you would think they would pull out all the stops to convince people they are worth coming back to. $16 for one mediocre skewer, raw peppers, and some bland rice? I should have just gone to Aladdin's. Overall super disappointed, I won't be back.  Update: actually I'm so disappointed with this meal I'm changing it to one star. Come on guys, did you even actually try to cook these veggies? They are completely raw still."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. The 3rd day opened and they were so nice and professional. The owner made his presence and explained his vision for the restaurant with such passion and excitement, which always makes a place even more fun to go to. I had the tabbouleh falafel wrap and added hummus, along with their lentil soup. I'm so excited a place opened in that space that has real potential for growth and might break the spell of bad restaurants there"}
{"text":"This is the second night in four days. I had chicken shawarma  and the gyro, both were outstanding. My husband had farroj and fattoush, he loved both!! We also had avocado hummus and grape leaves.......most authentic Mediterranean food we've had in a long time!!  We highly recommend it! !"}
{"text":"AlPita was just okay.  The food itself was great.  I got the beef shwarma plate and really enjoyed it.  The shwarma was great and flavorful.  The cons were that the meal took a very long time to prepare, even on a slow Wednesday night.  The atmosphere was strange, as well.  It looks like a fast casual restaurant where you order at the counter, but it is actually sit down.  However, the cheap decor and what not makes it feel very fast casual.  I would potentially go back.  But it is not a favorite."}
{"text":"Slightly pricier than expected, great atmosphere, and great gyros with huge portions."}
{"text":"Very good but very very expensive !!! Would be nice if they had sides for cheaper. Falafel veggie platter so expensive!! Falafel shouldn't be so expensive!! Shawarma sandwich was good ..  everything is good but too expensive"}
{"text":"I'm torn on the rating for my review. Let me explain...  Al Pita takes over the Fresco Mexican restaurant space in Rocky River (this space seems to have a high turnover). Staff was pleasant and from talking to the owner I learned that he is Lebanese, his family runs Falafel Xpress in Lakewood, and he knows everyone in the Mediterranean restaurant business. He seemed excited and passionate about this new venture and explained that while there are a bunch of \"fast casual\" Mediterranean spots around town, he wanted his place to be more of a sit down experience.   Since I had a guest visiting me for the weekend we decided to hit up Al Pita and get a sampling of their menu:  *Kibbeh $8 - 3 pieces  *Non-Vegetarian Grape Leaves $9 - dozen *Vegetarian Sampler $17 - regular hummus, baba, avocado hummus, falafel, taboulah *Mediterranean Mix Grill $26 - beef and chicken shawarma, half a chicken, rice, side.  *Baklava $6 - two pieces *Knafa Mabromeh $5  Total $71  Let's start with the good stuff. Right off the bat, the food smelled amazing! They also allowed me to do a special request for one of the sides which I really appreciate. The regular hummus is pretty good, as was the kibbeh which seemed to have some cinnamon in it? Taboulah was lemony and fresh.The half-chicken/Farroj was so juicy with lots of herbs/spices and some nice bits of crispy skin. The falafel is definitely crunchy, no worry about them getting soggy.  Baklava was A-Ok as well (still like my mom's the best though).   Now time for the not so great. I could not taste garlic in the garlic paste/sauce. To me a good garlic paste has a nice bite to it, a little goes a long way to enhance your meal. This stuff was too bland, more like regular mayo. I also did not like the rice, it was cooked al dente, so too hard for me, but my dining companion didn't mind it. The grape leaves were disappointing since they had the hard rice and no flavor. The non-vegetarian version is supposed to have meat and tomatoes mixed in but I could not see or taste them. Neither of us thought the avocado hummus was anything special so just stick with the regular hummus. With the beef shawarma I had to spit out a couple of pieces because they were just chewy gristle. Lastly, the knafa was missing the sugar syrup that makes it a sweet dessert.   So to wrap it up, Al Pita is a clean sit down restaurant with pleasant staff. They have some pretty good meal items and they have some items I would not order again. While prices are similar to The Fountain in Westlake, they are still higher than any fast casual Mediterranean/Middle Eastern place in the area which is somewhat deterring. I might get the mixed grill (mmm half chicken) one more time if I can do hummus and taboulah for my sides because overall those things were the tastiest, and with the portion size you can get at least two meals out of this dish (you better for $26), but other than that, I don't see myself going back to Al Pita. I get take-out more than I dine-in so them being a sit down restaurant gets no points from me. There are just too many tasty cheap places out there (Oasis, Dolce Wraps, Sittoo's, Ferris Deli, Boaz Cafe, Naf Naf Grill, Falafel Xpress, etc).  I rate them 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food. Too expensive. Also I would like to be able to buy just 3 falafel or have baba ganoush as a side. Appetizers way too expensive. Knock of a dollar from everything or something. Or have a lunch special. Keep up with the good fresh food thou."}
{"text":"Being of Middle Eastern descent I found this new restaurant that has only been open for six weeks. Very skeptical I ordered all of my favorites and in a lot of detail went through everything. All I can say is wow. Knowing her food in detail I can always pick out little things here and there but I can honestly say that everything was very good all the flavors were very good the presentation was outstanding the people are very gracious the restaurant is very clean the bathrooms are clean and there is plenty of parking. This place is worthy of a 5-star rating and this is my first five-star rating in all this time"}
{"text":"Sad to say, I'm not a fan. Our food was ok, but far from great and definitely not worth the price...we will not be coming back. There are plenty of similar restaurants nearby with much better Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"My wife and i tried Al Pita using uber eats.  It was great!  the portions were big and everything was delicious.  i got some sort of chicken - i dont remember the actual name from the menu but it was juicy, grilled perfectly, and so flavorful.  We will for sure order again or eat there in person.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"we got the mix mashawi ($25) and the mild buffalo wings ($8). the buffalo wings came a bit crispy and was cooked and season very nicely. the mix mashawi was pretty good. the service was good and people are friendly. over all, this place is very good."}
{"text":"I am a Clevelander that has gotten sick of Aladdin's buying up all the Middle Easter restaurants in the area and then ruining the food. Being Middle Eastern (Egyptian) myself, I have been searching for a Middle Eastern restaurant that makes food as good as my aunties. Well, I can tell you I found it in Al Pita! The food is amazing, isn't watered-down Americanized Middle Eastern cuisine; it's flavorful and made on the spot. Say goodbye to the gross prepackaged and frozen fake \"Middle Eastern food\" Aladdin's throws thoughtlessly on to your plate- check this place out instead (and save some money while you're at it!)!   P.S. The kunafa is incredible!"}
{"text":"We had just finished our workout and wanted to try this new spot and boy were we delighted. Fresh tabouli and tender Shish skewered with peppers served over a delicious bed of rice. Washed down with tasty mint tea. The food did not disappoint.   It's worth a stop especially while it remains relatively unknown and visited. The service was top notch and reliable. Hit this up ASAP!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time over the weekend. Everyone there was super friendly and accommodating, seating us where requested, explaining menu items and making suggestions. Both of our meals were fantastic - lamb gyro salad,  and kebab plate. Also, the kibbeh was the best I've ever had. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant! I've gotten takout several times and everything has been really well cooked and super fresh. The real standout dish though was the chicken tawook. I've had a ton of really good Lebanese food but I've never tasted chicken tawook this good. The chicken was perfectly cooked and so so so flavorful. Usually tawook is under seasoned, but not the case here. My husband who is usually a beef eater preferred the chicken! So I would definitely recommend this restaurant and also this dish."}
{"text":"Great food for takeout or dine in. Servings are generous and everyone is incredibly friendly and attentive. Lamb, beef, chicken, and veggie entrees and apps all get thumbs up from parents and toddler."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I ordered the Mediterranean mixed grill and veggie sampler. Good food compared to nearby middle eastern restaurants. Good amount as well."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this place for me and my boyfriend. The food are very good and the waitress is very good take care and very friendly. If you want to try a different kind of foos other than asian and american food , I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great lamb gyros, fries, lentil soup, baklava, beautiful day in the open air restaurant and friendly service. 40% off special until August 11th, I believe."}
{"text":"I never really had much mediterranean food before, so i wasn't sure how i was going to like it but to my surprise AlPita was fantastic. I have gone there many times now and I love it. I have brought a lot of my friends with me to try it bc i just love it so much. I would most definitely recommend going there. I had a male server and he was extremely polite and helpful with me picking out a dinner because I was unsure what some of it was. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was extremely clean. I thought the prices were very reasonable as well. definitely worth it. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. This space at the Beachcliff strip mall in Rocky River has seen a couple mediocre restaurants come and go quickly over the past few years. So we didn't expect much out of Al Pita. But we've been there three times, and it's already one of our favorite Middle Eastern restaurants in Northeast Ohio. Start with attentive and welcoming service and an attractive and spotless dining area. Then there are the wraps -- moist and chock full of tasty ingredients. Don't miss the fattoush salad! They just added mujadara to the menu on a tryout basis, and it's some of the best we've had, with crispy onions on top and loads of baked pita chips on the side. Let's hope they give it a permanent spot on the menu. And let's hope Al Pita is here to stay."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Falafel Tabouli Pita Wrap for take out. Very fresh ingredients. Large in size- filled me up! Took a moderate amount of time but that's because the falafel was being made fresh. Worth the wait. Good service and a clean place! Definitely looking to go back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"We checked this place out last night. Despite one negative review, most of the other reviews on Yelp have been positive and this one will be no different.  This place has a small casual dining room and does offer table service rather than the grab and go atmosphere that most of the previous restaurants in this location had.  The menu is large, lots of choices. We ended up with the Mediterranean plate for two and a tabooli appetizer.  The tabooli was actually very good! My only gripe about the meal is that the price for the tabooli $10, I thought was a bit high for the portion size.  The main dish, however, made up for it in terms of amount of food for the price. This plate was piled high with chicken and beef shawerma as well as a piece of a rotisserie style chicken with yummy spices on it. It also came with a side - we chose hummus- and also a portion of rice and a tahini based dipping sauce and a garlic sauce. The plate was $26 which is on the high side, but seeing as how there was table service and I have enough leftovers that both my husband and I will be able to have lunch from it today - I don't think $26 is that bad. The shawerma was very good. The rice was wonderfully spiced. And growing up in a house that ate hummus about every other day (homemade), I can say with confidence that the hummus was good The restaurant also offers an array of delicious sounding cocktails (non-alcoholic). I would like to come back and try one of those.  All in all, I will absolutely be back to sample some of the other choices on the menu - maybe a sandwich or some kibbeh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Middle Eastern restaraunt in Cleveland! The food is amazing and unique. The chef is creative with the menu while still maintaining an authentic taste. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. Everytime I've dined in I've felt taken care of. If I could I'd give more stars!"}
