{"text":"Nota bene: this review is coming from a person that is meh about fish in general. My fiance may have given 4 stars, he loved his 39.99 \"special\": a good sized piece of salmon, a tiger shrimp and a large scallop. A few bites of potato and roasted veggies were served on the side. No soup or salad came with. Slightly pricey for the amount of food, but considering the location and quality of the fish it seems reasonable, I guess.   The caesar salad wasn't really a caesar salad. Dressing was off, no flavor of garlic or anchovy, and I have sensitive taste buds! But it was good nontheless, I mean, it's lettuce.   The eggplant parm. was good, as expected.   The fish was cooked perfectly, not over-done.   The bread was fresh.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Mediterra Restaurant & Lounge Visited for a business dinner. Overall impression is that this place is \"past its best\". Food, service and atmosphere very out-dated. Staff were slow, even though the place was empty and we said we wanted a quick dinner. \"Special\" homemade Asparagus soup was bland, dull and luke warm. I suspect that the chef had made it from a packet. It had no flavour of asparagus. My Tuna was cooked ok, but cool in the centre, which made me think it had been frozen. Accompanying salad was not dressed and limp. Wine pretty expensive for the quality but that may not be unique to this place - i have little experience in Toronto to compare. Colleagues seemed to enjoy their food, although did not think it looked great. Bread was pretty dull, which is usually good in mediteranean places. Not sure what this place is trying to be, a seafood place, a greek place - concept seems confused. A place for Gordon Ramsey to come and give a wake-up call to!"}
{"text":"As you walk into Mediterra, you first notice the cloudy Lobster tank that looks like it has not been cleaned in years.  I dined with a  group during a business dinner.  The location is great and the food is decent, although expensive.  The service was so bad it was embarrassing.  Our female server pretty much ignored us all night (even though the restaurant was basically empty.)  Drink orders were wrong and refills were very slow.  It was like she did not want to work.  There are too many other good restaurants in Toronto to deal with the rude service and high prices."}
