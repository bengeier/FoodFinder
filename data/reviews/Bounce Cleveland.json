{"text":"There was a cover charge but it was pride so ok. Bar was huge and the drag show was great but it would feel empty without all the people here for pride."}
{"text":"I can't, for the life of me, fathom how another gay bar in this city hasn't blown this bar out of the water.

I've never had an enjoyable experience, but I keep going back--hoping each time will be better than the last! 

The outer Union Station area isn't bad--but it's also generic. The inner dance area-- where the fun SHOULD be--is regularly disappointing.

The drag shows--in which everyone who WANTS to dance is forced to sit and watch a performer--go on for what seems like forever. They also seem to occur nightly, as far as my experiences have gone.

The music is mostly terrible. We left early tonight because the DJ never even looked up from her computer to notice that the dancers on the stage slowly stopped dancing and eventually vacated the dance floor. This is not only poor observation, but horrible DJing. Even a semi-decent DJ would recognize that her choices are directly responsible for an empty dance area.

There is no reason that the \"biggest\" gay bar in Cleveland should be as dead as Bounce is on a Saturday night. God, I want to like this place so badly, but every time I give them my $5 at the door I end up regretting it."}
{"text":"Bounce, is an alright bar. The drag shows are \"okay\" they play the same songs and do the same routine every night and all they do is walk around in a circle and expect you to tip them for it. The drinks are good, i go to a particular fellow who gives good service and is always friendly, i forget his name but he's the really tall one, haha. The crowd is an average size unless there is a rupaul's drag race queen then the house is packed, then it just is hectic. Other than that this place  is just okay."}
{"text":"Horrible, gross, sad.

First three words to come to mind.

I should start off by saying that Bounce is decent for what it is: a trashy place to dance if you're young and/or not really a part of the mainstream \"scene.\"

Having said that, for a gay man looking for a place to hang out with friends and meet other gay men, it is a shame that this is one of the only places that Cleveland has to offer. 

First of all, the place is dirty and could greatly be improved if the owners would put a little money into fixing up some basic problems (look at the booths in the \"dance\" area, and try to find one that isn't being held together by black electrical tape).

Second, as others have said, the clientele is young. Very young. Often alternative/emo kids who go to the gay bars because there isn't another hangout for their \"scene\" that allows 18+. It's great that they're there having a good time, but for a gay man looking to meet other gay men, I definitely feel in the minority. The next biggest group you'll see is lesbians, followed by fag hags with their young baby gays. Where are all the young, put-together gay men hanging out??

This is also the only club I've been to where I have seen, on multiple occasions, people wearing pajama pants.

The music is also often waaaaay too loud, leaving my ears ringing for hours after I leave.

I gave Bounce 2 stars because, unfortunately, it is one of the few gay bars/clubs in Cleveland that actually draw a crowd. Sometimes, I am surprised and there is a decent amount of good-looking, level-headed guys there, and I often do bump into people I know. But those times are rare.

This place has potential, but unfortunately, unless the clientele changes, it will continue to be a bust."}
{"text":"A lot of great changes since the new owner and new management took over.  Expanded beer, wine and cocktail lists and outstanding discounted bartender specialty cocktails every Saturday.  Drag shows every Wed, Thu, Fri and Sat and a new Ru Paul's Drag Race star the last Saturday of every month."}
{"text":"If you are gay and looking for a dance club, this is the place in Cleveland. Shit. If you are straight and looking for a dance club, this is the place in Cleveland. The crowd is definitely a bit on the younger side."}
{"text":"I've been to Bounce twice now, and enjoyed myself thoroughly both times (at least I think so...I don't exactly remember the first time very well).

They have good music and a decent crowd on Friday nights.  Thursday nights are amateur drag nights, and while the crowd is smaller the night is really fun.

Drinks are fairly priced when they have specials ($4 long island Thursdays?  Yes, please!).  Non-specials are a bit steeper.

I like the setup for the most part.  The bar is huge, giving plenty of room to snag a spot and wait on a bartender.  There are a good amount of tables to congregate around as well."}
{"text":"Bounce is not really a Gay club.  The majority of the patrons are straight.  One has to wait in a very long outside to enter the club and they charge a cover. They have drag shows that are not very good.  The music selection is awful but it seems to appeal to the straight crowd.  The neighborhood surrounding Bounce is one of the highest crime areas in the country.  Do not go for a walk in the neighbor hood around Bounce.

I wish Bounce would stop labelling itself and stop advertising itself as Gay club.  It really is not a Gay club.

If you are Gay,  avoid Bounce unless of course you like to mingle with straight females in their early 20s and some of them even in their teens."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was literally shocked when I visited bounce the other night, 02/27/16. 
As someone born and raised in Cleveland, i've had a love-hate on-and-off-again relationship with Bounce since the early 2000's. As many can remember, it was packed every weekend, the best drag shows, always strong drinks. Over the years, it has continued to fade, it has been very sad to witness. Yet, every time I return home, the questions is always, \"should we go to Bounce?\" Glad I took a chance. They have done some major re-branding, and a whole lot of work to the interior + look and feel. I am glad to see the effort, and many cars parked outside. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Good food during the day time, Service is good if you know the people there you can talk to them for hours. Weekends are packed so if you are having dinner you can stay for the show but it might get crowded. Mandy Juice people!"}
{"text":"Sadly this is pretty much the only option we've got if we want to dance with another guy in the city of Cleveland.  

The setup in this bar is frustrating, the round dance floor stage that takes up more space than needed kills me.  The tables on the floor near the stage make it impossible to dance in that area, so you've gotta get up on the stage and hope you don't fall.  

The music is pretty good, drinks are made very strong.  

The biggest negatives for this club are how long the drag show.. well drags on for, and the crowd that is slowly becoming more and more lesbian and underage kids.  

Thursday nights are a great night in terms of special drink's, Long Island for 3 bucks or flavored for 4 bucks."}
{"text":"This place was fun. A place to dance with a very low DB factor.  Stiff drinks no pun intended. Restroom conversations were very different.

Good music, a little on the euro side. Did not have to worry much about the girl or her mom. I kind of thought this may be a gay bar ,just saying."}
{"text":"This unfortunetly is the best gay bar in Cleveland. If you enjoy being around a lot of people, then Bounce is a good bet. They have the best music, and the bar is always getting remodeled and kept up. 

The staff is disgustingly rude. You wait forever for a drink, and then the bartenders take all of 10 seconds to make it. Handing you a glass that quickly becomes sticky from having half of it slide down the outside. I've also had drinks here that were barely mixed, or the alcohol content varied greatly because attention was not paid to what they were doing. 

I would reccomend tipping, but only if you plan on ordering from that bartender again. If you don't, he will suddenly not notice you, or your drink will be weak. 

The people who go to Bounce are generally on the younger side. There are also a great deal of lesbians and older men as well.

The club itself is always busy during the drag shows, but people file out almost the second that's over and out into \"Union Station.\" 

All in all I always have fun there, but if your going to go to a bar to drink then I wouldn't reccomend Bounce."}
{"text":"Good job Cleveland, I was impressed with your gay bar. Bounce is connected to the Union Cafe, essentially they're one. We entered in through the Union Cafe- very nice set up. Clean, spacious, video screens and seating. Large bar which made it easy to find a spot to stand to make eye contact with the bartender and get a drink. The other part of the establishment, Bounce, is connected at the back of the cafe. They have a large dance area with two levels; the lower level is a circular stage and the upper is a wrap around stage that looks down on the circular one. If you're into top 40 dance songs, this is definitely the place for you. We had a great time going between the two spaces- and not to mention our drinks were strong, we were please to say the least! If you're in Cleveland and looking for a gay club, I'd recommend this one. Not amazing, but definitely had everything that you'd look for in a club that is meant to cater to both gay men and lesbians. I'll go back if I am ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Probably the busiest gay bar in Cleveland, but that's not saying much.  

The good:

The food is outstanding, far above standard bar fare.  The menu is diverse.  Drinks are strong.  The place is close to downtown, freeways, and other entertainment venues.  Usually a fair amount of business on Friday and Saturday nights.  Large outdoor patio area with heaters and furniture.  The Crowd is about 25 percent gay men and 25 percent lesbians, and 50 percent straight women who accompany the gay men.  If you want to pick up straight women, this is your place.  

The bad:  

This place is cold.  It's cold in the winter.  It's cold in the summer.  It's always freezing cold inside.  You could refrigerate food inside this place it's so cold.  The neighborhood is sketchy.  Walk outside in a group for safety due to beggars, homeless people, hookers, drug dealers, and thieves lurking in the area...or simply carry a firearm and be ready to use it.  Don't leave anything laying around unattended inside the club, or it will be promptly stolen.  The place is still generally dirty and run-down, despite efforts to fix it up recently.  The bathroom smells like a dead cat.  The drag shows \"drag\" on for what seems like several academic semesters.  The drag shows pretty much consist of burly men wearing women's clothes, shouting obscenities into a microphone at the top of their lungs. 

Bottom line is...if you wanna party hard, loud and dirty, this is the place!  Just don't have your expectations set too high."}
{"text":"Sorry guys - one of the big gay destinations in Cleveland is not world-class. If the world were Cleveland then, yeah... it's maybe a 4 1/2 star joint, but since the world is New York City... well, you get my drift. The set-up is nice, however. Two sections: an outer \"bar\" for mingling and/or watching really gay music videos (if you have no interest in speaking with the crowd) and a room to the side where you can dance - on a stage, on the floor, on the bar... whatever.

So what's wrong with this place? It's the vibe. It has that often sinister teenaged gay boy vibe, except everyone has it, especially the older guys. Also, I almost got raped by this disgusting older guy who was too muscular to consider human..."}
{"text":"I've been here a million times, so I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed it. 

As a fag hag, I enjoy that there's a diverse crowd of people at Bounce/Union Station. Whether you're gay, straight, or anything in-between, there's a place for you at Bounce. 

I particularly enjoy the drag shows on the weekends. Saturday night is lesbian night and features a couple drag kings, too (and nearly naked female go go dancers, if you're into that sort of thing). 

Maybe I'm getting to be an old lady, but the crowd seems to be getting younger and younger at Bounce. Maybe because it's more of a dance club? So if you're looking for a place to watch an amazing show or to shake it, this is the place for you. If you want a nice chill place to spend the evening, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has taken a continual downturn in the past years.  I used to love it, but now I only go if some of my friends insist.  The bathrooms smell foul (that's an understatement), and there are no doors on the men's stalls.  Sadly, the place is completely run down.  It only packs a crowd on Saturday night's anymore, and it's a huge lesbo fest.  Nothing against the ladies, but I remember the days gorgeous men flocked to this place years ago and had jam packed drag shows Thursday-Sunday nights.  Now the place has closed a couple nights a week, looks dirty, and lacks great entertainment aside from the few regular queens who have stuck around over the years.  The drinks are still cheap and big, but my amount of attendance has declined dramatically over the last year, and I always end up leaving by 1am because in all honesty, I get bored and disgusted.  Not to mention, it is filled with people 18-20 year olds who, (in my valley girl voice), \"think it's so fetch to be at a gay bar\"....please...

p.s. you can count on seeing many of the tired and clichéd groups of straight women there for a bachelorette party, really?!?"}
{"text":"Friday nights are not so busy and the DJ definitely doesn't like to play any R&B or Pop or take any requests so don't waste your breathe... Saturday nights are a lot of fun and gets pretty crowded! The DJ plays a mixture of songs from different genres to everyone's liking and keeps the crowd dancing.  Drag shows are very entertaining and a lot of fun!!!! Tipping is basically a must! Also, the dancers on the bars look good and have fantastic bodies! Don't forget to tip them!"}
{"text":"If you want to see every stereotype of gay men displayed in front of you, go to Bounce. I guess some so called 'fag hags' enjoy these public displays of obnoxiousness, but as a grown man, I feel I've endured more than enough of them. The crowd is usually a combination of twinky club kidz and lesbians. Allegedly drugs are a problem here, although I have never seen any. The stalls in the men's room have no doors (get the picture?). If this is your kinda place, have a blast."}
{"text":"Everyone is wasted definitely a wild night. Mostly gay white men and they play top 40/techno never tried the food but always a fun night of dancing and drinking when i go to bounce."}
{"text":"Bounce is one of the most entertaining places in Cleveland. The drink selection is ridiculously extensive and the prices are honestly fair. Throw in an amazing staff and you've got one hell of a place. This is all coming from a straight man. So man up and get your ass down there. Say wuddup to Jeff. That dude busts his ass for his customers and makes some mean drinks."}
{"text":"been here a few times now. it's always been crowded. there's always a bunch of lesbians. the music was never very good because they are trying to cater to such a diverse crowd, techno then hip hop, etc. The dancefloor is kind of awkward and I guess it's two clubs in one. I will say it's the place to be on Friday and Sat night."}
{"text":"Always a good time at Bounce! They've created a better menu. Drinks are yummy and the people watching is even better! Drink up birches!"}
{"text":"Dont sleep on Bounce Night Club. The drag shows are great and the food and drinks are delicious!! Check them out!"}
