{"text":"Updated:
This place started out great, but tried too hard to become a hotspot hookah bar and started slipping on the food quality and freshness. A true bummer, because it used to be really good food. I kept going back to try again, but had several bad experiences back to back. I hope they get it together again!

Previous review:
I like it here! This place does a speedy business during lunch, when all the Uptownians come clad in their blue button downs and tight black pencil skirts. I like the flavors, I love the price, and I like that one box lunch makes enough leftovers for a solid cold lunch the next day. The hummus is really good, anything else chickpea so far has been great as well (after 5+ visits), and the meats and rice are pretty consistent. All in all, an Uptown win!"}
{"text":"I am 99.5% sure this place gave me meningitis. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. I went here three fridays ago and ended up being hospitalized the following weekend. My symptoms started showing late Wednesday night/early Thursday morning the week after I visited (5-6 days after smoking the hookah). It was a horrible experience but what was even more horrible was not knowing how I could have possibly gotten it when I only went out in public once in the week before I got sick. That one time was on a date where I was smoking hookah here, which is why I am so certain the cause was from a hookah that was not cleaned properly. Places like hookah bars make it extremely easy to pass diseases and illnesses around due to the nature of the experience (which I understand that I put my own self at risk) but because of this, bars need to follow strict guidelines for sanitation. I'm afraid this bar fell quite short and now I have some hefty hospital bills to pay for this first date of mine (luckily the same date was there holding my hand in the ER)"}
{"text":"I love Istanbul. I've been to plenty hookah bars in Charlotte but the food is good here and they have strong drinks! I love this little ally way!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying there hookah from this place staff seemed unprofessional and didnt take care of the customers like they should. We waited for over a half hour waiting for our hookah, when they came back around they had no idea what we ordered and didn't have any idea where our hookah went or who had our credit card all around a bad experience. WILL NOT RETURN"}
{"text":"yummy!  I just had lunch here.  It was delicious and served quickly.   It is located in an \"arcade\" of many small restaurants near downtown Charlotte, NC where everyone in your conference group or business can find what they want.  Then you can all eat together in the open air space between the restaurants."}
{"text":"I got the Doner Kebab - a generous portion of street meat severved over jasmine rice along with cucumber and tomato sauce...with it you get two sides (I got green beans and a forgettable salad). Decor is sparce - blame that on Latta Arcade space...was very clean and I peeked in on the Hookah bar next door and there were a bunch of bean bag chairs in the hookah room...so I guess it's ready for business. All in all - good value/experience for lunch...kind of a poor man's Kabob Grill (not a knock on Metropolitan - it's better than most downtown lunch spots). Also my buddy got a chicken kabob on a turkish pita - huge sandwich that comes with one side....very reasonably priced for downtown."}
{"text":"This was a really cool little hookah bar we discovered in downtown Charlotte. Really well priced and high quality hookahs and tobacco as well as very friendly service. The turkish orchid drink was also very interesting (tasted somewhat like warm milk with a hint of custard-like flavor). The only gripe I have about this place is the uncomfortable home-made furniture with pillows and bean-bag chairs stuffed with styrofoam peanuts (?). Still I'd recommend at least checking it out once if you've never smoked a hookah before."}
{"text":"I definitly recommend the sautéed chicken. Food was great and the yogurt sauce on the meal was perfect."}
{"text":"Had the doner kebab for lunch today. I don't think it was anything spectacular - the rice was too mushy for my taste and although the description reads beef AND lamb, I only saw one or two slices of beef. The lamb was the typical gyro meat and could have been more soft, in my opinion. All in all, the portion was big but I didn't finish the meal."}
{"text":"Total disaster on a Wednesday at 12:30pm.  They clearly can not handle more than a couple people in there at a time.  There were maybe 5 people waiting in line and maybe 5 more who already were waiting for to go orders.  They were out of pitas, lamb, eggplant.  They forgot sauce on my sandwich which came out about 10 minutes after ordering, which still was before a few people who were already waiting on their food once I walked in. They also didn't have containers with separate sections so they just layered the bottom of it with my side of beans on placed my wrap on top of the beans."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or even dinner. Some dishes may be a little on the spicy side so if you like bland food this may not be the place for you. 

Highly recommend the number 3 which is sautéed chicken over rice. Very tasty and a great portion size. All their sides are good like chickpeas and try the kisir. 

Also they have places to sit upstairs but much better enjoyed sitting over at Romare Bearden park which is close by."}
{"text":"Delicous.  Don't let the three stars fool you.  I can't speak for the service but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Good hookah bar. Decent selection. Outside seating is limited and it is shared space with other bars in the court. Upstairs is really dark. FYI its brevard ct not brevard st."}
{"text":"Was very very slow service. Like I watched a whole 15-20 minutes on Sports Center. The food was all right, not amazing."}
{"text":"Nice quiet weekday chill spot! Great services & wingsssss OMG 10!!!"}
{"text":"The inside of this place is shady.. and not at all comfortable.  It's cheap (and tacky) interior are a serious buzz kill.  If you're going there for a hookah, be sure you sit outside.  It's also pertinent to mention that their sanitation score is 88.5 - you've gotta have some serious violations to get a score that low!  Lastly, some of their servers are outright MEAN.  And they don't know how to make a good drink.

The only reason I give this place a two instead of a one, is because of their hookahs.  They're reasonably priced, and if you get one that's not working properly they will take their time to fix it for you.

Otherwise, I would recommend you get your hookah craving from Crave.  Much classier spot."}
{"text":"Please do not waste your time. I am warning you. It is nothing like the website or a restaurant at all. It is merely a store front that has some meat in the back. Although there was a menu with several options we were only given two. They were ill prepared for dinner service but I can imagine the lunch is any better. I ordered the doner kebab on turkish bread and received it on a wrap. After returning the wrap I then received the flavorless meat on soggy bread with no sauce. It was not even edible. I was happy that they did not charge for this mess however they made their money off of a beer they charged us $5 for. The worst part is the website that is so deceiving. We were served food in styrofoam! Sitting in an alley with broken glass and a stereo playing bad music loudly. If you want to experience a little bit of Turkey, I guess the only option you have is to go to Turkey."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to say the least was on a trolley tour of uptown charlotte for my Birthday the \"French quarter\" was one of the stops so I had already been reading reviews of this place and wanting to check it out. Place is rather small has a couple rooms upstairs and they seem to have a pretty good drink selection I didn't buy anything. The reason being is because of the rude bartender, service was so terrible I left! Me and some friends were literally standing at the bar for about 5-10 mins and no one else was ordering a drink so when a group came In after us i was a bit confused about why she didn't take our order. So one of my friends ask is there a line or something? In this rude tone she goes \" yep it's right over there don't you see it?\" We all took offense and left that's ridiculous not to even acknowledge us standing right at the bar with no wait so we left. Will not ever go back!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and each time the hookah flavors were terrible and hookah itself this past time was crusty. Around the hose. Only giving a two star instead of one because staff is nice and drinks are strong."}
{"text":"I love the setting.. it's in a little alley way..as a previous yelper described.. it's very Parisian! 

We were greeted with a luke warm welcome.. once our actual waitress came out to take our order, the service really went up. 
The hookah didn't hit well at first, but eventually we got it. 

Some strange stuff was happening when we first arrived...seems like a popular hangout for teens. When we sat down upstairs (by the way they have an upstairs if you're like us and are completely oblivious haha) this group of kids were upstairs playing a weird ass game where you rock paper scissors then smack the crap out of each other. Yeah, no. 
The lights were also super bright and the tv was going all white noise. The waitress fixed both of those and turned the room into a nice chill atmosphere to hookah. 

Other than the hit-show, we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Came into Charlotte to see and old friend...ended our night at this spot.  Drink selection is minimal, and the hookah is more commercial than good quality.  Ambiance is an A and the people there are very friendly!
Ok spot to hang out with friends...get and upstairs room to really kick back!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and ordered the Mediterranean sampler.  It has hummus, falafel, grape leaves and eggplant \"salad\".  Ummm...the falafel taste store bought, the hummus and grape leaves were average and the eggplant salad stuff was - omg, I cant even describe it.  Its cold and mushy and really spicy and has like this tobacco after taste.  It had to be the worst tasting thing ive tried in many years.  I couldn't do it, i had to throw it all out and I HATE wasting my money.  Update - I had four people at work try this eggplant salad stuff and they all agreed that it is the devils handiwork and should be exorcised immediately.  And it smells like a dern ashtray!!!!!"}
{"text":"This service wasnt rude but it was cold. 
The rice was the same as uncle Ben's converted rice,  that is if it wasn't uncle Ben's. 
The spicy white beans literally tasted like seasoned canned pork and beans including the sweetness. 
The hummus was okay but really loose like flavored tahani. 
The kofta was very very salty, could not make it any other spices"}
{"text":"Istanbul was ok. Nothing amazing. Its a hookah lounge with bar food. The prices for everything were pretty on point. I will concur with other yelpers the staff members were a bit rude. We were talking about what we wanted to order and in the middle the bartender interrupted us and yelled \"so you wanna start a tap or? \" I wasn't even at the point if I knew if I wanted to dine there or not.

Fast forward we decided to sit outside. I never knew that there was an upstairs lounge. The outside seating/ alleyway type thing was weird because there are only like 3 tables on their side of the alley. The other patio table belong to the other establishments and we were told that in order to take a seat at their tables they would like for you to shop with that particular business. Thats not the issue. It would have been nice to have been introduced to the upstairs at Istanbul.

All together it was cool because the outside had lots of characters roaming around. The hookah was cool and the replacement coals came regularly. The food was also quick which was a plus. The minus was that it was all frozen bar food, deep fried and served to you. With that being said, this hookah bar and its surrounding is more club/party like. If you are looking for that. By all means it will serve what you are looking for."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having a good meal considering I love Mediterranean food in general. First off it's false advertisement. There food is the farthest from authentic. The kabobs tasted like it was marinated in salt. The falafel was nothing like I ever ate before. Just terrible. The rice was good but that's about it. And there shepherd salad was not at all a shepherd salad. There sign says \" taste of Istanbul.\" My friend who is from that city says they don't even have half the things there that they had on there menu. Definitely not what I was expecting. Try at your own risk ;) good luck!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place - definitely plan to go back. Drinks were pretty cheap, and they have hookah until midnight (I believe?). Good place to grab a drink with a friend and catch up... that being said - this is not a super crazy place where you're going to see tons of people."}
{"text":"This restaurant  has the freshest ingredients, homemade bread and a great selection of wine. Their prices are more than reasonable with a good atmosphere. It is the ONLY good Mediterranean place uptown.  They have a cozy hookah lounge upstairs along with outdoor seating. I have never had a bad item as everything is so fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance. But the Hookah I got (lemon mint) was pretty much dead - lacked flavor and punch. Not to mention, we asked for water and never got that either."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for CIAA and decided to check this place out for a lil shisha before getting into this weekend's festivities. For starters, the customer service is amazing. From the minute I walked in, the hostess/server was very attentive. She directed me upstairs and my drink and hookah was out in no time. The music is very mellow and perfect for this atmosphere (reggae). The happy hour (5p-8p) shisha is $10 and the flavor list is pretty extensive. I ordered some cheesesticks to munch on and they were nice, hot and gooey- just how i like 'em. If you're looking for a spot to kick back and relax, this is it! #exhaaaaaaaaale"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from the NYC area, we relocated here 2 years ago and we miss the vibe of the architecture and multi ethnic varieties of food. This felt like home to us! It is located in a courtyard of Brownstone style buildings and the mood was very intimate. Food was good and the hookah was fun. Portions of food could have been a bit bigger but the experience is more about the hookah and environment. We really needed a date night and this was worth the wait. We will for sure come back again. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Great prices, wonderful spot downtown to get away for a bit. Vanessa was incredibly attentive with replacing the coals and making sure everything was okay my way. Definitely coming back! And I'm picky with my hookah lounges  great job"}
{"text":"I came for an early lunch with my husband. I ordered lamb kebobs with hummus and kafir (eggplant). I asked the cashier what she recommended so that's how I chose the kafir. It was delicious! Totally not something you order on looks, but ridiculously good (think guacamole: it ain't pretty but when done right, it's awesome). The lamb was rich and flavorful. The hummus was original. Maybe a spinach hummus? Made a little coarser than perhaps you might be used to. I liked its originality. They gave me a little warm pita but I def could've used more. The rice was bland but not terrible. 

This is a grab and go kinda place. They use that godawful styrofoam (why is this stuff still legal??) we ate outside in the courtyard, which is quite nice. I think they had one tall top table inside. 

If you are in downtown Charlotte, this would make a nice place to pick up lunch. My only real complaint would be the lack of proper eating utensils but I'm guessing the place is too small to host a dishwasher."}
{"text":"This hookah bar is amazing! They do half priced hookahs and have drink specials. I love all the star buzz flavors and the location of the bar. They even carry some snacks. They are great about replacing coals! They could replace some of the sofas that are broken but overall love going to smoke here!"}
{"text":"I remember my disappointment with the closing of Sofram Grill in Tower Place on HWY 51. Call it snobby if you wish but I thought Sofram failed solely because suburbanites are generally too afraid to try anything more exotic than Olive Garden. Had it been uptown or one of the hipper, more cosmopolitan inner neighborhoods things might have been different. Now with the success of Metropolitan Cafe uptown, I'm beginning to think my hunch was right. It's great to see Metropolitan is thriving. The vindication is just a bonus.

I went in for a (very) late lunch; around 5pm. Restaurants generally aren't at their best way after lunch and before dinner because what you're served is often hours old. While my kebab wasn't as hot and fresh as it could've been, it was flavorful and contained a very generous serving of meat. An added bonus was that it wasn't dripping with grease as kebabs so often are. I was told it didn't come with a side, which was annoying. Fearing a kebab alone wouldn't satisfy, I ordered the piyaz appetizer, a cold white bean salad with green peppers, red onion and tomatoes in an olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing. Delicious! It was so good and so refreshingly simple I ended up making it myself at home. So it seems not including a side was a blessing in disguise. The piyaz was way healthier and probably tastier than a side of fries could ever be.  

After the meal I couldn't resist ordering a cup of Turkish coffee. You'd do well to do the same. Just a few warnings for those not familiar with Turkish coffee: It's strength is such that NASA is considering using it to fuel manned missions to Mars. It's served hot enough to melt lead. It's thick enough to be used as a personal lubricant in even the staunchest and most repressed conservative bedrooms. Oh, and the grounds form a thick sludge at the bottom of the cup. So let it cool a little, sip it slowly, leave a little at the bottom of the cup and try not to think of santorum. 

I can't wait to give Metropolitan another try at a peak hour. All indications tell me I'll be revising this to give them at least another star."}
{"text":"The hookah there is really not that good, the regular flavors taste awful, the hookahs don't let a good enough draw and they use quick light charcoals, even on the premium hookah. They do not carry Al Fakher tobacco, the premium they sell is Star Buzz which taste like candy. Nice curtains and deco though, and kudos for the Turkish coffee, which ups it to 2 stars."}
{"text":"I go to this place just about once a week for lunch in uptown Charlotte for under $10. I normally get the Doner Chicken over lettuce instead of rice and you must get the hummus, spicy hummus if they have it. Their hummus is my favorite and some of the best in Charlotte. The menu is projected on to the wall, they have a sign with their sides that are made and change daily, you order at the counter, and they give you your food to go even though there are seats upstairs (I've never actually eaten upstairs but I have eaten at their outdoor seating). Quick, easy, and delicious. They have pitas/gyros, salads, and entrees. It gets pretty busy in there sometimes so make sure you check your to go box when you get it. Alex, who normally works the cashier is super friendly and awesome. I'm eating it right now I am already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this Paris-like alley."}
{"text":"Extremely RUDE staff! At the end of the night the night, one of the young ladies came over and all but snatched the hookah off the table. There were multiple tables with hookahs that could have been taken before ours and MULTIPLE tables to clean, in addition to there being a line. She claims she was doing her job, but failed to realize that she was being rude and disrespectful. This place no longer has to worry about receiving my business."}
{"text":"Both food & hookah were ok. We sat outside and service was good. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of Charlotte's best kept secrets. I've been here twice now and had a great time both times. They have a full service bar and large hookah flavor selection on their menu. You can either be sit outside or you can go upstairs to their nice lounge general area where there's couches, a tv and music. They also have two other private rooms that looks like it can seat about 5-8 people comfortably if you wanted to hangout with a bunch of friends. The private rooms don't cost any extra too.

All in all, its a legit hookah spot with great service that won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"It's my first time here. I had the most stupendous time thanks to Jordan. She's is definitely doing the best. All her girls are great. If it wasn't for her i would come back. She is awesome"}
{"text":"First visit last night with the boo. Arrived around 7:30. We were immediately greeted and told that it was hookah happy hour and were given a number and headed upstairs. Found a nice nook by the window and settled in. It took about 10 minutes for our pipe to arrive. 

The Good:
Great music...The Eagles, Bob Marley, Tosh, Sound Garden all mellow and not too loud

Decent Shisha...papaya mango and mint mix they have a higher end grade also

Atmosphere...it was clean, smelled good, younger crowd in the room we were in but they were cool. Bathroom was clean. I informed a server there was no soap in the ladies and they took care of it right away.

Service...Unlike many lounges I've visited, you are not charged extra for a fresh coal and they come around to tap the ash off for you! Servers were very pleasant and didn't bother you but were available if you needed anything. 

Food...we just ordered some wings because we had not eaten all day and they were pretty good. Trust me, I'm from Western NY and I know wings!

Location...It's in the cut and out of the way of the \"Uptown swank\"

The Bad:

Crowd...We didn't go in the other rooms(I think there are 3) but would have liked an older crowd. Right before we left there was a group that came in that did not understand that a hookah lounge does not call for the same volume of speaking as a bar! A etiquette blurb on the menu may be helpful at any lounge. 

Food...would have liked to see some creativity on the menu but that may cause the prices to skyrocket so never mind. 

Overall:
I enjoyed it and will be back. The happy hour is daily from 5-8 $10 hookah. I'd like to try some cocktails on my next visit; maybe the \"Liquid Marijuana.\" It goes with the vibe;)"}
{"text":"I seriously cant find a better place for fresh grilled chicken kebabs in Downtown Charlotte. Local spot, and tasty. Fresh every time. I start to crave it when I'm not in town.

- #6 Chicken Shish Kebab
- Extra cucumber sauce salad on top
- Rice & hummus as my sides"}
{"text":"I go here all the time for lunch.  never been for dinner, but i would imagine the same quality and service.  the food is always very good.  I have had several dishes including the most basic- donor kebab.  also, as several other have commented, the turkish coffee is always great and good pick-me-up for mid day.
Fairly small operation (as many places are in latta arcade) so i wouldn't recommend going with more than 4 people."}
{"text":"Cool place, very busy for a Friday night. Staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. Nice lounge to hangout with friends though. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"During a recent visit to Brevard Court I found this little place that does nothing but drinks and Hookah rentals.  They have a menu book that will most certainly have the flavor you desire.  Honestly, I just let them choose because I don't have a preference but if you do, you're sure to find it I bet.

They give you a number, you go find a seat outside and they will bring the whole setup to you ready to go.  They also service the hookahs with hot coals which is a nice touch.  Our rather large group really enjoyed it and never once had to go searching for our \"waitress\"."}
{"text":"The service was too slow.  The hookah flavor was not good. We had fun at this place earlier but now the place seems to have lost its mojo. Hope we'll have better experience next time!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time freshman year of college,  but in the last few years the nice and quiet atmosphere has turned club like.  It isn't as much fun as it used to be."}
{"text":"nice little hidden gem in the French Quarter. Its a great atmosphere to sit outside, smoke, and people watch. The food is okay, good specials, and the servers are always friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"This is a great stop for lunch. They're relatively quick, they have a diverse menu, and good side options. The tabbouleh, falafel and lamb/beef kabobs are staples for me. Oh, and when I went yesterday the hummus was ON POINT. It must be a new recipe, I don't remember it being so good last time. Might just go back for hummus snacks from now on.."}
{"text":"Staff is hit or miss on setting up the hookah. Have been here twice and the first time the hookah was far too harsh and not fun to smoke but the second time it was great and very smooth."}
{"text":"Had tasty doner kebab and chicken kebab.
Can pick the bread and side.
Full bar - overall good lunch!"}
{"text":"Just bad unfortunately. Went on a Saturday night for the first and LAST time.. It was slightly hard to find because of the construction downtown, but anyways, the seating upstairs was pretty cool in my opinion.. pillows, and ottomans in the seating area. Pretty cool. However, after ordering at \"the\" bar and going upstairs, the hookah took a while to come out. I was enjoying the music (mostly r&b, rap) so I didn't mind as much that the hookah was a tad slow. Upon arrival, the hookah was subpar to say the very least. It was not very flavorful or good.. at all. I also ordered wings while waiting for my hookah.. the wings never came. I admit they got pretty busy after we sat down, but there was no communication with the customers about late hookahs or backed up orders in the kitchen. The staff was rude, they would brush right pass you with hookahs without acknowledging you.. there was no interaction at all. They would bring the hookah, sit it on the table, not say a word to you, and leave. I asked to get our table cleaned because the previous customers left it filthy, and the employee's answer was \"Ummm, ok hold on\" She returned upstairs in our room at least 3 times, not once did she return to wipe our table down. The only friendly and professional employee was the girl on the register who took the orders, and kept the tabs open. She actually apologized for the slow and not so friendly service on behalf all of the employees. Lastly, the ladies bathroom was not in good shape to say the least. I will just keep going to King tut for now on."}
{"text":"Holly Molly! Bar Rescue please help these clowns! What can I say about this horrendous place?! Nothing nice since this is by far one of the worst places that I have been to in this town. From the customer service to the quality of their product and the tacky decorations, this place excels at being atrocious and quite frankly a true disappointment. If someone recommends this place to anyone, they got it hate them, because there's no way in hell I'll recommend this dumpster. Where do I begin? First, the staff is extremely rude. This was my first time visiting since I usually go to Crave and I was actually expecting someone to help us get a table. Instead, the lady was very rude when informing us that we need to find our own table and anything that we request we have to come to the register and order it through her. Even the basics as water, you have to get up and walk to the register to place an order. During this visit I was with a group of people and we decided to asked about the prices for a hookah and she proceeded to give us some of the prices for us to split. Anyway, when she came back with the amount, apparently she was trying to beat us for some more money and when we became aware of what she was doing, she became extremely snappy and condescending to all of us. She was so upset, we never saw her again.  Later when they brought the hookah, it was place on the ground and another waitress rudely informed us \"Can't put it on the table. If it breaks, I'll charged you $25 for the damage\". LMAO! Now, the inside. Very dark, very tacky and the couches? I don't have any back problems, but if you do, don't come here. I got a feeling they got those couches from a dumpster because it felt worn out and to the point I literally sunk into the couch. The food and hookah? Nothing to brag about. Food was small (but cheap) and what was coming out of the hookah was weak. I literally didn't feel anything and quite frankly, I was just blowing smoke. The fries were small and let me not forget, the menu is limited and the desserts are not truly available. Someone in my group order cheese sticks and apparently they didn't have no marinara sauce and only ranch as their option. Plus, the desserts were off limits. Advertised yes, but when we asked for an order they simply said \"we don't have anything to make it with\". And also, I wouldn't recommend eating at this place when they got a score of a 88 for sanitation and that's not a good thing at all. The only highlights of the night was all of us leaving and the view of uptown. It's crazy how they have a prime location to have a successful and thriving business, but everything about it is nothing but a headache and regrets. I'm suspecting clowns are running this establishment, because everything about it is laughable.  If someone recommends you this place, I'm pretty sure you have done an amazing job at pissing them off, because there's no way I'll ever recommend this place to anyone and that includes my enemies. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMPSTER!"}
{"text":"Cute little hookah bar/restaurant in Charlotte's \"French Quarter\". Waitress Holly is amaze-balls as she handled my group of 15 lunatics with ease. A hidden gem in CLT with first come first serve seating and great atmosphere. There are three rooms to choose from and a long list of flavors to select."}
{"text":"Some of the bad reviews for this place are a little absurd. I guess I don't rate on service and decor as much but freal, if you're eating dinner at the Latta Arcade and want to be pampered you've got another thing coming.

Anyways, my Iskander Kebab was pretty good. It's Kebab meat on top of pita covered in tomato sauce and yogurt. I thought the yogurt in particular was pretty solid and while the meat was not mind blowing, the portions were generous enough to make up for it."}
{"text":"If there's a choice to choose a zero star I'll choose it for sure the worst café I ever seen the blond waitress so rude I didn't see her smiling and it was our first time  visiting this place we drove all the way from FL to smoke hookah when we told her our ages more than 18 so we can smoke she looked at us in rude way and said '' whatever '' like what the fuck is not a good service at all so please don't go to there it's very very bad place to spend and waste your time there"}
{"text":"I thought this place might replace the spot in my heart for Casablanca but alas! I was mistaken. While the food was pretty good overall, the rice did not match the cuisine and therefore single-handedly tainted the whole experience. It was like minute rice out of a microwave. It was definitely not Mediterranean. Anyway, it's not a huge deal ultimately (I still have Casablanca!!!). It is obvious their main attraction is hookah and since I don't smoke, I'm not sure that I'll be going back."}
{"text":"WOW!  I am in LOVE with this place!!!  Let's start off with the awesomest part - they will let you taste a side to see if you like it before you commit to it!!  That's customer service, especially in a place that has food that some people have never tried before.  I assume they'll only do that when they aren't slam packed busy, but it's worth a shot to ask even if it is.

Lamb kebabs were awesome.  Very very tasty - the spices were so delicious, it almost didn't need the sauces (kinda thin, though - I could have stood for them to be a little more... meaty. ha!).  They give you a choice of a tomato sauce or cucumber sauce to go over the meat - I got both, but I think the next time I'll just get the tomato - the tanginess compliments the meat very well.

You get a pretty decent amount of food for $9, 2 kebabs over a generous helping of rice, and 2 sides.   They have a couple of tables outside and a cute little upstairs part that you can sit at to enjoy your food - and BONUS - there is also a little hookah lounge upstairs with couches and TVs - I'm all about the hookah (no funny business though, straight up peaches and cream tobacco, lol).

I can't wait to come back here and partake in some hookah and relax - that's my kind of date night.

And maybe next time I'll try a GIGANTIC baklava... they looked so gooey and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place if you are tired of same old uptown lunch. I had the doner sandwich with green bean salad on the side for $7 which is pretty reasonable for the size. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, this was not my favorite place, and it's not even a place I would choose to return to.  Yes, the doner kabobs were good (but not great), but service was SLOW (even though we were the only ones in there), and the lady making our plates did not pay attention when my friend and I asked for no red sauce in our wraps.  Sodas and water are only available by the bottle, and they are expensive.  This was the worst $9 lunch I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Food is great, so is the service.  If they would do coconut husk coals I'd bump it up a notch."}
{"text":"6 years ago, when I first moved to Charlotte, this place was a staple. Staff was professional, food was decent, and i loved the hookah. The past couple of times I have gone, my experiences have not been the best. Last night was by far the worst. I was there with a party of 6, so a friend and I each ordered a hookah. Both the same flavor. The hookah I ordered did not pull properly and the flavor was very faint. I alerted the waitress downstairs and she stated that she would come help. 29 minutes later, I had to elicit her assistance again in which she told me that she was told that it would be extra to get a new hookah. She stated that someone could come upstairs and try to fix it. I agreed and no one came. I then asked for my money back, it had been 2 hours and the hookah sat there and everyone seemed to ignore my request until the gentleman helped me and stated that I should in fact receive a full refund. He is the only reason why there are two stars. I used to love this place. I am very disappointed in the lack of customer service displayed by the waitresses."}
{"text":"I don't typically write yelp reviews, but the food here was awful and I don't want someone to have to experience what I did. I ordered the Falafel Salad.

1) they were out of tomatoes at 11:30am. Not sure how that is even possible, especially at a Turkish restaurant.

2) I was told to get the Falafel salad out of all the salads, because the Falafel was soooo good. It was awful. It was super mushy and some of the worst I have had.

I actually had to throw away my lunch after about 5 bites. Guess I will have to go get something else now."}
{"text":"I lived in Germany for almost 4 years and loved eating doner kebabs regularly.  Since I've been back in the states I've looked all over for a place that serves this delicious meal.  When I found Metropolitan Cafe I was excited to see that they served the doner kebab.  My excitement was short lived though.  I wouldn't even call this a doner kebab.  It was more like a mediocre gyro at best.  I'll keep looking and won't be going back here again.  I did eat a delicious gyro right across the alley from them though."}
{"text":"I love Istanbul the only reason for me it doesn't get a 100 is due to the fact they don't play music really. The drinks are very good I love the liquid marijuana. they also serve food. the atmosphere is very laid back the space is within the French quarter so there's other bars in the breeze way. The stairs to get tot he top are narrow so be ware but its a super cool environment. Its a great place to go as a couple and relax with some of the best hookah flavors ever or with your girls to chat a catch up."}
{"text":"Fourth try is a must!!

I ordered a Felafal salad without yogurt sauce and feta cheese (because I have dairy allergies) and added hummus and extra falafel to the order. I didn't check the order, but when I sat down to eat my lunch, sure enough there was feta cheese all over it, and despite being charged extra for both hummus and falafel, they were missing. 

So, I walked over and asked the girl behind the counter politely that my order is wrong. So she takes it back to the kitchen, comes back in 5 minutes and hands me the exact same order!!! She didn't even do anything with it. But, because I learned from experience I checked it there and then and told her that she needs to fix it. To which, she takes back inside and this time brings back almost accurate order, except hummus was missing. I point that out, she takes it back and adds hummus and brings it back. As I said, took only 4 tries to get it right!

All this, without even a word of apology! 

(Wish the food wasn't nearly as good as it is or I wouldn't even contemplate going back).

Terrible service!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken donner salad for lunch and it turned out to be the worst salad I have ever had. Deep fried bits and pieces of chicken ( probably leftover from the previous day) on lettuce. Had so much oil from chicken all over the salad and it tasted horrible. Never going there again"}
{"text":"Place is a perfect chill lounge hookah spot with the best music ( The only place I know in CLT that plays indie rap). Drink pricing isn't too shabby. I've brought friends that loved the wings. The plae is often packed out, so if you can get you and your party a spot you should have no issue. The staffing is constantly checking to make your taken care of."}
{"text":"really cool hookah spot! It's not trendy or pretentious and you don't have to call 3 days ahead to get a table... which is handy because we're usually downtown in cute shoes before we figure out exactly what to do and where we're going. 

anyway, there's happy hour & cool people & and the food smelled DELICIOUS

i vote go, early - late - & often"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time on this place. They have something called a \"Hookah Wait\" which means and I quote \" You pay for your hookah now but I'm not sure when you will get it. It could take up to a hour and a half\". If all of your hookahs are in use and you dont have hookahs available you shouldn't take someone's order and make them wait 1 hour. Service was horrible, they have only one bartender that has to fix drinks and take orders. Waste of time."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch twice now at Metropolitan Cafe which is located in the Latta Arcard across from the Plaza.  Cafe is streching it quite bit unless cafe is Turkish for little dive hole in the wall place.  If you are looking for fine dining, even casual dining look elsewhere.  Cosmopolitan Cafe is really a get it and go place.  With that said, it has been busy both times I have been there.  No place really to sit inside, but there are 3 or 4 tables outside.

They serve Turkish cuisine, mainly kebabs and some vegetarian offerings.  The kebab thing threw me off the first time.  I ordered the döner kebab the first time around.  It wasn't meat on a stick like I expected.  It looked exactly like gyro meat to me.  So I googled \"döner kebab\" and up popped tons of sites.  Döner kebab is literally means \"rotating roast,\" and it looks just like a gyro roast.  I don't know whether it is cooked on site or elsewhere and brought, but it was good.  The entrees come with two sides and rice.  The sides are kisir, which to me looked like a version of couscous, which is made with bulgur, parsley and tomato paste.  It was also very, very tasty.  Other sides where a green bean salad, white bean salad, grilled eggplant salad, and cabbage salad.  They also had hot sides such as steam vegetables, which is what I got.  The veggies were way overcooked but still tasted good.  The rice was not just plain rice, but was creamy like a very thick risotto.

The second time I went there I got the döner kebab wrap which comes with one side.  The wrap is just that döner kebab in a choice of wraps (white, whole wheat & spinach) along with other toppings.  For my side I got the white bean salad which was very good.  You can take any of he sides and make a combo vegetarian wrap which seemed to be very popular.  The prices are reasonable, $6.99 for the döner kebab entree with 2 sides & $5.99 for the wrap.  The owner & staff are very friendly and keep the line moving.  Not much to look at, but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"If you look at my reviews I usually use Yelp to promote places in a positive light.  This place is terrible, and so bad I have to share. The place has cheap decor, I ordered just some fries because nothing else was within my diet.  It seemed like a half order with terrible presentation.  We ordered four drinks and three of them Mojitos.  The bartender has no freaking idea how to make one and it was so overly sweet we asked for something else.  When she delivered them she was sloppy and short, then when we returned them even worse.  We apologized and even said we are good tippers but just want a good drink.  She was snappy and rude about her mistake.  You don't put sour mix in a Mojito, specially half way up the glass.  We moved outside because inside was so bad.  The weather was nice so that helped but overall the experience was so bad I would never, ever go back.  Even the hookah we got didn't work and they had to grab another.  Bad drinks, bad food, bad decor, then terrible service.  Don't go."}
{"text":"This may be my new obsession! I came here before going out for CIAA. It is a hidden gem. Don't pay to park in the lot at night! I came during happy hour (everyday 5-8) and got the star buzz flavor Cactus Breeze for $10. It was delicious! The server was Holly who was amazing. The overall ambiance was relaxed but still classy; there was a very diverse group once it started to get crowded. I didn't order food but I got a good drink for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience there on Wednesday night so I went back on Sunday. This rude, tall, thin chick literally came and picked up my hookah right at closing at 10pm to take it to the back. When I asked what she was doing, she said were closed and I'm taking the hookah and then threatened me not to disconnect the pipe from the bowl. SUPER RUDE.  GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS A WARNING and they wouldn't have any issues."}
{"text":"This place is taking advantage of the fact that it's one of few \"ethnic\" restaurants in the area and people seem to be mystified by the glowing lanterns inside. The \"meat\" in the döner wrap, if it can even be called meat, is over salted and tastes fresh...out of the microwave. Real döner has shaved meat off of a huge rotating slab. It's a crime. I hope a legit Turkish place opens and puts this establishment to shame. They should stick to hookah and drinks."}
{"text":"I had to downgrade Istanbul's rating to a 2.5 because of our last couple of experiences which dealt with coal replacement, they take forever and bring coals up according to the server's convenience despite customer request. We came in yesterday around midnight for a late night hookah sesh, it was not packed compared to other Saturday nights we've been in. After a while, we asked for a coal replacement and a beer from one of the servers who was bringing another customer their hookah. She said she'll get it started and bring it up. 5 minutes go by, another server brings up the beer and asked her if our coal change was coming soon, she assured us it was. 20 minutes go by, a third server brings up someone water and we ask for a coal replacement again. 30+ minutes go by, still no coals. My boyfriend had to go downstairs and ask twice. Finally after 45 minutes have passed from when we initially asked for a coal replacement and our hookah was completely out, one of the servers came out with coal replacements for everyone 25 minutes before closing. Not cool considering they rip the hookah away from you exactly at 2am. I was kinda pissed that they took out coals at their convenience, we asked so many times. Its just bad service. Especially since there were only a handful of groups still at the hookah lounge. 

I am not ashamed to say I didn't leave a tip, I wrote a little note on our receipt explaining why they didn't receive a tip as well. I never not tip, that says something."}
{"text":"I don't know why Metro's gotten such bad reviews. Every time I'm here there's always a line. I mustn't be the only person who likes this place? 

My first take at Turkish. While I can't really tell you how authentic it is, I can attest that everything's pretty good. Whether it's the doner, the meatballs, the chicken doner, to the lentils and chickpeas, yumm chickpeas. Every single item on my plate is licked clean. 

So back to the Turkish thing. As stated, I don't know how authentic it truly is and forgive my ignorance, but the food is very similar and tastes just like gyros, meats and vegetable sides in that general region."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food/drink, but the hookah was a lot of fun. We got the coconut flavor and sat outside on a Friday night. Between the baseball game at BB&T and the soccer games playing at the nearby bars, it was a fun atmosphere (minus the vagrants wandering through the alley harassing people)."}
