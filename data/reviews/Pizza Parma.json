{"text":"This has been my go-to pizza place for years now---I'm a fan! Basic quick pizza, but if you do pick-up, it's a great deal. I usually get feta cheese and a veggie and have never been dissatisfied."}
{"text":"How any one could bring themselves to eat here is astounding. The places are dirty, the food is bad, and the prices are too high. This is a cookie cutter pizza of low quality, low character, and minimal emphasis on cleanliness. Never again...."}
{"text":"We just paid $43 for the worst food I've ever eaten. We ordered two pizzas and two dozen wings. The delivery took over an hour. The pizzas were over cooked, cold and brown.   One order of wings was overcooked, chewy and had bbq sauce splashed on the top of the wings only.  The other order was edible but cold. I wish I would have read the reviews first. We ordered because of the coupons delivered in the PennySaver. I wouldn't eat this food again if it were free."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but i was annoyed that the delivery guy made me go down to hotel lobby to get the pizza.  There are no restrictions at the hotel forcing this.  Will choose a different place for delivery in the future.  Delivery means come to you, not meet me half way."}
{"text":"I will never order from another pizza place again. Every single time I order on the phone or in person, the staff is always friendly, efficient, and now, they remember my fiancé and I - by name - and treat us both fantastically. Pizza Parma is run like a family owned, local restaurant that treats its loyal customers with care and respect, while never failing to make jokes and poke fun for a smile. And most importantly, the food is perfect, always fresh, hot and ready on time. Delivery is super fast and they even climb 2 flights of stairs to bring our food to our front door. I love these guys"}
{"text":"I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.  But their pizza was remarkably terrible.  Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \"personal\" pie, costs $7 and is 7\" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \"small,\" which is 10\". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.  There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.  The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \"I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\" pizza is, and started eating.  Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \"well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \"it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\"  I ate three out of the six \"slices.\" (One sixth of a 10\" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.  Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.  Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.  I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Needed a quick dinner during the holiday rush. We stopped in Parma only because we were in the area. We were greeted by a very pleasant gentleman. He obviously knows about customer service!  The pizza was excellent!  Great crust, very cheesy but not greasy.  Will definitely go back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I've gotten the buffalo wings here and the first time they were a little rubbery, but I realized it was because they wrapped them up in foil before they put them in the styrofoam container. They just kept steaming . The next time I ordered them, I asked if they could package them differently so that they would remain crisp. Although she said nobody had complained about it before, the woman who answered the phone went out of her way to figure out how best to keep them crisp. They ended up wrapping the whole styrofoam container in foil which did the trick. I really appreciate businesses that are willing to listen to customers even if it's the first time they've heard what they're saying. That's all I've ever ordered here and I'm sure to have them again and maybe try some of the salads."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered Pizza Parma for a night in and we both got pasta and cheesy breadsticks.   First, the pasta was barely cooked and drenched in garlic, so much so that my friend had to rinse it off. The marinara pasta was overcooked and caked in cheese.   Second, the cheesy breadsticks were barely cooked and you could tell the dough was not cooked because it was chewy.   Third, I have been extremely ill (food poisoning like symptoms) for two hours and am barely able to keep anything down including water. I would advise people to avoid feeling like this!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large pepperoni and gyro. Delivery was quick for a Saturday night in the rain. I unwrapped the gyro and was very happy to see gyro meat that was freshly sliced (from an actual spit), and pita that was nicely toasted. Pizza Parma's tzatziki (cucumber sauce) was a little thin and runny, but the flavor was good. The pizza was well composed with small, crisp rounds of pepperoni evenly covering the surface. The cheese and sauce on the pie was balanced nicely and not too saucy or cheesy.  Crust was quite thin, not too bubbly or voluminous. All in all I was very pleased with my Pizza Parma experience. The pizza I had tonight was tasty and a little above average but the gyro was a true delight."}
{"text":"Pizza is super yummy---the cheese is out of this world. Best pizza in town, hands down. I wish they would change their fries---they aren't good. They need to find fries that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside like most restaurants. But for now, I'll just stick with the pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious chicken ranchero is one of the best pizzas i have ever had and they have a deal where u get xl specialty pizza with free sub or wings deff a must try"}
{"text":"If you like toppings on your pizza, don't bother with this joint. They'll skimp you heavily!"}
{"text":"Terrible service ordered hoagie w no dressing loaded w mayo says mayo is not a dressing why they didn't put it on the side is beyond me.  Said they were too busy with A convention in town and couldn't redeliver the hoagie. They also sent us undercooked wings that I had to finish off in my own oven.  So much for loyalty to this pizza shop"}
{"text":"This has become one of the most terrible place under the new management. They do not deliver on time and leave materials out. They charge extra and worst customer service. Be aware."}
{"text":"We ordered their supreme pizza (Parma Pizza). It tasted like a frozen pizza, but with less flavor (which is an impressive feat). The crust was hard and flavorless. We also had the chocolate cake. This was a mistake. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"decent pizza and hoagies, tomato bisque soup is a+, good service. reliable downtown joint with no complaints."}
{"text":"Food took 90 minutes, after being told 45 minutes, was cold and kinda crappy to be truthful, flavorless and bland. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Such great food, even better customer service. This is by far my favorite Pizza place in the south hills."}
{"text":"Terrible. Put in a lunch order and they got two orders wrong (two gluten intolerant coworkers got bread instead of wrap). Manager straight said \"we rushed your order and got it wrong and didn't bother to tell you\" when a coworker asked about it, said he wouldn't help her and hung up the phone when she asked for a refund. Will never go again"}
{"text":"Good for a fast lunch. Had the gyro and added feta. Gyro was fine. Bottle of coke had icy slush in it."}
{"text":"I attempted to contact the business through their web site to give them a chance to respond but kept getting \"invalid character\" error messages.  So I'll post this here instead.  Zero stars is more appropriate, from the order taker to the follow-up phone call responses to the quality of the food.  I called in an order for a pizza on Sunday, February 18, at 7:30 to be delivered to the Cambria Suites hotel in downtown Pittsburgh.  The woman who took the order did not seem to be familiar with the hotel and she asked for the address, which I gave her.  She didn't ask for a room number or a last name but told me the pizza would arrive in approximately 45 minutes.  After about 30 minutes, I went down to the hotel lobby to wait.  By 8:30, the pizza had not arrived so I called the restaurant and was told it was on its way.  Called again at 8:45 and was told the driver was en route and would call when he was outside.  Called again at 8:49 and at 9:04, still no pizza.  Finally, at 9:09 the driver arrived and I went out to meet him.  As he was pulling the pizza from the trunk of his car, I asked how long he had been driving around with my pizza in his car and he, not understanding what I was saying, apologized and said \"very busy\".  \"Very busy\" does not explain why he drove around with the pizza for over an hour, possibly longer, without calling me to find out where I was or getting me a fresh pizza.  The pizza was ice cold and my family ate it only because we had waited nearly 2 hours and other food options were dwindling at that hour.  I don't even know why I paid for it.  By the way, I was also told, when I called back at 9:12 to complain that the pizza was cold and dried out, that none of the drivers speaks English.  That's not a problem unless they can't call and ask for directions.  Then it's a big problem."}
{"text":"Stop by here to check out this 20\" hoagie I have been hearing about around town...its well 20\" loaded...your appetite has to be big to order this puppy...all and all this is a legit authentic shop doing things fresh...i recommend this to all my yelpers!!!!...  Next time I am going to get a pizza the 18\" Steak Rodeo sounded awesome...but I went with the irresistible 20\" grinder  :):);):);):)"}
{"text":"I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour.   The pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin."}
{"text":"I dont know... The quality just isnt there. Ive ordered from here tons when i worked evenings because theyre open late, Ive tried a bunch of menu items and nothing ever really wow'd me. Its just all real generic tasting. Not terrible and they never jacked my order up. For the price, and its not even expensive, id find a different spot if youre looking for a late night del. If its before 10:00 theres plenty better. Dont forget to tip your driver"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with green pepper and onion with a side of onion rings.  The quantity of green pepper and onion was minimal, as well as the cheese and tomato sauce.  The onion rings were over cooked with absolutely no flavor.  This was the worst pizza experience I have ever had in Pittsburgh.  I would not recommend them.  In addition, the food was delivered lukewarm.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you are ever looking for late night pizza, forget about it here. They say they are open until 2am but I have frequently called before 1:40am and they have said the kitchen is closed. Ridiculous that they advertise that they are open until 2 (when the bars close) but will not make anything past 1:30."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Just plain gross. The crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic. I would never order their food again. Gross, gross, gross."}
{"text":"I've lived in Shadyside for about ten months now. This place had become my go-to.  The pizza is still good, no question.  But, I'm still struggling with simple things here.  I order the same salad, EVERYTIME! Mediterranean, add chicken, no cruton. NO CRUTON! I'm guessing out of twenty (at least), I've not had cruton 3 times. The menu says the salad comes with cruton, but their computer screen doesn't show cruton as an option to subtract. They've showed it to me. But the food prep area has cruton on the guide. Again, I've been shown.  I just don't like crunchy then soggy bread chunks on salad. Sorry...  This last time I kinda lost it and called them out on fb. I was immediately called to remedy the issue with free everything. That's not how I roll, though. I don't want free food for their constant mistake. I usually eat half the salad with dinner and take the other half for lunch. Hence the now gross af soggy bread all through my salad.   Also, I ask for an extra side of sauce to dunk my crust in. Every time I order pizza. I have received the extra sauce 4 times in 22. Yes, at this point I'm counting.  To their credit, after multiple text exchanges with the \"manager\". Which in itself was weird that they would think it ok to randomly send me a message just because they have my phone number on file. I have a credit of my purchase cost under my phone number. But am wary to use due to possible retribution."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Good for drunk food at the end of the night. My friend ordered mushrooms on hers, and they didn't tell her that they don't have mushroom pizza until they handed her a slice of pepperoni."}
{"text":"PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls.   The large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.  That is all."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch along with my coworkers for delivery..  crab ravioli with garlic bread.  $10.99 I was not impressed.  Ravioli usually has an ample amount of filling.   They were so flat it looked like a plate of sauce.   And only 3 raviolis and one crushed one!    Dish was overly salty!  Garlic bread was hard!   Definitely not worth the $ and not ordering again!   It's a shame, it had potential to be a great dish... someone dropped the ball!"}
{"text":"3 pizzas for 50 bucks. A little bit expensive, I think. The pizzas were okay. There was too much sauce on all of them and, unlike most pizzarias in Pittsburgh, they skimped on  the cheese. The dough was good, but it wasn't *WOW*. Also...and this may sound petty, but the Extra-Large said 16 slices. Some of the slices were 1 1/2 inches wide. Others were normal sized. And two were like 5 inches wide. It would have made more sense to have like 12 normal sliced, foldable slices.  Still...for  the price...I'll pass next time on this place."}
{"text":"I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion."}
{"text":"Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. As for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself, so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. Overall, if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it."}
{"text":"This place was right near the Megabus and we were hungry, so we stopped in and got a few slices and some sodas for the road. I must say, I was very happy with the road treat.  The pizza slices were warm, cheesy, fresh and perfectly cooked and the road sodas were cold. Slices were massive......and that's how I like it.  I'd choose this place over a Sbarro's 9 times out of 10.....and I like S'barros, so that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.  Pizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude."}
{"text":"I was stranded in Pittsburgh for a few hours, actually stranded, long story. I wanted a place to eat that was moderately priced, and I was craving a sub or hoagie. I opted for the veggie hoagie sans cheese. It was average, I liked that it was served on garlic bread and the Italian dressing was great. Perfectly toasted. I feel like it was a bit pricey for a ten inch veggie hoagie and a soda at 9.75 but it was late and I was hungry. It's a small joint, not the nicest decor, but it's just your average typical pizza place. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pizza around and great service.   I friend turned me on to Pizza Parma few weeks back, and we have ordered from there a few times.  The pizza is always hot and delivered quickly.  I have not had any problems with the pizza being too greasy.  Huge menu and great service too.  They actually messed up my deliver order (just a side dish) the other day, and before I even knew it someone brought the right item back to my house.  Unbelievable service."}
{"text":"I always order from Pizza Parma on Friday nights and receive great service for delivery but this evening I received the wrong order. Giving 3 stars because the pizza is always good but disappointed in the mix up."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago after my friend and I left this bar. The closing time for this spot was 2am. We came in at about 1:30 maybe 1:40. We were immediately ignored and told that they aren't serving pizza anymore because they are closing. (We actually left the bar earlier to get here so we could get something to eat before bed) on yelp the closing time was 2am.   Long story short - we practically had to beg them to make us the smallest pizza that would take maybe 10 minutes, which would still have them done by 2am. They were rude and annoyed and probably spit in our pizza. The pizza sucks, everything about it. The cheese, the sauce, everything. Definitely not homemade or using fresh ingredients. It's really not that difficult to notice or taste those kind of things.  Although I don't want to completely rip into their business, I have some advice. 1. Update your account on your website or yelp if you want to close at a certain time and stick to that 2. Fire you're staff and hire new people to work for you 3. Maybe reconsider the menu and ingredients because you have a lot of other competitors in this part of town"}
{"text":"I have to say, I maybe (/definitely) had these guys programmed into my phone when I lived over in Shadyside. I term this branch \"Good Ole Faithful,\" as they have come to my aid during many times of need, which possibly includes Saturday nights at 2am (sorry for having to deal with me, guys). The pizza is freakin cheap and pretty damn good, especially for the price. I maybe (/definitely) use to call them every Monday when they had an extra-large one-topping pizza AND an order of bread sticks for only 9.99...... 9.99! I'm not sure that they still run this deal, but I could generally get a large cheese for about 10 bucks, and you can't really beat that. Not too greasy, just enough but not too much cheese, their pizza (and actually other food items, which is surprisingly quite extensive) is better than average and tasty for a night in alone or stumbling in with friends after a night out. I usually just walked over, where's it's perfectly nestled in the shopping center across from Mad Mex and Buffalo Blues on S. Highland- however, they deliver too- and both options are surprisingly quick. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great Hoagies!   I always get the Steak Deluxe hoagie and my wife gets the Italian Deluxe and then we give each other half of the other ones hoagie because we can never decide on with one to get."}
{"text":"Always been wanting to try this place. Finally placed an order one night for pickup. I'd have to say it was very very good!! We got a large pizza w mushrooms and pepperoni along with an order of fried mushrooms. Everything was very good. I live nearby and will definitely be ordering from here again be it pickup or delivery. Seemed like they have an extensive menu with many options to choose from. I can't believe I waited this long to try it !!! You won't be disappointed. :))"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 extra large pizzas for my family and friends who helped me move over the weekend.   We were pleasantly surprised that the 3 pies fed all 8 of us (and some of us twice!).   The pizza was sliced thin, which I personally like, and tasted good as well! I also liked that the pepperonis were small.   I almost forgot.. The delivery man was really friendly too!"}
{"text":"Can't deliver within the promised guaranteed time even though I'm 10-15 minutes away from the location. Tried to argue with me when I wanted to cancel the order. My first time trying to order from here and my last!   Update: They still haven't refunded my money even though they didn't deliver, now I'm filing a dispute with my bank. Unprofessional and dishonest, how much worse can you get?"}
{"text":"Pizza Parma delivers through GrubHub, which is the primary reason I ordered sandwiches from them. BBQ chicken was ok. The bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side, leading it to be dry. The value is good. The 20\" sandwich was about $11."}
{"text":"I am really disturbed, tonight I ordered crab ravioli and I have kind of a special cheese culture allergy. Creams totally fine in small doses milk is too) so I ordered to the ravioli and said please no cheese it'll make me very sick.\"  \"If there's no way to order this without just call me and I'll change my order.\"   The pasta came smelling an awful lot like mozzarella) so I called and asked if the guy could check if the order had accidentally had cheese put in it. I mean I get things happen! \"  The gentleman told me he didn't know what was in the food and I should look it up online.\" Then he proceeded to say if I was worried I should have someone taste it and snorted when I said I was dining alone. I'm upset and offended. I run my own business... and promote local business's constantly. I will be very sure to let everyone know this Pizza Parma.. believes the customer is not only not right, but their health doesn't matter.  What a bummer. I used to be a big fan."}
{"text":"Food- 2/5 Service 1/5  The pizza came cold, the fries were soggy, the meatball sub was little pieces of ground beef not \"balls\", and the soda exploded on my student who was opening the bottle up.   There was a confusion with the delivery address so I understand why it was not on time. However by the time that we figured out that the food was being delivered to my home and not my work, I figured it would only take 10 more minutes of wait time since my house is 5 minutes from home. My food did not come another 15 minutes and the person could still not understand how he could get into the school. Needless to say at school we only have 40 minutes for lunch and recess and so this fun school lunch became a pain."}
{"text":"Since I'm in a bad mood, I figured that i would turn to Yelp and write another review about pizza Parma!!! You see kids, My last review was removed, it was a two star (ha, now you lose a whole other star, smarty pants turn me inner) because I spoke about how horrible the pizza was. How utterly disgusted I was with it.   For your sensitivities, I'll be less graphic this time around, okay kiddo?  I spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza. My gut was a mess and calling a spade a spade, the pizza is overpriced for the quality or lack of quality, that is.  The hoagie was no better. Even my six year old thought it was horrid and that kid almost eats anything.   I still recommend eating at other pizza places because I feel it's my yelping duty to save others from a gross, disgusting dining experience.   Plus, it took forever for us to receive said pizza, as if some master mind spent quality time, assuring it's rancidness.  Whatever. Go ahead and turn me into the Yelp police for being honest about your bad, awful, terrible pizza!"}
{"text":"************************************* DELIVERY REVIEW *************************************  We just moved into a new place, still in the city, and as we were moving things in we didn't want to cook. We called up Pizza Parma and ordered a pizza for delivery. Even with the worst cell reception in the tri-state-area, the guy stayed on the phone patiently, and made sure to get my order, my adress and credit card info.   a half hour later our doorbell rang, and a nice guy in his mid-50s was there with our pizza and when we answered the door he said \"I brought you a hoagie too... we made an extra!\" I ended up shooting the breeze with him about the neighborhood for about 5 minutes. He was so friendly!  the Sub was a cheesesteak, and it was AWESOME.   The pizza was pretty solid, and the service was great. The pizza seemed a little expensive, but all things considered, it wasn't as bad as some.   I will likely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I have been super happy with Pizza Parma in Downtown Pittsburgh.  At first, you're like wow it is a hole in the wall, but it's totally worth it.  Located on Penn Avenue it is certainly one of those places that you can't judge on first appearances.  Otherwise, most people might turn around assuming it isn't too late and everything else already closed.  (Looking at you Pittsburgh nightlife.)  So why a 4-star review?  Because the food is good and the pricing is on par or better with the other offerings in the pizza and fast food genre.  Myself and a couple of coworkers take turns buying pizza, breadsticks, and other appetizers once a week.  For the past two months, we've had a series of positive experiences, varying from \"hey this was good,\" to \"holy crap!  That was some good food\".  Online ordering is extremely convenient when you're walking across town to grab the food.  And the staff is always quick in filling the orders and getting the food out."}
{"text":"I order from these guys on campusfood.com They are pretty good .. i get my order on time and their quality has been pretty consistent I mostly get things like hoagies and pizzas.. they are pretty decent This place is pretty convenient for me when I am working on campus late at night when most other places have shut down."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them.   Maybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I feel like Pizza Parma is a prime example of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" When you walk by Pizza Parma while downtown, it's pretty easy to write it off, especially when there's so many fine dining options in the area now. It doesn't help that the place tends to be pretty empty, at least from what I've observed - a lack of visible patrons definitely can keep people away. But today I decided to give them a shot, because I really didn't want to stop in anywhere for a big meal - I just wanted a cheap piece of pizza.  Though the place does have a \"dive-y\" feel to it, it did look very clean and had a welcoming atmosphere once I ventured on in. The tables and chairs - which were mostly the elevated and interconnected kind - admittedly looked a little worn down, but they weren't gross or anything like that. Since I knew I'd likely be eating in a few hours I opted to just eat a plain piece of cheese pizza to hold me over. One piece of cheese pizza and one bottle of Dr. Pepper to go with it cost me $4.25 - not bad, in my opinion. And while not fancy by any means the pizza was pretty tasty; it had the right blend of cheese and pizza and the sauce was very flavorful. It was exactly what you'd want when enjoying a plain ol' piece of pizza.  I'll definitely keep this place's super quick service, relatively cheap prices and impressive portion sizes in mind from now on - it's good to know that there are places you can get into while downtown like this, and from what I'm hearing/reading it's worth exploring the menu and eating something other than pizza here. I admit, however, that I may get some food to go next time if I can, as the old elevated and connected chairs and tables in here sounded like they wanted to break apart at any moment...maybe it's time to update them. After all, \"Dive-y\" doesn't necessarily have to mean \"falling apart,\" right?"}
{"text":"$24 for a large pizza made of rubbery cheese, about 10 lbs of grease, limited toppings, but it was complete with employees yelling \"fuck! Shit!\" In the background.  First and last time customer. Would love a refund but if the owner is anything like the employee at the counter, I wouldn't want to even hassle with speaking with them."}
{"text":"Hello  Well I'm new to yelp but I heard from my friends this is the place to write a review:):P  I stopped by this place with my friend tonight. We ordered a few things, the service was wonderful, prompt, friendly atmosphere.  I tried the steak salad, wonderful steak BTW, loaded with everything imaginable, homemade Ranch dressing wow.wow.wow off the charts!!! I even ordered extra for my pizza to dip in Lol its a Pittsburgh thing!!!!!  I'll definitely be back here very often!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great option for a quick dinner. They have a lot of specials and the food is pretty consistent. The wings are delicious! They're big, meaty, and never overdone."}
{"text":"Very good pizza with great convenient hours (seems like always open haha) but quality pizza with good service. Also very fast!"}
{"text":"We usually get breadsticks, which are soft, fluffy and covered in Parmesan cheese and comes with a ramekin of marinara, and we get a large pepperoni pizza. We LOVE the old recipe of pizza which was thick, crunchy but soft dough and plenty of sauce. This last order we got the pizza crust was super crunchy, almost no sauce and the cheese was different. Plus side is the pepperoni a were much better. They were tiny and curled up to hold little grease puddles. I love those type. The pizza itself though was not good."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food and cozy atmosphere. Open late so best place to stop by and get some delicious snacks. 20\" hoagie is the bomb:)"}
{"text":"If you find yourself craving pizza on a Saturday night, you can't beat $9 for a large cheese pizza. I also enjoy the hoagies as they are lightly toasted for a nice crunch.  I can't speak for the pastas or appetizers, but the Pittsburgh style grilled chicken salad is a dependable choice."}
{"text":"Service has definitely improved.  I have over the last 6 months had a consistently pleasant experience ordering over the phone and with delivery.  Very nice people there now both on the phone and on delivery.  Quality of the food remains superior compared with other pizza delivery chains.  I haven't been back to order in person and I've been reluctant to try the online service again though but that would be nitpicking.  Totally noticed a positive change."}
{"text":"I order a meal because I was alone and didn't feel like cooking the food was ok but they never delivered my 2 liter the driver stated he would return with my 2 liter but never came back. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"We just ordered online...it was easy.  Text message to confirm it was processed with estimated time of delivery.  Pizza was delivered within timeframe given.  Driver was courteous.  Five cheese pizza was hot and amazing!  We will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I like the pizza and the selection of toppings.  They are reliable.  Great option for take out food."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizza's from here today to take to some friends who are volunteering for the election.  Everything was ready in less than 30 mins.  The pizza was good - nothing fancy - not too greasy, sauce was good.  I should have ordered the large instead of the medium. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I came in town from Alabama, and my cousin ordered 36 BBQ wings and a Pizza and it was great! The crust was good, the sauce had a kick to it, and we ate the wings and watched march madness. Everytime I come to Pittsburgh I'm gonna try to eat at Pizza Parma at least once!"}
{"text":"The place is a little while in the wall. Dirty and dingy, especially the bathroom (plain gross). Surprisingly the food was decent. You can order by the slice or by the pie (sm, md, lg). Food is served fairly quick. Good variety of apps (fries were oddly really good). Alot of options on menu. Beverages only by bottle. Daily specials available. Probably a good spot for lunch during the week. Pretty sure owners on site, but weirdly watching. Did I mention the super gross bathroom? Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.  The service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.  My husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever."}
{"text":"I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.  I figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.    I have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'  I'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.  I'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here."}
{"text":"Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  I had the Greek salad and my sister had pizza both good choices here.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I have had their pizza before no complaints there but today my boss and I ordered salads and were more than satisfied!! They are fantastic and huge!! The came in about 20 minutes it was super fast will definitely be ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint.  1) They deliver when they say they will,  2) Diverse menu and toppings,  3) Coupons,  4) Online ordering, and  5) Take credit cards.   I think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though. The texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy."}
{"text":"Agree with Darren.  I popped in to Pizza Parma for a slice of pie.     The slices were large, hot, and passed the stand test for New York style slices.  I will definitely go back for their pizza."}
{"text":"Ahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour. One irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \"we don't have those anymore\" or \"no, we can't cook wings dry.\" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Delivery driver called to say he was here and didn't appear for another 5 minutes so waited outside in the cold   He then came without a pen for a credit card order which required a signature.  Order was incorrect and cold.  Called and was told that many of their drivers are new and do not speak English very well.  They were very nice on the phone and offered a free appetizer on a future order, but none of this helps now.  You have to get it right the first time, every time."}
{"text":"My friend is about to have a baby, and we have been ordering a ton of pizza for pick-up in Shadyside lately.  Since I have ironed through most of the places in Squirrel Hill, it's fun to try the other pizza places.  Maybe my friends and I hit Pizza Parma on an extra good night, but we thought the pizza was better than Pizza Perfecta just down the street.  Even better, Pizza Parma has a parking lot!  We ordered an extra large cheese pizza ($13.99 special) and an order of breadsticks ($4.99), and we were told the pizza would be ready in fifteen minutes.  They totaled $17.10 (lower than we expected from menu prices), and I threw a couple dollars in as a tip because the people working at Pizza Parma were so nice!  The man behind the counter was so friendly and everyone working here seemed to be happy.  Plus, our pizza was ready in ten minutes so score.  This was a pretty standard cheese pizza.  There was lots of cheese, which was great.  It wasn't overly spiced sauce nor was the crust special, but we enjoyed the pizza.  The breadsticks were good, but I wouldn't order them again.  They were the circular pizza crust kind, and I prefer the fluffy kind of breadsticks.  All in all, we will probably keep ordering takeout from here.  Other reviewers seem to have other stories about here, but I suspect they have similiar issues to Pizza Bellino in Squirrel Hill.  Some pizza does not survive the delivery process very well.  This pizza wasn't so good once it sat, but it was yummy fresh out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, when I called to dispute a false charge on my card, they told me that it was a \"service charge\", when I hadn't ordered them for a month. Also, I found a dead cockroach in my pizza. The pizza was low quality for the price anyways. I do not recommend this in any way, and I hope that nobody ever orders from here. PS the mozzarella sticks are horrible."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery. The food showed up in a reasonable amount of time and cost a reasonable price. The delivery driver, however, opened up my pizza box right in front of me to put his fingers on the little white table thing that is supposed to prevent the top lid of the pizza box from smashing my pizza. I saw that the pizza was indeed smashed--because the driver had put the fries, wings, and soda on top of it. Then the driver told me that he brought Sprite rather than Pepsi. The driver did not seem interested in returning to the restaurant to retrieve the correct soda. He just gave excuses about the other employees putting the wrong soda out. Well, why didn't the driver check the receipt before he arrived at my door in order to ensure that he picked up the correct items? My husband was overhearing my conversation with the driver at the front door and later told me that the driver was flirting with me with some things that he said. As for the taste of the food, the pizza, wings, and fries tasted OK. They were not great but were not terrible either.   Weeks later, I placed a second order with this restaurant. The provolone sticks tasted fine, the lobster bisque was thick and lumpy and I didn't finish it, and the plain cheese pizza tasted OK.   Overall, the taste of the food is just OK, and the service could improve. Pizza Parma is NOT my go-to place for pizza."}
{"text":"Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.  The pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).  As the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either."}
{"text":"Great friendly service and my order was done fast, which was amazing since I was a walk-in. Lots of toppings piled high but I wish there was more cheese. They did have small bottles of vanilla Coke, which is a rare find these days."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we won't be ordering food from here again.   Earlier this year we ordered a pizza from them off of GrubHub and after waiting an hour and a half we called to check on the order. The lady who answered the phone said they never received our order (even though GrubHub confirmed our order on their app and through a text) and assured us we would have our pizza within 30 minutes. An hour later and it was still not delivered.   Yesterday we decided to give them a second chance. Once again we ordered on GrubHub and they called about 15 minutes later to ask if they could make a substitution to our Greek calzone. That was appreciated and one of the only positives of this place. The delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes.   The Greek calzone was good, not great, but edible. We also ordered spicy provolone sticks and French fries which were easily the worst we have ever had. The quantity (refer to the picture) was extremely disappointing considering the price and the entire order was very cold. The fries seemed as if they had been sitting there for awhile because they were soggy.   Don't waste your time here. There was much better pizza joints in the area that are worth your time and money."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone."}
{"text":"We stopped in here during one of our recent Downtown adventures, and I didn't find the place to be a dump at all. They should turn down the yellow, though! LOL. The pizza's pretty good as well. I had a big slice of pepperoni pizza and had no problems with it. They have a large menu also."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Fast. Friendly. Good price. Eat here. Great after game stop on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Take out and delivery only. Good pizza and our go-to for delivery. Love the hungry man special- cheese pizza, breadsticks, hoagie, and a two liter for $23. Pizza is good- cheesy and delicious. I like the sausage pizza here as well. The steak and meatball hoagies are our favorites. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Awful!! Waited almost 2 hours for food. We ordered from work. The driver got lost!!! Food was cold.  Overpriced too"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie.   One slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Pizza crust and sauce taste really tasty but the cheese was way too cheesy . Maybe it was a very busy time that I ordered it and that's why it was messy pizza ... my niece says \"I don't like this pizza\""}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with pizza Parma. Not going to lie, after reading all of the reviews I was scared to order. My boyfriend and I split the gyro special and got it delivered. Delivery came in the designated time and the food was warm when we received it. The gyros were tasty, the tzatziki was the best part. I will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Pizza one of America's most famous foods. A good pizza is made up of 4 key components: delightful sauce, gooey cheese, fresh toppings, and a buttery flaky crust. Pizza Parma offers gooey cheese, fresh toppings. The crust is decent but what is really holding this pizza back is the sauce. Improve the sauce and I can guarantee you that the ratings will move more towards 5 stars. As for me, I'll continue to look for a good pizza joint in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"$5 large pizzas at night, who doesn't love that.  And they aren't bad.  But they deliver and are way better than Vocelli's.  I have mostly good experiences when I go.  But once I was there waiting for a take out pizza alone, and some drunk Pitt students were harassing like everyone in the place.  To summarize, good pizza and cheap."}
{"text":"I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.  Never order from them."}
{"text":"Strolling through Pridefest the other day we became very hungry. It was hot and crowded and we wanted to strand away from the main event for a little and get a good slice of pizza for a good price.  The atmopshere is very \"dive-y pizza joint-y.\" Nothing wrong with that because I come from the beliefs that the divey-er the better! (Nobody makes chicken fingers and fries like a greasy bar!) There are some tables for sit-in, but nothing is top of the line. It was comfortable to get away from the crowds and escape the heat for a little with only one other table dining inside as well.   I got the lunch deal which was a personal pan pizza (one topping of your choice) and a bottle of pop for about $7-$8. Not bad! The pizza tasted great, was at a good temperature and had that good amount of grease that I was anticipating from a downtown pizza shop.   Service was great as well! The man working the counter acknowledged us from the moment we walked through the door and was nothing but kind. He answered all of our questions and was very polite."}
{"text":"I love there chicken salads yummmm .. And they have good pizza too so when your chilly in the house order up"}
{"text":"Wow really tasty pizza! We did a 2 topping large pizza deal from a coupon I got on a takeout menu. I asked for less cheese on the pizza and it turned out incredible ! The cheese was really tasty and rich so it was good to ask for less cheese (especially if you're a pizza sauce fan like I am). The crust was also really good. Not too thick. I'm a N.Y. pizza fan so I don't like that type of crust you're going to get from sorrentos or whatever that is thick undercooked and falling apart.  Great take out pizza. It's a little pricey for the pizza - that's why I took off a star. It was ~$20 with tax for a large pizza."}
{"text":"I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in, so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and ordered delivery to my hotel! Pizza arrived quick, hot and tasty!!!! I'm glad I chose Pizza Parma!! The crust was nice and buttery!!"}
{"text":"Updating because we decided to give the food another try. We ordered an extra large cheese pizza carry out special and an antipasto salad. The pizza was much better than it used to be.  The crust was crispy but chewy and well done, just how we like it.   The salad was enormous, enough for 3 meals, and everything on it was fresh and delicious.    I'll begin ordering again!"}
{"text":"After a full, exhausting day of moving into my new place, my mom, her husband, and I ordered Pizza Parma for delivery. We ordered calzones, a salad, and BBQ wings. The delivery took about 15-20 minutes. We each ordered a small calzone (the Mediterranean, the five cheese, and the Italian). The calzones were a lot bigger than we expected. It was enough for us to eat dinner and have some left over for breakfast and a snack for lunch. They were all really good and filling. Well worth the $10 each. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"It was my birthday, I was drunk, and high off of stripper fumes from Blush located next door. Pizza sounded amazing.  The employees here had an awesome sense of humor and a great attitude. Pizza is floppy, greasy, salty, and delicious. I inhaled two slices along with a Mexican coke. +1 star for Mexican coke yeah! +1 star for the sign about the shakers that I thought was HILARIOUS at whatever hour I was there.  Thanks Pizza Parma! You are a champ!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here a few times and the food isnt bad. Occassionally they forget to do the special request I ask for my food but over all good service."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour. This was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place."}
{"text":"Blazes! What's with all the resentment and venom being thrown and spat at poor old Pizza Parma? Another local chain, Pizza Parma's presence can be sightings throughout the city, and this one is open until 1AM during the week and until 2AM on weekends!   After stopping into Pizza Parma after a very late weeknight concert days before to stave off dehydration with a soft drink (I ain't payin' $4 for a Coke at Altar Bar, and nothin' else was open Downtown!) AND catching an eyeful of their pizzas, I vowed to return.  The following week, Kay wanted to support a friend who was selling her wares at Boutique 208, and on the way home via trolley, we decided to snag a light dinner of pizza cuts and...lobster bisque???  PP has a fairly expansive and unusual menu that is not at all confined to pizza, hoagies, calzones, and wings. Nuh-uh. If you dare glance at their pamphlet (or their website), you'll find crabcakes, tilapia, ocean perch, whiting, catfish, shrimp, gyros, baked ziti, linguini, ravioli, manicotti, fetuccine alfredo (!), teriyaki chicken salads, turkey, and even fried okra!   The lobster bisque was a special not on their canonical bill of fare, so I figured what the hay?  And it was creamy, thickened, and not at all awful, but for the price, I s'pose I shouldn't have expected to see or eat any chunks of actual lobster. However, the lobster essence was there. I'm left wondering if the soup came out of a can or bag, though. It recalled a scene from one of my preferred childhood films...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdZPSGRPtG4  The pizza, on the other hand, was of the same quality found at Bethel Park's capable Fellini's. Kay and I each had a whopper of a NY-sized wedge with teacup pepperoni shavings dotting the oozing mozzarella landscape. The edges were bubbling and slightly burnt, the crust was sturdy, and the sauce tasted of tomatoes so sweet, they must have been left to ripen at the point just before spoilage. \"NASTY?\" Anything but. People need to stop reviewing when they're in a bad mood. It has the potential to hurt businesses, that is if they are to be taken seriously, and I don't think they should. May the algorithm claim thee...  P.S. Are all Pizza Parmas so yellow on the inside? Damn was this joint lutescent! Green Lantern would be shit outta luck up in here! It didn't bother me, mind you. I just thought it was odd. Hey, at least ya can't miss 'em.   P.P.S. Each slice of pizza with pepperoni was $2.80. The cup of lobster bisque was $5. Having mentioned that, I didn't find PP to be expensive.  P.P.P.S. We had no problems with the service nor did we wait long for our food. The gent behind the counter even brought everything to our table when it was ready. Do I live in a parallel universe? Sometimes I think so."}
{"text":"They advertise that they are open until 2:00 am, but at 1:00 on a busy Friday night they are closed."}
{"text":"Traveling around and it was getting late and the ole stomach was growling.  Remembered that PP was around the corner and we had a coupon.     Stopped in and it felt like we were in the middle of the kitchen..funny little set up but OK with me.    Had a pizza that was good, the dough is semi-thick and tasted OK with the sauce and toppings but the outer crust was kind of blah!   Had some buffalo wings that were good."}
{"text":"Always quick and delicious, lots of cheesy goodness, friendly service that never falters."}
{"text":"Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time."}
{"text":"The only item I've had here is the buffalo chicken salad and it's one of my go tos for lunch if I'm in the area. Very large portion with lots of veggies - the fries are usually soft/borderline soggy though, I'd love if they were crispier and fresh out of the deep frier! Prices are decent - though when it comes to a salad at lunch, $10.99 seems steep. Parking is difficult in this area - there is a small lot in front but spots are tough to come by. Street parking in the area also. Usually can find something since it's just for pick up."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Their pizza is horrible to begin with but it's close to where I live. The Eastern European girl at the register is awful. She tells people they have no more pizza a half hour before they're actually closed. She should probably get fired."}
{"text":"This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure..."}
{"text":"This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Late night in Downtown and nowhere to go for food? Sounds familiar? Unfortunately I can't be much of a help unless you consider the usual fast food joints and pizza a good late night snack. The Pizza Parma location on 8th and Penn does its job okay, pizza in all sizes (slice starting at $2.50), soft drinks, salad and pasta dishes, for eat-in or take-out.  Sure, I've eaten better pizza in my life but if it's 10pm and all choices out there are McDonald's, Subway, or Pizza - I'll choose the greasy Italian-like option."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I ordered food and when it had my arrived after 75 minutes, I called. A woman answered and said the driver had been there 15 mins ago and was returning the food to the restaurant because they couldn't get a hold of me. I ordered on delivery.com, my phone number was correct. She'd given the driver the wrong number. It was correct in the order, but she wrote it down incorrectly. She didn't apologize, she didn't acknowledge her mistake, all she said was, \"The driver will be there shortly.\" And she hung up. When I finally got the food after 95 minutes, the items were soggy and dry, respectively. They didn't offer to remake it. I'm livid. I'd ordered Pizza Parma a few times from the office, and have never gotten it exactly right. This was the last straw. Soggy nachos? Cold, dry chicken fingers? Ain't nobody got time for that! Never again."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.    If this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow."}
{"text":"I really like this pizza! I walked in and there was a special for a $10 large pizza.  I got plain cheese and it was ready in 10 minutes.  Very yummy and I look forward to going here again."}
{"text":"I ordered four large pizzas for our volleyball team. The pizzas were very good, they arrived at the time I was quoted, and the delivery man was pleasant.  I would order again from this pizza place."}
{"text":"We ordered from Ubereats since our regular pizza place had closed for the night. We got fried mushrooms and spicy cheese sticks, as well as the barbecue chicken pizza. The food was ready super fast. We got our order in 25 minutes. Everything was hot and fresh. I love the fact that the appetizers come with a little side of fries, so each person can have their own appetizer! It's like a mini meal before the pizza. The pizza was phenomenal. All the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were put together so nicely. We're probably gonna he ordering from here now than our usual pizza place because we enjoyed it so much!"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars, I would. Was forgotten after being on hold for 15 minutes, called back and was greeted by a very rude employee. Her attitude was enough to never order from Pizza Parma again. The delivery driver went to three different houses before ours (people make mistakes not a big deal). The Italian hoagies are usually good from other locations... But this was absolutely terrible... It was 95% bread and the other 5% of meat and vegetables weren't fresh and very bland. There are many other great pizza joints around town. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous.  My sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty. The shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running."}
