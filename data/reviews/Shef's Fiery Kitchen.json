{"text":"Shef's is a great spot for lunch! The counter staff are pleasant and knowledgeable. Their Indian food is very good and I recommend the \"Naanwich\" with Chicken Tikka.  The addition of yogurt and other herbs and spiices makes this a knockout! . Also, try it with the lamb - tasty for sure! 
Be aware that this is not exactly fast food. Some menu items like the Naanwich take time, but so worth the wait! The naan is made fresh and is awesome. Try the garlic naan for added flavour. 
They also have a nice selection of fresh frozen curries and other classics like butter chicken and korma. Get on the loyalty program for a free take away dish."}
{"text":"Give this place a go, you can't get much better on the run in a farmer's market. The naan-wich is the way to go. They are also selling their products in Co-op now - try their Thai curries and butter chicken."}
{"text":"Customer service could be better.  The food is ok.  Chicken is usually tough.  It's not terrible, but not great."}
{"text":"Great stall at the farmers market.

People are really nice and food is great. The Nanwich is excellent. They prepare it fresh for you so takes a few minutes but that's how food should be and it's worth it."}
{"text":"Naan-wich. That's why you should go.

I could end the review with that very first line because thats all I needed to hear to convince me to check this food vendor @ the Farmer's Market.

I ordered their chicken Naan-which and graciously waited for 10-15 minutes for them to make it. The wait was worth it. While I thought it would be an Indian version of a shawarma, I was wrong. It was very different. Their naan alone was amazing, it was soft,fluffy, and buttery. The grilled chicken was season with spices that made the taste very unique and it had a yogurt based sauce that just jacked the naan-which's succulence of excellence...yeah thats right you heard me. Succulence of excellence

The price was fair, I always love a hearty lunch that goes under $10. And the ladies-including Ms. Shefali herself, were very friendly and quite lovely to talk to :)

{"text":"I always walk through the food court at the farmers market looking for something to eat and every single time I go back to this wonderful place and get the butter chicken. It is delicious and the people who work there are so friendly.  The food isn't restaurant quality, but it is very good."}
{"text":"All other butter chicken pales in comparison. The best I've ever had. The only reason the crazy parking lot at the market is worth it!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite take-away Indian, whenever I'm at the Market, I stop by to grab a frozen curry, a great variety. Indian,some Thai, lots of options and also great for lunch. Not only can you eat there but take away also."}
{"text":"I want to love this place,  I really do. As someone whose spent the better part of a decade perfecting my curry dishes it's upsetting to see a place with so much potential fall so short of the mark. 

For starters I expect that a proper Indian restaurant offer exceptional rice as a base to many of their dishes. The basmatti rice here was over done and mushy. But a great start. 

An Indian chef once told me that you can judge all curry restaurants by the quality of their vindaloo. This was no exception. The dish is a thin goan style curry that barely hits the mark.

We tried the butter chicken for lunch as the vindaloo just wasnt up to the test. Honestly it wasn't the worst curry,  but they could have done a lot better. 

Consider this place a home style interpretation of what real curry should be. If you want an authentic meal,  try another spot."}
