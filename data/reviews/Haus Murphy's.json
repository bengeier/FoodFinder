{"text":"Here's the deal...

4 in our party. Two of us had Schnitzels, one had the Zaurbraten (sp?) and another had the goulash. The schnitzel was no different than you would get in a fair, the zaurbraten was ok and the goulash beef was tasty but dry. The potatoes were dry and bland.
Spetzle was bland and just ok. 

We had desert and the chocolate fudge cake, was dry and obvious store bought. 

The place is mediocre at best. There was absolutely nothing that made me feel the food was unique or so good that I want to go back. Just \"meh\"

My suggestion to them: Minimize or close the patio and bring everyone inside. (I know, I know...you'll lose a ton of revenue) The place is trying to cater to so many and the food is suffering in quality. There was no doubt that the cooks are just pumping out food rather than putting love into it. (I wanted to have Spetzle rather than potatoes...\"sorry, not tonight because of the volume but I can give you spetzle on the side\"). See what I mean..just pump the food out rather than cater to the consumer. 

I won't make the effort to go back. Boring, meh, and just OK."}
{"text":"Disappointed, 1st and last time coming here. Got violently sick after enjoying the stuff mushrooms. Never again will I eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Bland food. No personality  ordered the German Brat. Brat had no flavor. German potatoes the same. Sauerkraut was soggy and no zip. The split pea soap that came with my meal was the only tasty thing besides the German beer. I could have done a much better job. Sorry excuse for German food."}
{"text":"Real deal good German food. They have made some concessions to Americanize to accommodate but if you order well you will get Authentic German food. I had the wurst  appetizer and it was perfect. Curry ketchup  and two snefs on a bed a sauerkraut was exactly as expected. Rouladen rezept with Spätzle was enjoyed by my dining partners and while the meat may have been a tad dryer that expected the flavors were perfect!! The evening was closed with an authentic not Americanized slice of Black Forest Cake and a birthday treat with a candle :) Worth driving 264 Km"}
{"text":"I love going to Guy Fieri's local hand picked spots....Hands down my favorite place for beer and pretzels. Love, love, love, the horseradish for dipping and you cant get upset with a place that serves 32oz beers. The glasses are bigger than my head. I can never finish it. My love and I made an appearance here on date night last week, so our dining was casual with drinks. Bradford was our server. He was fantastic. They close at 9 during the week but, were good sports and stayed open until we were finished with our drinks. Bradford invited us back on the weekend for live bands (which Joe and I LOVE.) Love going here great service, great people, great food."}
{"text":"All the Snitzel's are excellent and best Apple Strudel in town!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews . My experience was one of disappointment. I highly looked forward to eating here and expected an extraordinary meal. Mediocre service and less than memorable food sullied  the experience. The paprika schnitzel was dull, tasteless and a major dissatisfaction. The sides were equally dismal. I may try this place again only to try the sausages which I saw served to a nearby table and immediately wished I had ordered instead after sampling my meal."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The stuffed mushrooms and paprika soup were amazing amd i felt spoiled by how good it was before my main dish came out.  I cant rememer the name of what i got but it came with a side that had no flavor to it which made me mad.  The beef i got was delicious and had a sweet sauce on it.  My girlfriend got the spicy sausage which she liked.  The best part about this place is that it has a great selection of german beer.  I had the Spaten Oktoberfest and it did its job"}
{"text":"This is not what I was expecting.  I read the reviews but decided to give it a shot.  I should have skipped this place.The wirsing was awful and not cooked.  It was crunchy and tasted interesting.  I did speak with the waiter and he stated maybe they should have cooked it in the oven for another hour.  Wonderful.  Oh, I have never seen German Potatoes like these either.  Sliced thinly and very greasy with no flavor.  Ended up with an upset stomach.   

The main part of the meal was chicken Schnitzel.  It was crunchy with no flavor.  The mushrooms were also not cooked... not a good thing to figure out while eating.  The wine cream sauce was not a wine cream sauce.  Maybe they used the wirsing sauce?  Scrapped off the chicken.

ONLY good part of the meal was the German pretzel.  WE DID NOT get the cheese sauce as it cost extra and we did not get any horseradish mustard as mentioned in a different review.  I am wondering if this restaurant changed management.  I will not recommend or go back. 

I am very disappointed to have paid as much as I did to receive such awful food."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a authentic German restaurant to visit because we really loved out time in Bavaria, but this didn't really catch much of that other than decor.....
I would have to agree with another posting here on Yelp, that the schnitzel is premade and microwaved for their average diner. It wasn't crisp and crunchy right off the stove or fryer, I was actually disappointed in that, since the breading had become soft and soggy. and the roasted potatoes were well done on one side and were burned. 
We had a reservation, arrived, were attempted to be seated and the table still had patrons at it.  The restaurant didn't have adequate entrance space and there was no waiting area save the Biergarten, which is outside.  Its the end of July, in Phoenix. It was literally 115 degrees and we were asked to wait outside.... Once inside, it felt like there are too many tables were crammed in for the space and it was hot inside from just too many people, and the waiter seemed distracted, rushed and was not actually seen very often. We were thirsty a few times.
After reading all the great reviews, I was truly disappointed.  I know there is no place perfect, and I am not a particularly picky person but this isn't quality German food.
We won't be returning"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I always order the same thing.  Potato pancakes are my very favorite and theirs are delicious.  I got an order and it had 4 large potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce.  I ate every bite and wanted to scrape the plate for more.  We sat on the patio and the weather was perfect.  It was crowded for a week night but we got great service, as there were 9 of us for dinner.  The lights from Glendale Glitters was an added bonus.  Glendale always has a beautiful display of lights.  This is our Christmas dinner restaurant each year and I hope the tradition continues."}
{"text":"Can't say I really enjoyed the food. Pretty bland and boring. Took my wife there for her birthday because she loves German food; and we both were disappointed. The pretzel was really good and the service was great, but the atmosphere and food was below par."}
{"text":"Awesome German food, little pricey but the best German food I've found in Phoenix. If you need German food you need to go here."}
{"text":"This is our first time dining at this restaurant. In a nutshell we arrived at 4 and the place was half full  so I was  expecting a delicious meal. We ordered the Brie appetizer, but the batter was still raw and the cheese cold and not melted. A big let down. Then we tried the sauerkraut and pork sausage soup and things started looking up. It was superb, definitely home made with love. I then had the goulash with pickled red cabbage and spaetzle (sorry about spelling). It just tasted like a meat curry nothing like German cuisine and I did not eat it. Bob had the pork shank, which he said he would not go back for. All in all a disappointing dinner date.

This restaurant was recommended by some friends who rave about it.

The carpet was ripped and every horizontal surface is  covered in a thick layer of dust. The 10 inch wide end of an air vent is covered in thick hanging ropes of dust just the same as the fan blades. These pipes are directly above the tables dropping dust bunnies into people's dinner. You can imagine the remaining issues."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with German food so this was my first time trying it and I wasn't a huge fan. I ordered the Kilometer sausage which came with a soup, 2 really long sausages, potatoes, and sauerkraut. Although it didn't look familiar, the flavor reminded me of sausage I could buy in a pack of 6 at the grocery store. The potatoes were also lacking flavor and I realized I don't think I like sauerkraut; ultimately the soup was my favorite part which was pumpkin for that day. It was interesting to see pumpkin as savory rather than sweet and I enjoyed it. The staff was really nice and while I don't think this is a bad restaurant, I just don't think it is fit for my taste."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous! The atmosphere was delightful and our server was a true German. There were four of us eating, we split the Brie and croute, fantastic! we each had different Schnitzel, however the Wiener schnitzel was the best!! Sooo amazing!! Wow! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's remind me of munich,German!
I go to this place every friday!
My recommend menu is Jager schenitzel, sausage sampler:-)"}
{"text":"Perhaps my hubby is better off writing this review, since he LOVES German food. This is one of his favorite restaurants to eat at.He loves their schnitzel! As for me, I love the huge hot pretzels with Guilden mustard. The beer is off the wall! I always make sure to save room for their decadent whiskey bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at Haus Murphy's and it is part of the rotation when we have out of town guests.  If you like German food I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Our waiter was incredible!  We came there today for lunch and we arrived at 11:30 and it didn't open until 12:00.  The gentleman inside noticed us peering in the windows and invited us in for a beverage!  Wow!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Well we were really disappointed with our dinner yesterday.  The soup came out almost cold and after being sent back by all it came out just a little warmer.  The Schnitzel was very good, but no bread was served and the sauerkraut was in an awful gravy.   You must order red cabbage as a side dish and the Spatel was just put through a ricer not a dumpling maker.  Been there many times and enjoyed the food but will not be back anymore."}
{"text":"Complete disclosure here... I've not yet found my niche in the German cuisine.  I've sampled from several sections of the menu and haven't yet found a dish I didn't like, but haven't found that gem that wows me.

No, what I love about this place is the atmosphere.  Sitting on the patio on a warm (or cool) day enjoying the cuisine and the company of friends.  And great steins of beer.  There are several from which to choose ranging across the German spectrum.

Still, the highlight is their Oktoberfest celebration.  They truly set up (what I'd imagine is) a great bier garden experience (even though I've never actually been to one).  It's already pencilled-in for next year."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our visits to this restaurant. It's so nice to sit out on the little patio courtyard at night under the lights and take in the view.   Service can be hit or miss, depending on how busy they are.

Food is pretty good.They have the most amazing sauerkraut, it's almost a little sweet, and not like any sauerkraut I've had before. The German fried potatoes are delicious, crispy and well flavored.  We had bratwurst and schnitzel last night.  I thought the bratwurst was a little bland, and will try a different type of sausage next time."}
{"text":"We get over to downtown Glendale a couple times a year and the crowds are always big at Haus Murphy's. A few times we tried getting in but the wait was too long. 

Last weekend we went to see the Glendale Glitters and the lines weren't bad, we were really excited to finally give it a try!

We had all eaten German food before and were anxious to have a great German meal. 

Little did we know what an utter disappointment was about to be served to us by a lacking server. 

The German potato's were very bland, absolute flavorless sausages, the most blah meatloaf we've ever tried. The chicken schnitzel was by far the best item, however, it was just alright and not great. 

I can't believe that we had waited so long only to be so completely let down. 

The Italian restaurant a block away is fantastic, we'll return there the next time we're in Glendale for a meal."}
{"text":"I had not had, or even thought about, red cabbage for many years. It was something we ate frequently at my grandma's house. So, I was very excited to see it on Haus Murphy's menu. And, it was as good as I remembered it.   We enjoyed all of the food, starting with the giant Bavarian pretzel.  The Wiener Schnitzel, Kraut Roulade, wirsing and sauerkraut were very flavorful and authentic.  The staff was very friendly and the service was good. All in all, we had a great experience and will definitely be back. We are looking forward to cooler weather so we can enjoy the outdoor beer garden!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  My dad was born and raised in Germany and he just loved to eat here before he passed away.  We even had his 70th birthday party here on their awesome patio and it was such a success.  All of our guests loved it!  The food is fabulous and the service is great."}
{"text":"food was decent, but overpriced for what it was and where it was. waitress was rude. service was incredibly slow. we had waited about 30 minutes to order, and another hour or so to get our food. on top of that, the waitress told us without apologizing that they ran out of soup that was supposed to be included with our meal. when i asked how much longer the food would take, the waitress replied \"why? do you have to be somewhere?\" we didn't even bother with dessert. live music was entertaining though (an extra star for that), but that was the only good thing about eating there. i will never come here again."}
{"text":"We celebrated my husbands birthday tonight. Karley took such good care of us!  She suggested the combo dinner for two which was the perfect amount for the three of us and it was delicious. Of course we had to start with the BIG pretzel! We had a great experience!  Karley made it so much fun, great personality, didn't miss a beat!   Thank you Karley!"}
{"text":"Im sure this place is better... however per circumstance I have to rate it poorly.  We showed up about 8:15 dodging construction and Glendale night walking folk to a fairly empty restaurant. Waited to be seated for 5 minutes and grabbed a couple menus to pass the time... Anyways, first thing the bearded, long haired, and very german waiter has to say to me is that the kitchen is closed. The hours stated they were open till 9. Either way, the onion soup could have been good if it was hot, as well as my knockwurst. My fiance got the chicken schnitzel and it was pretty good. I have worked in the industry and would have rather had them tell me to come back another time than recieve half ass food and service."}
{"text":"Loved it. Went with the husband and friends, which meant I got to try a bit of everything. Everything was outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Drove 90 miles round trip just to eat here.  Very quick friendly service.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"What it lacks in ambience it fails to make up for in service or food. Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives correctly identified this as a dive; however, any redeeming or endearing qualities he saw substantially escape me."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!  I had family in from out of town and said they just had to try Haus Murphy's. They loved it!!  Even my sister who is on the picky side. I would recommend coming here to anyone who wants authentic German fare or just really good food. Our waiter was fantastic, very attentive to our needs. The beer selection is wonderful. My favorite though is this creamy cheese and cabbage dish they make. Out of this world!!  Keep up the good work, you have a customer for life."}
{"text":"I can't say I eat German everyday or would even think to find a German place.  I have to say, I was glad my son and I stopped in and ate.  Great service and good food!  I will stop in again next time I go down to the downtown Glendale area."}
{"text":"They have an awesome deal going on this month: 4 course meal for 2 people only 35$. We are definitely coming back for the cabbage soup during the colder months. I wish they would bottle their hot mustard for resale!!!!! Yum yum."}
{"text":"When making my list of best places I have every eaten, Haus Murphy's makes the short list for consideration.  This is German food made the way both my grandmothers made.  This is the German food I found in home kitchens in Hamburg.  The schnitzels are true schnitzels and delicious.  The sausages are correctly named and not American knock-offs. The hackbraten would do my grandmother proud (though I thought she called it hackerbraten). But the sauerbraten is beyond belief!  That alone would make a trip to Phoenix worth the price.  
The ambiance is home-style, not elegant - but it doesn't have to nor should it be. The service has always been adequate and friendly.  The ambiance is a 4 and the service a 3+ but the quality of the food is so wonderful the overall rating is a 5 (but should be higher).  I truly cannot see how anyone who has truly eaten here could rate Haus Murphy's less than a 5.  (Well unless they don't care that much for true German food and then I could see the lowest rating a 4+)"}
{"text":"Tonight my family and friends of 12 dined at haus. The server was great as well as the food. Classic Menu and they offer a military discount even had the owner come sit at our table with us and talk. People bash in this place sometimes but don't listen to a one time review. I've been at least ten times over the past two years and have always had a great time."}
{"text":"Lukewarm food. Otherwise ok. Nice menu and didn't take too long to get the food. We got a little soup before the meal and that was only like warm also."}
{"text":"In our continuing quest to try one new restaurant a month, we headed to Haus Murphy for beers Friday night. Haus Murphy has a wonderful array of German beers on tap and has the added advantage of being walkable for us as we are located slightly north of downtown near Manistee Ranch.  We were delighted with the homey bar area and the beer selection.  I had the Heffeweisen, which was light and fruity with a mild clove aftertaste.  My drinking buddies had the light lager and the brown dunkel in the big-gulp size (I kid you not! The small is 16 ounces and the large is a whopping 32 ounces). Did I mention it was a good thing we walked.   All in all a lovely, laid-back experience.  This is what a neighborhood bar should be. Please y'all, stay away from the souless chains at Arrowhead and patronize our local and deserving Glendale establishments. You will not be disappointed.  Oh, one other note --the beer is appropriately chilled for American palates and not room temp like in Germany --something we were relieved to discover after our stroll through the neighborhood (still 100 degrees at 9 pm.)"}
{"text":"This review is for the vegetarians (like myself)... not the spot to go :P I think every restaurant should have at least one good vegetarian dish. The pretzel was yummy though, just not \"dinner\"."}
{"text":"Beer lover's rejoice. Weihenstephan on tap. Dank sausage. All homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"First visit. Authentic German food and an old world feel. Typically German with a loud area and a more quiet area. Biergarten outdoors looked casual and friendly. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We attended the krombacher beer dinner last night at Haus Murphy and it was a great time. The menu was outstanding and the beers they paired with each coarse was perfection. For all you got the price was very reasonable. This was a first event and hope they make it annual and would strongly recommend it. The staff was as friendly and accommodating as usual. It was my birthday and was sung happy birthday in German. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went with my German class on a fried trip food was amazing every time I'm in old town Glendale I try to stop in"}
{"text":"This is our favorite German restaurant since our trip to Austria! Carlene, our waitress, was the best!"}
{"text":"The eisbein dish is one of the best to get, and pairs well with German larger! If you can, try to catch Haus in a less busy time of year (don't go in October). You will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"About as close to European (German) food you can get with out going to Germany.very good service.very much worth checking out.but far from low fat :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Personable service.  

The Oktoberfest pretzel is huge and delicious.  Be sure to order the cheese with it.   I also had the sauerbraten, served with spatzle and red cabbage.  Delicious!

The glühwein -- hot, mulled red wine -- was also terrific.  Just what I needed on a chilly November day."}
{"text":"Im sad to read the bad reviews... I dig this place.  As with many places Im sure that they have the occasional misfire, but all in all they really do serve a mean schnitzel.  

I don't know why anyone would go there and order anything but sausage or schnitzel.... It's a German place, don't order a cheese plate or a pasta.

The Hubby and I hit them up about every other week now that we live within walking distance. The beer is great - fantastic German options that are wicked hard to find on draft anywhere else in town.  The atmosphere is just okay, but the service has always been good... the sausage is YUMMY and the sauerbraten is to DIE for. All of their sides are tasty too - I've never lived in Germany, but the spatzle, wirsing, red cabbage and dumplings are UBER!

Don't expect it to change your life, but go get your beer on- star with a sausage sampler and try something off the specials or schnitzel list."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Haus Murphy's and the family was really looking forward to some German food and German fun. The food was decent, their sauerkraut was delicious and flavorful! My husband had their cabbage roll and enjoyed each bite! We sat on the patio and the outside ambiance was charming.  Their live music was fun, i enjoyed how they roamed around the restaurant, giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here with another couple on a fairly busy Friday night.  

Pros:
The recipes are close to authentic German in some cases.  
Beer list is pretty good. 
German music on Fridays, though if you want to converse with each other its way too loud.  


Cons:
Outdated, dusty decor.  Someone needs to inspect and clean the out of the way spots.  Outside brick patio has black grime that hasnt been washed in decades.
Food is basic, nothing exceptional. 
Service was terrible.  Young waiter copped an attitude. Service was S-L-O-W.     We ordered a bread basket with our dinner, it came around dessert time. 
Kind of cheesy overall, but this is Glendale. The bar for great food and cleanliness is pretty low.  And sadly i say that as a Glendalian.  

Would be good for the owners to walk the floor and see the dirt in the crevices and listen in on the service."}
{"text":"It used to be a good restaurant, but no more. The service was poor, and it took over an hour and a half to get our dinner. They did not have many items on the menu. Terrible and we will never be back."}
{"text":"Skip dessert. The sauerkraut cake is, I think, a cake you'd find in the freezer section of the grocery store. Huge disappointment and totally ruined the experience. The other food is pretty good. Portions are on the generous side. But mostly,  I remember dessert was sad."}
{"text":"Heck. I remember when this place was Jacka's Back Alley Grille. Don't remember much about the food but the outdoor setting was always nice. Well now as Haus Murphy's this place just can't be beat. With German beer and food and the setting it seems as if you might have actually stepped into some small German town - especially when you hear the band and the tuba going oompahpah. Onto the food... the mushroom appetizer is just crazy delicious. I also always get some kind of shnitzel. And I always have a few German beers when I'm here although I will occasionally stray and get schnapps or some liqueur. I've ALWAYS had a good time here. Of course, I always have several large glasses of beer as well so I could be biased. In my book it's \"wunderbar\""}
{"text":"Very charming atmosphere.  The smell when you walk in the door is mouth watering.  Mom and pop place you can just completely relax in.  Really good service QUIET and the food taste exceptional."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch.  He ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel.  It came out with cold gravy, which also smothered his fries making them cold and soggy.  I had the Pear and Black Forest Ham sandwich.  It was really good, but my fries were ice cold and mostly hard on the ends.  Really, why not cook up fresh fries?  The bar maid was really nice, helpful and friendly.  I tried the darkest beer, at $7.00 for a small, and thought it was too effervescent.   I could not stop burping from the beer.  Not pleasant for lunch.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We had the sampler and it was great. A couple german beers recommended by our knowledgeable waiter and a great dinner. Next time im going to try some other offerings as I have more idea what I like."}
{"text":"Having lived in Germany for 7 years of my adult life (as a member of the USAF), I've had my fair share of German food. The Food at Haus Murphy's was just ok; I would call it the American version of German Food.  I think the menu is overpriced for what you get.  I would probably eat here again if the prices were more reasonable but until that happens I will have to find somewhere else to get my German fix."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's has the best authentic german food in the valley! There is anything on the menu I wouldn't try.

My husband and I shared the Bauernplatte which is a combo plate for 2.  It is a variety of dinners on a huge platter.  DELICIOUS!!!

They have a great assortment of German beers for a very good price ($11 for a Liter... LITER!!!)

Prices are very reasonable.

We will defiantely be going back!"}
{"text":"Can you say Schnitzel?  Every time I visit Arizona, I have to stop at this restaurant... very authentic,  I had the Wiener Schnitzel, for appetizer the potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce and some strudel for dessert... Oh, and I had to have a german beer too so that my belly was extra full before I left..  I am german and think this place is very true to it recipes... Not a place to go for dieting...  I wish I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun with great atmosphere! The service was good and restaurant appeared clean. Love the beer garden with the fun band! My husband is German and was craving some of the food he grew up with and he wasn't disappointed. We split this big German meal for two that had a lot of different food including: sauerkraut, sausage (2 kinds), potatoes, meatloaf and their horseradish mustard. My husband got a huge beer the the of his head! The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I wasn't really into the food that we had I felt that it needed more seasoning or salt. My husband thought the entire meal was amazing though and completely cleaned his plate (he is more into German cuisine). My son really wasn't that into it (15 months old) so next time we'll get him the kids meal. We will definitely be going back as there are a lot of other things on the menu that I would like to try."}
{"text":"My Sister and Brother-in-law took me to my favorite restaurant Haus Murphy for my birthday and believe me when I say, this place is so much fun! The food is absolutely the best German food in the U.S., seriously, I would have to go to Berlin to get better and I even doubt that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Great German beer selection and the food.... . I tried the paprika schnitzel and there was so much amazing food that I was glad to have leftovers. Really fun atmosphere with musicians playing music in the background. Overall it was a very fun experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always up for new experiences, but this one had to be one of the worst experiences of my life. First the service was slow. Then the service became nonexistent. They were not busy the time I went and my server was uncaring and absent most of the time. Our server brings our drinks and wanders off to other tables, not even asking if we were ready to order at that point, which we of course were. Just plops down the drinks and leaves without a word. Once it came to ordering, our server kept writing down different food than we ordered. I can see if the restaurant was overcrowded and busy, but it wasn't. I had a reservation at the time that the restaurant had open for business on a weekday. 
 
So we get our food. I ordered the Wiener schnitzel and it was terrible and cold. How can fried food become cold unless it had been sitting for over a half an hour? Our server later shows up when we're more than half done with our meal and asks if we want refills. I say yes, so she takes both of our drinks and walks off. She never returned with them. About 10 minutes later, after we're both finished eating, she comes by asks how everything is going, unaware to the fact that there are no drinks on the table at all. We asked for our drinks and she quickly ran to the back to fill up our drinks. She brings them back and does not say anything to us; she walked to another table to go help them.

After what happened I will not be going back to this restaurant. I really wanted to like this place. I have read so many good reviews and watched an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network that featured this restaurant and it looked and sounded so amazing. The atmosphere was okay, the tables are really close together. The tables were small and clustered as well. I must have walked in on the wrong day because the experience was terrible."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, and took family from Illinois there this week.   The food is always Excellent and Consistent.  We have tried most of the schnitzels and love them all.  Get ready for a fun time!"}
{"text":"Four of us had 4:30 reservations on Sunday. Place was nearly empty. We were seated and waited for some time for a waiter to finally take our orders.  Waited another long time for the ordered beers to come out. We ordered 2 orders of potato pancakes as appetizers . The pancakes were no more than 3 inches wide and maybe an 1/8 inch thick. A nickels worth for $7.95 an order. The most upsetting  experience however was after finishing our appetizer and waiting another long time(remember the place was nearly empty) the waiter comes back and said they are out of the sausages that 2 of us ordered. Where he or the kitchen were doing all this time while we were sitting waiting for our entrees to arrive I could not begin to guess.  Food was good but we will not be back due to the very poor service. The wait staff looked like they wanted to be somewhere else and did not enjoy their jobs.vgu"}
{"text":"I love this place -- for some reason, German food doesn't seem to have quite the draw of, say, Italian, but I think that's because most people haven't tried the real thing. Haus Murphy's does it right. 

If you're worried about whether you'll enjoy German cuisine, don't be. The chicken schnitzel with white wine sauce is an excellent place to start (if you need one -- if you don't, it's still delicious). Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My first time here to an Oktoberfest. Fun, fun, fun. A traditional German band leads everything from drinking songs (repetitive chants of, \"Raise your stein\") to dance events, stein holding contests, etc. You get the picture. But how they convert the back 40 of this small, downtown-Glendale, German restaurant to a beer garden is something to be applauded. The weather is perfect in late October, the music transcending, the food fantastic and the beer and wine free-flowing. 

Well-done Haus Murphy's, well-done."}

{"text":"My favorite treat! It is in old town glendale right in the middle of all the boutiques and stores. Oktoberfest is going on right now so don't miss it! The bald bartender in the back makes the best drinks so don't forget to say hello! I always come in and get the kilometer , potato pancakes and a desert. lol I get the same thing every time but it is just as good every time. Service is usually 1000 times better in the back with the bartender... but that has just been my experience. Love this place."}
{"text":"I never had a schnitzel before... now I can cross it off my bucket list. This place was sweet. Brought my lady and my dog here. We got a nice spot on the patio and enjoyed some German made craft beer. We shared a pretty delicious stuffed mushroom appetizer and a plate of steak schnitzel. I never thought I would say something good about Germans after the Holocaust,  but this place is legit! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening with friends. Our waiter John was very personable and answered all of our questions and offered recommendations as well. Three different entrees and all were delish. Portions are huge & we each left with a box but we still had to share the cherry strudel & enjoyed it to the last bite.
I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere , a lot of German in this place. However the food was a disappointment. Beef Roulade was tasty, but meat was dry. Weiner Schnitzel was a dried out slab of meat, breaded and possibly laying on a plate in the kitchen for a while. Precooked and then reheated. Not freshly fried for sure. No additional lemon based gravy, made for a super dried out experience. Potatoes were too mushy. Apfel Strudel was very good, but obviously over hot from a microwave 'heat-up' before serving.  We don't need to go back. We did love the accordian and tuba players, they were great!  PS, I am German and I know my german food!"}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon for dinner and it did not disappoint!  First time having German food and we will be back for sure!  Had the paprika schnitzle...sooo good.  Hubby had the guiness brats that he said were amazing.  There were 7 of us and not one complaint!  Tried the bread pudding, cherry streudle and apple streudle for dessert.  Until next time Haus Murphey's!"}
{"text":"On my recent road trip I was looking for a German restaurant online and Haus Murphy's popped up. My friend and I are German, living in America and thought a good old Schnitzel would be a nice blast from the past.
We ordered the giant Pretzel which was very good and the beer was very good also.
my friend ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel which is a Pork Schnitzel with a mushroom sauce. The Wiener Schnitzel was so dry and over-fried that he needed 5 Lemon wedges to make this eatable. And my Jaeger Schnitzel was completely burned. Black on the bottom. Not brown but black. The cook must have thought that I would not notice with sauce on top. The Sauce was so thick it was terrible. It tasted like it was some instant powder sauce but since I have not seen the preparation, I can not vouch for that. All in all we left pissed and angry what some people sell as good German food to Americans. I was embarrassed.
And how can this be recommended in the show Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins?

OH... The waitress was great. Very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"The two stars are for service only.  Otherwise, the food does not get stars at all.  What have you done, Haus Murphy???  I've been coming to this restaurant since before it moved to its current location.  I lived in Germany for nearly 4 years, and the food was amazing.  I found Haus Murphy when I moved here and was overjoyed that the Schnitzel was very close to the \"real\" Schnitzel in Pruem, GE.  But, someone has gotten hold of the ingredients.  Perhaps the quality and pride in the food got lost somewhere in all the times the restaurant has changed hands.  They have either decided to cut back on good, quality ingredients, or just don't care anymore.  My last two visits left me wanting.  As another reviewer put it, the food used to be really good, but now it's \"meh.\"  The only good part of the meal was the mushroom demi glace.  THAT was really good, and covered up the blandness of the dish.  The portions have really been cut back, as well.  Tiny bit of potatoes.  No bread basket anymore, unless you pay for it (way too much money), and the dessert was bland and too gooey.  Strudel crust is supposed to be flaky and crisp!   Service was excellent., however.  We sat on the patio, and some moron allowed his two little daughters to run up and down the patio, screaming and dodging in and out of the tables and wait staff.  One waiter was terrorized by these brats, as he had to swerve several times to avoid colliding with them.  He was nearly tripped with full plates in his hands, but never changed his expression.  Just carried on.  (People, please teach your children how to behave in a restaurant!! )  I know we won't be going back.  Husband was NOT happy with the amount of the bill compared to the unremarkable food.   I'm sad."}
{"text":"Just did a true brau house experience tonite for 21 folks.
Cost was 25 each. But for starters and light main meal and beer it was a great holiday treat!"}
{"text":"Having grown up with a German mother who made great German food, I'm always skeptical of German restaurants.  I'd heard and read good things about Haus Murphy's so we decided to try it.  We were very pleasantly surprised!  The food was the best I'd had this side of mom's.  I had the Roladen and my girl friend had the Paprika Schnitzel - both were excellent.  The side dishes were good to above average and the beer we chose at the suggestion of our waiter, John (sp?), was also excellent.  John was engaging, friendly, and very helpful in all respects, without being intrusive.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"only place in the valley that I can get my schnitzel fix, tasty home made Spätzle too, haven't had a bad experience, been there about 10 times. sorry they stopped opening for lunch though"}
{"text":"My first time tour of historic Glendale was interupted when I stepped into the beer garden to enter this charming German restaurant!  I felt like I was at a German grandmother's home.  The decor was quaint and Bavarian, which I know from having spent time in Bavaria, and Munich for Oktoberfest!

The waitress we had was so helpful, we asked what she would order, and she shared her faves, amongst them which I enjoyed were the stuffed mushroom apps, and the Pear Bratten Sandwich, so yummy!  You can mix the sweet of fruit with the savory that lies within this yummy sandwich.  I chose fries as the side, and they were really yummy, unlike regular fries showing up at most restaurants.  

I enjoyed the Spaten Lager, the small still made a large beer for me, but I was in Bavarian heaven today!  Our lunch was 2 hours, it was so comfortable to just sit, enjoy chit chat, the food, and not feel rushed to leave, as would be the case being invited into a German home for lunch.  Danke Schoen Haus Murphy's, we will meet again!"}
{"text":"Their hours are incorrect both on Yelp, Google, and other sites. They seem to change the hours sporadically, so be sure to call ahead if you decide to visit. I made the mistake of not calling ahead today, assuming that I could trust the information they list on restaurant, review, and social media sites. When I called to inquire after arriving to a darkened and empty restaurant I spoke to a very rude employee who informed me of their sporadic schedule, opening at 4 PM on random days for random reasons, opening at 12 PM on other days for other reasons. When I mentioned that they should include that information online, he replied as sarcastically as can be, \"Yeah, we'll get right on that.\" If their food is anything like their customer service and spotty hours, I'd stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Best german food ever! Great service. Has that feeling you're at your german grandmothers kitchen table."}
{"text":"Great food, fun place, the best beer tour anywhere.

A little pricey for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"SO DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE IN JUNE, JULY OR AUGUST...well any other time too!! I know...I was here on June 26, 2015. The other months will get worse. 

The fact that they sat me in a loud room next to the bar under the TV when I requested a quieter area for a meeting I was about to have did not trigger thoughts of a Yelp review. 

The fact that they did not have the tables ready for our group that we reserved weeks in advance did not illicit a yelp review. 

The fact that they are housed within some sort of cell proof bunker did not trigger thoughts of yelp reviews until my kids were having problems and trying to get help. But when I was on hold getting help for the kids the scheißekopf playing his umpaloomp tuba right behind my head while I was holding on the phone waiting for my drink triggered thoughts of standing up knocking him on his fat rump and beating him with his shiny tootdalou. 

The fact that the food was not as good as I anticipated definitely triggered the need for a Yelp review. But I was having fun. I was having my meeting and I didn't have time for that yelping stuff. 

But at the middle of the meal when the entire room heated up to about 90+ degrees and everyone at the table was complaining about the heat sweating to death and das fräulein mentions the AC was as cool as it goes and I lost all my appetite because I was getting sick from the heat is the final moment when I had it with this place. 

Do you want good German food...check out the places in Mesa. There are several. They are authentic. They have better food. They have better atmospheres. They have ACs. And they don't have a scheißekopf on a tuba being rude to their patrons. 

Just say NEIN to this pathetic place...I was there...I know for a fact!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been in the restaurant industry for a combined 22 years, I have never witnessed such atrocious service anywhere.. Waited 15 minutes after we  were sat, no one acknowledged us, even though multiple servers and the manager made eye contact with me. We were patient, a simple someone will be with you would have been nice. Another patron asks their server if he can help us, 5 minutes later he takes our order. Our appetizer comes out before our drinks. Not a real big deal for me. 30 minutes later, still no entrees. Our server walks up asks if we've gotten our food, I tell him no. He proceeds to tell us the kitchen is super busy. Meanwhile 3 tables that sat after us had eaten their appetizers and were on to their entrees. It was apparent as a server he forgot to order our food. 30 minutes after  our food arrived. That's an hour wait for entrees. The food was pretty good..My boyfriend asked for a refill on an arnold palmer, he didn't get it until reminding the server at the end of the meal. He was just a kid so I felt for him he seemed kind of busy. The worst part was the manager who sat on the patio and didn't help any of the guests or the servers, who all seemed a little busy. I could not believe how uninvolved or how little she seemed to care about her guests experience. At our work, our managers are always aware of whats going on, how long people have been waiting, if they are greeted in a timely manner and will personally talk to tables when those situations ever arise. I would never want to work for such a lazy manager, who doesn't take pride in the running of the business or ensuring guest satisfaction. We will NEVER dine there again!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSg

Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a \"waiting area\".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA

After about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the \"bier garten\".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.

SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.

Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.

As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an \"Oom-pah-pah band\"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbA
They starting with \"roll out the barrel\" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!

FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a \"lemon martini\" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly \"disappeared\" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!

DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the \"sauerkraut cake\" (A chocoholics dream!).

OVERALL: it was an awesome evening with wonderful food and a great German atmosphere!  4.5 stars rounded up!"}
{"text":"They were really busy the night we were there but we had plenty of great German beer to take up the slack. My Weiner Schnitzel was excellent and my husband loved his Roulades! All wait persons were attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"Horrible first impression. Deplorable service.deserved much more for $100 bill for 2 people"}
{"text":"Great German food! Love the traditional(-ish) music on the weekends. The pretzels are amazing. Also love their schnitzel. This place will make you nostalgic for Germany!"}
{"text":"The Jager schnitzel with German fried potatoes and sauerkraut was delicious.   Also,  the gulasch was very good.  The warm bread basket was very good, too.  The beer could have been colder, but Germans don't really drink it cold.   Will definitely go back again many times."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get a German beer on tap. Their appetizers are awesome from potato pancakes, to a Giant Bavarian pretzels, to the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had.  Their schnitzels are good and their Chocolate saurkraut cake is delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Haus Murphy's and was pleasantly surprised.  My friend and I went for lunch, I ordered the chicken schnitezel, the chicken was perfectly breaded (not too much not too little) and was moist and tender and just the right amount of sauce, it wasn't drowning in it.  My dinning partner ordered the original bratwurst and you can tell it was home made.  My order came with a side of green beans and french fries, the french fries I found odd, maybe spaetzle would be a better side. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing, you knew you were not in a German restaurant.  Both my friend and I are looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Way over priced!! The food was average at best. The worst is the meatloaf......the best the paprika schnitzel. Go only for the beer and the nights they have entertainment. They had a tuba and an accordion player there that got the restaurant singing along, so that was fun."}
{"text":"A few years ago, when antiquing with my hubbie and mother in-law, I suggested Haus Murphy for lunch.  For some reason that remains absolutely unfathomable to me, my mother in-law wrinkled her nose at it and ended up following the hubbie's stupid lead to Bitzee Mama's mexican restaurant, where she ordered a non-Mexican item because she doesn't really eat Mexican food.  Needless to say, Bitzee Mama's remains to this day my #1 trip into dining hell.

This time, the hubbie was more amenable to visiting Haus Murphy and does have that regret that he poo-poo'd it  ... 'my mom would have liked this place.'

We started with the stuffed mushrooms and loved them.  We both got schnitzel, me a pork paprika and him a chicken.  Loved both our dishes.  Only drawback, we assumed the german potato salad would be served by default.  The waitress did not ask, we did not volunteer, so we got french fries.  We did not get dessert because the pieces of cake we saw going out were HUGE and we were full.

It was a beautiful February day, so we sat outside.  We will definitely dine here again when in Glendale."}
{"text":"Best German restaurant in AZ! If you're looking for awesome sausage and fresh food with a German twist, this is the place. Best Oktoberfest in AZ too"}
{"text":"Best German food in town!!!!  Highly recommend the platter for two!  Has everything from schnitzel to sausage to yummy potatoes and cabbage...mmm mmm gooood!"}
{"text":"Wunderbar!

This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in metro Phoenix.  I've been there 3 times now and have loved each visit.  On two of the visits I sat at the patio area.  On both nights it was chilly but they keep propane heaters going that really warm the place up (you might not want to sit too close to them as they give off a lot of heat) the other time I sat at the bar watched a game whilst drinking German beer and eating a giant Bavarian pretzel.

Haus Murphy's has great atmosphere and darn good food.  The above mentioned pretzel is a must and goes great with the German mustard.  Their mustard has a great kick and will clear any nasal passage.  As far as the entrees I have had the sauerbraten and the schweinebraten and enjoyed both.

The German beer selection tops anything I've seen in Phoenix thus far.  I recommend the Konig Ludwig Hefeweizen.

Service was great every visit.  Kudos to the manager who dealt with a fussy customer at the table across from mine during my last visit.  She took it all in stride and didn't let if phase her one bit.  Very professional even when being wronged.

I can't praise them enough.  I'd give them 5 stars but I've been to a German restaurant elsewhere that was better (no fault to Haus Murphy's, the other place is that amazing).  It's especially nice this time of year since you can sit out on the patio and take in the Glendale Glitters while enjoying a great meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best German food!!!  Great entertainment!  Family owned and op.  My husband and I travel to Arizona once a year to watch a football game and go to Haus Murphy's.  Wish we had a place like this in Orange County, CA.  Octoberfest is amazing!  December is fun too - Glendale Glitters!  Try the bread pudding, get it with ice cream...delicious"}
{"text":"OK, I am totally biased, as I used to work here.
That being said, it has some of the best food EVER.
If you ever are there for Hungarian Stew nite (which is rarely made), order nothing else but a bucket of it, it is that good. The schnitzel with ham and cheese is excellent, but I always had a to go order of the chicken with the mushroom cream sauce-swear they put crack in it. 
Sausages galore!
My friend, who worked there for many years, even made a poem about all the types of sausage available. 
The sauerkraut IS THE BEST IN THE WHOLE FREAKIN' WORLD! Seriously. I would eat soup containers of it.
My fav activity was filling the bread pudding glasses.
Scoop of bread for their glass, scoop of bread pudding for MY glass. 
If I wasn't busting my ass at this job, I soooo woulda been such a fatty....
Fried potatoes-Awesome. German salad-Delish. 
And I don't know if the Virshing is truly German, but it is truly awesome. 
It's cabbage with a mild cheese sauce, and it's served on most of the plates. Some don't like it, but I would sneak to go cups of just this, and eat it in back of the beer garden with the pumpernickel bread.
Last, but by no means least, the Reuben at lunch is the bestest. Go. Eat it. You won't be sorry....
OK, 1 more thing:
I spent an entire summer drinking my way through our kegs of Weihanstephan Korbinian, a seasonal beer that is very good, but VERY hard to find (alas). 
Whether you prefer the Dunkel, or the FrancisKaner, they 
are all delicious glasses of Heaven.....and I'm done..."}
{"text":"Changed from 4 stars to 1. ( see previous review ) they must be back to the same terrible Chef and it's overpriced) please hire people who actually know how to cook German food. 




Wow. What a difference. I came here last year and was disgusted. Being German and moving to the USA as an adult I know how German food should taste like and this was an embarrassed.  
Since this place was still better than the other German place (Black Forest) we decided to try it again.  What a pleasant surprise. The food was very tasty. 
So I realized why the change...they now  actually have a German chef instead of a non German chef  which they had for years. Also, the staff was very friendly and attentive and prices were great.   The only reason I gave 4 instead of five stars is b/c they did not offer a choice between soup or salad and just served Egg Drop Soup which was ok; however, on a hot summer evening I would have preferred a choice.  What an improvement!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Es schmeckt sehr lecker!

That's German!

I have been to Haus Murphy's to drink a few times in the past and was quite pleased by the beer selection as well as the size. I can get beer in a stein the size of my head? Surely you jest. I have a rather large melon. It is true though. The effer is huge and tasty.

I finally got to eat here with my favorite collection of Brite girls. The whole place feels rather authentic though I have never been to  Germany so what do I know? Everything I know about Germany I learned from Polka and online pornography (I think they love the Hoff).

 Community tables were not uncomfortable as they can be other places. They were quite cozy and enjoyable in fact.

The food while unpronounceable was very delicious. In fact I have been told that my opening line means \"It's delicious\" however as previously stated I know nothing of German so it could very well mean *insert funnt profane thing here*

Sauerkraut has become one of my favorite things in the world  and It does not disappoint here. The sausages were delicious and the beer made it all just a happy dining sort of day.

Also how can you go wrong with two old men in lederhosen playing the oompah oompah on a tuba and an accordion. These guys are rock stars. You learn to play these instruments solely to get chicks.

Srsly...I know you uppity east sider kids like to stear clear of the avenues except to take in some hipster-slumming it culture, but downtown Glendale has so much to offer. Haus Murphy's is amazing and it is nestled amongst little antique shops and whatnot with brick and lace and charm. Give it a shot. 

Tell them \"Du hast meine Katze auf dem Fenster geworfen!\""}
{"text":"As I walked the streets of downtown Glendale, the Oom-Pah music wafting down the alleyways let me know what I was in for: GOOD TIMES.

You really could come here just to drink.There's a full-fledged beer garden outdoors on the side of the restaurant where a band was set up, playing traditional polka which goes great with beers. Even though we're in the desert it was pretty chilly out there so we opted to stay indoors. Bring a sweater just in case.

Vegetarians beware! You're not gonna find much to eat here. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms (stuffed with meat, of course) as an appetizer, the bauernplatte combo, a GIANT BEER (a one liter mug of their darkest, the Optimator), and for dessert, a slice of black forest cake. oh, and some GOOD TIMES.

We came real hungry and the portions did not disappoint. The stuffed mushrooms were not only pretty to look at, they were also huge and very delicious. I could see someone ordering this appetizer and making it a meal just by itself. Not having been here before, or properly indoctrinated into German cuisine, my wife and I decided that the combo for two would be a good start: spicy bratwurst (my fave), German bratwurst (also good!), weisswurst (least fave), a kassler kotelett (fried and flavorful) and some pork schnitzel, with (THE BEST) sauerkraut, red cabbage (so good!), fried potatoes (yes!) and some German potato salad (YES!) on the side. Like I said, we were hungry, and managed to put a dent into little over half that platter. Our server initially brought me out the wrong beer, which was sorta funny because I had asked him for a recommendation, and it had to have passed through his head as he was lugging this huge mug to my table. I did taste it before I sent it back, and it was good, but when the Optimator showed up, all was right with the world (I kind of get excited when I walk into a place and there's beers on tap that I haven't tried, and even more so when they turn out to be amazing)! To finish the meal off we thought, \"Ah, what the hell,\" and split a piece of the black forest cake, which was pretty good, but next time I wanna try the strudel. 

Haus Murphy's is an institution, and we will definitely be back with a full crew to put this place to the test. I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Arizona as far as the menu, the ambiance, the fantastic beers, and the aforementioned GOOD TIMES."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pretty sure I just experienced Germany on a plate, in a glass and from a restaurant....all from downtown Glendale, Az."}
{"text":"A pretty good German place. Zany culture mixed with a few American icons and a (usually) pretty blizzard music selection makes this a fun and unique atmosphere. Liter beer steins and German sausages are plentiful here, how could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Being German, I'm always on the lookout for a good German restaurant. I'm always skeptical of reviews because you never know if it's someone who never had German food, someone who's been to Germany once and thinks only the food they tried was authentic, or real Germans who are biased towards their regional tastes. 

My opinion is that the food here is usually great but can be hit or miss. Be sure you are prepared to spend some time at the here. It's not a place to stop in for a \"quick\" bite for dinner.  

Oktoberfest is a blast at this location and I try not to miss it. They've had the same band flown in from Germany the last few years and they are a riot."}
{"text":"I ordered and ate the Beef Roulade this evening at this establishment. The beef was very tough and not very appetizing. 

The Spatzle and cabbage were good.

The service was good.

{"text":"My hubby and I Love to come to Haus Murphy's for date night, the atmosphere is wonderful. The servers are always fantastic, even if they are very busy. The food is amazing. I know it's hard with the portion sizes, but Try to save room to dessert! If You Love Chocolate go for the Sauerkraut chocolate cake, it's gigantic and don't let the name throw you, trust me it doesn't taste like sauerkraut, just delicious chocolate. Now my persona Must have is their Amazing Bread Pudding- Never liked it Before I had it at Haus murphys, it's just amazing! This is a great restaurant in the heart of downtown Glendale and I Highly Recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were from out of town for a convention and looking for something different.  After a quick search of the area Haus Murphy's came up and we are so glad it did.  Right now they have an anniversary special that is amazing!  The waiter was awesome and helped a couple people in our group navigate the beer list and find something to their liking (which is amazing since they don't usually like beer).  Everyone in our group was very impressed we will all be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding German food and beer in an authentic biergarten outside or cozy restaurant inside. Very friendly service, too. I don't think much of most restaurants in Arizona, but this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. The beer on tap was great and the food was so good. We ordered the combo platter for two so we can try a little of everything and it was all good. The schnitzel was great and not greasy ( unfortunately I have had super greasy schnitzel and brauts at other places). We polished off the meal with the apple strudel and vanilla ice cream. The strudel was amazing."}
{"text":"Considering I am not a big German cuisine aficionado this visit was to entertain a Customer that recommended and wanted dinner at this establishment. Prior to arrival I had done my typical review on YELP. Service was good, food OK, certainly not bad, beer excellent and the chocolate sauerkraut cake for desert was enough for three of us to share. Highly recommend the cake - it may be the best ever!"}
{"text":"I had the potato pancakes and they were super good! I liked the inside with all of the german decor!"}
{"text":"Drove early to chocolate festival so we could have lunch here as we rarely get to the west side. Couldn't try them though because they shut down around noon because their  kitchen was overloaded. I guess they didn't know about the festival but how could they not?"}

Sauerbraten and red cabbage was real good, spatzle was ok seemed a bit water logged, but not bad."}
{"text":"So we decided to go back on a slow night.  I added another star because the service was warm and attentive.  Schnitzel (pork) not veal ugh! Was hot this time my partner's Brats were good as well.  German potato salad was okay, sauerkraut on my plate was bland on his plate was good??? Why the inconsistency? I refuse to believe the laws of physics differ from plate to plate.  Restaurant area is old school charming."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I was NOT thrilled when my husband let me know that his friends from work had chosen this place for dinner. For the most part I think stuff like brats and sausage are GROSS (with the exception of a little hide the sausage. lol) and German food to me just sounded weird with the schnitzels and spatzles and kraut, etc. but I decided I could at least have the cesar salad.  I'm so happy I decided to branch out and try something new.  I had the steak schnitzel (a schnitzel, I learned, is a lean boneless piece of meet ... steak, veal, pork or chicken, breaded and fried) which was covered in a Gorgonzola sauce...it came with a side of German friend potatoes and green beans with bacon/onions.  All of it was very tasty!  I split mine with my hubby and he shared his Schweitzer schnitzel (pork with a layer of ham and swiss cheese) with me.  His came with wirsing which turned out to be a cabbage and cheese dish that sounded awful but tasted great!  The service was wonderful....there were 16 people in our party and we never felt we had to flag anyone down for service.  The place was HUGE but did not appear so from the street and it was completely packed so they must be doing something right! The only thing I'd suggest is that they add a little \"glossary\" to the front of the menu for those of us (pretty much our whole table) who didn't know what the various dishes were.  That would free up the servers for more important stuff than explaining all those crazy names of dishes!!!!  I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"This is always a fail safe when we cannot decide where to go to eat and it NEVER let's us down....great for the family!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food specifically the Pretzel Schnitzel, quick service & the price is right. The portions are huge & can totally be shared. Can't wait to go back. I had this bookmarked on Yelp for quite sometime & never am in the area. However Glendale Glitters was happening & we went. So we knew we had only one place to go & we loved it. Only downside was they were packed to the rooftops which is great for them & yay they'll be open forever I hope... but a little on the noisy side & they had already run out of potato cakes. Super sad faces. Oh well totally our bad. It was after 8 p.m. on a Glendale Glitters weekend. I'll be back & report back. Can't wait. I love me some kraut. Yum! Also apparently they had been on DDD but didn't know till we got there. So funny. I found the place after returning from Chicago & eating some German & Polish foods & loved it. So I wanted to come home & keep trying more. So happy I did."}
{"text":"We went there looking for Eisbein and were happy to be able to get them. Nice choice of beers too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great beer. We ordered the meal for two and it was soooo much food. Enjoyed the live band while it lasted and outdoors was perfect with the lighting. Good service, polite staff and yummy sausage. Pork was a little dry but not bad, everyyhing else was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day dinner. We had fun, but a lot of the fun had to do with the people dining and serving there. The food was good, no complaints. We had two huge beers that we both couldn't finish. The music sets the tone - unique folky [German] music I am guessing. The decor is rather thrown-together and pretty random; there is definitely plenty to look at. I think they have patio seating too, so I'd recommend that because you can people watch on Glendale which is great!"}
{"text":"We are going to Germany for 2 weeks thought we would give it a try food was good had their anniversary special which was perfect gave a sample of the food for the price it was well worth it. If you are wanting to try German food give this place a try."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. I'm excited for this little gem during our very busy Pro-Bowl and SuperBowl season. It's right in the heart of Glendale and is a real find. 

We had the stuffed cabbage and the apple desert (fritter?) Both were heavenly. The stuffed cabbage has a flavorful sauce that finishes it off perfectly. The sausage/beef stuffing was seasoned just right and complemented the entire dish. When we got to the dessert, I didn't think I would have any. My boyfriend ordered it and I said I would have a tiny taste. WOW! Fabulous! It's a big dessert, big enough for two people. And I had far more than a 'taste.' Exquisite. That's all. Exquisite.  Oh, and the beer menu is good. I had a red beer (I already forget what it was, but it was rich and full-bodied and was a good accompaniment to the food and the mood.

The ambiance in the restaurant is wonderful. It definitely feels like you have slipped into Germany. We sat outside in the courtyard. With the heaters it was very comfortable. The decor is greatl and sets the mood. The singer (Al) was great. He went from country to jazz to soft rock to pop with ease. He knew so many songs I was blown away. The Manager was very attentive doubling as our waiter. He knew his beers and the menu well, and he obviously loves his job. 

I'll tell you how great this is... my BF is a chef and he went out of his way to go back into the kitchen to compliment the chef and kitchen team. I highly recommend this. If you are here in Phoenix for all the festivities, make sure and add this to your list of restaurants. You will thank me later! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic German food in the valley, go to Haus Murphy. It's the wurst!

Large mugs of German beer are the perfect match for the big pretzels and spicy mustard. These are must-orders, especially if you arrive hungry. My one complaint was that the kitchen was so slammed that it took an hour for our food to arrive.

Once it did, it didn't last on the table long. We devoured a variety of sausages, schnitzels and potato pancakes. The traditional kraut and red cabbage fit in nicely with the traditional meat-gasm items.

Live polka, good beer and plenty of sausage. You'll swear you left Glendale and actually made it to Munich."}
{"text":"First, in response to the folks who complained about food dripping with grease- I did not at all experience anything like that. Is the food authentic? Jein.... They seem to have taken German recipes and adapted them to American tastes. Good? Absolutely. If I want German and don't want to drive to far east mesa, this is definitely the place. The beer is good, even if they do insist on adding fruit to the German beer... In Germany, that's a no-no except wIth a filtered wheat (slice of lemon) or a radler (sparkling lemonade). I did enjoy sitting on the bar and watching a soccer game- and the music was perfect wiesn musik!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The environment was authentic, the staff was knowledgable and the beer was cold! 

I ordered what was featured on Diners, Drive In and Dives and was definitely not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here for the International Supper Club. I have never had German food before. I sure am glad this was my first experience. It was so delicious. Hats off to our waiter Patrick for dealing with our large group. We took up two tables. He did a great job even with that many people. Sure it was a little slow but it was worth the wait and he did a great job remembering who got what. I felt bad bombarding him with that many people but he still did a fantastic job.
I loved the food. And the large beers. That was a beer. Wooo good stuff. I got the paprika schnitzel on a recommendation. I can't describe how good it was. Words don't do it justice. Plus the boiled cabbage coleslaw stuff, whatever it was called, blew my mind. I could have had a whole plate of that stuff. Best GD coleslaw I have ever had. Lol. But put the schnitzel on another plate because I don't want to miss out on that either. I was full but wanted to eat more. So I did. The chocolate truffle cake was amazing too. Between the company, the amazing food, the awesome beer in the huge glass I had a great time.
I will definitely be back with a large or small group. Even though it is a little far away from where I live it is worth the drive. I can't say enough about how good it was."}
{"text":"1st time there.  Service was very good very friendly.  Food was excellent huge portions.  Very good German food. I definitely want to return"}
{"text":"Several times they've run out of things like the pretzels and condiments... disappointing service and long waits even then."}
{"text":"First time to this German restaurant was great.  Our server was Angela and she was great.  Since everything on the menu sounded good, she suggested the sampler type platter.  It is three different sausages, schnitzel, smoked pork chop, sauerkraut, purple cabbage, and German potatoes. Make sure you get the gravy!!!!  Of course, we had some German beer to go with our supper. Fed the two of us, and had leftovers!

We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The three of us went for dinner on a Saturday evening at about 7.  We sat outside and were immediately served by our waitress.  She made several beverage selections that were spot on.  We initially ordered the mushroom appetizers, but quickly added the pretzel and deep fried pickles stuffed with cheese. Trying to keep one foot on the floor while reaching for seconds on these tasty morsels was quite a challenge.  Another bonus was it was dog friendly. The band was fun as they puffed away on their tubas, even playing Johnny Cash and other surprising favorites."}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. Service was horrible. Our waiter barely paid attention to us and they were not even that busy. He never checked on us and never even refilled our waters until we chased down a busser to get his attention. We waited over 30 minutes just to place our order being that he forgot that we hadn't ordered. Service makes a big difference, and with great food it was really a bummer to have such a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is just a great place to take my German relatives when they are visiting.  Love that German patatoe salad and sweet smell of sauerkraut."}
{"text":"Beer selection is pretty good- quite a few good German beers to try. The food is great too, I really enjoyed the paprika schnitzel. The downside here was the service. The waitress was incredibly slow. I think we waited 20 minutes for our beer and appetizers after we ordered them and she did not come around to ask if we wanted refills on the beers until we were all done eating. It was not a busy night either, which was disappointing. Overall great food but extremely slow service."}
{"text":"I love the live music and atmosphere on the patio.

The service was good and so was the food. We gad potato pancakes and a pretzel for appetizers. The pretzel was fantastic and the potato pancakes were ok, but not as good as my grandmother's.

I shared the combo for 2 with a friend. The sausage and ham were fab and the little salad was one of the best I have ever had. The ony thing we didn't like was the 
meatloaf type thing on the combo platter.

The place cleared out pretty quicly Saturday night... By 9pm, people were packing up the patio.

Overall, it was a great time. I only wish there were some more veggie options for sides."}
{"text":"Had the Sweitzer schnitzel. They changed the recipe and now put the ham and swiss on top instead of inside, which makes the ham chewy. Thw wirsing is also not quite as tangy. It's still a good meal but no longer a great one."}
{"text":"Love this authentic German restaurant. After we saw it on an old Diners Drive-Ins and Dives rerun we decided to go.
Went on a Friday (we did make reservations for 6pm). When we arrived there was not too many people there and we sat on the bar side. Glad we did. There was an accordion player and a tuba player playing the typical German \"oompa\" type music. And they were in lederhosen It was awesome. By the time we left (7:00 7:15) it was starting to get busy.
With all their menu choices it was hard for us to choose but we decided on the Giant Pretzel appetizer and a dinner sampler plate for two (sorry don't recall the name of it) that had schnitzel, 2 kinds of kraut, german meatloaf, potatoes, spaetzle, and a smoked pork chop. We loved it all. Both my wife and I have German ancestry and this is some of the foods we remember our grand parents making. The giant pretzel had a side of spicy brown mustard that I just loved. We couldn't finish these ginormous portions so unfortunately we couldn't try he desert. We did take it home and it was tasty the next day as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place...every time I go there, I keep meaning to try a different entree, but I can't tear my appetite away from the *excellent* gnocchi!...thus far, I've tried (by picking at other peoples' food) the potato pancakes, the mushroom soup, jager schnitzel, bratwurst, and the German chocolate cake...all incredible and ridiculously filling...and the waiters have been so friendly(not to mention, rather good looking haha)..."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Haus Murphy's.  service was just alright, but the food was fantastic!  I got the classic German Bratwurst which was served with sauerkraut and German fried potatoes.  The Brat was flavorful and juicy.  Sauerkraut was sour and tangy.  Potatoes were a little greasy but delicious nonetheless.  My parents split a platter which came with a Brat, Jaeger Schnitzel, some beef patty thing, stuffed chicken medallions, and potatoes and sauerkraut.  It was a great deal for $18!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had 6:30 reservations for A Saturday night and arrived at that time.  We were told there would be a wait.  Grrrrrr!  After waiting for several minutes, we were told a table would be ready in minutes.  Oops, sorry there is another party ahead of you.  Grrrrrr!
After complaining, we were finally seated.  The waitress came over and put 2 bread plates on the table.  Since the appetizers were uninteresting, we ordered a couple of beers.  Several minutes later she came by and said the bar was backed up and she would go check.  In the meantime, she came back for our dinner order.  We both ordered different schnitzels.  Finally beer came, along with the soup.  Grrrrrr!
After a couple spoonfuls of soup, here comes the entrees.  Timing and service was terrible.  Food was average.  Never figured out what the bread plates were for.  I had also advised the waitress it was my son's birthday thinking she would send the Oompah Band by, but no.  This was the downer of our otherwise wonderful trip to AZ for Rangers Spring Training...."}
{"text":"after seeing a worker actually flossing her teeth in the kitchen.............................no thanks, not a place I'll go back to - shame after the praise it got on Triple D"}
{"text":"I've only  had German food twice in my life and Haus Murphy's was my second time.  With that said, I really liked the place!  We had the potato pancake and my 1/8 German daughter went to town with it!  We also had the schnitzel I think is what it's called (the breaded meat) and that was AWESOME.  I can't remember the name of the sausage but that was good, too.  The beef portion of the dish was meh.  Kind of dry but maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  LIke I said, I don't know much about German food!

The service was OK.  We had to ask for a high chair like 3 times but they were nice about it.  When our FIL comes to town we will take him here to give it a try.  It's definitely worth going to check out.  Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my third time eating here.  I will say this place is very good.  This trip was for a birthday party.  There were four of us and we went around 4 to avoid the dinner and lunch crowd.  
The server did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.  We ordered a couple of appetizers.  They were the brie with a glaze and the other was a sausage one.  They both were really good.  
I ordered that jaeger schnitzel and it was super good.  It came with potatoes and a side of what looked like a coleslaw.  The food was really good.  We ordered the cherry and apple strudels too when done.  The apple was really good.  They seem to be all natural (no sugar seem to be added).  It came with a side of whip cream that was good too.  
I would have like to have some beers but I was driving.  
The server did a great job and he got a good tip.  
Give this place a try.  I have a feeling you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good food. I had the Jaeger Schnitzel which came with potatoes and a cabbage and sour cream type side that was my favorite part. The Schnitzel was tender and the sauce on it was very flavorful. The potatoes were ok, nothing fantastic but good. We were a large group so I understand slower service so that isn't my complaint, my reason for not 5 stars is the waiter gave us a hard time about ordering any drinks while we waited for a few more people. The first table designated to us was full and he said he didn't want to take drink orders till everyone was there. He ended up doing it but wasn't to happy about it. That is fine but not great customer service. I have only been to one other German restaurant and I liked their food just slightly better but this was very good and I would return with a smaller party!"}
{"text":"YUM. One of our favorite restaurants!   An absolute referral.  Friendly staff.  Music is fun and so are the other diners.  Food is outstanding!   I've had German food elsewhere and it was heavy and greasy.  Not true here!  Very good filling food!   Go for the beer as well - authentic goodness.  Not cheap but worth it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be better.  Great atmosphere ... they had a band playing, the servers were in fun outfits, and there's a giant pretzel outside.  Unfortunately that's pretty much all this place has going for it.  The food was decent (I had the Jagerschnitzel which the staff raved about, and an apple strudel), and the beers were of course great.  Overall worth checking out if you're in Downtown Glendale, but I likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I ate beets.  How great is that!
I hate beets.

Quality vs Quantity
Quality vs Server Knowledge

Tough call on the rating.
Food taste was terrific thoughout.
German salad (included beets), soup with meal and sauerbraten.
All tasty.

The beets on the German salad were very tasty and I hate beets.
Server knowledge - I just had a beet epiphany and asked how they were prepared.  Shrug - they are beets.  Another person who brought my main course to the table equally clueless.

Bean soup included with the meal - delicious.

Sauerbraten, red cabbage and spaetzle very tasty.

However- barely ate lunch in anticipation of a beefy dinner.
2 thin slices of sauerbraten.  Seriously?

Sauerbraten should be a hearty meal, not a deli slice.

4 stars with a nod to a reasonable amount of meat.
5 stars if the waiter knew a few details about the food.

Return -  the schnitzels did sound awful good..........."}
{"text":"There was a festival in downtown Glendale and we were hungry so after we browsed some Yelp reviews, we decided to stop by Haus Murphy's. It was fairly busy, even at a later hour, but we were promptly seated. Our waitress came by and got us our drink order. We had ordered a couple of beers, which took a while for them to come but they were pretty good as expected.

I will preface this review by saying that I've never had German food before so I didn't really know what I was in for. We were really hungry so we started with the mushroom appetizer dish. It was definitely interesting - The filling was really mushy but flavorful; the cheese sauce it came with was the highlight on the plate. We also got the chicken schnitzel for our main meal. It was really bland / tasteless, mainly super greasy and sides that the meal came with weren't much better. Of course all of this was served up for a pretty pricey ticket. I'm not sure if I just don't like German food or what, but I don't see us coming back."}
{"text":"The hubby is half German, so whenever we can find German food, we have to have some.  This place is good.  Has a good Schnitzel( and big!).  We have been here twice and enjoyed both times.  We came yesterday and enjoyed the food.  
Had a Jagerschnitzel, and although it was good, the gravy was sparse and a bit bland.  My hubby had the ziguenerschnitzel, which was tasty.  Really enjoyed the potatoes and the new cabbage dish.
The service was good, price is still fine.  I saw in a previous review that someone grumped about the new menus.  Its not the menu that brings me into a place, its the food!"}
{"text":"So my German mother came in to town so we gave the Haus a try.  I enjoyed the deep fried brie very much, and she loved the potato pancakes.  Very good food, and fun atmosphere, even one a German mother can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had the Haus Goulash. Maybe my expectations were too high it was just ok. The meat seemed dry like it was made a week ago. Was really looking forward to trying this place. Will give it another shot and see if the schnitzel is fresh."}
{"text":"Great meal from the mint hot chocolate drink to the jäger schnitzel ( fried pork tenderloin with mushroom sauce) and fried potatoes.  Can't forget the great appetizers, stuffed mushrooms and Bavarian pretzel."}
{"text":"Ruben Sandwich and the Vodka pasta are delish!  I tried another dish that my hubby ordered and that was great too (don't remember what it was).  Also, the German margarita was good!  This place fits perfect in downtown Glendale!  We will Def return."}
{"text":"New to Phoenix and was looking or a good German restaurant.  Decided to try Haus Murphy's and glad I did.  Typical German decor, excellent service and the food was very good.  I had the Paprika Schnitzel but was unsure of the Paprika sauce.  The server was very cool and gave me a dish of the traditional beef mushroom sauce just in case.  They were both excellent.  We also tried the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel and that was very good as well.  Top it off with a liter of dark beer and it was a great dinner. The portions were so large we did not have room for desert but they looked like they would be good as well.

I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Most hospitable owner in town! Had the opportunity to stop in during December, Downtown Glendale has the light display so you expect it to be busy. Well, the wonderful owner first told us they were out of food, so busy, so sorry - wait a minute! She told us to be seated and asked us what to drink, proceeded to bring out two schnitzel plates, the last dishes in there - then she comped them! We had a wonderful meal, we are so glad we stopped in. Definitely will be visiting this place every chance we get!"}
{"text":"I've been to Haus Murphy's several times over the last few years. It has always been a great experience. The food is decently priced, the service has always been quick,  and the staff have always been extremely helpful.

With regard to the food, I have always been very pleased. The food is always fresh, portions are generous and the taste is amazingly authentic. If you are looking for a great German meal, you cannot go wrong with any selection.

On of the few downsides is that on days when downtown Glendale is having an event, the lunch menu is scrapped for a slimmed down dinner menu. This can be disappointing if you are looking forward to a lunch item. Luckily, their dinner menu has plenty of alternatives. If you live as far out as I do, just be sure and check Glendale's event calendar or call the restaurant. 

Also, be prepared to search for parking. Most spots are free, but depending on what is going on downtown, parking fills up fast."}
{"text":"We were shopping in Glendale and got a little hungry.  We decided to stop for a beer and pretzel in Haus Murphy's inviting bier garten.  Once we looked at the menu, however, we just HAD to order some lunch!  Everything looked so tempting!  We ordered Gulasch mit spatzel, Jager Schnitzel and beer.  Everything was delicious.  Both my parents are German so  I grew up on this type of cuisine.  The meal took me back to dinner at Oma's and Opa's house.  Wonderful comfort food!!  We didn't order dessert because we were really full from our entrees.  I'm looking forward to trying the sauerkraut chocolate cake next time!"}
{"text":"Being total novices to German cuisine- this was a great place to start.  Fun atmosphere from the restaurant decor to the servers attire and then we ordered!  We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely Glendale evening, a wonderful beir as suggested by our server and a giant German Pretzel hot out of the oven!  We relied on our server and ordered one of his suggestions- a combo meal with German sausage, smoked pork, potatoes and German potato salad (not as good as my Moms - but tasty) all was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We stopped in the middle of the afternoon. First, we ordered a pretzel with cheese. They were out of cheese. Then, we ordered the bratwurst with fries. They were out of fries. So, we ordered the bratwurst sandwich with potatoes. They were incredibly slow for it being a slow afternoon. Finally, our food came. The bratwurst had no bun. She explained they had no buns. I would think they could have offered a substitute or lowered our bill, but they didn't. I don't understand why they were out of basic staples for their restaurant. It made for a frustrating dining experience. The food was very average, as well as the service."}
{"text":"beer.. sausage.. pork patties.. potatoes.. pickled cabbage.
mmm then nap time.

anytime i find a german bier garden I try my hardest to get to it and considering i was only in AZ for a couple days i thought it was a good chance to try haus murphy's.. 

from the looks of things from pictures from other yelpers it looked promising.. 
figured i'd get some good beer and brats.

so by the time i made it out there i was starving and we still had to wait for 2 more people to show... this could have added to my crankiness because i think we waited for 30 minutes watching every car drive by.

it would have probably made me feel better to get a beer first but i didn't want to go in by myself considering the kitchen staff came out to stare while i was doing a walk through to check out what we were dealing with.

so most of the patrons had white/silver hair.. and it looked like they were celebrating life.

it's more homestyle than i thought it would be but when you hear beer garden and lounge.. you think it should be more happening but it was a thursday night in glendale and the place closes at 9.. i should have put it all together.

the place is huge.. it's actually the restaurant for the first half of the building then the backside is the lounge.. then alongside the entire building is the beer garden.

it was a nice nite out so we decided to stay outside in the beer garden.

the service is nice and helpful.. it's too bad the food didn't cut it.
their brats were spongy.. weisswurt had a different spice in it i couldn't put my finger on and the only sausage on the baunerplatte that was decent was knack wurst.. but that's just like a regular hot dog.

their mustard was just the generic haines spicy brown mustard... i think they could have made it much more authentic or gone with something with more flavor.. 

the schniztel was good.. but nothing more than a breaded cutlet.. which is what it is.. and i'd rather get it with donkatsu sauce at a japanese place.. the kossler kotelett.. is explained as a boiled pork chop.. which if you really think about it.. it's a slice of ham..  which it was.. and nothing too spectacular..

all the meats were pilled on top of either sauerkraut or pickled red cabbage and then on the sides of the plate were fried potatoes and the german potato salad.. nothing more than diner style fried potatoes.. but i did not get to try the potato salad because my non food adventurous friends got to it first.

the highlight is the atmosphere.. it's very welcoming and you have different sections to sit in depending on what you want to make of your night..

they have an awesome beer selection.. i wanted the spaten oktoberfest but they ran out and got me a different oktoberfest edition beer..
but the one that took the cake was the warstener dunkle.. 
it's a brown ale.. but it's so light and crisp you'd think it was a blonde.. 
it's absolutely delicious.. i was so jealous i didn't get it.. and even more so when my friend was billed $5 for his 32 oz and i had a 16 oz of the oktoberfest.. sheesh.. 
the other item i can vouch for is the soup of the day which was potato soup.. i didn't think i would care for it because we had the mount of potatoes and pickled cabbage.. but the soup was my favorite.. it was perfectly seasoned.. and pureed... and dipping their prebought buns into the soup was delicious.. it's a shame both the bread and the soup were the smallest in portion out of everything.

i still prefer red lion tavern in LA or hofbrauhaus in vegas...

but haus murphy's food did do the sleep trick.. i went back to my friends place and took a nap.. i don't know.. something about the beer and sausage mix that just makes me want to sleep right after.. it's worse than turkey dinners!

i forgot to mention they now serve absinthe.."}
{"text":"Wow. What has happened to this place? Talk about a downhill slide.

Went for dinner last week. Talked this place up to a family friend from out of town who is of German heritage. We were all excited to go. That faded quickly as soon as we walked up.

Usually there's a hostess to greet you next to the big pretzel. Been that way for years. This time, nobody, and it was far from being busy on a week night at 6pm. 2 tables occupied on the patio, and about a dozen tables inside. Walked around the entire restaurant like tards looking for someone to seat us. Finally found one of the regular waiters (of the 2 they had working that shift) to seat us. 

Menus have changed drastically from my last visit. Used to have a normal menu book, now those have been replaced with a poorly executed, Waffle House style placemat menu. Very low brow and a pain in the ass when you're flipping back and forth to decide on something. Only the beer/wine list page remains from the old menus. Thinned out a lot of the choices, too.

Ambience has changed a lot in the bar area. The place always could have used a makeover, and they did one, but went the wrong direction. The big banquet-style picnic tables are gone and in their place are horrible cheap retirement home-spec dining tables and chairs. Poorly painted German flag colors, a big tv, and no more interesting shit on the walls. Looks to me like they're trying to turn the back into a sports bar, but it's poorly executed.

Beer. Usually a highlight. Didn't even order one this time. They typically rotate a random beer in from time to time. I was told by our less than attentive and less than friendly waiter that they never do that. I guess I imagined the oddball, grapefruitish beer that I had never had before which my girlfriend ordered last time. Prices went up, too. Years ago, a liter was $9, now its $13-14. Entrees are also more, as is the pretzel. Didn't order one of those, either. 

I was pretty turned off by the service and atmosphere at this point, but I figured I'd let the food make up my mind. 

It did. And I'll never be back. My brat was dried out and overcooked. My girlfriends dish (pan fried chicken with some kind of sauce) was bland and the chicken was VERY dry. The red cabbage was flavorless and appeared/tasted canned, a far cry from how it used to be. My dad's stuffed cabbage dish was also flavorless, and we deduced that his entire dish is basically what gets mixed into their house soup every day. The \"German Potato Salad\" has devolved into fried potatoes with some chunks of bacon and parsley thrown in. Pathetic, and definitely not what it used to be.

We left at 7, horribly disappointed. The patio, which is usually pretty busy starting this time of year, was completely deserted when we walked out.

Haus Murphy used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, but their apparent attempt to appeal to the masses, coupled with a steady decline in service and quality, has left me to look elsewhere to find good German food."}
{"text":"Diners, Drive-ins and Disappointments

This is the fifth place Guy has gone in the valley and that I have tried and it was another so-so spot.

My wife and I are used to eating at Bavarian Point and Zur Kate in the east valley and enjoy both places.  We have also eaten at The Rheinlander in Portland a number of times.

We made the drive from Chandler to Glendale to try something new.  We started off with the Käse Spätzle which they say is German style Mac and Cheese.  The dish was good but had too much oinon, especially for a kids meal.

The kids also the chicken strips and fries.  They enjoyed the fries but the breading on the chicken was not kid friendly (my wife thought it was made with rye).

My wife and I had sausage plates, they were ok but unremarkable. The potato salad had very large chucks of potato that I wish were cooked a little more and the red cabbage was sweet, not tangy, and could have used some more simmer time.  The Speigl was great.

the food took close to an hour to make it to the table and the place was not busy.  We were told this was longer than usual but weren't given an explanation.  

The servers seemed friendly."}
{"text":"I had been anxious to visit this restaurant based upon the rave reviews from my son and his many visits with his German club.  I found the atmosphere to be delightful - I could picture myself in Germany based upon the decorations.  If you love to eat meat and like German cooking, this place is perfect.  I prefer non meat dishes but ended up having a steak cooked German style - it was very good.  Service was not exceptional, but was OK."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time last weekend and the food was very good.

The Paprika schnitzel was perfect and the sausage appetizer was excellent as well.

The only draw back, the two \"hosts\" were younger and disinterested. Almost as if they were put out by more customers. The waitress was a bit slow and forgetful but, the meal more than made up for it!

We would definitely go back for seconds!"}
{"text":"First time at Haus Murphey's and super impressed. Best German food since Germany. Had the paprika schnitzel and wife had the spicy bratwurst. Naturally we had to have a German beer too. Too bad we live in the SE Valley and it's a trek to get there or we would be there more often."}
{"text":"Love this place. Atmosphere is great, food fantastic, beer amazing, and the staff wonderful.  Have been here many times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had never tried authentic German food so this was an experience for sure. The place is nicely decorated and the staff was very helpful with their recommendations. My favorite was the gazpacho! I will definitely be coming back and trying something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   Took my husband for the sauerbraten that he had heard so much about and it did not live up to the hype. I had the special turkey schnitzel and the peaches were not fresh but canned and not grilled by any means. The meatloaf that another person had was very dry.  Service was good which is the reason for two stars and not one.   Wouldn't recommend. They obviously knew the food network was coming. Too bad the general public doesn't deserve the same quality."}
{"text":"Make sure you stop in for Beer, delicious food and  Gemutlichkeit! Carleen took care of us and her service was excellent ! Great oompapa ! Good times! Prosit"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The food was outstanding when you take into consideration that I have had this food in Germany. The roulade was delicious, however anyone who has had this dish knows that regular German mustard is a must. We actually had to ask for the mustard which came in Spicy German mustard. That maybe due to the fact that we live in the southwest region of the U.S. My wife is Austrian and she thoroughly enjoyed the roulade.  The  schaebischn Spatle was good.
My Paprika schnitzel was great  I would definitely go back again. The service was a little slow, due to the fact that it was PACKED...... Guy Fiere
Was right this place is right on the money......If only we could have real 
German beer instead of the American version of German bier.. I would say that coming from an Austrian and an American who has spent two tours of Germany this place is the go to place for Awesome German-Ausrian food."}
{"text":"Very good Traditional German cuisine with excellent service provided by our waitress Corrine."}
{"text":"This is my favorite German restaurant! It is mouth watering delicious and they have lots of very authentic food items.  Wonderful atmosphere too with live music on Friday's! I bring my little dog there all the time and they love her! They even wait on her too and bring her fresh water and a sausage!"}
{"text":"Where are the zero stars? I was raving about this place to my mom on the way to downtown Glendale because I have been here before...got seated pretty quickly, but our server (whose name I wouldn't even know because he never introduced himself) was less than friendly. When we ordered he let us know they may be out of one of our lunch choices, so he went to check and sure enough they didn't have it..so we ordered something else and he went back and put the order in. After about 10 minutes or so a lady(I'm assuming maybe the manager) came back to our table and let us know that they didn't have the other item we ordered either...are you kidding me?? I understand on the menu it says limited availability, but come on...how about your servers let your customers know ahead of time that certain menu items may not be ready yet, or better yet OUT!! The manager did offer another option but at that point we were upset and wanted to leave! We ended up taking our business over to the hop shop and it is amazing! Get your shit together haus murphys!!


Oh and from a former server and current restaurant manager, to whoever our awful server was...learn a thing or two about customer service, it goes a long way even if the food is out of stock!"}
{"text":"I am half first generation German, and have lived and spent time in Germany, so I was super excited to finally try Haus Murphy's. My coworker and I stopped in for lunch, and I give them 3/5 stars. 

I ordered the spicy bratwurst, and asked if it came with a roll. At first the waitress thought I wanted a hot dog bun, so I clarified that I was asking for a Broetchen--she had no clue what that meant. I simplified, and asked if they had a dinner roll they could give me. The rolls that they had available were really soft, not the crusty Broetchen I am used to having with a brat. I was disappointed, but the roll was still okay. 

The sauerkraut was spot on--juniper berries and all. I could have easily eaten twice as much had come with the meal. The potatoes were okay, but could have used more seasoning. The bratwurst was absolutely delicious, and paired really well with the spicy and flavorful mustard (I believe horseradish mustard) that was offered.

Service was quick, and my iced tea never ran dry. The waitress was polite and attentive, even during the lunch rush. 

The lunch menu didn't have a weisswurst on it, which is my favorite kind of sausage. I also wish their potato pancakes had been available! 

I'm going to check out the other German restaurants in Phoenix, but am not against visiting Haus Murphy's again."}
{"text":"this place is wonderful! I love it. the stuffed mushrooms are very good. They have a German band on the weekends. The pretzel is also very good, well I can go on and on with the good food. The German margarita you will have to try!"}
{"text":"If you go in remembering that good quality food takes time to make, you will enjoy the experience.  The cold beer was great.  Then came the music - loads of fun for my older Polish Momma.  The mushroom appetizer was beautifully presented and quite tasty.  My goulash was superb.  Sit back, relax and enjoy the atmosphere - I promise you the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME ! My dining companion and I ordered a sampler platter , and deserts, it was fantastic. I would recommend this establishment to anyone who wants authentic German cuisine. The service was excellent , and the place was filling up, and it was early afternoon on a Sunday, I hear they do a great Oktoberfest."}
{"text":"We have a german food obsession in the family. The pretzel app., hello carbs why are you so good? Potato pancakes, good. Father had veal schnitzel he approved, my mom had one of the pork ones and she felt the pretzel crust dried it out a bit too much, oh well. Excellent service and atmosphere,  we had the pleasure of sitting outside in the bier garten. There was even entertainment,  oompah-style. Fantastic. Oh, and we came here due to the kick of going to an eatery that's been featured on triple d."}
{"text":"The service was not the most prompt and we waited for quite some time for our drinks and food. That being said we came here the night of Glendale glitters so in fairness they were packed. It may have been a fluke. The beers were fantastic and the perfect temperature and the food was very good and extremely authentic. We definitely will go back, maybe during a less busy time."}
{"text":"I'd give no stars is possible, this place is terrible, I don't know what happened but the service, food, and atmosphere has gone in the toilet. The bathrooms are a filthy mess, the staff is incompetent, and there food is nowhere near GERMAN. Oh and what kind of German Resturant flys the Mexican flag? No American flag too be found, only Mexico and Cardinals flags, should of knew then what this place was about. I won't be back to this place..."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Glendale. Walking into Haus Murphys is like walking into another country. I've never been to Germany so I wouldn't know if its authentic or not but as a native I know its definitely not the normal AZ restaurant. The food is pretty good and unlike most dishes that I've had elsewhere. Some of its pretty tasty and some of its not so much my style. The standouts are the schnitzels, meat loaf, sausage, and brew. They serve beer in these huge mugs that are super tasty. There is also a couple of dressed up polka type guys who sing and play music throughout the night. My sister loves Haus Murphys and its always fun to go with her and try different things. If you are a fan of German food or German beer I'm pretty sure this is the best place you can go to in Arizona. I'd probably give the food a 3.5 but the ambiance and the killer brew and sheer size of the mugs deserve an overall 4."}
{"text":"Drove 30 minutes to get there and was excited to try a highly rated German restaurant which are hard to find.  First off, our server Nikki was fabulous.  Professional, friendly and aiming to please.  The sauerkraut puffs were a disappointment.  Mostly mashed potatoes fried.  No sauerkraut flavor.  The cream of chicken Florentine was delicious; properly seasoned and full of spinach, sun dried tomatoes and chunks of chicken.  My Wiener schnitzel was wonderful in texture, but lacked seasoning.  Needed a little garlic salt maybe.  The creamed wising on the side was blah and just luke warm.  The German potatoes looked like they'd just been reheated (maybe several times!).  My husband's sauerbraten was just ok.  His purple sauerkraut was excellent, but the spaetzle were tasteless doughy worms.  Was excited to try the apple strudel which is made on site.  Unfortunately, it was not fresh.  The pastry was mushy and apples overdone.  I think if they tweaked thing a bit more it would be a better experience."}
{"text":"How hilarious that two stars is \"Meh\" because that famous phrase of Larry David's was how I was going to begin this review.

The giant pretzel? So so, probably microwaved. The menu is fairly pedestrian- why is it so hard to find German food other than wursts, schnitzels, saurbraten, and the occasional rouladen? Oh yeah, the smoked pork chops too- the kassler whatever. There's so much more to German food.

First course was a soup not congruous with a German eatery. I don't remember exactly what it was, some cream soup that should have been called cream of milk.

My companion had a stew or goulash that was on offer that night. He liked it, but then again he's from St. Louis and thinks that Steak N Shake burgers are the shizzle.

I had a sampler platter, don't remember what side dishes came with it, I believe they were generous and fairly tasty- not sublime, but tasty, albeit mostly forgettable. (If you read my other reviews you will note that I tend to remember everything I ordered and the subtle nuances thereof)

I'd take a pass on Haus Murphy's, and that's sad, because they have a cute little biergarten and I like to support independent restaurateurs- a dying breed. 

Sigh."}
{"text":"I love Haus Murphy,  the Brie wrapped in puff pastry and served with berry sauce is delish. Always a pleasant dining experience.  The Jaeger was awesome!"}
{"text":"Went for my first time, I'm of German background. The food is first class authentic German fair! All the way from the establishment itself to the staff to the food. 1st class, can't say enough! I will be a regular from now on. I even inquired about a dish I have longed for that wasn't on the menu! Our server can back with a business card and said on my next visit call ahead, they would be happy to prepare it for me . Now that's service! Hope your thirsty as well! BIG BEERS!! ."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is A-OK in my book!  I've been here twice now and have had fun both times.  

The first time our group of four walked in the front entrance we thought we were in the wrong place.  There was no bar area in sight and who are we kidding, we were there to drink!.  The kind staff member let us know the bar area was down the long hallway, past the bathrooms.  Ah-ha, that is more what we were expecting.  There is also a nice patio area on the side that allows for direct access to the bar area.

Speaking of the bar, the boots of beer are a great picture opportunity.  I'm not sure who the model was for the boot, but that person had some very round calf muscles and very tiny ankles.  Also, when the beer in the boot gets low, drink with the toes to the side so that it doesn't bubble up in your face while you're drinking.

The appetizers are great to split with a big group.  The Sausage Sampler is one of my favorites for snacking; served with sauerkraut and mustard . . . YUM!  Other good choices include the stuffed mushrooms and soft pretzel.

Also, for you 24 fans, I think that Jack Bauer's older brother works behind the bar.  Nice guy!"}
{"text":"3 stars for food
4 stars for everything else

We wanted to try something new and so we decided to try this place.  First of all, I love the fact that they have plenty of free parking; even on a Sat night.  The restaurant is actually much larger than I thought with the huge back room where we were seated.  

Since it is a German restaurant, we were ready to try their beer but didn't have a clue as to which one...our waitress took delivery of bringing us samples to see which one we favor.  That was very nice of her.  After ordering the beer, we had the imported pretzel, Paprika Schnitzel, Sauerbraten.  

*Pretzel = YUM!  It was crusty on the outside and very chewy inside.
*Paprika Schnitzel = very much like Japanese cutlet.  Not as flavorful..
*Sauerbraten = we tried it because we heard that it takes 4 days.  Honestly, the only thing we could taste was the thick sauce, the meat was kinda tough, and the pasta was bland.  On the upside, I liked the red cabbage.

Overall, it was a great experience with live German music, great beer and pretzel.  
But would we go back?...probably not.

*Ambiance = Wonderful!  It doesn't really feel like AZ.
*Food = mediocre...we prefer more flavor
*Area = good.  in the middle of old town Glendale.
*Service = great.  we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us."}
{"text":"Really wanted to go to Haus Murphy's for quite awhile.. Attempted 3X this week.. Today was the day.  I'm The hostess was short, direct and to the point.. not very pleasant. The potato cake were outstanding , baked bri was also really good. The sausage sampler tasted old couldn't even get it down. Haus goulash tasted like Dinty Moore beef stew. The bathroom needed cleaning, the rug runner that in the dining area looked so dirty it needs to be replaced  at least a year overdue. The beer was awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, service not so much! Let me first say that we had a large group and one server  was definitely not enough but Patrick gave it a great effort. On the other hand we did call in a reservation so perhaps a bit more preparation on their part would have been helpful so all of us might  have been served and waited upon in a more timely manner. Also, I didn't know it went against protocol to turn around and ask the bar tender whom was not busy to refill a soda. I guess it was since I was told that was my server's job and he would get it, apprarently if he was I woudn't be asking the bar, enough said.
It was my first time at Haus Murphy and one of the best things about going with a big group is friends share. I ordered the Kilometer sausages, with fried potatoes and sauerkraut. The sausages were Hungarian, great flavor and so big they hung off the sides of the plate. I've never liked sauerkraut growing up but theirs I liked. My food was excellent and back to the friends and sharing, we exchanged bites, sausage for schnitzel, I tried a few, and every bite was amazing! I was getting quite full but since it's quite some distance from where I lived I figured I better try dessert. Oh bread pudding would have made the evening, but unfortunately for me but probably fortunately for my waistline they had just ran out. 
I'd go back again, the food is definitely worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"We tried this establishment for my late birthday celebration based on the reviews of previous Yelpers. What a find!!! This restaurant is located in the Glendale historical district. The parking can be a little tight; you can park at a few close parking lots - it's a short walk. 

They have an outdoor seating area that looks fairly European. The atmosphere indoors is full of German cultural decorations as well. They even host Polka music on the weekends!

The wait staff was awesome and extremely friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. They have a terrific menu! We had one of their pretzels with cheese as an appetizer - it was huge! It took up the entire plate! You could split one of their pretzels between 3 to 4 people easy.

They serve authentic German beer, wine and cocktails along with a fantastic desert menu for after dinner.

I will definitely return for some authentic German cuisine and beer the next time we visit the Glendale area! A solid 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious German-fare. Living in Glendale has its perks, Glendale Square is home of Haus Murphy. The food is delicious and the ambiance is fantastic. You never know when a live band playing the polka is in the house. Try the schnitzels. They are all great. My favorite is the Paprika Schnitzel. They have a lovely warm kraut that they serve with the meal. For an appetizer, the Brie en Croute is divine served with a fabulous Lingenberry sauce. Try convincing your wait staff to give you extra Lingenberry sauce. If you are in to German sausages, they are delicious but a little on the pricey side. Of course, the beers are fantastic and robust. I love their Oktoberfest. Warning, this restaurant does not offer free bread. If you order the bread basket, while delicious, it is a small portion, so if you are a bread lover, you might have to order more than one basket and pay for it, too. Sometimes, they serve a beef broth soup that is to die for. Don't let looks deceive you. It doesn't look like much, but the flavors are robust and well-layered."}
{"text":"One word, INCREDIBLE!!!! That describes everything i have tried at Haus Murphy's. If you want to experience complete bliss then try the gnocchi, theres is really fantastic. Its definitely the best i have ever had. Also, there sausage is great and (I cant believe im saying this because I am someone who used to hate it but) There sauerkraut is amazing. I couldn't stop eating it.
   The place has a very nice historic feel to it which adds to the experience. They have a nice outdoor seating area and some nights they have a band that plays out there. 
    Just try Haus Murphy's, I know you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed; they had some \"live\" entertainment that was too loud; place was hot, and was told, well, its an old building and it is August, so it gets warm; not a good answer; food was mediocre at best; I've had way better...and the prices were high for some items; 7.50 for potato pancakes? really? Went for a friends birthday, but won't go back again...."}
{"text":"My husband & I were excited to try this place, especially since my husband spent 4 yrs in Germany.  He always raved about how wonderful Jäger Schnitzel is.  

We decided to go on a Saturday, for lunch.  Because reservations are recommended, we called and asked if they had anything for around 1:30 (it was 12:00 when we called).  They said \"no problem.\"  When we arrived at about 1:10, we noticed there were only 3 tables with patrons.  They seated us right away.  First impression was that the entire restaurant needs a MAJOR redo and update on the decor!  The carpet was filthy, and as we passed all the varied & different  pictures (tons), I couldn't help but noticed how much dust lay on the frames.

The staff was attentive.  We were brought our drinks & water very quickly.  Although I had to have them take my water back because there was lettuce floating in the water.  

When my new water & glass (?) returned lettuce-free, we ordered.  My husband, as expected, ordered the Jäger Schnitzel.  I decided to try something I'd never had & ordered Beef Gulasch (roughly translated: Beef Goulash).  

Our food arrived in about 20 minutes.  First thing we noticed was how small the Schnitzel portion was.  Wasn't much bigger than my husbands palm. After my husband took his first bite, I could tell he wasn't impressed.  I tried it also.  The breading was not crispy & it tasted like unflavored panko bread crumbs.  The Wild Mushroom Demi that was on top was really salty.  As was the green cabage that came as one of the sides.

My Gulasch was served in a bowl, which was appropriate.  I was expecting  some vegetables or pasta in the bowl, not just meat and a couple mushrooms.  The gravy tasted like jarred brown gravy with a few sauteed mushrooms thrown in.  My husband suggested mixing the meat & gravy with the pasta that came on the side called Schwäbische Spätzle.  Sounded like a good idea since the noodles were extremely dry.  Once I mixed the two together, it still wasn't that good.

Our final impression?  Just barely ok!  The restaurant interior is old and weary looking.  The food portions were small.  The food taste was either very bland or too salty.  The temp of the food was lukewarm.  All in all, this restaurant was nothing special, and certainly nothing about the food or atmosphere would make us go back!"}
{"text":"First time visitor.  The four if us ordered four different things.  It was all wonderful.  The tomato soup at the beginning was so so for me but everyone else loved it.  The portions were huge but I wouldn't have wanted to share.  Will be going again."}
{"text":"El día 8 de diciembre del 2015, en mi negocio decidimos comprar algo diferente de lo común entonces fuimos a este gran restaurante a pedir algo diferente, y una gran sorpresa la comida que nos vendieron estuvo exquisita, con un gran trato, me sentí confortable, y sobre todo, la generosidad, humildad y de esta gran persona, ROSE HOFFMANN, UNA GRAN PERSONA, EXELENTE  SERVICIO....."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a German restaurant these days, so when we found this place on a recent vacation to Scottsdale, we were thrilled.

The food is terrific.  My husband had the goulash, and pronounced it excellent.  He is German, so that means more than from most people - he knows what it should taste like!

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the only healthy options (the two sandwiches with ham/pear or turkey/apple) were not available the day we were there.  This is not a place to try to find healthy eating options!

But the grilled Reuben was excellent, with a ton of meat.  Great fries, too!

Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Only visited for a nice cold German beer, but found the place to be very pleasant and relaxing. Selection was excellent. Pretzels were also very good. Very nice outdoor patio for nice weather. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere, plenty of shade and it wasn't too hot. I had the paprika schnitzel that was featured on the food network and my girlfriend had the smoked sausage and sourkrout. Also, I'm not a beer guy, but their German beer was pretty good! All in all I'd definitely recommend this place, even our waiter was German. My only complaint is they didn't have even a small selection of domestic beers."}
{"text":"Wasn't particularly looking for German food yesterday when I was in downtown Glendale. But we found this place and BAM!  What a treat!  

I had a turkey and apple sandwich which was a fantastic choice for a 110° afternoon in Arizona!  Light. Refreshing. And a surprising blast of flavors. 

We also had the classic Ruben. My guest said \"the best Ruben\" she's had \"since the last time\" she was \"in New York City\". So. That's something!

Both came with fries which were great, in my opinion. Excellent seasoning. 

I will be back to try some of their other authentic German dishes. 

Solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Took my parents here twice and my hubby and I keep going back. Mom is German and she loves how everything has tasted so far. We tried the chocolate cake that is made with sauerkraut juice and oh my gosh, I need the recipe! Not a big fan of chocolate but this was oh so darn scrumptious! Thank goodness there were 4 sharing it though. Lol. Gosh, the potatoes are so relish too. Well, really, what isn't good that I have eaten there yet! Hahahah 

The waitress' have been really nice and the cleanliness of the restaurant has been well maintained. Great location!

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner yesterday night. It was quite a quiet night...most shops were already closed on the street and it was only 7pm. The restaurant was nicely lit so it wasn't hard to find.

We tried the Bauernplatte - Combo for two. So basically it has a little bit of everything on the menu...pretty good choice if you want to try everything they serve in one sitting. hehe 

So the combo plate included three types of bratwurst, pork schnitzel (which is a flat piece of pork, breaded and fried), kassler kotelett ( which is porkchop), German fried potatoes, German potato salad, red cabbage and sauerkraut. I liked all three types of bratwurst, but the most tasty of them all is the kassler kotelett. This pork chop is very different from any kind of pork chop I have had...usually pork chops are pretty rough and not very flavorful...but this pork chop is very moist and flavorful...sorta taste like ham. This was my bf and my favorite out of the sampler. The pork schnitzel wasn't that good because there was no sauce and it was a bit bland. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad because it was sour...not a fan of the red cabbage or the sauerkraut but the German fried potatoes were tasty. 

The beer according to my bf has a different taste and is slightly stronger than American beer. 

The service was really good - - the waitress was very friendly and sweet.

Overall, I liked the food, atmosphere and service. =]"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 
I am by no means a German Food critic - nor do I know what German food is \"supposed\" to taste like, but hopefully this is it, because it's amazing.  My husband was stationed in Germany for 6 Years, and he loves it... so I trust his opinion. 

I love the beer, I love the spatzel, I LOVE the snitzel. 

I bring everyone to Haus Murphy I can, because everything is amazing. 
A few times, I brought my parents and there was a polka bang being amazing in the bar area. 

I love this resturant."}
{"text":"My glutOny and my lack of knowledge abOut the american measure system will kill me!
But at least i'm trying the gOod and special plates anywhere.
I wanted to grab a beer on a terrasse to review aome touristic information abOut Glendale, and i finished with a 32 oz grape fruit beer and a giant bretzel!

Both of it succulent.
The grapefruit beer was really perfumed and fresh while the bretZel was perfectly baked and sized for me.

It seems that the place hosted Oktoberfest and i believe it did it perfectly!

Just where is the austrian blonde in her folkloric dress!!!???"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because my boyfriends family loves eating here. I thought it was just okay.

The heavily decorated interior was a bit much for my taste and the loud music made it hard to talk to one another. Our table and menus had that \"sticky diner feel\". 

We ordered the giant pretzel with cheese sauce and that was the best part of the meal by far. For dinner I ordered the weiner schnitzel and it was bland and overly greasy. It came with a side of fried German potatoes that were also coated in grease and flavorless. However I will give credit to their sausage. My boyfriend ordered the kilometer and that was phenomenal. I regret not getting the chocolate cake everyone raves about because it looked incredible.  

The staff was great and id give them 5 stars for customer service. Id come back to try more of their sausage options just to give it another chance. Maybe German food just isn't for me."}
{"text":"It was so good! My family and I made reservation for 7:15 on a Saturday night. We arrived a few minutes early but we were seated right away. We ordered a couple of the liter beers and an appetizer to start, the stuffed mushrooms which were on point! Especially with the cream sauce( ask for extra) my Fiancé and I ordered the Jagersnitzschel plus added spatzle, potato dumpling, and sauerkraut. Make sure to get extra sauce for everything. Everything was delicious except for the spatzle which could have used a thicker gravy sauce as well as the potato dumpling. I was stationed in Germany awhile back so I think I might know a thing or two... Everything was pretty authentic but I think they need to make the gravy thicker and with a little more flavor. Other than that it was delicious and we will be back to try other things. The Sauer kraut was some of the best we have ever had. Our server was very nice and attentive her name was Angela. The ambiance was great too, we really liked the live music."}
{"text":"Greatest German Food in Arizona.

I feel a little jet lagged, I've just come from Germany, but no jet lag here, I was eating at Haus Murphy in Downtown Glendale and thought I was in Germany. 

Great place, don't miss eating here, or you will miss a real treat."}
{"text":"Quick service, excellent food. Thanks for reminding me on Facebook that we needed schnitzel. It was great."}
{"text":"Personally, I felt like the food was not that great. My chicken was dry and the sauce was too cheesy. So if you're into cheesy stuff then I guess you'll like the mushroom sauce over the chicken. The potatoes was honestly very soggy and gross. As for the sauerkraut, it was so nasty. The taste didn't even taste like sauerkraut... I don't know what it was honestly.. I'm disappointed with the food here. 

The service was not that great either. Our waitress was very straight forward. I asked for more crackers and she literally threw it on the table without saying anything. She was very slow and not that attentive. 

I would come back again but I probably get something different to try.... Maybe their pretzel cause it looked really good."}
{"text":"Not a fan anymore! 3 stars for the fantastic Pretzels. Took my husband for his Birthday per his request. We have celebrate multiple birthdays here. It was dead quiet and the waitress refused to sing Happy Birthday in German. Time to find another place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever for October Fest. Asked server 3 times for our drink and waited an hour. Finally had to go to bar to get beer. Food took forever & came out all wrong. Their excuses we are really busy tonight and our kitchen has a default for your food. WHAT????"}
{"text":"Went for Oktoberfest and had a great time!  We had to go to the bar to get our mixed drinks since they would not bring them to the table, only beer.. but that was our only complaint.  The waitress was always on spot with help and food even with such a heavy load with all the people there and we had a table of 16."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy has really gone down hill...it used to be amazing...now sadly it is average."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant on a Friday night around 7pm without reservations, and were seated right away.  The inside was packed because of the heat outside.  There is an inside and outside area to dine.  We decided to eat indoors.  We ordered the sausage Sampler at $10, and were surprised at the size of the sampler, nice size.  There was around 3 or 4 sausages on a huge bed of sauerkraut. Since we ordered the sausages for an app. I decided to try the Goulash Meal with Spaetzle, and Sauerkraut at $14.  My husband tried a combo with some sort of pork, with German potatoes and another helping of sauerkraut at $16.  My dish was a good size and the Goulash was really good, lots of gravy.   My husband's pork was nice and tender, almost melted in his mouth.  It took awhile for us to get our meal, we ordered a couple of beers while waiting.  During our dinner live polka musicians were playing.  It was nice to get some German ambiance in phoenix.  Beers were warm, but that's what was expected. For two of us to eat, with app, and two beers our dinner was about $75 with tip.  It was also hot in the restaurant.  They have plastic over the seats and it was a warm night and we sat right by the windows, so it was a little uncomfortable.   Both my husband and I were sweating, so we didn't want to sit around after our meal.  The food was good though."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Waited 30 minutes for for our beers.  Then waited another 30 morning mutes to take our order then 20 minutes later was told they were out of chicken.   When delivered the server got snotty with us when HE placed the wrong plates down.  

No apology.  No compensation.  .zero service recovery."}
{"text":"Really a pretty good place to have some good German Food. Good beer selection and fun atmosphere. Love their schnitzel and potatoes! Only reason this isn't a 5 Star - is the service is a bit uneven and the cake (black Forrest cherry) goes from awesome to styrofoam - you never know if it's gonna be great one time and completely dried out the next. Still fun and pretty yummy."}
{"text":"My husband has wanted to go here for ages. 


The server was so, so sweet. 
The accordion player added atmosphere 
The raspberry center of the torte was yummy
The gravy on the pork tenderloin schnitzel was excellent 
The pork tenderloin schnitzel was excellent, not heavy or greasy

The beef roulade was okay 

The lemon raspberry torte was heavy, lacked a lemon taste.  What I ate was the raspberry Center which was only on the bottom layer. This should have been on both layers.  The cream was a bit overwhelming

The tap water that was served had an extremely hard water taste. There was no other water available to purchase."}
{"text":"I was mistaken in my previous review. This place is honestly delicious. Maybe the kitchen was just having an off night the first time I went? Who knows, but if you order the steak schnitzel you can't go wrong. The wait staff is very friendly but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be mirrored by the management."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for almost 2 years now but I don't get to the west valley too much.  Today we celebrated a friend's graduation and he wanted to come here.  What an awesome place.  Very nice and spacious with a beer garden outside with a stage and the inside feels very homey.  We came on a Thursday around 2:30 and we got seated immediately.  We started out with their Original Oktoberfest Pretzel to share.  Man was that good.  Served with a side of cheese and their house made spicy mustard.  I could eat 3 of those they were that good.

For lunch I tried the Schweizer Schnitzel.  It's a pork tenderloin fried golden brown with black forest ham and swiss cheese on top.  It is served with a side of German potatoes  and Wirsing.  I've never had Wirsing.  It was cooked cabbage with bacon and herb cream cheese.  I'm not a fan of cooked cabbage and let me say I could eat a plate of Wirsing.  The whole meal was fabulous and our waitress was excellent.  I saw this restaurant featured on Triple D and I knew I had to try it.  I will be back to Haus Murphy's.  It's a long drive from where I live but worth it.  A great place to have authentic German food done right and with a great atmosphere to boot."}
{"text":"Before my last visit, I would have given this place a positive review, but after my last visit, I will never be returning. We were sitting there for an hour while people who came in long after we did were getting their food. The manager came out and told us that they had lost our order. We received a lukewarm apology at best, and all we got for our troubles was a free bread basket. No comps, no discount, nothing. Congratulations, Haus Murphy. You have successfully guaranteed that a lover of German food will NEVER return! Goodbye, and good riddance!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned authentic German restaurant. I love the biers available on tap and their schnitzels."}
{"text":"Good food, but overpriced. I've been to Germany on numerous occasions, and when i told my German friends how much the bill came to ($98 for 2 people), the reply was that someone from the restaurant should have came home with us to do some housework. 

I'd go back for the beer, but I'd eat somewhere else 1st."}
{"text":"I've been to Haus Murphy's twice now (once for my birthday, once for the World Cup finals), and both times were incredible! I have a lot of Germany heritage, and grew up in a VERY German area of Pennsylvania. When I got to Phoenix I searched high and low for German restaurants and this is the only authentic one I could find, and it does not disappoint.

The Service:
Service has been great both times. Staff is very courteous, and the first time we went our waiter gave us the full history of the restaurant and explanation of German food, traditions, etc. He grew up in Germany and had awesome stories to tell.

The Food:
I admittedly ordered the same thing both times I went: Weinerschnitzel. It was too good not to order again! The schnitzel itself is always lightly breaded and fried, just like it should be. It comes with German fried potatoes and Wirsing (a chopped, creamy savoy cabbage side dish that is nearly impossible to find in most restaurants). Both are delicious. Also the portions of everything are huge!
My guests ordered the \"Schweizer Schnitzel,\" \"Huhner Scnitzel,\" \"The BIG Smokey Beef Brat,\" \"Nurnberger Bratwurstchen,\" and \"Rote Bratwurst.\" All the brats were very tasty, and most come with homemade sauerkraut (by far the best sauerkraut I've ever had -- my wife who usually refuses to eat it enjoyed theirs).
As far as appetizers go you also can't go wrong with the Potato Pancakes or Oktoberfest Pretzel (HUGE - big enough for 3 or 4 people).

Price:
Haus Murphy's is on the pricier side ($19.95 for the Weinerschnitzel), but that's really pretty typical for good Weinerschnitzel, and the portions are so large that you can make it into two meals. All the brat meals were $10-$11 and they have a good variety of sandwiches that are around $8-$10 which is good if you're on a tighter budget.

The Decor: 
Very unique and eclectic German decor. Lots of interesting \"knick-knacks,\" paintings, etc. Many of the waitresses dress in Lederhosen which adds a nice touch.

Wunderbar:
Haus Murphy's has a bar/lounge in the back called Wunderbar. We came here to watch the Germany v. Argentina World Cup finals and it was an awesome experience. Tons of screaming German fans all packed into a room lined with German flags and beer steins. It felt like we were in another country. They also have a ton of German beers on tap (including Stofferhoffer -- one of my all time favorites).

Overall, great food, great atmosphere, I HIGHLY recommend it! Excited to come back when they have live music and polka!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and went out with wife and parents for a pre Valentines day get together.  I was not disappointed.  The food is wonderful and very authentic.  The atmosphere is amazing and the place is filled to the brim, make a reservation.  I love this place and would recommend it to anyone.

FYI Haus Murphy's is generally packed so a reservation is helpful but not necessary.  Also it is not as cheap as a trip to Chili's, so be prepared to spend $35 and up if you want the full experience, obviously more if you are going to have drinks.

My recommendation is to try something new off the appetizer menu when you go!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were out for a girl's afternoon out and wanted to try something different for lunch.  We decided on Haus Murphy's.  Being a fan of DDD, we thought we were in for a real treat--so wrong.  The cheese spread appetizer was good and that's where it ended.  We ordered the combo plate for two.  First of all, the food was warm at best;  bad sign.  The portions on the platter were rather skimpy not to mention tasteless.  Guy, we think you got this one wrong!"}
{"text":"Poor at best. Slow service. The sides were dry and flavorless--even the sauerkraut. The only reason the place is still in business is that it is the only German restaurant on the west side of the valley."}
{"text":"Very fun, lively, authentic German restaurant.  Our waiter, Johann, really made us feel like he just got in from Germany.  He was probably from Iowa or something silly but he did a great job of making us comfortable and being in the moment.  Everyone loved their selections, espeically my wiener schnitzel w/spaetzle.  And the ice cold German beer selections were great."}
{"text":"We went a long way to try this restaurant and was disappointed, it was not great for sure we tried the platter for two with everything on it!!!  We went to Helga's in Aurora Colorado so many times I lost count, it was wonderful, always fresh made but here it tasted like we were eating leftovers warmed up out of the fridge!! The waiter and service was great only wish the food was!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Went to see the Christmas lights in downtown Glendale. Heated patio, large beer hall / sports bar atmosphere, authentic German food. Party of four, early dinner at 5pm. Filled up fast. Good service. Recommend the pork schnitzel, kraut and potato meal. Winter menu is edited down. A fun experience, walk off the beer looking at the lights and maybe visit the Cerreta candy a few blocks down."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and decided to go again last night.  I've always found it odd that there are so few German spots in the Phoenix area (much less good ones).  It would seem odd that Downtown Glendale of all places would lay claim to the best German spot in the Phoenix area, but having sampled many of the few others in town that exist, its hard to deny that Haus Murphy's has the goods.  Whether you're here for sausages and schnitzels, a good German beer, the feel of a nice outdoor biergarten, or the weekend polka music, you really can't go wrong here.  Just be warned that no matter what you order, the portions will be enormous.  And you'll be hard pressed to find any dishes that have vegetables.  And you'll be even harder pressed to find dishes that don't have meat and potatoes.  Fortunately I'm a meat and potatoes guy and highly recommend each and every one of their sausage dishes.  

My only complaint in the times I've been here is that the service can be a little slow.  On Friday and Saturday nights when the place is packed and the polka band is playing that can be expected, but even when I've come on random lunch and early dinner hours when the place is slower, the service is still pretty slow.  So be sure to plan on spending some time here (I'm pretty sure that's their goal anyway).  As long as you're not in a big hurry and have a hearty appetite, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. We had a group of 32 and were seated immediately the food was delicious and the service was fantastic. We had the roulanden which was amazing."}
{"text":"I had a really good time, but sometimes I think your experience at a restaurant is much better due to the company.  I really enjoyed our gigantic table.  It created a little bit of havoc for the server and it made service a little slow, but I will cut them some slack.  I ordered the pretzel, because I am a carb addict.  I was so happy we had such a big group, because after cutting a piece I could pass it around to share and not feel so guilty.  It was big enough that about 10 people were able to taste it.  I really liked it.  The spicy mustard was indeed spicy. Before our dinners we got split pea soup, it was very tasty, I am usually not a soup person, but I was hungry and I enjoyed it very much.  For my entree I ordered the Wiener Schitzel, I had not had baby cow in a long time, it was well worth it.  I ate only have of it and took home the rest.  It came with potatoes and wirsing.   The potatoes were very good, on the other hand, I personally didn't like the wirsing (a creamy cabbage concoction).  Good thing Amy liked it, lol. We ordered dessert, but they were taking so long that we asked to have our Black Forest cake and Cherry Strudel to go.  When I got home, I was trying to be so good and got only a third of the strudel, then gave my hubby a third and put the rest in the fridge.  Well that freaking strudel was amazing, I went back to the fridge and ate the rest.  The next day I went twice to the gym."}
{"text":"Great meal i had the chicken schnitzel and the best apple strudel ever. Good atmosphere great service."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun band playing on the patio - love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Huge portions and great service. Must try the sauerkraut potato puffs - even if you're hesitant... they're amazing! I've had schnitzels and sausage and many different appetizers and I haven't been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wife wanted to celebrate the completion of a long term goal and a local friend suggested this place.  However, due to the cold snap we decided upon pho but couldn't locate the place and realized we were right across the corner from Haus Murpheys and decided to pay it a visit instead.

I will start with a disclaimer stating that I have no idea what good german food is or should taste like.

Really loved our dining experience here.  Deduct one star for the slow service.  But in our servers defense, she was helping out in two separate rooms and seemed a little over taxed.
We started with the stuffed mushrooms and was delighted with the taste of the spicy sausage that came through.  Good enough that I could have just eaten a few plates of these for the entire meal.
For the main course we split the Bauernplatte platter which ended up being more than we could handle.  So lets talk meat.  The brauts were great, rote being the better of the two imo, since the german one seemed a bit lacking in flavor.  The Hackbraten, aka meatloaf, was really good and pared well with the spicy mustard.  Next up was the Kassler, which was basically a thick ass ham steak.  It's pork, so, Awesome!  The final slab of meat was the schnitzel which I was surprised with how much I liked it.  Reason was that it was quite rare, which I wasn't sure if it should be or not but it made the texture very delicate and almost melted.
For the non-meat items, the german potatoes were the best.  If only breakfast places could serve potatoes like this!  The regular sauerkraut had good flavor but was too soft for my taste.  The red sauerkraut didn't appeal to me at all.  Least liked was the spatzle.  I just don't get it.  Just little noodles of blah.   
As if this wasn't enough to bring about a food coma, we followed it up with the sauerkraut cake since this is what our friend insisted we should try if we visit.  Chocolate nirvana.  I can only handle small amounts of rich chocolate so only had a few bites but it was seriously good stuff.
Oh, and the beer.  Not much of a german beer fan since I'm into IPAs but the big ass stein of Octoberfest was pretty decent.
Overall, a very enjoyable night out and one I'd certainly be willing to repeat again if we are in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"We have been here many times over the years and the food is consistently good. Last night we took an out of town visitor there for dinner to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather by sitting outside and have a few beers. They had their Oktoberfest menu which is about 8 entree options from their regular menu and 2 appetizer options. They didn't budge from this because when I asked for a side of spätzle I was shot down. Despite it not being packed they were also serving dinner on plastic plates because of the crowds we were told. We walked in at 6:45 on 
A Saturday night and were seated immediately so that argument didn't really hold up with me but I didn't let it bother me.

I had the chicken schnitzel which was delicious! My husband had the paprika schnitzel and our guest the German bratwurst. A couple rounds of Spaten put a smile on everyone's face. We should have ordered the pretzel appetizer but we were smart and passed because there was no way we could have eaten that and managed to finish the huge portions they serve for the entrees.

The restaurant itself inside could use some freshening up but if you go when the weather is nice you can sit outside and not worry about it."}
{"text":"After viewing this on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives, we have been wanting to go there ever since, but we live on the other side of town.  So when we had an opportunity to go there, I was thrilled.  We ordered the Reuben and Potato Pancakes to share.  The corned beef so so mouthwatering, I could have just eaten that alone; however, the bread needed to be toasted a little more because it fell apart easily.  I didn't care because it was really tasty.  The potato pancakes were a little larger than my gram used to make, and they were made with onions, but I enjoyed them.  The plate was larger than I expected for an appetizer (not complaining at all), but hated to waste any.  It was served with applesauce and sour cream.  I wish I could have enjoyed the beers there, as they looked good.  I would go back.  Service was fine, no complaints."}
{"text":"My family and I are very large fans of German food. And have been to Germany. So when Haus Murphy's popped up on Yelp I knew we had to try it. On our visit we had the Haux (Braised Pork Shank), Sausage Platters, Large Pretzel, and of course lots and lots of Hefeweizen! Overall I thought that Haus Murphys was pretty decent. The Haux was flavorful although I would have liked it a bit warmer. The sausage was flavorful as well. Overall I would go back to Haus Murphys for sure if in the Glendale AZ area."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have dine here several times.  We always have great service and a great tasting meal.  The portions are huge.  I like the pork shank, it doesn't even fit on the plate, really tasty. Hubby loves the different type of links. great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I and our two son have for years gone to Haus Murphy for Christmas Eve dinner.  We all have lived in Germany for an extended time and a German dinner for our family and our son's wive and girlfriend so a Christmas eve German dinner has become a tradition.  The year before last the woman who runs the place didn't treat us very well (a party of 6).  We tried again last year and they treated us even more shamefully.  We all decided that our experience with Haus Murphy has come to an end.  It's a shame but each time, the woman has pushed us impatiently to finish and we'd made reservations for 7:00 but none the less the lady did everything but put our order in a box and shove us out the door.  Even something as simple as bread with dinner was with held.
Perhaps any other time of the year but not on Christmas eve.  If they don't want customers on the 24th, they should just close for the day."}
{"text":"The sausage/bratwurst at Haus Murphy's is great.  Very flavorful, but I am more fond of the Krakaur (sp?) brat than the others. 

The sausage appetizer is definitely great for a big group and comes with a mustard that is excellent.

Our german waiter was a nice touch. :)

We sat in the lounge area which is nicely decorated and the bar looks great.  The tables being put together is pretty cool, although I kind of wished they were the same type/size so that you didn't feel like the puzzle pieces didn't match.  But that may be my OCD talking.

The food did take a while to cook.  I didn't get a chance to try the schnitzel, but one day I will.  Meanwhile I had the German Brat, which was moist and flavorful.  It was on top of the saurkraut... which having been a child who hated saurkraut, I tried it yesterday for the first time since, and I liked it.  So kudos to them for changing my view of saurkraut.  Unfortunately, my diet currently limits any starches, so I was unable to try the potatos that came with it, but they sure smelled good and looked seasoned appropriately.

The german beer was AWESOME coming in these HUGE mugs... all I needed was one beer.

Price wasn't too bad either.  $34 for a German Brat plate, Krakaur (sp?) brat plate, a side salad, and two german beers.

We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great environment but absolutely atrocious service and ok stuffed mushrooms appetizer. We waited for 30 for a table and ordered right when we seat down. After an hour the only thing we received was our appetizer. 5 mins after we seat the table next to us seat and received AND finished food within the hour waiting time for us.  The waitress stated they got their food first bcz they didn't ordered any appetizer. I must be wearing my \"I'm stupid\" sign. Thanks for ruining date night."}
{"text":"didnt think the food was all that great despite what everyone has been telling me.

go the chicken schniztel and it came out looking like fried country steak with a thick cream mushroom sauce.  the only thing i liked was the potato salad which was not made from mayo but from vinegar and bacon.  

music was loud and lively...dont think ill go back but can see how it can be a good hangout place downing a couple of beers..."}
{"text":"Still a fan!  I love their potatoes.  We tried the platter for 2 - 3 different sausages, fried pork chop and pork shank, red cabbage and sauerkraut.  Also some noodley things I didn't really care for..  Everything else though is awesome!"}
{"text":"Some good German brews on tap, though known for some tasty wines and fun cocktails they mix.

They have great sausages, decent German style food, not overly extravagant, though table service was excellent. Price was as I'd expect it to be. Wifey and I got the dinner for 2 for $35, I kicked back two Dunkel's and she had a delicious white wine. For desert we opted for the cake and coffees. 

You can opt to sit at the bar, a table, or outside depending on weather and events going on (or lack thereof). 

Clean bathrooms. Plentiful parking around the back sides of the building. It has a homey kind of atmosphere, you are among friends and relax, kudos there.

All in all a nice treat - I'd surely return and explore more of their menu and drinks! As for the authenticity of it being German, well that's like trying to describe American food, you will get something different depending on what region you are in -- it was German enough for me ;)"}
{"text":"Great service and fun atmosphere.  If you like German Cuisine, this is a fun place to be with authentic food.  The giant pretzel is a hit with the kiddo's"}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  Great food, excellent beer, and live polka!  Be sure to get the sausage and pretzel appetizers."}
{"text":"I've heard so many awesome things about this place & we finally decided to go try it out.  We were seated right away & our server was as sweet as could be! I've never had German food so I went over some Yelp pics while waiting to get an idea of what I wanted.  I ordered the Hühner (chicken) Schnitzel that came with a white wine sauce, I ordered it with the mushroom sauce instead.  My mom got the Jager (pork) Schnitzel.  I also ordered french fries on the side because I had been craving fries alllll day.  Our food took a bit to come out but it was okay, it gave us time to admire all of the cute decor.  My schnitzel was just on the warm side when it came out & wasn't crispy which I was expecting it to be. It was just more of a soft piece of chicken with soft breading.  It came with the white wine sauce even though I asked for a different one, our server apologized & brought me a side of the mushroom sauce.  It was already too late since my chicken came with the sauce all over it to begin with.  Oh well.  The flavor was pretty good, I was just really looking forward to the chicken being crispy.  Is schnitzel supposed to be crispy? I'm not sure, but I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"One of favorite German restaurants!  We make a special trip out there and always go during Glendale glitters."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim to try a beer and check out this place and was very pleasantly surprised.  Good beers and wine, lovely atmosphere on the patio, and the paprika schnitzel was very tasty! Icing on the cake was listening to the entertaining accordion/ tuba while eating! The only reason I didn't give them a five as we didn't go inside and have a full dinner but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here today for lunch! I got the Oktoberfest Pretzel with cheese and the Reuben with fries. The food and beer were wonderful! I also brought my dog and the staff more than welcomed him. They gave him a bowl of water and a bowl of house made sausage snacks for him! He loved them!! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I go here on my Anniversary. Amazing food, and believe it or not, a great bar too. The bill is about 25$ per person so fancy but not SOO out of the budget. Thanks Haus Murphy!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, can't wait to go back! I grew up on German food and was hesitant that it wouldn't compare to my Oma's cooking, but I wasn't disappointed. Our waitress, Carlene, was so nice and very knowledgeable about the menu! We definitely be back with the whole family."}
{"text":"I know it is difficult to be a vegetarian or a pescatarian at certain restaurants. Haus Murghy's is one of them.

They do have some vegetarian options, but almost all of them were carb-heavy. (I need my protein too!!) Their giant Bavarian pretzel was, er, giant. It was warm and delicious with mustard. Although I am a huge fan of spätzle, the vegetarian version of Farmer Skillet (basically buttered noodles with some veggies) was rather bland compared to the gnocchi smothered in rich Gruyere cheese and wild mushroom sauce.

My dining companions ordered a wedge salad (a wedge of Iceberg lettuce = B-O-R-I-N-G), Caesar salad with grilled chicken (pretty good, so I was told), and bean soup (with hamburger meat).

The service was friendly, but I just wish they had given a bit more thought to fish/veggie options. (Or am I being ridiculous?)"}
{"text":"If this is what all German food tastes like, then consider me a fan.

I was in Phoenix to celebrate my birthday with family, and we sort of found our way here by accident.  The decor is very charming -- as though a group of German grandmothers decided to put up every picture frame and knick knack they had -- and the service is prompt and very pleasant.  

For starters, we the pastry-wrapped brie with lingonberry jelly -- a HUGE hit with the family.  The pastry crust was crisp, the brie melty and gooey, and the lingonberry jelly served as the perfect sweet complement to the cheesey, savory flavors.  Even my sister, whom I consider a pretty picky eater, loved it.

For the main course, it was schnitzel all around!  My mom ordered the Schweizer Schnitzel (pork wrapped in Emmentaler cheese and ham), which she really liked, but wished she had ordered a sauce to come with it.  My sister had the Paprika Schnitzel, which was actually a lot sweeter than she had expected, but again, very tasty.  I had the Holstein Schnitzel (fried egg, anchovies, and capers), which was everything I had hoped it would be.  Dad changed things up by ordering the Beef Roulades, which he simply could not stop eating.  I don't even remember him talking while food was on his plate, to be honest.  

I ordered a litre of the Hefeweizen they had on tap in hopes that I'd get the infamous glass boot, but unfortunately they were saving all the boots for the upcoming Oktoberfest, and so I just got a huge regular-shaped glass instead.  I'm not really a big beer drinkers, and so without the novelty of the boot glass, downing that much beer wasn't as much fun as I'd wanted (especially since I was the only one drinking), but I don't fault them for that policy.  I'll just have to go back some other time!  

All in all, a very good, fulfilling meal.  A very cute restaurant nestled in a charming area of old Glendale, Haus Murphys is a refreshing escape."}
{"text":"The patio is very nice. Live music is fun. Been coming for years. Food is good. But everything is incredibly over priced. From the beer to the German bratwurst."}
{"text":"Great German place in downtown Glendale!  The atmosphere was really nice...not sure why they seated us in the bar when everyone else was seated in the front dining room though.  Our server was very helpful in making beer and dinner recommendations.  The food was pretty good too...I had the special kraut rouladen with potatoes and red cabbage.  The beer garden looked like a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon in cooler months and I hear they have a band that plays every Friday and Saturday night which would be fun!"}
{"text":"Saturday night is a fun night to go to HausMurphy in downtown Glendale. Get there early before they sellout of the smoked pork chops! 
There was a tuba and accordion player that serenaded us throughout our dinner time. 
Not a lot of gluten-free on the menus unless you count the sausages. Oh and their chicken dumplings soup.
Great portions and tasty German food and bier.;)"}
{"text":"I didn't know German food was so delicious!  
The menu is fairly big and thankfully pretty descriptive.  Our party of 6 adults and 1 child all had different things and all very much enjoyed our meals.  I think there is enough variety on the menu for everyone to find something to enjoy.  I was honestly pretty intimidated, figured it would all just be big greasy sausages and sauerkraut.  I was delightfully surprised.  I would recommend the schitzel to those who are just ready to dip their toes in, it's basically just a breaded and fried piece of meat (chicken, pork, beef, whichever).  
Lots of beer and wine pics and a great atmosphere, particularly outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is fabulous in so many ways that I can really only hit the highlights here. Even if German food isn't your favorite (I dislike saurkraut and cabbage), the service and food is great.

The service was wonderful. I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends, so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer (with my own mobile hotspot. . . Haus Murphy's does not have wi-fi). The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work.

My friends showed up, we had great dinners, and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters. If I'm able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January, I will certainly stop in Haus Murphy's. 

Authentic German or not (I've never been to Germany, my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too), this place is worth the visit. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good sauerkraut, and beef bratwurst. The sauerkraut chocolate cake was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Before I give this review I will say I grew up by a very old town Amish German town in the Midwest. 
 I love German food and in Arizona you can count on one hand that you get it here in the valley. I used to go to this place in the early 2000's and it used to be a once a month treat for us poor Airman stationed at Luke. We sat at the bar and service was excellent. I ordered the Sauerbraten and my wife order the Jagerschnitzel. The schnitzel was nicely prepared and gravy was excellent. The Sauerbraten did not seem to have been marinated, or if it was it wasn't marinated for very long. It was very dry and overcooked but the gravy was spot on! The Spätzle was also good just a little under seasoned. Great beer on tap and great ambiance. I don't mind paying for food when it's great, I was just hoping that their featured menu item had a little more quality control."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer.  We have always sat in the Wunderbar area, which is fine but I can't wait to chill on that great patio sometime."}
{"text":"German food, opens about 4 pm. German beer cold ones! Watch their specials sometimes not what you expected. Nice for an new adventure in dining. German decor. Ask the very helpful waiters. Nice restaurant. Be sure not to park in wrong places.you will get ticket.Price higher end . Nice friendly waiters that help you decide. A few American food items.Out door dining in Night evenings.More up scale Two people $50.00 for two to eat w desert too!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed.... Very pricey and not good=/ Maybe I just don't have the taste for German food."}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat at Haus Murphy's for years! Finally I was able to check this place out on my last visit to AZ. Although it was featured on Food Network, I was a little disappointed. Come prepared with Tums to naw on after you eat too. I left with the most wicked case of heart burn! I was expecting a more authentic feel to the enviornment and it was lacking. The food was ok, I had the pretzel crusted schnitzel, mashed potatoes, red cabbage and spaetzle. It was a little bland and had a lot of grease! I have had better German food with better ambience and the service was a little to be desired. I am glad I finally went, but I will look elsewhere for German food in the future."}
{"text":"It is as name suggests a German themed bar with all cliches thrown at it including traditional  music in the  evenings and all but it all gels well. It has indoor dining areas as well as patio seating. You can also chose to sit at the bar. The restaurant itself is located in Glendale downtown with plenty of free parking.They have a very nice selection of German beers on tap and they have a great range from blondes to.darks. The staff is friendly and courteous but not overbearing. I had a sausage plate which came with two sausages on a bed of sauerkraut with ketchup and two types of mustard. It was a pretty good meal for dinner. My friend got meatloaf with German take on it but it was just a regular meatloaf (where I took a star away). But overall they have great food and good beer. It is a nice place to spend an evening with family and friends. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Let's just say, this is personally my Favorite Restaurant.
Love sharing Haus Murphys with my family & my very close friends.
I might be a little bias, My Mom...Rose, & Chef Brett Hoffmann have created a Landmark of sorts for Glendale Az.  
They're the owners & creators of this little gem of a Restaurant.
I urge everyone to take in what they have both worked at for well over 20 years.  
Take your time & enjoy...Eat, Drink, & make some memories.  

Tell Mom I said, Hi...& that I couldn't be more proud of her,  & I love her."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. I had never tried German food, nor a bratwurst before my first visit here! Sit outside! The ambiance is perfect, (and unless it's in the middle of summer), the weather is perfect too. I can't ever decide so I usually convince someone to split the two-person sampler with me ($36.50). Which honestly can be split with more than two, depending on your appetite. The employees are dressed in authentic style German clothing. We even had a German server, Michael, who was with great spirits with us even though we stayed 10 minutes after close! If you're on the fence about the pretzel, you must get it (with cheese of course)"}
{"text":"The food is basically the same as always, decent but I lived in Germany for 8 yrs and its ok. Spaetzel was bland, no seasoning. I ordered stuffed mushrooms caps, plural, but got a giant portabello stuffed mushroom cap. Server did not advise me on this, and I sent it back. We ask for butter for the bread baske, and got frozen butter, really? The service is sorely lacking servers have no enthusiasm for their job and it carries over to your dining experience. I have been going to Haus Murphy's since 99 off and on I don't think I'll be coming back after our last visit."}
{"text":"After living in Germany for a decade I learned what good German food is. This place does a very good job of recreating a local restaurant in any German neighborhood. The decor is spot on and the waitresses dress were authentic. The beer selection is good,  unfortunately they were out of Pilsner. I enjoyed a very good Hefeweisse. My Jager Schnitzel was very good and high marks for the mushroom gravy. The potatoes were greasy and the cooked cabbage was mushy but tasty.  My cousin had the porkchops which were perfectly done. Her sides were edible but not fantastic. 
They do a great job on the main dishes but the sides were only ok and need improvement. 
Service was excellent. 
I would recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best German food in town we have been to Haus Murphys several times over the last fire years. We even celebrated Christmas here a while back the portions are great. My friend had the Steak Schnitzel I tried a bite and I would almost call it life changing. We also got to enjoy live accordion music in the Biergarten. I had the sampler for one and we split the huge Bavarian pretzel. It was all so good I decided to take a walk around downtown before getting back in the car to go all the way to the other side of town. Always amazing always worth the drive when I have time to go there."}
{"text":"THE place to go for German food in the Valley.  

Excellent schnitzels, plenty of good beer on draft, and a large, comfortable outdoor area.  Very heavy food, but delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. This time we came for my daughters birthday, service was really good ask for the brie and lingonberry appetizer, it's not on the menu but it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Yes went back with wife and kids again after state fair and listened to a live German band! Kids meals cooked to perfection I got the kilometer which was a killer kiebasa with sauerkraut and German potatoes, holy mackerel was that awesome!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here today (alas, didn't try the beer, things to do later...).  Overall, not too bad at all.  

Service was courteous and competent.  Hostess and server alike were warm and pleasant.

Atmosphere was pretty cool.  Walk in through a neat little beer garden/patio area (could see where this place would be great at night) into a very National Lampoon's European Vacation-like decor.  Clean, but not fancy (our bread plates were clearly from two different sets of china (one plain, one with elaborate printing)).  Overall very inviting and comfortable.  Our table was against the window facing Glendale Ave, so one could do some people watching...

Food was solid.  Started with simple potato pancakes w/ apple sauce and sour cream.  They were nicely seasoned and tasty, but probably frozen (nothing wrong with restaurants serving packaged food by the way... as long as it's good).  My wife had the chicken schnitzel which came out crisp-but-not-too-heavy on the outside and moist/tender on the inside.  The mushroom/wine sauce wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either.  I had a Big Griller (a rather phallic-looking footlong bratwurst served over sauerkraut.  It was quite yummy.  Strangely, the menu says \"Great with Curry Ketchup\", but it didn't come with any nor were we offered...   Just thought it was weird.

The price was very reasonable and overall a pleasant meal.  Not necessarily a place I'd drive to regularly, but if in the area, definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening. I got the meal Guy Fieri tried and the girlfriend got pasta mit vodka. We both enjoyed our meals. This place has a really fun atmosphere and you feel like you are in Germany while dining. Will be back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I was soooo excited to hear about a German Restaurant in Arizona. After visiting Berlin and Franfurt for a week, I absolutely fell in love with German food. 
While the service was great and prices were decent, the food was not as exciting as I thought it would be. For an appetizer, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. This was a great start to the meal because they were great. Possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Cream Sauce was amazing and the shredded sweet potato on top was a nice touch. That, along with my beer, were the best parts of the meal I would say. For dinner I chose the bratwurst with sour kraut and German potato salad, and my husband chose the paprika schnitzel with wersing and German fried potato's. Both of us had the soup of the day as well which was cream of mushroom. The soup was decent although it could have used a bit more salt. My meal was ok but comparing this to similar meals in Germany, I felt it was kinda boring and lacking. Also, the curry ketchup I ordered was not what I expected. Curry Ketchup in Germany is a lot like BBQ sauce in taste. The stuff I got at Haus Murphy's just didn't taste right to me. It tasted like ketchup with a curry aftertaste. Anyways, my husband did not like his paprika schnitzel at all. The flavor also seemed a bit odd. If you don't like curry, do not order this dish! The fried potato's were mediocre (kinda boring). The wursing, on the other hand, was very good. I think its because it had the same cream sauce as what was in the mushrooms. After dinner, we decided on bread pudding for dessert. This dessert definitely needed some work. There was not enough spice in it so it tasty like nothing more than bread soaked in eggs most of the time eating it. In any event, Haus Murphy's wasn't bad. I am rating it based on whether I would continue to go there and since I am in Maricopa and its in Glendale, the food would have to be spectacular to make me want to come back. Unfortunately, only a couple of small portions were close to being spectacular which I am not sure make it worth the time, effort, and money to return again."}
{"text":"Good food and service. The pretzel is home made and very good--We had their meat loaf,pork chops, and Hungarian Sausage and all were very good. We always enjoy eating there before going to Coyote Hockey Games."}
{"text":"First  time  there  read reviews, kind of old has charm but could use little  updating  inside. Server was ok,food was excellent, could put little more  applesauce  with pancakes . We sat inside by windows, sat at one table  then moved all could  use extra care wiping them off. Would  go back but would  leave if still grimy. So please give place some TLC."}
{"text":"A true classic in Glendale. The food is consistently excellent. You can't beat a place that serves beer by the liter."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch one day last week and I did not leave disappointed. We were able to sit outside in the shade, like most of the other lunch diners and the experience was quite enjoyable. My friend and I both ordered the Reuben sandwich and while it was ver-y greasy, still tasty. We topped it off with the chocolate sauerkraut torte and were not sorry. I think they were having Oktoberfest specials, but I do know that the piece of cake we ordered cost about the same as our sandwiches. Lol. Their menu was limited, and again, not sure if it was a special lunch/Oktoberfest thing. 

Our server was friendly enough but was very busy and it seemed like a lifetime between submitting a request and it actually getting accomplished (you know, like getting a straw) 

Great place in downtown Glendale. I'd love a more sour and less sweet sauerkraut, but that's just me. :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside and outside. I love the music on the patio and the relaxed atmosphere and people that go there. Such great comfort food! Good choice if in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Can you say schnitzel?

I love the Haus Murphy's.  Their newer location is bigger, so dinning with a group is a breeze now.  The food is awesome.  The sausage is top notch, the sausage  platter is obtuse.  I'm a schnitzel addict, so I always entertain one when I visit.  The Bread Pudding is fantastic, but as is all the dessertery.  It's a German place and the one pasta dish they have there is even killing.  It's a bit expensive, but worth it in every way.  

For the drinkers, it's a little bit of heaven.  They always have about 5 German beers on tap usually Franziskaner WeissBier, Warsteiner Dunkel, Spaten Optimator, A Weistephaner, and a Pilsner of German origin.  I used to hit up the happy hour here on a reg and deplete them on mustard and pretzels.  They also serve beers in the huge mugs if you're a drunk or just like big things."}
{"text":"This place is really good. You have to get a huge german beer and drink it while you eat a schnitzel it is delicious. One of the best restaurant meals I have in a long time. Can't say enough good things. Great food"}
{"text":"Ok, what do you get when you cross a cute downtown area, an oom-pah band, and some incredible food and drink? Haus Murphy of course!

Let's keep this simple:
     Sister's birthday, large party sat immediately
     Beautiful outdoor seating
     Unbeatable food - Pretzels!
     Fun selection of beverages
     Great service from a super-cute German waiter


I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening, and the place was pretty empty, especially since all the shops were closed for the night. 2 out of our 4 people had the goulash which was just alright. Oddly sweet for a meaty dish. 1 had the sauerbraten, which we found out was on Triple D, and it was surprisingly \"meh\" for a purported signature dish. The paprika schnitzel was the best dish by far. Portions were large, but I'm sure you could find better for the price. Having a truly fabulous German restaurant back home in the Chicago suburbs, this was a pale comparison."}
{"text":"Time to get your Polka on ... never thought I 'd wish I knew the moves to the Chicken Dance ..mid westerners help me out!! 
Haus Murphy just was plain ole fun tonight  , thanks to two Polka playing  Hawaiian-shirted, German loving musicians and a table  next to us full of celebrationistos  feeling no pain ,  we really enjoyed our time.  

The beer was flowing all around us , big mugs , giant mugs, lots of mugs.  Our large family group ordered lots of yummy homey foods  like German Meatloaf , which was rich and seasoned and moistened quite well . My husband and I ordered the giganto platter,the Bauernplatte for two was completely  awesome!  A  great eating challenge for my husband who can put away of truckload of food. This platter had a variety of meats including a wonderful chicken schnitzel, German potatoes, red cabbage , brats in assortment  and sauerkraut that tasted nothing like that stuff from a jar. 
We finished off dinner with some moist bread pudding like apple strudel that I thought tasted wonderful . I would love some more right now!!  Low carb diet  be gone!  Beware after such a big meal  1piece of strudel is enough for two people. 
Ambiance is  familyish , lots of people , and very fast service.  They have many long tables that serve big groups well. Looks like they are pros at  having a good time. Haus Murphy is a great place to take a family for fun ."}
{"text":"Part of my family is German and let me say this is definitely authentic food! The food is good and the beers are large. Everything is large. When you go, be prepared to take home a lot of food. I ordered the wiener snitzel and when it came I was overwhelmed. It fed me dinner for three nights!

The service was friendly but a bit confused. They didn't ask if we were ready to order, we had to ask to order and then they didn't ask the whole table but went back and forth putting orders in one at a time.

My friend had the kilometre, which was a huge sausage with a bit of spice to it. It was about 2 feet long! 

The atmosphere is cute and very pub like. The waiters are all dressed in German attire and they are playing German music. 

I would return again."}
{"text":"So this place is absolutely adorable and in the heart of old town Glendale. I wasn't as impressed with whatever I tried. But I was with a group and one of our friends picked the food so I'm not gonna base it off of that. I definitely want to go back and try it again. And this time I will pick what I want hahah. I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!

AGH!

Their Jager Schnitzel is sooooo good.  

However, I'm allergic to nuts and they told me all of their desserts are made off premis and they all contained nuts :(
Booooo nuts.

But yeah, good stuff.

Make reservations though, becasue everytime Ive been there it was fairly crowded."}
{"text":"Been here twice in alittle over a month. My girl favorite cake is German Chocolate so I took her there just for that on Valentine's day after we had dinner someplace else. She loved it and said it's probably the best German Chocolate she's had. So we went back there again today and we had just the cake again. She still said its the best she's had and I have to agree its very moist and just sweet enough. And they actually give u a good slice for the price compared to other places that give u a tiny sliver. One of these days we are going to actually have to try the food there. But for now whenever we want some German Chocolate Cake. This is our spot."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé just drove by and decided to try it!! It's such a cute little place. Good service. GREAT food"}
{"text":"Hostess sat us at a table we really didn't want to sit at outside so we asked to be moved. Usually at many other restaurants staff gets annoyed when I request a seating change (I'm picky... I admit it) but they were very accommodating and friendly which was great! 
Overall, I was very happy with the staff.. it was really busy due to Glendale Glitters but our server was as attentive as he could be.
I'm only giving three stars because yes, the food was good, but my schnitzel was soggy and I spent all night sick."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday night and it was a fabulous experience. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He answered any questions we had. The wait time was not bad at all. Of course the best part was the food. The pretzel shnitzel is amazing! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Every trip we take we look for German restaurants. This is not what I was expecting. Should have read more of the reviews. Schnitzel wasn't pounded anywhere near enough. The wirsing was something I've never had before nor heard of and won't try it again. Bratkartoffeln were really good. Sauerbraten was VERY dry and tasteless but spaetzle was good. 

Our server was very good. The apfel strudel and sauerkraut chocolate cake were very good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, I wish I could give it a higher star rating but the service was poor. We had our choice of seating: dining room, out door, bar area. We chose bar area to watch the football games. There were three of us but they seated us at a table barely large enough for 2. We tried it out and then chose to reseat ourselves to a larger table. They waiter did not complain or reprimand us so that was good. We ordered our drinks and appetizer since we knew what we wanted. We had to restate our drink order 4 times, once because they were out of the beer we requested another three times because the guy could not remember our request. How difficult is rum and coke, and two waters? We had to repeat our appetizer order twice because he 'wanted to make certain he placed the correct order.' While waiting to place our entre order, we were trying to watch the football game but 2 of the waiters were standing in front of the TV watching the game and blocking our view, we asked them twice if they could move to the left just a little bit, they never did move they just continued standing there. For entre we requested steak spatzel but they were out of steak so we finally settled on chicken spatzel. The chicken was very tender and servings were large. We had leftovers. I doubt I will go out of my way to revisit this place during my next visit."}
{"text":"This is probably the most old school authentic German restaurant that I have ever been to, and it is suuuuper cute, both inside and out.  It is located in downtown Glendale, and it is a great spot to stop at either before or after a Cardinals game or if you are simply on the west side of Phoenix.  The outdoor seating area is a cool spot to hang out in if the weather is nice.

All the food I have had there is absolutely delicious - I have tried several of their sausages, schnitzel, stuffed mushrooms, pork dishes, etc... and I LOVE LOVE LOVE their sauerkraut & spaetzle!!  

The service is always pretty decent, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is great - very relaxed, chill, and usually the managers are quite attentive... they will typically personally come check on you and ask if everything is okay, and make sure you enjoyed your meal!!  :)

If you love German food ... you should definitely try this place out, because it is AWESOME & AUTHENTIC!!"}
{"text":"Any other time, I would give Haus Murphys 5 stars. The  really let me down today. 

Really disappointed in Haus Murphys tonight. They completely dumbed down their menu for their Oktoberfest (which is grossly outside of the time line for traditional Oktoberfest anyway). 

Instead of a normally beautifully prepared jagerschnitzel with spatzle and red cabbage, I got a breaded pork loin patty with French fries."}
{"text":"Let me just start with \"OMG that Rueben sandwich was the best I've ever had\" It really was. It was so full of flavor, not like the ones I grew up on at home. Also, that Bavarian pretzel was as big as my head, which is pretty darn big, and pretty darn delicious. It only cost me $5. My boyfriend and I love the tomato soup, nothing like the canned stuff.It has some seasoning on it. The waiter was extremely kind and was happy we came by to eat there. We  have had that same waiter twice and even the other wait staff is friendly. How could someone not like this place.Now, I just need to try the schitzel clan."}
{"text":"Lived in Germany for 3 years! This was the best German food since we lived there. Everything we tried was excellent. Stuffed mushrooms, and bratt appetizer. Then we had beef soup. Main course We tried snitzel and topped of with sauerkraut chocolate cake. I wish we we're going to be here longer so we could go again. Definitely will return on our next trip."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed, but maybe German food isn't my thing?  Sorry I cannot provide more detail, but it was all pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"I was expecting a great meal and was terribly disappointed.  My meal was Weiner Schnitzel was cold and the waitress was very slow.  We believe a member of our party got food poisoning after eating the cabbage rolls.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Super delicious. Huge portions. Beers no one else has. If your looking for \"authentic German\" this is about as good as it gets in the American Southwest."}
{"text":"I like this area of Glendale. In the winter time it feels like a real city- people walking around, things to do... That's rare in Phoenix. So, the interior of this place isn't great, but the patio is nice. I have an addiction to soft pretzels and beer. Their pretzel is gigantic and delicious. I wish they had better quality pub cheese and mustard to compliment it. I'd come much more often."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere here are fantastic. I asked for a warm drink and the waitress asked if I liked wine and recommended the German spiced wine. Great suggestion! It was exactly what I was looking for a red wine that was warm and spiced nicely. We all shared the pretzel. Even my husband who is not usually a pretzel fan, ate his fair share. We both ordered the sauerbraten. This is where they lost me a bit. The spätzle didn't have any flavor, we wanted to try the potato dumplings, but unfortunately those are not available on the lunch menu, I should have checked that. The red cabbage was spot on. The Sauerbraten itself was just ok. I make my own at home from a 5th generation recipe passed down from my husband's German family. Theirs tasted nothing like mine, so while it wasn't what I expected, it wasn't bad either, just very sweet, and not enough of the sour vinegar kick we are used to. On the other hand my son enjoyed it which was unexpected, since he won't eat mine. I'd come here again and try some other dishes and maybe at dinner to try the dumplings."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for German food,  this is the place I come to.  In general the food is authentic.  They have entertainment, but it is hard to get a seat sometimes.  The one guy that plays the accordion is not my favorite.  I prefer to have a musician that has a personality while performing such as an occasional smile.  With that being said, beer helps.  Both inside and outside are nice for me and I will go back when I need to eat German food."}
{"text":"So after my first taste of German cuisine ('cause Weinerschnitzel doesn't count) I emailed my American friend living in Germany to ask if they really have any fruits and vegetables in Germany. Deep fried chicken, three types of sausage, German potato salad... Does red cabbage really count as a vegetable?  I'm not a big fan of sausage but I'm guessing the veal sausage is a little bland compared to what you might be able to find at a German Deli.  The chicken fried chicken was AMAZING and I highly recommend either that dish or the pork chop. I also thought the pretzel was worth coming back for.  I did not brave any German beer, but the house iced tea was fresh.  The wait staff was a bit overattentive, but better that than under attentive, yes? 

My American German friend was annoyed that I ate every German Food Stereotype for dinner. But since I'm not going to Germany anytime soon, I guess Haus Murphy's will do. He did confirm, however, that they DO have healthy food and fruits and vegetables there. ;)"}
{"text":"I worked in Glendale one college summer and was in love with this restaurant. The flirty waitress with neon blue hair might have had something to do with that. I'd come here for lunch all the time and sample various German dishes I'd never heard of before, always enjoying them. It's just a cool little mom and pop German joint. Not something you see every day in Arizona."}
{"text":"Very great service and staff. The food is delicious and everyone was so polite. They came over to check on us and talk to our big party. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really loved the homey feeling of this place. Very comfortable and extremely friendly but the food, meh.. it was hit and miss. Their brown gravy tasted like something from a grade school cafeteria which was a real let down. The potato dumpling bland and their 'giant' pretzel was smaller than the kind you get from snack bars. Also they no longer have rye bread with herb butter.. they use some bought dinner rolls, pretty lame! 

Now the good stuff.. the Bauernplatte for two was awesome! Heaping helping of sausages, kraut and friend taters.. was wonderful! The German potato salad was the best Ive had, just great!

So all the little stuff really took its toll for me on this place.. perhaps it was an off night for the kitchen? Its a pretty far drive to find out."}
{"text":"Shanon gave great service to our group of six.  The cabbage roll is good.  The owner is great."}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant a one star is pushing it a bit. 
  We had a bemusing night at this restaurant Saturday night, March 26.  We were also quite surprised at the reviews listed here.  It really doesn't sound like the restaurant that we ate at.
    We ordered the rouladen, Jaeger schnitzel, and schweizer schnitzel, our favorites from our years living in Europe.  
    The rouladen was tough and the stuffing was unusually chunky.  
    The schweizer schnitzel was deep fried to near jerky status.  Dry and tasteless.
    The jaeger schnitzel was a little better but the gravy and mushrooms didn't taste fresh reminiscent of something out of an envelope.
    There was no german salad and you were charged extra for bread.  
   Service was most amusing.  Our waiter needed a little more training.  He told us that Brotchen was German for stale bread, NOT.  We also heard him tell a neighboring table that all German wine was sweet.  
    We love German food so we try out German restaurants often in the hopes of finding one close to authentic.  Haus Murphy's is definitely not a German restaurant which could be alright if the food was edible.  Our recommendation is to avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. Great place for long tables, being able to hear everyone with the option of fun live accordian music as well. Excellent beers, and yummy food. Heat lamps outdoors which was great but by the end of the night we were trying to steal them surrounding tables. Be prepared if sitting outdoors!"}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC German cuisine in a funky, artsy area.  We really had a nice family dinner that night on our Scottsdale area vacation, and we have Guy Fieri's show to thank for the idea, and Haus Murphy's staff to thank for the experience.  My Husband lived in Germany during his time in the military, so this was a step back in time and memories of the cooking he used to enjoy from a neighbor when he lived off-base.  For our Son and I, it was just an enjoyable night out to eat at a restaurant we would not likely have known about had the place not been featured on Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives on the Food Network.  Don't shy away from the dark beers - the staff can help you make the choices.  The ambiance is a step back in time, but in a good way.  The staff is jovial and seems genuinely pleased by people who appreciate their food.  This is a must-stop if you're in the Phoenix area.  It was an easy drive from Scottsdale, and we would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Outstanding German food and a great atmosphere, especially on nights when they have love polka. Love everything I've had on the menu-the eisbein is especially delicious and tender and all the sides (sauerkraut, spatzle, German potatoes). Have tried menu items like wursts and shnitzels elsewhere and none are as flavorful or well prepared. A little pricey but you definitely get your money's worth. Be prepared to wait, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Greeting was polite but terse; nothing friendly going on here but nothing rude, particularly. Pretzel was amazing. Chicken Schniztel was really, really bland and dry and the sauce was a little greasy. Service was adequate but didn't leave me with any warm and fuzzy feelings (and my glass was empty for a while and I was never offered a refill...that's never good.) 

The worst part, however, was that we felt we were being pressured to finish up and leave by the server. The restaurant was not that busy and this--on top of the lukewarm service to begin with--made it a \"meh\" and not an \"a-okay\". 

We might go back someday for a beer and pretzel but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date once. I'm not a huge German fanatic and don't know much about German anything but this place is an experience if you want to feel like you are actually eating dinner in a German pub. Fun live music while you eat. The beer is tasty as ever and it is definately something to try at least once! I didn't even know what shnitzel was. I'll tell you what it was....DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is great and the bartender made good suggestions. The Saurbraten iis the best I have ever had. The brats were a favorite with the kids. The staff is very friendly too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Do you want an escape from your typical Arizona dining experience? Do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional German clothing holding tubas? You really need to check this place out. I live about 5 minutes from here and it took me a full year and visiting relatives to finally get to downtown Glendale to check it out. 

We had a 6:30 reservation on the patio (It was a Saturday and I wanted to be safe but for 4, you could have done without the reservation). We sampled several German beers and I loved them all (wish I remembered the names). We started with the giant pretzel and sausage sampler-both were SO good I am still drooling. The Sausages were served over a bed of sauerkraut and the pretzel with spicy mustard. Everyone at the table tried something different and we all sampled everything. I loved the German potato salad served with the entrees and also the cabbage soup. 

The ambiance of this place was fantastic! The live music is from 6-8 and I really wish it went later. My boyfriend and I agree that eating there really makes you feel as though you are on vacation-far away from Arizona! I would HIGHLY recommend this place-great spot for anyone and especially out of towners looking for something unique!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great staff and atmosphere, a little on the pricey side, but for the food portions, quality and authenticity, totally worth it! My husband came out for an early dinner which happened to be during the Oktoberfest Happy hour, half off appetizers and certain brews. 
I ordered the Brie and hubby got a 5oz pretzel. Dinner was phenomenal! So good and too much to finish! We each had to have boxes to go, but still insisted on grabbing a couple of desserts for the road ( apple and cherry streusel) 
2 appetizers, drinks, entrées, and desserts for about $44 was pretty reasonable for this kind of place. Overall great place to eat and the staff was great and accommodating! It's a little out of the way to drive for me ( about 30 minutes from where we live) so we won't be going as often as we'd like, but I would highly recommend this place for a late lunch or dinner! 
They take cards and reservations!"}
{"text":"First of all I found the historic part of Glendale to be attractive and fun. This restaurant is old fashion with old generation German music playing and decor that would remind you have a country restaurant in Bavaria.  I knew after one bite of the salad that I would like this restaurant.  The dressing was creamy but light in a way that only the Europeans know how to do.  I would say the same about the cream sauces on the Schnitzel.  While having the nice flavor of cream it was light.  They serve beer the way it is served in Germany--luke warm which was perfect.  The waitresses wore traditional German clothing and I enjoyed the entire experience.  I also had the cherry strudel with ice cream which was yummy and reminds of something my grandmother would make.  This restaurant is not chic or fancy but it is homey and the food is delicious German comfort food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now. The service is always friendly, the food is always good, and the beer is always large :)

My brother-in-law and I like to come here and eat some good food and have a nice large cold beer. The pretzel is always crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

I personally love the Chicken Schniztel with the Mushroom sauce. The Apple Streudel and and Bread Pudding are really amazing. The Lentil soup literally tastes like the way my grandmother used to make it (not to sound corny, but it's true). 

My favorite beer is the Franziskaner Wiessbeer which I did not see last time, but they have the \"Dunkel\" version of it which is good, it's just darker. I also really enjoy the Spaten Optimator.

Between the great staff, food, and beer, can't go wrong! 

p.s. make sure you wear stretchy pants, because after just the pretzel and the bit jug of beer you'll need to stretch out a bit....."}
{"text":"Best authentic German restaurant in Phoenix hands down! Family owned and, Rose and Chef William do a great job and make you feel right at home with not only their food but exceptional hospitality. Tonight was yet another great time at Haus Murphy's, it was packed with a big line out the door, full capacity and they killed it making sure everyone was sat and got their food and drink as fast as possible while not losing the quality in the food and atmosphere. Food was great again, as well as spirit and atmosphere! Thanks again HM!!"}
{"text":"I would give them one star based on their food and beer but their staff is so nice. I have been here many times since I am from Glendale and my folks still live there. They love Haus Murphy's but even before I married a German I thought this place tasted bland and couldn't be authentic. After I took my husband there with the fam, he agreed the food was so far from authentic, except for the soup. The only thing I would ever order there is their soup.  Besides for The Spicery (not sure if still open) downtown Glendale's restaurants have really gone downhill. Sad."}
{"text":"Best German food in Phoenix. Great service, friendly staff, authentic atmosphere, and fantastic food. They make sauerkraut into ambrosia"}
{"text":"We ordered the Anniversary Special and it was not only the most amazing tasting dish, it was only $20 for a meal for two! The Dunkle beer was one of the best I've had. Service was outstanding and I'm already looking forward to my 2nd visit!"}
{"text":"I was walking around during the Chocolate Affair and my aunt said she saw this restaurant on tv and that it looked pretty decent. So we went and put our names on the waiting list (the wait time for the night was one and a half hours) and we continued to walk around the chocolate affair. We then returned an hour later and they were still pretty packed and we finally after two hours got into the restaurant, we knew it was a busy night so we were pretty understanding of all the chaos the servers and crew were going through and we were patient and polite to all of them. 
Our waitress was some blonde girl who wasn't returning the patient and polite manner. She was rude and condescending towards us. After about 15 min we FINALLY received the drinks we wanted (water) and our soup came out as well. My aunts friend who was joining us that evening wanted to save the soup to eat with her main course so she set it off to the side occasionally taking a few spoonfuls. The waitress clears my aunts and my soup bowl. Then she returns doesn't say a word and as my aunts friend reached for her soup the waitress snatches it, takes it away and doesn't return.
Finally after about 15-20 minutes she comes back and my aunts friend said she wasn't done with her soup. The waitress then begins to argue with her saying she needs to speak up next time. But in reality shouldn't the waitress have asked? So the waitress leaves, comes back with more soup and plops it on the table. A bit of soup fell out of the bowl as she did that. Then she doesn't say \"sorry\" and just goes over to her other tables.
The owner of the restaurant, a sweet woman from Germany, is doing her rounds asking how everything is. My aunt explains to her what happened and the owner even said \"we usually have problems with her being rude and snippy to other employees not customers.\" So she ended up changing our waitress out for a nice waiter named Chris (I think). He was absolutely so much better and he was so nice. Our food came out about 45 minutes to an hour after we had originally sat, the owner explained that the kitchen was incredibly backed up and that they actually had to close the restaurant down for the rest of the night. Dinner was delicious, I had the spicy brat and the german potatoes are amazing. 
Our experience was alright, we knew it was a busy night and that our food would take awhile to be brought out. That one waitress just really needed an attitude check and understand that even though your night might be busy and a bit stressful, it's still your job to be courteous and kind to each of your customers. And we were nothing but kind and patient with her until she decided to be rude. But if you ever eat at this restaurant I recommend the spicy bratwurst and for your waiter to be Chris."}
{"text":"As a German, I am very picky with my German food. We went here for dinner last Saturday evening. Jack ordered the pork shank which was decent though certainly not as good as some. They were out of my first choice, Sauerbraten, so I got the Nürnberger Sausages with Sauerkraut. The sausages were a little larger than they are supposed to be. They were not grilled enough and the flavor was way to mild, diluted one could say. The Kraut was somewhere in between the more sour Frankfurt style and the sweeter Nürnberg style. Our friend had the Gulasch. It had a nice sauce but the meat was dry.

But they had good German Schnaps (we had Obstler) and Beer."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is fun place place to go for German meals and it has a lot of fans.  I found them to be a little dated with their decor and their food is usually cooked well done or over cooked.  Their service is A~OK.

Food feedback:
Apps ~ 
Sausage Sampler, Bratwurst/Krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade Sauerkraut is tasty! 
Potato Cakes,  served with a side of Apple Sauce and sour cream was a bit overcooked very dry. 
The Giant Bavarian Pretzel Imported 10oz. salted Pretzel is highly over rated and was not cooked evenly. 

Meals ~ 
Their beef & pork sausages are all served over their homemade sauerkraut with German potato Salad or fries.
Bier Bratwurst - Beef-Pork Sausage is good.
German Bratwurst - Pork Sausage is bland.
Krakauer Wurst - Polish spicy Beef-Pork Sausage is awesome! 

Their Schnitzel's are good but again overcooked at times. I preferred their Steak Schnitzel topped with a Gorgonzola cheese and Roasted Onion Sauce.  Served with German Fried Potatoes and Bacon Roasted Green Beans. 

Beers~
Spaten Lager or Weihenstephan Hefeweizen are best, you cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went in for a cold beer on a warm afternoon. Didn't eat this trip, only quenched our thirst with a good cold liter. Enjoyed the beer garden atmosphere and friendly service. Good selection of German beer and different size options. Will definitely go back to try the food."}
{"text":"The schnitzel was a good portion but despite that still not worth the somewhat steep price. The paprika version of the schnitzel may be a house specialty a featured on TV (hype warnings were triggered when I learned of their TV status) but if I were to go back I'd go for something different. The appetizers which were good but not enough for us to order again.

Our server was friendly (though our hostess seemed utterly indifferent) but it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered before we received our food because \"the ovens weren't on yet and filled with pots.\" This was after killing an hour waiting for the kitchen to open despite their website saying they were open.

Overall it was good. That's it. Glad we came. Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is a must when in the area. I've been here twice and look forward to another visit soon. The German food is excellent. Everything I've had has been excellent. The staff is helpful describing the menu and offering their favorite selections. The food comes out within a reasonable time. It is reasonable priced and so good. Seriously if you have not been here you are missing out and need to try it out. The sauerkraut is amazing defiantly not from the can defiantly home made (like everything on the menu)!"}
{"text":"What a great time and it's in an awesome location!  

This place is the go to if you're looking for authentic German food in the valley!  

We went and sat outside while we dinned.  It was a great time, felt like being in Germany for a little bit which was nice.  Everything here is as authentic as can be without leaving the state.  They even have a traditional German band that will sit outside and play while you dine to round out the experience.    

The beers are served in traditional German sizes, some bigger than your head!  As always German beer is well above average and you won't be disappointed with whatever one you get.

The food again is very traditional.  Try the pretzels that they have imported, it's bliss in a twisted, salted package.  We had the Guinness brats and the jäger schnitzel.  The jäger sauce was very good and they defiantly seem to know what they are doing here."}
{"text":"Quantity over quality.  Split a combo for 2 with the wife - was a HUGE heaping plate of meat and we walked out with plenty of leftovers.  Good but not great - schnitzel was soggy and sausages came out lukewarm like they're just sitting in a giant, greasy tub in the kitchen to be tonged out en masse.  I liked their mustards - just the right amount of flavor and not over powering, helped make up for the flat taste of the sausages.  Overall, the place has a nice atmosphere with an old town bar feel, though it does have a weird stale smell when you first walk in.  Band on Friday a nice touch, but a bit repetitive.  Table next to the us got a giant pretzel that looked pretty awesome - I'd come back for that and a German beer.  I'd rate this place 4 stars as a bar, but only 3 as a restaurant."}
{"text":"Good, solid, stick-to-your-ribs German food here. Can be a bit pricey, but worth a visit. Check out the nice little bier garden on a spring day."}
{"text":"Made the 30 minute drive from north Phoenix & glad we did. Bar tender was great to talk to while waiting for our table. Great German (&Austrian) beer selection. Bloody Mary hade A1 steak sauce in it (really good)
Food was very authentic . ( we go to Germany every year on business) We will go back soon."}
{"text":"If you like schnitzel.. this is the place for you. Authentic German food and beers. Reasonably priced too. We do not usually get dessert but the cherry strudel was the perfect size and delicious."}
{"text":"I ventured out to Haus Murphy's since it's not far from my office and I was looking for a good Reuben and a Yelp'er had noted they had a good Reuben. 
The atmosphere at Haus Murphy's is very nice out on the patio (i didn't make it inside) and down town Glendale adds to it's ambiance. 
So let's get to the Reuben. Average, and over priced at $9.95. It came with German potato salad that i like but for the price and service I don't think I will be back for lunch. When you consider that wholesale corn beef cost $3.49 / pound and they put less than a 1/4 pound on the sandwich it was very disappointing. And the German potato salad was good but come on potatoes are cheep. Is it just because Glendale is a high rent district? Well the Haus of Murphy may have a lot going for it but it's not going to win over the casual lunch crowed that's for sure."}
{"text":"What a neat place in downtown Glendale.  It really doesn't get any more authentic.  And if it does, let me know!  From our server, to our food, to our drinks, everything was great.  

Don't go here, and expect to not get real German and then complain that it didn't taste the way you would have wished..  I read a few reviews of this place, and I think it's funny that people complain about the food.. What do you expect?  It's not going to be your traditional American fare..  That's my rant.  I'll stop now..

I had the gulash and it was yummi.  i also tried the chicken schnitzel and some sausage and it was all really good.  The paprika soup was great, and the bread basket was also delicious.  I ordered a potato dumpling, and I didn't like it at all!   My only complaint.

There were some guys playing an accordian and a tuba outside, and all the wait staff dresses in German attire.

Fun fun night!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! First time at a German restaurant and it was delicious! Don't pass up the sauerkraut chocolate cake - best chocolate cake you'll ever have! Plus, the staff was friendly and efficient. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because their menu is way too big and the servers have to dress in poorly fitted costumes. Overall, our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Have had this place bookmarked in my yelp for over a year and finally stopped in tonight
The food was solid.  I haven't had jaeger schnitzel since being in Munich two years ago and I was not disappointed in Haus Murphy's!
The pretzel and giant radler was a great way to start the meal and the cherry strudel was an awesome finish
If this place is on your list, check it out sooner rather than later.  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Went with a large group for a birthday party. We had two of the long tables in the back. Street parking only. Good luck finding a spot on a busy Friday or Saturday night. 

The decor: everything German. You feel like you are at grandma's with the mix matching plates and wooden chairs. Lots of cheesy German posters on the wall. 

The staff: very friendly. They close at 9 and we left close to 10. They were very nice about it and didn't kick us out. The server was willing to multiple checks for the couples in the goup. The service was a bit slow but it might have been because we were a big group. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu which was helpful. 

 food: everyone on Yelp raved about the big pretzel ($5) so we had to do it. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I think I had it  hyped up in my head that it did not meet the expectation. Others loved it. Also tried the stuffed mushrooms. Only 4 come in a an order for $10. That was disappointing but they were good. We got the veal sausage ($11) and the filet medallions ($16). My fiance loved his veal sausage and I only kind of liked my dinner. The brown sauce was pretty heavy and medallions were not med. rare as promised - more like medium. Every meal also comes with a soup. It was not so good but I like the concept. Maybe just not my taste. My meal also came with mashed potatoes (yum) and red cabbage (super yum). 

drink: the steins of beer were 1 liter. Translation - an S ton of beer for $8!"}
{"text":"Funny thing is, we took our forgeign exchange \"son\" here for some  comfort food."}
{"text":"Looking to surprise spouse while in Phoenix with good German. Of course, the Rouladen was not as good as her Mom's, but then again, I am sure there never will be one that competes with \"Mom's.\"

Other than competing with Mom's, the food and service were excellent.  The Rouladen, though not Mom's, was thoroughly enjoyed, the Brats, German potatoes, sauerbraten and spatzel were delicious. Desserts, wow!!  Got to try the sauerkraut cake - it's a chocolate lover's delight."}
{"text":"I was reading the reviews about haus murphy after my dad had made the reservations for the night.  Good reviews so I was looking forward to having dinner there

Started off with a brown lager beer which was very good.  My sister got the unfiltered wheat beer. Very good choices to unwind and relax after walking around the town square seeing the Christmas lights  

For appetizers we did the stuffed mushrooms and the soft Bavarian pretzel  with the spicy mustard.  Wow.  The mushrooms were perfect and very tasty.  The pretzel is huge and the mustard was a good addition to the pretzel.  Make sure you order both when you go there.   

Next thing that came was the chefs soup which comes with the main course.  Cream of mushroom soup.   It was OK.   

All of us decided to have the meatloaf with sautéed green beans and German potato salad.   I know we should have tried something different to get a good selection but the meatloaf sounded great.  I tell you what.   It did not disappoint anyone at the table.  Very good.     

Only thing I wish I would have tried is some of the desserts but after the mushrooms, pretzel and the meatloaf, all of us were stuffed.  

I think it would be a good idea to just go there for desserts.  

Good choice for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Haus Murphy's at least once every couple of years since I moved to Glendale when I was a wee lass over 20 years ago. My dad was always obsessed with this place due to his love of German food and the movie Murphy's Romance. 

The menu has changed little over the years. When I was a kid I really liked the schnitzel they served that had ham and cheese on top, almost like a schnitzel cordon bleu. Now I enjoy the Jagerschnitzel whenever we go. The food is always just ok. Never mind blowing. Never terrible. 

Now that I'm a grown-up, I feel like I should really come here more often to enjoy the beer garden and have some brews, but it's usually still a family affair, and there are fun places to drink closer to where I live. I like the eclectic decor and vibe, but rarely find myself drawn here."}
{"text":"Great place, food was delicious. They had the typical German beers on tap. I had the Saurbrauten and the apel strudel, I highly recommend both. The staff was friendly and the environment was fun."}
{"text":"The hubby had his heart set on taking me here, but I was a little worried because of the negative reviews, I really don't like bland food.  Well, we did not have that! The food was full of flavor, well seasoned, big servings, prepared well.  The beer was GREAT, I am sorry I can't remember the name of the one we had... It was the dark one, that was light but tasted like a dark :) haha! Hope that helps! I had the schnitzel, a pork one with Swiss and ham... I would not order it again, but not because there was something wrong with it, it just wasn't my thing, I went on the recommendation of the waitress, but I have different taste... The hubby had a sausage, same story as the schnitzel, except he liked it and would order it again.  The pretzel was very good!! The soup was good.  I LOVED the spatzel (noodles).  I stirred in butter and salt and pepper... YUM, I could make a meal out of that and the German potato salad!! and beer and pretzels!!"}
{"text":"Love their Weiner schnitzel ala Holstein! Best ever. You have to request it in advance as they don't have it all the time."}
{"text":"Last Thursday I had the pleasure of joining a bunch of Yelpers at a UYE here.  I had not been here in over 10 years and they have move East on Glendale a bit since then.  At that time they were out of sauerbraten so they served us a stew of sorts that wasn't on the menu and I remember it being quite good and large plates of food.

I still desired to try their sauerbraten so that is what I ordered.  It comes with a potato dumpling, gravy, and red cabbage.  I expect a piece of beef marinated for three days to not require a knife to cut and to have some flavor of it's own before dowsing it in gravy, and sauerbraten I have had before met this.  This one to me was quite chewy and the gravy too sweet.  Gravy is one of those things that just because I think it is too sweet doesn't make it bad or improperly made, it just didn't suit my taste.  If I had liked the gravy better it would have improved my image of the dumpling which, without gravy, was sort of tasteless.  The red cabbage was just as I expected and have had before.

Now that I have grumbled about my meal.  I got a bite of a big pretzel two of which the restaurant comped us.  I thought it was a bit salty but overall a very pleasant surprise.  I chose to try mine with butter.  The bread pudding was delicious, I chose the small size and it was easily enough for two to share, but I ate it all anyway. :-)  All of this food was washed down with a good tasting Spaten lager.  The service was pretty good, especially for our large group.  And they were willing to split the checks, which even with a party of about 18 did not have the mandatory added gratuity, although I doubt if anybody in our party tipped less than 18% because they was nothing wrong with the service to warrant a poor tip.  The owner didn't introduce himself but he did make a couple of appearances on the patio to see how things were going.

I could easily be enticed to come back to the patio and enjoy a beer.  I think I would opt for one of the appetizers like a pretzel or the potato pancakes to soak the beer up with."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here a few weeks ago.  I had raved and raved about this place to her because every single time I had been there before, it was one of the best meals I have had in Glendale.  But boy, was this last go around a real kick to the groin.

Meal:  I had the pork schnitzel and the potato pancakes.  My fiance, who is a vegetarian, couldn't get anything except for the potato pancakes because they had a scaled down menu during the holiday season. Seriously?  After I called to get reservations and check the websites, you would have figured that they would have mentioned something about a smaller menu than what is typical.

Taste:  Out of all my meals at Haus Murphy's, this was by far the worse.  My food was cold, bland, and they didn't have my favorite beer on tap like they typically do.  Again- scaled down menu.  I got the impression that at least during the holiday season they just pre-cook everything well in advance and just microwave it when ordered.  4 out of 10.

Value:  When I used to go to Haus Murphy, I never got really worked up about value because the good was always good and it was so different compared to most places in Phoenix.  But this time around, given that the menu was compacted and the food wasn't very good, I would the the overall value of my last experience was pretty poor.  2 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Beyond the menu issue, our serve was pretty decent.  She was polite and friendly.  She didn't go above and beyond but at least she wasn't ruin.  But again . . . the shorten menu . . . that's what really hurts the score this time.  4 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is always fun here.  The big steins.  The music.  Everyone is dressed up.  4 out of 5.

Overall:  I will give Haus Murhpy's one more try and hopefully they will earn back their typical 5 start performance.  14 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am broken hearted!  I adore German food I've eaten it all over the country and prepared it dozens of times. The spätzle they served me was more like bad spaghetti. I almost cried. The red cabbage must have been prepared 3-4 days ago as it was mushy and almost inedible. I'm pretty sure at that point my eyes welled up. But what brought the tear down my cheek was the jaeger schnitzel.  The center was barely done and the edges were like shoe leather!  They didn't pound it properly and poof they made me cry. But I'm a sucker for bread pudding and I thought maybe their forte is dessert, it is NOT it was dense and almost tasteless. Sad. Very sad.
 If Guy Fieri had this food and was ok with it. They need to give me his job! If not he should stop lying to us!  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Angela was our waitrss, very personable and helpful explaining the menu options as well as the beer selection.
We tried the pretzel and was shared with 4 adults, we also added the cheese sauce which I would pass on next time, they charged $2.50 just for that item. The two mustards were great, house spicy and sweet mustard. BTW the pretzel was out of this world.
I tried the Haxe and the wife ordered the Cabbage Roll. Both items were good, not fantastic.
Four of us shared the Kraut Chocolate Cake, OMG it was marvelous. So the whole night started out great with the Pretzel and ended super with the Kraut Cake.
Don't miss the entertainment in the bar two musicians playing polka music, it was fantastic.
Will definitely return and next time I will dance a few polka's."}
{"text":"2nd meet up for the International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) for 2014 and Haus Murphy was the place picked to try! 

It was a big group this time; we took 2 tables, holy cow!! Our server was a little frazzled about having to deal with this. We were pretty darn close to the bar and our server told me that he was not taking any drink orders until everyone had arrived and I had already known some were 10 to 15 mins out, so off to the bar I went!  

I'm still fairly new to the whole ordering beer, so when I walked up to the bar the bar tender asked what do I like, and I told him I'm still unsure, since I'm new to drinking beer, he said oh you must be 21 haha Love him!! He offered me samples of all the beers they have on tap, which I thought I was pretty sweet and I went with a nice glass of Warsteiner Dunkel, it went perfectly well with everything! Kudos to the bar tender!   When I had already ordered my drink my server came to me and told me well I'm taking drink orders now, and I told him you told me to go to the bar and get my own drink so I did and I have.  

Everyone placed their order, even folks who arrived 20 mins late got their order in, everyone except me got their food, even my daughter who was on the same check as me, ten minutes go by and the server noticed I didn't have my meal, oh it must have been forgotten. UGH!!!! I was upset!! But within minutes my food appeared and I took a bite and OMG ITS DELISH!!! and being upset slowly faded away, one could say I ate my feelings LOL (not really)   I ordered the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing, it did also come with a bowl of split pea soup, which was amazing, reminded me of the times I went to Pea Soup Andersen's in California, so good! The schnitzel with mushroom gravy was soo yummy!! Couldn't believe I ate it all!! It also came with fried taters and this Irish girl luvs them taters & wirsing, it was my 1st experience with that, didn't even know what I was eating when I started, it was creamy melty goodness, learned it was cream cabbage, omg really? That was dang good!

But what I came for was the Sauerkraut Cake, yea that's right, sauerkraut cake!!! I have heard nothing but praise for this cake, they said its better than a death by chocolate cake!! I had to find out for myself!! OOOOMMMMYYYYYGGGAAAWWWDDD!!!! It's amazing!!  

Sometimes the company makes the evening more pleasurable then the overall experience & the food was simply delicious , service well that could have been better.  I'm already craving some more schnitzel so I see myself coming back soon."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a pretzel, bratwurst and chocolate sauerkraut cake. Carlene was super accomplishment and her recommendations were spot on!"}
{"text":"Ugh, I would really like to like this place. 

Getting to the location is awful, traffic is painfully slow since there are no left turn signals on the main street. Parking was okay since it was Saturday afternoon, but having to re-park every two hours kinda sucked and the food was bland!! I have been to Germany, and all the dishes I had there were flavorful, and yummy...but this place? bland and embarrassing. 

I met a group there to play board games and the staff was so nice and great! But the turkey sandwich with horseradish mayo was dry and gross. I ordered it thinking the mayo would throw me off but \"hey, it's a German restaurant, let's give it a whirl\" I couldn't even taste the special mayo! My homemade sandwiches have more flavor than this one. 

I ordered the apple strudel hopeful for some redeeming quality to compliment the great service...0-2, again like the Compass Restaurant, the best thing about the dessert was the sliver dollar shot of whip cream. 

This place was so accommodating and fun to hang out at, with really nice service...but I wish I could have something nice to say about the food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants, The Staff although a bit eccentric fits the place to a T.  A wide selection of German Beer's including Spaten, and Warsteiner, I personally prefer the Spaten Oktoberfest, 

They don't know how to make bad soup, I just wish they gave you more, every time we've been here they've always had simple but awesome soup.

And of Course \"Schnitzel\" or as they call it on the menu

\"The Art of Schnitzel\" if pounding pork thin breading it then covering it with sauces, other meats, cheeses etc, is an art form, then consider me a discerning critic.  Though I must admit I tend to order the Schweizer Schnitzel, which has Ham and Emmanthaler cheese under the breading.

We've had the desserts in the past and the Strudel is very memorable, as well as the german chocolate cake.

Maybe this year we'll make it out for their actual Oktoberfest celebration, we've been meaning to go for years.

When I think of glendale I don't think of Germans, but this place makes me more and more want to take a vacation to Germany."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now.  My father is from Germany and we took him here as a treat, he really liked it and the food was \"authentic mostly\".  I also went with my son and husband for Oktoberfest celebration with my German Club and the food was remarkable that night.  I enjoy eating here but I will say the down side for me, simply, not enough beer choices.  I am a stout and ale kind of girl and they only had one and it was not great.  My son loved the food and often asks when we will be going back.  I highly recommend this place but be sure of one thing, it fills up fast and the seating is a little tight (meaning they don't have a lot of space) and unless the patio is open you may have a wait time!"}
{"text":"Haus Murphy, what happened?!  Our family has eaten at Haus Murphy many times in the past with great results, but our recent visit there was a disaster.

First, what went right:  our party of 7 was seated on time at 7p.  Drink orders were taken by our friendly waitress, although the restaurant was out of Optimator, the favorite beer of one of our party. Our food order was taken promptly after that and soup appeared a few minutes later, as expected.  The oompah band was fun, as usual!

What didn't work:  Our entrees were delivered at 8:30p, a full hour after the soup and 1.25 hours after our initial order!  When we commented/questioned the long wait, we received no apology from the waitress, but were told they were busy.  This long-standing Glendale restaurant is always busy so that reason seemed pretty lame.  Six of our dinners were then served.. The dinner ordered \"without bacon\" was served 15 minutes later, when everyone else was at least half done eating.  One of the dinners served came out with a kitchen substitution as they had run out of spaetzle.  Isn't that like a Chinese kitchen running out of rice?!  Ironic that according to the menu, substitutions are not allowed by the customer at Haus Murphy so you'd think they wouldn't automatically substitute either, but instead inform the customer when they are out of an item and let them choose what to do. The person ordering the dinner did so because spatzle is his favorite and therefore accepted goulache to get the spaetzle.  His preference is smoked pork chop - no spaetzle allowed for that entrée however.

To be fair, two of our party really enjoyed their dinners (schnitzel and spicy brats), but the other four did not.  The waitress said she would ask the manager to stop by our table.  He did not so she asked him a second time.

The manager did apologize for the evening, the beer and food they were out of, the bad timing on service, and the unevenness of the food temps, but did not seem interested in hearing our concerns.  He was dismissive to us, but did remove the cost of one of the dinners in response.  

We're left wondering how this could have been such a good restaurant, a favorite for years, that had so many problems."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at the Haus, but I'm pretty up front as to not being a food reviewer and more of a booze reviewer, thus I feel completely confident that I can say Haus Murphy's is likely one of the great places in the PHX area to refresh yourself with a disgustingly large beverage.

When I was visiting the Glendale area we decided to eschew the corporate Westgate area for Downtown and a better decision has never been made. The Haus served us giant German beers outside.  They were large enough for us to take pictures of ourselves hiding behind them! What more do you want out of life?

Having grown up in the german-centric area of northwest Ohio, I have some sense of authentic German establishments, and this place has it in spades. Again, I'll leave the assessment of their food up to you, but if you're downtown and want to wet your palette with a giant fine German lager, you can't do better than Haus Murphy's. When I'm there, Ich bin ein Berliner."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy is getting 4 BIG stars! Why not 5 you ask? Only because they are in Glendale and it takes an ungodly amount of time to trek out there. With that being said... 

I have been to Murphy's 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. I have never been to Germany or another really authentic German restaurant, save the German buffet at Epcot Center, so I don't think that really counts. The restaurant is on the smaller side and it can be very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation. They do have a nice beer garden outside where you can eat as well, weather permitting. They have a few larger booths in the front room, but have a large open area with tables and some community type tables in the bar area. I believe they have a polka band there on the weekends also. So if polka music is your bag you should check it out. 

On to the important stuff. Food and beer! Again, their food has been consistent all 3 visits. They have a simple salad that comes with most entrees, but the dressing is awesome! The mushroom soup is great too! They also bring out warm, fresh pumpernickel and sourdough I believe. I have tried the chicken with mushrooms and cream sauce, the rouladen, and the meatloaf. I can't remember the name for the meatloaf, but that is essentially what it is. It comes with mashed potatoes and cabbage. It is fantastic! I believe it was served with a brown sauce/gravy. The offer a very large selection of beers. I have had the Spaten Lager and the Spaten Oktoberfest. Both quality. You have to get them in the large glass steins they offer. Lets keep it authentic folks. 

The desserts are pretty good too. The Apple Strudel was very good, but does have nuts. If you can pick around them I would suggest it. The Black Forest cake was a little dry, but good. 

If you live nearby or don't mind driving go and give Haus Murphy's a try."}
{"text":"A Friday afternoon of lounging in the beer garden at Haus Murphy's definitely tops my list of favorite things to do. Start with a glass of Weizen, a tall one, then cruise through their extensive menu of Bavarian specialties. 

Schnitzel or brats with a side of kraut , black forest ham sandwich, oriental chicken salad(?!), perhaps a strudel for dessert. I opted for the Reuben sandwich on my last visit. Though quite tasty, the corned beef was sliced a bit too thick for my taste- the deli down the street has them beat hands down. Stick with the sausage."}
{"text":"Whether I stop in here for a beer and giant pretzel with cheese for a snack while shopping in Glendale, or going to dinner for their Wiener schnitzel or old tyme brat. I love this place every time, I've been coming here with my family for years and we love it every single time. Reminds me of the little German town back home in Texas, Fredericksburg. If you're ever close by even if you just stop by for a beer and pretzel, the environment is amazing here. Inside the restaurant or out on the patio, especially now during the holiday seasons. It's a must if you're ever in Glendale !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for German food, this is where you want to be.  I think German food is a little boring, but every now and then a schnitzel sounds good. We tried most of the appetizer menu. They were good but not extraordinary. I would definitely get a schnitzel that sounds good to you though! We tried two and they were both perfect!"}
{"text":"Went on my birthday, service was great, food not so good. Have eaten there many times in the past and food was 5stars all the way. I had the Yeager Schnitzel gravy too thick and cold. Times must be tough as if you want rolls,it will cost you an additional 2.50 I'm wondering if the restaurant has changed ownership."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to Murphy's probably 4 times; each time we try something different, and each time we love what we get.

The atmosphere is great on Friday/Saturday nights, and on certain nights they have a band play German polka music, which adds to the experience.

The food, although relatively expensive, is priced well considering how much you get and how good it tastes.  The beer is quite expensive, but you can try some pretty unique German beers, so for some it may be worth it.

The schnitzel (any meat), potato pancakes and Black Forest cake are a personal favorite.

I always recommend Haus Murphy's to people looking for good food, and especially for those looking to try something a little different."}
{"text":"What an great place!

Great german food is very hard to find these days.  
Haus Murphys is a reminder of fantastic food gone bye. The paprika schnitzel is incredible, and the old standbys like sauerkraut and German potato salad and the red cabbage are all fantastic. Old style beer garden and wonderful beers from Germany are also available. 

This place has great food, lots of fun, and I love the music too. 

Oh, the sauerkraut chocolate cake is phenomenal, yes it sounds gross but it's not

I'm a big fan of Haus Murphys and you're in the area and want an authentic German meal, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Food is incredible and the German beer selection is terrific."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  It actually exceeded our expectations.  Each dish was full of unique flavors, everybody was very satisfied!  Prices were higher than I expected but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere - live polka music made me smile!!! The food was great. The chicken schnitzel with the white wine sauce was AMAZING. And the pretzel appetizer was delicious. This is definitely a great place to go to experience something unique and fun."}
{"text":"Just gotta say... OMG AMAZING... Ive never been disappointed eating here but tonight Jimmy and Justin went above and beyond typical servers. They made our experience at Haus Murphy so wonderful. Yall would have gotten 5 stars but your buser took my bfs daughters plate before she was done eating and tried taking his. Busers should NOT come to your table unless forks are down and the check is on the table. When i spoke to the manager Jersey about this she was dumbfounded. Apologized so many times for this poor service. Its ok... Between the food and Jersey, Jimmy, and Justin we will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Wow holy food Batman.  We are here for Octoberfest ! $10 cover but worth it.   The pretzel is off the hook !"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great space!!! LOVE THIS PLACE. Have been here for their October fests over the years (yes a must try!) and came here today to take my Dad and Uncle to lunch for Veterans Day. 1st off the service was great. Jimmie greeted us and got us a table outside. He promptly asked what we wanted for drinks- me and my Aunt decided to try the Ayinger Celebrator (bock beer) which yes if you like a dark beer it is a full bodied yummy beer. Next to order. Three orders of Original German Brat an order of Huhner (chicken) Schnitzel  and a side of the potato pancakes with apple sauce. The food came quickly and was piping hot and everyone raved about their meals! The portions are big enough that we all got to go boxes to bring home!  

I recommend Haus Murphy to anyone that enjoys good food and atmosphere. Side note. Year round they do 10% off the bill for veterans. On Veterans day they give a nice 15% off as thanks!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best German food I have ever had here in the States! All of the dishes were good and the deserts were great! 

Will be a future stop for us!"}
{"text":"We had a great time sitting on the patio enjoying appetizers and beverages (great beer selection). The ambiance brought my husband and I back to a beer garden in Germany. The band playing was festive and entertaining. Even my 3 year old had fun dancing and swaying with the crowd.

We will definitely be going back! BTW... if you order the pretzel be prepared to share. It's huge!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great German food. Anytime I'm in AZ we make a trip there. Guy Fieri thinks so too."}
{"text":"WoW...we'd never been to Haus Murphy's and boy did we have a blast!  We met our dining partners there, neither of which had even heard of the place.  Both being AZ natives and all...?  But at any rate the service was A+ the food was A++ and the Entertainment sublime.  Just what you would want from a German Restaurant.  Reminded us of the places we'd eat at in Chicago...!  
We had the appetizer 'Fladenbrot Pizza' what a great combination of flavors!  Then on the 'Brie en Croute'...another triumph! followed by their signature 'Giant Pretzel' and GIANT it was.
A couple of the diners had the \"Best\" seller, Jäger Schnitzel, one had the Steak Schnitzel, and I had the Nürnberger/Kassler (combo for one).  The consensus of the table was mine was THE BEST...although they all would have ordered their entree again for sure.!  The pork chop on my plate was perfection!  The bratwurst...well...just like I used to get in Wisconsin...oh the memories of Wisconsin.  Sorry to digress...!  
The meal, the service, the entertainment...well worth the drive from North Scottsdale.  I can't wait to do it again!"}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is a cool little spot in downtown Glendale.  I enjoy the little patio beer garden and the eclectic wait staff.  They have great brews on draft- and teamed with the outdoor seating option is pretty close to perfection in my mind.  

That being said, I have never ate any food item that someone deemed German that I actually loved.  I also do not eat anything made out of pig (so, your everyday sausage doesn't do it for me).  So, Haus Murphy's is cool and I'd go there if someone suggested it, but I personally haven't found a meal that works for me there.  I have tried the chicken with mushroom sauce and wasn't in love- just eh.  

I will, of course, give it several more tries because of proximity and the presence of a beer garden in hopes that I find a food item that does it for me."}
{"text":"Brie Appetizer was awesome, Pretzel was good, great stone ground mustard. Rouladens were a little dry, but fork tender. The red cabbage was too sweet for my taste, i like a little more vinegar bite, spatzel was ok. DDD hyped it up alot. Ive had better, but thats back in chicago."}
{"text":"Authentic German food for being in Arizona, great service had an enjoyable experience, will come again."}
{"text":"We were passing through town and checked Yelp and found this wonderful German restaurant. In addition to the delicious food, they have outstanding service. All the people we interacted with were genuinely interested in their jobs and had the owner mentality. We had the soup which was authentic and not laden with filler like flour or cornstarch. We had a variety of sausages with kraut and German potatoes. We also enjoyed a pre dinner salad which was exceptional. One really nice thing was that they waited for us to finish our salad before bringing the soup, then waited for us to finish the soup before bringing the main entre'. We will stop here again next time!"}
{"text":"Back again and still had great service great food and a good time salad was fresh soup with bountiful and meal was great"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since seeing it featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. I was anticipating a ton of flavors, and I had high hopes for this place because of all the great reviews. The Paprika Schnitzel was bland and a huge let down. The Potato rolls were bland too and tasted like mash potatoes that needed salt. The only thing that was good was the potatoes and the cabbage that came with the dish. They were my favorite part of the food. Overall, the food was not very impressive."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant! The atmosphere is great, the food is super delicious. However, I'm giving a 3 star rating due to a recent experience. 

I wanted the Beef Roulade, and I was asked if I wanted 1 or 2. I said 1, and went about eating my delicious pretzel. Then our (very nice) server came back and informed me that I cannot order 1, due to the way they are prepped and portioned, if I still want the Beef Roulade I must order 2 and pay the extra $4.95 for the second one. 

Of course I did because I really wanted it, however this is a horrible practice to enforce bad prep practices on customers. If you can't honestly offer them in singles, take it off the menu and sell them in pairs only. 

Also you put your server in an awkward situation which is really super uncool."}
{"text":"Great comfort food, from the Bavarian pretzel, bratwurst, schnitzel, pastas.  It's all made to order and delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, just awesome! Top notch beer selection.  Great staff. Beer garden is great setting."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and was looking for an authentic German restaurant for my mom who's from Germany. I stopped by on 7/6/16 to get something to go. She wanted Weiner schnitzel so I ordered that with sauerkraut instead of the German potatoes. 
When we opened the container at home, the sauerkraut had a very strong smell. The Weiner Schnitzel was a piece of veal breaded and fried- no flavor- none. Both the breading or the meat itself. The sauerkraut was very strong smelling and had a strong sour taste. The other side dish was a warm cabbage & cream dish. It Was passable. It also came with a soup, not sure what the name was, but it was a brown thickened beef flavor with a bit of onion. Kind if sweet & sour?? It was okay. I didn't care for the meal and my mom said she didn't either. She said the sauerkraut shouldn't be strong smelling or so sour tasting. 
As for the restaurant, it was empty, no patrons, but it was clean. I was greeted warmly as I walked in, but nothing after that. 
I will not return and maybe others love the food, but as you can see from my picture, it didn't even look appealing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give separate stars for food and service. This place was very busy when we walked in, as it was Glendale Glitters. We expected to wait for a table, but were pleased when we were seated immediately. We ordered the sampler for 2 and drinks. I also wanted a salad, and the sever told me it was $2, which seemed reasonable. Our drinks arrived, and we settled in to our outdoor seat. The German band was a nice touch, and the heaters kept us toasty. Our food arrived soon after we finished hubby's soup and my salad. As the food runner approached, time slowed down to slow motion. He almost slid the entire plate on my lap but, instead, he reached to balance the plate and knocked over my full soda. On my lap. On the cold patio. I was not angry about the spilled soda--I was a server forever, and these things happen. I could tell this kids was freaked out, and we felt bad for him. He grabbed some napkins, apologized profusely, and then almost took off when I asked him for a refill on soda. He brought me a refill, but left our table a complete mess. We cleaned up as much as we could, and covered the ice left on our table with a bunch of napkins. I was soaked and our table was trashed. Our server came over and brought more napkins, but did not clean up our table until prompted. Pretty strange. Also, we ordered a sampler type meal, and no one really told us what was what on the plate, so we didn't know what we were eating. The food was quite good. I can't really tell you what exactly it was, but it was a huge portion for us. 
  Our server also apologized but nothing else happened. If this would have happened when I was a server, I would have asked the manager to stop by the table and offer to at least buy dessert, if not the entire check. I was soaked; this wasn't a couple of drops. If you read my other reviews, I am not one to expect free food, but if there ever was a time, this was it. But, nothing was com'd. In fact, the side salad I ordered was $4 instead of $2."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic!  In historic Glendale, it truly stands out (in a good way).  They have amazing food, fun music, and a good selection of beer.  Remember though- a Liter of beer is definitely bigger than a Pint.  If you do forget, there's a park caty-corner for naps!"}
{"text":"Only place in the valley to go for German fare. I recommend the Jagerschnitzle."}
{"text":"First time here, this restaurant is comparable to some of the best German comfort food found at various places that I have been stationed in Germany. The potato pancakes served as an appetizer were correct, and some of the lightest that I have ever had. the mushroom soup was perfect, and the service was excellent and attentive.  This place is definitely worth a return"}
{"text":"Third visit on busy Thursday in March during spring training and NASCAR weekend. Five hungry guys who soon had liters of beer in their fists, including real German October fest brews. Stuffed asigo topped mushrooms are special. Snitzels and ramadle German quality. Very satisfying night with good friendly quick service. 

1/19/18 update: menu and beer selection have been reduced. Still a couple schnitzel choices but not house made, likely outsourced."}
{"text":"Okay food.  Wiener schnitzel lacked flavor, waiter  as  as he thought he was.  Portions are reasonable sized and prices are decent.   Lousy neighborhood with homeless in front of restaurant.   If you must have German food, this place will suffice."}
{"text":"What a fascinating place! I was here from out of town and was excited to have something I have never had before. None of the authentic menu items were things I had experienced. 

I had the Jager Schnitzel, which was delicious. We were there around 7:45 and they were out of chicken schnitzel and beef roulade. Arrive early to get the popular stuff!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on diners drive-ins and dives had to try it the paprika schnitzel was wonderful as was the stuffed mushrooms and potato pancakes four stars for that the beer gave you five"}
{"text":"I ordered the combo for one that consisted of a brined pan seared pork chop and 2 veal suasages. The food was good but slightly under seasoned for my taste. The pork was cooked perfectly, while the sausages were on the dry side and the German fried potatoes were a little under done. The potato salad however, was fantastic as was the sauerkraut!!!
The atmosphere is really warm and inviting with German decor all around and especially nice when added to the Christmas season. 
Staff was very friendly and the service was quick.
If given the opportunity I would gladly dine there again on my next visit, but would probably sample some of the other options on the menu...from what I heard from the other diners around me the Sauer Sauerbraten is to die for."}
{"text":"The service was great and the stuffed mushrooms were delicious. We both had the Paprika Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing (cabbage with cream sauce). The fried potatoes were great, everything else was ok. The meal was almost $50 without drinks, so it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"Great place for a brew in the outdoor biergarten. 

Food is pretty average. I did enjoy the sausage appetizer."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place when it was much smaller and located down the road.  The old location was a bit cozier however the restaurant still feels like an authentic German restaurant and the food is amazing.  This is one of my favorite places to take friends and family."}
{"text":"This place always amazes us.....always fabulous food, always friends attentive service and well worth the drive from Mesa.  There are 2 German restaurants in Mesa but neither are worthy of 2nd visits so we just make the drive and always are glad we did to get the best of the best at Haus Murphy.  Just love the outside area."}
{"text":"So simple... so authentic... just the type of place to make you feel like you're back in Germany --- that is, if you've ever been to Germany.  If you haven't, check this place out and you can pretty much save a trip over there.

It's hard to go wrong here.  The food is classic German --- sausages, kraut, schnitzels, etc.  Oh, and don't forget about the tall glasses of beer that you can drink in the beer garden!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly and helpful. If it wasn't a Sunday night I probably would have drank like 5 DAS BOOTs, just kidding they don't have those, but I would have had at least 2 or 3 MASS of beers. One thing everyone talks about in regards to this place is their GIANT pretzel which is very good. I am a big fan of the variety of food they have and the imported beers you really can't find anywhere else in the area. If you ever feel adventurous and a person that likes to try new things, I would highly recommend this place. I don't live in the area but if I did I would probably be here at least 2 or 3 times a week, the pretzel and Uber would be my best friends."}
{"text":"Really fun to get out of the boring norm in Peoria!  Not a chain and we liked it. The food was good, the atmosphere was entertaining and enjoyable. Not a fan of the German get-ups the girls were wearing (a little too literal and cheesy).  The restaurant could stand a little refreshing--but over all definitely worth it and we will go back.  Get ready for some meat and potatoes."}
{"text":"HUGE FOOD PORTIONS!!! Lots of different beer's on tap! Great cocktails! Love the atmosphere and the service is always great! You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Never been here before but seen lots of times while driving to my favorite comic book store, Drawn To Comics. I had the Sausage Sampler appetizer (2 brats with sauerkraut and sauces) for lunch, which was very tasty and filling.  Paired nicely with outdoor seating and a lager. Can't wait to try their dinner items in the future!"}
{"text":"This place makes me want to learn German every time i go.

I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week.

Great food, great prices, great atmosphere.

The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"This place is always a 4-5 star for me, but as of late, I'm worried they're slipping. Last time we went in, they had a seriously condensed menu that left off some of the items we always ordered. Namely, the stuffed cabbage -- something anyone with a eastern/central European family grew up with (and they did it really well). Super bummed about that. When we asked the server, he said they changed it for Glendale Glitters, and haven't changed it back since. I really hope the old menu makes a comeback, because there's maybe 15-20 options on this one, and there were more than double on the prior menu."}
{"text":"I came to this place on a Sunday exploring West Phoenix beer options (beyond the bud light crowd) and was not disappointed. We had pretzels and sausages in the bar where the bar tender was knowledgable about their beers and very helpful. On that trip, we bought tickets to Octoberfest here and brought our families in October. We had a blast!

The food is uniformly good and the beer comes in liters. It is like drinking from a fish bowl. Who wouldn't like that?!"}
{"text":"The German food here was absolutely amazing. Some of the best food in general I've had in Phoenix. The stuffed mushrooms are undescribable he good in the pork shank was incredibly tender and flavorful they clearly cook it the right way. Our server was super super kind and the service was fast. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing will ever be as good as my mother's cooking, but this will do. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She also checked in on us enough, but wasn't overly pushy. 
We had the sauerkraut puffs to start. I wouldn't say they were puffs, but they were delicious. They seemed more potato based and really heavy. I would still order these with the intention of taking them home for later. 
I had the roulade and it was very tender. Still not my mother's cooking, but it will do! The red cabbage to me, was missing something, but it wasn't enough to not eat it. For the life of me I can't remember what my husband ate. I just remember it being a \"spicy braut\", but not the one that was intended to be spicy. Perhaps the wonderful waitress that suggested it to us will do the same. 
For desert we had the apple strudel with real cream. It was delicious! You maybe thinking the portions were small, but they weren't. We ended up taking most of it home because there was so much food! I will add pictures."}
{"text":"Looking for something new instead of the boring places you usually go to? If so, then this is the place for you. Fun and lively, this place has a great atmosphere! The beer selection is fantastic and they have many specials that appeal to everyone.

Vegetarian? Don't worry, they have spaetzle and some great, huge pretzels.

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This wasn't a typical restaurant visit - we had a group of Toastmasters friends set up a meeting for 24 in the bar area, and we had a fixed menu for our group.  

What I liked - fun venue, lively energy (live accordion music playing on the patio!).  The beer (heifeweissen) was wonderful (holy cow - the large comes in a stein that I could hardly lift!!).  The sausages, sauerkraut and schnitzel was fabulous.  Desserts (cherry and apple strudel) were decent. 

They have a large bar area with TVs and lots of seating; an extended patio area and a front dining room that was a little quieter. 

The servers were a delight.  However - it was weird.  They knew that our group would be giving speeches and conducting a meeting.  But they put us in the high traffic area in the bar.  The manager even bumped into the speaker (who was forced to stand in the walkway) instead of walking around, and gave us a look like we were in her way. It was just too darn noisy to hear more than 10 feet away.  I grant that maybe we picked the wrong location for a meeting.  But then why didn't the manager (knowing we were coming and what we were doing) put us in that location?  

I'm sure this restaurant is a delight if you are just coming in for a fun German food experience. Although my hubby was disappointed about the mustard they provided. So I'm giving a 4 star rating for the experience that \"regular\" diners were having. 

This venue is across town from us - although I love the downtown Glendale vibe - I most likely won't make the long drive to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not bad but I have had much better.

Tried the combo plate with a sampling of various sausages, schnitzel, meatloaf and ham. The sausages and ham were the best part. Ham had a nice smoky flavor and was very tasty. 

They had a couple of dipping sauces including dijon mustard (from a bottle) and a curry ketchup that tasted like your bottled ketchup with curry powder. 

 Schnitzel was overcooked and dry and almost rubbery. Spatzel was watery and almost tasteless. Potatoes were very oily and not very flavorful. meatloaf was soft and spongy and packed with flavor but I have had much better.

Overall - the things that were done right - sausage and ham - were very good but the  things that were not done as well were more of a dissapointment."}
{"text":"Ok so I have to start with the fact that I love German food and everywhere I travel I search out German Restaurants. With that said I have been to every kind from good to bad to great. This place lands somewhere in between good and great. 


Atmosphere: it is really cute with old world charm. Think grandma's kitchen with plates and artwork on the wall. Kick knacks around. The dining chairs are comfortable. Sometimes restaurants have the uncomfortable kind so as to get you to leave sooner. 

Also because it was mentioned prior it was cool and there seemed to be no ac problems. 

Service: service was a 5 out of 5 attentive without being over bearing and friendly. 

Drink: I ordered and orange blossom and it was like an elevated screwdriver. Also an ice tea and it was good not old or bitter. 

Food: the thing everyone wants to know. I had the roulade with an extra side of German potato salad because I wanted to try it. Also It came with soup of the day a beef and barley. The soup was tasty and had a good broth. 

The roulade was really nice as was the spetzel and cabbage. I can say that the food was a 5 out of 5. The cabbage has a nice depth of flavor. The potato salad is served warm with a minimal amount of dressing. The roulade is spot on not dried out at all. Nothing was over seasoned. 

I also had to breakdown and have an apple dumpling. OMG I think I just got sent to pastry heaven."}
{"text":"Had one lunch while visiting the area and was surprized how mediocre the food was, considering some glowing reviews.
Goulasch soup was adequate, not great. No German bread with it, just a pack of soup crackers. Jaegerschnitzel was tough meat and had no taste, and the mushroom sauce on it tasted like it was premade brown sauce out of a can.  A giant chocolate cake slice was served with a glob of what was supposed to be cream, but it was not real cream (tasted like cool whip).
I never had anything this uninspiring in many years in Germany. Maybe I ordered the wrong things.

Service was friendly and attentive and seating was comfortable."}
{"text":"After a long cross country journey, this was our last stop on our way 
home. It ended up being the highlight of all the resturaunts. I had the saurbraten and absolutely loved it. Staff was great"}
{"text":"Went for Oktoberfest so this might be biased! Lived it. Huge beer check. German style seating, check, traditional German restaurant owner, check. Felt like my Mom's ( She is German but won't cook for me anymore)! Had Jagerschnitzel was delicious and tender. I used a plastic knife and fork so. Felt the real spirit of Germany inside and out. Our server was German so we ordered auf Deutsch. I'll be back to try the full menu but everyone in the group loved the traditional specials. Eisbein and schweinehaxe Warren lecker!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Not for the health food crowd, but definitely for people who do not mind pounded, fried meat and giant beer. They rotate between 4-5 soups and each are delicious and come with every dinner or you can opt to get a German salad for about $2.00 more.  It is impossible to leave this place still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"The service isn't very good sometimes, but we've never been disappointed with the food. We usually get the pretzel for an appetizer (delicious) and the chicken schnitzel for dinner. Some of the best German food I have ever had and the beer is great too!"}
{"text":"Although we have been here many time brought countless number of guest to enjoy this place, as of recently we have had bad experiences. 45 minute wait for an appetizer followed by 30 min wait for our dinner order. Food over cooked and chasing our waiter for water and coffee, forget a refill, you would have to get it yourself. The surrounding waiters will not attend to you. The manager will walk by numerous times and not acknowledge your waiting so long for each phase of the meal. Also if you get there for a late lunch beware! If you sit outside and your waiter gets transferred inside you are left without service. If you bring this to their attention most likely you will get no resolution. How unfortunately as we have introduced this place to many and are sorry for the loss of this once nice place to bring guest."}
{"text":"This is a quaint and cute place to eat authentic German food when the mood hits.  Really liked it overall.
Had the 6 sausages with sauerkraut and potatoes which was good--not fantastic--but good.  For dessert split two desserts with a friend which was apple struedel (the very best I have ever had) and the chocolate sauerkraut cake which was sooo chocolatey.  Loved the struedel most.
Tasted the giant pretzel which is good, but to me not worth the $8.95 which is kinda pricey for what it was.  I mean, really?  Flour and water and $8.95?
Regardless, if I ever crave in my entire lifetime German food this is where I will go.  
It's good, but there was a German restaurant in Houston that blows this place out of the water which I wish was duplicated here in Phoenix but isn't.
Overall, okay place...just the food didn't want to make me yodel at all."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town! Amazing food, great atmosphere and fun staff! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Here is why this gets the Five Starts:

1. Independently owned with the owners actually there working
2. Authentic German Food done VERY well
3. Amazing staff that understand the menu and doesn't make fun of you for pronouncing anything wrong.
4. LARGE outdoor bier garden in historic downtown Glendale
5. Das Boot - You can get a real German bier in a large Glass Boot.
6. Best from scratch pretzel you could ever dream of. 

The overall atmosphere is one that is just fun and very different from anything else I've found in the Valley."}
{"text":"First time tonight! WOW! Amazing food, atmosphere and they LOVE dogs! Pet Friendly. Awesome service. The owner brought out different sausages for my dog. The Chocolate Martini's were D'Lish and my husband LOVED his beer German Hef. We will for sure be back, our food was so yummy...from the appetizer brie to brats and my pork dish, wow. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. We live in the East Valley and this is our go to spot for Hubby's Birthday, and a few other times during the year when we just have to have German food. Having been to Germany a few times we know what the food should taste like, and Haus Murphy's definitely fixes our cravings!  Worth the Drive!!!"}
{"text":"HOLY MOUNTAIN OF FOOD! Fast service, extensive beer menu, great and pretty authentic german food. The pretzel is the largest I have ever seen. If your a fan of \"man food\" because that is what german food is, check out this place!"}
{"text":"We ate at Haus Murphy's about a year ago for the first time, and absolutely LOVED the food.  Everything we ordered was delicious, and it was a fun atmosphere.  We decided to eat here for Mother's Day this year, and were sorely disappointed by our experience and will likely never go back.

We made a reservation for 6pm and arrived about 5 minutes early with our entire party of 6 present.  We were seated almost immediately and ordered our food about 5-10 minutes later.  Our order included an Eisbein, combo plate for 2, and meatloaf, along with a giant pretzel as an appetizer.  45 minutes after we placed our order, we were served side salads, and a few minutes after that the waitress came to the table and apologized, saying that the Eisbein was sold out for the day and asked if we would like to order something else.  She assured us when we placed the order that they had some left, and she had reserved one for us, yet it took them 45 minutes to realize they couldn't even make one of our main dishes.  We placed an order for Paprika Schnizel instead.

By the time we finished the small side salads, we had been at the restaurant for almost an hour and our appetizer pretzel still hadn't even arrived.  We saw a waitress come out of the kitchen with a giant pretzel, relieved that we were finally receiving our appetizer, but the waitress put the pretzel down on the table next to us, who had arrived long after we had already placed our order.  When we asked the waitress why our pretzel still hadn't come out yet and the table of people who arrived after us already had theirs, she went back to \"ask the kitchen\" what had happened.

After several more minutes and no food in sight, we decided to leave and ate at our favorite Chinese Restaurant instead.  We were so pleased with our last visit that it is a shame the service was so horrendous.  I doubt we will ever be back.  There is no excuse for making us wait over an hour without even being served an appetizer."}
{"text":"A little chilly and spitting out last night in Glendale, but it was warm and dry in the outside eating area of Haus Murphy's.  I've hear about this place for years and anted to go there and decided to hit Glendale Glitters too.

 We shared their mushrooms, their spicy brat, and their Paprika Schnitzel. My girlfriend had a couple of glasses of their seasonal wine that was spiced and warmed. I had 2 liters of their \"Spaten Optimator - Double bock beer with a rich malty flavor and molasses undertones.\". 

The food was wonderful.  The service was excellent.  The music was entertaining. The beer was wonderful. It was a wonderful date night experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always amazing traditional German Food and all the beer choices leave you in wonder. My daughter and I always order the pretzel too which is fabulous! This is a must stop when you are in downtown Glendale!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Germany and my boyfriend's Oma would make rouladen. Most favorite German dish! I was super excited to enjoy it again and I wasn't disappointed with the rouladen other than the fact I was looking forward to the mini pickle in the middle that I thought was standard? Maybe it was just a family thing. I was not impressed at all with the spaetzle. It was flavorless. Could have used a visit to the sautee pan with some butter and spices. Definitely opt for the potatoes instead which are so flavorful and decadent! Potato pancakes were decent and the cherry struedel was very true to german bakery style. Service was just ok. I was bummed our server didn't go over specials because we overheard another server telling his table about them and they sounded delicious! Oh well. I'd say we'll try the specials next time but I rarely get in the mood for German food and its a bit pricy to be visited often."}
{"text":"My wife and I got a chance to come here on a saturday night. 
We sat on the patio and there was 2 guys playing music. Pretty loud.

We ordered a big azz pretzel that was great and my wife couldnt stop talking about it for days afterwards. It was the best pretzel ever.

They do take there time bringing out the food and getting the check, so plan on being there for awhile. 

We ordered a schnitzel, the swiss style one. Its kind of like a corden on bleu but with pork and it has some very suttle flavors, nothing over powers anything.

We would definitly go back and if you do go, make sure you get a pretzel"}
{"text":"Due to misunderstanding regarding our order, was given the opportunity to sample more items than expected: Bauernplatte combo for two.  I'm not usually a sausage fan, and have actually never eaten Bratwurst, but the German Bratwurst (pork) and Spicy Bratwurst (beef) were actually rich, smooth, and flavorful.  My husband enjoyed the Kassler Kotelett (pork chop), but neither of us were impressed with the Hackbraten (German meatloaf) or Schwabische Spatzle (noodles).  I have to admit, I've eaten a lot of sauerkraut in my life, and the stuff here is pretty darned good.  The German potato salad and fried potatoes were good as well.  The pork schnitzel was fine, but could use some additional seasoning.  Finally, we also tried the bread pudding, which was cold, and tasted more like unbaked bread dough than real bread pudding.  Outdoor patio is spacious and pleasant."}
{"text":"We stepped into the restaurant on a hot summer evening dressed in shorts and tank tops. The AC  made the front part of the restaurant too cold for us so they led us to the back(this place is huge!) where our server happened to be named AC...least I think that was his name, little Irish Italian guy who does a pretty legit pronunciation of German menu items. He was super hyper and enthusiastic about his love for the place. He expressed genuine love and admiration for the owners, and the business they built, and he totally made our night. 

Summer is the slow season in town as sweltering 100+degrees drive people away. It's a shame that this restaurant isn't always packed to the brim because it's located in a cute historic part of town within an old brick building and it has so much character.

The former business, which was an old soda/pharmacy/ice cream shop, was named Murphy's. As an homage to the former business the German owners, when they took over the location named their restaurant Haus Murphy's and thus we get a German/Irish hybrid named restaurant that causes a bit of disgruntled murmurs with German/Irish patrons. Descendants ask is this a German restaurant or an Irish restaurant? 

This is a 100% authentic German restaurant. Once a year they reconcile the controversy with their name by making and serving amazing corned beef during St. Patty's day, and you can wash it down with one of the in house German beers. No Guiness! They stick to their roots here which is what I like. They know where and when to compromise with their food, and I'm glad they are stubborn about keeping the establishment as close to their German heritage as possible. 

Sauerbraten was what we ordered. It was one of the dishes featured on Diners and Drive in and was labeled on the menu with a little icon to indicate that. The meat is marinated in spices for many days to achieve it's smoky clove scented flavor. It was really a delicious sauce which I tried to
sop up every inch of. I also loved the spaetzl noodles. They were delicious as the noodles in chicken noodle soup, and they were equally as tasty on their own as a side which I used to sop up the sauerbraten sauce.

We finished with a slice of the sauerkraut chocolate cake. You couldn't taste the sauerkraut one bit and the cake disappointed us. The cake wasn't as moist as we would've liked and instead all the moistness came from the dense and intense chocolate frosting. 

Overall a great experience, albeit a bit on the spendy side. The Sauerbraten dish was priced at $19. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the hype! We've been talking about going to Haus Murhpy's for a long time and finally made it a couple weeks ago with another couple we are friends with.  Appetizers were big enough to share, the entree's were HUGE.  Food was amazing, prices even better...service was excellent. Outdoor patio was a great surprise - will make for an awesome place to hang out on nice days.  I cannot wait to go back!  YOU HAVE TO Try the Schnitzel!!!"}
{"text":"We live in Queen Creek,  but were at Gila River arena for an afternoon concert, and were looking forward to having dinner afterward at Haus Murphy's,  as it's been years since we were there.  It was around 6pm when we arrived and were seated out on the patio (6 in our party).  Although it was chilly out that night,  they have many outdoor heaters which made dining outside quite comfortable.   The patio area was comfortable, but there were a few tables that were pretty loud, so the atmosphere felt more like a college bar hangout vs a family friendly environment.  When ordering drinks,  my husband and I found they were out of our first choice so we settled on something else.   For dinner,  it was jager schnitzel, soft pretzel with cheese spread for the table, and I ordered the patato pancakes as my meal.  There were 4 others in our party and they ordered bolognese, and more jager snitzels.  Expect to enjoy a beverage or two before your meal arrives.   Or in my case, doesn't arrive.  We were served, minus the pretzel and the potato pancakes.  Eventually,  the pc's arrived, but without sour cream since they were out of it,  but didn't mention it when I ordered.    And the pretzel made it,  but no cheese spread- no explanation. The others in my party were underwhelmed with the flavors of the jager snitzel.  In observing the bill,  we found we were over charged for one of our beers, which was promptly corrected, and we weren't charged for the pretzel and the potato pancakes.  We didn't ask for it to be comped,  so it was nice that they took care of it."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time eating at Haus Murphy's. My husband and I went to celebrate my birthday. It was delicious! Very authentic! Great atmosphere on the patio with great music. We couldn't decide what to eat so chose to share the platter for two (which is enough for 3-4). The pretzel for an appetizer was also excellent! Wish we would have saved room for dessert - next time!"}
{"text":"I love Haus Murphy's! I live less than 2 miles away from the restaurant, and its definitely my favorite restaurant in AZ! The food is delicious, and the sauerkraut chocolate cake is a must have; can't go to the restaurant without getting it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the menu, food and service.  It has a nice authentic feel.  They have a nice patio too."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is great. Oktoberfest is always a blast. The pretzel is great with the house made mustard, the strudel is awesome as well."}
{"text":"German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Went earlier this week (mid-week) during Glendale Glitters, where they are busy but the food was no good. Because of the larger crowds they have a shortened menu (which is a bad thing to begin with, but I get it). The quality of the food has terrible, though (which is inexcusable): my wife's cabbage role was cold inside (fresh out of the freezer, perhaps?) and my sausages were just plain awful (who sells Nürnberger sausages that are spicy???).
Maybe they are just trying to make a quick buck from the crowds that probably won't be back anytime soon, but they are not doing themselves any favors. I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, attentive service, and live music \"Haus Band\" on Friday and Saturday nights.  A great place for large groups, birthdays, and nice outdoor seating for any night.  Authentic German food as far as I am concerned...same with their beer."}
{"text":"I go here several times a year and absolutely love this place!  The pretzels, red cabbage, spaetzle, sauerkraut, schnitzel, you name it-and it is excellent here!  Oktoberfest is always a good time.  The staff is great.  My favorite dinner dish is the jäger schnitzel and my favorite lunch sandwich is the Reuben-best Reuben I've ever had.  They have a couple different German potato salads-both very good!  This place is a must try if you are near downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"You people that gave it a low rating, you have all wrong.  I've eaten at Haus Murphy's twice.  I've been to Germany......blah blah, etc.  It's a fine food establishment!  Downside......I ate tooooo much.  No regrets here!"}
{"text":"My parents forced me to come here while they were visiting from NY. I was reluctant to come because I'm not a super big fan of German food.  However, this place may have changed my mind. Lets start with beer. Yes, beer. German, imported, deliciously large beer. They sell beer by the litre for about $11. Yes, that's right, 11 bucks. For a liter of good German beer!
Appetizers:  We got potato pancakes that were excellent! We were all fighting over them.  Good thing it was a large portion (good to share between 2-3 people).  
Mom and dad got some variety of schnitzel.  They have like 20 different kinds, so I can't remember. It came with homemade spaetzle that was awesome!
I got the home made bolognese. I can't pass up good home made pasta sauce. It was amazing. So worth it!  
We ordered a few desserts to go (it is family dinner after all) and all were good- the favorite was the sauerkraut cake. Sounds gross, but it was awesome. 
Definitely a must if you're in Glendale! They have an awesome patio/\"beer garden\" if you have a while to stay and hang out.  The service was excellent and the owners were just so lovely.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Megan & Jeremy have been amazing!!! The service was beyond perfect!!! I love this place, our first time here but definitely not our last time here. I'd definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good find! Food interesting! Would come back with a bigger crowd so I could sample more variety! Reny was attentive however a waitress at the front was complaining about work schedule loud enough for customers to hear full conversation!"}
{"text":"Seriously get a german pretzel with mustard and a weihenstephaner hefe weissbier.
It's a match made in heaven. 
Best beer and pretzel combo I've ever had."}
{"text":"Lucy is an amazing waitress! She was so kind and wonderful during Oktoberfest! We were so impressed by her, she made the experience so enjoyable for us."}
{"text":"10/01

Had dinner with a group of yelp friends.  Thanks to Jim W. for organizing yet another fun event!  The weather was perfect and made for a relaxing dinner out in the patio.  

For dinner, I ordered the Krakauer Wurst, a spicy beef and pork sausage with a crispy sausage casing (\"spicy\" and \"crispy\" were the keywords in my choosing this dish!) platter, which included German fried potatoes, sauerkraut, and a bowl of chicken and cabbage soup ($9.95).  I would order this dish again!  Loved the spiciness and textures of the sausage (would I be able to enjoy trying out the other non-spicy dishes if I decide not to order the Krakauer on my next visit??), and the fried potatoes were very good- of course, I only ate the crispiest of the bunch.  I've been avoiding cabbage for many months now, but after sampling a taste of it tonight, I had to have more :)  I didn't taste the soup- that came home with me for my roomie to enjoy- but a few others received it with their meals, and the aroma was intoxicating!  BTW, I was also handed some horseradish on the side as part of the platter, but the sausage was spicy enough that I didn't need it.

For dessert, I ordered a slice of the German chocolate cake ($6.95?)- four layers of cake iced with homemade whip cream, cherry jam with cherries, and almond slivers coating one side.  A dollop of fresh whip cream placed beside it just added a little more sweetness to this lovely meal's end.  I would also order this confection again =)

I almost forgot!  Haus Murphy was gracious enough to offer two complimentary pretzels for the table.  While I had only a couple of small twists, I really enjoyed them!  I will surely order this on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Schnitzel, Spatzle, and Pretzel oh my! Did I mention beer too? 
These are just a few of the reasons I love (and you will too) Haus Murphy's. Set in Old Town Glendale one may not think to look for this gem. 
I recommend the Jager Schnitzel: Mushrooms in brown gravy with a delightful piece of fried pork....hungry yet? 
My husband swears by the sausages, and beer served here. I agree with him on the beer...You are allotted a GIANT beer (if so desired, and frankly who wouldn't desire this?) with lovely flavor. 
The staff is friendly and helpful. Check this one out! Zer Goot!"}
{"text":"Haus Murphy serves up a quintessential German experience. An authentic feeling enviroment with a selection of foods that not only a native could love, but anyone willing to step into a Black Forest story book will find tasty.  Despite it's Central Glendale location the place wasn't heavily patronized on our Friday night visit, still we had called ahead as suggested and set a reservation time. We were seated immediately, but were forgotten for almost a half hour. I  didn't realize how long we were sitting until my partner pulled out the cell phone to check. I was looking over the decor and commenting on the trinkets and chatting.When our server came to take our order they were profusely sorry and immediately put a large bread pudding on our food list, either to take home or eat at the end of our meal, whichever we wanted as an apology. 

From that moment on there wasn't a lack of attentiveness at all. The first two things that came were a Filet Salad and a Sausage appetizer. The salad was divine! Here is the description straight from their menu: 
\"Slices of Filet Mignon, Radish Sprouts, Marinated Artichokes, Asparagus, Green Olives, Roasted Red Peppers, fresh Spring Mix, tossed in Lavender Vinaigrette, topped with quenelle of Herbed Goat Cheese....\"  That's right, drift off with me....to that lovely description. The Olives were not oily, they were fat, plump, martini olives. The Filet was perfect.  A Lavender Vinaigrette? It was a WOW. But it's a limited time salad, so it may not be there when you visit.

Then came the sausage sampler. You no longer can choose the sausages you sample like the online menu states, and you get saurkraut not german fried potatoes, but it was still nice. They set a bottled mustard you can buy in any grocery store on the table.  I think it  would have been nice to have some sampling of german mustards for dipping. It was at this point that I noticed we didn't have a bread basket. I had read about Rye and Pumpernickle with a tapenade that comes at the beginning, so I inquired. Unfortunately this was a cost loser for the restaurant and they no longer do it. Instead they brought out three basic dinner rolls with the tapenade instead. This change dissapointed me as it's rare to get hearty breads and the tapenade doesn't go well on a basic dinner roll, they should just bring out some butter.

On to the dinners. It was so very hard to choose among the Schnitzles and Sausages, but we managed. One Nurn-burger Combo and a Schweizer Schnitzle later with a side of potatoe dumpling and we were quite sure we'd ordered plenty of food. The Tomato soup which prefaced our entree's was better than I expected. Neither of us like Tomato soup and both of us liked this one. I'd skip the potato dumpling side in the future it was a gooey mass of starch,  maybe we should have tried the Spaetzle instead. 

The Schnitzle was really good and the sausages juicy. I think I could try a different schnitzle each visit and be pleased. I also might consider just a sausage and a bun. They will bring a roll for your sausage if you ask. The Wirsing was very tasty, I had read it wasn't so good, but I was thrilled with it. In the end we were quite full, we had ordered some drinks and had forgotten the large promised bread pudding. It arrived and we ate what we could handle while the Tuba and Accordian duo played their way through the restaurant. 

A bit spendy, we hit $80 for the two of us, but we weren't trying to eat cheap. Careful planning could lower the cost. All in all it was quite festive and fun for an evening and we are glad we went. You should visit!"}
{"text":"Authentic live music Fridays and Saturday's 6-8! Make such a fun atmosphere with even better food!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while driving to the Chocolate Festival. My husband was thrilled as he LOVES German food. We decided to have lunch here after checking out the festival.

Being a lovely warm and sunny day we decided to sit outside....which is very cool...nicely decorated, big picnic tables and plenty of sunlight.

I ordered the Hackbraten (German Meatloaf) which was very good, the mashed potato and red cabbage were superb! With this I of course had to try a German beer.....I asked the waiter what he would recommend, he asked what type of beer I like and I said usually the darker ones...he recommended the Franziskaner Dunkel - an unfiltered dark wheat beer, dark roasted malt with a smoky roasted grain finish .... a great recommendation as it was just perfect with my meal.

My husband who is constantly craving Weisswurst Sausages was finally at peace having found it on the menu. He insisted I try some of his and said it would melt in my mouth....wow!...it actually does melt in your mouth....delicious. 

Our waiter was awesome as he knew everything on the menu so he was very helpful as well as very friendly and a great photographer! Everything you need in a waiter : )

The German music playing in the background was really festive and added to the great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good German food at a great price.  Service to go with it too.  Can't go wrong here.

Baked Brie with lingonberries for an app!  Too good to pass up.  

We both got sausages and split them to share.  Happy with both.  And the potatoes and craut were pretty good too.

So then, why only 4 stars and not 5?  I don't know, just didn't seem like a 5 star review and there is no 4.5 option.

So if you want some good German grinds, with some beer or wine to go with, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We called in for a reservation this past Monday, which I am grateful we did because they were packed! We sat on the patio and were very comfortable under the heat lamps. We were in a group of 6 so we started with a giant pretzel and bread assortment, both which were very good. One of the people in our party ordered the potato pancakes, unfortunately they were out of sour cream so she was overall disappointed with her meal. My parents both ordered the Jager Schnitzel, my mom enjoyed hers and my dad was not very impressed. My fiance ordered the Kilometer german sausage and really enjoyed his dish. He generally does not care for sauerkraut but really liked it! I ordered the Haus Made Bolognese and really enjoyed the fresh flavors. Our service was a little slow, which is not surprising with how busy they were. I would have given them an additional star if we were able to get refills without having to flag someone down or wait a long time. I would probably go back to Haus Murphy's based on the food experience alone."}
{"text":"Now, THIS is how to run a restaurant. Seriously, I'm NOT being sarcastic. I ordered an Ultimate Reuben, and it arrived cold, nearly ten minutes after every one else at our table was served! Must have been forgotten in the kitchen. The server took it back to have it reheated in the oven. 

Five minutes later, I tried it (four bites), and it was rubbery because of being reheated, gristly, and sliced too thick. I wasn't charged for the sandwich and was given a take-out slice of strudel for free. Not a great experience, but this is an example of how a restaurant should TRY to make things right!!! Sometimes, stuff happens.

The four stars are because I've been here before and have loved the food. 

The Jager Schnitzel is to-die-for. Should have ordered THAT tonight!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here again with German friends from out of town. Food was excellent as it was every other time we dinned here. Authentic German food prepared fresh. Excellent service too. Very crowded with it being the holidays and we only waited 25 minutes for a table for four with no reservation. Went to the bar for drinks while we waited and chatted with the friendly bar keep. Had a great time."}
{"text":"This place is really good, lots better than our German place back in Lexington, KY but we are still debating whether it is better than Bayrischer Hof in Cabarete or the Hofbrauhaus in Newport, Kentucky. Either way it's in the same vicinity.(quality wise, obviously as far a way from each other as I have ever traveled)
 
Started with the huge pretzel which was very warm and fresh. The cheese was pretty good and the horseradish mustard was great.
 
The beer was really good and toof bustin cold! See previous review if you need a translation!

By this time we backtracked on our original plan of ordering two entrees and decided to split one and add a side of the potatoe pancakes.
 
We ordered the Guy Fieri recommended Paprika Schnitzel and it did not disappoint! Great flavor and was thicker than your usual schnitzel. It did have a sweet flavor as mentioned by a fellow Yelper but it went really well. We loved it. The potatoe pancakes were absolutely amazing. We ordered a side of there mushroom gravy for comparative purposes and it was amazing. I thought it was the best we had ever had but my wife still favors the mushroom gravy at Bayrischer Hof In Cabarete Dominican Republic (a must try hole in the wall if in Cabarete)

As to the service, probably why I didn't go with a five star. By no means was the service bad but it was a little slow and the waiter was really busy and running from table to table so he was not very friendly. He wasn't rude either just kind of indifferent. No one there was really overly friendly but they were busy. To be clear they were not rude at all. We may have higher expectations of our staff when we eat out. There seemed to be a going through the motion attitude at several places we visited in Arizona. There seems to be more willingness to be genuinely friendly back home. This may not be a fair representation of Arizona since we were only here a short amount of time but it was our impression.  We certainly have experienced the same back home but just not as a usual thing.

Overall, don't let the service deter your visit. We are anxious to return to try more menu items- next time in AZ we will return!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while, and I was surprised to see I've never left a review.  Well, that is going to be remedied tonight!

Hubby and I love coming here, we both adore their schnitzel...he likes the chicken and I like the jager (pork loin).  It's always on point, and feels like someone's nana is in the back making each dish that comes out.  We were both commenting on that tonight, it seems so homey and comforting whenever we eat here.

We normally order the pretzel for an appetizer, which comes out fresh and hot (and HUGE) along with a beer cheese dip and spicy mustard dip...so delish!  We didn't get that tonight, just our entrees.  But, the entrees include a cup of soup, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

We did decide to share a dessert (which we don't normally do), and went with the apple streudel.  It's served with a vanilla sauce, ice cream and whipped cream.  The plate was completely empty when we were done.

The service was really good, our server was very friendly and we both enjoyed our dining journey to Germany...until next time..."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  the food is German home cookin'.  Make sure you get there when the Oompah band is playing.  Beer is great, food is great, and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Not really a beer garden, or at least not like the ones I'm used to. It was my first time having a Schnitzel so I thought it was pretty good. They didn't have that many beer on tap and what they did have was just okay. 

FYI we heard that the Restaurant Stakeout (or whatever the show was called) was all staged... bummer."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to visit if you are looking for some hearty food and good beer! Fun outdoor seating and good German cuisine. My husband and I have gone here quite a few times and always have a good experience!"}
{"text":"The oompa band was a blast!  I visited last night and enjoyed the place! Went early before the Glendale lights and a local theater performance. Sat at the bar where I enjoyed a bit of German Suds. We had the stuffed mushroom appetizer and probably would not have that again. Broiled shrooms w really good Italian sausage stuffing. The combo of the melted Parmesan and then the balsamic vinegar just had too many tastes going on for us. The soup was a very good pork and apple!! We loved it! We shared the pork shank w sauerkraut and German fried potatoes. Very nice. The Tuba player from the oompah band was engaging and they played for us at the bar. We had a blast and would definitely return."}
{"text":"If you like big German style, then this is the place for you.

All the classic meals, friendly wait staff, and you can get your beer in a fish tank."}
{"text":"Went to Haus Murphy's on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. This was our first visit so we took our exchange students from Germany with us. We drove all the way from Queen Creek (about an hour) They were very excited about an authentic German meal. They shared the $35.00 \"variety\" platter to share and I had the Saur Bratten. The food was sub-par and luke warm. The meats were tough and chewy and the schnitzel was over cooked. When one of the German boys asked for ketchup the waitress asked \"what are you going to ruin with that?\" She then tried to tell them \"That's not what they put on schnitzel in Germany\"  and proceeded to almost argue with them about it.  I felt this place was overpriced and the service was horrible! I will not be driving back again."}
{"text":"Uber German place! I love it!! The food is amazing and the beers are huge!! I got the kilometer but have tried a bunch of different dishes. All have been the best I have had in the Valley!"}
{"text":"We decided to grab a bite to eat while at Glendale Glitters, luckily it was a week before it closed so it was on the slow side.  This place always is packed when we walk by, especially the patio!  We got a table on the patio by a heater cause it was chilly  that night.  Ordered the lightest beer they had and it was great!  Ordered the brie cheese and sausage appetizers and they were delish!!!  What a great place...we heard it was on Diners, drive-ins and dives and glad we finally stopped!  Check them out..."}
{"text":"I was out in Glendale for a graduation event and my friend, who was driving, was originally from Germany so I recommended we try out this place. I have to say, love the location in old town Glendale and rather charming decor with waitresses dressed in traditional German garb like you would see at an Octoberfest in Munich, which occurs in September, not October, but whatever. 

As for the food, a bit off from what I've had in Germany - their Schnitzel here came across more like a chicken fried steak and the crust was not as crispy as I've had in Germany (I'm not from there but have visited several times). The one thing I did notice, and I appreciate the German beers on tap, was that the beer tasted just a bit off, and generally that is an indication that the establishment just needs to clean and sanitize their lines for their taps. I'm a home brewer so I may be more picky about this than most but I had my friend try the beer and she noticed the difference as well. 

We also had the apple strudel for desert and it was okay - part of the overall German meal experience. For me, charming place, a unique food experience but relative to the prices point I wouldn't say it was the best German meal experience I've had in Phoenix but it was till fun. All I ask, flush out those taps but I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area. :-)"}
{"text":"I would probably give this 4 1/2 stars may be even five.  This place is fantastic.  For those who have traveled to Germany - this is the place to go that will bring back all your favorite memories.  First I have to give them kudos for having authentic German beer (my favorite is about 4th or 5th, a wheat beer that is a little darker than a hefenweizen).  Both times I have gone we had the potato pancakes - these are a bite of greatness.  Also the schnitzel is wonderful, I recommend the Paprika schnitzel.  Dessert - bread pudding is delicious!! I would highly recommend this place.   Specially to people who can appreciate German food, beer, and flavors."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. 

I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. 

We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a \"sampler\", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. 

The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. 

For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! 

No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. 

I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). 

The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. 

Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.

I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. 

To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: \"That big ass pretzel made me thirsty\"!  

Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.

Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at."}
{"text":"This place has great German food and beer. Dining inside is okay, but in the cooler months the patio outside is the place to be. I have been here several times and they have never messed up my order, the food is good and the staff is nice. Closest thing to German food, short of being in Germany!"}
{"text":"This is not really a fair review. I'm reviewing this like I would if this place had been in Germany - but it's Phoenix, and I acknowledge that, so I'm bumping it up one star. Honestly, the food wouldn't have passed muster in Germany.
The \"famous sauerbraten\" was gray and chewy. The cabbage was good, the spatzel was OK - though I'm more partial to the grated spatzel. The bread dumpling didn't really have anything going for it. This, after tip, was $28?
I didn't hear any German (other than the piped in polka songs), or see anything of modern Germany, just uncomfortable servers in complicated uniforms. With plastic tablecloths.
I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience for this place, which is too bad. I've been searching for a German place in Arizona that works for me for years now.

Sigh. Maybe their schnitzel is better?"}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Haus Murphy's. Consistently good food and service. Fun atmosphere and staff. I prefer the goulash, which is rich and meaty. The red cabbage is tasty and sweet. The beers are strong and cold. I often visit with my German adopted-grandfather and he converses with one of the waiters fluently and it always has hilarious results."}
{"text":"If your ever in there get Alex. Guaranteed not to let you down. Friendly, service was absolutely fantastic and the food was real good. Price is competitive and delicious. I never give 5's as a score but the waiter deserved it"}
{"text":"Before reaching the entrance we could hear the delightful Bavarian Oompah band. The restaurant had a big crowd. We had a 6:30 reservation and were immediately seated outdoors on the patio as requested. The patio provides an authentic German beirgarten environment including the  band. Our waitress was excellent and provided pleasant and attentive service from beginning to end. We had the sampler platter for two which is pictured on their website and which was, of course, is very German. Also loved the dark German beer and dessert.  We came for the German experience and food and Haus Murphy knows how to provide it big time."}
{"text":"Deliciousness 3.5/5
Happiness 4.5/5

I enjoyed this place far more than I anticipated. It is a very pork-heavy menu (which I don't eat), but the beef sausage and chicken schnitzel were good. What were really outstanding were the garlic soup (I even ordered an extra bowl... in 100 degree heat!) and giant pretzels (a seasonal offering. Too bad since it was one of the best pretzels I've ever had). 

But let's be honest, you come here for the beer. It's expensive, but it's the real McCoy (or, because it is a German restaurant, the real Uter? Yay Simpsons!). Plenty of German ale selections I hadn't even heard it. Yes, they had a beer boot. No, I was not able to chug it all at once despite my best efforts. The drinks are delicious, especially when enjoyed in their outdoor patio. 

This is a pretty unique place with some very authentic German food and beer. Definitely nice for a change to the fare offered by most restaurants."}
{"text":"Great patio for an afternoon lunch.  We took our dogs and the wait staff was very nice to them, they bought a large bowl of water right away and made sure we had plenty of shade.

The food was great, We started with stuffed mushrooms, the sausage stuffing in them was terrific and we really enjoyed them, I had the Sauerbraten and my husband had the Paprika Schnitzel for our entrees. Both were flavorful and tasty and the portions were quite large. We did manage to save enough room to split a dessert and had the bread pudding, it was delicious.

Can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"went there for sunday dinner before Sunday nite Packer game.  our party of 4 sat out in the biergarten for beer and appetizers - had the pretzel and haus cheese with 4 rolls. we ordered too much bready but it was good.   the staff was accommodating when we asked nicely to move indoors for our entrees, due to flies coming out wanting our appies.  we ordered 3 different dinners and shared which was plenty of food after appies and soup.  enjoyed a schnitzel, sauerbraten (a little chewy/dry)  and Hungarian wurst (lots of great flavor).  mostly loved the dumpling and spaetzle and blaukraut and wirsing (creamed sauerkraut).  overall it's fun to go to a german place in Arizona with waitresses in dirndls and we had good enough food and service."}
{"text":"First of all I want to make sure to mention that the service was fantastic and that I could not have asked for a more polite and professional service.
Haus Murphy's food is okay at best and honestly I would not choose to return for dinner or lunch. I ordered the cheese-spread as an appetizer and the rye-bread that came with it was dry and old. 
The Jaegerschnitzel and the fried postatoes were okay, but the corn chowder was absolutely terrible. 
If you are looking for a fun place to have a beer, this would be a good place to go, but dinner or lunch I would not recommend at Murphy's Haus."}
{"text":"While I'm a fan of downtown Glendale I think this place fares a little above average in my book.  I'd put it between 3 to 4 stars but not near the upper half of that range.  I've been here several times and I feel like I'm trying to like the place during each visit.  I don't think that is a great sign, some places I can walk into and already know that the restaurant is a hit.

Things I did like was the nice looking decor, homey feeling, and the beer choices.  I also like the location smack dab in the middle of downtown and it's right across the street from an American Recovery project that is sprucing up an alleyway to make the area more appealing to pedestrians.  I'd like to see what this looks like when the project is finished.

Things I didn't like was the food, which is nothing to brag about.  The flavors are ok, but nothing to make me say wow that was a great meal.  Another thing, I know the place is supposed to look old, but it's on the verge of looking run down and dirty.  A little extra cleaning and maybe a few upgrades would change this opinion of mine.

Haus Murphy is still a great choice for experiencing a German restaurant here in the valley.  This place has much more potential to be a complete hit."}
{"text":"Holy crap! The best German Food in the state of Arizona, possibly the southwest region. Authentic food, beer and dessert. Located in beautiful downtown Glendale this restaurant has indoor and outdoor space, delicious spells wafting through the air."}
{"text":"Such good German food! The platter for two was such a great choice. The sausages were bomb and the schnitzel super crisp and golden. I definitely recommend taking the pretzel to go cold and heating it up at home. Such a tasty snack after. Will definitely be hitting this spot up again when we are back in Phoenix"}
{"text":"First time having German food, so I'm not the best judge on authenticity. But I thought it was okay. I came here twice. The first time I came was about 5 years ago. I had the Combo for One and I enjoyed it. Second time I had a Schnitzel, which I thought was just okay and not as satisfying as it sounded. The service the second time lacked and weren't very attentive. Will I go back for a 3rd time? Probably not."}
{"text":"The best service ask for \"Ryan's\" table. Food is fantastic!! Best price for the amount of food! Bring an appetite and a feel for a good Polka! 
I urge everyone to visit here when in town for Oktoberfest, Beerfest, or after Spring Training."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the server was friendly and attentive, it was a good value.  We were there on a Saturday evening.  It was noisy and the food was very slow coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Talk about a turn for the worse. Tonight I had the most awful service of my several years of going to Haus Murphy on a regular (at least once a month!) basis. If you read my previous review, you'll see how happy I was up until this point, but that's changed after tonight. 

What happened? First the service was slow. Then the service became nonexistent. Were they busy? Not more than normal. Was our server overburdened? Not that I could tell. She was, however, absent minded and uncaring. 

Example? Our server brings our drinks and wanders off to other tables, not even asking (or caring, apparently) if we were ready to order at that point, which we of course were. Just plops down the drinks and leaves without a word. What the heck is that? 

My wife wants to substitute French fries for the potatoes, which she doesn't care for. We've done this a hundred times before, never ever been a problem. But tonight, with this server? \"Oh there are no substitutions. It's printed on the menu here...\" and she proceeds to point it out to my wife, even though I've just told her we have never had an issue getting it substituted and that we're long time repeat customers. Totally over her head. So she says to my wife, \"Is it okay if they put it on the side?\" referring to the fries. Of course, why wouldn't it be? 

So we get our food, fries come as a side order and there was no substitution. Our server later shows up when we're more than half done with our meal and asks if we want refills. I say yes, so she takes both of our drinks and walks off. She never returned with them. About 15 minutes later, after we're both finished eating, she comes by and has the unbelievable nerve to ask how everything is going, oblivious to the fact that there are no drinks on the table at all. I told her, bluntly, that it would have been much better if she'd brought our drinks back before we finished the food. \"Oh, sorry,\" is her only response. She brings the drinks in 10 seconds flat, no follow up apology, no nothing. 

Another long delay, then I get the bill. Naturally they charged us extra for the fries rather than substituting. Mind you, she never told me that they would do that. Incensed, I go to the front to complain to a manager. I speak with a manager up there. I explain to said manager about the situation, to which she rudely and flatly responds, \"Yeah that's right, there's no substitutions,\" and gives me this stare like I was babbling nonsense or something. I point out that I was not told we would be charged so she has the server come over and tell me, \"No, I told you, remember? I asked if you were okay having it on the side.\" What?! That's not the same as asking if you can charge me extra. I tell her this, to which she responds, bluntly, \"Well, that's what I meant.\" 

I paid the bill and left without giving her any tip at all. I really, really hate to do that, but if you're going to insult my wife's intelligence, take our drinks and not bring them back until we're done eating and then have the gall to refuse removal of a charge you did not tell me about, you're dreaming if you think you're getting a tip. 

I cannot begin to put into words just how upset this whole thing has made me. I loved this place, as is obvious from the earlier version of this review. The thought of never going back makes me sick, but so does the way my wife and I got treated tonight. I'm not going back until I get some kind of explanation and an apology from the server and the manager. I did give one of the owners a complete run down of what happened and I'm hoping something will come out of that. Will definitely update this review accordingly as that progresses, but right now they are getting the 1-star they deserve."}
{"text":"Its not often that I make my way to the West Valley,  but I was excited to make my way to Haus to indulge in some hearty German food.  My boyfriend and I made our way over for a family members birthday,  and we're instantly charmed with the decor. There were flags from several nations hanging in the patio area,  and a giant pretzel statue that said get ready to lose that top button of your jeans. 
We had a large group of people but the service was extremely friendly and responsive. Clearing plates and checking in on us often; which is nice when you have several avid beer drinkers in the group. The beer list was impressive,  and offered 32oz Steins for drafts. enjoyed a full bodied Hefeweizen. 
We ordered Bavarian Pretzels and the Brie platter for starters.  The pretzels were wonderful! Definitely the gem of the restaurant.  Warm,  soft,  and the perfect amount of salt.  Yumm!  The brie dish was a little boring. They got the right melted consistency,  but there was no bread or really anything to pair it with, and the sauce didn't win me over either. For dinner I ordered the Kilometer which was 3ft of beef sausage. The sausage was spicy and had a lovely smoky after taste,  but it was a little overcooked reminiscent to a Slim Jim.  I heard similar sentiments from two others about the meat being dry.  It was great to see a big helping of Kraut on my plate,  but the side of potatoes were a bit too greasy and bland for my liking. 
The meats are usually the headliner in a German restaurant and Haus Murphys were a little underwhelming. The food overall was a little bland for the price point ($14-$19 a plate). Come to Haus if you're looking for a damn good beer and a pretzel combo though."}
{"text":"This is the best real German food in the valley.  It gets super crowded so we come here early.  The owner is the nicest lady!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few years ago with some friends, and I thought the food was mediocre at best. I've lived in Germany, so I know good German food. This wasn't it. Desperate for a taste of Germany, though, my husband and I looked up the menu online a few nights ago and decided it looked really great. Maybe my experience was a fluke! We hoped so anyway, as we set out about 30 miles or so across the city to eat at Haus Murphy's.

So we wait for about 30 minutes for a table and get a seat outside. It's a nice atmosphere, but immediately we notice the menu we've been given doesn't have a whole bunch of stuff on it that's on their website menu. We bring this up to the server and he tells us they serve a limited menu for 6 weeks during Glendale Glitters. 

We sit there and stew for about 5 minutes over this menu thing. None of the things we wanted to order are on this limited menu. We decide that's BS and get up and leave. We see our server and tell him we're leaving since their menu isn't the one advertised on their website. He tells us we should have called to check. Excuse me?? Is it my responsibility to call to make sure your website is updated?? What am I, your project manager??

Thanks a lot, Haus Murphy's, for wasting a couple of hours of our precious Saturday night time and about $15 in gas. Maybe you should update your website to let people know what you actually serve at your restaurant. Misleading advertising to say the least."}
{"text":"This place has the best German beer on tap! Good flavor and well worth the trip to try out. You will not be disappointed. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Give them an inch and they take the whole ruler! 

And by that, I mean their sausage platter. Hey girl heyyy! They taught me how to say, \"sausage\" in German but I completely forgot because I was full of tubed meats and beer. The food was exquisite and the beer came in a 32oz stein. It put me on my ass. I had to find me a bench because dang. I also had a bowl of soup and some schnitzel. It was way too much food but I was a happy camper. Easily the best $60 I spent in a while.

So come here for some beer and weiners! The large beeris indeed large!"}
{"text":"My husband, my 14 month old and I went here Friday for the chocolate festival. I'd been there a few years before and remembered I didn't like it but couldn't remember why so I thought Id give it another try. I loved the pumpkin soup and the brie but the other food was just decent and we had horrible service. I had to ask 3 times for the heater next to us to be turned on and another 3 times just for silverware. Our waitress had a bad attitude and was flat out rude. She never refilled our drinks and it took over an hour to get our food. I understand when it's busy it's more difficult to focus on tables but she literally never came to our table on her own we had to get up and ask for her or flag her down for everything. The people sharing our table ordered the $5 beers and the waitress didn't even tell them the restaurant was out she just gave them beers that were $3 more a piece like they wouldn't even notice it on the bill. When they confronted her she rolled her eyes and treated them like dirt. We really are easy patrons, I've worked in the food industry so I make it a point to be patient and not flip out but seriously this waitress was the worst and it makes me angry that people are out there are struggling to find jobs and this woman has one and performs it horribly. I don't care how bad of a day you are having, when you go to work don't be lazy and rude just do it 100% because if you don't than there is someone out there who deserves that paycheck more than you. Also, and this has nothing to do with the rating, but the waitresses dress in German wear if you can even call it that and our waitress specifically was wearing was wearing an extremely low cut top, something that would give hooters a run for their money and she was practically spilling out, I'm far from a prude but it was distasteful and inappropriate and I shouldn't have to worry when I'm about to eat that my server is about to accidentally flash me. I get it, drunken men are probably going to tip the waitress with her chest falling out of her shirt pretty well but seriously save that kind of attire for a different establishment. I'm giving it one star based on our terrible waitress, the waiter at the table next to us seemed awesome and very attentive. We won't be going there again."}
{"text":"enjoyed  people present great service great menu was I lucky and wonderful accordion player"}
{"text":"We love the food here! Any schnitzel is a winner! Good authentic German food and we appreciate that since we lived in Germany for a few years. This place let's is remember how much we loved the foods and also how much wr miss it!"}
{"text":"So far, I can only review the bar for this place, but that's all one needs to be sold on Haus Murphy's. Virtually anything and everything I could think of was stocked in the dense cabinets, and the tap selection was amazing. Amazing, I tell you! Now, I've never had German beer, but my Dunkel Optimiser hit the spot and packed quite a punch. Would drink again, especially since you can get it as a 32. oz. Are you up to that challenge?

Of course, the overall atmosphere also rocks. I've walked by here a million times and seen the live polka and such. Consider this a place a glimpse of a culture you won't see too often around these parts. Can't wait to tell you about the food!"}
{"text":"So goooood. Everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing. I highly recommend the saurkraut puffs appetizer they are my new love!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and food here. Excellent service too. In the heart of downtown Glendale. Have eaten here a few times already and never disappointed either"}
{"text":"I did not have Highhope's for this place, but was pleasantly surprised. The food tasted great, and was really well prepared. The staff was very friendly. The beers were great. Highly recommend going back here."}
{"text":"Reheated, insipid food and perfunctory service in a kitschy atmosphere.

We drove 32 miles from our house to Haus Murphy's because we were in the mood for German.  It was the middle of a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't very busy.

We ordered a couple of beers and the Bauernplatte combination for 2.  This includes several kinds of sausage, a pork cutlet, a schnitzel, a kind of hamburger in gravy, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spatzle and fried potatoes.  

It look great! Sadly, it all appeared to have been pre-cooked and then microwaved.  

Let me repeat that -  a precooked and microwave schnitzel!  The spaetzle in particular was a soggy, water-logged travesty.  $35 for this by the way.

So with two beers and tip, that was $60.00 for lunch. For microwaved food.

It's quite sad that they don't really care about the quality of food here.  This type of Bavarian food is fairly easy to prepare so it's hard to understand why they would have so much contempt for the customers or the lovely cuisine of Germany.

Any restaurant that would serve you reheated food like this really doesn't care about you or about the food they are serving.

I wish I had noticed the 50 filtered reviews before eating here."}
{"text":"This place is great fun.  Who would have thought you could feel like you were at a German beer garden while in downtown Glendale.   Sitting outdoors under the string lights and German beer flags just made you thirsty for beer! Nice selection of draft beers, all were tasty and available in 16 or 32 oz size.  Had sausage sampler with very good sauerkraut . Fresh pumpernickel and rye bread to munch on. Simple dinner salads.  Tried two types of schnitzel, both were great, wanted to order the gnocchi but they just ran out and then had the chicken Marsala which was just OK.
They had two accordion players playing classic tunes like the \"chicken dance song\" and \"it's a small world after all\".  Mmm good polka music and beer.  

This place does close at 9, otherwise it would be a great place to hang out all night.  Will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Finally a place with Eisben!! A very nice German restaurant with very authentic cuisine, big portions and nice beers."}
{"text":"The bartender was good and friendly. My beef is with the owner who would not honor a 2 for 1 deal with one of the meals to go or give us a free pretzel as the 2nd meal. My friend that went with me could not eat anything on the menu because EVERYTHING had meat or egg in it except for the pretzel. Food was also just mediocre nor did the beer seem fresh."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. This was our time eating German cuisine. I don't know if this is actual German food or the Americanized Version of German food. For example like Chinese food, if you travel to China I can assure you won't find a Panda Express cuisine type restaurant anywhere. Panda Express is American Chinese food. That being said the \"German Food\" at this restaurant didn't impress.  I don't think I will ever go out of my way to eat German food again. To be fair the Giant Pretzel was amazing. The sausage sampler was delicious. But aside from that, the food seemed kinda bland. The breaded protein with the crispy potatoes is called The schnitzel you have a choice of chicken veil and pork. That was ok. German pasta is called Spätzle, it has a different texture but it was bland didn't have any flavor to it. Deserts were delicious we had the  chocolate cake and the cherry   I was not aware that this restaurant had been on TV. I guess one of Guy Fieri shows filmed and reviewed this restaurant. Good for them. If you're close by stop in and have a pretzel and a beer. Skip the menu."}
{"text":"#WVFN rolled in to Haus Murphy's last night.

For starters, they have proper 32oz glasses, so they're already a hit in my book.

Started the eating part of the night with a couple giant pretzels.

Giant is correct; the thing was as big as my head! And big, puffy, salty, and delicious! With the brown mustard, it was definitely a hit!

We ordered the Bauernplatte, which is listed as a combo for two, but handily accommodated three of us.

The schnitzel was delicious, the german fried potatoes were delicious, bratwurst was ok.

I avoided the red cabbage because I'm not a fan, but the other diners stated it was fantastic.

Beer:
Weihenstephan Hefeweizen was everything a wheat beer should be; rich and full-bodied, but not too heavy, with a very light citrus attribute.

Franziskaner Weissbier was phenomenal! Delicious, rich, perfect.

Franziskaner Dunkel was superb.

Can't wait to sample the remainder of their selections.

The live music was really awesome.

They have a nice patio, with misters, so even in the summer it should be pleasant.

I would never have guessed a place like this existed in Glendale. Now that I'm aware of its existence, I will certainly try to return."}
{"text":"It took me a while to realize my vision of dining at Haus Murphy's. I first became aware of them from watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives on Food Network. In fact, I stole their paprika gravy recipe when hosting an Oktoberfest dinner party at my house. It was delicious over home-cooked schnitzel. I had to guess on amounts of ingredients, since Guy Fieri does the superfast play-by-play on the cooking process, but it worked out just fine. So I'm quite familiar with German food and have even pickled and cooked my own sauerbraten (sour beef roast). I had to try the sauerbraten at Haus Murphy's!

In a nutshell, I have to say that Haus Murphy's has delicious, authentic-tasting German food. The rotkohl (red cabbage) is right-on-the-money and the sauerkraut is truly fabulous. The sauerbraten was also very good... tender, slow-cooked, and thinly-sliced with just enough twang to wake you up. My buddy ordered the steamed smoked pork chops which were porkaliciously snarfable.

I do have some critical notes on what didn't work, however. The spätzle (mini noodle/dumplings) were uninteresting and watery. Didn't have the remarkable fluffy but chewy texture I expected (and yes, I've made my own spätzle). The sauerbraten, while delicious, simply suffered from being too tiny of a portion. I think even if they charged an extra buck or two, it would be worth it, but this was not a fair dinner-size portion. My buddy even had pity on me and let me share his pork chops (which were a generous portion).

So five stars for food and service and beer selection, but I have to hold back one star for residual hunger pangs. I will definitely be back to dine here again. But if I want to get full next time, I'm gonna load up on the pork! (As you may not know, pork is considered a vegetable in Germany...)"}
{"text":"This IS as good as it gets for authentic German food in Arizona.

I went here with a large party for my birthday dinner. We called ahead and they were very accommodating. We enjoyed a variety of absolutely delicious cold beers to start it off in large 1 liter glasses. Schnitzel was crunchy and delicious, and I sampled the jaegerschnitzel as well that my wife had. Also phenominal. 

For my birthday was was serenaded by an accordian player in German. I don't speak any German, so he may have been saying anything, but it was unique and very fun. Split tabs was not a problem and the staff was on top of serving us. 

I can't wait to go back! Easy to run up a big bill though with all the delicious food and beer, but it was worth the money."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, even before they moved to their current location. We went for dinner on 06/25/2016. I ordered my favorite beer and it was warm and a little flat. The schnitzel appeared to have been cooked at a previous time and reheated in the microwave. We got a slice of the chocolate sauerkraut cake, as we always do. The slices keep getting smaller every time we go. This time it did not taste the same as it used to. The cake was not as dense as it used to be and lacked something.
I think the place has passed its prime and that is very unfortunate.
If you are going to skimp to save a buck, you should just close the business. It's better to go out of business leaving your long time customers with good memories rather than bad ones."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is Old World charm in the middle of historic Glendale.  But it sure isn't the place for vegetarians! And while knew I would be surrounded by wiener schnitzels, I also thought I'd be able to find something I could eat.  And I did, but barely! 
They have a cheese schnitzel, literally the ONLY meatless thing I could find on the menu, but it was good.  The potato dumplings are really tasty too.

I think this place is worth a visit, even if you don't eat meat, you can have the cheese schnitzel and a humungous beer and feel like you're in Germany for the day!"}
{"text":"Where else can you sit outside for a nice lunch, guaranteed shade, full bar, and feel like you're back in Germany - Haus Murphy's.  We were greeted by a nice German lady who warned us of a couple of sweat bees that were wanting a taste a beer but weren't interested in the people.   No bother.  They left us alone.  Lunch was great!  I had a daily special sandwich that was hackbraten on grilled rye bread.  I can't remember what it was called.  My hubs is a sucker for Sauerbraten.  Also ordered a plate of potato pancakes.  

Best pancakes we have found, ever. 

My mom and step dad aren't impressed with this place as they used to be and they live in the area but I had to see for myself.  It's too bad their experiences aren't what we had.  We loved it.  Also tried the new Schoffhofer grapefruit beer.  I am on the hunt for this stuff now.  It's so good!   I handed my hubs the keys and ordered another.  Too bad we cannot get the beer here in Michigan.  The bill was a little hefty but we weren't watching it and it was worth the wonderful afternoon of leisurely lunching with the old folks on a weekday afternoon. 

There isn't a large selection of German restaurants in the Valley but you don't need anymore more when you have Haus Murphy in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!

It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.

How do you say, \"Damn that was good!\" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).

The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.

There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.

It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!"}
{"text":"Good place to get your oompapa on.  Liters of beer, real german food.  Little pricey but worth it.  Will be back again.  Indoor and outdoor seating in a nice part of town."}
{"text":"I was walking with the family by Glendale Glitters and noticed Haus was right down the street. My sister loved the pretzels there, so we went.

The staff didn't look to busy for a Sunday evening and they took a good 10 minutes to even greet us, which bugged me a bit. After they finally greeted us, the female hostess got mad at us for seating ourselves. But we just listened to the guy up front and he told to seat ourselves,  which we explained to the female. 

Now to the food. I don't know if it is cause I'm Mexican, but the food was very bland and tasteless. The pretzel was only okay at best. The other thing we ordered was the stuffed mushrooms and you can only taste the mushroom itself. Where's the sausage and other flavors?

Safe to say, I won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Went there after seeing it DD&D.  Waiter barely gave us time to look over the menu, then took his time coming back to take our order. Not even a crust of bread on the table to begin with. We ordered the sausage sampler and potato pancake. Very average and overpriced for sausage. We ordered sauerbraten to share and glad we didn't order anything else. The meat was tough, bland and was not cooked in any sauce to make it tender. Thick cut slabs with sauce poured over top. I expected fork tender and this was just plain awful. Staff never asked us how our food was and had to flag down waiter for another drink. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic German cuisine! This is my go-to restaurant, and is well worth any line to get in! Even the dessert is to die for. The servings are huge and you will definitely go home with left overs! My first time here was with my boyfriend. We shared the biggest plate they had, trying a little of everything they had. We had food to go, and we even got dessert to go! You will love the authentic feel of the restaurant, from the music, to the pub. Must go to!"}
{"text":"HOW IN THE WORLD HAVE I NEVER REVIEWED THIS PLACE? Yes, triple D brought me here but amazing food (and beer) is what keeps me coming back. If you've never been you must get the sampler for two. Gives you a chance to try everything. I am obsessed with all of the schnitzel, red cabbage, sauerkraut and basically everything on the menu. The soup of the day is always a hit... Oh we also love the pretzel with cheese, like I will fight someone over the last piece of that. And of course the sauerkraut cake is like nothing you have ever had. Delish. Take it to go because you're going to be stuffed after your meal. Love the choices of German beers. It's always a treat to come here, what other place could impress a full blooded German girl?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had never tried Authentic German food before and there was nothing to eat here for a person who is a vegetarian or a person looking for fresh vegetables. 
 I wish they would add something (even a small salad) for a person who is conscious of their eating habits, or doesn't eat meat/gluten.  The meats we're battered with flour and/or soaked in gravy. 
The beer was good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and as I am not a huge German food fan, I was a tad skeptical at first.  However, I was greeted by warm service.  They have a very authentic menu, and it tastes similar to some of the food that I had in Germany.  My family also loved their selection of beer and dessert.  While the food isn't to die for, it is authentic and pretty good."}
{"text":"First time dining here and it was a decent experience. Our server, Deb, I believe, as very nice and attentive despite the large parties and music playing.
My date and I split the platter for two and found most of it enjoyable. Bland in some spots, though. I travelled through Germany and was surprised at the blandness and yet, powerful sweetness in some of the items. 
I also thought the menu was really short; 2 appetizer choice, maybe 10 entrees. This seemed strange because I had read the menu on the way there and then saw none of the items I would have wanted on the limited menu. After reading another review (now, 5 hours since We were there) it looks like they limit the menu for Glendale Glitters. Would have helped to have known that before We got a sour taste in our mouths on the place already. 
We said we would be back, but certainly aren't counting down the days until then. Maybe for Oktoberfest"}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything about Hauz Murphy. We weren't sure it would be authentic German food by the name but one look at the food and atmosphere and there was no mistake. We loved the Wienerschnitzel and the sauerbraten. And don't forget the pretzel. The mustard served with the  pretzel is the real thing (with just the perfect little bite to it). The pretzel fed four of us for an appetizer. The sauerkraut cake was so moist and loaded with fudge frosting!  We will be sure to come back and bring our friends!"}
{"text":"Beer awesome soup ok both my wifes and my plates were awful. I had the plate Guy Furie had when his show was there tasted like a microwave dinner cabbage gross dumpling no flavor  my wife's tasted like Dinty More canned stew her spatzle awful too. Prices outrageous for quality service was a bright spot. May go back for beer and huge pretzel that's about it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our second time just last night. The waiter was on point and the food was amazing. We sat outside and the it was perfect with music and great atmosphere. I was very impressed. We will be back. Thank you Haus Murphy's!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We went on a Friday night.  The food was excellent, service was great.  Angela was our server and made sure we never lacked drinks and that our food came out at a great, comfortable pace.  Great live German music and an excellent outdoor seating area.

And beer in 32oz steins.  Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Mien Gott, look no further for amazing German food. I've come here twice and will back come many more. The owner is amazingly personable and makes you feel like a priority even when the whole restaurant is full. Our server (I feel awful I don't remember his name but the blond one) was just as personable. He joked with us and was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu. We got to sit outside and really soak in the atmosphere, the polka music was a wonderful addition. No doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed place with both indoor and outdoor dining. The menu isn't overly large but plent of different options. Portions are generous but not ridiculous.  A little worn at the seams but still a nice stop downtown."}
{"text":"Been there a few times.  I really enjoy eating outside.  Sometimes they have an outdoor musician.  

I've been to Germany and the food is legit, but it's not my favorite cuisine.  My wife is part German and absolutely LOVES this place.  Service was always great.

It's definitely not inexpensive.  We only go on rare special occasions.  The wait to get seated gets nuts during Octoberfest.  They do take reservations.

I highly recommend coming during holidays when Glendale Glitters is in full swing."}
{"text":"\"Fantastic German food\" is what I have heard from EVERY person I know who's ever been here. I agree. Every plate I tried was impressive. They also have some great rare German beers."}
{"text":"What a great place! Very cute, inside and out. We sat on the patio as the weather was beautiful. I was here with my family and this was our first time at Haus Murphy's. I'm always up for trying new things it was just a chore trying to get my dad to agree.
We started with the Sausage Sampler ($9.95) which was really good. The only thing that would have made it better is if we had another type of sausage. I don't consider 2 types of sausage to be a sampler platter.
I had the Schweizer Schnitzel ($14.95) which apparently is a Swiss traditional meal, tender Pork Loin wrapped with Emmenthaler Cheese and Black Forest Ham, breaded and sautéed with the Chef's Paprika Sauce (an extra $2)
It came with the German fried potatoes - which are fried in bacon grease. Everything was really REALLY good. Now the food all seems to be rather fragrant as you could smell all the great food everyone else was eating. I was expecting it to be very flavorful. Like an explosion of taste when I bit in. It was not. The tastes of everything were simple which I think I enjoyed more than I normally would have. I was able to concentrate and define various flavors a bit easier than normal I guess. It came with this creamy cabbage concoction which was superb! 
For dessert I had something that sounded truly disgusting but was WONDERFUL. The Sauerkraut cake. It is a rich moist chocolate cake without a hint of sauerkraut taste. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
I will definitely be back. I think this would be a fun place to go with a large group of people! Maybe next time I will have to try some of their beer and definitely the giant pretzel.
Oh and the waiter was superb. I think my mom even developed a little crush on him."}
{"text":"If you have ever eaten at an exceptional German restaurant, you will be ruined for life. Years ago, the Haus would have gotten 4 stars. But after being turned on to a little gem in Gibson City, IL called \"The Bayrn Stube\" my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed. Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world. Probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container. 
My meal was the Nuernberger/Kassler combo for one, and I had enough left over for breakfast the next day. Their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than I would get at Sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it. Not that I mind a little pork fat in my cabbage, but not chunks, and definitely not gristle. My friend ordered the Huehner (Chicken) Schnitzel, which had a very good flavor, it was the best part of either of our meals. They do have a nice selection of good beers on tap, no Aventinus though. 
If the food was anything other than German, it would get 2 stars. It is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We went here based on the Food Network show (Guy Fieri) in hopes of having a fine German meal.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed in the food and the overall experience.

Upon arrival we were greeted and led past the more formal dining areas to the bar area in the back of the restaurant.  It is a large room set up with many long tables that seemed similar to a Bavarian beer hall.  The tables were covered with vinyl I guess to make cleanup easier.  Three or four other tables were occupied plus a few people at the bar.  I imagine the room would be much busier during Octoberfest. But we thought it was kind of cool since it did create an German like atmosphere.

Our waiter arrived and while he was not rude he certainly was not friendly and seemed like he would have preferred to be somewhere else that evening.  He did not make any recommendations or inform us of any specials. 

We ordered our meals and appetizers which were the Wienerschnitzel and Saurbraten along with one potato pancake appetizer and one pretzel.

The meal started out with a small cup of the soup of the day which was cabbage soup.  It came out slighty warm at best and was like a broth with a mild flavor and a few bits of cabbage.  Very bland and unimpressive start.

The meals came next and also were only slightly warm.  The sauerbraten consisted of thin slices of beef which was nothing like I remembered from visits to Germany. The flavor was mild and hard to understand why Guy Fieri raved so much about it on his show.  The Wienerschnitzel was greasier than I would have preferred but it was a huge serving that covered half the plate.  The German fried potatoes were good but would have been much better had they been hot.  The spatzel and red cabbage was as expected but unremarkable.

We finished the meal sharing a large slice of the Saurkraut cake which was the best part of the meal.  Overall the cost of the three entrees, two appetizers, one dessert and two small beers was $103 + tip.  

We came with high expectations (perhaps too high) and left somewhat disappointed.  I doubt we will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Killer schnitzel and liter mugs of Franziskaner. What more can you ask for? Excellent patio atmosphere--make sure to sit outside when the weather is nice. Love the tuba and accordion guys on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3-4 times and always enjoy it. Although I cannot enjoy the many schnitzel's (breaded and therefore not gluten free) my bf says they are wonderful. I myself usually get one of the many bratwursts they offer and have always been pleased. The German fried potatoes and the sauerkraut are outstanding! I usually start off with a Gewurztraminer wine and a friend usually gets a German beer. On a recent Saturday evening visit, a German 2-man band was playing to add to the ambiance. Our server was attentive but didn't hover. Always an enjoyable time here."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Spring Training, My wife and I stop at Haus Murphy's.  We went with some friends this past time.  The portions are generous and the food is fabulous.  We like the ambiance and there is plenty of parking in the back.  I recommend ordering the pretzel as a started, as good as it gets.   We noticed another couple ordering two to go so they could take them to a ball game."}
{"text":"I really like Haus Murhpy's.  A little taste of Germany in the middle of downtown historic Glendale.  The huge homemade soft pretzel with mustard is a must have for an appetizer.  Great German beer choices.  They serve a wheat beer with no hops.  Being allergic to hops, it's nice to have that option.  They have several schnitzels to choose from and the saurbraten is greatt.  Everything on the menu is tasty.  You have to try the sauerkraut chocolate cake for dessert.  The sauerkraut makes it so moist.  Trust me.   

This is comfort food.  You wont' find much in the way of diet foods here.  If that's what you're looking for, then you'll have to go elsewhere.  There are no gluten free items on the menu as far as I know.

Otherwise, I think you'll love it.  Quaint and homey."}
{"text":"[UPDATE] My December 2011 still stands pretty much as I wrote it then, minus just under a half star but not enough to take them down to 3-stars (yet). We have been to Haus Murphy's since 2011 but I wanted to do a quick update based on this, my December 2014 visit. This time we shared what the website describes as a single combination plate (the printed menu calls it something different) and the Roulade, which is described similarly to the online menu. We did that because we could get tastes of a bratwurst, a slightly smoked pink pork chop, the Roulade, German potatoes, sauerkraut, red cabbage and spaetzli.

Everything was okay. I liked the taste of the Roulade, if I didn't know what was supposed to be in it, which their menu states as filled with Pickle, Bacon and Onion; smothered with Golden Mustard. The reality is I could see, find nor taste any of the above. More like they mystery paste that's inside a Chef Boyardee Ravioli. It tasted fine but none of those flavors was present in any way, and it's pretty hard to hide the tastes of pickle, bacon, onion and mustard!

Instead of beer we opted for a nice hearty white wine. Some things have changed a bit over time ... the spaetzli was served plain, no gravy. The soup was much better but still served lukewarm. And some things haven't changed ... for example they still don't serve nor offer a bread plate. It's like they have no clue how meals are served in Germany and most of eastern Europe. Our server (Austin) was almost everything you would want in a server ... polite, attentive, upbeat and happy (as everyone at Haus Murphy seems to always be). On the downside, I would suggest he learn just a minimal amount about the very limited selection of wines they offer. His response to our basic wine questions was very deer-in-the-headlights.

My rating hasn't changed; they still are very good with the potential of earning 5-stars if they tried harder. The only (huge) negative that I won't grade them on is that whenever the front door is opened (about every 5 seconds) a frigid blast of cold air rushes in and quick-freezes everything on your plate. There has to be a better way, like build another door from the kitchen directly to the patio so they don't have to carry plated meals through the dining room (how hard could that be?). Until then I just wanted to yell \"Murphy, Shut The Front Door!\"

Final note ... NO restaurant anywhere that wants to be taken more seriously than a Denny's should EVER serve ice water in plastic Pepsi tumblers. For a sit-down restaurant that is a total fail."}
{"text":"We stopped in following a AKC dog show at Glendale Stadium.  I found Haus Murphy's on \"petcentric.com\" and called to ensure that they were open and were, in fact, dog friendly.  It was Easter and I also wanted to make sure that they would be open becuase it was only 11:00 a.m.  The woman who answered the phone said that they had a brunch, and although it was not fully set up yet, we were welcome to come by early.  She confirmed dogs were welcome in the beer garden (aka patio).  We arrived and were warmly greeted, they offered water and dog biscuits for my two girls, and also offered a special plate of \"people food.\"  The buffet was terrific!  Great german specialities and my husband also enjoyed the roast beef.  The owner/chef came out and chatted with us.  It was an all-around terrific experience, and we will undoubtedly go back for the art walks and other events in Glendale just to visit this terrific restaurant."}
{"text":"I held off on this review, I was here on New Years Eve before heading to westgate and again this past week.  

The service is fantastic, the beer is great, and the food, well that has become really hit or miss.

I would love to 5 star this place because I grew up in the area and have been here dozens of times and it had been great.  But recent trips there have left me using the word \"bland\" a lot.  The pork schnitzel was flat out not good, and the spicy brat which was always one of my favorites here did not measure up either.  Worst of all, on my new years eve visit, they were \"out\" of the fried potatos and left us with average potato salad and french fries.

I'll probably be back, because I go to many downtown Glendale events, and have a little sentimental value in this place...but I sure hope it steps back up."}
{"text":"I went here on a date night, beautiful ambiance and fun restaurant...ALOT of meat meals to go around, purple cabbage was really good"}
{"text":"Beer good! Atmosphere fun! Good place to eat outside if its a nice day.  Food good but overpriced.  I had snizle and it was ok but for the money not worth it.  The service was pretty good and the staff knowledgeable about German beers and food.  Its good to try once and that's bout it just to say you did."}
{"text":"So so so good!! Loved the food and the ambiance. Great service too! We've gone a few times now and each time is the same. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice time with friends and family! The food was good, the 32-oz beer was tasty and the atmosphere was pretty authentic (so I'm told. I never been to Germany.) 

I wasn't a fan of the cheese type soup and, like any normal person, I didn't like the sauer kraut. Otherwise, the sausage, German potatoes and wiener snitzel (sp?) were great!

The 32-oz beer was $11 and our meals were $14.95 each. All in all, not too bad at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks back. I know almost nothing about German food so I took some time with the menu before ordering. Our server and all the staff we dealt with were all very nice and helpful with offering suggestions and answering questions. We ended up ordering a couple appetizers and pretty much the whole table ordered schnitzel of some kind. Everything was very good, though a couple of the sides weren't my thing, but I would have no problem going back here again for dinner. Also, everything I ate that was bread of some kind was outstanding. This place is a carb lover's paradise."}
{"text":"I love this place. Period. Nice atmosphere some life German music ( if u lucky) it's like a small piece of Germane in the heart of Glendale. Never was disappointed by the food we ordered. The only warning try not to \"judge\" them on Glendale glitters time. It is really crazy there. Tons of people. And menu on this period is really limited. To enjoy the food and atmosphere make a reservation on weekends also. 
Unfortunately I can't find a lot of things that I can eat there now since I became vegetarian/vegan ( no milk no meat) but they still could modify some of their dishes to accommodate my needs. Which I greatly appreciated! 
All food there is delicious but I was stuck on my meatloaf lol. Every time when we came I used to tell myself that I will order something else but every single time I cannot cheat on my favorite dish. Lol
I did grab a bite from my husbands plate every time and it's really good but my heart belongs to that meatloaf. 
I think that's one of the few things that I miss since I stopped eating meat. 
definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The prager schnitzel was pretty good very tasteful. If you were to start trying German food its a great place to start. I would recommend it to the beginner and the intermediate, but not for the hardcore German food lover."}
{"text":"Okay, this is for everyone who has complained about the limited menu during Glendale Glitters and the long wait time to be seated and served. First of all this is not a chain restaurant like Applebees or Chiles where the food is prepared in the midwest and shipped frozen to the restaurant. The menu is limited due to the volume of customers during the winter months. Try coming here during the Spring, Summer or Fall. The menu is expanded, to include the beer, and the crowds are much more tolerable. There are so many tables and chairs to accomodate diners so be patient, or come back another time, such as Spring, Summer or Fall. My wife and I have been coming here since they first opened, in their original location one block west of the current location. The original location was a lot smaller than the current location. They moved because of the overwhelming response of crowds loving the food and beer. 
We realize when we go during the winter months they won't have all of our favorite food and beer selections we normally get. We know they will be busy and the servers will do the best that they can.
If you were disappointed with the food, beer or service during Glendale Glitters, come back during the \"off season\" and you will not be disappointed. Thanks"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Downtown Glendale, this noisy little place caught our attention walking by. Now,  I am not German, nor do I even really know what German food is, but I was actually quite surprised and enjoyed my experience.  

We sat outside in what looks like an alley, where flags hung from above and where one space heaters warmed 2 tables. Nice and cozy. For two people we ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the giant pretzel, and the paprika schnitzel. This was surprisingly way more than enough food. The mushrooms were great! The we opted to get the pretzel with the extra cheese (~$3 more). I could have done without the horseradish tasting cold cheese in the tiny 2oz cup. I think I was expecting the warm yellow gooy cheese you normally find at the fair...heh. The paprika schnitzel we ordered because apparently Guy Ferrari from Food Network got it and it wasn't bad but not the best thing I've tasted in the world. Its giant fried piece of pork(?) with a side of green beans and german fries.

{"text":"We've been wanting to go here for several years, but every time we were in the area, they were out of food, or had a 2 hour wait.  This time, we arrived about 4:50pm to beat the dinner rush before Glendale Glitters.  We were seated immediately, but it took some time for our server to take our drink order.  Then quite some time before the drinks arrived.  After she dropped the drinks off, she left.  Again, quite some time later, she took our order.  One in our party had a hard time deciding.  Instead of possible suggestions, the server just stood there.  The prezels were amazing.  The beer cheese soup came out only lukewarm, but was good.  We advised our server of this issue and she seems uninterested.  Four of our 5 dishes arrived, but our youngest son's chicken strips did not arrive with the rest of the food.  We were told they would be \"right out\".  All our dishes were lukewarm.  We had to ask for refills on our sodas and waters.  Finally, after we were pretty much finished with our meals, my son's chicken strips arrived.  No apologies, no \"let me take that off your ticket\", no nothing.  Server was pretty much non-existent.  Of the dishes, the roulade was excellent, as was the goulash.  Spatzle was bland.  Chicken schnitzel was good."}
{"text":"After I secured the deal on my Bayern filly I was starving and thought to continue German traditions. 

The exterior looks absolutely fantastic! And so does the interior! With girls in German dress which looks very sexy :)

Now, there was a guy John who rocked! Patient, polite, funny and quick. He would tell stories to entertain customers.  His manner to bow was so elegant.
He is from Germany, so I was able to learn a little about that wonderful country.

I ordered the beef roulade and I loved it! I also liked how the portion was sized, not too big so I got no left overs.

It takes time for me to come back to the restaurants I've been to but I already want to visit that place again :)"}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is one of the only German cuisine restaurants in Arizona (as far as I know), and let me tell you, it's tops.

My experience there has been positive. The dining hall is split into three areas, each with it's own distinct feel. There's the bar, complete with accordion player and loads of German booze. The patio, which has a great Euro feel to it. And lastly, there's what I like to call the \"breakfast\" area, which is closest to the main entrance. 

These three distinct areas cover quite a bit of ground, and definitely add to the feel of the \"German\" experience. 

I have only had one dish the several times I've been to Murphy's, but that's all you really need from a place like this. My go-to meal is the Stuffed Mushrooms. These babies are HUGE, stuffed to the brim with fine german-style meat, The sauce they place them in is superb and ultimately makes it.

I would recommend Haus Murphy to anyone looking for something different in the metropolitan Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Whoa, totally don't understand the love for this place.  We met with a group over here and boy was I disappointed.  To begin, why doesn't Glendale have meters?  Why do I have to go out and move my car every two hours?  That makes it really hard to drink and sober up without drinking and driving if I have to go out and move my car to a new spot every 120 minutes.  That's not Haus Murphy's fault but it is something that will deter me from going out there to drink.  

So we get in there and our waitress is awesome enough.  She is friendly, responsive, and helpful.  In fact, I want that waitress to come with me to some other restaurants (looking at you Fez) and show them how it should be done.  In any event, she was great and the only saving grace of this establishment.

Now on to the bad food.  I'm not German, never been to Germany, and my German culinary knowledge is limited to Milwaukee Brewers' baseball games.  That being said, food either tastes good or it doesn't.  I had the Wullwurst sausages.  They came out looking like fried Twinkies and tasted about the same.  No spice, no real flavor, and surrounded by a tough skin.  They were flanked by some purple cabbage that was unedible and some German potato salad that was some of the nastiest mush I've ever had.  

Apparently unsatisfied by this gluttonous torture that I had already endured, I ordered the German chocolate cake.  Now, I know this isn't an actual German food but it looked good and I thought they might go all out with it.  Nope, again - not good.  Flavorless.  I was basic chocolate cake with a thin layer of coconut on top and some Betty Crocker frosting on the outside.  

Sorry but this place was just not good and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Haus Murphy's is an incredible experience! 

Some friends and I ate here before the Chocolate Affaire. I kind of wish we had just hung out here for the night instead! Delicious food, awesome entertainment and stellar patronage awaits you at Haus Murphhy's. If you aren't stuffed after your schnitzel, you need to try the sauerkraut chocolate cake. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not much omm pa pa in this German restaurant. Ach du lieber. 

My dad was career military and our family was stationed in Heidelberg, Germany for several years, while I was a teenager. I was fortunate for many things, among them the ability to enjoy a wide variety of tasty and authentic German foods. I miss the German comfort food from my youth. 

That's why I was so excited to hear about Haus Murphy. Not only is it located nearby, in the Phoenix area, it has also been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives - so it must be good, right? 

Well, actually, not so much. I ordered the Schweizer Schnitzel, pork loin with sliced ham and cheese. Sounds scrumptious, but was actually a bit dry and I'm not sure I could have detected the ham and cheese unless I knew it was (supposed to be) there. My husband had the Chicken Schnitzel with white wine mushroom sauce. Even though I'd never heard of chicken being made into a schnitzel, it was better than mine. Entrees include a side of German potatoes and also Wirsing (creamed cabbage) both good. In addition, we ordered a side of red cabbage (great) and also spatzle noodles (fair). 

The live omp pah band had good intentions, but was so loud it disturbed the customers.  I heard one customer ask the waiter to please move the band away from their table because it was making for an unpleasant dining experience.

Overall, nothing horrible, nothing great, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening, my husband & I went to Haus Murphy's .

The atmosphere was truly \"Gemutlich\" or friendly and warm. The service was great , our waiter was prompt, efficient and helpful.

The meal was Wunderbar! We started the evening with stuffed mushrooms then for the main course we enjoyed the Bauernplatte - Combo for Two (A generous platter with our German Bratwurst, Rote Bratwurst, Hackbraten, Kassler Kotelett and Pork Schnitzel served with Sauerkraut, Red Cabbage, German Fried Potatoes and Schwäbische Spätzle). The entree's also come with a cup of soup.

My husband quench his thirst with Warsteiner Dunkel beer while I enjoyed the German Margarita and listened to the live music while dining on the outdoor patio. 

Unfortunately we had no room left for dessert but we have had their strudels and bread pudding in the past and both are yummy bites of heaven.

Always a great time and fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"The last time I had AMAZING German food like this place was when I visited family in Jasper IN about 18 years ago.  The soup of the day was a cream of mushroom soup, and OMG, it was SOOOO good!  We had the Sample Sausage appetizer, the Schweizer Schnitzel, and the Kassler Kotelett.  OMG, the food was AMAZING!!!!  This was my husband's first time ever having German food, and he LOVED it.  We're looking forward to going back again real soon!"}
{"text":"Ditto all the previous reviews, I've been to this place 3 times now and have never been disappointed.

This time I shared the Bartlett Pear and Black Forest sandwich.
And of course potato pancakes.
For dessert, we shared an apple strudel.

Absolutely Scrumptious!

I've had the Hefeweizen before...yummmm.

I love the new place, and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst German food I've ever had.  The server was very nice though, and the pretzel was okay."}
{"text":"I have been to Haus Murphy's twice and both time I was very disappointed with their food.
Their Schnitzel was just horrible so was the Schweinebraten.
The owner should seriously send his cooks to Germany for a week so they will have a better idea on what to serve.
While the service and atmosphere is quite good I would not recommend unless you just going there for Beer."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint! The food is amazing. I am German and have been to Germany and the food is very close!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area and my friend who lives there suggests we try this place.  He seemed enthusiastic about it and I know that when a local gets that way about someplace in their backyard, it must be good.  It was.  It is tucked away along Glendale Blvd. and it is bigger than it looks on the outside.  It also has a dining patio that has a lot of flags hanging down over it. The interior looks like you have stepped into a diner in Germany or the Alps.  
 
I ordered the Jager Schnitzel and it was very tender and lots of flavor.  My wife ordered the Nurnberger Bratwurstchen and it seemed like a lot but she finished it.  I tried a bite and the sausage had a snap when you bit into it, was juicy and had a lot of flavor.  Everyone is our party was stuffed, but we still shared a slice of Bavarian chocolate cake!  

This restaurant was a fun new experience for us as we have never had German before and I can say I will be back when I am visiting the Phoenix area again."}
{"text":"Love Huas Murphy's!! The food is excellent! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. They make you feel like you're family! It does get pretty loud depending on what time you go but overall it's a really awesome and fun place!"}
{"text":"Took a little long to get the food. I've been here for an hour and a half- the food took over an hour. Great quality, great beer, nice servers, but they just need to speed up a little."}
{"text":"What a special treat. Very rarely do you find an authentic German restaurant.... and a good one at that! I ordered the steak salad without cheese and the red cabbage. My mom ordered the jagerschnitzel and was amazing. The drinks we fun, a German margarita and the melon something... But the red cabbage was my favorite! It reminded me of my Omas. Beautiful gem, family friendly in the front, full lounge in the back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My family is German and I have been to Germany.  This place is legit.  Great service, food, German beer selection etc.  love the Jager schnitzel, German potato salad and cabbage is delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing food , old country recipes , a quaint Lil place nesting in downtown old Glendale.  My GF of 7yrs went there with me on our first date for lunch"}
{"text":"We love German food and had heard this was one of the best.   It was okay......not the worse nor the best we have had but yes we might go back.  We both got the sauerbraten and red cabbage and the meat is so tender you can cut it with a fork.......and we did!  Red cabbage needed to be a little more 'tart' for us but realize that everyones recipe is different. Our waitress was very knowledgable about the beers and most helpful in explaining and answering our questions. Only complaint I have is the hostess. She asked if we wanted to sit outside, hot day so I said only if we can be in the shade. No shade - she she seats us in the bar area.   Had I realized this before - it was our first time there - I would have insisted that we were seated in the nice part of the restaurant. She was a little snippy when I said we should go inside due to the heat.  And yes we had reservations.  We will go back.......as the over all experience was good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Germany but I have been to Haus Murphy's. Why does this matter? Haus Murphy's makes me feel like I haven't missed out on the great beer halls of Europe.

My first visit to Haus Murphy I was serenaded by a tubist (Duane) and an accordion player (Elmer). Both gents were wearing short lederhosen and alpine hats (complete with a feather!) Perhaps entertained by my slack jawed expression they asked for my name.  And so I heard the song \"Good night Irene\" as performed by a tuba and an accordion. These guys are here on Friday and Saturday nights, 6:30-8:30pm. They take requests!

You should come hAngry. The food is served in enormous sized portions. The Wiener Schnitzel is perfectly delivered. \"But Irene. You haven't been to Germany!\" Heck no. But I've been to Vienna and have gobbled my way thru many a schnitzel.  Haus Murphy's version is tenderly prepared, lightly fried in such a way you want to forget about the calories involved. 

I've had the good fortune to enjoy the indoor and outdoor spaces, in small, medium and large groups. The outside space is a wonderful venue to enjoy people watching. The indoor space readily accommodates larger parties. I would recommend coordinating in careful detail if your party is larger than ten. At my last visit for Int'l Supper Club the staffing was a little stretched for a party of our magnitude. We ended up walking to the bar to obtain our drinks, which wasn't really too much of an issue.

Haus Murphy's is a really fun place to visit and dine. Also, RSVP for holiday events as they fill up!"}
{"text":"Good place for rich German food. Be prepared to work out an extra hour the next day to keep up your New Years resolution to lose weight. Prices are a bit steep but everything tastes good."}
{"text":"We went to Haus Murphy last night to celebrate a friends birthday.  We have been many times..The service was spot on...we love the German uniforms that they wear...the food is outstanding.  Portions are huge...enough for lunch today.

We had a variety of items from sausages to schnitzels.  Everything was excellent.  They even had a desert with a candle for our friend with the birthday.  To top it off, they sang Happy Birthday in German...Lovely evening"}
{"text":"We had another enjoyable experience here tonight.  The food,  as usual,  was delicious. I had the Guiness Brats and my husband had Paprika Schnitzel.  Our server Carleen was a doll!  They had a special of 2 dinners plus dessert for $24.00.  The portions are large so we ended up getting to go boxes for part of our dinner and the desserts.  I'm sure the strudel dessert  will be delish for breakfast in the morning!"}
{"text":"There is no better German Restaurant in all of Arizona. We first went here in Oktoberfest, where the set up long tables, and tents with a real German band, huge beer stein and German food, what fun.   The food and beer is old world good. The staff is happy and having as much fun as we were."}
{"text":"Wow!  Was this place awesome!  I had the meatloaf.. husband had schnitzel..
The server was so patient with us and made us feel special( thank you JImmy!)
What a great experience... who knew I loved German food?!?!  
We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Several weeks ago I committed with a group of 40 people to attend the 2015 Oktoberfest at House Murphy (5739 W. Glendale Ave., Glendale, AZ 85301). Yesterday, on the day of the event, the organizer of our group received a confirmation phone call from them that ended with \"Make sure everyone in your group has $10 cash for the entrance fee.\" This was the very first time it was mentioned!

To add this fee at the last minute, with no time to contact everyone, was a slimy, low-life method of gouging money.

BEWARE of this last-minute trickery at this mendacious establishment."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and was wanting to try it. The bad thing about it was it took 20 minutes from the time I was seated to a waiter to come and ask what I wanted to drink. On the positive side the waiter was friendly. I ordered the original German sausage. The potatoes were perfect to me the sausage was good. It came with a side of soup which was green bean and bacon. The soup was delicious even though I hate green beans but it tasted good so props to them on that. The atmosphere does bring out the German culture along with the music that is being played. If the wait time wasn't horrible then I would see why this would be a five star rating."}
{"text":"I went last night for the first time. I was very excited as I lived in Germany for five years and love German food. My companion and I tried the Sauerbraten and Beef Roulade. 
These are two of my favorite German dishes. I was sorely disappointed. The meat was tough and flavorless as was the Spatzle and Potato Dumpling. The Red Cabbage  was good but I've tasted just as good out of a can. The highlight of the meal was the Onion Soup. That was truly delicious. However, not worth the $45 bill for two people for just the entrees. The Service was excellent with no complaint there. However, I expected much more, especially from a restaurant that has been around as long as this one. If you want to try a truly excellent German restaurant go to The German Cafe in Sierra Vista. It will give you a taste of really authentic German cooking."}
{"text":"Everything my husband and I ordered was great!  I loved the Raspberry German Margarita, and I only had one, because I knew I could have had many and probably would have been dancing on the tables. 

The food was delicious, the atmosphere was lively, complete with a trombone and accordion group that played Old German folk songs, as well as took newer requests.  A little girl requested the song, \"Let It Go,\" and the accordion player happily obliged.  

Apparently, Guy Fiery has showcased this restaurant on the Food Network, but we didn't know this until after we started looking over the menu.  Like I said, everything was delicious, and I'll be back when I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to take it down a notch. We love this place because the food is phenominal, the atmosphere is friendly and they serve some of our favorites, like the german salad and schnitzel, but they have changed their menu. Green beans there were fantastic, and they traded them for boring mushrooms. They did have an unbelievable beef gulosh which is now beef and pork...I don't know what is up with all the changes, but why rattle your frequent customers by switching from perfection which is why we keep coming back? Oh, and if you haven't tried Schofferhauffer...its a grapefruit flavor beer that tastes like summer, fabulous."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, for the very first time last night. Our server was wonderful, she explained the different beers and food items to us. She checked back often once our food arrived to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The food was over the top, never had German food before but know I know I like it!!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Came here on 10/13/17 with my husband. We were carded outside the restaurant by security before we were allowed into the restaurant.

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms ($8.95) as an appetizer, and I ordered the paprika schnitzel ($14.95) while my husband got the schweinshaxen ($19.95). 

I have no idea what was going on with the service because various waiters and food runners came up to us, \"is this your tea?\" Nope. \"Did you order this wine?\" Nope again. \"You ordered this beer?\" Still no.

Our mushrooms came out in a heap on a paper AZ cardinals plate. It tasted fine but presentation looked like something you'd scoop onto your own plate at a backyard bbq.

A half hour after our appetizer came out, we were presented with meals that we didn't order, including some sort of bratwurst. We let the food runner know that it wasn't our order before he even set the food down. 

Our waiter double checked his pad and came back to let us know that he put in the wrong order. We waited another 30+ minutes for our food to come out. My husband's meal was served on a disposable black plastic plate and mine was served on another disposable AZ Cardinals plate. 

There was nothing done to remedy the mix up and the extra long wait for our food. Our waiter had to take off 4 different entrees on our bill that he brought over for us to sign. I had to flag down a waitress just to get a pen to for my husband to sign the check.

We're not driving down here again to eat here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Haus Murphys for several years now and finally made it to downtown Glendale,sorry to say we felt what we ordered was quite underwhelming, I had the Big Smoky Beef Brat with fried potatoes,first off the kraut was absolutely bland, have tasted better out of a jar! and was served maybe three tbs barely enough to lay the sausage on,maybe a good thing,the fried potatoes were mostly burnt and hard,must have been in the cooker the better part of the day. Even the salad served before was kind of sad. Wife had the chicken with a cream sauce that I tried that was rather good though we expected a plump breast not one that looks as it had been through a ringer washer but maybe that's the way German chicken is served . the the potatoes again were burnt and hard.Will say service was excellent.if we go back and right now that's a big if' we'll definitely try other items on the menu staying away from the fried potatos.
All in all for the prices they charge we were quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, authentic German food. Unique German beers you can't get anywhere else. One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out but was turned away because my party wasn't big enough. (My wife and I) The explanation was that it was too busy. 

Very disappointing because I've been wanting to come here but now I'll never return."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy fantastic German Bavarian food and beer . The quality is great and the recipes authentic. Atmosphere and service are a unique combination of Arizona friendliness and German rustic attitude."}
{"text":"It's was OK. A little overpriced. Potions were good, and the patio is nice. I will come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Bauern platter was very good. Red kraut is the best, wurst and schnitzel were perfect. Great service, too."}
{"text":"We went during Glendale Glitters.  Great beers, great band, good food, nice patio.  There was some odd interaction in the beginning where they didn't seem to want us to sit where we saw an empty table further away from the band, but that got straightened out somehow-I paid very little attention.
We all had different beers, and some pretzel bites and other things.  Everything was delicious.
The inside of the restaurant needs a little help, but I didn't see that it hurt business at all.
I had a good time, and am eager to go back."}
{"text":"Was staying in town on business and decided to check this place out because I saw it on DDD on food network.  Got the brat sampler and a side of spatzle.  The brat sampler was as expected, not super great but pretty good overall.  The spatzle wasn't as great as i was expecting and didn't seem to have much flavor at all in general.  Overall I kind of wish I would have tried the Schniztel but doubt I'll be trying this place out again."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great service, & amazing food!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I continued our quest this past Friday evening for a good German restaurant in Arizona.  I am pleased to report that Haus Murphy's is such and that we enjoyed our Jäger Schnitzel meals.  Wifey also ordered the super pretzel to go.  Previous comments have already extolled the virtues of Haus and our experience would tend to support the more positive ones.  We were greeted outside and quickly seated in the moderately busy inside seating.  Our server was fun and engaging.  Service was reasonably quick and correct.  Pork and vegatible soup came with dinner and was pretty good.  The Schnitzel covered almost half the plate and was crispy and tasty.  Life was good.  This is the best German food in Arizona (that we've been to so far).  And a shout out the live accordion music.  The music was spot on with lively toe-tapping beats - Roll Out the Barrel and other familiar drinking songs heard in the beer halls we've all been to.

Of course it's all relative.  I remember back in the day when we lived in Germany we would get cravings for, what else?  Mexican food!  Luckily, one of the local Gasthaus had Mexican night every Thursday.  Being from Arizona, I can tell you that although it wasn't the greatest, it did have some spiciness to the enchilades and came with beans, Spanish rice and a salsa, and it made us happy.  So it was the best Mexican in our area of Germany. 

And so, when we get those cravings for a taste of Germany and it's not Oktoberfest, we know where we can go until the next time we can go get the real deal.  Over there."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the planning and service are atrocious.

First off, reservations don't mean what you think they do.  Make a reservation?  Plan to still wait and then get seated at a community table.

Secondly, they have too much going on.  Most of the year appears to feature a limited menu of one kind or another.  If you go there and it's an open menu day, try not to like the food too much, because it may be a year before you can have it again.

Finally, I've had more crappy service there than I've had good.  Servers have forgotten to bring a course, brought the wrong food, not checked back on us - you name it.

It's sad because the food here really IS good.  It's just so hard to get."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Stop in every time we are in Glendale.  Best German beer selection in the Valley.  Food is really good and they have great staff."}
{"text":"Just returned to try em out again. Jimmy took great care of us once again! Food and service hit it out the park so im officially  convinced this place is the real deal! Probably wont be back soon only because i gotta start dropping some pounds and this place aint gonna be no help.... however, if and when i allow a cheat day Haus Murphys will be on the short list for places to go stuff my face. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"WARNING:  New chef.  I've been coming here happily for years.  First of all, most of the menu is gone, along with the dishes that kept me coming.  I decided to try something new, the Goulash.  Very disapointed.  Even the spatzel was not up to par.   When I expressed this to the waitress, a \"gee I'm sorry\" was the extent of the response as she walked away.   Beer was as good as ever, but not enough to overcome the disapointing food."}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate the beginning of Oktoberfest and decided to treat ourselves to some German beers and German food at Haus Murphy's on a Saturday early evening. We requested to sit in the bar area because we find it more lively than the restaurant area (and on this particular visit there was a polka band playing in the bar area).

To start, we had their giant pretzel. It was baked to perfection. Then, we elected to split their dinner platter for two (the one on the regular menu, not the one on the specials menu, can't remember the exact name). The platter included soup for each of us, which was a creamy chicken florentine - I am usually not a chicken florentine fan but it was really tasty. The platter was perfect to fulfill both of our Sausage and Schnitzel cravings. We also loved the potatoes, weird noodle things (?) and cabbage and sauerkraut that accompanied it.

We finished off with the Black Forest dessert, which was the only part of our meal that was a disappointment - it was dry and tasted like it had maybe been in the refrigerator too long.

We loved hearing the band play while we were there and were extremely satisfied with our Oktoberfest dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you love good German food Haus Murphy's is as good as it gets. We always take advantage of the outdoor Biergarten (ask for Shannon's section, she's the best!) and the atmosphere is wonderful, even in the blistering Phoenix heat. If you go on the weekend you should definitely take advantage of the wonderful tuba and accordion music with a great draft beer.

Also, the food never disappoints. The Jäger Schnitzel is a favorite, along with the ham shank (but you have to catch it on special). Don't miss the Giant Bavarian Pretzel and the stuffed mushrooms are some of the best we've ever had. The BIG Stuffed Cabbage Roll and Schweizer Schnitzel are also some fan favorite. Finally, don't forget to try the Sauerkraut Cake. It's wonderful, especially for chocolate lovers. 

This place is definitely a family favorite and not to be missed on any trip to the Phoenix area. Prost!!"}
{"text":"Wow the sausage selection here is killer! When we arrived, a German style band was playing. Unfortunately, they were replaced by an excellent female singer.... Just doesn't do the mood. Definitely got to order a boot.. A very cute large glass of beer that require a debit card to order. Our favorite sausage was the kilometer... Large, smokey, delicious. We also like the spicy rote and sweet Guinness sausage. I don't normally like sauerkraut but I loved the sauerkraut! Subtle, tasty, keeps me coming back for more! The beer was great also. I'm a dark stout lover so the celebrator was perfect! We came here because it was a tradition... For being my first time, I would come back. It is a very cool, casual ambiance with staff dressed in kinda traditional garb. Give this place a try, just don't come here for a special occasion except ocktberfest!"}
{"text":"Great meals - great service. We were very well taken care of and food was in great portions. You gotta have the pretzel  !!!!"}
{"text":"We attending the closing night of Glendale Glitter and arrived at 4:15pm to eat an early dinner. We had a party of 6 adults, 2 kids and an infant (that remained in his car seat the entire dinner). The place was busy but to our delight, were seated immediately in the back bar area. This is when things started to get rough. Our waitress arrived approximately 15-20 minutes after we were seated to see if she could start is out with some waters. When I asked about the beer menu, she seemed confused... But I thought maybe because that came further along in her checklists of things she was required to accomplish. Once I had the beer menu in have I began asking simple questions about the beer. Like...\"what are the different beers comparable to?\". This is when rough turned worse for our waitress. She explain that the first three beers were \"like Coors light\" and the last two beer so were \"dark beers\". The night only got worse. I'll give you some of the quotes... When asked what the sides (listed in German) were... The response was \"I have no idea\". When asked what type of meat was in the stuffed cabbage... Again \"I have no idea\" followed quickly by the statement \" I am so bad at this\"...I believe she was referring to her job as a waitress.  I actually felt incredibly bad for our waitress. She's just didn't care at all about that job making it painful for both her and the patrons. The food was good. Not great. The best thing we had all night was the spicy sausage cheesy bread appetiser. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Plenty of food but more important to me was that every bite was wonderful.  Service was excellent,  friendly & attentive.  Had enough leftovers for 2 more servings!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, inside and outside in the beer garden.  Food is incredible!!  Great German beer selection.  A fantastic meal and fun atmosphere.  Highly recommend reservations."}
{"text":"On a rainy day, this was the perfect place for a big lunch! Service was good, staff was welcoming and the food was perfectly cooked. 

We shared the plate for two and started with the house cheese, which was all flavorful and just the right size for a large meal. Overall, well worth the drive and I can't wait for a sunny day to enjoy on their patio with a liter of beer and a warm pretzel!"}
{"text":"Haus Murphy is the only authentic German bar/restaurant in the west valley.  They have 10 taps (Weihenstephaner Hefe-Weissbier, Franziskaner Weissbier, Spaten Optimator, Spaten Marzen, Warsteiner, and a couple more...).

Service is usually good and it has a very charming, relaxed atmosphere with German decor.

Mature customer base also... which is to my liking."}
{"text":"Had heard this place had received national recognition for being the best German food...it took them over 1 hour to get our dinner..they forgot my 5 year old niece's order and when they brought her the hot dog it was a shrivilled  up canned cocktail weinie... The food was tasteless..the only thing I can say that was good was the accordion player..never eat here again.."}
{"text":"The food is just so darn good here and the ambience is pretty fun as well. Delicious schnitzels, sausages, wursts, and the roulade - ridiculously good. Our server was cheerful and helpful - thanks for the advice on the Kilometer sausages (best ever!) The beer was ice cold and the oompah music was a blast as well. Can't imagine a better place for German food."}
{"text":"Only heard good things about this place and finally decided to check them out..  We were there on a Sunday and they had a pretty cool band called \"Behind the Badge\" who were raising money for a charitable cause.   I would have given 5 stars but the service was very slow and they did not seem to happy to be serving us outside.  We generally had to get up and walk inside to ask them for food/drinks.  With that out of the way, the food and drinks made up for the poor service!  Tried the soft pretzels(they were out of the large pretzels so I had two smaller ones)  It was a lot of food and seemed somewhat average but not bad.  My aunt got an order of the potato pancakes which were outstanding! They were accompanied with sour cream and applesauce which added to the flavor.  I'm a real big fan of German beers so I had a couple of Dunkels which went really well with my appetizer.  When it was time to order dinner, my waiter recommended the Chicken Cordon Bleu Schnitzel which was actually pretty solid.  Later I tried a bite of the pretzel schnitzel which was even better!  At this point I'm a fan of the food and would recommend it just because of the food and German beer on tap.  The service was rather poor except for the bartender who went out of his way to make us some unusual shots.  I'm fairly confident they were spread a little thin so I would like to try them again on a weeknight or Saturday.   will definitely check them out again and will be back to try the veal schnitzel and some of the sausages.  Cool place!"}
{"text":"Sunday was my friend Dave's anniversary, sadly his wife passed away in December.  We had a memorial for her Saturday night, and Sunday Dave invited me to dinner for his anniversary, not that I'm as good looking as Kris was.  We decided on Papadeaux, but I'd forgotten that this week was Mardi Gras and they were packed.  Dave was lamenting the passing of Felsen Haus when I remembered that there's a great German restaurant in Glendale.  Having never been there before, I didn't have a clue what the name was, but Yelp, searching for German and Glendale, led me right there.  And after a quick call, we found out there was no wait and headed across town.

Dave served in the Army in Germany, and he really liked his meal.  He found the menu very impressive and enjoyed flexing his German language muscles with the staff.  His schnitzel was not the precise one he was looking for, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.

Me, I had the Tirol chicken, and was pleased.  I am anti-fungus and was able to avoid the mound placed on my plate, I should have asked if they were incorporated in what I thought was a sauce or were on the side and could have had them removed.

Sadly, I'm not a beer drinker (yet: we're going to Europe next year, that could change) and didn't have one.  Dave had a half liter of something or other and was quite pleased, said it was definitely like he had when he was based there.

Definitely recommended.  Very good food, excellent staff.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Wow Saturday is busy with Glendale Glitters.  This is our go to spot for German food.  It is fun with a great atmosphere.  The food here is worth trying.  They have great sides to go with their meals.  The chocolate sauerkraut cake is so perfect.  You should go and enjoy the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"This was my wife and I first time to eat at Hus Murphy's. She order the gouloush and I had the stuffed cabbage. I must say that I wasn't impressed. The food was bland. It tasted like it was watered down. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Given the dearth of German restaurants in the greater Phx area, this is about as good as it gets.

Had the sausage sampler.  The krakauer wurst was pretty unique.  The bratwurst was good too, but brats usually have a pretty low bar to clear to be good.

Had the Schweizer Schnitzel as a main course.  Very good.

The meal came with a cup of soup of the day, which in this case was mushroom.  Very good.

You can't eat ambiance/decor so I generally don't care about things like that but if the owners have a spare dollar or two they may want to paint the place and replace the drop ceiling.  Neither of those things will keep me away but they may want to look into those things."}
{"text":"What a fun place. I loved the vibe, music, and food. I am not usually a fan of German food but I enjoyed my Original Brat meal. The potatoes are awesome! My server was fine but he really lacked personality. The gal on the way out made up for it. She talked to me about the history of the restaurant and was most gracious! I have to say, and my friends will laugh at this comment, I enjoyed the Accordion player. He is quite good!"}
{"text":"I was not that impress maybe because I had my expectations to high. They don't have accesible parking we had to parked at the street and we were lucky and found a spot.   The service is ok I think the waitress assumes you know what the dishes are.  The food was just ok I mean it's worth to try for your self and find out if you like it or not but I don't think I'll go back for food maybe for beer or the pretzel because I couldn't try those .  I got the beef  schnitzel with paprika and it was just ok I think I rather have the country fried stake  at IHOP.  The potatoes were good though.  But just go try for your self!!"}
{"text":"I certainly don't understand the hype over this place.  That's strike 2 for you Guy Fieri (#1 is Chino Bandido, bleh).  The layout of this restaurant is very strange, but I kind of like that they separate the large groups from the smaller groups of diners.  The staff, especially our server, was extremely accommodating and put up with our certainly frustrating antics of playing board games on the dinner table.  

I was pretty hungry when we got here, so i decided to order something on the heavier side and went with the gnocchi.  The gnocchi were lightly pan fried and then drowned in a ridiculously rich cheese/cream sauce and sprinkled with chunks of pancetta and a handful of wild mushrooms.  The mushrooms tasted really weird for some reason and the sauce was too tangy.  It just didn't complement the dish the way it should have.  I did however, eat every last bit of pancetta.  Yum!  I saw a slice of German Chocolate Cake (no, it is not German in the least bit) being served to someone at another table and I gave the puppy dog eyes until we ordered it.  It came out looking rather impressive, but it went down tasting rather dull.  It was dry and lifeless and the only good part, the coconut pecan icing, was severely lacking.

Well, I won't be back here, especially after most of my companions were less than enthused with their meals instead.  Oh well, I guess that will make everyone else happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, it was worth the wait. My husband lived in Germany and I have visited on numerous occasions. The food was very authentic, loved the beers on tap! We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Love the giant pretzel and the Kilometer is my favorite dish.
  I am a huge fan of the sauerkraut and the Black forest cake as well.
The experience, however, varies greatly depending on your server.  The first time we went, our server spoke German with us and others and he made a very fun atmosphere. We shared conversation with the other diners and shared food as well.  We looked forward to going back.
 The next two times we went, both servers seemed very preoccupied, looking everywhere but at us, \"forgetting\" to bring us something, not refilling drinks.  The place wasn't busy at all, they just seemed not to care about service.
  Hubby didn't like Hackbraten and noticed that the carpets really need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"So as I am close to half German, I saw this place on Triple D on the food network, and while visiting family this summer, I talked them all in to going. we started with the sausage sampler, and the house soup that comes with the meal. mmmmmm good. My brother in law and I split the Bauernplatte - Combo for Two which has German Bratwurst, Spicy Bratwurst, Weisswurst, Kassler Kotelett and Pork Schnitzel served with Sauerkraut, Red Cabbage, German Fried Potatoes and German Potato Salad. man by the end, we were stuffed, and still had potato salad to take home. Our wives ordered Hühner (Chicken) Schnitzel, and of all things the gnocchi, which was pretty darn good. I would love to go back tho this place, the ambiance and the service were great, and the food was amazing in my opinion. 
The topper of it all was the ice cold authentic German beer on tap. 3 kinds of Spaten, Weihenstephan Hefeweizen, Warsteiner, and others. They actually have a beirgarten or beer garden to sit outside and drink in, It was summer when we went so the 109 degree heat at 7:00 kept us inside. If you are in town, give it a try, Near the Cardinals stadium, would be great for after game celebration."}
