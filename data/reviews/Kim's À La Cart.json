{"text":"I didn't have much on me at the time, so I bought fried korean rice cakes with spicy sauce on it. The best $1.50 I've ever spent on! It was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Before making it, she was even kind enough to ask me, \"Is spicy okay?\" A simple and delicious snack while waiting for the streetcar! :D Can't wait to return and try her other snacks!"}
{"text":"Don't let the semi ghetto appearance of the metal shacks throw u off.  Ms. Kim Is a super friendly Korean lady with some mad cooking skills. Everything's cooked fresh and the price is dirt cheap. Excellent price, quantity, and quality.  Authentic Korean food too!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and plentiful Korean.   I had some bulgogi with rice and some fried  pork dumplings for 7$. The sauce was sweeter than I expected...but still delicious. It was in one of those rectangular styrofoam take-out boxes and totally full. Must have been almost 2lbs of food.   They have a kimchi cucumber/pickle thing which is tasty if you're into that sort of stuff.   Nice take away!"}
{"text":"Competitively-priced Korean food! I loved their kimchee dumplings and the beef dumplings (and hard to argue with for $1 for two of them). Even better was the coffee cup of thick noodles I got for $3.50 which was truly a meal unto itself.  Cute, delicious, and a heckuva bargain!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good, and inexpensive.  This review is biased because I'm a sucker for street food."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a great place to stop by when you're just in that mood for something spicy and sweet. The prices are excellent too. They are always coming up with wonderful new menus. I can't wait to try their food again."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. No frills Korean done right. The young owner who works tirelessly in a shipping container cooking up family recipes is a boss and the Blade Runner-esque set up only adds to the charm. I go here entirely too much."}
{"text":"Minha brought us here for a late night food reunion. Love their spicy rice cakes and red bean cake"}
