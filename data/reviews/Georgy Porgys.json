{"text":"Best wings and Greek salad in the city! Newly renovated, fantastic family run business. Friendly staff. I can't get enough of this place. I heard they opened one in Richmond hill (Oak ridges) I'm going to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere. The chicken souvlaki dinner is to die for! And they have great wings. Great neighbourhood spot. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've lived next to this place for over 3 years and it wasn't until recently that I decided to try it out with a friend. It was a cold day so I ordered French onion soup. I've had enough French onion soups in my short-lived life thus far and I have a pretty solid recipe myself as well. I really don't know how you can screw up this soup but it was horrible here. It tasted like water with saut√©ed onions and mozzarella on top. I understand that this is a pub and not a French bistro, but come on...let's at least get the fundamentals of the dish right.  I also ordered their California burger with guacamole, bacon, sundried tomatoes, mayo and pepper jack cheese. Sounds good right? I thought so too. The burger was so dry and in addition to the dryness of the bun, each bite just made for a horribly dry experience even with the guac and mayo. Add more ketchup you say? I'm a bit of a burger purist and that would be against my religion. I think a burger should pretty much be able to stand out on its own. I can't say if they use freshly ground beef or not, but I doubt it. Again....fundamentals.  Service-wise, the server we had originally take our orders left sometime after serving our meals. It took quite a while to get another server to attend to us and finally get us our bill. Apparently our first server went home already as she was done for the day. Not like you need my permission to go home, but please make sure you have someone cover your tables after you leave.  Overall my experiece at GP didn't leave a good taste. Perhpaps everything would have tasted better if I had a couple of drinks...it is a pub after all. First impressions matter a lot, but I would like to give this place another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Good food and staff were friendly, the burgers are fantastic"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now twice for burgers and once for breakfast in the last 2 weeks.  I think it's very good. No complaints. The service was good and the burgers were surprisingly delicious.The fries are not frozen like so many other places and they were very good.Everything was fresh and hot so I'll be going back.  My husband had the wings and he said they were excellent.  Next time I'll try the souvlaki dinner."}
{"text":"Used to live around the corner.   I literally am sending someone there as we speak as a recommendation, so I thought I should write something about the spot!  Very solid place.  In the middle of nowhere?  I guess.  You have parking and it is right off the DVP.  The spot itself has been renovated but I kinda liked the old feel it used to have.  That said, atmosphere is like a poor man's Joey's (Don Mills/ Lawrence), much less pretentious, and guess what?  The food is pretty good there.  Try anything pub grub (fish n chips, philly cheese steak, etc), they make a point to have a solid daily special, and if you feel like really grubbing souvlaki dinner isnt bad at all.  If you feel like a solid pub, good grub, beer....and don't feel like the pretention and line up (really?) at Joey's... Go here!"}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of nowhere... just happened to be near my house!  The pasta was delicious. The burger we ordered was absolutely gigantic. The price was good. We also ordered the ice cream, it wasn't the best, but it was satisfying.  If you happen to be in the area, I highly recommend this place! I really enjoyed the food.  The server was a bit slow, but she was genuinely friendly!"}
{"text":"Georgy porgies, a community staple in my neighbourhood.  My family and I have been coming here for over ten years. It has always been a great family place to eat.  I am a creature of habit so most of the time I order the same thing. Souvlaki on a pita, with fries and a side Greek salad. The owner Chris is Greek so he knows all about Souvlaki.  Always friendly, and always good. The have done menu changes over the years adding some really good food such as Salmon , and steaks. All are great and reasonably priced. Easy parking and great service"}
{"text":"They have really good meat on their burgers and servings for everything is always generous!  It's a laid back place that's quiet and sometimes you'll see one if the owners there receiving the customers and seating them at a table. I took a star off because the place has a bit of a strange smell that might not be tolerable for some people.  Other than that,  they're great!"}
{"text":"Artichoke and spinach dip was unreal! The wings were zesty and delicious! The atmosphere was great, service great and a very nice, relaxed place. We will definitely be back for the actual game 3...urp"}
{"text":"My local watering hole. The portions are freaking huge and the food is delicious. All staff make you feel right at home, my favourite server is Holly, she is so sweet and makes you feel very welcome. Go here all the time when you want restaurant quality home cooking. You wouldn't think to go there from the outside, but its a great cozy spot."}
{"text":"Clean and friends service. We ordered 3 pounds wings and 5he artichoke dip.  Good stuff!  Leaving full and happy.  What I love about places like this is that the washrooms are on the same level and it is spacious.  Kind of a break from our usual visits to pubs and bars down danforth.  They are long and skinny establishments with sketchy uncared for washrooms in a basement. Some days...not in the mood for heels and stairs after 3 pints."}
{"text":"Georgie Porgie's is the neighborhood pub. We've been going there for many years, but have noticed that the food quality has changed, as well as the menu over the past few years. Portion sizes are still good, and prices are fair. We usually have our go to pics off the menu and have never been disappointed. It is kid friendly And never had to wait long for service. The owner is very friendly and comes around to chat and make sure everything is to our satisfaction. I would recommend this restaurant for families and value."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a social on Wednesday night.  It's your typical pub/sports bar w pub grub and alcohol found in a shopping plaza (the name slips my mind at the mo).  Service is fab - I have to give kudos to the ladies who were serving us. They were super attentive and very friendly.  Lawrence and Vic Park isn't my usual hang out, but if I'm in the area, why not?  A solid three star."}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday night for wings...got there at 1:00 am ordered the wings and happened to find one that was littered with hair, not talking about 1 or 2 hairs...but several hairs (I wish I took a picture)...the server tried to tell me that it was not hair but left over cartilage that they missed when cleaning the chicken (I didn't know cartilage looked like hair)...the shocking part to me was that she acted as if everything was cool and that I should just put it aside,only after I made enough noise, they finally decided that they would take 1 of the 2 pounds that I ordered off if the bill...if you ask me...my whole meal should have been free....seems like they need to learn a thing or two about customer service.  Not sure if this happened because I got there so late, but it is safe to say that I will never be going back. My only word of advice to anyone that orders wings from here is to make sure you inspect your food carefully as apparently \"hairy looking cartilage\" on your wings is a regular thing and not a big deal based on the reaction from the server when I brought it up and their lack of willingness to do anything about it."}
{"text":"When we first entered we were not greeted and had to wait a few min just to see an employee for seating.    I was a bit surprised at the amount of older people here so I'm thinking it is a place you can go to with a family and not have to deal with obnoxious younger party type folks. We had the artichoke dip for an app and it was very tasty. It took a while for the food to arrive but when it came we were happy. My wife and daughter got the speghetti and meat balls and they throughly enjoyed. A nice pasta sauce and the meat balls actually looked and tasted like Meat lol. I got the Buffalo chicken wrap with fries. I really, really enjoyed the fries but didn't much like the wrap. Also we were not asked if we wanted a drink top up which I found unfortunate.   I will go back but next time I will order something different."}
{"text":"This place is OK they have a beer and stein special which was good burger was bland wings were Great staff is pretty cool typical pub"}
{"text":"Most disgusting food I've eaten in my life, not to mention server ignored our table all night"}
{"text":"The place is ok, food is good but the ambiance is a bit too dark to my taste. The brunch start to late on Saturday (only at 11am)."}
{"text":"7 years ago I was involved in commercial real estate developing a retail plaza in Scarborough as well as a medical centre and on my way home I often stopped at Georgy Porgys.  I would sit on the patio and have some drafts and the waitresses were always super friendly.  When eating inside the owner always made a point of coming over and saying hi to me.  I never had a bad time here and the food was always good.  Now I am in the music promotion business with a number of bands available and hoping maybe Georgy Porgys would book a band to increase sales and bring in new customers.  Looking forward to coming back here when the cold snap breaks as I don't live nearby.  Great spot.  Trevor Jones  Barracuda Music & Talent Management.  416 221 9129."}
{"text":"I love this place and the more and more I go,  the more and more I enjoy it. Super friendly customer service, the lady that runs the place makes you feel like family, always welcomes you with open arms it makes the place extra cozy. The food is amazing, big portions and full of flavour. I've tried a number of items on the menu and have been happy with all of them ( steak sandwich, souvlaki, ribs, wings, KILLER greek salad)   I promise to take pictures next time... I always end up devouring the meal before remembering to take pictures."}
{"text":"This place has been around for around 10 years.  The food used to be pretty good, but I have to say that in the past year or two, the quality has definitely dropped.  The food used to be really fresh tasting and better than other bar food.  Now I think it has dropped to average or below average in food.  The service is OK and the atmosphere is fine.  Can't say I would recommend it though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworkers, since we work in the same plaza. Called early to order, they had our food prepared for when we asked which was nice. The restaurant is also very spacious. Apart from that, the service was sub-par. Waitresses rarely walked by to ask if we needed anything/how the food was, even though it wasn't very busy. We had to flag them down every time. The food was also sub-par. We ordered the soup of the day, a red pepper bisque, which was overloaded with salt. The chicken fajitas were just okay. Very filling though, we had lots of leftovers to bring back to our coworkers.  We've ordered takeout before and the warm chicken salad is alright.  I'd recommend this place for convenience, but if you're able to go elsewhere then do so."}
{"text":"Went back for the same friends birthday dinner a year later and my opinion stays the same. This time however I am no longer a vegan so I tried the food. I only got appetizers. It was what I expected, nothing special. I don't really fancy this place to be honest. I don't care for the food, service (wasn't bad just didn't leave mark) or the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food here and i will definitely come back. You know sometimes when you order a bunch of food, some of them are better than the other and overwhelm the taste. But all the food we order stands out in its own with unique flavour."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and the food was great.  However quality is taking a hit with the corners that are being cut; smaller wing size, less wings per \"pound\" and inconsistencies with food.  (Wings are getting drier and drier when they used to be saucy, greek rice with dinner wasn't cooked properly last time, fries are sometimes stale, etc.)  This used to be my watering hole but I am now searching for a new one."}
{"text":"I love this place!  the food is typical pub fare but I LOVE their souvlaki dishes.  We have had our engagement party there and our nephew has had his baptism party there.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Back to the souvlaki dishes.  I can tell you that they rival any place on the Danforth, and the secret is all the stuff that comes with it.  The rice and roast are perfectly seasoned and the salad has a dressing to die for!  It is so addictive I sometimes just go to eat their Greek salad."}
{"text":"Ordered a philly cheese steak and my picture shows little steak.  Not worth 14$   This was upsetting for me I was looking forward to trying food for here but a basic favourite with little meat I wonder what else they cheap out on???"}
{"text":"We go here almost monthly. The souvlaki is one of the best north of the danforth. The wings are great too. Watch for groupons and specials. The sandwiches and burgers are very good too. Greek family run and the service is always good. Check it out next time you are at the Scarborough and north York boarder."}
{"text":"Went there from the request of one of my friends. He went there years ago and has never forgotten the wings. The place is frankly in the middle of no where right next to some traintracks. The place feels like a slightly run down version of a jack astors or milestones. However, once we got seated, the staff was very friendly and the food (wings) was amazing! I highly recommend the wings. They are about 8 different flavours but they do a great job of each."}
