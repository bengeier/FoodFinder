{"text":"This neighborhood is in dire need of fantastic pizza, and especially good slices. Everything I've had so far has been fantastic. The crust has a perfect crunchy chew and the tomato sauce is rich and fresh (not to mention the endless amount of choices he offers).   I have embarrassingly eaten late nights (or early morning) here for about 5 years. I'm a sucker man when it comes to local pizza joints, but what I can definitely assert is that this is some damn tasty pizza. With an opulent number of choices in sauces at a super discounted price, it fills a necessary void for an affordable lunch that some newer Crescent restaurants have been missing. This place is great for the *entire* neighborhood.  What I recommend: Meat-Lover!  10/10 would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Wow! Got the munchies for an amazing slice of pizza after a nice \"5 a 7\", later...or even very early in the morning after a couple of drinks? You have got to go to Montreal Pizzeria!!! Hot out of the oven, always fresh, plenty of choices...and the prices! Starting at 0.99$!!! Plus, great, friendly staff."}
