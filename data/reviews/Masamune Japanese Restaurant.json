{"text":"Pleasant service and good food. The iceberg lettuce salad was a bit bland but the rest of the meal shined. The miso soup was tasty. The volcano roll was brimming with flavour and texture. Prices were good for what you get. Would recommend for a causal sushi dinner."}
{"text":"This is a hidden sushi gem.  Although located in an industrial area the decor is pleasant and makes you forget what part of the city you are in.  The fish is full of flavour on a bed of expertly prepared rice.  The ratio of fish to rice is great on the sushi and the maki rolls are beautiful and tasty.  Service was friendly and efficient but can be a bit slow at times. Great place definite must try."}
{"text":"I have been here two times now, and I have really enjoyed it. Everything tasted great and came out at a reasonable time. I am looking forward for the next time I can go! I will definately try some mire things from their menu.

I havent had their sushi yet, however ny friend got a handroll which she enjoyed and said it was very fresh. 

They were busy, and the server couldnt spend that much time with me, but next time I will ask for a reccomendation."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have only been here for lunch before as I work close by. Their lunch menu has lots of great deals and always comes out with great quality consistently. They are generous with their portion sizes and seafood, you won't find sushi here that is almost all rice with a tiny sliver of fish. 

Only negative comment is that they are a little slow even when the restaurant seems half full. So I wouldn't go here if I was in a rush."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh, great sushi, good atmosphere. My only complaint would be that compared to other sushi places I've been in the Mississauga area, it's slightly overpriced. Especially for things like miso soup which I believe was 3$ or more for a cup. My favorite sushi place serves miso soup for .50 cents a cup. Nevertheless, I would return."}
{"text":"Average service and decor. 
Prices fair
Sashimi average or slightly below
Wonton soup very good - homemade throughout. That may be promising for some of the non Japanese dishes i didn't try"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi with great service. Reasonable prices too and the lunch menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the service is good too. The best japanese food I have had so far at this price point."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch. Amazing! Friendly service and the freshest sushi I've had in a long time! The server forgot the sushi pizza but we were satisfied between the two rolls/edamame/miso soup + salad. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"I work in the area so I always get take out. On the rare occasions that my order isn't ready when I go to pick up. The staff always offers me a seat by the sushi counter, so I can literally see my order being made with a complementary cup of green tea. 

The rolls are to die for! My favorites are the spicy tuna and caterpillar!! Never had a bad experience and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, and a big fan of veggie sushi - so I can't say anything about the fish, but I really enjoyed this place.
I got take-out - the restaurant is small and not much to look at - however the food was very good.
I got a cucumber roll, avacado roll, yam roll. They were all very good, and nice and fresh.
I do think its a little on the pricey side - however I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT sushi! Fresh, made to order, and the seaweed is actually CRISPY! If there's one thing I can't stand, it's eating a hand roll that has soggy stale seaweed wrapped around it. I like to feel crunch with my roll....I don't like having to pull/rip seaweed apart with my teeth, looking like a fool in the process.

The terriyaki dishes are quite tasty, served with a little bowl of steamed rice. To be fair I have experienced inconsistency with the dish. One time I had shrimp terriyaki which came with a plethora of vegetables. The second time, it only came with cabbage. I guess they ran out of veggies.

Anyway, this place rocks for sushi. It's pricey, but well worth it if you like freshness. The dynamite roll always has a hot piece of shrimp tempura in the middle, so you know it was just cooked :)"}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVOURITE sushi spot in Mississauga! I'm definitely no longer a fan of AYCE sushi, since I always tend to overeat and become uncomfortable. Although Masamune is not an AYCE sushi restaurant, I always leave satisfied and paying a reasonable amount for good quality sushi. Many times the price I pay at Masamune ends up being cheaper than an AYCE. When I come here for two people (myself and another), we usually order a roll and two special rolls (special rolls come with a salad and a miso soup) and we are happy. 

I am in LOVE with their sushi rolls. So far, I haven't tasted a bad roll here. However, my go-to rolls would be: Spicy Salmon roll and Volcano Roll. The Volcano roll is AMAZING! Savory and crispy all in one. 

This restaurant is located in a more quiet area and I noticed many business workers visit. However, I actually prefer that it's less busy and calmer than other places as I can eat my food in comfort. 

I DEFINITELY recommend coming to Masamune for some tasty sushi. Service is fast and sushi is AWESOME! This place is underrated!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Came after their break (3pm-4pm) and was promptly greeted by the very nice hostess when I came through the door. Ordered the red dragon roll and avocado roll, and it was all very delicious! Quality is great, much better than what I had in other sauga sushi joints. The rice ratio is just right, and I left feeling refreshed. As far as presentation goes, the restaurant has a great atmosphere, much better than any that I've been to yet, even the ones in Toronto. Will definitely come back.

ps. this place is slightly pricier than what I'm used to, since I usually go to AYCE joints in Toronto/Mississauga. My bill came to a little under $24 after tax and tip. Next time, I think I'll bring a group of friends and order a party tray, seeing that will be more cost-friendly with my student budget."}
{"text":"The waitress was really friendly.  She greeted me, found me a table, immediately brought me tea and 5 minutes later brought me my order.  While the customer service was great, the food was not.  I ordered the spicy salmon maki and was not impressed when I saw what was on the plate - disappointing miniature serving size.  Six tiny rolls and the thinnest rolls I've ever seen.  Tasted great but for the price I paid, I expected far more. Ton of other better places around.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"My first visit was a couple months ago for lunch, came here through a recommendation. Nice decor, love their dinnerware, good tea. Their menu seems like a 50/50 mix of Japanese and Korean dishes. I find that the location is a bit awkward because it's tucked away in this industrial plaza, but still right off Dixie. They also have the sit-in private rooms for parties, which I made a note to ask for next time I bring a party.

First visit, service was good (mind you we were the only table there ~2pm) therefore everything came out prompt and fresh. No complaints.

Second visit was today and it was packed for lunch! (12pm) Service was a little slower and unfortunately we were on a tighter schedule today. I noticed a lot of Korean patrons, which translates to me as this place serves good authentic food. 
Bf ordered the kalbi bento box, I ordered the bulgogi bento box with an order or salmon sashimi on the side (of course). Everything was good for the most part, and seasoned well. The only complaint I have was that the bulgogi was a bit clumped together and I asked to remind the server about the salmon order. All in all still good!"}
{"text":"This place arguable has the best rolled, freshest sushi i have eaten.

Every time I am in town I stop here and it never disappoints.

It is a Japanese/Korean restaurant.

First - Sushi
The ingredients are always fresh, cut to perfection.  It takes time to get this sushi and it is well worth it.  You can tell the Sushi Chefs are well trained and take a lot of pride in the product that they put out.

Korean Food
From what I have tried over my last couple of visits, its great.  The Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop was both fresh, spicy and savory.  Nothing beats the stone pot crispiness of the rice at the end.  The key is to make sure you do not stir or agitate the rice that is against the edge of the bowl until the end.

I recommend this place to everyone I know that is going to or Toronto.

I am going back in a couple of weeks and I am thinking about booking a hotel in the area.  Main reason being, Masamune!!"}
{"text":"Little gem out by the airport in a depressing strip.  But I mean, that's all it is out by Pearson, depressing strips.  Been twice, both times liked my my sushi box lunch, good tempura, not to oily, the sushi is served at the right temp, cuts are good and service is great."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of the Best Sushi Restaurant in the Great Toronto Area!!! I have been to a lot of sushi restaurants and I can say this place serves the freshest  Sushi! It just melts in your mouth! The serving is quite plenty!  The service at Masamune was amazing! Service was quick and they are very friendly and helpful with the menu! The ambiance is very quiet and serene. The decor has this 1980's Japanese feel and its Awesome!!! Don't forget to try their Black Sesame Ice Cream its Yummmmy!! By the way their soy sauce is so light and its a little sweet so it compliments the sushi instead of overpowering it!"}
{"text":"Masamune has become one of our go-tos in Mississauga. It's either masamune or niwa sushi in Oakville. 

The private tatami seating is very nice when you come here with a group. The sushi rolls are creative and delicious. We always order a big sashimi / sushi boat to share. If you crave more unique things like uni sea urchin and Amaebi jumbo sweet shrimp, masamune usually carries them. And they have always been really fresh. The Amaebi is served two ways - sashimi body and then the heads are deep fried! 

The down side is that they only have 2-3 servers and the place does get busy so sometimes they are not as attentive with refilling tea and checking on you."}
{"text":"The 30$ chef choice of sushi should be the sushiA dinner it's nothing special just over priced average sushi 12pieces is like 25$-.-"}
{"text":"Simple and not expensive. The decor could do with an upgrade but hey ... I was there for the food"}
{"text":"I got it to go.  Nice looking place.  I had the spicy tuna roll, a cucumber roll and  salmon sushi pieces.  They were very fresh and really good.  The salmon pieces were a bit larger than usual.  Not overly huge but bigger.  Very fresh.  I am away on biz and had sushi somewhere else last night.  It was decent but not good enough to make me not want to try another place.  If I am in the mood for sushi again tomorrow, I will go back (I know...3 days in a row?  Let's say I'm in the mood) .  

Good stuff.  

Not the greatest looking place from the outside but pretty darn good as far as quality."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  Couldn't even eat half of it. Agadashe tofu was gross, smothered in teriyaki sauce. Toro was chewy, couldn't even swallow it. Asked server to not charge me for Toro but she did anyway!! She told me she had to... What??!!! I should have just eaten at a dirty Chinese restaurant, would have been better than this crap Japanese!  Shame on this place"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it was bad, but certainly anti-climatic. 

Being in Mississauga, we don't have a grove of fine sushi options, ayce or a la carte, compared to the east end. 
Lately I've been on the the lookout for GOOOOOOOD non-ayce sushi joints, to sedate my cravings, instead of running to ayce and feeing guilty afterwards. 
That being said, out of the options, Masamune finds itself riiiiight in the middle. 

I see all the raving reviews, but to me it was meh. Nothing over-the-top, nothing outstanding, nothing that sets it apart, nothing to make to 'better' than others or 'best'. 


TDLR;
- Points of cleanliness
- decent sized rolls
- way up on the pricier side
- chewy overcooked lobster (in the speciality roll)
- basic maki rolls were ayce quality
- spicy tuna/spicy salmon/spicy scallop roll had specks of fish.. Overwhelmed by 80% tempura crisp."}
{"text":"Looked like your standard Japanese sushi restaurant but the food was not very good. I ordered a Korean dish bulgogi which was probably not a good idea. The beef is supposed to be thin and it was very thick and not very tender. The other dishes we ordered look like they came from a standard Chinese restaurant. Food was not terrible but definitely lacked any real creativity."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Sushi spot in Mississauga. Good value too."}
{"text":"The sushi is of good quality, but expensive after their lunch special is over at 3pm. The salmon and eel sushi is my favorite here. I sometimes go here for lunch with friends and/or clients, and I have no complaints. This place has the typical Japanese restaurant look with the dojo dividers between the booths, etc. My main complaint is that they do not offer and all you can eat menu, which may also be a good thing as the prevents overeating."}
{"text":"A pretty big restaurant, Korean Japanese, Good lunch, the soba dipping sauce is a bit too sweet for my taste.  Rolls are nicely done."}
{"text":"The entire experience was unexpected. Slightly hard to find in a plaza just off a very busy street. Once we found the restaurant, the interior was spotless. Everything was well kept and clean. The waitress greeted us with a huge smile. 

Looking at the menu, there was an eclectic mix of Korean, Japanese, and sushi. I tried a Korean soup (they mean spicy, by the way) which was excellent. The portions were generous, and the food exceptionally well prepared. It took a little longer than I expected, but it was freshly made. The soup came out still boiling slightly. 

At the end of the meal, my wife and I ordered take out sushi for later in the evening. The waitress apologized that the rolls we ordered would take about 15 minutes and brought us tea to ease our wait at no charge. 

All in all, an excellent experience for an unassuming restaurant. Whenever I am in Mississauga, I will be eating here!"}
{"text":"- fairly average spot in an industrial part of dixie and eg, but considering it's dixie and eg, good japanese joints are pretty far and few between.
- decent dolsot bibimbap (i think this place is run by koreans)."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. In. GTA.

Hands down some of the freshest sushi in the city. Bento boxes aren't bad. Spicy rolls are really good. P

Do and will continue going back even though prices aren't the friendliest."}
{"text":"This place is very cozy and a nice restaurant to sit at for dinner. We came in here expecting it to be decent, but is was much better than we expected! Would come back here again. Both the Sushi, Bento and Korean food is amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was very poor! We got the Maki dinner platter and it was better than the average. The service here was terrible! We got seated at the back of the restaraunt and there was no server to be found! We literally had to get up and flag down someone to get water, to order, to get more ginger, and to get the bill. The service may be better at the front of the restaraunt."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! I have never been to a restaurant like this before so it was quite the experience. I would have given this restaurant 4 stars but I will be going with 2.5 because the food took way too long to come out. Like upwards of 45mins.

Either way, I enjoyed the dish I got (it was a Korean dish - don't quite remember the name) which came out with miso soup. Yummy. The people were polite and the inside of the restaurant was kept clean. 

Overall, I would probably give this place another try and see if their service time improves, but until then I can't really recommend it to a friend since waiting that long for your food (even at lunch time..) isn't reasonable or acceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped in here due to the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  The sushi was excellent. Had a few rolls and hand rolls.
The price was very good, considering both the quality of the sushi and the amount of actual fish provided in each roll."}
{"text":"Very good sushi place, also has good selection of Korean food. Went there twice for lunch and both experience were good. I did not order anything fancy, just items from lunch menu, sashimi box was pretty good for lunch size."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great service!
A good range of fresh and tasty Sushi
Clean and great atmosphere
Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Food here was good.    Price was on the high end. Pricing was very comparable to AYCE.  We ordered a sushi combo and shared it.  It came with miso soup and salad.  I would probably recommend them drop their prices to stay competitive with other sushi places.  Other than that it was a pleasing family get together for us."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but it has one of the worst service ever! The waitress was holding the chopstick paper wrapper to trash it, but when she stopped at our table because we asked for water, she accidently dropped a piece in our miso soup. She saw it, didn't apologize, didn't offer to replace the soup, and just walked away. She didn't even bring the water. We had to ask a different waitress."}
{"text":"Very peaceful and pleasant place! The food is very fresh and delicious. We wanna come back and try more kinds in the future."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Japanese restaurant in Mississauga. From the outside you will be deceived. The real treat is in the food. 
I took my Japanese boss here on several occasions and he loved it! So do I. The bento box just keeps me wanting more more more, but I always get extra miso soup. The girls in my office don't care too much for tofu. My luck!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner tonight and it was fresh and tasty and the staff was very friendly and prompt. I have no complaints except that I ordered too much food ;)  I would recommend trying the sushi pizza cause it was unique and yummy! (and I'll add again .. filling)."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in late at around 920. we were seated down nicely. 5 min later we were informed that the sushi bar is closed however the kitchen is open still. We had our heart set on sushi so we left. what saved this place is the customer service. the hostess was very polite in explaining what happened and was very respectful. That counts a lot. I will be back just because of her."}
{"text":"From the outside it may look like nothing special, but inside the restaurant is clean and well decorated. Sat at the sushi bar, had spicy tuna, salmon nigiri, a special roll with avocado, and some very nice cold Sake to wash it all down.    Waitress was very nice, and nothing beats sitting at the sushi bar watching the chef's as they create great food. (good prices too!)"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese food restaurant for me in Mississauga near Dixie and 401 area.  The staffs are friendly, the food is excellent, the store is clean and tidy.  Lunch hours are very busy Monday to Friday.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious, nicely rolled and very fresh sushi. Every time we've gone the service has been quick and the servers friendly. Their spicy scallop hand roll is to die for. I also love their red and green dragon rolls. the volcano roll is yummy, too. Best sushi in Mississauga without question. Cant wait to go back and try the lobster roll."}
{"text":"This place is nice (in Mississauga). The place to go when you don't want to drive to Toronto/want to have sushi for workday lunch."}
{"text":"The yam tempura (sweet potato tempura) was really good!

Had the Chicken Katsu Donburi"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked because I saw that they had sushi pizza and oh boy do I love sushi pizza! The restaurant is in a very unassuming area, and looks quite small on the outside. They do have a few private rooms that looked nice for a party. 
I was super impressed and elated that they did a few modifications for me since I don't eat fish or meat. They made the sushi pizza without fish and it was fantastic, the crust was like a tempura crust and lots of avocado on top. They did the caterpillar roll for us with tempura yam instead of seafood and oh my gosh it was amazing. We also got the yam rolls and the broccoli rolls, both A+ 
Sometimes it is hard to get good veggie sushi, so when a place is willing to make a few simple changes it goes a long way. The rolls were so fresh and the staff was so accommodating that I would certainly recommend it and will be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the unassuming facade scare you away.  Truly a delectable meal; very fresh, very authentic."}
{"text":"I've been here both for lunch and dinner.
Both times were very good.  Its usually not packed so no need to wait for a table.  

We got to sit in one of their private sunken table rooms which was really nice.  The seats were comfortable and the atmosphere was great.  Service was good and the sushi tasted fresh.  We ordered the making platter and a extra volcano roll to share with three people.  The rolls were huge and definitely tasty and filling.

The only downside was that it took quite awhile to get our food.  Our friend almost finished his soba noodles by the time our rolls came.  Other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Definitely on the top of my list for a sushi meal in the west end. I went for the lunch sushi-sashimi combo. Good, fresh fish, and they were very willing to sub the dreaded \"white tuna\" with another cut. 

The miso was nice and subtle, not too salty. In and out in no time thanks to the efficient servers. This is \"detour worthy\" if I'm even remotely nearby."}
{"text":"The chef accommodate my request of hand roll. It was perfect!

I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day...had a craving for sushi, but when I got there, I decided on the Dolsot Bim Bim Bop...yum!  I think I arrived just a little after the lunch time rush, because the Bim Bim Bop came out a little early...so the rice didn't get as crispy as I like.  But it was still tasty.  I've had some of their rolls here before, and they're also quite yummy.  I'd visit again :)"}
{"text":"So happy to find excellent sushi before flying out of Toronto. I found this on yelp..thankyou..so many delicious sounding rolls I would have loved to try..but being alone..my stomach is only so big.
Tried the yam roll..unagi and salmon sushi.service was good despite it getting very busy at 530 pm"}
{"text":"Maybe it's was an off day, and maybe I'm a bit picky, but I've had far better Japanese food in places more far flung that Mississauga.  Service was haughty, borderline indifferent and rude, and the food was at best mediocre.

We both had the sashimi bento with tempura, and the shrimp was stingy.  The sashimi was poorly sliced and definitely a long way away from what would normally be served as sashimi grade -- this tuna was probably better served chopped into a spicy tuna roll.  Miso soup was meh at best.

I don't particularly like giving mediocre reviews, but I think the restaurant could care a bit more about the food they serve and the way it's delivered."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's a quiet Japanese restaurant in a strip plaza, definitely a hidden gem. It's small, so I would suggest making a reservation if you want your own private booth. 
The customer service was great and the food was amazing and the portion sizes were generous. 
Went with family last weekend and I just made reservation for this weekend to go with some girlfriends. 
The sushi and udon noodles were my fave!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is good.... the guys behind the sushi bar could be friendlier though...quietest shushing bar I have ever been in.
However, a few things... the front entrance is a mess... should do a better job with getting property manager to clean up the parking area... normally I would drive away, but I am always a bit adventurous.
Even when I asked 'why so quiet' they just shrugged.... could not get them to take order without having the attendant take it?
Please if you go, the food is good.... but...!"}
{"text":"good service, fresh fish, nice atmosphere, far from a city, i'll go there again for sure if i travel here again."}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE sushi place! The food is DELICIOUS, fresh and there's a lot of variety! It's not an all you can eat but that's where the freshness comes from! The atmosphere is so calm and seating is very authentically placed with private and party rooms!"}
{"text":"A solid choice for sushi in the area!  Too bad it's not in an area that's frequent to me.

Location:  In a one-storey strip mall located along an industrial/commercial strip of Dixie.  There are a lot of Middle Easter and chain restaurants in the area, located in a similar setting.

Atmosphere:  Medium sized.  You can either sit at a table or in a Tatami.  No booths.  Tatamis are probably better for groups larger than 4ppl.

Service:  Not super attentive/friend, but just enough.

Food was decent from the fried gyoza, calamari, maki platter, & sashimi platter that we ordered.  I noticed that the knife work was very good.  Sashimi pieces are slightly smaller than most places, but the fish did taste fresh.  Menu also had Korean items, so it's a good selection.

I'd be open to going back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi place.

Ordered the Gyoza, Dynamite and Green Dragon rolls, all delicious.

They have seating for 6+ people in the back in private rooms. 

When arrived with a busy 18mo toddler, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. 

Will def be back"}
{"text":"I loved it... The only reason I can't give 5 stars is like most sushi places they serve Escolar and call it White Tuna which I think the Canadian Food Inspection Agency should be cracking down on more. Google escolar if you don't believe me. 
Either way... Everything else I had there is amazing and it is the best sushi in Mississauga.
I also want to point out that cheap food is rarely good food. I don't understand why anyone would want cheap raw seafood. Of course AYCE places are cheaper... The sushi is also disgusting. Even if it isn't gross it still isn't as good. 
You pay for quality and this place was not much more expensive and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Our department at work goes out for lunch each Friday. A few weeks back, we went to Masamune for lunch. 

The restaurant is roughly a seven-minute drive from my workplace. I drove a bunch of us over there. There is a decent amount of parking in this plaza.

I like the restaurant's interior. You have the option of sitting at tables with chairs, or you can eat in a traditional low table with a sunken floor. We went with the former. However, we want to give the latter a try! 

The restaurant is deep and spacious. We sat practically at the very back of the restaurant. We were a party of eight.

I wanted tempura. I didn't know whether getting the sushi and teriyaki bento box would be too much food for me. Instead, I skipped the sushi part and went with the chicken teriyaki bento box. This lunch special came with salad, miso soup, both shrimp and vegetable tempura, chicken teriyaki and rice.

I liked everything! The miso soup was perfect. The salad dressing wasn't overpowering, but it was the right amount of flavour over the crisp salad. The rice and chicken teriyaki complemented each other. The tempura was yummy.

My longest-serving student taught me how to fold a chopsticks stand using the paper wrapper of my chopsticks. Ah, good bonding times with origami!

I want to come back here to try more food, especially the sushi. I enjoyed my food. Service was fast and the servers were courteous to our entire group.

(156)"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had. The rice is very sticky and the fish isn't the freshest. The staff are like robots and never make eye contact until you're paying you bill. 
I didn't like being seated at a dirty table with soya sauce at it. 
Avoid this place if you can. If you're desperate and in the array, it'll suffice."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Japanese restaurant.  Waitress was very nice, smiled, and patient while we ordered.   She repeated back the entire order. Food was good and I discovered I like quite a few new foods. 
If I'm in the area I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I don't normally give 5 Stars, but this place is really quiet a find in amongst the plethora of AYCE places here in Ontario - of which by nature are not able to offer the higher quality of an 'normal' restaurant.

To reiterate: this is NOT an AYCE place!

The food is very fresh and fast. The sushi (rice) is fresh, as are the ingredients and the various rolls and Sashimi are bursting with flavor. And they don't use tempura flakes as filler as is common up here.

I also had a Salmon laid on a bed of bed of vegetables. I ate it all it was that good.

This is a very nice sit-down restaurant with fast, efficient service which is at the perfect attention level. You won't have dishes piling up, or empty drink glasses, be neither will you have a hovering wait-person.

I'm summation: Masamune is well worth the trip, even if you must drive an hour or two. (I myself am an hour+ down in Waterloo) I'm coming back here absolutely.

Based on the quality of this place, it probably gets crowded, so you may want to call ahead."}
{"text":"I can now declare this as the best sushi I've tried in Mississauga (emphasis on Mississauga, as I have had better outside of this town).
I chose this restaurant since this was ranked 2nd best sushi spot in the location. I initially went to the restaurant that was ranked 1st position, but since I didn't make a reservation, and it was Friday night, and it was a fairly tiny restaurant, I did not get a table. 
Masamune has a very traditional decor, and has only like 5 tables by the entrance that can sit a max of 4 people. Apart from these tables all they have are tables by the sushi bar and private dining rooms that are meant for larger groups and have those traditional low floor chairs. 
We luckily got the last table from those 5 by the entrance, which was a relief as I was in no mood for searching for an alternative restaurant following rejection from the previous.
Our server was very friendly and gave us hot tea immediately. The prices here were a bit steep from other sushi places in the area that I've been to. I also noticed that the crowd had many Japanese groups, which would suggest authentic food should be served.
I was craving for a selection of maki and sushi, which they had but was too large for one person, so they happily accommodated me by replacing some of the rolls with vegetarian ones so that my vegetarian brother could share with me. This I really appreciated.
My brother got the vegetarian soba noodles, which come in a broth, and they were courteous enough to come back and warn us that the broth contains fish flakes- another bonus.
The food took some time to arrive, but when it finally came it did not disappoint. I could tell that the sushi was the best quality because there was not too much rice and from my experience after eating at Hiro Sushi, I learned that traditional sushi should have just a bit of rice, while the fish on top should have a longer 'tail'. This is exactly how the sushi was here. It almost replicated the sushi from Hiro Sushi. 
The last piece of sushi was the one that made me realize that they do serve quality, as they gave me one sushi that consisted of the fatty tuna, which literally melted in my mouth. It was divine.
The soba noodles was served piping hot and according to my brother it was good, but he still prefers ramen rather than soba noodles, so I can't really say much on that.
From now on this restaurant is on my top list of sushi joints in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Everything here was pretty good except for that awful salad. You can't have everything! The maki dinner combo was full of well-made maki sushi. My only complaint is that everything was kind of small. I got to sample some of the rainbow roll, which was also tasty. Lastly, the jap chae appetizer was huge and delicious! 

I wouldn't say the sushi is the best in Mississauga but it's definitely in my top 5. The prices of their special rolls are a bit high."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  The best part was..SUSHI! Very delicious and super fresh! Big fan:) however they are quite overpriced in my opinion. Might go again for sushi only."}
{"text":"One of my favorite east Mississauga Japanese restaurants by far. Although I come mainly for the sushi it's really much more than that and offers the classic floor seating tables in private rooms for small groups.

The sushi tastes fresh and the staff are welcoming..i enjoy the selection on the menu and even when busy they often have a seat at the chefs sushi bar for those like me lunching alone. 

My signal complaint would have to be the prices which are not competitive with similar restaurants in the area.

But overall enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Pretty average and decent sushi spot - but wait what? It's located in Mississauga?! Options are limited in this area and so this would be a pretty good option for a sit-down lunch!

Located in a tiny plaza, the interior is pretty well kept and spacious. I was surprised to see how busy this place was on a weekday but figures, a lot of coworkers and colleagues were here for a nice lunch away from the office.

Not necessary to make reservations however the parking lot did fill up fast. Service was very inattentive and we had to flag down waitresses several times before we were able to place our order (you can pretty much throw away the idea of having your cup of tea refilled - I'd ask the waitress to leave the whole teapot at the table next time) - but they were quick to grab us our bills though!

They have daily bento box specials (~$12) which were nice but didn't seem filling enough for me so I grabbed the L07 Bento Box for $15.95 - teriyaki chicken with rice, 6pc California roll, 5pc tempura, miso soup, salad, and the side dish of the day (which was 2pc deep fried tofu).
Sushi was very mediocre and the tempura was drowning in oil... however, the chicken teriyaki was actually really good. It was nicely grilled and wasn't dry as what you might get elsewhere. However, the teriyaki sauce was a bit off. Overall, it was alright - not the best, but for the location and price point and all that you're getting, it was decent and good enough to fill you up for a regular lunch.

Would probably come back for many more office lunches but would shy away from their sushi & tempura - I'd stick to their rice and meat dishes. I also saw a few private rooms that were set to resemble traditional Japanese dining rooms which would also be a good choice for those looking for a special work occasion lunch!

See how I'm mentioning lunch so many times? I really don't think you'd want to come here for a lovely dinner date or anything of that sorts."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place! Always drove by but never went... until last weekend for the first time with 4 other friends for lunch on Saturday.

ATMOSPHERE: Big dining room, and with a number of smaller private dining rooms with sunken seating to provide a different experience. 

I love the hilarious cat posters where a cat is dressed up in Japanese costume and scenarios. Complete random, but entertaining.

SERVICE: Good service. Very accommodating to our group of 5 people. Since it was a Saturday afternoon, it had steady flow of diners, and so sometimes the service was not as quick, but overall very receptive to requests & needs.

PRICE: Average. As expected for such a bubble tea restaurant.

FOOD: I agree with the other reviews that their sushi pizza, and rolls are good. The sushi pizza, unexpectedly, has a lot of avocado on it - which was a nice surprise. It made for a great mix of textures - which is what I like in a sushi pizza.

For rolls, we had the Lobster Roll (it tasted good but couldn't really taste the lobster well...) and the Giant Dragon Roll (the better of the 2 rolls for sure). I'd like to come back and try the other rolls!

We also got two another appetizers: the grilled calamari and the kalbi. I didn't get to sample the kalbi (it only had 3 pieces and there were 5 of us), but the grilled calamari was great! Highly recommend that calamari: the texture was nice (dense but not too chewy) and had a tasty teriyaki sauce. The portion was also fair.

And finally, we shared the medium sashimi platter/boat. It had all the standard fish on it. Everything was good. Not amazing like Hinote or other fancier places in Toronto. But I'd choose this place over other Mississauga options like Sushi Tei.

This is super close to a frequent destination - so I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We were a group of three. We ordered the tempura, sushi and teriyaki noodles. The tempura was very fresh and crispy 
, plus the sauce that came with it was infused with a delicious aroma! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Terrific bento boxes for lunch, even if it is a little on the pricy side! I'm a total sucker for good tempura and Masumune has GREAT tempura - fried, flaky perfection."}
