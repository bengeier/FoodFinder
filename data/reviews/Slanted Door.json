{"text":"Exactly what I needed on a cold rainy day: a medium latte with almond milk. Slanted Door incorporates local artists' work with the chill, fun, and social environment of a coffee shop. With large beautiful art work displayed on all walls, I was wondering about their coffee. And it definitely does not upset! The medium cup (in house) was way larger than I expected and most coffee shops sell lattes for this price ~$5 in a rather small cup. Super smooth latte, great service, large space, and delicious coffee! Plus the succulents are so cute and that's an added bonus!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Was walking though the Annex when I saw Slanted Door. I popped in for a coffee and was pleasantly surprised. The coffee they use has great flavour and you can actually taste a difference from the typical other vendors. The decor and art make the space very nice to sit and just enjoy your coffee.  Went back again the next day and got a chai latte. Probably the best chai latte I've found in Toronto! They make their syrup in-house and it has such a good and bold flavour. It's also not too sweet which is great. Found my new go-to cafe!"}
{"text":"Very spacious and sunny, with cool Art all around, and a small gallery in the basement.   The music they play is your standard pop music, and the coffee is meh at best."}
