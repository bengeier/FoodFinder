{"text":"I visited Rio Bar & Grill for the first time on a Saturday night. The cover charge was $10 per person, and there was a $2 coat check charge. A sign displayed inside the entrance of the establishment stated that there was a dress code in effect. When I asked about this, I was told that there were no sandals or short pants allowed. We arrived at 9:45 p.m. but the live music did not start until after 10:00 p.m. I ordered a sangria and it was quite pricey, at $11 for an average sized glass. Overall, overpriced for drinks but a fun place to dance salsa."}
{"text":"Great find for latin dancing on a Saturday night but definitely eat first before heading down. Food is barely edible...skip the steak strip appetizer for certain!!!! Revolting is the only word that comes to mind and i tend to be forgiving. I mentioned this bar to a coworker who advised how ill she became after ordering a Monte Cristo sandwich one lunch hour. As entertaining as this bar is to go to I really must say...stick to music and close down your kitchen. The 'chef' should be ashamed."}
{"text":"A good place to discover for latino music dance on friday/saturday nights.  Like 10$ cover. 2$ coat check. Start at 9pm?
Live band!

Now you know. Go dance salsa! 
Note: bring cash
Downside: no mojito!!"}
