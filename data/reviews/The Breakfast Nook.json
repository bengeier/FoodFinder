{"text":"Wonderful-took my adult family members for breakfast. The service was friendly, accommodating, and felt like a family. We ordered the cowgirl, eggs benedict, grilled cheese and veggie omelet. Food was equivalent to Butterfields (one of my favs), fresh and savory. Well worth the money-service could not get any better. Love this place."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much--was reticent to try the place. And I was dead wrong. The food here was so frickin flavorful fresh and delicious! Definitely worth a stop on your ride through to Cave Creek, Lake Pleasant and beyond. Reasonable prices were a bonus!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. Family owned and local. Food was ok once we got it. Service was really slow. We waited about 15minuets for our table, which is understandable. We then waited 10-15 to order and another 30 minutes for our food. It seems that they don't know how to run a busy restaurant. Hope that things improve soon. 

For our money, there are better ran local establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Waited about 30 mins for breakfast seating.  Food was good, but service was definately lacking.  Hope things improve."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, great food. Old school \"family style and feel\" when you walk in. Don't expect the Henry environment or First Watch decor but you won't be disappointed with the meal. -DEFINITELY RECOMMEND-"}
{"text":"Great Menu for this family owned business.  Coffee is great, portions are excellent and very tasty.  This new little restaurant which has a great location and  is worth a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"What a great place! Food is fantastic and the service is great. Loved everything I've eaten there. Everyone should try this place if you have a chance."}
{"text":"What a great find! We walked right in Saturday morning and enjoyed friendly service from everyone there and delicious food!!! I had coffee & the cowgirl breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage and french toast. It was perfect! Eggs were fluffy and light, sausage was appropriately spicy and french toast was simply to die for. Oh and lets not forget the coffee!!! Mmmm! Very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great Eggs! Great cooked to order! Love that they can make basted eggs medium well. Great attentive staff,  super menu, constant coffee refills. We were referred here by friends, so we stopped by after Mass at St. Gabes! We will be back.  Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The family and I rode our bikes to enjoy another  great meal at the Breakfast Nook.  Favorites are quickly becoming the Eggs Benedict, Skillets and the Biscuits and Gravy.  Great flavor in  the homemade sauces and gravy.  TBN is a family owned business with a kind and attentive staff.  Very kid friendly."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time back and will probably be my last. I ordered the meat lover omelette, small bowl of fruit and a English muffin. Also had a orange juice and ice tea. The omelette was very thin and plain I didn't like the choice of fruit in the fruit bowl. Would of preferred some strawberries and grapes maybe some watermelon. 

But what bothered me the most that the place was dirty. My table had to wiped down after I set down. The booth next me had catchup on the seat, the booth in front of me looked like something had been spilled on the seat and never wiped up. We're the guy sets and rolls silverware the window was cover in finger prints.  Then at the very end I went to pay my bill and it was over $20.00 and with tip it came to $25+ dollars???  (Expensive breakfast)That a very nice meal at almost any restaurant in town. And by the way a small glass of orange juice is over $4.00..."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast yesterday morning (4/15) and am thrilled to have found this little gem!  We walked in and were told to sit anywhere so we grabbed a booth in the corner.  Our server came over and introduced herself as Jessica (I think...?).  She was soooo friendly!!  

We let her know that it was our first time in, and she welcomed us, thanked us for coming in and immediately began recommending things for us to try.  People usually enjoy their sausage biscuit gravy and their corned beef hash.  I got both and she was right.... Both were great!!!  I've included some pics of my food - eggs over medium, corned beef hash, hashbrowns and a biscuit and gravy.  It was outstanding!   All three of us really enjoyed our orders.  Adding to the great food, was the great service.  Jessica was attentive and very good about making sure we had what we needed.  

Verdict:  This experience was as good as it gets!  Highly recommend this place - I'll be looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Loved it ! Quick bite , tasty food and friendly service ! Amazing Cali Benedict!
Coffee was great as well and the chorizo omelette my husband really liked!
Definitely recommend trying !"}
{"text":"In AZ for couple of days and my friend took me to the Breakfast Nook. And I am glad she did!

My breakfast was incredible! I had homemade corn beef hash. You knew from the first bite that it did not come out of a can. They took their time with this. So good! The best I have ever had. Bacon, hash browns and toast, all was excellent and I washed it down with cranberry juice. 

A little pricey, but you have to \"pay to play\" (Nirvana)"}
{"text":"The BREAKFAST NOOK is AWESOME!!! If u like a little spicy..try the Fiesta Skillet with fresh sqeezed OJ....Loved it.. TRY IT!!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed exceptional and attentive customer service and incredible food!!  Highly recommend the eggs Benedict and the made-from-scratch corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop! We were newer to the area and wanted to find something close and with classic breakfast items, and wasn't overpriced.  Food is great, service is super courteous and quick. If you're feeling like a good breakfast without all of the new trendy fanfare, and want some good eggs, sausage, pancakes, waffles, and hash browns give this place a try."}
{"text":"GREAT family owned business  The food is always delicious here and the service is great. There can be a bit of a wait at times, but let me assure you that it is worth it! Anyone comparing this place to McDonalds or complaining about prices needs a reality check. Come hungry, be patient and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Good eats! We would not have found the place without Yelp help. I hade the western Benedict. A great, artery-clogging combo of traditional Benedict. So good. My wife had the ridiculously great looking stuffed French toast with cheese and strawberries. She looks bed it. When I went for a taste? Poof. Gone. 

With doctor permission, we will return soon."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, close to home. I hope they do well. I really enjoy their hashbrowns. The Alaskan Waffle is out of this world. I've got so many things I want to try. Good to have some close neighborhood eats."}
{"text":"First and foremost, WHAT A GREAT addition to the Cave Creek community!  We've eaten here a number of times now and had a chance to try multiple different dishes here and honestly, this is one of our new local favorites HANDS DOWN.
Delicious food, fun menu, and FAMILY OWNED!!  In today's world of corporate conglomerates, it's just darn refreshing to see a family roll up their sleeves and work hard for the community.
Now I will admit, after reading 2 specific reviews here, I personally have a bone to pick!  Anyone who goes to a breakfast restaurant on a Sunday morning: BE NICE!, and BE PREPARED TO WAIT LIKE THE REST OF US!  When you're posting about auto shops and every other review is negative, stick to what you know, WHICH IS NOT RESTAURANTS!!!, so go to Dennys if you can't say anything nice.
Also, when you eat at a breakfast restaurant on a Sunday right when they're closing after a jammed packed week, ya know they might be out of an item or two..... It happens!!!
But don't bash a lovely family because you're already an unhappy person who knows JACK about food or restaurants.  
NOOK is great!!  These folks have the hearts of gold and make you feel like you're family, serving up wonderful dishes PERIOD!
Love this place, will support them until my hollandaise induced heart attack comes along!
Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Always nice to have a good breakfast in the hood. Pretty basic here. Feels a bit small town in there which isn't really a bad thing. Kinda like that. Generally I'll judge a breakfast house on their bacon. Nobody has the same idea of what eggs done medium is, so I can forgive that. And the bacon was really good. Big pieces. Love that. Do think its pricey for what it is. Virtually nothing under $10. The basic eggs, bacon and toast starts at 10. Kind of the way things are these days. 

But heres the deal. I can still get a hashbrown, sausage and coffee a block down the street for $3.85 at a place called McDonald's. Might not be as fresh but it ain't bad. Makes it hated to compete. Hope the Nook can hang in there."}
{"text":"Originally when this place first opened I gave it 5 stars. It was a nice addition to The Tatum Ranch community. It was nice, clean, the food was good and people were friendly. 

Unfortunately,I had to change my rating to one star and that is only because the pancakes were yummy. Everything else went down hill. My friend and I went in yesterday after a bike ride and the place was filthy. There was food on the floor under tables and booths, sections of the floor were dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. The women's bathroom was gross and again looked like it hadn't been cleaned, and this wasn't just dirt from the morning. The table next to us had pieces of melon and food under the table,but when it was cleaned off and re set, no one bothered to sweep up the food. There was another table that got up and had scramble eggs on the floor  underneath were the kids were sitting. They cleaned the table, set it and sat another group there without ever touching the floor. It was so bad the waitress was walking through the eggs. 

I had said something to the manager, who just gave me a dumb stare,said ok, and never made a move to do anything. It wasn't until we were leaving that a bus boy finally came out with a dust pan and broom. It is going to take alot more that a dust pan and broom to clean it up. If they want to make it in a place were restaurants are on every corner, they better clean up their act. People will start to notice how dirty is is and not come back, like us. We won't be back until we know it has been cleaned up."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time two weeks after they opened, and have returned a dozen times since. The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. I always have the breakfast burrito and it has always been delicious. I even get it to go sometimes when I'm out running around, and it's always piping hot when I get home. My mom had the veggie omelet and it was very good, and huge! My husband, who is usually very picky tried their corn beef hash and was very impressed. They are very eager to get you exactly what you want, how you want it. We are very glad they opened up right around the corner."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out for a while so we stopped in on our way out of town. I have the cowgirl special with the french toast. I love french toast and their batter is great!!!! Plus they scrambled my eggs well (burnt) just like I like them. My partner got the chicken fried chicken and thought the gravy was pretty bland. Maybe it was an off day for the gravy not sure. He almost always orders something with gravy though so he likes most gravy. When we paid we did let the cashier know that the gravy seemed a little bland. He didn't even react. All he needed to say was \"I'm sorry to hear that I will pass on your feedback.\" If we had just had the french toast it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"We randomly stopped in and a e had both breakfast and lunch items and everything was great! Very simple and clean and good service. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"**EDIT**  Would not recommend, after receiving an incredibly vulgar email from an employee.  Have fun loading the reviews with friends of yours.  There are better places to get breakfast around Cave Creek. **Edit**

Really great to have a breakfast place in a small neighborhood, within walking distance of our home in La Tierra even! Now if only we could get traffic to slow down.

What we loved - pancakes were good, just not a lot of variation available. The turkey sausage was excellent, where do you find them?!? Plenty of space, and the staff were super friendly. 

What we didn't love: no hot chocolate   (please don't go with packaged stuffy when you do offer it!), the hash browns were undercooked and over greased, and the lighting was off - that blue lighting like a drug store or gas mart.

We may go back in next few weeks, hopefully there'll be some improvements by then"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after hearing about it on Next Door. It's a quaint little place with excellent lighting and a bright and airy feel. My kids ordered the Mickey Mouse pancakes (fluffy  and a great taste), my husband had the Reuban and fries and I had the BLT and side salad. My husband liked his sandwich and fries (crunchy without the grease). The side salad was okay. Will definitely come back and try out the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast and lunch. The Eggs Benedict was the best tasted with enough hollandaise sauce. Their fries have to be tried. The only reason for 4 stars was because they need some color in there to liven up the place...dull nothing. But the food is so good that I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. I understand they sometimes they make mistakes but what restaurant doesn't? The food is good and consistent and I love supporting small businesses. In my opinion of these people are too lazy to make their own breakfast, don't knock someone else for doing their job even if it's not \"your standards\""}
{"text":"Edit-my son and I stopped in for breakfast at 9 on Thursday 1/10/17, we were told to sit where we would like to. There were many issues (makes me sad, we really like this place normally). First, the server brought coffee (lipstick on mug, always a pet peeve) and forgot OJ until after food arrived. My son ordered chicken fried chicken and eggs over medium, I ordered the midwest benedict, eggs over medium. Our food arrived and we dug in. First, hash browns were super oily and limp, my eggs were covered by sausage gravy so I did not know they were damn near raw until I had a few bites and saw the slime. Tried to get our servers attention but she was too busy bussing tables and the host guy was too busy facebooking or texting to be bothered and he literally hid behind the high counter. Server finally came over and found the BOTH of us had almost raw eggs, (seriously, gross!) and she offered to have the breakfast re made. Now while we were waiting I saw the one of the kitchen workers come out of the kitchen and he was dirty and sweaty and no hairnet and I was so disgusted by the raw eggs that I no longer wanted to eat. Son finished his chicken that he said was good, and I sent my breakfast back sans four bites. The server never came back even to bring our check, so I had to go up to the counter and pay and the host guy (tall guy, young) rang me up for $18 and some change. They still charged us for my son's breakfast, two coffees, and one OJ. I should have told them to suck eggs (see what I did there) but I paid and even tipped our seriously bad server. I don't think we will be back. This was one bad experience I am not going to repeat. Cave Creek has way too many options to be treated that way and to be served bad food.  Bye Breakfast Nook, it was nice knowing you.


Went to try out this new gem on Cave Creek Road this morning. We arrived at 915 and were seated immediately. Our server brought fresh squeezed orange juice. Hubby had the Irish hash skillet and loved it. I had the Midwest Benedict, very tasty. Biscuits with a sausage patty and poached eggs with sausage gravy, side of perfect hash browns. Try it, our server Jessica was awesome."}
{"text":"I come here all the time great food and service every time . A great family owned business. My daughter Sammy best breakfast place ever."}
{"text":"The staff is very nice/friendly however this place is very old fashioned/grungy and frankly given the vast array of dining choices in this area, there is nothing super compelling to go back to here..food was OK, prices were OK to high considering the antiquated environment. I stopped in the ladies room on the way out and it was really pretty dirty/again grungy..this turned me off to the point where I have not gone back. I'm hoping the spend some money and invest in their business to make this clean, appealing and offer some value."}
{"text":"Had a nice homey breakfast at this tasty spot. 
Not fancy in any way but clean and good. 
Appreciate a neighborhood breakfast. 
Coffee is not Starbucks but it is good. 
Original Benedict was delicious and I enjoyed the panCAKES."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning around 10:30 and there was a 15 minute wait for two.  Our server was great and so was the young man who refilled waters and coffees a few times.

Ordered chicken fried chicken, eggs, hashbrowns and fruit which I split with my husband.  Everything was great.  Prices are good too!

Restrooms clean, lots of parking all around."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the meat lovers omelette and it was delicious. Staff were super friendly. Will be coming back soon. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. We wouldn't have found it if it weren't for Yelp. They don't even have a sign by the road like the other business in this shopping center. I actually would only give the food 3 stars, but since the service was so good I'll give them 4. My wife had a steak omelet that she described as \"okay\". I had the fried steak. It was good. The gravy & hash-browns required a LOT of salt & pepper as they were pretty bland. Nothing other than the pancake appeared to be from scratch. I assumed the gravy was made from a package, same with the hash browns. My wife said the flank steak used in the omelet was bland. The pancakes though were super fluffy. Our 16 month old son liked his pancake (although it wasn't shaped like Mickey like in some pics on yelp), scrambled eggs and ham. Our server was super friendly and attentive. We would give them another try. It's nice to finally ha e some local food in the area."}
{"text":"Great food very friendly staff.. love this place and really happy it opened so close to me!! Breakfast options are unreal!"}
{"text":"Food and service were good. No complaints. Its nice to finally have another breakfast option in the Cave Creek area. Family owned and operated. We are big supporters of local businesses and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place had the worst service. We were sitting there for more than 30 minutes without any water. Then finally we got our food that wasn't even that warm. After eating half of my food I found multiple hairs in it. One of which were in my mouth."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict did not disappoint with a side of the sausage gravy to dip the house fries in. Not to mention the appetizer of the Alaskan waffle per our waitress Jessica's suggestion. And top it off with fresh squeezed OJ. Great service, great food and great price. The breakfast nook is a definite go to. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good quiet place to go eat with family(never been there on the weekend).  The food is good. And the service is great."}
{"text":"A delicious breakfast at a Great price!  The owners are very welcoming and service is great. We will be back for sure!  Thanks Brittney!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this new restaurant. They serve lunch not just breakfast as the name suggested. Had the fish sandwich. It was fantastic, one of the best I have had, especially in this area. Love the slaw they use. Wife had the berry salad with chicken. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Highly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast place (probably good for lunch as well) you won't regret coming too.  We have been here many times and tried a lot of the dishes and nothing has disappointed us. 

This trip we got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast, Waffle, Biscuits n Gravy and scrambled eggs with bacon.  The French toast has been by far the best French toast I have ever had. Wow is not a big enough word to describe how great it was.   

You won't be disappointed to come here and meet the new locals from Chicago settling in our beautiful area."}
{"text":"Food is consistently really good, service is exceptional!! Staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are happy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Has become one of my favorites! Great fast and polite service. Food is fast and really tasty! Can't wait for this place to open one up in the east valley. Keep up the great work and see you on Saturday's!"}
{"text":"Cute new little breakfast place, friendly staff, fast service, & tasty food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in people look at you, because it's just one big open space (like a converted elementary school room) and there is not much else to look at, little decor on the grey colored walls. They just opened and probably the warmth will come.   Speaking of warmth, it was freezing cold in here. My nose started to run, no joke. 

The service was awesome. Not just ours but all the tables around us were well cared for. Nobody waited for coffee or water or to order. 

I had oatmeal and a side of home fries. The oatmeal was delicious, the home fries were greasy and did not have onion or peppers, just small cubes of greasy potato.  I don't mind a little fat, olive oil and even butter go very nicely with potato. But this grease tasted cheap. I wouldn't order them again.  My gf had the veggie skillet and she liked it very much."}
{"text":"Awesome food and super friendly staff!! They had a great menu and even offered daily specials with unique options like Oreo pancakes yum!!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for breakfast once as it was en route.. A pleasant surprise. The staff were very nice and  helpful, the service good and the food was excellent. Simple, straightforward breakfast fare, very nicely done. Certainly planning to visit more when I get the chance."}
{"text":"First time today, finally a breakfast place nearby. Service and food were great! If you live near this place, I'd check it out."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! Horriable service and they have no idea what they are doing. We ended up walking out to a cold breakfast and 45 min wait. Plus saw our waitress once in 45 min. Aweful, will not be back."}
{"text":"I had the Irish skillet and it was delicious! Fresh squeezed OJ and to finish it all off had he Alaskan Waffle.. WOWWW! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love a diner atmosphere.  Coffee is great, people are super friendly.  Husband enjoyed the biscuits and gravy.  Omelette was tasty, just need a little more browning on the hash-browns but that's my preference.  Fair prices and it was hopping.  Love a local business!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood breakfast/brunch place.  Stopped in on a Saturday and immediately was drawn back to my childhood. this place smells like a diner should in the best possible way!  Coffee, syrup, bacon, all wrapped up together.  Heaven!  Ordered the special chicken Florentine omlette and the cowgirl breakfast.  Both excellent, we couldn't stop.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Place was very clean and bright if a bit Stark on decor.  Will definitely go back, want to try the lunch Options"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. They were out of everything, so our food choices were limited. Service was okay, but if you're looking for a great breakfast place, don't go here."}
