{"text":"El Molino makes the chimichanga by which I rate all other chimichangas -- if another restaurant doesn't give it  just the right crispiness, with just the right accompaniments of cheese, guacamole and sour cream, then it just doesn't cut it. By the way, after almost 30 years in Phoenix I've eaten more chimichangas than I care to admit. Get El Molino's chicken or machaca chimi, which is often a nightly special for under $8, and you will be in sinus-clearing chimi heaven."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food period. I've been eating here multiple times a week for 15 years. Never bad food never a problem. Never even had them mess up an order. They always have it right. Carne Asada tacos with guacamole and tamales or chicken chimi enchilada style with green sauce are my favorites. -Kevin"}
{"text":"This is the way Mexican food tastes in Mexico!  I had an awesome carne asana burro for lunch today."}
{"text":"Delicious, Fresh, Authentic, Succulent, Wonderful, Delectable, and just outright GREAT!  Plus the staff is friendly and attentive.  My adult son and I eat here at least twice a week and sometime more.  The Burros are mouthwatering and the Chimichangas are big and juicy! Fresh Salsa & Guacamole are MUSTS! Awesome food, Awesome staff, Awesome service! The triple-A rating! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I eat at El Molino an average of once a week for lunch, if that tells you anything.  I like it!  The food is consistently good, the prices are fair, and people who run the place are very nice (Gloria, Lupe, and Richard).  They very thoughtfully have a selection of daily news papers (Wall Street Journal, AZ Republic, etc...) for you to read while waiting for food or while eating.  And, they have free refills on soft drinks.  Warning, if you are super sensitive to spicy food, be very careful when ordering.  Their food can get hot (try the chips and salsa).  And, boy is it good.  I usually split a delicious chicken chimichanga with my wife.  We try to avoid fried food, but their chimis rock!  We occasionally get enchiladas, which are also very tasty.  Probably the only thing I've tried and won't order again (although one of friends does) is their hard shell taco.  It's too oily or greesey for my taste.  But hey, you might like it.  Overall, I highly recommend El Molino.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has been a family staple of ours since it was in Phoenix. I think my older sister only comes home at Christmas for the fridge stocked with green chile mixed burros. Make sure you try their guacamole & salsa they are by far the best around and can make your Taco Tuesday at home really special. The service is always top notch and we are welcomed like long lost family."}
{"text":"Our family has been eating at El Molino's for over twenty years, through all locations starting at the old Dairy Queen on Scottsdale Road.  I can't think of tastier, more delicious food from any Mexican restaurant in the Valley.  And although the atmosphere is quaint, the quality and attention to detail make you forget you are eating at a largely \"take out style\" restaurant.  Experience the difference, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to El Molino at various locations for about fifteen years.  I miss Martha, Paula's daughter, as she was very entertaining and a lot of fun to chat with.  The food, it's just incredible.  Always freshly prepared, always beautifully packaged for take-out.  Lupe, who has been running the kitchen for many years is always smiling, and accepts my custom orders with a chuckle and \"thank you.\"  I can highly recommend their guacamole which is seasoned perfectly and never overwhelming.  Please try the carne asada tacos, my personal favorite.  Please tell Martha to come back so we can reconnect!  Martha, if you come back, it's five stars sister!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to work near El Molino and have enjoyed many many lunches here. The food and atmosphere are not fancy at all but the dishes are sure to please. It's very affordable Mexican with big flavor!  I'll drive out of my way to have me some El Molino.  Be sure to try the homemade Lemonade too! For under $10 you get some of the best Mexican food around. Give it try!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a Mexican-food snob, but this was basically overpriced-Del Taco fare. The food was nothing to write home about. It was served on Styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking."}
{"text":"Placed my very 1st order today. I am very pleased with my order. Very friendly and the BEST customer service I've dealt with since moving to the valley. Thank you for being awesome!  I order a Green Chili with Shredded beef burrito, cheese quesadilla, side of beans, chips and salsa, and a side of sour cream. It was worth the wait and can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Palo Alto and found this great little Mexican Cafe....had a superb chimichanga (machac)...the guacamole is the best ever!!!!  I am having them ship me 2 dozen  green tamales for Thanksgiving ...my new favorite mexican food  in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't incredible but it was decent. I had a mishap with an online order so the manager offered to pay for my meal and deliver it to me the next night - great customer service! We ordered a chicken burrito, machaca enchiladas, beans and rice. The chicken was juicy but made the burrito watery. The enchiladas were decent but the beans and rice were great. I'd definitely be willing to try a few more items on the menu but the customer service is what really won me over."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my work, its fast, and the food is good, I am a big fan of the Green Chili Burrito. They always seem to have a pretty decent lunch special that includes rice/beans and a drink for under 9 bucks. The service can be spotty, but its clean, cheap and the food is good."}
{"text":"Best chimichangas in PHX. But don't have any ideas about the atmospere. Take the food to go!"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. Quick delivery that will actually deliver from Scottsdale to Tempe. I loved my carne asada burrito. Will definitely keep them as my go-to for great Mexican delivery."}
{"text":"5 stars across the board! Every visit has been a positive experience...always friendly service...fresh authentic mexican food prepared by long time employees...they offer options when placing an order and each dish is served made to order...best tamales in town, among other yummy menu items! Cute traditional decor and casual atmosphere make this spot a local favorite for lunch or dinner. If you crave real deal Mexican...you will crave El Molino!"}
{"text":"My co-worker called in an order at 1:30 pm, well after lunch rush and was told by the lady that answered the phone that \"she needed to order right now or forget it\".  Ummmm, seriously?? She's lucky it wasn't me that called it in.  She would have gotten a piece of my mind and NOT received the order.  Luckily for them, she is a lot nicer than me.    1 Star is for my co-workers Carne Asada Burrito, she says it is \"the bomb\". 1/2 Star is for my rice that is fairly tasty. 1/2 Star is for the delivery being fairly quick.  I got just a ground beef/bean burrito with lettuce/sour cream/cheese.  Pretty much tasted like Taco Bell's Burrito Supreme.  Nothing to write home about...at all.  Overall completely irritated I wasted good money on this place.   Get SOMEONE ELSE to answer your phone if you want repeat business!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos and bigger for same price as American Taco. Good delivery too but if its true everything is microwaved I might go with American Taco shop even though they're half the size and soft not crunchy"}
{"text":"I love El Molino!! My favorite Mexican food place hands down! Family owned. I used to go there all the time when I worked in Old Town and I had not been there in probably 7 to 10 years and they still remembered me."}
{"text":"SCOTTSDALE'S BEST KEPT SECRET!!!!  I had dinner here 2night on the way home from walking my dogs and, never having eaten here before, wasn't expecting anything much.  I was just hungry and needed to eat.  But OMG, I thought I had died and gone to heaven!  I've eaten at every Mexican restaurant and cafe in town and this little place was the absolute best, BAR NONE!!!  I am a vegan and can't eat wheat or any kind of gluten which never leaves me much choice and always leaves me hungry afterwards.  So I ordered two tacos with potatoes, beans, tomatoes, lettuce and guacamole.  The soft corn tortillas were really BIG and super tasty compared to those wimpy, tasteless little ones you get everywhere else that are too small to hold anything more than what would be considered an appetizer.  They are doubled too...meaning 2 tortillas per taco so they don't break apart.   And they were literally packed with all the goodies!  And those potatoes!  Now let me tell you, there are potatoes and there are potatoes and then there are El Molino's potatoes!  They seem to be sautéed and are in large chunks not wussy little minced things.  I might also add that their salsa is pretty darn good too..nice and spicy.  Oh, and the service was wonderful.  Martha, the daughter of one of the owner's is an absolute sweetheart and between her and her Mom in the kitchen, they can tweak anything on the menu to suit your needs.  In fact, I've been told if you call in a day or 2 early requesting something special, they  might be able to round it up for you.  Oh, and don't forget to ask if they happen to have any homemade chicken soup back there in the kitchen!  It's not on the menu but sometimes they make it for themselves and will happily share.    Well, all I can say now to sum up this little gem of a place is to tell you that I walked out of there tonight with a full tummy, completely satisfied and with a big smile on my face.  Considering that most of the items on the menu I can't even eat due to my dietary restrictions, can you imagine how good it must be for those of you who can partake of the entire menu?  Be still my heart!!!  Oh, and one other thing:  what's up with those reviewers who said the staff was rude and unfriendly?  If that was true this family's restaurant would never have survived the 80 years they have been in business....and 80 years is a heck of a testimony to their  delicious, authentic food too!"}
{"text":"They improvements to the restaurant are great... they place is warm and inviting and the big screen TVs and free Wifi make it a great place to eat there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The bean and cheese burritos are super fresh and their sauce is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here at this place for years, as they moved around to a few different locations, primarily for one reason: their salsa! It is homemade, and too hot for some people's taste but I love it. We always get great service from the staff but maybe that's because we're regulars. In any case, I'm there for lunch almost every week!"}
{"text":"This is always a favorite place to order from when we have Mexican food brought in, they do an outstanding job, and have the best tamale in town"}
{"text":"Great customer service, fantastic food, and they deliver! You wouldn't believe the amount of chicken they put in their green chili burrito, and chicken salad. Their hot sauce is just like my families, spicy and flavorful, yum!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I fell for the Groupon Now deal, again, but I did.  NEVER will I go back to this place.   I had been before and it was decent so I thought I'd go back for a breakfast burrito. I'm with the earlier comment, I have never paid to be treated like such garbage.  I truly hopes this business fails because that guy Ricky or whatever was awful.  My order was wrong and it was WAY too expensive."}
{"text":"My first time and last. I ordered takeout the rice was hard and no favor and the refried beans tasted like it was from the can. My whole meal had no taste to it. My lunch was no good."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars for their food and fast service ONLY! So far I've had their green corn tamale (so so), their chicken quesadilla (my favorite but super greasy), and their chicken tacos (completely bland and super greasy as well). The service there is fast which I really like as I usually get food on my lunch break. However, the guy behind the counter with the glasses is out of it. He always forgets to give me my drink unless I ask for it, even then he has to check the ticket to make sure I paid. Not only that but it's rather small inside so when it gets busy at lunch it can be hard to get to the soda fountain to even fill up your cup. I was just there today and none of the customers would move so I literally had to push past their seats and almost hit a customer with my purse because they were in the way. It's not the customers fault at all, I just know if it were me in their seat I would be upset that they didn't think that through better. The guy behind the counter is always chatting with customers so he seems like a pretty decent guy and I'll continue to eat there occasionally for lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch from them through a service They offer through GrubHub and Eat24 for delivery. Asked for it to be delivered at 11:40. By 12 , it still was not here. When I called, they told me they were having troubles reviewing orders through those services and hadn't relieved my order. The lady I spoke to pulled up their email and saw my order, then proceeded to tell me they could make my order then and get it me. My lunch time was already over and I wanted a refund. I explained that if they knew they were having troubles receiving orders, they should be checking the email to ensure those customers don't get forgotten. She then told me to get a refund I have to call the company I ordered through and that there was nothing she could do. She then passed my on to the manager who was just at rude about the situation and did nothing to try to keep my service. Needless to say, my staff and I did not have lunch today and will never be eating here again. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED!!!! If you don't want to help customers and keep your clients, this is how to do it."}
{"text":"The only thing I liked were the apple empanadas... The food was a little bland the night I went, but the people seem sweet and the dessert is on point."}
{"text":"It's the best Mexican delivery in Scottsdale if you have enough of their hot sauce BUT apparently their hot sauce is so precious you can't get more with deliveries no matter how clear you make it. I order at least once a week and EVERY SINGLE TIME I tell them I need extra hot sauce. They so ok and I say, \" PLEASE I need extra hot sauce. You guys always forget so please put 2 in, I will pay for it if I need to\". The nice lady on the phone says \"okay, okay we have it\". I'll say, \"are you sure, I need extra. Not one but 2.\" She says \"yes, yes we have that\". Guess what happens AT LEAST half of the time.....no extra hot sauce. I mean when I get my order I look around for Ashton Kutcher to see if I am being punked, tonight after asking for extra and clarifying at least 3 times not only was my ONE hot sauce container half full but so was the guac and sour cream. El Molina, I hope you read this.....PLEASE listen to people when they call and place an order. You never have a problem getting the credit card # right but for some reason you hate giving extra hot sauce. I mean, charge more if you need to, tell people you only make a certain amount each day or just tell people I don't give a crap about you and you aren't getting hot sauce....do whatever but just don't always say \"ok, ok, yes, yes sure hot sauce\" and then not give and extra. COME ON ALREADY, it gets so old!"}
{"text":"El Molino consistently has some of the best \"fast\" Mexican food in Scottsdale. I really find it a go to place for their chicken burrito, it is truly fabulous. White meat chicken, juicy and wet with a green (?) spicy sauce-it is hot and delicious. I have never found a better chicken burrito. Awesome! Sometimes I think their prices are high, but when in for lunch and the \"make it a combo\" deal is used (you gotta look for it), it makes it a very reasonable venture."}
{"text":"It smells so good in here!! I couldn't wait to eat!! Thanks for the great atomosohere for my gaming team. We had a BLAST!!! Food was so excellent! I brought home a shredded beef crunchy taco for the wife, and she approves!!!  Great job @pelone (DG) - Smart move teaming up with this place!!"}
{"text":"The green corn tamales are hands down the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Mind Blowing!  But that is the one and only good thing I can say about this place. The rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are HORRIBLE.   My co-workers and I ordered $70 worth of food from El Molino and noticed one Item was missing. Upon calling the restaurant, I got argued with, yelled at, and accused of stealing by the delivery driver who stated he was also the owner. Who steals a taco salad?!   El Molino - You have lost a loyal client. I will miss the tamales."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great delivery! We got the the Pepe Sample Platted and got two mini chimis instead. Great pricing considering they deliver."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner about 20 minutes from closing on a Saturday night, yet they were still willing to deliver to our resort.  The food arrived within the quoted time, and was nice and hot.  The food was absolutely wonderful.  The individually wrapped tacos were super authentic, the enchiladas were flavorful and the nachos were loaded with cheese and chicken.  The salsa is nice and spicy, and the portions were plentiful.  If you are in the area, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"El molino delivers via grubhub/eat24.. they are prompt and delicious!!!! The tacos are a little greasy but I'm not complaining--i'm the one ordering delivery mexican!! Perfect hang over food, huge variety, super authentic.   The machaca melts in your mouth , no stringy fat, and their quesasillas are huge! I suggest ordering the meat on the side in a quesadilla.  It's too juicy; it soaks the tortilla!   You wont be disappointed by el molino!!"}
{"text":"Very rude, not deserving of our business. I called and asked for delivery and the response I got was \"you're really rackin them up here!\"  I didn't know what he was talking about and he explained he just got 2 previous delivery requests so \"hey.. it may be a while\".  I thought he was kidding but he was actually annoyed that I wanted delivery. So I hung up.  Places like this DO NOT DESERVE our business."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get homemade Mexican food in Scottsdale!!! The machaca was insane!! It melts in your mouth and has just the right amount of spice. The owners were so sweet and nice!!! Don't listen to these people who gave bad reviews.  I swear you'll go and love it!!!  They probably think taco bell is good mexican :P"}
{"text":"The place is terribly pricey for a mostly take-out style joint, but on my first visit I went simple and tried the chicken burro which i had been assured was all white meat (very rare). The $7.50 burro was simple as it contained nothing but stewed chicken in a sort of mildly spicy green chile sauce, but it wasn't wet and sloppy. The chicken was tasty and loaded down with plenty of meat, so it is probably worthy of another visit for that item. The next level burrito with more stuff inside and a side of rice would have been close to ten bucks and most other items that would fill you up were at that price point and above. For the sake of the solid white meat though, it is worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! Service was fast and the food was delicious, very reasonable prices too, highly recommend this place for a quick meal, they deliver too"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats. Arrived with 2/3 items ordered. Cheese enchiladas were small and not very good. Re fried beans were good though."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. It wasn't super flavorful and I felt it was a bit too greasy. I think there are def. better options. I also saw this microwave as previously mentioned..?!?"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken taco, but I've had much better. Go to Chipotle or Qdoba or Blue Burrito instead ... the customer service and food is SO much better.  Yes I know they're not real \"Mexican\" food but neither is this place. Lol.  Also, the owner was really, really rude and unfriendly. I haven't had service this bad in awhile.  This place is just ... ick.  Edited to add: If you're interested in legit Mexican food, go to America's Taco Shop on 1st Street. It's SO good and the service is excellent. Much better than  this place."}
{"text":"Very good food, I was staying @ The Andaz and I ordered the food to my room. Quality was very good and flavor was too. I will be ordering again tru my stay here."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from GrubHub and really regret it.  The food showed up without the drink I ordered, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but these guys chare $9 for delivery!!!! PLUS, he got his 15% tip!  For that kind of cash he should have gone to the corner store to get it.  His 'I'm sorry' cost me alot of $$$$.  And, to top it off, threw out the food.  They put an enchilada into styro without a foil lining, so the enchilada melted the container, rendering the food inedible.  Awful customer service."}
{"text":"On Yelpers recommendations I tried it.  Not great, not terrible.  My carne asada buritto was a bit dry and lacked a distinctive taste.  A good value given the reasonalble prices and fast service makes it a solid choice for lunch.  In reading more reviews I'll be back to try the chimi."}
{"text":"Boo.... I was super excited to try this place because it is near my house and it got good reviews, but was unfortunately disappointed.   First off, they need to update their website, they do not have delivery. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and my boyfriend ordered a red chili burrito and chicken taco.   We both had the red sauce and it was burnt... so bad that I had to scrape it off to even have a few bites, then I gave up.  His burrito tasted burnt too, which meant it was the sauce not the entrée itself.   Their beans were pretty dry and nothing to get excited about.   BF did like the chicken taco, he said the shell was crispy but not greasy. Their chips and salsa were good, spicy but good.    Overall, I had a bad experience because the only thing I ordered was burnt, I think I would try it one more time, but next time in the restaurant, that way if it is bad, I can get my money back!"}
{"text":"Have I ever shared my issues with microwaves before? I know I am a creep but I really dislike microwaved food. I almost had a meltdown when my expensive green chile burro was placed in the microwave.   It was $11 and it's not even fresh? Is it cold? I watched you scoop it onto the tortilla, it wasn't from the fridge and if it wasn't hot to serve......does that mean it was at the perfect temperature for food born bacteria?    Also, don't you know microwaves make tortillas all funky and weird textured?   While it was microwaving I was able to check out the dried, crusty filth on all of the appliances: evidence of cooking and not cleaning. Yuck.  I really need to stop looking at stuff like that.   Luckily, I was able to talk myself out of being a total nut job and I ate it. I was only able to eat  some of it because 1. it was effing huge and 2. the image of the crusty splatter kept popping into my head. regardless, It was so tasty.   My favorite green chile burro used  to be from Espos but I have other issues with Espos.  This burro compares and while not totally clean and it being overpriced... and the fact that they microwaved it....it was really really really good.  like good enough for me to give this place 3 stars.   I like my green chile burros made with shredded beef, none of that weird cubed meat for me,  and they deliver on that aspect!  i honestly don't know if i'm capable of going again, but if you're more hardcore than i am and you are down with the get down, the i say munch up!"}
{"text":"Ok. So the food is decent, if you actually get what you order. My workplace orders here often because they deliver. But rarely do we get what we order. Today only 2 orders out of 3 came... they had to come back for the 3rd person's order. And the 2 that we did get were incorrect. \"No tomatoes\" shouldn't be a hard thing for a taco. The taco salad is good sometimes. Sometimes not. Machaca beef is good but sometimes mouth-on-fire hot. If you are dining in maybe it's better and you can have them fix things on the spot. But if you get delivery, you're probably SOL. So whatever. We will probably keep ordering from here, cause sometimes it's good, they deliver, Mexican food sounds good, and most of the time we are too busy to leave work to eat. Just sucks when it's not good and you don't get what you order."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh ingredients! Friendly fast service. Eat in, take out or delivery! Ive eaten here several times and will be back"}
{"text":"I literally live 1/4 of a mile from this eatery.  I would never have tried it except for reading a Yelp review that called out what I will echo: you would never guess something this authentically good exists in a nondescript setback shopping strip.  I was starving and needed cheap eats.  I showed up at 5p on a Saturday.  I was welcomed by the \"OPEN - ABIERTO\" sign, made me start feeling the authentic ethic vibe.  When I entered I immediately noticed the strong cleaning smell.  A smell that I have smelled other times in mexican joints actually in Mexico so I took that as a good authentic smell vs. a bad one.  Not sure if you can order Mexican \"TVs\" but they have two of them with poor reception playing futbol; making this place authentic.  Add a large floor fan going, plus a tall gray waste basket near the serving counter, plus a host of beers and wine, plus them trying to make it look like the typical half-ass built mexican cantinas by spray painting faux cracks in the wall, plus the friendly spanish speaking food staff, plus the que bueno carne asada burro with caliente salsa, and El Molino Mexican Cafe sums to a very decent place to grab some inexpensive Mexican food.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars just yet - - - would have been nice to see some other sit-down patrons to make it a fiesta and I had to wait a little too long for my burro.  But heck, that's authentic mexican!"}
{"text":"So I made it here yesterday for lunch and it was as good as I remember.  I am not sure why I haven't been here in sooo many years.  I used to come here all the time.  Anyway I am glad I made it back and will ensure it makes it into my work week lunch rotation:).  I decided on the cheese crisp an a shredded beef taco both were perfect and hit the spot.  My lunch companions had: shredded beef chimi special + rice + beans the other had a carne asada beef burrito.  Both entrees looked really tasty and they both were happy with their choices.  I will surely be back next week to try something new;)"}
{"text":"Dropped off cleaning the other day & found El Molino by accident down several spaces.  It was so good I posted it on Facebook!  Very simple place, but clean with immediate attention & great prices!  I had an imported Pacifico beer & order of 3 beef rolled tacos with guacamole, lettuce & tomatoes for less than $10!  I LOVE Mexican food & I shall be back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I was in there getting take out one day and saw a cockroach cruising through the dining area.  Not exactly what you want to see as you are waiting for your dinner.  That would be my only complaint, but you know what they say about cockroaches, where you see one...."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and you have to know what to get. The Machaca beef is amazing and the enchiladas are on point. The owners might be old and fussy they have never bothered me but get what I tell you to get and you'll go home satisfied. It's a small joint so don't expect some great service only 2 people work here. This is a top 5 Mexican food spot!"}
{"text":"I woekd for el molinos for 17 plus years this place makes FRESH HOMEMADE MEXICAN FOOD !! so all you jokers who eat tex mex mexican food have no clue what good mexican food is i love el molinos and momma and of course lupe all my family and your loss if you dont go back !! BEST MACHACA EVER AND GREEN CORN TAMALES!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in PHX on business and searched for Mexican restaurants near my hotel. El Molino popped up and we decided to give it a try. Don't let the demure appearance scare you off. The restaurant is tucked into a strip center space, and we initially were put off. But we ordered from a large menu with multiple choices and waited with our beers. In a few minutes, our food was ready and was it good! The burrito with shredded beef and green chile sauce was fantastic, as were the sides. I will return!"}
{"text":"all in all not too bad...  for being in the heart of old town i think the prices are pretty good and the place is really clean... there is limited seating, but it looks more like a carry out place... to me this place is a nice version of a place you would find on the south side...   I loved the shredded beef tacos and they have hot salsa... and they serve beer at a good price..."}
{"text":"I love El Molinos!! Their breakfast burritos are my favorite! My definitely my go to place for mexican food and THEY DELIVER! Thats right Mexican food that delivers. The food is pretty authentic, which is rare to find in these neck of the woods.   I wish I could of taken a pic of how the food is packaged for delivery. I mean everything is sealed, taped and packaged very nicely and professionally! No messes, no forgotten items, LEGIT PACKAGING! Which to me is a big deal means they really care how your food is delivered!   Again highly recommend this place for eat in or delivery! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"I think I may be cheap but I don't understand why a cheese quesadilla is $4 and a chicken quesadilla is $9?    Someone please tell me what I'm missing."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this place.  Not only am i 2 hours still waiting for my delivery.  when i called i got pretty much yelled at for asking the eta for my food. i mean its two hours. i hope my food doesnt come cold. The male that i talked to didnt even look up my name, instead bluntly yelled out \"yea\" many of times then hung up. I called like 5 more times and no one answered.   Now to talk about when the delivery actually showed.  The driver was very sketching. I was paying cash and he didnt even know my total.  He was standing there saying \"ahh umm hmm. 17 18.. eh how about you just give me 20 bucks.\"  I was givin no receipt.  I been in the food industry for a long time now to know that he probably pocketed the money.  I was also missing the chips and salsa that i ordered.  The food is like miniatures. 1 Little rolled taco the size of my finger. 1 tostada the size of my palm.  The most itty bitty taco i have ever seen and the chicken meat in the middle was so over cooked it was like plastic. The pepes platter was like 9 bucks for all that waste.  No offense but the food was so bad, i didnt even bother calling to complain. because trust me i do not want to eat there food ever again. My whole entire experience here was the worst ive ever had.  LOL  Your whole resturant should just close down.  Its so pathedic. I got pictures. can i post pictures on here? At least you hit my number one place NEVER to go to again.  Is there a 0 star button? #ElMolinoMexicanCafe You make scottsdale look bad..."}
{"text":"I just ordered from here on grub-hub, despite all of the reviews posted. I am a firm believer of seeing things for my own eyes, in this case tasting it for myself. I ordered the Chicken Crisp which was horrible, It was soggy and absolutely inedible by the time it was delivered. I also ordered the plain cheese crisp. It was a pinch of cheese in between two 4' corn tortillas. I'm not going to even write about everything else I ordered, as you can tell where this is going. But I had to give them a 1 star because the best part out of this experience was the delivery driver, not only was he punctual he was also very polite and friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based on my experience but feel free to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Clean establishment. Rows of freezers in the back. Hidden from the street. Greeted by name what must be one of the regulars. Carries both Modelo and Dos Equis. Slowly made food for being dead. The green enchilada sauce is a must. Green chile chimis are fantastic.  For the price, it was certainly filling and enjoyable. A place to come back to if you're craving decent Mexican in a sit-down environment but are too far away from a Blue Burrito Grille."}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional and disappointing. I called to order 4 dozen rolled tacos the morning of Cinco De Mayo for an office event. I knew that El Molino would probably be busy that day, so I called and ordered 4 HOURS in advance to make sure it wouldn't be an issue. I spoke to the owner who told me it was no problem and he would have it taken care of. When I arrived to pick up my order, the staff had no orders for me. They all just shook their heads and no one even offered an apology. The owner couldn't even look me in the eye. Apparently they were understaffed, as if that was an acceptable excuse. Youre a MEXICAN FOOD restaurant on Cinco De Mayo! The least they could have done was called me to let me know so I could make alternative arrangements. Absolutely terrible. Then to top it off, when I was standing there at the counter waiting for some sort of resolution , the guy taking the orders picked up the phone right in front of me to take someone else's order- that's when I walked out.   Will NEVER use them again. Don't waste your time if you need a dependable catering option."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today during the lunch hour, and holy moly was it good! A friend recommended it, so we all went (as a rather large group) to try it out.   It's not a very fancy place, but boy does it deliver some great food! And the price is unbeatable; just about everything is under $10. I had \"Pepe's Sample Platter\" for ~$8 so I could try a little bit of everything. Others got burros, enchiladas and I think someone even got a tamale. Not one of us was disappointed.   The service is also extremely fast and very friendly. If you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat south of Old Town, skip the fast food burgers and stop by El Molino."}
{"text":"I think the lady behind the counter didn't like me.  Could've just been me.  I don't know.  It's just how I felt.  When my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said \"Al Molina\" and I was like, \"You mean the guy who played Doc Ock in Spider-Man II?\"  I've been here a few times, today was the first time I'd been to El Molino in about 8 months.  I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.  One thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.  It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.  The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.  I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.  Three stars:  Good.  Not great.  Weird bathroom.  Unfriendly lady.  Good food.  Too expensive."}
{"text":"Skip This restaurant if you want quality, fresh, hot, tasteful Mexican food. It's close so I've tried it a couple of times but the food lacks any flavor, the enchilada sauce is bland, and the rice is highly over cooked and completely tastless. Additionally they are overpriced. I've lived in the valley for 30 years and this ranks second from the bottom , worst being 'Old Town Gringos' on craftsman court .... Used to be dos gringos but they closed.  Try Frank & Lupes or TeePee for authentic fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"Good spot that gets the added nod due to its long standing reputation in the Valley.  The Machaca is worth the trip but the rest of the menu is pretty standard traditional Mexican fare.  The nice granite counters and copies of the Wall Street Journal belie its Mexican heritage. Consider it a Beto's for the Scottsdale crowd...or a more casual TeePee."}
{"text":"This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.  The management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well."}
{"text":"Well I promised my husband we would eat out less.  We, meaning him and I.  By myself, there is no we, just I, and I made no such promise.  I had to go to Staples, (never go to Staples hungry), and there was El Molino.  Calling to me like a beacon in the night.  Except it was day, and I wasn't navigating the sea.  And I figured, it has to be healthier than Betos.  I'm rethinking that call.  I had the special of two machaca tacos with rice and beans ($8).  The machaca was good, very spicy.  But the tacos shot a stream of grease every time I took a bite.  Beans and rice were alright, nothing special.  All in all, still just okay, but I wasn't scared of the beef like I sometimes am at Betos."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical based upon some other reviews... GLAD I ordered anyway! My experience: friendly customer service; accommodating with a special request on my order; delivery arrived in about 20 minutes with a smile (0.5 mile away to be fair); and the food was DELICIOUS and fresh to boot!! Would order from again and again! Thank you for an exceptional experience!"}
{"text":"What is up with yummy places closing at 8pm?! Chicago Burger Co and now El Molino! Instant star loss for early closures!  Though that'll be the only star loss.. the food here is fresh, home made and tasty! They make the best green chile in Old Town!   Cheap, tasty and friendly always has a place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Had the machaca with the green chile sauce and thought the flavor was amazing. Refried beans and rice were also excellent. Nice flavor and spice. Came with a drink for $9.50. Burro was huge. The only dings were  so so chips and as another reviewer said, the assembled product is microwaved to finish on a styrofoam plate. Can't complain about the flavor though and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"What?! Outta red beef tamales? Bogus.  My first experience at El Molino was really not that bad. Wanted a late afternoon lunch/dinner so I made my way over. Tip: the nachos are huge and one order was enough to share between myself and my girl. We ordered them with ground beef, which was tasty with a bit of a kick. They were also loaded down pretty well with cheese, refried beans, tomatoes and bite-size cubes of potatoes.  In addition to the nachos, I wanted to know what their tamales were doing. Sadly, they were out of the red beef tamales so I got a green corn one just to see. Not so much, not for me, anyway. There wasn't much to it, just a thin layer of green chile inside along with sweet corn. My special lady friend seemed to like it just fine.  I'll probably go back because the nachos were tasty, but I'd have to drive right past the new 2 hippies taco location and that might prove to be a difficult task."}
{"text":"My go-to fast Mexican food fix! I've had delivery, takeout and dine in- a consistent greatness each time. The food is boxed how it should be (ie. no soggy surprises & generous portions). Im a huge Mexican food head.. favorite food is Mexican, always. So I'm choosy, especially with so many options in the valley- this place over delivers for what you pay.. every time!"}
{"text":"On the lookout for lunch when we arrived, many places were closed so I turned to trusty yelp and found this delicious, casual, authentic spot.   Cost to worth it rating: 4  Food: 5, Atmosphere: 3, Service: 3   Eve award: best chimichanga I've ever had, dish of my scottsdale weekend can't stop thinking about   Highlights:  - Chimichanga: Green chili shredded beef not my usual order but had to try when read the rave reviews. It was packed with hidden spice as you can't see green in the meat. Nice contrast and balance when eaten with the shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and guacamole. Surprisingly not greasy for something so fully deep fried and delicious with the generous handful of Thinly shredded cheese which delicately melted on top. I so want another right now.  - Cheese crisps: got introduced to this Arizona treat which caught my eye on the menu. It's a flour tortilla with a lot of melted, crispy cheese on top. Red sauce in the large squeeze bottle was the perfect amount of spice to go with it.  - Seating: indoor area as well as small patio outside   Lowlights:  - Bathroom access: kind of odd you need a key as the bathrooms are inside...  - Corn cheese crisps: figure I'd gluten free it since didn't with the chimichanga, but lady dissed them saying they're a lot smaller and can't get as crispy. That fine, but why don't you take em off the menu then?   Fell in love with this chimichanga from my yelp find and will be back if ever in the area. I honestly was contemplating going back the next day but figure since I was visiting to mix it up a bit."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch after not having had them in a long time. We got the \"daily special\" of 2 tacos with rice and beans -- thinking this was the dish they did well! Nope. It was completely disappointing. Card-paperish shells, \"Taco Bell style\" ground beef, and absolutely bland beans and rice. I actually commented that Taco Bell was better -- and cheaper. They had a sign on the door bragging that they now had horchata -- powdered mix at best.   Definitely save yourself the trip and the money. With all the amazing, reasonably priced Mexican in AZ, steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"Service was so bad took forever to get order one employee screamed I FUC*** UP that's my bad with kids in the place the food was not that greats for the price I expected better food the rice was warned up in a microwave not too fresh I will say the Andes mint they gave me was good but waiting 18 min for 2 taco and rice with no one else waiting for food is very unexceptional also some guy took out garbage then gave a guy his food never washed hands I noticed it"}
{"text":"Food and service was okay.  The guacamole did not seem fresh and neither did the salsa.  Seemed like it was out of the bottle.  Don't think I was be visiting this place again, especially not for the price."}
{"text":"Looking for quick, moderately priced Mexican in Old Town?  El Molino is your answer...  It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot.  I've had chips and salsa, guac, a chicken taco salad, and most recently a bean and cheese burro... I hear the breakfast burritos are pretty delicious as well so I may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover.  Either way, El Molino is a step up from fast food but it's no frills.  Oh, and the people in the Yelp office are huge fans... they are the ones that turned me on to it.  (Gracias amigos!)"}
{"text":"this review is based only on take-out orders, but man, i love this place.  as a los angelino with plenty of family in scottsdale, the food from el molino is a perennial highlight on my couple-times-a-year visits.  the tortillias are seriously incredible, and the green corn tamales are awesome too.  omg and the green sauce.  green chile sauce? i don't even really know what it is called, but it rules.  yay!! i'l be back for our annual christmas eve mexican fiesta!!!"}
{"text":"The service was unfriendly and the owner acted like he was doing me a FAVOR by re-filling my tiny salsa cup \"(I'll do it for you this time; next time there will be a charge.\")  Wha???  Most places refill your chips/salsa until your heart's content.   The ambiance is artsy, which I like, but the seating is uncomfortable and stark.  The food was ok, but nothing special. I had a veggie burro and hubby had cheese enchiladas.  Those were both good, but not great. WAY too pricy for what you actually get, for sure.  Good Mexican?  Los Dos Molinos is a much better bet!"}
{"text":"The service was not the best. I had not eaten at El Molino's since it was near the airport. Back then Carolina's and El Molino's were going toe 2 toe. The food and service has gone downhill, very disappointed"}
{"text":"Got a carne asada burrito and a side of beans.  Both were very good but the price is why I wouldn't recommend or go back. And the side of beans was only a half pint. You can get the same thing at Filberto's for almost half the price. Period. And, the carne asada at Filberto's has onions in it. :]   If you're going to open a small non chain restaurant, you need to either somehow REALLY set yourself apart from other restaurants selling similar foods or the price needs to be roughly the same.  Filberto's on McClintock  & Guadalupe is probably at the very top of every mexican restaurant I've been to. Never been let down."}
{"text":"I swear to God I would give this place seven stars if it were possible. Maybe 8. This is a staple for friends from out of town that I preface with \"Oh you think you have good Mexican food in (blank). You've been lied to. Welcome to El Molino.\"  El Molino purists (usually native Phoenicians and Mexican food addicts, like myself) will go at lengths to remind you that the Scottsdale location now is not its flagship and that El Molino is actually one of the oldest mexican food spots in town. It was originally at 22nd St. and Washington, just east of downtown.   The new location is unassumingly hidden behind a Pizza Hut Express on the corner of Scottsdale and Osborn, but don't be fooled. This place is no fly by night.  Everything here is good, but I especially recommend anything that has the chile beef (the green is a little spicier than the red, but neither is overbearing). Paricularly, and this is my go-to, get the Nana Rosa Special. They make all the tortillas in house and you can taste the freshness in authenticity at its best with this one. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time to Phoenix decided to get delivery since kids wanted to stay in the pool at hotel. Ordered 3 thongs 2 of which had beef at 430 pm and they told me they could only make 2 items because they ran out of meat. Wtf they don't close till 8pm so do you just stop serving Carne asada? Never again...."}
{"text":"I read some great reviews and checked it out....wonderful!  I am already planning my trip back.  Incredibly reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Since moving to old town Scottsdale, we have eaten here numerous times. It is for sure one of my favorite Mexican food places.  Its not over the top. Just really good food and really good service, I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I do agree they have some of the best green sauce but this restaurant fails in so many ways.   When you order you see the buckets of meat sitting there in open air behind counter. Second everything is microwaved. Have you ever microwaved shredded cheese on a styrofoam plate? It's not great.   Better options in old town include America's taco shop and Julio's too where dinner is actually cooked and not thrown on plate and microwaved. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This is not even worth my time to review, but I just don't want anyone else to experience what I had to experience eating at this place. I ordered a beef tamale enchilada style and they nuke it in a microwave. The masa was super dry and no flavor. Even the service wasnt great. Overall don't waste your money and your palette.  Fyi- they don't even deserve a star but had to hit at least 1 star to post this. Que horrible!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review because of Salsa. Yes the pollo quesadilla is amazing. And the burro's are fantastic. There salsa though is out of this world; yes it is expensive, but for good reason. I use to be a regular here, kind of a creature of habit. My love for the spicy side of life was quenched here. There salsa is made with several exotic peppers that can only be found in Mexico. That is why it is over six dollars a pint. The rest of there food is amazing, but pay the extra and get your piece of salsa heaven!"}
{"text":"This place closes at 10. At 845 I ordered online. 25 minutes  later an email cancelling my order saying the restaurant closed early today. Never heard of a restaurant randomly closing an hour or more before they normally do. Bad business."}
{"text":"I really love this place and could eat here every other day!  The chicken tacos crispy are my favorite.  The meat is so tender and flavorful and the cheese is fresh, fluffy and not too salty.  Also, the green corn tamales are better than any I've had.  Always fresh and light and simply outrageous!  The bean and cheese burrito is crazy good too.  The tortillas are the most delightful around.  Very inexpensive and it is locally owned.  The same staff has been there for years and always is friendly and remembers me and that is a nice thing!"}
{"text":"I echo much of  what has been said. The shredded beef burro was very tasty and the beans and rice were just right. My preference would be for more spice - I liked the hot sauce well enough. Four of us ate lunch for under $30 including a couple of sides. They were out of the lemonade, but the iced tea was a good second choice."}
{"text":"Ordered Rolled chicken tacos and a side of rice and beans. I've said this on other reviews and I'll say it again.. I'm a huge critic of Mexican food because honestly it's really hard to mess up. Surprisingly the beans were the best part even though they were not great. The rolled chicken tacos were EXTREMELY DRY(not to mention extremely small)  and the rice was so dry it tasted like bits of cardboard were mixed In. I ate it because I was starving and couldn't leave to go and get anything else. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I used to eat at El Molino a lot when I was younger. Since moving back to AZ (about 2 1/2 yrs ago) I hadn't been back until recently. Honestly, it wasn't AS good as I remembered, but was still very good.   I got a carne asada burrito. I don't know why, but I thought this place used to put a lot of stuff on there burritos (at least cheese), but all it was, was meat, onion & guacamole. Of course, there was salsa on the side (the salsa here it good! both the mild & spicy!). It was good, but the meat was a little dry (they certainly weren't stingy with it, though). Also, the burrito was huge!  My mom got a cheese crisp, which was also huge. She said it was good.  For the price (and the fact that the food is pretty tasty), I'd come back. However, I was expecting to fall back in love with the place after such a long hiatus & sadly that wasn't the case."}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos I've ever had. Not usually crazy about tacos but I never would have thought it possible to be able to make them as good as El Molino does in Scottsdale. Don't go wrong - order machaca beef and try either their chimichanga or the tacos."}
{"text":"This place has good food, but can't ever seem to get an order right. When you mess up my order 3 times in a row, I'm not going to come back. Well, oops, I did come back and they messed my order up AGAIN. No cheese. Simple. I personally don't care how good your food is if you can't get te simple order right."}
{"text":"This falls into my top 5 favorite Mexican places. Their salsa falls close to 1st, they are tied with this hole in the wall I went to in Mazatlan, Mexico. I love spicy salsa to the point I want my mouth to be on fire and I need to take a break! This salsa accomplishes that. Not only is it spicy it has really good flavor too, not just heat."}
{"text":"The original El Molino was established like 80 years ago in downtown Phoenix near 22nd St. & Jefferson.  Grandson Richard Carbajal, Jr. carries on the family recipes and tradition: authentic food at very reasonable prices.  The machaca is always great and I've asked them to ship their award-winning tamales to friends in the far reaches of the known universe.  Their standard hot sauce is of the thin persuasion but very satisfying and their salsa fresca will clear out your sinuses in a hurry!  Grab a couple dozen tamales on your way to that holiday pot luck, and you'll be the center of attention!  Heck, Richard will cater the whole event at a price you can brag about."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."}
{"text":"Don't make the mistake I did: try to eat rice at your computer desk. I'm going to be spending the next hour picking up all my droppings....  Do make the order I made: the Sampler Platter! Yummy! Yummy! It had everything I wanted and more! Delicious!.. can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Was looking for something cheap and quick, ordered from El Molino Cafe. I am very impressed! I got the El Molino Burro Supreme and loved it and the hot sauce had a nice kick to it. I did order mine using post-mates so keep in mind mine wasn't even fresh! I will recommend this to friends!"}
{"text":"Ugh, I'm done with this place.  Tried it a few months back and was not impressed, but decided to give it one more try tonight.  I think the only thing I've liked was the tamale.  My boyfriend liked his enchilada style ground beef burro, but I tried it and didn't care for it.  I had the machaca burro supreme tonight.  The meat was somewhat spicy, but overall it was bland.  The rice has absolutely no flavor, and I love good Mexican rice.  Finally, the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp.  Plus, everything is overpriced.  I will just pick up Taco Bell next time."}
{"text":"Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean.   It used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"And I feel like I got ripped off. Clinton and order one of their specials that said it came with rice and beans. The beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found. The burro was small for $10 and not very filling."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this place, and I've also been inside the restaurant a few times and have met with the owner. They get 5 stars right off the bat for the simple fact that they deliver Mexican food to my house. That's a rarity in this town in and of itself, but the fact that the food was good was a bonus.   People get really picky about their Mexican food here - as they should. Arizona is lousy with Mexican food restaurants. I'm not going to go so far as to say it's the best I've ever had (I've had a lot of Mexican food from a lot of different places), but I will say that it's delicious and consistent. I mean, some of the best places to go get authentic Mexican food in the Valley are dirty little hole in the wall joints that you might be scared to go into. This place is clean and nice and quite a bit more upscale than that.   I wouldn't say the food here is inauthentic either. It's plenty authentic... that word means different things to different people anyway. Some think it means a similar experience to when they visited Rocky Point, and others will cite examples from when they visited Oaxaca or Cabo or Mazatlan, and yet others will compare your favorite place to a chain they like. Who knows. Good food is good food.   My experiences with the staff, management, and owner have been outstanding as well, and I will probably be eating here a lot."}
{"text":"Love the Guacamole !! Been coming for years and never had anything I didn't love.  Gloria and Lupe make you feel like you are in their kitchen cooking just for you.   Try the tamales and the chile relleno. Spectacular!!  They even deliver and cater too!!   I may use them for my holiday party !!!   Love it when Lupe says \"mañana\" when we head out."}
{"text":"This place has been consistently good. The machaca beef chimi is always enough for 2 people, smothered in homemade guac and sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. The rice and beans on the side are also very good and for 10$ you get a soda too. Not freaking bad!   I have only dined in once and the ambiance was okay. Sat on the patio, had a beer and enjoyed a slow afternoon. Just perfect. Since moving up north El Molino has pulled us back a couple of times thanks to its authentic flavors and small business feel.   Takeaway: Good authentic mexican food for cheap. Ambiance isn't much but they do have some good beers on hand to ease the pain. Give it a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with the food. Service was friendly.  Other reviews have summed it up pretty well.  Decent, reasonable, nothing exceptional.  Standard Mex, yo."}
{"text":"My niece got the chicken nachos, which I watched them make:  chips, chicken, beans & chez was placed on a styrofoam plate and then microwaved.  The outcome is a soggy, chewy, mildly flavored slop.  My nephew got 2 beef enchiladas, which were actually ok. Their red sauce was good.  I got the Pepe sampler, which was pretty dull.  The beef and chicken just didn't have a good flavor, although their guac was pretty good.  total with 2 soft drinks and a beer was $32, so not *that* cheap.  I would rather go somewhere that uses real plates and metal silverware and pay an extra $10."}
{"text":"I called in a order and they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. When I arrived the restaurant wasn't busy and I ask for my order. They looked around to see where it was and then the cook then proceeded to start cooking my order. The food is ok but the service just sucked. I'm on a tight schedule for lunch that's why I called it in. I hope they can get their act straight with their service."}
{"text":"foods good but don't order unless you like to try new things, as you won't get what you ordered"}
{"text":"Really mixed feelings about this place.  My green chili burrito was great (spicy as promised) but it was $10 with a small drink.  It felt dingy and dirty inside, not kept up at all.  I've rated it a 3 because of the good food, maybe a bit generous."}
{"text":"Simple, fast, affordable Mexican.  Clean, but nothing fancy--not the type of restaurant for hanging out or meeting friends (no waiters or atmosphere).   Similar in quality to Frank & Lupe's and Los Olivos. Not as good as, but cheaper than Los Sombreros.  Some things are decent, like the enchiladas.  Some are mediocre, like the carne asada. Some are awful, like the chicken salad.  So place your order and keep your fingers crossed.  Great for take-out if you live in Old Town."}
{"text":"I orderd a Mexican pizza today and on the menu it says it only has beef and green chilies and potato on it. I hate onion and tomato and my pizza is covered in it! You need to update your menus! Thanks for the waste of money and 55 minute wait for a delivery!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I was really looking forward to this place.  I saw the menu and it looked delish.  Plus my fellow Yelpers are usually  right on the money with their rating and this place was sporting 4 stars.    I had a $5 credit from Groupon to try Groupon Now, and El Molino was on the list, so I thought, why not.  I even got my brother to come with me.    In summary: Disappointing.    Service: When we arrived and looked through the menu I was really hungry and looking forward to a good meal.  Most of the options are about $8 or $9 so I thought I'd have a great tasting and hearty meal.  The accommodations were fine upon entry.  My brother goes up to the counter and asks what Machaca is.  I speak spanish pretty well, but I wasn't sure, so he asked the guy at the counter (who I think is the owner).  He said, \"You're not from around here.\"  My brother replied, \"I am actually.\"  \"Well you must be new.\"  \"Um, no I've lived here most of my life.\"  I'm not sure why the owner wasn't just polite and answer the question.  Then he mentioned something about being in business for 100 years.  My auditor/CPA brother quickly noticed that it says that they've been in business since 1937 and asked him how he got 100 from 1937.  The owner then mumbled some explanation about being in business for 100 years, but serving food since '37.  Hmm... ok.    Food: I got the Molino Burro Supreme with machaca and a single serving of chips and salsa.  My bro got a chicken enchilada and a machaca taco.     The tortilla tasted like it came from a bag of tortilla off the shelf at safeway.  It was chewey and tasteless.  The beans were ok, but not much better than a can from the grocery store.  The rice was pretty flavorless; white and cheap.  The meat inside the burro had decent flavor, but it was more spice than flavor.    So the burro was a disappointment, what about the chips and salsa?  How can you go wrong with that?  Chips were too dry and hard (I know chips are supposed to be dry and hard, but not this dry or hard).  The salsa was more like spicy tomato paste.   Price: $10 for this meal?  Like someone else said, either this place needs to be a lot cheaper or have a lot better food.  The funny thing was with my Groupon and Groupon credit this place was free, but not even worth that!  SUMMARY: Not impressed.  If you want good flavor go to Fuego Taco, Cafe Rio, or Costa Vida.  Shoot, I would go to Chipotle over this place any day."}
{"text":"I eat here every week... no joke.  I love it.  No frills, but always solid food."}
