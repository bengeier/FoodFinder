{"text":"Great food, but terrible service.

This is an overpriced, pretentious Chinese restaurant that caters mostly to tourists. I used to think it was worth it for a splurge because the food quality is generally much higher than what you'd get elsewhere. But the portion size is tiny for the astronomical prices. And the last two times I went there, the service was slow, rude and inattentive. The waiter didn't even return to check on our table once after serving the food last time, and we waited nearly 30 minutes for the check at the end of the meal.

I'd say save your money and head over to Chinatown for much better fare at much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We had  high expectations, but were we disappointed by the service at this restaurant. Our appetizers came luke warm, but we did not complain. Our water glasses were never refilled, and the dirty dishes stayed on the table for the longest time. But when our entrees arrived ice cold, we did speak up. Our food was removed and reheated, but again the dirty dishes remained on the table. Not once did the waiter or hostess or manager ask how our evening was going. The service was awful, and the manager refused to come and talk with us.  For better service, food and prices go to Mr. MA around the corner."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food you'll have anywhere in your life.  It's pricey, but fantastic....and they have a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Located in downtown, because the great location, may cost a lot. 4 person spent $ 50 each! No parking as well! Spent another $10 for that!"}
{"text":"The dumplings here are amazing. Seriously good.

The rest is good, but it is EXTREMELY expensive. For two of us, with two entrees, two apps, and a half bottle of sake it was $125 not including tip. The ambiance is beautiful and the service is amazing, but...seriously...I would go cheaper and I am pretty sure you could do well.

Given that the restaurant was pretty bare and it was a Friday night (given, the Canadiens were in the Stanley Cup playoffs and it was Good Friday...) I just think they may have priced themselves out of a market despite the very good food."}
{"text":"Le plus chic des restorants chnois de montréal! Pour grandes occasions. Souper d'affaires ou anniversaires. Service impécable. Décor très impressionnant. Cliquant un peu mais wow!"}
{"text":"The Piment Rouge is closed!

But....

...Le Piment 2 is opened.

Same wonderful team

Same great food

1/2 the price...I kid you not.

General Tao chicken; crispy sesame beef and try the new soups...they are a hearty meal!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the decor and service at Le Piment Rouge was stellar. The waiters were top notch and completely went out of their way to make our dinner excellent. 

Besides that, the food was ordinary. Definitely nothing spectacular or deeming the extravagant prices. I had 4 courses, each being good but not great. 

I'm not opposed to a lavish dinner every once in a while, but if we're spending hundreds of dollars, I would hope the food would amaze, inspire, or satisfy me. 

Sadly, Le Piment Rouge did none of the above."}
{"text":"I find the service to be poor. Waiters were not helpful, and hardly attentive. Service was slow. They also did not have the usual practice of bringing up the dishes one course at a time. Instead, all dishes were served together, and piled onto one plate. Sauces mixed together and you lose the enjoyment of tasting each dish purely. 
I will not go back nor ever bring my business guests there again."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn rating this place as I would have given them 5 stars based on our first visit. My husband and I were dining out and everything was perfect from service to food.

Because of the great experience, we thought we'd take the family out during Father's Day. This turned out to be a bit of a nightmare. I don't know if the chefs changed completely or there's a different chef on different evenings of the week, but the food was not great. It was just mediocre. On top of that, the service was way off. There were 7 of us that evening and they couldn't remember what each person had. Unlike the first time where they delicately placed the food and settings in front of you, there was a lot of \"clanging\". It took forever to get the server's attention and to get our bill.

My in-laws' were not impressed. We understand the experience would be expensive considering they are located in the Windsor, but everything else should be top notch or else what would differentiate it from any other Chinese restaurant where it's a fraction of the cost.

My husband and I would like to give it another chance, but not sure when."}
{"text":"Great venue, but the food was horrible, bland.  Presentation was good.  Way over priced."}
