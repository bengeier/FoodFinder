{"text":"Good prices and very filling with plenty of protein packed into a roti wrap. The wrap is made of a thin bread almost as thin as a crepe with chick pea flour. Then a curry filling is placed on it and wrapped up. It's a simple tasting food that's hearty if a bit heavy. Spicees still remains the standard that I compare all other rotis too. Takeout only and cash only. $7.50 (including tax, menu prices all include tax already) for a chicken (without bones) roti and a tad more for other meats such as beef, goat and shrimp. You can mix it with channa (aka chick peas) or potatoes. You can also buy the roti breads by themselves. They also offer doubles (essentially small sandwiches, a filling in between two fried flatbreads called bara) and patties (and even badly shaped patties at a discount)."}
{"text":"a.k.a. Mister Spicee, a.k.a. Spicee's  Thirty+ years in the business and still one of Montreal's greatest hidden treasures.  Quite simply my favorite Trini hole-in-the-wall bakery/take-out joint in--and probably my favorite West Indian of any stripe--in Montreal.  The menu is short and sweet, but cheap eats don't get any cheaper or better.  Mister Spicee does a brisk trade in rotis, but, in my opinion, their house-made patties and phenomenal doubles are the standouts.  Make sure to request hot sauce and tamarind sauce when you place your doubles order.  Never had doubles?  Order the chicken and chickpeas double and you get a heap of fresh, shredded chicken curried with chickpeas, sandwiched between a couple of steaming hot flatbreads, and slathered with the two house sauces.  Sure, it's a little on the messy side, but, man, is it ever sensational.  Accompany with ginger beer.  Repeat as needed."}
