{"text":"Very small mom and pop business inside AMPM convenience store. Service is excellent. The owner is extremely friendly. Food is good and for an excellent price. You can get 2 tacos with salad, rice and chips for $4.00 There's a wide variety of seafood mexican dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Certainly a hidden gem located inside a gas station. The food was amazing with great portions. The burrito I ordered came with salad, chips, refried beans and salsa for a great price. The service was expectational and the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for casual comfort Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"in a gas station, YES A GAS STATION!  I honestly can say I had my doubts. So being the optimistic kind of guy that I am, I gave it a soft try. \"1 shrimp cocktail to go please.\" And man o man am I impressed.  Only 10$ for it. Was really good.. nextime ima try the food..  I was surprised.. I will return 4sure....   I have returned. It is Really good. Hard to believe my new favorite taquira is in a gas station. Ordered a wet burrito which came with rice and beans.. DELICIOUS!  My girl had the sopes. Those were on hit too. I'm impressed with this place and the prices are reasonable.  And yes I get the shrimp cocktail every time. So good on a hot day. It was loaded with shrimp.. love this place. A true hidden gem  Ps. I should have posted pics of my food. But I ate that shit!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and reasonable prices, will definetly go back again, tbey have different types of food"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food. Love it here and would def. come back. The customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"One of the Mexican food in this side of town..... el gobernador tacos 4 for $10...highly recommend and the asada tacos especial $5.50 3 tacos rice and beans wow..."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever, and our cook/server brought freshly made verde salsa to our table. We were skeptical with this hidden gem being located inside an AM PM Mini Mart, but it's clean and there are tables inside to sit and eat, and best of all the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! This place is truest a hidden gem.  First off the food is cheap & delicious.  When I walked in at 5pm on a thurs there was nobody there so the guy popped up and made my food to order.  He was very polite and quick the entire experience.  He started making it before I paid him and then I walked up to him and paid him the cash before he finished preparing so he promptly washed his hands immediately after touching the dirty money.  Later the phone rang and after the call ended it was nice to see him immediately wash his hands again.  My food was still done within 10 mins.  I got 3 carne asada tacos with beans/rice/tortilla chips, with red & green salsas...all of it was delicious and with fresh ingredients!  This place is inside the ampm gas station, but it is a legit restaurant.  Everything is fairly cheap...I'm blown away.  I will probably be back here at least 5x/week...it's such a great value if you like authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"They changed the meat they use for their carne asada tacos. This used to be my favorite restaurant to eat at, going multiple times a week. Unless they bring back the better quality meat that they used to use, I won't be back. Unfortunately tonight I threw my food away. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm giving it extra stars because it's hidden in a gas station. Pretty good food and bang for your buck. One of the best deals was 2 Tacos w/ rice, salad and beans for around $5. The gas station mini mart even has aguas frescas at their fountain machine. Be prepared, they take cash only."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good, this a family business place is and their fish tacos are amazing!! I'm definitely gonna be coming more!"}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp cocktail to go and it was amazing !! Huge 32 oz cup, Served with lots of chips & saltines. Oh and their green salsa is perfecto. All for only $10! I'll be a regular customer for sure !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It took me a while to find it because I didn't realize it was inside the gas station. The owner is so welcoming and portion sizes are more than generous. So delicious and authentic.  Only accepts cash as payment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing it kills Robertos...Family owned food is always good and the staff is friendly!!"}
{"text":"Whole family got food poisoning. Still dealing with it. My wife, daughter (2 years old) and myself. I've had this place before and it's always been decent. My wife got the beef chimichanga. I got a steak burrito. I'll never go back. Not really angry but just thought everyone should know."}
{"text":"Located inside of a AMPM gas station.  Food was fresh and flavorful!!!!  We ordered Ceviche, Menudo, and Camarones Adios.  All dishes were AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Mexican restaurant on this side of town let alone a good Mexican seafood joint. This place is a hidden jem! It is inside the AM/PM! Food was good and so is the service!! We ordered tacos and the mixed ceviche. Both were delicious! I can wait to bring people here.... make sure to bring cash. If you forget you can get cash back from the AM/PM cashier."}
{"text":"i wanted to use a restaurant.com gift card here but didnt know it was inside of an ampm.. also its called mariscos el tapatio but on the me√±u theres no seafood options."}
{"text":"This restaurant is more hidden than some speakeasies.  I swear Sasquatch would be easier to find.  Important information you need to know about this place, it is in the back of the AM/PM.  Make sure you go through the doors of the AM/PM.  After you go through the doors, use your Indiana Jones skills to explore through the AM/PM until you get to the back.  Once you get to the back, you will find this lost treasure of a restaurant.  Great authentic Mexican seafood.  Try the Pina Rellano.  This is half of a pineapple filled with seafood and meat.  Once you finish your meal, you will be happy that you went on this lost crusade."}
{"text":"The grad student in me is rejoicing for finding a good deal in Mariscos el Tapatio. The money I'm saving here is going straight to coffee to fuel me for more study seshes.   It's a great, small shop inside the am/pm that's run by one man. When I came by, he was sleeping but he woke up when I came by. I ordered 4 carne asada tacos to test the waters of this place. He washed his hands and got to grilling. It was really quick and fresh.  It's got a lot of flavor and the salsas you get are spicy and tasty. It won't burn your tongue off but it's got a nice heat to it. The order comes with rice, beans, and chips which is a nice touch. The tacos themselves are solid. They're exactly what you'd expect a carne asada taco would be and for the price, it's great.  I paid $7 for 4 tacos, beans, rice, and chips. Coming from California, I'm used to $0.50 or $1 tacos, but dang, this is a good deal for the Vegas valley.  Overall, I'm excited to come back and try ceviche, al pastor tacos, tortas, etc. The owner is so nice and friendly that I want to spread the word. Definitely go try it for yourself! You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place since it got 7 reviews  all with 5 stars.  When looking for this place I thought it closed down and when I called a guy said they are inside am/pm.  Didn't think much of it until I walked in.  It looked like a storage room that was converted to rent out.  We figured we were already here and decided to try it since we were the only customer there. O.o  Ordered the carne asada which was ok but the fries were soggy and greasy.  That was gross and deserve a 1 rating.  3 tacos which the canitas and carne asada was ok, but the Al pastor smelled like the meat was old.  Threw that away, didn't feel like asking for a new one  My wife ordered the mix seafood which tasted bland, but adding salt and lemon helped.    When we left we smelled like the kitchen since the ventilation was not turned on until they finished cooking.  This was an experience we will probably not return to anytime."}
{"text":"This place is on Pyle right inside the gas station. I've been wanting to go there for a while now I finally did and these are the best tacos and burritos, in fact all the food is good the only thing is you have to have cash which is no problem. This is the place I go to when I want tacos or want to try something new."}
{"text":"This little secret place inside am/pm is such a great addition to the neighborhood. Great menu with an awesome taco lunch special sniper authentic and great menu items."}
{"text":"Really good food highly recommend it and yes it is in the the ampm gas station. If you like seafood and mariscos check it out."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Great taste.  its amazing. folks are friendly and the portions are good size.  love the fact that is close to my house.  I no longer have to go to the las vegas for good mariscos."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. It's nearly impossible to believe it's here, because it's located inside the AmPm. They are cash only, and only have a select soda menu. You can get a drink at AmPm though. Probably the best carne asada in south Las Vegas."}
