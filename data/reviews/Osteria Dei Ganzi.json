{"text":"First hand I was impressed by the atmosphere, the heritage of the building the detail, it was convertible to be there. We ordered our food and it took about 35 min for the first dish to arrive, the second another 35 min. I ordered a drink because my paste was a bite spicy and another 35 min. I was looking for eavestrough for some kind if water to cool my mouth off but the drink came. Lucky the place wasn't that busy or I'll take my drink to go!  Anyways the food was excellent but the service was 2 stars. I'll probably go again maybe!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the good - the cocktails are delicious and service is good. Unfortunately, it ends there -- the food is beyond bad. Probably some of the worst I've had in the city. 

We ordered quite a bit a bit of food and there was not a single good dish. 

- The bread at the beginning is basically toasted pita. I think they're trying to pawn it off as focaccia? 
- Pretty sure the calamari was pre-battered and frozen. We couldn't even finish them and they're usually my favourite item on any menu. 
- The caponata crostini were on a stale baguette-ish bread, or maybe a sub bun? Smothered in something more akin to cheez whiz than asiago. 
- The beef carpaccio was actually Bresaola, which is a cured meat....so, not carpaccio at all! It was covered by what looked like pre-cut romaine out of a salad mix bag..a little dry with some random vegetables thrown in.
- As a main, we got a pulled beef pizza. The beef tasted old and the pizza was overly-salted and very soggy. And not the good, Napoleatan type of soggy. It was just drenched in liquid! Terrible. 

Overall, I would not go back to Osteria if you paid me."}
{"text":"We visited Osteria Dei Ganzi with a group of 13 people on July 5th. We had a reservation and waited about 5 minutes for our table to be put together, which is acceptable. 

Once seated we were given the Summerlicious menu, which was a three course set menu at $25 and were told that we MUST order from it as we were a larger group. I asked the hostess how large groups order when it is not Summerlicious and she stated from the regular menu. I suggested that we should be able to do the same and our request was accommodated. 

I ordered the Ganzi Insalata Dell 'Orto salad and added chicken. When the salad came out it was soooo tiny and was made with a pinch of mixed greens, candied walnuts, croutons, asiago cheese with house dressing. There was also suppose to be pancetta croccante  however there was none on my salad, which I only realised as I re-read the menu to write this review. The amount of chicken was so small, over cooked and tasted like grilled cardboard. As I was a bit shocked at the small size, I asked our server if this was $17 dollar salad I had ordered  He promptly took it back to the kitchen and returned with a slightly larger salad. 

I also had the White Lady *5 cocktail which was good but very small. Also, it did not have orange liquor in it. 

Everyones food came out at different times and rest of our group expressed that their meals were also mediocre at the very best.

Our server was fine and to be honest I felt bad that he works here.

There are so many wonderful restaurants in this city I highly suggest that you do not waste your time visiting Ganzi."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely amazing night at Osteria dei Ganzi! Fantastic food, great atmosphere, friendly service. I'll definitely be going back. I can't wait to try their patio!"}
{"text":"Had to wait 20 minutes even after making a reservation. Service was friendly but very very delayed. Food was good but not worth the hassle for service. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to enter into this wonderful building and was quite pleased upon entering Osteria dei Ganzi- the decor was retro-Italianita and tastefully done. I was meeting up with some friends for our weekly dinner get-together that we have established for a number of years now. We are quite educated in restaurants and wine. But, I was sadly disappointed for a number of reasons. The service was horrible and I am not exaggerating in the sense where the waitress forgot a fork. We were not attended to all,  we had to seek out help which at times was hard to find, our food was late or didn't come at all -we were all in disbelief. 
The ironic fact was that the table next to us (a group of men some of whom were Toronto restauranters were present) had not 1 waitress but three, the food kept coming, the wine was being poured and they  truly enjoyed their Ganzi experience. Things that make you go hmmm"}
{"text":"We came back on the managers invitation and have to say that the meal and dining experience was fantastic. The staff were attentive and funny. They listened to our dietary needs and produced standout meals. The cocktails are STARS here. Wow! Perfect balance for each of our tastes. The calamari was well prepared with a nice spicy salsa side and aioli. I had the arugula salad with toasted almonds and pears. Our chef special included salmon with grilled veggies (including my fave red and yellow peppers). My husband had the tiramisu and I drooled over it (will come back after my cleanse to try it for sure)."}
{"text":"i came to this place really wanting to like it. i was with a few friends on the patio to have some drinks. first - we ordered some red sangria even though it is not on the drink list - and would not have when we found out it was $40 for a pitcher! even worse after a 25 min wait for it, we were brought white wine sangria.. they eventually fixed it. however, the sangria was not good.. especially at that price. we then wanted some food but they had run out of pizza dough.. so we ordered some calamari which was delicious and a cheese board.. just so you know you get a few pieces of cheese and maybe 3 pieces of break for $18.50. the service was offensively slow.. and i am the last person to complain at a restaurant but the whole experience was just unacceptable especially for the prices they are charging. very disappointing because there is great potential here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. The food is imaginative and delicious while the decor leaves the impression you're visiting a posh, bohemian restaurant of another time. 

I'm always surprised that it isn't that busy but the prices aren't exactly cheap either. The service can be spotty and slow but it's a great atmosphere for conversation so I don't mind so much."}
{"text":"Great place for group holiday get together, the server was very friendly and knowledgeable and recommended us to split the dishes instead of ordering separate plates. I was particularly impressed with the calamari as it was very juicy and is not like chewing gum so you are not spending the next 5 minutes just chewing on that one piece of calamari (I'm sure we have all been there at one point). 

We had ordered a bottle of Cab Sauv, but he also recommended us to try the Enzo Vincenzo Valpolocella Ripasso and gave us a small sample to try. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely be ordering next time. 

Prices for each dish was around $12-$20 and bottles of red start from $35 which I thought was pretty reasonable for a holiday dinner. The restaurant also has unique decor and exterior which is definitely a nice extra touch."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of trying a new restaurant stay far away from Osteria Dei Ganzi!!! I am proud to say I enjoy going for dinner with family, friends & having a good meal. You would probably call me a foodie & I'm ok with that. So, when a friend of mine suggested this new restaurant I was excited to try it.  

Well if I knew that I would have to wait for more then 2 hours for our meal I would have thought twice. Aside from that, we had two different waitresses take different parts of our order, which wouldn't have been bad if after about 30 minutes one of them didn't come back to the table to find out what my appetizer order was. Unfortunately they both looked lost!  

After an hour & a half of being at the restaurant without being served, the Chef, who had come out to see another table & saw we had nothing on our table but a bottle of wine. He came over to talk to us & as nice as he was to bring us mini pizzas & rice balls while we were waiting, unfortunately the rice balls were frozen in the middle!  

Shortly after, they proceeded to bring my appetizer, my friend's pizza & another friend's appetizer & pasta dish. By the time she finished her appetizer, her pasta was cold. By 10pm, 1 appetizer & 2 pizza's were still missing from the table. At one point they brought the pizza's out & were so confused they brought them back to the kitchen, even after I told them they were ours. The waitresses never returned to our table after they took our orders, not to apologize or ask if we needed anything.  

At this point we asked to speak to a manager that sincerely apologized & then we asked to speak to the owner. Luca Viscardi, previous owner of Toula, was extremely arrogant, although he apologized & took care of our bill, it was not sincere. They continued to offer us more wine, dessert, coffee & champagne, which we refused. This was not about getting a free meal or free drinks, but when you see a table where only half the guests are eating you should realize there is a problem. It would have been much better if the wait staff checked in on us every once in a while.  

When going to a restaurant, you expect to be served a meal & have good service. Growing up in the restaurant business & being a member of the service industry myself, I expect to be treated with the same respect as all other customers. Other patrons, as well as the other owner had no problem at his table. Needless to say we will not be returning to this restaurant & we discourage you to go as well!"}
{"text":"Luca, Dan and executive Master Chef Guerrino Staropoli set out to serve authentic Italian cuisine that is simple and unpretentious. And that they've achieved. 

The arancini, fried taggiasche olives and homemade piccanti sauce were divine!

The cured meats on their misto board were to die for and would alone be a reason for us to go back! We weren't huge fans of the cheeses, but to each his own (they also rotate the selection to spice things up - so there is hope for us next time).

The chef has one of the tastiest homemade pizza sauces I've had. It was rich, the perfect consistency and not too acidic. Topped with buffalo mozzarella, calabria sausage, fresh diavolini peppers, provolone and portobello mushrooms, we thought the Piccante pizza was spot on.

The mansion has charm oozing from its every crevice (sit inside by one of the fireplaces for the full effect)."}
{"text":"The one star is purely for the effort that went into the decor and  presentation of this restaurant. Job well done to the designer! The service and food were poor, and I will not be returning to this much hyped restaurant. I made a reservation 2 days ahead hoping to score a nice table. We were greeted and straight away seated in the worst corner of one of the many rooms although the place was only about 20% full. Then we were greeted by a very inexperienced waitress, who sounded 'rehearsed' for lack of a better description. We requested for a better table, she returned in 5 minutes saying ' unfortunately they were completely booked so we have to stay at our current table'. We were confused and looked around at at least 5 empty tables of 2 and asked... Surely you're not completely booked? Her response was that there was nothing she could do. The food was less than mediocre.... Sorry to say, didn't taste like the creation of a chef but rather a shortcut produced by a cook that may have been hired on a budget. Overall, they reek of inexperienced staff, poor management and clueless running of what sounded like a great new addition to Torontos Italian scene. There appear to be more staff than guests, but that may be because we were at the worst table, at the entrance, a place much better suited for a plant or a coat rack, and not a guest table. Sort your management out, and make your focus your food, as you so elegantly do so on your misleading website. A Saturday night out should be a pleasing and comfortable experience, not an underachieving show of restaurant management. Hope you're doing better in 6 months!"}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant, horrible food and way overpriced! There! No need for a long review!
Run away from that place!!!"}
{"text":"We came down here for summerlicious, but I wan't impressed overall....

I guess this restaurant targets toward more to the ppl around the area? They don't have parking space at all. They have a private parking lot, but it could only fit in around 8 cars in total, and you have to pay for parking outside.

for the summerlicious, I had the scallop, steak, and strawberry cheesecake.

scallop,
it was alright, it just tasted like cooked scallop, and the sauce was not much of a surprised....

steak,
I ordered a mid-rare steaj, but it came out a bit more than mid-rare cook. For a set dinner of $25, I guess you don't get high quality steak, but sometimes you will taste \"depth\" in the sauce or something, not this time. and I should of order \"rare\" instead....
but why put it on the menu if it is just not that great?
There were some veg on the side of the steak, but 50% of them got burned up. What i mean is....the side of the veg, ex potato, were all black and thick...
overall the steak tasted like a cooked beef...

strawberry cheesecake,
this one is not bad, and its decent...

at the end, the waitress was taking our plate away but spilled something to my phone. Yes...its my fault to put the phone on the table, and I didn't say anything to them at all, and my phone still works, but what if someone wore an expensive dress or shirt or how about on someone's hair?

Anyways, overall the experience was so so. For $25 of summerlicious, I could find a better restaurant elsewhere who will also have the same price tag..."}
{"text":"With the recent opening of Osteria dei Ganzi, we decided to make it our next Thursday night dinner destination; but, what was planned to be a simple traditional dinner, ended up as a far from enjoyable experience.  
 
I arrived at the restaurant just before our 8pm reservation for 4 people, and was seated immediately.  It didn't take long to notice that the historic mansion was nicely decorated with a beautiful chandelier up front, and some vibrant classic italian artwork on the walls.  I must say - job well done on the appearances front; but as the saying goes \"appearances can be deceiving\".  I've grown up around restaurants and dined out enough to know that the mark of a good restaurant is not necessarily its size or decor, but rather the quality of its food and the generosity and genuineness of its staff.  Along that line, some of the finest dining experiences I have had have been in this very city, unfortunately Ganzi is not among them. 

Overall, I found the service to be quite slow, and the staff to be unattentive.
It took a while for even a waitress to approach us with water, let alone a drink or even a drink menu for that matter.  After approximately an hour and a half of being in the restaurant without being served anything besides wine, a smiling chef walked past our table, so we called him over and he introduced himself as Guerrino.  When he asked how we were, we indicated that we had placed our order an hour and a half ago, but we had yet to receive anything beyond our bottle of wine.  Guerrino looked around the table frantically, and said he would come back with something.  About ten minutes later he came over with a plate of 4 rice balls and 4 crostinis.  We were thankful for his kindness, but still confused as to what was going on, as we were not provided with an explanation, and there was no sign of our order coming any time soon.  Sadly, the rice balls were frozen in the middle (clearly just microwaved, but not well enough), which just added to the really bad taste in my mouth (both figuratively and literally) for Ganzi.
 
Some time later, they proceeded to bring 2 of the 3 appetizers, along with one of the main dishes (papperdelle pasta).  Following that, the second main dish arrived ( margherita pizza).  We figured the remaining two mains would come out shortly, so we advised our friends to start eating so their food would not go cold.  At one point two servers brought out what looked like the remaining two main dishes (piccante pizzas), but proceeded to take them back to the kitchen with confused looks on their faces, even after one of my friends had nicely indicated that they likely belonged to our table.  Unfortunately, the 2 pizzas, and not to mention the 1 appetizer, never arrived.  As it was now 10pm, I asked one of the waitresses if I could speak to the Manager.  She called him out and he came to speak to us.  I explained the situation to him, and he was the first person to apologize and indicated that our orders had been missed.  He then said he would have our pizzas out in 5 minutes, even after I told him that he could just cancel the order at that point.  I fully understand that opening a restaurant is a complicated business, and there is a lot to manage, and rarely does a restaurant open and become an overnight sucess.  Things don't always go as planned; but at the same time, it doesn't even take an experienced restauranteur or even a waitress/server to realize that something is wrong when you have a table of four and two of the guests have not been served anything for over two hours.  I felt bad for the Manager as it was only his second week on the job, and asked to speak to the owner Luca Viscardi.  When Luca came over to speak with us he was extremely arrogant, and although he gave a half-hearted apology and took care of the bill, it was anything but sincere.  He later sent over some servers offering champagne which we refused, as this was not about getting a free drinks, but rather to be treated genuinely with respect - it all boils down to good customer service, which Luca could clearly use a refresher course in (not to mention restaurant management). 

What I found even more ironic was that their website claims that Ganzi prides itself on 'a philosphy that suggests that life as it's happening in the moment, is to savoured and enjoyed - La Dolce Vita!'  Well Ganzi, if only you truly believed your own mission statement, as our experience was far from something to be savoured or enjoyed.  In fact, visiting Ganzi was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone else.  If you are tempted by the photos and recent hype of this new resto, my advice to you is that you are better off bringing your camera to this restaurant than your appetite.
 
Good luck to you Ganzi - the restaurant business in Toronto is a tough one to compete in - clearly you have a long way to go to achieve 'la dolce vita' you advertise!"}
{"text":"Ambience is amazing!!! The staff (most often) very friendly. The food unfortunately is sooooo mediocre. Think boston pizza caliber. The starter platter was a selection straight out of loblaws. The dessert was horrible and as was the. Ravioli...which is unfortunate because I love ravioli. The pasta wasn't even hand made. The ambience visited only reason this place gets a two. Free parking In the back but it's usually full."}
{"text":"Perfectly competent Italian resto in a somewhat inaccessible area.  We were lucky to get street parking right in front on Jarvis, although maybe it wasn't really luck since the place was half empty on a Saturday night in June.

Food was fine, run of the mill Italian fare, wine prices and selection were average for a place that fancies itself an \"upscale\" Italian bistro.  i'd probably go back if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to dine again."}
{"text":"Went for New Years (2014) the grand opening. Super friendly staff, even better food, wonderful atmosphere and great drink selection. A very unique and authentic Toronto experience."}
{"text":"The ambiance was delightful, and the food was authentic, just the way Mario and Luigi's Nonna would have made it.
We ordered the fried olives ( expected something different but were pleasantly surprised), prosciutto fried fior Di latte ( nice and light), arancini, fettucine and piccante pizza.

Nice twist on drinks. Surprised to see some famous New Orleans drinks on the menu as well, made by in house mixologist K-Fed.

Service was a little slow- but the food and atmosphere were nice!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 3-stars for the food but I added another star just for the service.  We went as a very large group for a surprise birthday dinner party for a friend, and our waiter was extremely accommodating and all around, just a great guy.  He was attentive to the fact that a surprise birthday includes the surprise part so he made sure he closed the doors that led to our dining area so our friend was genuinely surprised when he came in!  Also he was sure to consistently come around to ask if we wanted to order any drinks, get refills, etc. and had a positive,upbeat attitude the whole time.

As for the location: easy to find, right across Keg Mansion on Jarvis and situated in a very old building dating back to the mid 1800s.  Apparently most of the ceiling work in this building is original so make sure you have a look if you're dining in one of the rooms.  The washrooms are downstairs and a bit cramped, but will do in a pinch if you realy need to go.  The decor is very 1920s-1940s feel, which fits with this building.  The atmosphere was quite lively and loud in the main dining areas, so it would be a great place to have dinner with friends but not for quiet, intimate dates.

Now for the food: 

They give you baskets of bread to start with balsamic vinegar/olive oil bottles so you can dip the bread in whatever you wish.

Appetizer: Melanzane Alla Parmigiana - delicious friend eggplant with fresh tomato sauce, basil and buffalo mozzarella.  And by delicious, I mean absolutely a must-try if you come to this place.

Main: I ordered the Penne All' Arrabiata which is penne with tomato, extra virgin olive oil and fresh chili peppers.  The way they made this sauce was really good...definitely the most unique and yummy penne I have eaten.  The chilli peppers added a nice 'kick' to the taste while not making the dish unbearably spicy.  My bf, who does not usually eat spicy food, really liked this dish as well.  I will be ordering another dish to try next time, just so I can try more variety on their menu.

The bf ordered Porchetta pizza, so it was topped with braised pork, fior di latte, roasted peppers, onions and tomato sauce.  He's a big pizza fan and really liked this pizza.

The portions were good, so by the time we finished eating, we were too stuffed to order dessert since our friend's birthday cake was being served.  One thing they do charge if you are thinking of having a birthday event here is the cake cutting fee, which for our large group of approximately 20 people, meant $50 fee.  Our waiter already notified about this when we reserved the table, so it was not a shock.

The waiter gave us a combined bill initiallly but made sure to come back and split the bill for us after we told him some of the guests wanted to pay using card while others had cash.  Very courteous and friendly throughout the entire evening.

Overall, I do recommend a visit here if you are into Italian food.  They have something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"After hearing about their amazing patio, I had to try it for myself with a few of my girlfriends on a Sunday.  Osteria Dei Ganzi, better known as Ganzi Toronto is right on Jarvis St. and Wellesley.  It's about a 5-10 minute walk from Wellesley Station. 

We ordered a few plates to share.  Above is the Misto Woodboard - an assorted selection of Italian cold cuts and imported cheeses, served with arancini.  Loved the variety and the freshness of the cheeses & meats.  Recommended if you're there for a few drinks and need some grub or if you're sharing a few plates with your friends like I did.

Ganzi's mixologist, Joao made us a GIANT & beautiful bowl of white sangria with oranges, fig, peaches... can't remember what else.  It was refreshing, delicious and cooling.  It was hard to scoop up the sangria into our wine glasses however because the scoop was too big.

Eggs Benedettina - poached eggs on toasted garlic rosemary focaccia, served with ham-cheese & mortadella roulade, topped with creamy parmiggiano sauce.  This is from the Brunch menu and all dishes with eggs came with home fries, fried banana peppers and lentil ragout.

Steak Tagliata & Eggs.  Of course we couldn't resist a steak dish.  This came with 3 scrambled eggs and AAA black angus steak served with spicy dandelion and piadine.  The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and we enjoyed this the most from the Brunch menu.  Highly recommended! 

Piccante Pizza is made with tomato, calabria sausage or chicken (we got chicken), portobello mushroom, fresh sliced diavolini (chili) peppers, provolone and buffalo mozzarella cheese.  This is very tasty as it has a lot of flavours and the right acidity in ingredients. 

Meat Cannelloni was an example of simple things that are done just right.  Made with tomato, thyme, and parmiggiano cheese, even when there's not a slew of ingredients, it was seasoned perfectly and the Cannelloni was cooked well too.

Tried a Frittelle Italiane for the first time!  Italian donuts with apricot & mango filling.  If you don't like things that are too sweet, this has just enough sweetness from the filling and the donut itself it soft and chewy - a perfect combination.

The Tiramisu was delicious.  It doesn't overwhelm with coffee as there's just the right amount.  I will go back just for this!

Had the best time here.  Great service, great foood and great patio - best spot in the summer!"}
{"text":"This place is right next door to my old house- so its an extension of my kitchen!
It used to be the old Honey's Beestro, which closed down (cause it was crap) Ganzi is AMAZING! The service in impeccable, the waiter remembered my wine of choice and name after I had not been there for a year! The food is incredible, seasonal, and while it is on the pricier end, I have never been disappointed! The decor is amazing and a great place for a private function. I LOVE IT HERE! 

This place is always full of hot chicks!!"}
{"text":"The location and venue is great, it's a mansion that has been converted into a restaurant like the Keg mansion across the street.  However, unlike the Keg, this place is relatively quiet and not even half full most of the time because it's so brand new.   I found the service staff actually quite friendly and plenty of them around all the time to serve you.  The food is just ok in general.  I had the homemade gnocchi which was a tad overcooked as it was a bit too mushy.  It tasted ok, but the portion size was really small.   The Pappadelle which was a decent size and tasted good from the sample bites I stole off my friends.  For dessert we had the Trio, which was excellent.  I can see this place with great potential once it gets more word of mouth and people in the place to create more buzz."}
{"text":"The combination of superb Italian fare, excellent interior design with reclaimed wood against the period architecture of this Jarvis St. mansion, plus the attentive and knowledgeable staff make me a fan of Osteria dei Ganzi. The 200 seat patio right on front overlooking Jarvis wraps around the building with majestic steps leading up into the dining area and bar. Incredibly luscious and at the same time decadent, the stately interior made me feel like I was in a movie set somewhere in Europe. At the Roman Yelp event we were served with scrumptious appetizers and drinks which are a teaser to what a full meal would be like here and after meeting the manager and chef I have no doubt that a return visit would be memorable."}
{"text":"At first the female waitress seemed unorganized and didn't seem to care about customer service because she completely forgot to bring out the drinks we ordered then didn't even come back to take our order. However we soon got these two very friendly male waiters who weren't just friendly but helpful and very quick with our orders. food was great and the atmosphere is great and quiet."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch and drinks at this beautifully renovated new restaurant - The place looks great inside and out. Service was pretty good although our bus boy seemed to be doing more serving than our actual server. But she wasn't bad he was just more engaging and active in delivering drinks and food.  

We had Cesars which were made well, but had horseradish so had to send it back for a remake ( we hate horseradish) which they did no problem. The flavors were balanced very well. 

We had the calamari and it was calamari. Not bad but nothing to phone home about. 

Next we tried the margarita Pizza and it was delicious ! Very fresh tasting and light.  

House cocktails were priced 14-19$ and although I'm sure they're worth it, It seems a little steep for the area...and in comparison to the food prices which are quite reasonable. 

Overall we were happy. Would return for more piZza .... Cute spot for a date somewhere you want to be lo key."}
{"text":"Nope. This place was not very good.

It's a really cool space, inside an old house, they've got a nice outdoor bar and cute outdoor seating, plus it's really good for seating a group inside a huge \"dining room\" area. 

The food was just not that great. I got a salad, and it really really sucked. How does one screw up a salad? I have no idea, but it was terrible. Also, I had a bite of my friends dishes (can't remember what they are) and they were all crappy too. I wished this place was better."}
{"text":"This place is unpretentious with simple italian fare that is freshly sourced and freshly made. I had the tagliatelle which I thought was lacking in mushrooms, but the sauce was very well done, the pasta al dente as it should be, and you could tell that they made it that morning. A friend and I were there for PaintNight which they host on a weekly basis in their dining room. We ended the night hanging out at the bar where both the bartender, and one of the owners were super friendly. Watching the bartender serve mixed drinks is really amazing, you can tell he really loves what he does and is part of the resurging cocktail culture in Toronto. This spot also has very accessible parking for those coming in from out of town. And the decor is very nice, great place for a first date if you're worried that your date and you might not have much in the way of conversation, since you can just look around and find something to comment on."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner for two from the Summerlicious menu. Sat outside on the patio, which was nice. Service was prompt and friendly. However, the food was disappointing. I ordered the scallops for apps, pizza for main, and gelato for dessert. My date ordered soup, fish & risotto, and tiramisu. The scallops were good, the margherita pizza wasn't bad, and the rest seemed like it was out of the frozen section of a supermarket. Both the desserts were incredibly bad and of low quality and we took two bites of each and left the rest. 

They are apparently known for their fancy drinks menu. I asked for a non-sweet drink that the waiter could recommend and got something so sweet and sugary that it had  a gloop of sugar at the bottom of the glass. Told the server. Didn't care. I didn't bother going for a second drink at the risk of wasting another 12 dollars on overpriced fruit juice."}
{"text":"A comedy of errors. 

Beautiful decor and otherwise good service was ruined by 1) overlooked dishes 2) undercooked dishes 3) getting something completely different than we ordered (peppercorn steak is not the same as steak with bearnaise sauce) 4) 3 of the house wines being unavailable 5) still being charged $200 for a terrible meal and 6) having to wait 15 minutes to pay because none of the credit card terminals would work. Eventually, we just left. 

Truth be told, this restaurant has potential and the staff mean well. Problem is that on the night we visited, they couldn't get their act together and committed the cardinal sin in restaurant management: charging their guests an exorbitant amount for what was  a complete waste of money. 

We also noticed another table sending food back that same night so there is clearly an issue at this restaurant. 

Toronto is full of places that will gladly take your hard earned money. I'd recommend steering clear of this place until they get their act together or until it changes ownership again."}
{"text":"What a fun event!!!
Friendly bar staff, bottomless tequila and vodka cocktails and delicious risotto Parmesan cheese balls delish!
The 18tj century converted home has an exquisite view from the floor to ceiling windows in the bar. Heritage wood floors and mouldings create the old Toronto charm indicative of this neighbourhood. The Keg Mansion sits nestled across the street. 
Thank you so much for inviting us to such a fun event!!"}
{"text":"The spot is pretty nice, a converted house, but the high ceilings, large rooms and lack of any background music make a private conversation a virtual impossibility.  Patio looks like a decent spot for a few cocktails, but was a little too chilly at the time of our visit. Food was very average. The wood boards (meats & cheeses) were pretty tasty, but the apps and mains were a mess. The beef carpaccio was soaking wet, having clearly just been defrosted (an all too common occurrence in this city), and the gnocchi and pappardelle were not good - not terrible mind you - just not good. High points? The pizza (Bosco) was pretty tasty. I'd definitely give this place a 2nd visit for a pizza and some cocktails on the patio. The service was also quite good, very attentive and on top of the situation."}
{"text":"I went to Osteria Dei Ganzi for the first time yesterday evening for dinner.  I was attending the birthday of my sister in law.

I had read reviews prior but I try to not let too much of what I read influence me considering I was going to this place anyway and experiences are different for each person so I was going to go in with an open mind and give this place the benefit of the doubt because lots of what is written on Yelp I know that some criticisms can be constructive and things can change with enough feedback.  

This place is basically an old house and a very impressive property that also has outdoor seating which nobody was using (I couldn't figure out why) with some nice furniture.  It was a cool but humid evening.

The place is nicely decorated with large canvas type hanging of Sophia Loren and other things that look Italian.  Directly above my head was a chandelier that gave the room a very sophisticated feel.

Anyway the first thing I noticed walking into the dining area was that the air was stagnant, stifling and very uncomfortable.  The inside reminded me of being a kid in our old house with no AC.  Apparently they have AC but it doesn't help as I was looking up at the ceilings, walls etc and I couldn't find a vent to save my life.  The structure is old, I get it but it honestly felt as if there was no air circulation at all. NONE.  

My brother in law had asked if they could do something with the AC and our server said they would turn it up.  Whether they actually did or not I can honestly say it made no difference whatsoever.  So here we are about 16 people or so baking in this room watching every body else bake as well.  I couldn't believe something as simple as the comfort of the room would get to me so much.  It goes to show how much I take it for granted that where I go that the AC or heating is appropriate for the guests and that it be comfortable to to enjoy yourself indoors.  

I as well as others at my table had to at times literally get up from the table and go outside just to get fresh air and catch a bit of a breeze.  I found this dining area to be the absolute worst climate controlled (none) areas I've ever been in.  It was the most uncomfortable dining area I've ever been in, period.

DINING AREA COMFORT = F- please contact an HVAC consultant as this is serious

 The menus were already all on the table so I had a chance to look it over for quite a while before we were asked if we wanted drinks.  Mind you we arrived and seated our selves at 6:30pm.  We didn't order drinks till maybe closer to 7pm when the guest of honor arrived who I sat directly across from so I know we didn't order drinks until well after they arrived.  

The birthday girl after ordering the drinks ordered 3 planks of the Misto appetizers for all the guests.  While this order was placed, the rest of us didn't really get a chance to place an order for apps and the rest of the party wasn't there but about half of us were already.  Almost everybody arrived closer to around 7:15pm.  I don't think it would have really mattered what time everybody came because our server didn't really stay on top of our table.  Any apps ordered were all brought out at the same time as the mains except the Misto planks.

It was evident that staff for this establishment is short...  I was never asked if I wanted another drink nor was anybody else asked that I know of.  Food was brought out and the waitress asked once if everything was ok.  That was perhaps the last we saw of her until it was time to collect plates and ask about coffee etc

Let's just say we arrived at 6:30pm and didn't leave until 9:30pm in this furnace of a room.  Because we are a group, an AUTOMATIC 18% gratuity was added to our bills.  In this particular case I felt robbed.  It made me feel like we didn't warrant attention because the tip was going to be added anyway.

SERVICE = D (slow, unfriendly, unaccommodating) our server did not look happy to serve 

I had ordered their version of steak tartar as my app that arrived with my pizza (main).  Nothing says bad timing like your app coming at the same time as your main.  We had the Misto planks which were the best part of the food that night probably because most of it is already prepared (meats, cheeses, etc).  The steak tartar was sort of bland.  The crostini that came on the side... some were soggy and not crunchy!  I had ordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  The crust was not good as I found it hard and dry.  I guess I am spoiled and used to wood stove cooked crust that is chewy.  The tiramisu they brought out while I didn't partake, I was told by my wife that it was not made with mascarpone. I know my Italian food, my wife is Italian.

FOOD QUALITY = F+ (plus is for the cheese and meat they didn't make.

This is without a doubt the worst experience I've had dining out ever.  The quality of the environment, service and food to me were all failures.  Receiving the bill felt like an insult with 18% on top of it."}
{"text":"Formerly known as the home of Grand Hive Restaurant, the successor restaurant to this address is a pleasant dining escape from the mundane quick-service restaurants that line up Yonge Street.  I decided to try this place on a Friday evening when a friend of mine visiting from out of town was looking for a place to eat.  We first tried the Keg Mansion across the street but due to a water leak, that restaurant was closed. So we crossed the street to try this restaurant and we were greeted by a warm and attentive staff member who presented us with menus and was able to seat us soon afterwards.

Excellent selection of Italian selections including personal pizzas, fettuccine, and raviolini, this place delivered when it came to taste, cost, and presentation. Located in one of the stately manor homes on Jarvis Street, the place was packed (I guess due to the Keg Mansion being closed), but everything happens for a reason, and I'm glad I tried this place.


To the staff at Osteria, thank you for making us feel right at home. I'll definitely be back! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I came here for 'licious dinner last Friday and was less than impressed with the food and the service. To me, it was pretty clear that Osteria is a new restaurant and they are still trying to get their footing as there were many lags during the meal and the servers were mixed up with which table ordered what. 
Both my friend and I got the scallops to start which were soggy. The sauce was good though, very buttery. I think the server gave us someone else's order as it came out really quickly and then shortly after we finished it the same server came to give us another serving of them! 

I got the steak medium rare - it was more medium as it was very thin (you get what you pay for, right). The veggies it came with were good though... you can tell they were a bit caramelized. My friend got the penne. Her penne was nothing special and the pasta was underdone and a bit hard to chew. I really could have made better penne at home. 

Lastly, our dessert took over half an hour to get to us. We had to ask after we noticed it was nearly 20 mins and the sun had already set - it got pretty cold. We did get an apology from the server but no realty explanation as to why it was late besides \"I put it in the system but it somehow got missed\". 

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here as there are better restaurants in the area, although admittedly, the pizza did look very good (I was peeking at other tables lol). The patio was a little awkward as it was on an obvious slant so I was sitting lower than my friend and there was lots of movement of different tables around me to accommodate changing party sizes."}
{"text":"I have been to Osteria a few times, but surprisingly never for a full dinner, only passed hors d'oeuvres and drinks.

The first time was for the soft opening, and I had a great time. The second was for a party for the National Post. Last night, it was for a Yelp event.

My favourite items I have tasted are the deep fried olives (OMG), mini pizzas, and rice balls (arancini). The drinks are well made and they have pretty much anything your heart could desire.

The mansion itself is absolutely gorgeous, you really should come and check it out. I have it on good authority that it may even be haunted.... BOO!

I am looking forward to finally coming for a sit down dinner in the near future and shall update my review then. But until then, \"YAY! I'm a fan\"!"}
{"text":"Add this to the long list of disappointing restaurants in the Church-Wellesley area. 

A caprese salad made with underripe supermarket tomatoes basically serves as a metaphor for the whole experience. It's the height of the season for beautiful, local tomatoes, and the whole point of a caprese salad is to highlight their flavor. But the cooks at Osteria apparently do not care, and the server seemed confused when I tried to explain my disappointment. 

I followed the salad with a spaghetti amatriciana. The pasta was nice and perfectly cooked, but it was drowned in an excess of sauce that tasted like a doctored can of Hunt's. 

Not to my taste, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Venue: Osteria dei Ganzi
Specialty: Italian
Menu items: Drinks - Mulata and 90 Miles to Cuba, Misto Wood Board, Arancini, Melanzane alla Parmigiana, Osso Bucco, Parpadelle and Tiramisu


It was mid August when it all happened. We were invited by Urban Spoon for a night of feasting, celebration and just good eating, and Osteria dei Ganzi was just the place for that. Located in downtown East Toronto, the historic mansion built in 1891 by famed architect George Horace Gooderham is the home of Osteria dei Ganzi, a place where local Ontario produce, imported Italian products and a \"Dolce Vita\" atmosphere reside. The place is mansion-big, has a solarium-style bar, a patio that seats 200 people and a decor that reminds you of a 1930?s Italian movie yet it's lamps and wall posts brings you back to the future.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed by some of the most fantastic cocktails these lips have tasted. Made by a mixologist's hand, the Mulata (left) - a delicious mix of tequila plata, amaro averna, maple cigar syrup, pure espresso and xocoltal bitter, was sweet at first followed by a strong smooth bitter taste. The 90 miles to Cuba (right) - a rum, freshed pressed lime juice, maraschino and sugar mixed drink, contained all the right acid notes mixed with the crunchy sweet feel of the sugar.

To kick-off what was about to be one of the most exquisite nights of the summer, the chef sent us a Misto Wood Board containing Italian cold cuts and cheeses, mixed with berries, apples and bread sticks. Our favourite from the night was the Buffalo meat cold cut, with a strong taste that mixed with the fruits gave it a whole new dimension on bite.

Shortly after we finished the delectable charcuterie platter, we were greeted by a white bowl of Arancini. Except this Arancini (aka deep fried Italian rice balls) was also accompanied by lightly deep fried olives, once again adding more dimension to the taste of the dish and making us beg for more of that toasty and crunchy Arancini batter that melted in our palates.

As the night continued to fall so did our appetizer feast, at our table landed some exquisite Melanzane alla Parmigiana, basically a crispy breaded eggplant topped with fresh tomato sauce, basil and buffalo mozzarella cheese. The eggplant was perfectly cooked, meaning the veggie's texture was well preserved, while the crunch from the breading kept it all together.

Upon nightfall, we finally started with the mains. First came the Osso Bucco, a Milanese specialty of cross-cut veal shanks (bone marrow) braised with vegetables and black peppercorn gremolata, a chopped herb condiment typically made of lemon zest, garlic and parsley. The meat melted on bite with no chance for a knife to even come to the party. Though I would question the choice for plaiting, a large bowl, we did enjoy every bite of this dish.

The night's favourite however was the Pappardelle, a pasta with long, thin egg noddles with lobster, zucchini, mushrooms, roasted garlic, extra virgin olive oil and a splash of dry vermouth, sprinkled with parsley. A great combination that only at Ganzi you can find.

For dessert, we asked the pastry Chef to come out so we could congratulate her. Made on the premises and on the same day, we were astound by the taste, flavour and just well prepared piece of Tiramisu in a Jar. With lady fingers, berries and amaretto, this dessert was the table's favourite and one to remember for years to come.

A special thanks to Urban Spoon for hosting this unique Toronto event and to Osteria dei Ganzi for treating a table of food aficionados like royalty and feeding us such succulent dishes.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times.and have had good experiences every time.  

My favourites are the asparagus pizza, the caprese salad, the home-made ravioli, rice balls and the DELICIOUS sangria.  

I've had both good and bad experiences there with service, especially at the bar.

I hope they get better ventilation inside or some additional air conditioners b/c it gets really hot in there.  

The patio is huge, and great for people watching in the summer.  The inside of the mansion is beautiful and is decorated really nice.  I would love to see what they have upstairs - though I don't think it's open to the public.  

I'm so glad that this place opened instead of that bee hive restaurant or whatever it was that was always empty.  It's great that Osteria has brought life back into this beautiful historical building.  

They do paint nite here sometimes which is always fun too!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place 3 times. So it's not without real effort and money.

To me, the best part of this place and it seems I'm not. alone here is the bar. I have to admit the bar itself would get 5 stars. They do know their stuff.

This review is for the food.
This time round I had spaghetti with meatballs. Immediately upon that first bite it tasted familiar - chef boyardee spaghetti and meatballs in a can. Upscale with shavings of gran Padano.

Customer service was spot on. They were patient with our table. That I truly thank them for."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food was always amazing. Definitely the best homemade gnocchi in Toronto. The pizza crust is so tasty and their tiramisu is to die for. Definitely an A++"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say this is just a review for the bar...I have not had dinner here yet.  i got a tip from another bartender in the city who was doing great stuff that this was a solid location for good drinks.

First off, Osteria Dei Ganzi is in a beautiful old mansion with a great AMBIANCE.  The bar decor is really well done with large Edison bulbs in globe fixtures, although the TV's definitely detract from the space.  Dear bar-owners...unless you're a sports bar, please do not put in a TV.

The COCKTAILS though were the star.  The Portuguese bartender João both knows his libations and has a passion.  I ordered an off-menu classic cocktail, a Vieux Carre, with no need for explanation.  In fact when chatting he could give a detailed justification for choosing one vermouth over another....this is lightyears beyond your typical Toronto bar.

João was also quite creative and could be trusted to mix you a surprise drink.  A chamomile-scented scented Sazerac caught me off-guard as a beguiling drink that I would have predicted would be awful.  Another beautiful drink had banana-infused Jameson as a base with some smoky Laphroiag to cut the sweetness.  

OVERALL, we enjoyed the cocktails very much.  We didn't try the food...perhaps some of the one-star reviews scared me.  We had kind of an awkward view back onto the kitchen from our seat, which without going into detail hasn't motivated me to try the food either.  The bar, though, is absolutely on top of their game with excellent cocktails from a serious mixologist."}
{"text":"So interesting spot and great food.
The thing that strikes you right off is the amazing building.
It's a heritage site -- was owned by Gooderham and built around 1868.  Much of the inside has been kept intact (floors, woodwork, ceilings), but they have done a great job reno'ing it to add the modern touch.

3 of us came here and had dinner.
Can highly recommend the:
- Caesar salad
- Spaghetti Polpette
- Linguine Stromboli
- the cannoli's

Food was fresh and hot --- they use local sourced goods too!
Generous offerings - some things shareable -- like the salad before the meal.
Wonderful flavors -- the meatballs were perfect!

We also had some drinks at the bar and they had some very interesting offerings including the usual.

Great choices on the wine list (Italian of course).  Recommend the Chianti Fiore.

Staff were great -- friendly and knowledgeable.  Prices were very reasonable.

One small down-side - very small bathrooms -- only 2 stalls in the ladies.  But that was manageable.

Check it out -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the service is a bit slow. I had the trout special and my husband had the chicken scaloppine. The Pinot Grigio is also excellent!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and location! Tasty food! Awesome custom drinks and very friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lovables are the atmosphere and servers.
Set in what looks like an ancient mansion, walls covered with art and dim light, makes the place ideal for casual date. 
The servers were very friendly.
5 mins walk to Wellesley subway.
The noodle pasta is made in house, and is al dente, which was not our favourite, but we didn't realize it was aldente.
Tilapia dipped in tomato sauce, was pretty yummy.
It's a good place to try, although I wish the waitress' knew more about the dishes."}
{"text":"Went here for group brunch after a baptism. My eggs Benedict was very good, and the fresh strawberry donuts were phenomenal. If I was rating this restaurant on those dishes alone, I would give this restaurant a four out of five, maybe even a five. However, there were WAY to few workers for the number of guests. Food took over 90 minutes to arrive, and came at wildly different times. I finished my meal and started writing this yelp review, before the person sitting across from me even got her dish. My wife's bacon and fried eggs were overlooked. Butter at table was frozen.

Back to the good...the decor was stunning; the restaurant is in a beautiful historic building with grande wood mouldings. The white marble tables are well matched.

I feel this restaurant has untapped potential, and I will make a point to come back in a year's time."}
{"text":"I went here last night for my birthday dinner with 15 friends. All separate bills, all separate menus-- most restaurants do not do well with this kind of challenge. Osteria Dei Ganzi, however, delivered quite nicely. 
Had reservations for 8:45
Was offered to meet my party in the bar area until everyone arrived 
Everyone came and was seated by 9:15 
Waiters were attentive, accommodating of my food intolerances, and very likeable. All of our service was impeccable and friendly. 
We mainly ate off the Winterlicious menu, and everyone seemed to really enjoy their meal. I heard no complaints
I downed almost a whole bottle of wine, which maybe added to how nice I thought everything was haha
The environment is chic and casual but still dressy and fun  
The service gets top top marks 
Everything went off well organized, timely, and with no issues in bills or anything 

Will definitely go back.  Thanks for a great 21st birthday."}
{"text":"Shia Labeouf live-tweeted his acid trip in 2012 and wrote, \"yr gonna see me in yr dream cause i dont know where to live anymore.\" Living inside Ganzi would be a dream. It feels like one. Every time I rubber neck the close-enough to Chuck Close-styled Sophia Loren painting, the perfect leather Danish chairs, the marble table-tops, the Vespa hanging on the wall, their logo, their font choice on their menu, their presentation of a Negroni in a tiny former Chinotto soda bottle with a crystal rocks glass, the bolognese or the ragout, the smiles of the service, the over-sized brick patio under the dappled neon of the Keg Mansion sign, the turret of the home, the fact that it is a giant home converted into this side bar, and drawing room-turned-Italian eatery, I feel like they managed to check everything off the list of what I want. And every time I rubber neck myself in their downstairs bathroom mirror to ask: move closer to this establishment. Until then, it's cross town cabs for me because a night of Sophia Loren art over my shoulder in front of my wife's lovely smile and between our elbows on marble tables is Italian (new) comfort food is precisely what I dream to have in my life, like more Shia."}
{"text":"YUM again!!! Been a few times and never had a bad experience.  Recently went there for my birthday.  Surprise from a friend of mine since he knew how much I LOVE OSSO BUCCO there.  They went out of their way to get Osso Bucco for me even though it wasn't on the menu anymore as they change the menu every few months to showcase their food.  Let me just say, service was excellent as always.  Water always topped up, wine glass always filled as well.  Plates removed, new napkins, new cutlery with each course.  Just phenomenal service!!! Food, equals perfection.  

We had appetizers, first course, second course and dessert.  All exceptional!!! I highly recommend the Melanzane Alla Parmigiana as an appetizer.  The Penne All' Arrabiata was perfect.  Lots of sauce and we asked for hot sauce as well to add more spice and even the home made hot sauce was divine.  I don't eat bread!!! BUT THAT DAY, I had bread to dip into the yummy sauce and hot sauce.  Then the Osso Bucco came...WOW!!! Sliding off the bone.  Bone Marrow YUM.  Grilled veggies - Fresh and delicious! 

Dessert - OFF THE CHARTS!!!  I want to add a pic but have no idea how to lol TRUST ME when I say, the cheesecake melts in your mouth!!! MELTS!  

Been there with friends and with a date and both work.  Its a perfect place for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food was excellent and couldn't ask for better service. The bar is really fun too- really good cocktails. Highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Ganzi Osteria this summer for an event. As many have pointed out, the home/restaurant is gorgeous. I had the opportunity to sample an array of dishes, but I was not a big fan of the donut, but only because I do not like marmalade. In fact, almost everyone at the event loved the donuts so don't take my word for it. Besides the donuts, I can't think of a dish I did not enjoy. 

In the middle of the event I did something to my camera and could not figure out how to fix it. A staff member noticed my distress and she and several others came over to help me. Not only was the staff professional, but they went out of their way to make my night a great one. Now that I know about this restaurant, I will certainly be returning. 

Yes, I have noticed that many reviewers have had some issues with this restaurant. This restaurant is pretty new and it is my feeling that they are working hard on smoothing out the kinks. That said, I can see why many diners would be apprehensive about dining here. If you are not sure about ordering a whole meal here, then at least check-out their bar. It's pretty awesome!

**This review is about the food I had during the event I attended. I cannot speak for their day-to-day dishes. I do hope that the food we had at the event (quality of ingredients, taste and look) is what they are serving on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, simple tasty Italian food made with the freshest ingredients. Loved the service. Seriously awesome bartender recently imported from Portugal. Love Ganzi!! Can't wait for hot summer to hit their patio."}
{"text":"An awesome 3-in-1 experience. An over 140 years old villa which is beautifully restored, with nice and helpful waiters enjoying an awesome meal. Coming from Germany and living in NYC that's a hidden gem here in Downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"I'm honestly shocked at how divided people are about Ganzi. I wonder if it was a case of them getting a slow start when they initially opened two years ago? A couple of really busy nights in a hot summer that through them off? If so, go back Torontonians! You won't be disappointed! 

I've had some of the most beautiful pizza here and their osso bucco is fall-off-the-bone, juicy goodness. They also do these donut-like dessert things that I had at a Yelp event, and I've got to say: those things are legit. Probably not good for the hips, but people went nuts for them. Beyond their eats, their liquid treats are hot hot hot, too. 

It's true, I have worked with them a few times so I'm a little bit biased, but they are that clutch restaurant that will do last minute catering when you need help, and not only will they show up, but their chef will serenade you with Italian arias when they do. I've worked with them on multiple occasions, and dined here independently one other time, and I can say without any doubt: I heart this five star business. 

The chef and management do pop ups on the regular, and are just always up to try something new and show off their goods. Today they housed an In N Out Burger pop up for TIFF. Let's get real, that's the coolest thing that happened in Toronto today, and though I didn't line up for an animal style cheeseburger, I have a great appreciation for all that these guys do."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night with my friend for Winterlicious. It was also my first winterlicious! I picked Osteria Dei Ganzi because I'm a big fan of Italian food and the menu seemed accommodating to my pickiness :P

I ordered:

Appetizer: cream of mushroom soup
Main: Fettuccine alftredo with tiger shrimp
Dessert: Tiramisu 

The mushroom soup was delicious! It wasn't overly hot but I almost prefer that because when I'm hungry I hate waiting for food to cool down. It had big pieces of mushroom in it which I really enjoyed.

The pasta was also amazing. I'm not a big pasta person but the sauce wasn't too creamy which I was happy about and they gave a generous amount of shrimp. I felt great after eating, a little sleepy but not overly full which I was worried about with a 3 course meal. 

Then came the tiramisu. I haven't tried tiramisu too many times but I found theirs very good and a great way to end a great meal.

Our waiter was very friendly and spaced out each course perfectly. My friend and I were chatting and catching up for a while after the meal and he knew exactly when to come in with the bill. 

Overall it was a nice experience. The restaurant itself was beautiful. It is located inside an 120 year old mansion and our table was in the perfect spot inside this little alcove off to the side. It was quite romantic. When I make a reservation I expect the table to be in a good spot, and this definitely exceeded my expectation.

WARNING: street signs outside the place aren't marked very well and my friend got a parking ticket."}
