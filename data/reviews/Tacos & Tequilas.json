{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the green chile pork tacos, get them everytime! The salsa is always just the right spice, and the beans have a phenomenal flavor, kind of a hidden gem off cave creek. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a quick post work drink and hopefully coming across some gluten free food.  

Come to find out, the bartender makes her own tasty margarita mix and the chef knows what it's like to live with someone with Celiac Disease.  He prepped the grill and steered me away from anything that's so much as seasoned with gluten, even double checked seasoning ingredients!!!   Boom!!!!

This place is a Celiac's gift!!!   Great for non-Celiac's, too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Food is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the service we received from Sam and Kelton was personable and flawless! Came in on a Friday night for karaoke and Dex rocked the house! Would recommend this to anyone looking for a new place to try in North Phoenix. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Worst \"Mexican\" food I've ever had.. the service.. so lacking that it was non existence. Took forever to get drinks and chips. And there was un-bussed tables that had dirty plates and drinks on it for the whole time we where there. There was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar. Meal and drinks got comp'd but still. Over all, anywhere else is better than there. When they checked into the table, 3 out of 4 orders where wrong and it took awhile to fix that (even tho they were written down ) 


Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican restaurant,  the food is great and you can't beat the prices. The bartender is always up to make fun cocktails and the staff is very personable and prompt."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Guest from another table actually served us.

Super understaffed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in today for a beer and a quesadilla the tortilla was cooked great to the crisp and the cheese was melted well inside the homemade sour cream was  awesomely creamy. Randy our server was amazing! Talkative and was on top of things. Totally come in here for great food and an awesome server."}
{"text":"Reviews must be friends/family. Sat down (not seated) waited 5min or so to be greated. Server approaches and takes drink order. Returns a few minutes later and asks if we want menus. So, at this point we have now been seated for 8-10 min and have yet to see a menu. No big, can move on. Get menus (printed on xerox paper and stapled together) and begin to order food. Server informs they are out of Carne asada. No big, can move on. So I ask about the shredded beef and chicken. Server response, they are plain.... Really, plain? Ok, move on. Order tacos. They literally take at least 30 min. It's not busy by the way. Oh, and the entire time theres karaoke... like we are supposed to have a taco in one hand and a microphone in the other.. so, listen to terrible/terribly loud music while waiting for food. Tacos come, aaaand they are not even average. Why did it take 30 min for tacos with basically cold meat and cold tortillas? Just don't get it. Anyway, check comes. For what we got, def over priced. Grabbing a 6 pack and taco bell before coming back."}
{"text":"I live very close to this place and both my wife and I have eaten there MANY times.

My wife and I go there pretty regularly on Tues,Wed, or Thur - For the specials, which are GREAT.

3 street tacos with drunken chicken - EXCELLENT
Pork Burro with red AND green sauce - EXCELLENT
Chips & Salsa - ALSO EXCELLENT.

From what I've been told, the recipes come from the cook who is Mexican and WE love her stuff.

- 1 star:  We no longer get desserts there.  Consistency of the \"Mexican Fried Ice Cream\"  leave you feeling a bit betrayed.   Whipped cream isn't whipped cream,  It is some commercial topping and it rather sucks.  Corn flake coating is rubbery.  All in all a disappointment.  WAS good a while back, now, not so much.  :-(

BUT THE MEXICAN FOOD,  OH SO GOOD.  :-)   The People, Great too!

DO BE AWARE:  THE SPECIALS ARE IN-HOUSE ONLY, NOT TAKE-OUT."}
{"text":"So I haven't had the time to go into this new bar/ Mexican food joint! But My long term friend told me about the place, he currently is new chef and believe me when I tell you, this place well start booming in just a few weeks with him there, he's a young chubby guy Full of ideas and tasty Food knowledge, he's the reason why my place was a success, I had way to much things on my menu and my food expenses were threw the roof, I brought him in and he shorten my menu with foods that would sale, and foods that will help me sale more drinks at my bar, his food presentation are straight beautiful he gave my customers the idea that they were in a upscale restaurant not in a small family owned! ( his belief is you eat from your eyes aswel as your mouth, so the food has to look tasty) Try this place out guys you will not be disappointed! And if you have already gave up on this place give it one more shot, ask for chef Carlos aka Chef Charlie R! If your last visit wasn't all that great let him know and believe be he will do everything In his power to make this visit worth it! Tell him Johnny sent you."}
{"text":"Great little spot with friendly staff and chill vibe! Go. Here. Nothing better than supporting your local spots. Solid salsa, tasty margs and tacos are bomb-diggity! Ask for Rebecca or Renee"}
{"text":"I liked the service super friendly! And best of all they not only do Taco Tuesday but they also do Taco Thrusday specials! My favorite were the shredded beef and chicken. The asada was ok and so was the drunken chicken. I have not tried the chili pork. They also have ladies night with wine specials to do wine Wednesdays that include margarita specials because since they're closed on Mondays they can't do margarita Mondays lol. The music was great the times I've gone they have classic rock and the ambiance us super chill. They offer Free chips and salsa with water as soon as you seat down. Great clean place I've been there twice so far and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved to the area a few months ago and we were mourning the loss of our favorite taco place in Scottsdale when we remembered Tacos and Tequila. Upon arriving we were promptly greeted by the staff and they immediately brought us chips and salsa. The chips had a nice seasoning on them that made it feel unique to the restaurant. Both salsas (red and green) were favorable but not overly spicy.  We got the house margaritas, which were pretty good. It didn't taste too sweet like most house margaritas are. Since it was Taco Tuesday we ordered the street tacos. I got the taco with the drunken chicken (tequila and lime flavoring) and it was DELICIOUS. The chicken wasn't dry and it was very flavorful. The boyfriend tried the Shredded Beef, Green Chili Pork, and the Carne Asada. All three were delicious but the Green Chili Pork was his favorite.  It had a lot of flavor and it wasn't chewy or dry. The taco Tuesday special didn't come with beans and rice but we added it to our plate and I'm glad that we did. The beans were good and the rice tasted like authentic Mexican rice. Full of flavor and not drying. I normally have to mix my rice and beans together because I find that the rice is usually bland at various restaurants, although at Taco and Tequila I ate my rice as is and enjoyed every minute of it. After consuming copious amounts of food we moved onto the Pina Coladas and they were delicious. The owner made it and delivered it with a rum floater. It was absolutely delicious. It reminded me of Rocky Point, Mexico and was a perfect ending to a delightful visit. While we were  in Pina Colada heaven the owner came over and talked to us about making the Pina Colado and shared some tips for an at home recipe. The entire staff was attentive and polite. There was absolutely nothing for us to complain about or anything about that visit that we disliked. We are looking forward to coming back and trying other options on the menu. If it was anything like last night's experience I am sure it will be amazing."}
{"text":"This place unfortunately was awful.....poor service, food is not mexican food at all, tastes like it was microwaved cheap bought stuff.....Def needs some help with ownership and or management.....I hope they can pull it together, would be nice to have an actual mexican food place in the area...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have loved everything I've tried so far...especially the pomegranate margarita  The service is outstanding and the food is delicious! This is a great hidden treasure of North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excited for this New Mexican neighborhood bar and restaurant!   I really hope people discover them. It's a great thing for the area.  Fast and personal service!! Great food and salsa."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place with a friendlier staff! Everyone was attentive, kind and happy! They brought games to our table while we waited for our food...I mean, how cool?!? My kids played connect four while my wife and I played jenga. The salsa is ridiculously good. The food was on point!  A must eat! The GM, Renee, was extremely kind and her team is behind her 100%, so please go pay them a visit and try the Avocado Salsa. Enjoy."}
{"text":"GREAT food and atmosphere!  Loved this place and can't wait to come back.  Not your chain mass market Mexican food restaurant thank God. Amazing service from Emerald and the best skinny margarita I ever had.  Simple, clean and fresh AND incredible quality for the price we paid."}
{"text":"We stop in Friday for happy hour.  The sandwich board says 4-8pm!

As we enter we realize it's just us and 3 dudes at the bar.  We get menus from our female bartender and ask what type of margaritas they have.  \"Besides house?\" One of the guys pipes up saying they have strawberry, and maybe enough for watermelon.  Ok... House it is!

The music is loud nicki minaj which my mom does not care for so one of the 3 dudes nicely changes it to maroon 5 for my mom.

She pours our drinks generously, served in chilled glasses and they look delicious.  Once I get a taste... Um no!

My mom and I pay right away, since we both know 1 is enough!  As we are getting ready to leave one of the guys asks if we liked our drinks.  I was honest and said No right away.  My mom says \"we like fresh lime\" to which he replies \"it has fresh lime, lemon, and orange juices alone with triple sec and sweet & sour.\"  There's your problem buddy.  He said I can check Yelp because a lot of people like the margaritas!! Haha that will surely convince me... Not.

He then complains about how busy it gets on Fridays and how it's hard to bring chips & salsa, take orders, and run food to the patrons.  We just smile and leave."}
{"text":"Just average tasting  food. Nice service but nothing that makes me want to go back. Their salsa has a nice flavor but their fajitas aren't served with anything to jazz them up at all. Enchiladas were mediocre tasting. Nothing exceptional about that enchilada sauce. Many other Mexican restaurants I would visit prior to this one. Bathrooms were dirty."}
{"text":"A fantastic little gem for AMAZING food. Great owner behind the bar. I highly recommend! Thanks Dan for a fun unexpected lunch at your place. We will definitely stop in again if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I really want to rate it 3.5. It wasn't bad, the service was great. I think it just left more to be desired. We were seated and right away they brought chips with green and red salsa. Both had good flavor, green seemed hotter. We tried three of each of the following tacos asada, drunken chicken, and green chili pork. All of them came with a lot of white onion on top which I wanted to take off but feel like the tacos would have been really lacking flavor. I mean three for $5 is a decent deal but they just weren't overly stellar and I'd rather go to a more authentic place to get tacos."}
{"text":"Wanted a margarita on National Margarita Day and happened to be by here. Stopped in for dinner & a margarita. I had the street tacos with carne asada & husband had the Monster burrito. Both were good! My house margarita was delish & hit the spot. The guacamole & chips were good. For dessert we had the dessert nachos & those were so yummy!!! My only grip is that the owner (pretty sure he was the owner) was sitting at a table with 2 women & he kept dropping the f-bomb, very loud. Now I'm no angel & yes I swear but really...not so loud! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Chips and salsa for starters, chips have extra spice on them.  2 for 3$ tacos were delicious, lots of choices for meats. Bartender Kelton seated us and served us right away, super friendly the whole time. House margarita is great, only tried it blended but great taste.  We'll be going back soon and taking all our friends with us."}
{"text":"You gotta try, you won't want to go anywhere else. If you want great service, tacos or burritos that are monstrous, and a great happy hour come here! I like it because it's family centric yet Happy hour ALL weekend! See Tess or Ed and you won't regret it. 

Stop in and let me know what you think"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their street tacos, probably my favorite in all of Phoenix. I would give them 5 stars but, no matter how I order (online, over the phone, or in person) they don't understand \"pico on the side, no cilantro\".  Every single time they serve it with pico all over plus an extra side of it, and most of the time with the full extra helping of cilantro I asked to not have. I then have to pick it apart to try and remove as much of it as possible."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that the bartender was very nice. He tried to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. 
However, the food wasn't very good. We had fajita quesadilla and enchiladas. Both were extremely bland. We decided to try it based on the Yelp reviews but it was a mistake. I am honestly not sure how this place has remained open for over a year because we were the only people inside until the end. It was clean looking though."}
{"text":"Great little place!  Corey was fantastic  and the food is great.  They have karaoke Fridays and Saturdays and we will be bringing friends here for some  fun times with good food, drinks and music!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing drinks are so good and strong . They have a really good customer service"}
{"text":"Wish the new owner didn't jack up the beer prices and get rid of some of the food choices...probably won't go back for awhile. Wasn't highly impressed with the switch. Missing the flavor it used to have."}
{"text":"Owner here took great care of my wife and I. Great specials and fast service on to go orders. Based on the great service alone I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food (2 miserable tacos, no side dish, gastly salsa) got the address through a coupon deal...pretty bad"}
{"text":"Love this joint! Staff and owners rock and everyone is super friendly! I love when I can go get some yummy Mexican food full of flavor, that's fresh and spicy!!! Will be back for sure! Stop by and try :)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and even though the food was good, I would give it no stars if I could!

Went in with 6 people at the bar (one of which was the owner I later found out) on a Tuesday which is normally Taco Tuesday crazy busy!  But not here.  I sit at bar, look at the menu and ask bartender it's my first time here what is good?  He says everything!  Didn't want to be rude but wanted to say if everything was great there would be more than 6 people here at 5:45 on a Tuesday at a Taco (Mexican) place!  So he tells me the special is 3 Street Tacos for $5 and can add pico and cheese for $1 more.  I said let's do that.  What kind of meat are my choices I ask as sometimes specials don't include all the options.  Then the OWNER who is sitting at the bar getting drunk off his beer interrupts and says look at the menu that's where the meats are.  I was like, EXCUSE ME? Sorry to ask an employee what my choices are?  Then I order the carne asada and the OWNER interrupts AGAIN and says I have to try the DRUNKEN Chicken!  I wanted to say why because you are drunk and you like chicken?  I was appalled that I can't order what I WANT!  I kindly looked over and said I will stick with my choice!

I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN and unless you want someone telling you read the menu and what to order, you shouldn't go here either.

NOTE TO OWNER - if you are going to drink at your bar, don't talk to customers! You come off as a rude and a word I can't put on Yelp! 

It's sad too because it looked like a family run business as you could see the wife working, and might have been daughter there as well.  Maybe they should watch some Bar Rescue shows as they probably can't figure out why they aren't busier as the Tacos were good.  Here's a hint, look at the OWNER getting drunk at the bar!"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today and I have to say it was the worst food. The lobster burrito tasted like it came from the dumpster. It was awful, it smelled like it has been rotting. The burrito was left in tact and when I told the waitress she said oh sorry. Work on your customer service we paid for the burrito and gave a tip. Never did she offer a new burrito or take it off the bill. We will never eat here or recommend this resturant to anyone."}
{"text":"Not the Ritz-Carlton but if you are maybe looking for really good, really inexpensive street tacos or other Mexican tastes, this place has it and you can save a bundle. Happy hour starts a 3 pm and you can use your Groupon. More taste, less money! Speaking of, they have that elusive Michelob Ultra on tap! Did you like that segue I used? Back to the cerveza. They have an admirable selection behind the bar. As I implied, it is very casual, which is nice as you can go, eat drink, make a fool of yourself and fit right in. Seriously, good food, good price, good helpful service and good location close to SR 101. Easy to get to. Give it a try, you'll go again."}
{"text":"What a great taco spot!! Super comfy spot with a fun ambience, friendly staff, well stocked bar, and amazing food! We had margaritas, rolled tacos as an appetizer, chicken fajitas, and a couple of street tacos.  The rolled tacos were fabulous and had just the right amount of meat and crisp tortilla.  The fajitas were plentiful with meat and veggies and tasted very fresh.  I got the carne asada and drunken chicken street tacos 'supreme style' (which included tomatoes and onions).  Both tasted amazing and I'd order them again.  Service was fast and friendly. We both agreed we would come here again soon!"}
{"text":"Ok...I really REALLY want to like this place.  It's right by my house, I love tacos and Mexican food in general, and I love tequila more than I should.  But here's the deal folks - it's not good.  The tequila selection is limited to like 10 brands that aren't great, and there is no list of what they have.  And the food is really sub-par too.  I hate to say it because I really want to support the local folks and local restaurants but after three tries with this place, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This turned out to be an expected and delicious surprise!  After a day of thrifting in 115+ degree heat, we were in need of sustenance and margaritas.  The gentlemen who seated us and waited on us was delightful and was kind of enough to bring me a little cup of sliced jalapenos for my margaritas - TWICE! 

The chips, salsa and bean dip are so good that you could literally just stop there.  You shouldn't.  But you could.  

My enchiladas were fantastic and everything tasted homemade.  Our server confirmed that the chef makes all of her own everything.  That was evident and I ate until I nearly burst.  

The location isn't sexy at all (little strip mall in North Phoenix) but pay no mind and come here for your next Mexican feast."}
{"text":"All these reviews had to.have been friends or paid for because this place is sub par. I'm surprised they aren't closed by now.  Their food is bland and reheated or something.  Blows my mind how such a simple menu is such a challenge. Took half an hour to get two itty bitty tiny tacos and some nachos. Then to top it off the meat was gray and dead. Ingredients out of cans.

The place was clean with decent decor and had a nice bar, but that won't keep the doors open.  Perhaps Bar Rescue needs to be called in....so much potential."}
{"text":"Yikes.  Good luck trying to serve Gringo-Mex in Arizona.  The chips were stale.  The two salsas, one mild and the other (called hot) was also mild.  Both were like crushed tomatoes with no other flavor.  We ordered the avocado salsa and it was even more bland than the salsa.  Truly, no flavor, just a green, watery mixture that was the color of avocado.  The marinade for the carne was good and the corn tortillas were soft, but everything else was horrible.  The beans were bland and came out of the kitchen cold.  The \"mexican rice\" was essentially white rice with an orange-ish coloring and zero flavor.  

Why in the world they have a young white kid as the cook for a Mexican food restaurant is beyond me.  There are are so many more talented cooks available that can actually cook good Mexican food, why, oh why did you choose this guy?  Sorry Tacos and Tequilas, but unless you step up your food, this place will quickly succumb to the fate of the many restaurants before you that have tried to inhabit that space.  Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food, margaritas and customer service! We came here twice on our vacation. This family owned restaurant offers delicious, simple (in a good way) items. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce one night and chicken fajitas the next time. Both great!  The Silver dollar margaritas were smooth and delicious using local Moonshine Tequila!! Corey was an excellent bartender and waiter! So glad we found this place!!  So affordable for our family of 4! We'll be back in future trips to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Yelp showed them \"open now\" - at 10:15am... They aren't. Even though the door was open and we walked up to the bar. Bummer, it smelled good. Rating based upon inaccurate times and their grumpy \"we don't accept any Groupon or similar promotions\" sign in the window. We didn't have a Groupon, btw. We were just hungry."}
{"text":"this was the worst food I've ever had..we got sick.the rice was so salty couldn't eat it..the tacos were terrible.can't believe this place is still open..the beans were disgusting..the chips tasted like out of the bag and out of date..have not been back and none of my friends..terrible."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall place that has great authentic Mexican food and service for a great price! They also have a full bar which is always a plus. We love the salsa and beans they bring out as complimentary too."}
{"text":"Service like you have never seen & margaritas off the chain!  The kids like the creamcicle shake thingy.  

I had my wifes delicious homade quesadillas for a late lunch so I made the mistake of going full on mexican food already.  The chips come seasoned with a chili P thing & 2 salsas.  The trick is to mix the salsas.  Not bad!   We got nachos & I wasnt feeling them  - now probably over full from chips & salsa. I got the street tacos & listen... the veggie fixins and mini tortillas (very cool) were fresh, but the carne was too peppery for my tastes & overcooked (like the rice) Albeit tender & not fatty.  I tried my wifes carnita tacos & it they were excelent!

My advice is double up on margaritas and get the Carnitas! Definately coming back on kareoke night!! :D"}
{"text":"New restaurant in our neighborhood (where Gus's Pizza was), so we stopped in on their opening day. The wife had Tacos and I left it up to the 'chef' to make something special for my meal, since I love all mexican entreés... I was served al Pastor Nachos [Al pastor (from Spanish, In the style of the shepherd) is a dish developed in Central Mexico, likely as a result of the adoption of the Shawarma spit-grilled meat brought by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico]. So, is this the pride of the kitchen as it will sell me hard, so I will return... or not? As you can see in the picture it's nacho chips with a little meat some pickled jalapeño's and nacho cheese. The staff is friendly and eager for their success, and I do so hope for theirs too, I will network with friends to help them out. But when price is no object, and the customer asks for the chefs best, you need to go the extra mile and knock my shoes off to impress me. The two tacos that where ordered across from me must have be good, for I did not even get a chance to have a taste, they were scarf'd down in a minute or less for each. Her comment was that they would have been better with a chipotle cream sauce or even a basic tarter sauce to compliment the fish. Overall a commitment for excellence - that will enable them to attain the success they seek. I'll be back for them to win a couple more stars from me  ...soon"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews before going.  Place was empty yet service was extremely slow.  Servers/bartenders spent more time socializing than working.  During his break, one server went out front to smoke and spit in front of the window that was next to our table.  One of our dinner orders was wrong so my husband's meal was cold by the time my corrected meal arrived.  They can not classify this food as Mexican.  Canned green chiles, tomato sauce on rice for Spanish rice, and cold beans.  Will not go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for Happy Hour. The drinks were good. The flan for dessert and the cheese crisp were good. The street tacos were great as a base, but they needed so more salsa. The included chips and salsa and bean dip are good, though I would like to have refills included. The chicken wings were not great. I would rate it a 4 star easily, but the online happy hour menu seemed to be substantially cheaper than what was offered."}
{"text":"Once again enjoying the Posole and an Oculto. I was here for Cinco Dr Mayo with my wife. They did not expect the turnout. Rough night for the crew but we still enjoyed the tacos and Espolon reposado. I bet they will be better prepared for next year's celebration. We will be there for sure."}
{"text":"I came here for my brother's birthday and we really enjoyed ourselves! Our server was super sweet & attentive. The salsa to start off was yummy and I enjoyed their large selection of hot sauces! My dad and brother ordered the mini tacos deal and fries which they liked! And I had the guacamole & fries which I thought were delicious too! I ordered a strawberry Marg which also did not disappoint! My family lives close so I'm sure they will be back! And I will be joining when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a new restaurant come to the area, and Tacos definitely hasn't disappointed! The food is pretty good, but as a lot of others have said- the really great part is the service! It's kind of amazing to find someone who seems to care about her customers as much as the GM here does!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much! The food was tasty and fair priced. The alcohol selection is displayed front and center. It has a dive bar appeal and contemporary music. A great place for a midday drink and snack. I'll be back with a couple friends for sure!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I wanted to go out for our anniversary and we wanted tacos because it's a Tuesday so we found tacos and tequilas in north Phoenix! Definitely a dive bar/ restaurant but it was very delicious and tasty we had street tacos and fajitas and quaso everything was so good and the service was great I for sure recommend giving them a try"}
{"text":"It's a good bar with friendly staff. The food is not authentic mexican. If you want to have a drink with happy people you're in the right place. If you want a really great plate of carne asada or street tacos it is best to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great service and really good food! Happy hour until 8pm is awesome!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! Great little place to come either with friends or the family. I even been  here with my daughter and with friends for a night out. Food was great and the Prickly Pear Margarita was GREAT!! My daughter and I loved the nachos! We sorta strayed from the menu a little, but it was no sweat for them! They said 'no problem' and they came out perfect! My daughter L-O-V-E-S the green salsa, pretty tasty!! All around great place to go!!"}
{"text":"Bait shrimp. The size of my thumb.  $3.50 each?! The tortillas were awful. Service was horrid but she was nice. Can't beat the 5 for $5 street tacos, but again, tortillas- no bueno. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great local place!! Never a crazy crowd which is nice for either a date night or for a family with 3 young kids like us. The food is tasty and priced reasonably. Nothing is very expensive. There are televisions, a juke box, and is decently decorated. This place has a great mom and pop feel and is becoming our \"go to\" place when we want to go in to eat and relax. If you want a place that has good food at an average price with a kind local feel, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Will go back.  One of the best tacos I have eaten. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Not sure what is going on but the food is awful. Changes in staff? Queso used to be best in the valley; now cold, thick & flavorless. Green chili burritos are the size of a small frozen burrito; not worth $7. Mexican Pizza $11, probably cost $1 to make. Neighborhood bar, sad to see the decline. Why don't owners understand the importance of CONSISTENCY?!?"}
{"text":"Love this place me n wife r here three times a week Matt the bartender is awesome can't forget the cook he knows how to make the best enchiladas in town"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in based on the high reviews on Yelp.  I guess I should have read the negative ones, because they were spot on.  We walked in and it was pretty busy. First off, you can't tell if you wait to be seated, so we should stood at the door for a few minutes.  Then we walked over to a table and a lady (I guess she worked there) said to sit anywhere. So, we picked a table and waited.  10 minutes passed and no one came to talk to us.  We gave up and left.  We won't be back, it didn't look that special,  and the service was nonexistent."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a star is cause the food is pretty good and the service staff and bartender is good. The owner always comes in and drinks too much. I noticed that he would get In the way of the bartender and poor himself a drink, he needs to let his employees do their job.. and stay the hell away from the bar. He's a drunk and always talks about himself... no thanks"}
{"text":"Walked in - walked out - you can tell when Sam isn't there or the regular cook.  The waitress was super rude and could care less if we left or not.  If I have to rely on the right staff being there, I'll pass.  Sad -"}
{"text":"Now our go to from Uber eats! The chicken enchiladas are amazing and my family wants to live on the carne Asada fajitas. Love!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this so called Restaurant last night with my family.  The 3 of use ordered Burritos and son ordered pancakes .  All Burritos came out together. But Pancakes came out 15 min later.  I asked waitress on why the easiest item comes out later then the hardest. She couldn't answer. The our waiter was asked the same question and all he can say it's to bad he has other customers he is working on and helping cooking in kitchen and then started with being nasty and rude.  Then he has the nerve to threaten my son and tells him if he doesn't like it he would take it outside and fight. I told his cocky ass to back off or I will personally take that challenge.  He then runs off to kitchen and never seen again.  Not only will I never return but I will be contacting the owner.  This is the kind of place that you see on TV.   Music is loud and food is Nasty. Save your money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Never got to try the food due to lack of service.  When we arrived we didnt know if we needed to grab a seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us. I asked lady behind the counter who stated to find a seat. We had to sit at a dirty table and waited for a waitress who never came to clean the table or take our order. Only saw two people working. After sitting and waiting for a while we decided to go some where else. There were others who had to leave  due to lack of service. I am surprised they had only 2 people working since it was a busy Saturday.."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a whim over the weekend because it's close to home.  Our server was really nice and friendly but service overall was slow - took a long time to get waters, refills, and our food.  But not her fault - it was really busy and I think there were only 2 people working.  I had the monster burrito which was decent, but not the best burrito ever or anything.  My husband had 4 street tacos which were tiny but delicious.  He devoured them in about 1 minute.  They have probably 20 or so different kinds of hot sauces you can add to your food.  The one thing here that got 5 stars from me was the 80's music they were playing!  Absolutely awesome!  The thing I liked least was the chips.  They were not legit - they were like doritos.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Tuesday and tried the 5 for $5 street tacos special. Tacos were very tasty with meat that was well seasoned. Refried beans were very good. Rice had good flavor, but was slightly undercooked. My husband had a three enchilada meal, which he enjoyed. The red enchilada sauce was flavorful, and slightly spicy.  We really enjoyed the chips and salsa prior to the meal, especially the chile con carne dip that came with the chips. We tried the flan for dessert. Not my favorite flan, but overall a very good meal for the price. . . $23 for two dinners, two soft drinks, and one dessert. I will definitely return. Service was prompt and friendly even though they were short staffed."}
{"text":"Quesadilla steak and steak nachos.  This place is awesome and wish it had a location on the east side.  Always go there for the best quesadilla that I've ever had.  One is enough to split unless you're really hungry."}

See me try out your Tacos
With your margarita picks   
Out for all that I can taste
If you know what I mean

Onions to the left of it
And onions to the right
Ain't got no rice
Ain't got no beans
Don't you start with carbs

Cause it's T & T, it's Tequila
T & T, and I'll sing the song
T & T, it's a cheesy load
T & T, watch me review


Tacos & Tequilas a pretty solid joint for a quick bite of some redefined Mexican style food.

I came with a large group of people and they were able to accommodate us somewhat, but I get it; can be tough.  My server was working her butt off so I didn't have any qualms, but I think one of our guest was a tad bit irked.  

Moreover, I proceeded with my orders of their loaded fries called \"Dave's\" Loaded Carne Asada Fries; I reckon Dave's the owner or an acronym of sort.  Anyways, I chose the fingerling fries over the string to give it some girth.  The fries were topped with creamy queso, shredded cheddar, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and carne asada.  Overall, a solid cheesy bite and best with your beer or margarita.  The carne asada was sparingly sprinkled across the dish, but still a good start.  

For my tacos I went for the street tacos and the carne asada and drunken chicken.  Both were topped with onions and cilantro.  I would say the carne asada was what I expected to be with a sprinkle of some lime; it was a decent bite.  The drunken chicken was marinated and shredded, but I really couldn't tell the difference once I added the lime besides the texture.  

Needless to say, TnT did a great job service wise from my stand point.  I worked in the industry and the hustle and bustle is just part of it.  The food here is solid with some minor hits or miss depending on what you expect, but I would say overall, come take a bite and try one of their margaritas.  The place definitely has some tack, but that shouldn't be a surprise with a name like Tacos & Tequila. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time this week. Very friendly staff. Our food was good and came out promptly. Great Margaritas & a good beer selection. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"what a great surprise to find that the horrible pizza place has turned into a fantastic little Mexican restaurant! This place has excellent service and to-die-for street tacos! Pretty good selection of beers on tap as well as what ever mix drinks you could ever want. Another great thing for me was the jalapeño avocado salsa. ¡Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go not realizing it was Cinco de Mayo. Was quoted about fifteen minutes. Two plus hours later my food was finally ready. We got a drunken chicken taco, jalapeño poppers, green chili mac and cheese, and chicken fajitas. The jalapeño poppers were SO spicy they were inedible, the mac and cheese was dry, the chicken taco was bland, and I didn't get the chicken fajitas. Instead I was given what looked like beef stew. I probably didn't choose the best night to try this place for the first time, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Thos is nothing lije Macayos or Ajo Als, but if you like cool. But the flavor here is REAL!
great prices, good TVs, cute bartender. 
Best part is that i5asked for no onions and they said, no problem. That's what I like."}
{"text":"Service and food used to be so much better here. The staff is more interested in socializing with each other than the customer themselves. Even heard a few \"F bombs\" from one of the employees.  New management also. Didn't even get a hello. Used to all the time from the old management. Went without a drink for 20 minutes before anyone noticed...AND WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR! AND one of the only ones left. SMH. So dissapointed. Used to really like this place. The only thing I can say are the wings are still good. No more Tacos and Tequila for me. At least not the restaurant."}
{"text":"The silver coin margaritas are to die for .   The chips and salsa really good !   We did come right in after a rush and they were shortstaffed.The.  Bartender really went the extra mile to take care of us .  I got the cheese  enchiladas and they were good but they were a bit cold.   The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the rice. It needed  more flavoring .  But we will be back."}
{"text":"Food: A+ 
Service: A+
Cleanliness: A+

I was very impressed with this restaurant!! Small hole in the wall, but authentic and delicious Mexican food and although it was a very long wait (a large to go order was  placed same time as ours) the service was amazing and I appreciate them being upfront on the long wait! Margaritas were good and they had the sports playing on the tv's for the boyfriend, so he was happy. So happy to discover this place, plus just minutes away from my home!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican food. Boyfriend and I come here all the time. Love the green chile pork. Staff is super nice. It's a little hole in the wall, but the food is amazing!! Oh... And the beer is cold! :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch. Nice quite place, the food is generally good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Fun casual place to get street tacos. Excellent service and great selection of tequila. We will be back."}
{"text":"Good local Mexican American cooking, price isn't bad. Street tacos recommended. .clean and staff is nice"}
{"text":"Update: went back and tried in person-WAY better. Got the street tacos that are 3 for 5 dollars on Tuesday and Thursday. I got one shredded beef, one carne aside and one drunken chicken. DELICIOUS. Also got their margs that are $4.00 at happy hour. They were so good! The chips and salsa were delicious per usual. Tracy was such an amazing waitress-we will be coming back! 



This place is right by my house and we've been dying to try it. We saw a Groupon and were going to order carry out, but luckily we asked before buying the Groupon and found out it only applies for dine in. I don't quite understand why that is, but that's a whole different argument. The meal cost around 65 dollars for 4 meals and 4 appetizers, so it was pretty decently priced. But the Groupon would have been nice for a first time trying the place. They offer 10 dollars for 20 dollars worth of food on Groupon. 

We got jalapeño poppers (can't remember their specific name for these), chips, red salsa, guacamole, a bean and cheese burrito, two monster burritos and a drunken chicken taco bowl. The two things that were REALLY good were the chips and salsa and the jalapeño poppers. The chips are different because they are coated in a red chili-like powder, but we really enjoyed them. The bean and cheese burrito was good, but you can't really mess that up. 

My family said that the monster burritos were just okay. One was ordered regular and one chimichanga style. They preferred the shredded beef over the carne asada, but said that both burritos were very short on meat. My sister loved her drunken chicken taco bowl, but be aware that there is a lot of dark meat in it, which she wasn't a huge fan of. My brother in law said that the dark meat was delicious haha. So it depends on your preferences. 

Overall, the place was so-so. We will probably go back to try again and will possibly do the Groupon deal for dine in just because it is so close, but I do think there are more authentic places in our area."}
{"text":"Went again last night, Friday night, and this place is really getting great. This is a casual place, but the atmosphere is very comfortable and the people running it are very friendly. They have really got the food down to a science now, this is very authentic styled Mexican food. Ask for their hot sauce along with the salsa, the hot sauce is fiery but delicious. This place is also inexpensive for what you get, really one of the better Mexican food places around now, you have to try it."}
{"text":"I love tequila almost more than tacos and this place has an amazing variety of both! I stopped in for take-out and had such an amazing experience at the bar with the owner Dan that I stayed until my husband could meet up! My favorite things were the fresh habanero salsa and the tequila of the week deals! I can't wait to stop in for a fajita Friday and their yummy bacon wrapped jalapeños!"}
{"text":"Great local place! The fiancé and I went in for the tacos and we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The House Margarita taste exceptionally clean and refreshing and isn't overly sweet. You can't go wrong with the street tacos....Green chili pork, Drunken chicken and shredded chicken were excellent. Three would fill you up with chips and salsa. The guacamole had tomatoes in it and was very good. As this is a short drive from the house, we'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's hard to find and it didn't come up on yelp initially. There are a ton of places with this name, but this place is worth searching out. Great queso dip, great prices, good service, they have every sport playing on the screens. They really have it all. We will make this a regular place and will be going for lunch tomorrow:)"}
{"text":"We came here because of the good Yelp reviews but were disappointed overall. When we arrived, there were only 6 patrons in the place including us; so I figured it could just be a hidden gem. It wasn't. The bartender was our server and asked us what would we like to drink. Since the place has the word \"tequila\" in its name, I was excited to hear the different margaritas that they made. The answer was two: house, and grapefruit. I got the house, my boyfriend got the grapefruit. They both tasted watered down, and made with cheap, bottom shelf tequila. 

Next, we ordered food: street tacos (carne asada, and chicken), loaded nachos with chicken, and pozole. The carne asada was prepared in a way that made me think it was ground beef at first; and chewy. The nachos were made with what tasted like cheese wiz or canned cheese. The pozole was actually good, except that it was not hot. If the pozole was actually hot, I would have given 2 stars instead of one.

Highlights: bartender was nice, pozole was good (but not hot)

Low lights: NOT authentic mexican, food quality is poor, drinks are not good, nothing special about the place.

This would be a nice neighborhood place, hope they improve."}
{"text":"We have passed by this place over the last few weeks and have been wanting to try it. Jeannie and I pulled the trigger for a Friday happy hour and glad we did.  Great service and good food.  Sampled the carne asada nachos, chips and salsa, wings, and several margaritas!   The wings were super good! Enjoyed all our food and the house margaritas are served up perfectly.  

This will probably become our go to happy hour place in the area.  Prices are right  and the Renee has the staff really focused on customer satisfaction.  

Thinking this will be a good place to watch football or any sporting event.  The tvs are set up well enough for it and all day happy hour on Sunday.  

Get in here and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, drinks are great and amazing food, I had the Romaine salad, wonderful taste and very courteous staff! Price is good to."}
{"text":"I got 2 street supreme tacos al pastor, they're good. I give the place 3 stars simply because it's a bar and I went in midday on a Wednesday. I'll definitely be going back to see what the real atmosphere is like"}
{"text":"Quiet little restaurant  (not sure if this is normal or not).  Our server, who was also the bartender, was AWESOME.  Three of us came here, while visiting from Colorado, and all got something different.  Everything we ordered was wonderful (streets tacos, Carne asada fries, and tostadas).  If you like spice ask for the hot salsa."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. Carnitas tacos and a few cold beers and you can't go wrong.  Wonderful staff and killer food.  My new favorite place.  Stop in - you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"The appearance is nice for a family owned place, the bar is amazing and I like the jukebox music selection. I feel like this could be a great place to go at night with friends for drinks and food as a starter before moving to a club or outdoor bar,  but I can totally picture myself staying in drinking with friends until last call. 

The menu is decent, again for a family owned place. And the food is perfect. The street taco selections are awesome I tried one of each all very good. I've had the Menudo before, delicious. They give you fresh salsa and beans with chips which I like a lot. The best part about the food is its not your average greasy Mexican food. It's almost like they took a little healthier approach to the types of Mexican meals we love . It all  tasted so flavorful just like when I go and visit family in Mexico. 

Prices are almost too low for how good the place is and that right there makes this place a gem in the world of modern neighborhood bar/restaurants. 

Service was friendly and the house margarita was amazing. 

I really want this place to succeed i really like the vibe and the food. So I definitely recommend you check it out and spread the word."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for the first time today, shredded chicken enchiladas, green chili burro and bean burros for the kids. I'm from a small town with predominately Mexican food restaurants and it was up there with my home town food. The Spanish rice was sooo good too. I'm excited to find a good place that is close to home!"}
{"text":"TNT poppers and chicken rolled tacos for the win! So many tequilas to choose from but you definitely won't be disappointed in the House marg too. Glad we stopped by. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and have been looking for a local place for nice drinks, good Mexican food, and not super busy.  Hubby had a prickly pear margarita & I had a house, along with queso, street tacos, and a shrimp tostada... And they were all delicious!!  And the chips & salsa were the best out of the other local Mexican places we've tried the last few days.   We met the owner, who was had some of the best, friendly customer service we've recently had.  He did tell us that he took over the place earlier this year, which made us very glad we didn't follow reviews from more than 6 months ago.  We will definitely come back.  Thank you for a great, relaxing evening with good food."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. Not the best I've ever had, but good service, small/quiet atmosphere, and nice happy hour specials."}
{"text":"5 beers on tap! Delicious tacos and monster burrito! Yummy green chili burrito - my hubby is originally from Albuquerque and loves him some green chili! Tons of tequila. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I gave it a one, only because you can't give a 0. Went in on Friday night at approx. 6:30. Put in a to go order and the food took over an hour to get to the table. The waitress didn't even come back to let us know what was going to going on. Got one meal, and the other took 10 minutes more. Only saving grace was another server offered us a beer. We paid, and returned home to enjoy our food. Only to dig in, and the food was COLD. The second meal was not at all what was ordered. After an hour wait, and the place wasn't even full of customers."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and still want to like it. I'm new to the area, looking for decent Mexican food.  Showed up at 730 pm on Saturday and we were literally the only people there. Service was amazing. Food was good. Prices excellent. I hope they get enough business to keep going. Would love to see food enhanced to bring it from the expected to something new.  The monster burrito was too big for me!  Seems like great people that work there, hope they can figure out yo to drum up more business. Oh wait, hungry for Mexican?  Check this place out!keess"}
{"text":"Literally a joke!!!

Just paid $7 for a burrito that was so small it fit in a hot dog container!!!! Seriously?!? This place is an absolute joke! 

Never ordering from h"}
{"text":"My fiancé really enjoys tacos and we just moved up to this area so we thought we'd give it a try.

To get straight to the point, the tacos were very disappointing. The drunken chicken tacos were absolutely disgusting, they tasted of pure tequila. My friend who came with us said the same thing, he didn't even eat his. I was told the chicken was soaked in tequila so maybe that's my fault, however, gross I don't know how those are sold. The green chili pork tacos were complete mush. 

The queso dip was legitimately chunky velveeta cheese with tomatoes on top, really gross. Their jalapeños with cream cheese wrapped in bacon were the only thing on the menu we enjoyed and the beer. Other than that, I will not be coming back to this place again. 

Service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Just Tacos  & Tequila would be fine for this establishment!! Not the greatest location but it's otw to Cave Creek-  There's extensive levels of Tequila !
Friendly & Quick service Be sure 2say Hi 2 Dan
Ask about their hot sauces!!   Oh, Body shots anyone?!!"}
