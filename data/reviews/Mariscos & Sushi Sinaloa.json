{"text":"The best mariscos sushi, the seafood is nice and tender the flavor is the food throughout, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Real friendly staff. Greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. We only purchased food to go to give it a try. We tried the Tostadas de Bruja and it's worth every penny. Great big portion and flavor throughout. We will definitely be back for the dine in experience."}
{"text":"First and most important this is not your typical \"mariscos\" restaurant?.  They have a small menu.  Very basic. Tostastas, cocteles, molcajetes and sushi. Now let me tell u about the taste.  OMG. I WAS IMPRESSED. I'm a huge sushi fan and to be honest I didn't think I was going to like it. But it was GOOOOOOD.  The tostada? bruja was really good. The coctel de camarones was okay.  We will be back. Especially when they start selling beer lol."}
{"text":"We were very optimistic to try this place out as we had read some of the reviews here on yelp. However after our experience today we will not be returning! The sushi had no flavor, chips and salsa were store bought, and took them forever to bring us our food. I gave them 1 star because our waitress was kind enough to speak to her manager so we wouldn't have to pay (this was the only good part of the entire experience). I do not recommend this place for sushi!"}
