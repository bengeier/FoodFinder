{"text":"Second time in. It's just plain delicious. Dan serves the best fish & chips either of us have ever had, and his buttermilk dipping sauce recipe is fantastic enough that we buy extra to take home."}
{"text":"Coming from Seattle I know what it's like to get good fish and chips. After 25 years finally a place in Las Vegas that has absolutely the freshest, flaky, flavorful fish. Absolutely the best Fish & Chips I've had in years. This will definitely be my go-to place probably at least once or twice a  week. I can't wait to try everthing on the menu. The place is clean & and the Owner/Chef Dan has a passion for high quality. I can't wait to recommend Guy Fieri feature this place on Triple D.  Definitely Off The Hook!!! I'm hooked, you will be too."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town! Clean restaurant with great customer service. The fish was fresh and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Great food! The breading on the fish is perfect. I had the fish tacos and the fish was a nice consistency and was drizzled with a great sauce. I have been there twice now, and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place because I had read another review. Well I wish I hadn't. The shrimp was dry and old. Everything on the plate had to be soaked in something in order to be choked down. I  definitely wouldn't order from them again."}
{"text":"Went with a friend because mainly of Yelp reviews, looks like it's under new management and food isn't anything like any previous Yelper's comments, cod was smaller pieces than Ellis Island and it was rather luke warm on the inside when it supposedly just came out of the fryer."}
{"text":"These guys were great! i came in with a friend and before even ordering i knew it, because you could smell it! The service was very attentive since its just a little family business, they care and Felicia was awesome. I had the mahi mahi fish tacos because I didn't feel like having THAT much fried food and my friend got fish and chips and the fried twinkies, but I couldn't help myself and we ended up splitting the tacos and the fish and chips, both were great, the place reminded me of a fish and chips place next to santa monica definitely haven't been somewhere like this in Vegas before."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!  The fish, scallops and prawns were amazing!  The deep fried cheesecake was amazing!  We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I can't find anything to complain about.  I went to eat here with my kids and they are picky eaters.  They hate seafood but for some reason they like fish and chips.  I read the reviews going into Off the Hook so I was mindful of some of the negative comments.   We ate the Family basket of Fish and Chips.  The fish tasted clean and I agree with the management rebuttal about lack of taste. Cod should be clean and fresh tasting.  It's not like Salmon that has a more flavorful taste. The condiments were good at adding flavor to the Cod.  The Coleslaw was not overbearing, not the most flavorful but again, tasted clean and fresh.  I can handle that.     The family basket came with hush puppies, maybe a little overlooked, but not enough to deduct a star because they still tasted great.  I dipped the fish and hush puppies in a tangy orange colored type sauce that's probably got ketchup, mayonnaise and some seasoning mixed in. That was really good.  The fries were cooked right, not over cooked, not soggy and not undercooked.   My kids like this place and so did I.  Like I said, they are picky.  As far as the price, almost $30 for the family basket not including drinks. Not cheap but not too expensive.  You go to any bar in town and Fish and Chips is easily $10/person.  So Off the Hook was about the same.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos. My wife and I both loved them. Service was great and they were really nice to the kids; very accommodating. I can't say enough about the tacos. I wouldn't change anything about them! Highly recommend everyone to eat here."}
{"text":"Didn't eat at this place for a while decided to come back. Price when up the roof. 4 pieces of fish and some fries cost $80. Could of go all you can eat sushi with 3 people with that price."}
{"text":"I've had fish and chips at a lot of places and I have to say Off the Hook is off the chain.  Best I ever had.   The store was very clean as well."}
{"text":"Excellent fish! The batter was the best I ever tried!! Didn't care for lobster roll. It came with 4 langostinos & imatation crab! Not a lobster roll!  Should be called lobstah roll. Wasn't very good, had a bite only!! Gross! Don't order, I guess hence the price! The mahimahi with fries was tasty, but only a few small pieces of mahimahi grilled on top!  Sauce was very tasty & spicy. I would definitely stick to the fish only!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Went there because of a groupon, but will definitely be back in the future. The food was great, the restaurant very clean, and the owner who seems to wear every hat there, was extremely friendly. Fish and chips were great. I don't usually ever like coleslaw, but I was shocked at how good it was. Finished the meal with the the deep fried raspberry cheesecake which was beyond yummy. Can't wait for the next visit. Already planning on those fish tacos next. :)"}
{"text":"Quality of food is excellent, if only the service was close. Eaten several times. Two days in a row I ordered a delivery of premium fish and chips along with hush puppies and a dessert. Total with tip $30. Money well spent the first day. Best fish and chips I've eaten. The second day they sent no silverware my ice cream was jammed in the same container as the pie. The bottom of the container was in the pie, and my biggest issue No \"malt vinegar\". I don't eat the fish without. I called in to have a young girl answer. I told her my experience and she said \"OK\". With little care that I was not eating the food because they failed to fulfill the order. Will not eat a 3rd day anytime soon. Lost a fan!"}
{"text":"I spent some time in England some years ago and fell in love with their authentic fish and chips, so I've been on a constant search for something similar, and this place does a good job.  We had never heard of this place before Groupon, so that was what brought us in, and I'm glad we went.  The portion sizes were good, and they even brought me an extra piece because he said my pieces were a little small, but the two piece was perfect for me already.  I definitely appreciated the extra service.  It was a little slow when we went in around 2:00 on a Saturday, so the gentlemen who took our order ended up chatting with us some when he wasn't serving the few other customers.  Malt vinegar on every table - LOVE that I didn't have to ask for it.  The place isn't on our side of town, but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best fish and chip place in town.. I'm only saying this because  unfortunately I  had fish and chips today at a different place today and it was no where near the quality of Off the hooks. I'll be back soon.."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fish & chips I've had in Las Vegas thus far.  I've been looking for really good fish & chips since moving here a few months ago.  I've tried Nine Fine Irishmen (NYNY), RiRa (Mandalay Bay), McMullan and Crown & Anchor.  Off the Hook is hands down the best (a 8 out of 10)!  Nine Fine Irishmen is not bad (7 out of 10), and you can forget the rest (probably better off buying the frozen fish from the grocery store and oven bake them yourself).  The fish at Off the Hook is super tender & moist on the inside but very nice and crispy on the outside in a light batter.  Exactly the way it should be done.  If you're a serious fan of British-style fish & chips, do yourself a favor and check out this neighborhood joint.  I'm certainly glad I did today...finally found myself some awesome fish & chips here in Sin City."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've found. Great food and friendly people. A good price to go with it. What more can you ask for? Oh yes, small business the way to go. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"I understand the logistical issues behind serving \"fresh\" seafood in the desert. But don't serve me food that was obviously frozen and purport it not be so. I paid a lot of money for freshness and it was not delivered. Also might want to consider marinating or seasoning the meat itself and not just the undercooked breading. All that said the food is edible just not terribly satisfying. First thought that came to mind as I was leaving, now what am I actually going to eat."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! We had been wanting to try this joint for a while and finally got the chance tonight. As soon as we walked in we were greeted. The place was clearly busy with only the owner there to manage all the orders, but he was able to serve everyone equally. Food was fantastic. The best fish n chips in lad Vegas by far. He went above and beyond by providing a small tray and extra small pieces of fish for my two yr old who devoured it. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"There are three things that bothered me about my visit to this restaurant, and two things that I enjoyed.  *  I purchased a Groupon and when I got there, I found out there were restrictions on what I could order.  I went back and checked, and it was clearly stated on the Groupon, yet I was still annoyed.  I wasn't allowed to order the shrimp or scallops.  That made no sense to me.  Why are they limiting my selections?    *   This place is a fast food joint, yet they are trying to force table service into a facility that clearly isn't designed for it.  It just seems silly that I can't order my food at the counter and take my tray back to my table.  But okay, if you want to have a server come to my table and take my order, then spruce things up.  Put in real tables, not the Burger King things that are there.  Don't serve me food in plastic baskets.  Don't give me plastic knives and forks.    *   The prices are outrageous.  It's a fish fry.  Two pieces of fried cod, french fries, cole slaw, and a pop are going to run you seventeen dollars.  Everything is expensive on the menu.  For the prices they charge, I expect a lot better ambiance and presentation.    *   Our server was nice.  Charlotte, I believe was her name.  She seemed invested in making us have a positive experience, so that was welcomed.  *   The food was somewhere between good and excellent.  The fries were nothing special but fine.  The cole slaw was above average.  The fried cod was perfectly cooked - flaky and moist.  The batter was just okay for me.  After a conversation, I was allowed to order the blackened shrimp appetizer and it was outstanding.  The tartar sauce, also, was very impressive.  It was thinner than one would normally see with nice lemon notes to it.  A far cry from your typical mayonnaise mixed with pickle relish.    I wouldn't be against returning because the food is good.  However, I can't bring myself to pay these kind of prices when I can get the same type of food at Long John Silver's for a fraction of the cost.  Not as good - no doubt.  But it's fried fish.  I find it difficult to get too snobby about any food you batter and throw in hot oil."}
{"text":"I tasted the skipper meal and I loved the cod fish and prawns but not a fan of the scallops.  Overall great place to eat and customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I've had in Vegas! Service is great as well. Simple and delicious- definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Owner is great. He really cares about the food and the quality he's serving. Well worth every penny. Cajun prawns are a MUST HAVE! :)"}
{"text":"Owner may think his place is the best fish and chips in Vegas BUT he has delusions of grandeur.  Not convenient location for most people, prices above average for average taste.  Much lower price, better tasting is on Fridays at Sundance Grill in SILVERTON Casino.  For $9 one gets soup or salad, basket of fish AND shrimp and fries and coleslaw with non-alcoholic drink.  Great price and tasty but it is only available on FRidays."}
{"text":"I would have fish n chips about every week living in NorCal and thank god this place opened!! Every other fish n chips i have tried since moving to LV has been big disappointments.  Off the hook is exactly what the name says, it's OFF THE HOOK!!!  This might be the first and only time I leave a fish n chips joint with a full belly but not with a belly full of grease.  I don't know how they do it but they do it great.  Will be coming back at least once a week for more! Easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had been missing great Fish and Chips since I moved here from Cali, but at the request of my mother, I tried Off the Hook. What a delightful surprise! Of course the owners are from Cali so of course they make fabulous fish and chips. So stoked that I live only a short distance from here. Thank you for bringing a bit of the beach to this misplaced Cali kid!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place!  We were craving fish and chips - everything was yummy!  Also got the scallops and coleslaw which was also so very good!  Will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with my sister and dad. Since I moved here from San Diego I have been craving some good fried fish. Done, Done and done. It was AWESOME!!. Had some shrimp (which come with cajun rub) fish and french fries. Everything was great, even the slaw and the Tarter (which they offer reg or with capers)It could be a little cheaper but waygdr. I will def make this a reg stop but Im by Aliante. FRENCH FRIES DROWNED IT MALT VINEGAR AND DIPPED IN KETCHUP. YESSIRR...."}
{"text":"Just ate there with a party of 5 adults 2 babies and 2 toddlers. The owner/manager went out of his way to move tables around for us to fit everyone in. He also made sure we always had refills. All around great service and atmosphere and everyone working was extremely friendly and the food was incredible. The fish n chips here are the best I have ever had. If you are visiting Vegas like I was or live here this is a place that you must try. Worth every penny and will be coming back here next time I am in town"}
{"text":"There aren't any good fish & chip places in Las Vegas until I found this! First of all the owner is really nice & was patient as my friend & I were asking what everything was. Second, the place was clean & was comfortable to sit down & eat! The Cajun fish was amazingly delicious and I am so happy I found a place with real, tasty fish & chips! It hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place!!  Came early on a Friday evening...only ones in the place, so I was a bit nervous....but not for long.  As soon as the food came I was a happy camper.  I had the catfish.  Lightly breaded in cornmeal and fried perfectly.  Not greasy at all.  And the fries and hush puppies were just as good.  See you soon for another plate of yummy fried food."}
{"text":"Great place for good fish however would be nice to see real chips/fries to go with the nice seafood. I will return again for sure"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and garlic fries!!! The sauce on the tacos was spicy and tasty.  Mmmm.  Quick and professional service with a smile. Only 4/5 stars because the scalding hot clam chowder burned the mess out of my tongue. The garlic bread that was served with the chowder was warm and soft...perfect.  I'll return but next time I will wait 15 minutes before trying the chowder."}
{"text":"Great place for fish & chips, pricy lunch but worth every penny. This place is 40 minutes from my work & I'll drive over there again next time I have that crave. Don't go here & not try the prawns, they are amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent fish very fresh! Great coleslaw and fries too! No grease smell was a plus! Great service and very friendly"}
{"text":"YUM!!! Hands down the BEST fish n chips this side of the equator! My husband is from New Zealand and grew up on fish n chips! Off the hook is great food for my homesick husband! Also...you MUST try the deep fried cheesecake! Omg!!!! Amazing! And the owner is awesome, so friendly and down to earth! Thanks to our dear friends for showing us this Las Vegas GEM!"}
{"text":"this place is definitely off the hook!  you must make it here for the big chunks of cod they use . will definitely visit often.  you must check this place out!!!! 5 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. I had a hankering for some good fish and chips, so I decided to check this place out. It looks like nothing from the outside, but it's very clean and cute inside. I ordered the 5 piece fish and chips, and a grilled cheese for my kids to share. I could have gotten the three piece and been very satisfied though. BIG pieces of fish. Crispy batter, flaky fish. The fries weren't anything special, but the Cole-slaw was pretty amazing. I think it's the pepper in the sauce?? The house-made tartar sauce was pretty freaking unbelievable also. I may have started dipping my fries in it when the fish was gone... and then started looking around for more food to dip in it. No shame! I want to try the fish tacos next time. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips I've ever had! Very fresh tasting! The portions are overly generous, you will definitely have left over to take home! The Deep fried cheesecake is my favorite dessert, you have to save room for this for sure! Great service and great food! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Food is greasy, fishy old product.  I ate here all the time but won't now.  Greasy and the fish was nasty. Also overcharged me twice 4.00 more than the menu on yelp and them blamed it on yelp.  Good luck treating people like this."}
{"text":"This is a great fish n chips spot. I live in the southwest but will travel here to satisfy any of my fish n chips cravings! The fish they use taste fresh as well as there scallops! The batter is perfect , not too greasy. My only problem is the way it makes my car smell in transport..lol not there problem, but I'm trying to think of a solution. The only reason it's not five stars is the price, a little high, but I also understand it probably goes to quality of seafood. Maybe they can start a frequent buyers card..lol"}
{"text":"Nice clean operation run by a well intended personable young man.   I sensed it is a one man run restaurant, as he handled everything.  Anyhow, to the food.....I had the combo, one piece cod, 3 scallops, 2 huge fresh shrimp. ($15.00)  The shrimp were honestly some of the best I have had in Vegas; very good size, fresh and scrumptious. The cod was just OK, had better, had worse, homemade sauce that was ranch dressing based.   Afterwards he told me he had another sauce option, I am a hard core tarter sauce person, ranch doesn't get it.  The scallops were a waste of money, barely quarter sized and bland....  The cole slaw was OK, not special, fries decent.  My wife had the fish tacos,($9.00) the 3 tacos were very good although small.  They had  a slightly sweet chili sauce mix, cabbage, pico, avocodo.   I was a small business operator, and realize how tuff it is too make a go of it.    He has been open barely 3 months and paying his dues in the business world, I hope it works out for him.  His  seafood prices are very high compared to a larger operation, probably due to his low volume. He is still tweaking his menu and offerings.  I would go back for the shrimp...."}
{"text":"Pleasantly pleased! Ordered the one piece cod meal it was very good! From Seattle found a place to go for fish n chips in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We just at Off the Hook today. Best fish and chips I've ever had! You have to try the deep fried scallops and shrimp which were incredible. My wife and I also had the deep fried Oreos with ice cream and deep fried twinkles which were to die for. Our first time here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best fish n chips I've had. I ordered the large because I came in with an appetite, and I was planning on letting my aunt have a bite of my food anyway. (Large comes with 4pc of fish, chips, and a side of their homemade Cole slaw +tartar sauce)  I expected each piece of fish to be average sized (every other place I've been to have had similar sized pieces) but these came out scorching hot, and each piece was the size of a toddler's arm! They don't over-cook their fish like some places, so every piece was perfectly crispy on the outside and flakey/ JUST cooked through on the inside. Not dry at all! After pummeling through 3/4 of the chips and 2 toddler-arm sized pieces of fish, I was stuffed and satisfied.   I also have to commend them on their tartar sauce and Cole slaw. The tartar sauce is thick and on point. The Cole slaw actually has good flavor, and is pickled enough unlike most other slaws that just come out tasting kind of like bland, wet cabbage.   Overall 5 stars for quality of good, as well as service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and boy are we glad we decided to drop by here!  We ordered the Codfather and drop fried cheese cake - definitely good for 2.  It was perfectly battered and fried - no greasy feeling afterwards.  Fast, friendly service - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Get your fish fix here!!!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because this was my first experience and have more to try on the menu.  The Fish is fresh and delicious!  I've seen reviews stating the fish batter was bland; I beg to differ!  It was just enough to compliment the fish and allows you to get a delicious crunchy bite. The chips were cooked perfectly. The coleslaw was yummy, my only suggestion would be some celery seed to add the additional kick of flavor.  You can taste the passion that comes from the kitchen.   The woman behind the counter was very kind. The positive attitude from those working gives yet another reason to come out and support them.    I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm a long time lurker of yelp.  I've used it 100s of times when traveling to find top restaurants in unfamiliar cities.  I have never left a review before.  Usually the good places have plenty of reviews so adding one more doesn't seem necessary.   Off the Hook was so good that it got me out of my normal lethargy.  I'm a self proclaimed  fish n chip expert.  I've tried it in countless restaurants throughout the US, through Asia, Europe, (Brits are everywhere!), and around 20 renowned places throughout the United Kingdom.  Off the Hook is one of the top 5 Fish and Chips places I've ever been to.  It's truly excellent.  I can't believe that such a great place is hidden away in the desert.    The fish is excellent quality cod and has a good flake to it.  The breading is close to perfect.  It's light but has the perfect crunch without being greasy.  The chips are more American style than English, so a visiting Belt might quibble with this aspect.  To an American though these fries will be much more pleasing.  They're close but not quite as good as 5 guys fries, for the east coasters reading this, which to me are the pinnacle of American fries.  I can't recommend this place enough. My first thought was that a bit pricey but I quickly discarded thought after my first bite.  Its worth every penny.  If this guy was on the Strip he could be charging double and it would be considered one of the  great Strip food deals.  To top it off, the owner/cook was a super nice guy.   If you're a local and don't go here regularly, for shame!  Visitors find a way to go if you're a fish and chips fan.  It's worth the effort."}
{"text":"Very nice to see an off-Strip fish and chips place again here on the southwest side of Vegas...the food was very good and we got more than expected...all of us needed boxes for leftovers the next day.  A little on the pricey side, but still very good food."}
{"text":"I can eat Fish and Chips again because of your gluten free batter!!!! Delicious!!!! Ordered take out and first time this evening ate at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery twice from this place & it is AWESOME! Honestly haven't had anything that wasn't really good! Shrimp, Cajun catfish bites, burger, coleslaw, hush puppies all good!"}
{"text":"First time here seen the fb advertising for \"all you can eat fish & chips\". Had a taste for French fries & something crunchy.  The restaurant had a good feel to it. Nice & clean. The staff was polite and always checking up on the guests. Chose to dine in to get something off the menu not the all you can eat.  I ordered the Medium Fish & Chips comes with 2 large pieces of Fish (Cod) with French fries & Coleslaw. The fish came out hot & fresh. The fish batter was just right (not over battered). Crispy & tasty. The French fries seasoned well & crunchy.  Chose malt vinegar with my fish which made it taste even better.   Good place for Fish & Chips. Will surely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"What a revelation this place is!!!!! I was searching for the best fish and chips place in Las Vegas online, and after reading several reviews, I took a transplanted New Englander here today -- and they absolutely loved it, as did I! The food was amazing!!!!!!! We ordered the 2 pieces of fish and chips (we actually ordered it with half fries and half onion rings) that came with the most delicious clearly homemade cole slaw (I got an extra side order) and equally tasty tartar sauce, that had just the right amount of subtle flavor. The fish was fried to perfection -- each piece was SO flaky and tender inside, and the batter (perfect and light!) was nice and crispy outside. The portions were huge, and we were both impressed that the entire restaurant was spotless. Everything was so clean! The owners are a father and son who apparently took over this restaurant recently -- and they couldn't have been nicer. Angelo (the son) greeted and waited on us. He's a genuinely sweet guy -- the entire vibe of the place was SO welcoming! My lunch guest is disabled, and Angelo couldn't have been more loving, patient and accommodating. I saw that they had a Treasure Chest on the counter with little toys and treats for kids -- and I thought that this place would be perfect for bringing children to. While we didn't have dessert, next time I'd love to try a fried Oreo cookie... My guest and I were really blown away by how delicious everything was, and by the friendly, loving atmosphere that was made that way by the wonderful owners who also work there (there was also a very lovely waitress who we also liked a lot). This place, this food, and these people at OFF THE HOOK are the REAL DEAL!!!!!!! If you're looking for a no-frills restaurant with GREAT fish and chips (they had some fish tacos and a fish wrap on the menu that sounded delicious that I'd love to try next time!), large portions, and the nicest people around... you'll love it here. I sure did."}
{"text":"This place is Yummy, Clean n Cooked to Perfection. The staff is friendly n pretty fast.  This is the spot for some bomb Fish n Seafood...... YUMMMMMMMMMY"}
{"text":"We ordered through a delivery system and had some issues with items left out. I called and talked with an a manager or owner and he refunded missing parts quickly. Fish is hand battered and catfish bites very good."}
{"text":"Service is great. I believe the only person there was the owner. Place doesn't seem quite busy enough to need or support more staff.  Fish and chips is what I ordered and was spot on. Large pieces of fish. Fish is fresh and flaky, not just a bunch of batter and thin fish. Batter is thin and super crispy. Best fish and chips in town by far.  You are going to pay for it though. Seems a bit high in price, my guess is to support slow business and expensive fish. If you mention Yelp they give you an extra price of fish if you order 3 pieces or more. Definitely large enough to split if you get 3 pieces and 1 free.  Will go back, hope they stay busy enough to survive..."}
{"text":"Went to this place a couple months ago and had the 'lobster' roll. Let me tell you, I grew up in Massachusetts and it was NOT lobster, it was the imitation crab crap. Because I have social anxiety, I just ate it and didn't complain at the time, but reading these reviews, I should have complained. It was even still in the 'rolls' and I could uncoil it. My son's fish and chips was 'okay' but not great. It was very greasy.   I, for sure, won't be back."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place just because it looked good and it was.   I had the four piece fish and the wife had a two piece.  Absolutely delicious. The place is also very clean, and a very friendly staffer, Angelo.  We will definitely be back when fish fry calls again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little fish and chips fast food place. Sweet, polite, and efficient waitress/cashier. Only one dish not deep fried: the mahi tacos, but the fish is skimpy and the price a little high for the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time today!  It was so delicious, had the 2 piece fish and chip and miraculously to my delight there was a 3rd piece thrown it.  The cod was so fresh and meaty.  Can't wait to go back and try the calamari."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! The atmosphere at most of these strip mall places kind of sucks in Vegas . But , some of em still are worth checking out - Off the Hook is a great fish fry joint . Fish tacos were really awesome , haddock fish fry is great . Slaw and fries are top notch too . Fun , very inexpensive food"}
{"text":"Love this place for fish and chips and great clam chowder!!! Customer service is always great and we've never been dissatisfied with our food."}
{"text":"I have been searching for decent fish and chips in Las Vegas for years. We have been to Off The Hook 4 times and it is the BEST fish and chips in town. The fact that it is close enough to our house to walk over is another big plus. The fish is GREAT - light crispy breading and white, clean YUMMY fish - none of the dark, off putting spots inside. I prefer skinny crispy fries but this place has me sold on their larger delicious fries. We got the 2-piece fish and chip dinner the 1st time and were taken back by the price ($13 each) but it was too much food. We now order the 1-piece ($8) and it fills us up. One suggestion for improvement - add a quality clam chowder to the menu for the perfect Fish & Chips experience. Really hoping this place makes it because it is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I got the combination plate with the 2 pieces of cod, 2 shrimp, and 2 oysters. Everything was really good. Excellent dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried it based on Yelp reviews.  Really enjoyed the scallops and the Cajun shrimp. Nice fries.  Stuffed at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"We got the six piece to split.... I did not hold my end at all. I could only put away two of those big boys. The fish as great. The delivery guy was friendly. It's a good night for sure. I think I read a review in Grubhub that someone said the portion wasn't that big...... Glad I didn't listen to that guy"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this fish for a long time, and finally got around to it tonight.  My grandmother used to make fish and chips that were amazing. Over the years I've been dissatisfied with almost every battered fish I've tried. This tasted just like hers. Served hot and crispy, it was fantastic. Fish pieces are a good size, coke slaw was good, fries nothing out of ordinary, but still good. Atmosphere is very casual. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I had the calamari as an appetizer and the fish and chips. The fish is real big pieces of real fish perfectly breaded and fried and not overly salty like many places. The fries are really good too and the give you a very generous portion. Great with the vinegar and tartar sauce. Go see Robert and Angelo, you'll be glad you did!!!"}
{"text":"New England votes YES!  Got the fried cod a la carte- some of the best I've had. $3.99 for an very good sized portion.   And the grilled mahi fish taco- always looking for places to get a la carte fish tacos. This one was solid. Fresh pico, cabbage, big hunks of fish. Only thing I didn't love was the sauce, which was a sweet Asian inspired situation. But it was light on the sauce w more on the side so I just got many sides of tartar and put it on everything.   The real call will be on the lobster roll- will update when I get around to trying one of those."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after confirming they use gluten free batter and we had a very enjoyable meal.  We had the cod and fries.  Everything was perfectly fried, the coleslaw was creamy and crisp.  Service was friendly and efficient.  We'll be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Being from New York, I am ALWAYS in search of a good fish fry. I think that I have found it!  This cute little place serves wonderfully fresh Fish and Chips!  The cod was fresh and crispy. The ample amount of chips (fries) were very tasty. The cole slaw was nice and crunchy.  I recommend Off The Hook! Kudos to a refreshing spot that cures my deepest fish desires!!!  Tell Dan that Rhonda sent you!  There is also a Check-in offer!  I'm trying to add my pics!!! Mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"The come slaw was the only thing good. Fish was greasy and some of my party for sick. D ONT recommend"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty seafood. Be sure to get your fries with Cajun seasoning! Fast and friendly service as well. Quite a find for the LV area."}
{"text":"Delicious. It's a little pricey but for the portions and quality I would say you get your money's worth. The pickiest of our group got the prawns and by the end of lunch said, \"Yup, we definitely have to come back.\". Two of us got the 2-piece fish and really enjoyed it. The owner(I can only assume that's who served us) was a great guy. Joking with customers and when talking about his Tuesday catfish he really seemed to care about the product he sold as he only buys fresh not frozen. I was too full for desert but next time we go I will definitely be trying the fried cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to get fish and chips in Las Vegas or anywhere I've been for that matter! We couldn't of asked for better customer service. When we got the food it looked exactly like it did in the picture and tasted even better! Portions were very generous as well. Not to mention the place was very clean which is always nice. We'll definitely be going again very soon!"}
{"text":"Off the hook the bomb hmmmmm so good Lobster roll delicious coleslaws seems fresh good ice water"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because of the reviews. Sadly there was a long black hair wrapped around my fish in the taco. The guy working felt bad but didn't refund my money when I said I didn't want another one"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here about once a week. The skipper's meal is my favorite, the prawns and scallops really add to the already great flavors of the cod and fries. The sauces are excellent and home made here, definitely try the Thai sauce along with the classics. I'm not an expert on coleslaw by any means but so far the slaw I've had here is my favorite.   The price is not low by any means, but the quality here is the highest I have had in fish & chips, and to me it's more than worth it. Not to mention the friendly service, Dan is the best!"}
{"text":"Real Fish and Chips and a super Lobster Sandwich Roll! I use Door Dash to get food but it always arrives hot and good just as if I ate there. The scallops and coleslaw are also exceptional!"}
{"text":"I just moved out here and I wanted to explore new places to eat. I found this place, ordered 2 fish and chips and one shrimp (the shrimp was 1.99). When we got home we ate the food and it was good but we noticed the shrimp wasn't included so we called and asked about it so maybe we can go pick one up because we wanted to try it. The lady who answers puts a manager on the phone I guess and he goes \"that's not true I put it in there myself.\" Ummmm why would I lie about a 2$ shrimp? I just wanted to try your food. Anyway, he was very nasty from there and told us we can't have another shrimp but we can get our money back. Very ridiculous way to treat a first time customer. If I wanted to lie and get over on them I think I can come up with something better than a missing 2$ shrimp. Smh. Won't be bac"}
{"text":"I bought the groupon prior to visiting Las Vegas, we like to try restaurants off the beat and path when we travel...  we ordered the catfish, hushpuppies and fries.... the catfish was very fresh, seasoned well and had a wonderful light cornmeal batter...  The food came out within 10-15min and was piping hot, which I liked...  The customer service was excellent also....We will definitely stop here again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"We had lunch at OTH today, what a nice surprise. The restaurants reviews on YELP were right on. Nice folks, and atmosphere, and the food was great... we are always looking for a good seafood location when our daughter, who is allergic to shellfish , is not eating with us... So, Today's find is a keeper, as my intended pun. Plenty of food that is as fresh tasting as we could find in the Las Vegas desert   ... Try it for yourself, you will not be dissatisfied... VM"}
{"text":"Yummy Fried Scallops a must, made to order coleslaw, Cajun Prawns, of course Cod, crispy fries, you must come through & be caught by the hook!"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times and always a delight.  The breading is light and taste the fries are just devine. Coleslaw is different in a very good way. All and all the best place for fish and chips and more."}
{"text":"Check out their vegan menu. It's amazing and they are so active on vegan groups in town and they have some of the best \"fast\" vegan food I have ever had. My Omni roommates love their reg fish and chips too    Added. I guess the original owners left and the new people are extremely slow and unorganized. That's not a major issue they are still working out the kinks. However they were playing religious music the whole 20 min I have to wait. Not everyone is religious and many of us have negative associations with that. If I have to wait 20 min for some food I don't wanna head Jesus bible music"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST fish n chips in Las Vegas..I've been here several times and its consistently good..the batter is light and crisp and the fish is always fresh and tasty... The owner is a great guy.friendly, and truly cares about his restaurant... If you're hungry, GO NOW!!"}
{"text":"This is really 4.5. Just had food delivered and the grilled mahi tacos were amazing!! Fish n chips excellent too. Want to go in person soon."}
{"text":"$4 for 3 fish tacos!!! What's not to like!! Best fish taco I've had!!  Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Delicious, non greasy cod fish & chips!  Really good mahi tacos as well. Make sure you come and eat here - it is worth it!  Friendly staff and very clean restaurant!  We will be back for the Fri/Sat only clam chowder!"}
{"text":"Lived in England for two years and the fish and chips here are the closest I've found in Vegas to the British version I used to love.  Their plan is to open three more in town,  I hope they do!"}
{"text":"Yay!! Finally a great fish and chip place in Vegas. The cod is just perfect: white, flakey, juicy...yum. The batter is crisp and delicious. Fries are standard. The homemade coleslaw is amazing...really a great addition to the plate. The house made tartar is good too...not a traditional tartar, but great for dipping and for the fries too. The portions are ridiculous...so much food! I saw one of the deserts, but I was too full to try one. I'll be back for some of that deep fried cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Better than Florida!  Seafood in a strip mall made me nervous, but no fear here.  Only thing missing is the ocean.  I am a frequent flier here and love it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster rolls and was quite disappointed that the lobster roll was actually an IMITATION CRAB roll. I'm sure there was a little but if lobster claws in there but the flavor was drowned out by the imitation crab.  Had they used all lobster meat the roll would've tasted amazing.  The fried shrimp was very good and was a good size for the price. Everyone's review for the Coleslaw was spot on       Glad we had a coupon."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place and awesome service!!! I got the fish wrap and it was so delicious, I even took my daughter back later in the day to eat there a second time, the same day. Lol a hidden treasure for sure!"}
{"text":"The portion of chips was very small. About the size of a medium McDonalds fries. The chips were also plain frozen French fried, fried. They tasted good. There was just so few of them."}
{"text":"Tried this place today based on the great reviews unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with the quality of food and service of staff. NONE of the food is fresh, EVERYTHING is frozen. The grease was old so the fish and appetizers were very dark. The dining space is very small. From what I saw there is no serving staff. - the cooks seem operate both front and back of the house. - that being said, they weren't very personalable and acted as we inconvenienced them by asking for things such as extra napkins or a different drink because there was a BUG in my cup! I have zero tolerance for poor customer service, you 100% picked the position you're in. This is one place I'll never return and advise anyone looking for a good fish and chip spot to keep searching!"}
{"text":"We have noticed all the great reviews on Yelp and decided to try this restaurant.  It was a huge disappointment.  Overpriced and underwhelming.  It's just a glorified take out restaurant with aspirations of a nice dine in restaurant.    The cod was bland and so was the coleslaw.  The tarter sauce and cocktail sauce came out of a jar and the hush puppies tasted like the frozen ones out of a bag from the grocery store.  Very unimpressive.  I will say that the restaurant did look clean and the food was super hot when brought to the table.  That is not enough of a reason to go back there, though."}
{"text":"Very good food quality. Highly recommended this place  I love grill mahi mahi tacos  The atmosphere very friendly and great service"}
{"text":"Literally off the hook. Can't get enough of this mahi-mahi fries! I love how spicy and fresh they are. If you enjoy fried fish and other sea creatures it's the place to eat"}
{"text":"Soo good and the staff are friendly definitely will be recommend this place for fish cravings"}
{"text":"Place is clean,service is great food is bland and quite greasy,the onion rings were over cooked the fries were soggy the fish had no flavor and oily I laid the fish on a knapkin and it left a substantial greasy outline on the knapkin.Not much better than my first visit."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from east coast friends! They raved about the fish being great.  We ordered calamari to start which was ok.  We each got the skipper, which was all AMAZING!!! The cod fish was perfect, the shrimp was unique and really good. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Definitely order the hush puppies.  The garlic sauce was awesome. Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I love a good pun, and I really wanted to love this place- but if the other reviews stating that the fish and chips here are \"just like England!\" are true, I'm a little bummed. Service was polite enough, and the menu is mostly fried items (including desserts).  Opted for fish and chips on my visit- their specialty. The pieces of cod used were of good quality, and the fry was good. But the batter was bland and tasteless. Good crispness, and not too thick, but no seasoning. Chips were generic fries found frequently elsewhere- not sure what I was expecting but was underwhelmed. I will say that the tartar sauce was a homemade ranch dressing?-  smooth for dipping instead of chunky and light on flavor, but most definitely NOT tartar sauce. WTH? Interested in trying their fish tacos, hoping they add a chowder to the menu.  Felt this place was a bit heavy on prices: meals from 1-5 pieces range from $8 to almost $30, with apps like onion rings (1/3 pound?) and fried zucchini going for $7 and cajun prawns for just under $10. I didn't feel that the quality was yet up enough to justify the prices."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Off The Hook since it opened. Everything was first class - great cod - perfectly cooked - good coleslaw - great tartar sauce - great service. We were there on Friday night and it was obvious there are new owners. Tables not bussed - coleslaw had NO dressing - just cabbage - fries undercooked - cod was not cooked but batter was over cooked and very dark. Pretty sure the oil was too hot. Finally another person came out to the front to help and things improved in front. We'll wait a while and try it again but if they don't have their act together that will be the last time."}
{"text":"Huge fan of their clam chowder which is all I ever order there. It's literally the best clam chowder in all of Vegas!!!  However, they stopped serving it during the summer. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!! And make it available every day, not just Fridays and Saturdays!!! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE."}
{"text":"Came here with our girls without knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the scallops and cod are. Excellent quality fish that is fried up beautifully which my 5 year old loudly acclaimed to be \"awesome\".  Friendly service , overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed... We went there because people on my celiac support group raved about the delicious food, and they use gluten free batter and separate fryers. My husband and I both had the fish and chips. I ate about half and took the rest home. I started feeling ill right away. I tested the the fish and the condiments with my NIMA (gluten sensor) and found gluten in everything. The food wasn't cheap it ran about $50 for two meals. and I found the restaurant to be very dirty. won't go back there... :("}
{"text":"YUM. We stopped by with a Groupon, and we are so glad we did! We each got the Pollock special, which was a ton of food for $12 each. Perfectly cooked fish, delicious coleslaw and fries, and the tarter sauce was great. The service was also really good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really \"Off the Hook\" lol My husband was craving fish tacos so I found this place and it was SO good!!! They had a special of 3 fish tacos for only $3.99 that's an amazing price and they were so good!! We also tried the fish and chips and lobster roll - all amazing!! Just like what you would find along the coast. Can't wait to go back!! Oh..on top of the food being good, the service went right along with that, great service!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the Mahi Mahi taco was great as were the hush puppies . I like the sauce on the tacos and the catfish breading"}
{"text":"Very nice.  I had the fish and chips and Cajun shrimp. Both were quite good. The  portions were excellent.  I could use a little lighter touch with the batter -  particularly on the shrimp and prefer a sweeter thicker tarter sauce. The fries were tasty but nothing special.  The negatives are minimal.  The price is right.  I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"I usually get there Two piece fried fish, nice serving size for me very tasty. A little disappointed that they've gone up in price, which will prevent me from stopping by as often."}
{"text":"I give the freshness of their food 5 stars however the flavor was bland. I know when preparing food for public consumption, restaurants have to go light on seasonings to appeal to the masses and not shun away anyone who may need to limit their great flavor intake due to dietary needs. But DANG not even a hint of (onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, salt....anything) flavor. Wow $18 for perfectly fried freshness w/out flavor. All the positive reviews I just knew this was gonna be great. Guess I'll just continue to fry my own (w/onion powder, garlic powder, a lil salt & some pepper) I do love to cook."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from my sister & bro in law, I knew I needed to check out Off the Hook.  Ordered:  Regular fish & chips ($8.99):- served piping hot, large portions of crispy cod (2 pieces), fries, and cole slaw Lobster roll with fries & slaw ($11.99) &Lobster roll al a carte ($7.99): lobster and crab seafood salad was well portioned and priced  Arnold Palmer ($2): Supposed to be half ice tea & half lemonade...was very watery- could not taste either flavor   Service was a tad slow: server doubled as the cashier as well. Brought our drinks up to the counter for refill  Seating: ample seating for couples, several tables available for groups of 4.   Overall: A solid choice for fresh, hot, and affordable seafood in the Spring Valley area. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Terrific place! We come here almost every weekend. Saturday afternoons are the best, since Dan is cooking and it is not super busy. Skipper is very good for 21$ but fish tacos and cod burger are a terrific lower- price alternative (12$). Service is good, and if you happen to dislike something, let them know- they will be glad to fix it. They accidentally left mayo on my girlfriends sandwich. We were just going to swap meals with her, but they checked in on us, saw the mayo, and insisted on remaking the sandwich. Great service and tasty food- I am so glad that we found this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I highly recommend it. The service is great, fish and chips are tasty and don't even get me started on the deep fried oreos! Best fish and chips in town. Well worth the drive from the other side of town."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable! Food was just okay, it wasn't anything special. Fish was cooked well but the flavor was bland and boring."}
{"text":"I am very, very picky about the fish I eat.  Especially breaded fish...OMG this was off the hook! (intended).  I highly recommend and will be visiting a lot in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent fish, excellent! Not greasy, fresh, and clean tasting. It is great if you are in the mood for fish and chips. Cannot comment on the other food items.  Minus one star for slow and not so friendly service. Still worth it though.   Solid!"}
{"text":"Sorry not a fan!! We ordered some food from here and it was very unappetizing tasted very old! I got the vegan pizza it was awful! I wouldn't recommend this is place if you're a vegan."}
{"text":"The lobster roll sandwich is the best in town. Fast, friendly, clean, and delicious. Definitely will visit again"}
{"text":"Had the catfish app and the Fish & Chips. The catfish was actually the real winner here! Very flavorful, and I loved the breading.  The Fish & Chips though was sort of mediocre, in comparison to some other Vegas spots. I'd be interested in coming back to try other menu items though."}
{"text":"Small place. Clean.  Ordered the catfish off the daily special menu. Southern style fried catfish came with cajun fries and cole slaw. also had 2 pieces of cod fish.  The catfish was excellent.  Tender and tasty.  Cajun fries were pretty good since I ate all of it.  The cod was disappointing. Over cooked. Came back two day later to try the white fish. It cost less than half of the cod and much better.  Food came out fast.  Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I asked our friends for recommendations for good fish & chips here in Vegas.  We got quite a few recommendations including one for Off The Hook Fish N Chips. A small place in a strip mall with only eight tables, I was excited from the get go. I love little hole in the wall places.  We have tried a couple of the others on the list and they had good fish & chips but so far these are the best!  We got a four piece of the Alaskan Cod to share. Nice large pieces of flaky fish with just the right amount of batter. We also ordered the hush puppies. I'm not a big hush puppy fan but my girlfriend from Tennessee is. We both thought they were the best we've had. Along with the fish, the fries and coleslaw are also very good. One thing I wish they had was some clam chowder.  Definitely some of the best fish & chips in Vegas! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow!! So happy to have found this place because I have been searching for good fish and chips in Vegas forever and finally found it. This place is excellent! Super fresh fish and chips at a fair price."}
{"text":"Had loved going to this place for the longest time but had a really frustrating experience today. We called to make a pick up order and were put on hold for over 20 minutes. We decided to hang up and call again. Next five minutes the line was busy, no big deal. We finally get a hold of someone again and tell them we will be there at a specific time. They tell us they only have enough batter for one order of dessert. Another thing that would not be a big deal if everything else had gone right. We arrive and have to wait another 15 minutes for our food. Once we got home we found out we weren't given any sauce at all for our vegan fish and chips. It is such a shame that such amazing food is paired with such poor customer service."}
{"text":"Off The Hook!!! It's just a small place not very many bells and whistles, conveniently located on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo. We ordered Loaded Mahi Fries and fried oysters and of course Wild Caught Alaskan Cod and chips. The coleslaw is really really good creamy and sweet and tangy. We will definitely be back to try all of the different appetizers they have. It's been awhile since I had sweet tea that delicious."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips in las vegas. We had the family meal and there was soooo much food.  Shrimp and scallops were so tasty. The fish and chips....well...the best!!! The server was very friendly and very quick to get our drinks and food to us. The food was perfect. For an extra treat, the deep friend oreos are great but make sure you save room for them. The portion sizes here are huge."}
{"text":"On Friday they had a special all-you-can-eat fish and chips for $10. The food was piping hot. I did find it to be on the bland side, needing a lot of salt. The fish was very crispy. Overall a good meal."}
{"text":"Omg that was the best fish and chips I've had in years. And the deep fried cheese cake omg better than sex. Will make the drive from the north west again for sure"}
{"text":"Shiver me timbers!!! Cause Cap'N Dan has some quality fish that not even Skrillex himself could put a hook on! Ultra fresh cod with a quality flakey beer batter!! The wife says the slaw was superb; crunchy sweet & light plus the prawns are on point to compliment the fish - along with 'house made' cocktail sauce so good that it should be bottled for sale!! Quick friendly service & well worth the price."}
{"text":"Really good fun food and the new vegan menu has made this my go-to place when I'm on that side  of town."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Was craving some fish and chips and looked in Yelp and found this place. Love the name first off. Very clever.   We ordered the food from a delivery service site. They said it would be about 45 minutes but man was the service fast. Not only that but they included all the extras... forks, napkins, limes, ketchup , tarter sauce, etc.  We got two orders of the fish and chips and it did not disappoint. At first we had been debating if 2 would be enough but they are huge pieces. And so filling. The fish was nice and crispy and brown in the outside, and pure white and soft on the inside. It couldn't have tasted any better.  We got an order of the Mahi Mahi Tacos to share. My husband loves these. The Mahi Mahi was delicious, it broke apart so easily. But I don't care for their sauce. It's a kind of spicy weird sauce . I don't think it taste good so unfortunately unless they change it I'll have to pass on the tacos in the future.  Super excited we found this place and can't wait to order from here again!!"}
{"text":"I had seen this recommended by Vegans Baby, and everything I expected, yes, it WAS OFF THE HOOK! Vegan fish tacos, fried zucchini...whoa! The vegan ranch is delicious! Even the salad that came with the meal had a unique dressing that was so flavorful! I really enjoyed it! Never had vegan \"fish\", and I'm glad this was my first time trying it here. Could've fooled me! Just work a little on tending the customer a little more...refills, etc. Other than that, I will return! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent place for fish and chips . Great service and food portions are huge . We had the 6 piece platter and had plenty left over for the three of us . Will defiantly be back ."}
{"text":"Best fish n chips in Las Vegas. The batter they use is absolutely amazing . The fish is a good size and the prices aren't too high. Would recommend this place to everyone and the staff is great! Place is extremely clean which is a must for me."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. I felt like I was on dirty dining. As soon as we walked in I was hearing and feeling my feet stick to the floor. The cups were dirty that we were drinking from. Asked for lemons he brings 3 out on a napkin. We ordered fish and chips and the Mahi tacos. My daughters tarter sauce had something brown at the bottom of it. My tortillas were cold and not warmed up. Go to use the ketchup with my fries and the ketchup bottle not full and nothing but  watery liquid came out. The tapatio sauces were not the usual bright red it was dark and more brownish. Where I was sitting I could see in the back the cook was not wearing gloves no hair net either. I guess I should've been happy a baseball  cap was on instead. Soda machines out of order they had other liquids in pitchers sitting on the counter. The back of the kitchen dirty and unorganized. Asked for ranch theres 3 of us he brings out 1. Got the fried oreos and it tasted like the grease from the fish. At Smith's theres a coupon that has a buy 1 get 1 meal and 50% off the desserts and it's not being honored any more. There is no Grade from health department posted anywhere on what this restaurant is supposed to be. Daughter used restroom and no paper towels. So needless to say never coming back here. I wasted my time and $35 for nothing."}
{"text":"REALLY good fish, shrimp, hush puppies & fries. Make sure to upgrade your fish to cod...well worth the extra couple of bucks. Everything was really good, and priced fairly. Hard to find fish & chips of this quality at ANY price. A+"}
{"text":"Very clean...mixed crowd! Ambiance is cool...Nice customer service very friendly and the prices are very affordable! They also have desserts! Just wish they had Sourdough for sandwiches as option!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed the first time I went back and took friends.  If you haven't been, then just imagine that you really want GREAT fish & chips ...and what it should look like, taste like, and smell like ....imagine all that in a neat, clean and nice restaurant and you're \"here\"!!!  The total menu is for the total fish-lovers palette.   Woohoo, indeed."}
{"text":"This place was really wonderful. Such a change from the standard restaurant in Vegas. The owner was there and he made you feel like he actually cared about what you ordered and whether you would enjoy it. I would recommend this establishment to everyone. It was delicious and great quality food that was cooked with care. I will be back to try the clam chowder that I read so much about,and the fish wrap. Thank you so much for being so great, Dan!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Fish & Chips, asked YELP, and headed out to Off the Hook.  I read a lot of their reviews, and looked a lot of the pictures.  Didn't prepare me for the distinct corn/cornmeal taste in the batter on our cod.  Is that normal?  If so, then it's not for me (I don't even like corn tortillas) - I never had battered fish taste like that.  The fish (cod) was fantastic!  I think the fries seemed a bit underdone.  The young girl that served us was super nice - fast, efficient, and friendly (hard to find all 3 qualities these days!). Food came out fast and was fresh."}
{"text":"Finally tried this little joint...... lemme tell yah this fish is the bees knees. The fish is tender and breading is crisp without being too oily. Tartar sauce was on point and classic in taste, exactly the way I personally like it (relish inside is the only way to go). My gf had a deep fried cheese cake which was just honestly fantastic. Great place to go when you want some QUALITY fried food."}
{"text":"I have heard of this place for a while now and last weekend we decided to try it out. Since I moved to Vegas I have not found a place with good fish and chips, they cheap out on the fish they use or the batter does not have many spices in it so they taste bland. Not this place, you have the option of the el chepo fish or the premium which is cod. Spend the extra money and go for the Cod. The batter has the right amount of spices. My wife and I split an order of 4 pieces which was just enough for both of us, she also ordered the key lime pie for desert. We took that home- the pie was just average-skip it.  I did enjoy my lunch here, the only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is the ambiance of the restaurant itself, its great for fast lunch but I wouldn't take out of town guests here for say dinner, they need to try and upgrade that a bit. Also the strip mall its in doesn't feel all that safe-OK during the day but I think nighttime would have a totally different feel."}
{"text":"Ive seen this place tons of times but never went there i must say iam a believer i had the 2piece fish with 3 shrimp an fries fried very well an crispy i wish i would hav came here b4 well worth the price"}
{"text":"Hubs & I went to \"Off the Hook\" tonight for dinner. Out of full disclosure, I'll admit, I am NOT a fan of the fish. My Husband however is British, born & bred so, I've got to indulge his native cravings every once in awhile. We've tried every fish-n-chip and British establishment in Vegas. Really, our quest is solely for fish-n-chips. I was excited to find such a highly rated NEW fish-n-chip joint in my neighborhood. Tonight felt like the night so, off we went...   Location/Ambiance; The restaurant is ingeniously tucked into a shopping mall that includes two HIGHLY rated Yelp restaurants; Baby Stacks & KoMex. The outdoor sign is temporary as, this is a new restaurant starting up. The inside is very clean, chairs & tables new & comfortable. Bathroom was spotless.   Service; The owner was the guy-next-door kinda fella. Just a really nice, friendly sorta guy.   Food; Both Hubs & I got the fish-n-chips- to go. OH.MY.GOSH. This is GOOO-oood! I got a (homemade) tangy tarter sauce that was sooo flavorful & amazing! The cod tasted fresh & had a firm flaky texture. The breading was light & crispy. My Brit Husband, whom has lived in Vegas over 21 years said; \"Best Fish-n-chips I've ever had in Vegas\". That's saying a lot. The chips were crisp & tasty. The coleslaw.... Ehhhh. It's was ok. We read through the menu planning our next trip. He's got fish sandwiches AND Deep fried desserts of all kinds; Oreo's, Twinkies, candy bars, cheesecake. I've never tried, but always wondered. Maybe some day when I'm weak.     :-)"}
{"text":"I've been searching for years to find a fish n chip place in Vegas that's as good and fresh as Ive had in Maui and Florida and I FOUND IT HERE! I'm very impressed by the owners 1 man operation. Will definitely be back !!!!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips love the malted vinegar great tartar sauce my buddy had the fish tacos all-around good no complaints will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered our food to be delivered. Came in a timely manner.  We had the calamari which was ok, probably needed to be cooked a little longer along with the hush puppies. Which that sauce is indeed amazing!  The lobster rolls were good, loved the bread. The coleslaw was good, fries were soggy but prob because it was delivered.. The fish and chips meal was delicious.  Next time we will come in and try everything fresh and not delivered."}
{"text":"I should have sorted the reviews by date before trying this place based on the overall star rating.  Maybe it used to be great, but now it is run-down/a little dirty, and the food is not good.  In particular, the fish had a very heavy batter and was soggy/greasy - maybe fried at the wrong temperature?   I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"The BEST fish and chips on the west coast.   Yes, in Las Vegas.  Really, you have to eat here.   The fish tacos are really good, also."}
{"text":"This place has some quality fish and huge in size.  I would come back for it. I asked if I can get Cajun fries instead and he said they can do that.  Next thing I was charged extra $.50. Wouldn't have minded if it was good, but it was simply a shake of Cajun salt on top, nothing really fancy.  Also, wished I would have been told that an extra charge would of incurred."}
{"text":"Yum! We have heard it was good and it was! Best fish and chips we have had so far in Vegas.  We loved the Blackened Mahi fries.  We will be back.  Did I say Yum!?!?"}
{"text":"I'd like to start this off by talking about the fried cheesecake  SO GOOD!! It was cooked perfectly and served with vanilla ice-cream and we chose raspberry syrup as our topping. I'd definitely go back just for this! We tried the fish n chips since I read how great they are, they were okay, nothing to rave about. Next time I will try the fish tacos. We also found out that they only serve Boston Clam Chowder on Friday and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Great place! Big portions friendly atmosphere it's right next to other well known places like baby stacks and Hikari.. It's a must to stop here!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I LOVED this place! I am Australian and grew up eating fish and chips and I never thought I would find some this good living in Las Vegas. We are hooked and new regulars of this place. The fish was so fresh and perfectly battered, the chips were great! Love love love"}
{"text":"Food was good. Found this little hidden gem. Great fried fish, scallops, hush puppies, and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Omg! So yummy! I got the fish and chips with Cajun fries. The Cajun fries were my favorite.  Okay, so the fish. You can taste the freshness. I have to say it was probably the best fish and chips I've ever had. It paired very well with the tartar sauce (homemade)   It's a fair price for the portion and the quality. I will definitely be back!  Oh and the owner is very, very sweet. You can tell he's passionate about his food and his customers. Definitely a pleasant experience!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance after a not a great first impression. I ordered a skipper, a combination plate. They apparently forgot about my order as it took 50 minutes to come out. While I sat there with time to be a little bit irritated, I also noticed that I was overcharged about $4 for my meal. When I was going to mention something about it, they came out and gave me a card worth $14 for my next visit. I decided not to bring it up.  A few weeks later, I decided to use my card. I ordered the same skipper combination plate with a fried zucchini appetizer. The guy inadvertantly (I hope, one doesn't want to think it could be intentional) tried to give me the wrong change (would have shorted me about $1). I pointed it out and moved on... Well my food came up and I took it and went home to eat. After I got into my combination plate, it didn't have the oysters or the jumbo shrimp, only fish and fries.  This place appears to be run in a complete incompetent manner.  I won't be back for their decent, but not great food."}
{"text":"VEGAN FISH & CHIPS ARE BANGIN'. Seriously, they are NOT *tofu* or just Gardein or something you can get at home. They taste like somebody put some love into it. The breading is amazing. Plus, you get Vegan ranch, tartar sauce & coleslaw. We will definitely be back. My only complaint is no beer to accompany my fish & chips, because it's quintessential bar food!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.  I was impressed by the reviews and was excited to try!  Fish and chips was on our minds.    This place is located on flamingo and buffalo.  Tip* check in with yelp and receive 15% off your entire check.  It's a small shop with cute sea decor.  It was a pretty busy night.  As people arrived people left which was nice because we didn't have to wait for a table.    This place gets a 4 stars because their customer service deserves a 5 star.  The staff was really nice and helpful in explaining the menu.  The service was excellent!  The food came out quick and hot.    I really wanted to enjoy my meal.  There was no taste at all.  I had to add salt to my meal.  It could be that they had a new chef that night.   We got the mushrooms to start off with.  I ordered the combo with the oyster, shrimp, fish, and fries.  The food was cooked perfectly but the lack of flavor had me disappointed and dissatisfied.  It's a shame because I really wanted to love this place.  I will be back to give it another try!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place we finally caved in and went.   I ordered the vegan fish and chips and I was very pleased. My husband ordered the vegan marinara sandwich and he thought it was amazing.   We both left satisfied and stuffed. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Customer service was outstanding! Very attentive and accommodating.  I ordered the 3 piece fish and chips. The fries were seasoned to perfection with Cajun seasoning. Fish was golden and crispy on the outside and white and flakey on the inside.   The coleslaw was an awesome compliment to the fried food.   The real stars of this meal were the delicious Cajun prawns and the delicious dipping sauces of cocktail and tar tar sauce. When paired together it was fantastic.   I would defiantly recommend this to all friends and family."}
{"text":"Lobster/Crab Roll disappears in seconds...lotsa meat. Premium Fish thick Cod Filets   Very Friendly Staff!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing & their portion was pretty generous. The fried cheesecake was divine! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I am always fair and truthful. Good is good and bad is bad.  The new owner (3rd owner since the place was opened several years ago) is the worst ever.  He  appears to have little respect for American health standards. The place has taken on a dirty tint from lack of cleaning. I visited several weeks ago, saw some issues that did not comply with county and state health regulations.  I reasoned that this would work itself out. A board has now been placed to block the view of the kitchen. Good solution? On my most resent visit I noticed that there is no CCHD inspection certificate posted as to A, B, C,  rate by the inspector.  I made an inquiry as to why, the owner came out of kitchen and stated that he is still waiting for a certificate and said the inspector was there and removed the A certificate of the previous owner.  I had my two piece wild caught cod in my had before my questions.  This was 13.99.  Fine no problem. This was the most dry fish ever and the fries were soggy, the very small cup of coleslaw was warm and all was tossed out .  There is something fishy going on there and its not the smell of old fish. Will not ever be back."}
{"text":"When it comes to eating Fish n Chips I take it seriously. There are so many factors in Fish n Chips. This place had it all. The options of pieces of fish range from one piece to 5. Also you can change it up with other options. The sizes of fish were perfect. The texture was light and fluffy. The breading was just right. Not to much or too little. The breading also didn't overpower the fish taste. The coleslaw was the perfect combo of sweet and tart. Not to dry or soupy. The atmosphere was quaint and simply. Nautical decor on the walls and a very cute painting on the front entrance. It's inside like a strip mall so you need to be looking for it. I think these kind of places are the best kept secrets. I bought this deal on a Groupon. I was impressed. If you don't fill up on the FIsh n Chip order some Fried Oreo's...TO DIE FOR! Definitely will be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Our favorite fish and chips place when we come to Vegas! The fish tacos are excellent too."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Didn't really expect this place to be this good honestly I lived in Australia for 7 years so they have breathtakingly crazy good fish and chips down there but by far this is the best fish and chips I've ever tried outside of Australia. You can tell its fresh made and seafood is very juicy and tender.. I'm so glad I live just cross the street from here, definitely going back regularly"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos! Will be coming back for more. I replaced the regular fish they use with a wild cod. It is fried up in a nice batter and delivered hot and crispy to the bite."}
{"text":"Just had their cod, shrimp & scallop combo.  The fish was good.  But the scallops and shrimp are amazingly delicious. The owner and server are both nice and smiley.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Vegan fish and chips are excellent. Also try the vegan fish sandwich which is equally as good. Vegan coleslaw has been the best I've had in a long time. Cute place!"}
{"text":"It was off the hook . 5 years ago and then defrosted. This place is really not worth it.  If you are starving and you need something to fill you up in that case give it a chance(you can also buy a bag of chips at Walgreens nearby). If you are looking to have nice meal then don't. The food tasted like everything was take out of the freezer and placed in hot oil. And that's it. Bags and barrels of frozen fish, French fries, deep fried placed in a paper plate and call it a restaurant. The stuff was nice so I'm giving it a extra star. At least I've been once. And definitely never to be back."}
{"text":"Best fish & chips I've had in Lad Vegas . Fish and chips , lobster roll and wife's mahi tacos were all on point and delicious . Portions are big and satisfying . Excellent prompt and friendly service . Off the hook gets the island boy seal of approval . I recommend this place to anyone and will return soon ."}
{"text":"the quality and taste of the food still has me salivating even after over 5 weeks since my last visit. dang!   had their fish tacos and cod father fish and chips with cajun fries.  BOMB.  yes, it was not cheap, but nonetheless, it was BOMB.  cannot wait to go back to vegas so that i can eat here again.  pls don't go anywhere, off the hook.  i'm coming to visit you again soon!"}
{"text":"Priced a bit high Imo to make the weekly rotation that being said it's good. Definitely the cod and chips + vinegar not the malt kind but it will do. Kinda stingy with the tartar and no lemons  to b seen on the scene. C lovers is the median where the buck and ear would be the standard FYI."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, ordered food for pick up. Very pleased with the fish and chips: it wasn't oily, the breading was crisp and didn't dominate the taste of the fish, the fish was soft and cooked perfectly, fries were great, not salty at all, and the tarter sauce was delicious. Tastes better than the fish and chips I've had at Redondo Beach. Definitely coming back when we're in town."}
{"text":"**THIS REVIEW IS FOR PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP - THEY HAVE CHANGED OWNERS SINCE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN BACK FOR A SUBSEQUENT VISIT**I recently went to a fish n chips place in Half Moon Bay (review on it's way!) and now I think I'm on a fish n chips binge. I previously tried Lazy Joe's in LV, but was a bit let down by the experience that I had just written fish n chips off in Vegas. I had remembered Off the Hook (great name, btw) was in the same plaza as some of my favorite places (Komex, Chef Zen) so I decided to pop in here for dinner with my husband.   The food here is solid. I enjoyed the flavors in my Fish Wrap, which had cod, avocado, cabbage, Thai sauce and fresh pico in a tomato-basil wrap. This will be something I'd order again and again. Their cole slaw was crunchy and refreshing and the fries were hot and crispy. My husband enjoyed the fish in his fish n chips and the cod used was very 'meaty'. He'd like to try the cajun seasoning next time for added flavor in the batter. Tartar sauce was perfectly tangy and the owner read our minds and replenished our supply when needed.   What I'm actually most impressed by is the amazing customer service from the owner. He was doing everything on his own - explaining the menu, taking orders, checking in on tables, refilling drinks, cooking, etc. At one point, there were 6 parties in the restaurant and he took care of everyone so seamlessly. It was way better service than I've gotten at a sit-down restaurant with more staff available. He never made anyone feel rushed or neglected, and he showed a lot of compassion to an elderly woman that was eating by herself and wanted to chat. It was the kind of genuine service that really leaves a positive impression on you and this is a business I'm rooting for."}
{"text":"We visited today and then checked the yelp reviews. The food was as promised fried fish. It was fine.That being said we realized after we read the reviews that you don't take kindly to recommendations. Prior reviews were correct . Items on the table needed to be clean ie ketchup, malt vinegar etc. wipe the things down with a hot cloth. Also the music does not go with the clientele. If you want a restaurant that people come to we think you need to listen and make some changes."}
{"text":"I got the Skipper Combo for $21 here, and although it is on the expensive side, I felt like this was a situation where you get what you pay for. I was full half way through my combo so maybe I should get less food next time, but even though I was full I still kept eating cause everything (Fries, shrimp, cod, scallops and coleslaw) was tasty AF.   The coleslaw was tangy and had a little kick from the black pepper. The fries were good, I used a little malt vinegar, medium crispy with a moist inside. The shrimp were really big and plump, with a little bounce when you bite into them. The scallops have the same kind of plumpness of the shrimp (little more flaky though) and has an interesting oceany flavor that scallops tend to have. The cod is very tender and flaky, although the biggest impression it left on me was how huge it was. (Also I think I came close to closing time so I got an small bonus piece along with my 2 main ones) The breading for the sea food seemed to be all the same, a light pancake like batter, little sweet and was fried perfectly.  The sauces can make of break the taste of all the awesomeness mentioned above, and I got two kinds, the red cocktail like sauce and a white tartar sauce. The red sauce was really good with a little tang and was not too salty with fruity notes. The tartar sauce is decent but i would like it to be a little thicker as it doesn't stick on to the batter that well.  I will definitely be coming here again and would like to try the desserts next time."}
{"text":"It's a little hole in the wall, just south of Walgreens at Buffalo and Flamingo but food is amazing! Fried cod is served very hot with cold tartar sauce. Coleslaw very Rich and tangy. French fries served crispy and hot. Prices are very reasonable; highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All i have to say is OMG! The best fish and chips I've had by far. The fish was delish, so crispy and tender on the inside. The hush puppies were awesome and went great with the sauce. Ive already told a bunch of friends. I will be back lol."}
{"text":"I decided to check Off the Hook out based on seeing it had a lobster roll on the menu. There were 4 tables marked \"reserved\", and I asked the restaurant associate if we could sit at one of those tables. He stated they saved those tables for larger parties.  We were given the option to sit at one of the 2 top tables.  Feeling restricted and limited to a table choice with only 2 tables in there at that time, I was about to leave but decided to give it a shot.  During the visit only one of those \"reserved\" tables was utilized.  My guest and I did order the lobster roll.  I was surprised to see on one menu it just advertised lobster roll (found on the web), also indicated on their special board it showed \"Lobster Roll\" and the menu in the restaurant indicated it was lobster AND crab. However it was probably 80% crab and 20% lobster.   I would like to state, the sandwich WAS flavorful, the fries were hot and crisp, the coleslaw was good and, the food came out in a timely fashion.  I would just probably advertise \"Seafood Roll\".."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips.   Got the 4 piece to share with my husband   Plenty of chips and Cole slaw for both.   The batter is nice and crispy.  This place is a keeper"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this little fish hide away on and off for several months.  The quality of the fish and chips has been consistently good. I almost always get the two piece cod which are large portions.  The cod is crunchy and moist.  Tastes fresh frozen, but what can you expect being far away from cod country.  You are served fries (chips) and demitasse of cole slaw with two cups of tartar sauce.  Served on a serving platter.  All for $14.  Beverages are ala carte. I got the bottled water$1.00.  The menu has many options from catfish too white fish. They also have appetizers to choose from. The ambiance is sparse with about ten tables.  They have tried to follow a nautical theme inside but that's about it. You can order take out or eat in.  The place gets busy from 11 am onward.  The tables were in need of wiping down, at least the one I sat at, and the table condiments like the malt vinegar bottle had finger prints.  Your food is brought to the table by the cashier/waiter. (Hope he washed his hands).  A guest mentioned that the business had been sold and Good Friday was their last day... Ironic that is.  I will return and see if the new owners will improve on or ruin something that was unique to the Southwest valley... Hope not!"}
{"text":"For years I have been trying to find an AUTHENTIC fish and chips restaurant, however to no avail.  That is until last night.........My grandson was celebrating his 16th birthday and the only thing he wanted for his birthday dinner was fish and chips.  I did some research and saw that Off the Hook had some great ratings........So, we made the jaunt, about 20 minutes from Henderson and we were more than amazed at the quality, the quantity, the temperature of the fish and fries, the wonderful creamy coleslaw and the deep fried oreos were over the top.  My grandson ordered the Cod Father which was an ENORMOUS amount of fish, fries and coleslaw and as a growing boy teen he finished almost all of it.  I would recommend this place to anyone that loves fresh, flaky authentic fish and hot fries without the least bit of tasting greasy.  We'll be back.......Very soon..."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night with a groupon special. We decided to share the COD FATHER special, Dan recommended the cajun seasoning for the fries n cod, and honestly this is the best fish n chips i have ever had....im sure my bf would agree with me. The fish was fried to perfection, the batter was slighlty crispy and fluffy. Oh, and i absolutely  hate tarter sauce, and i must say this place tarter sauce gets my full approval."}
{"text":"This is a kind of hole in the wall spot, but the food is great. We ordered the catfish plate and the fish and shrimp combo. Both were very good. The only knock I would give them is that on their Yelp page the menu had items that I was told that they don't sell, specifically the combo with scallops. I was told that they don't have scallops, and c'mon, what seafood joint doesn't sell fried clams?? Other than that, I would recommend them."}
{"text":"Went here after work. Had a taste for fried fish. The fish tasted real fresh and the pieces were pretty big in size. Nice crisp batter. I would return."}
{"text":"Being from Rhode Island I figure I'm a good judge of seafood ... for Las Vegas this place is just great! The owner is so nice and you can tell she really cares about the customer.   The Alaskan cod was wonderful.  Not fishy at all... the Mahi fries were the bomb!!! I recommend the Mahi fries for sure.   We ordered the onion rings as well ... wish the onion in them was thicker with less batter...   All of the vegan options are a nice plus as is the fact that the batter and buns are gluten free! :)   True to New England there is also Malt vinegar on the table.   This place serves comfort food and there is something for everyone on the menu!   We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here w/my daughter Charlotte and for starters we had vegan fried mushrooms and it was delicious! I ordered Mahi fries and Charlotte ordered vegan fish"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday, ordered the 1 piece of fish and it was huge! It tasted great....it came with fries and coleslaw ($8), I'm not a coleslaw fan so I asked if there was a substitute, there wasn't, but he was nice enough to just throw in more fries instead. I really enjoyed the food, I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Super cute place, clean and super customer service!  Fish was fresh with a light breading, fries where ok, the onion rings where very good and the coleslaw was excellent!!  Great place, great food - check it out!  #supportlocalLV."}
{"text":"fish was great..batterd just right..fish tacos were also done just right..."}
{"text":"Fish n fries were good but the taco was terrific. The breaded shrimp was bad though... Undercooked and too heavy tasting. Will come back only for mahi tacos."}
{"text":"Really good. Had fish n chips. Looked just like the picture! And tasted better. Friendly host. Clean little spot. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends are here a couple weeks ago and it's amazing! I love seafood and the wrap was absolutely perfect! Not to mention the owner (who is the only one that works there) was way cool and friendly. He asked us a few times how the food was and was very personable and makes great food. I'll be back here frequently."}
{"text":"Wife and I went today. Both had fish & chips. GREAT quality...some of the best I've ever had. Very light but firm...just the right amount of batter/crust. Not a huge coleslaw fan but theirs is as good as I've ever had. Prices caught me a little off guard -- but like the saying goes -- \"you get what you pay for\". It was very tasty. Can't wait to try the tuna melt (very fussy about my tuna melts) and the clam chowder."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were fine.  Unfortunately I ordered the lobster roll.  I asked the owner's son if it was real Maine Lobster and he answered  yes.  What it was, was 100% real fake crab!!!! They were lucky they were closed because i would have brought it back!  They must think they are in the backwoods  of the Ukraine to pull such a stunt.  I will never go back"}
{"text":"the batter was limp and soggy and so were the french fries!  I wasted an outrageous twenty dollars on this meal."}
{"text":"In the Las Vegas Valley area, Off the Hook is definitely the best fish n chips restaurant.  I no longer have to leave Las Vegas to find good fish n chips.  Friendly service.  The batter is just right and the cod tasted fresh.  Great chips. I also enjoyed the cole slaw with the creamy home made dressing. i highly recommend Off the Hook for fish n chips lovers."}
{"text":"My hubby was craving the catfish and it was ok. It's defiantly overpriced for what you get and it's taste more of a fast food like a long John silver. I wasn't to fond of it."}
{"text":"Being from New Zealand fish and chips is a dining staple that we miss.  I was looking forward to a delicious meal after reading the great reviews. I'm rating this 3 stars cause I ordered thru uber eats, it's not the restaurants fault that an 8 minute delivery took the driver 35 mins, food was cold and soggy when it arrived. If I pay $40+ for the 2 of us I expect to be blown away and unfortunately I was not.  Don't know if it was because it was the last order of the night but the quality was not very good."}
{"text":"Amazing fish, garlic fries are crazy good, coleslaw on point. Can't say enough good, food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay so I went to this place about a week ago the owner was there alone without his cook he made it so smooth and seamless and everybody would felt welcome and happy and I have been craving the Cajun prawns and that delicious coleslaw for about a week now this place is super far from where I live but I know I will be making another trip and it will be so worth it everything there is fresh and delicious the place is small but immaculately clean the owner is super friendly and super cool I hope he opens a place close to my house soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out on Saturday night. The fish was great but the onion rings were the best. We order the family size meal (pacific white fish). It came out to  $25 with tax. It could have feed three people. The only con was the coleslaw, it wasn't bad just a little bland other then that the fish was cooked nicely as well as the french fries and onion rings. Glad we splurged it was a great meal, enjoyed  with a cold beer."}
{"text":"The food here is actually really good.  But the customer service is awful.  We've eaten here before and enjoyed the food.  So we ordered our normal fish and chicken for delivery.  What we got in the chicken was half the size of the normal order. When we called to ask if if had changed we were informed they had run out of their regular chicken and this was their back -up. (They didn't contract us to let us know we were getting half the food that we purchased, just sent it. ) We hung up, and a few minutes later noticed they had also neglected to send us the tartar sauce.  We called back again, expressing our dissatisfaction that we were getting less than we had paid for,  and that we both hadn't been informed,  and the rest of our order wasn't correct.  Their response -- No offer to correct it either today or in the future.  No sincere apology.  Just a \"Well we were out of chicken and those were our last back-up pieces so you couldn't have extra.\" I've eaten here before, due to the service,  I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Decent fish tacos for Las Vegas. Hot fish and chips, but not that special for all the good ratings on here. No thanks, I'm not tasting the hype. Was okay. Thanks to the place for accepting our $8 Entertainment coupon since we came across town to try it just as they closed."}
{"text":"Very good service...very clean....expensive...no flavor or seasoning. ..must be English or Irish inspired.  No spices.  Not fishy tasting this is done very pure but bland ...... restaurant always empty. Hence the Groupon probably. Cole slaw is very good.... and bring your own Tartar sauce, there's taste  like ranch dressing...."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street so very convenient. It is nice and clean inside. Decor is cute. When I went in, it was shortly after 11am when they opened. There was a guy cooking in the back, he was the only employee but greater me right away. There was 1 customer before me. After a few minutes he gave the customer before me his to go order and then took my order. I saw on the yelp pics how large the fish was so I only ordered a 2 piece fish and chips. Again, this only took a short amount of time and were sent on our way. He put air holes in the Togo bags to release the steam. By the time I got home, my food was still hot and the fries and fish were still crispy. I like the cole slaw, it tastes fresh with a slight sweet tang, very good. The fries were awesome, cooked perfectly. And the fish? Pretty awesome too. It was actually seasoned better than any other fried cod I had before. The gentleman also told me the fish were smaller that usual that morning, so he actually gave me 4 pieces instead of 2! Great customer service! When I saw the pieces, they were a little smaller that compared to pics, but I would have been happy with 1 additional piece to ale up for size. Any fish and chip cravings in the future will be appeased by going here again. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is great for anything battered and deep fried. Its like a County Fair in here.  If you come here for lunch you may have trouble deciding where to eat between KoMex next door or Babystacks across the parking lot. You will not be disappointed if you choose Off the Hook because it does hold its own against those other two Yelp heavy weights."}
{"text":"This family owned place will surprise you .  The cod was fresh and fried to perfection , the half portion of mahi mahi fries was pretty big, delicious although a little spicy .  We came in hungry and left full and satisfied .  We will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. I'm a big fish and chip guy and they do it right. Well worth the extra to get cod it's just a better fish. Portions were on point. Will be back on Tuesday for fish tacos their 9.99 special"}
{"text":"The service is definitely 5 stars. Very attentive and friendly. The food is okay. I got the fish tacos and my mom had the fish and chips. She loved her's but I've def had better fish tacos before. It was cool to try something new though."}
{"text":"Have been eyeing them for quite some time, but they are a long way away. I finally got there, it was ok, but did not blow me away. All was served hot and fresh. The portions were good but kinda spendy. The batter needed a bit of salt, a bit bland without. My wife even added salt, which she never does!  One odd thing... Their private labeled water bottles, tasted like Las Vegas city water. (Yuk) Have never come across that before..."}
{"text":"I love reading this place actually has even more hidden excellence in the folks talking about the clam chowder on Fridays.  Ill have to plan for it now.  I wanted to write a review on the fish n chips.  Hands down the best I have ever had even living on the coast I have never found Fried cod this good.  WOW,  and it really is Off the Hook!"}
{"text":"I Love off the hook but this was a very bad experience, I ordered thru yelp for delivery, I paid for my order, I tipped well for my order and I received what I thought was my order!! When I went to open my dinner of a mahi-mahi  sandwich with fries , cole slaw, and an order of hush puppies to my surprise I had none of that in my bag!! I was given somebody else order which I didn't want or eat! After trying to reach the delivery driver or yelp for resolution with no luck I called off the hook only to be told they know about the mixup but they close soon and will not be able to make it right. So basically what I got was what I got!! Thanks Yelp and off the hook! Well as of the time I posted this my account has not been credited back my purchase. Thank you for the gesture but to come on here and say I got way more food than I paid  for and then blame it on yelps driver to make it look like I'm wrong somehow when a simple apology would have made me a content customer."}
{"text":"After 7 years searching for a restaurant that served good fish and chips in the Valley I finally found \"Off the Hook\".  Funny thing is, I found this place by coincidence.  My wife and I were having breakfast for the 1st time at Baby Stacks (across the lot)  last weekend and while waiting to be seated, I was standing outside and noticed this place.  \"Yelped\" it and saw the great reviews and ratings from other customers.  My friend and I broke away from work and went there for lunch.  Dan is personable / friendly and will make you feel right at home.  As far as the food, we ordered the fish and chips and fish tacos.  Both were excellent.  But the \"FISH AND CHIPS\"!!! were definitely \"Off the Hoooook\"!!!  The cod was as fresh as can be...nicely filleted (by Dan himself) not too thick...not to thin and cooked perfectly (not greasy) with a light, crisp and tasty batter.  It comes with tartar sauce but for me the flavor and seasoning was enough without it.  Dan please accept my personal thanks for opening this restaurant.  As mentioned, I will bring my wife on Saturday for lunch.  P.S.  I normally don't take the time to write reviews but this is a special place that warrants it!!  Mike C."}
{"text":"Not bad. It satisfied my pescatarian needs.  Oysters fried a little to long.  Seating was limited due to some tables being reserved.  Coleslaw average and tartar was too. Nothing made me want to take a picture."}
{"text":"Cute little place, tastefully decorated. Food tasted freshly made and had great flavor. Love having a clean delicious fish place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in the valley! Have tried Gordon Ramsey and most of the British pubs. To me it is worth paying a little more and getting the fresh cod. Very consistent quality and great service."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order through Amazon Restaurants. Within a few minutes of the confirmation text that my order from Amazon and the withdrawal on my checking account I received a text telling me that part of my order was cancelled. I had no idea what was going on because the amount didn't match any of the items ordered(it was less).    I immediately called the restaurant to find out what happened. The woman who answered the phone was not very pleasant. She explained that they couldn't make that item so it was voided. I was disappointed that the restaurant wouldn't even attempt to contact me to see if I was interested in substituting for something else. I guess one of the two people who intended to eat were just supposed to go hungry. Also the amount of the refund did not match the price of the item. Based on the lack of customer service and math problems on their end I decided to cancel the entire order. I told the employee that I needed to feed two people and a partial order wouldn't work.  I asked about replacing it with something for the same price (what I paid not what they refunded). She said since they already refunded that item there was nothing they could do. I told her I would be cancelling the order and needed a full (correct) refund. She hung up on me.   The refund and cancelled order was not sent to Amazon Restaurants. I waited for almost an hour (they would be closing soon) then had to contact Amazon. Amazon had no record of my cancellation. It took 30 minutes on the phone until they could confirm with the restaurant that they weren't making my food.  I was very much looking forward to trying this place but after this, I'll find somewhere else.  Addition to review because of response: this was not last night or tonight. This is just when I got around to leaving a review. The tone of your response doesn't do much to redeem the experience.  Sometimes saying nothing is better."}
{"text":"Pretty good Fish and Chips! The fried scallops and Hush Puppies are a must try! Good job Off The Hook!!"}
{"text":"Super money. Best fish and chips in Las Vegas. The clam chowder is some of the finest I have had outside of the Bay Area. Staff is really friendly and attentive. Been here twice so far and will gladly keep coming back. Get the fried Oreos!!!"}
{"text":"The batter here is the best holds up to any sauce you are want. The Mahi fries and the oysters are the best."}
{"text":"We came in here for the first time. It is a small casual place. We ordered the 3 piece fish and chips, that comes with cole slaw and fries. We asked the server if we could get the truffle fries for an upgrade instead of the regular fries that goes with the fish and chip. We repeated couple of times our order then the server said she got it. But when the order came, they were wrong, we got the 3 piece fish and chip with regular fries and also another 1 piece fish and chip we didn't order. We decided not to bother her. She was nice and friendly otherwise. Maybe she was overwhelmed that day I don't know.  After we got our food, the waitress came with someone's else's order and then realized it was for the table next to us. I ordered Coke but they gave me Diet. The Truffle fries and the regular fries were bland and distasteful. I usually don't like to rate bad experience but we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the fish and chips to go. The fish was excellent! Fries had a little too much salt but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Off. The. Hook!! I've been meaning to check this place out for a while now and I'm so glad I did on this trip home! Angelo was holding down the fort on a busy Saturday afternoon and frequently checked on our table to make sure we were good. We started with the Cape Shark tenders appetizer and it was perfectly cooked! Also ordered the Sailor platter and upgraded to Cod which is very well worth it. You will definitely leave with a full stomach and leftovers! Overall, loved how the breading was light and crispy and the quality of the fish. Great pricing for the plates that they serve. Easily the best fish and chips I've had in Las Vegas! Gotta give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place my husband and l eat here all the time!! all of the food is very good, best fish and chips lv had in a long time the home made coleslaw is very tasty, highly recommend this place See you soon!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've tried in Vegas love the catfish strips and the shrimp the batter was seasoned just right I'm a southern girl and I know good fish."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the quality of the food.  Ordered the 2 pc fish & chips, no seasoning & the breading separated from the fish.  Highly priced."}
{"text":"Off the Hook just added a whole vegan menu to there list of delicious eats! Of course, I had to check it out.   Walking into the shop reminded me much of a little British fish and chips shop, and they had everything you'd expect, except the mushy peas. It's very cosy inside and it filled up with people quite quickly.   There was so many options on the vegan menu, pizzas, burgers (with good FYH cheese) and more! But, it just happened to be friendly, which meant $9.99 AYCE vegan fish and chips was on the menu. Who could pass up on that. My table of three all opted in for this experience.   I never was a coleslaw fan, but let me tell you, this coleslaw was really good. The fries were perfectly thick and warm, and the vegan fish was really tasty. To top it all off the tartar sauce was everything I could've dreamed of.   Needless to say, we all left the place with our pants unbuttoned and our wallets felt unaffected. If you have $10 on a Friday, there's no better place to go. I can't wait to try all of the other items on their vegan menu!"}
{"text":"The food here is very fresh and tasty we were pleased that the batter they use is gluten free. We will be back and highly recommend"}
{"text":"OMG, this is delicious! This is just as good as the fish n chips in London but a heck of a lot cheaper. The staff is friendly and very happy to help. You must absolutely try the deep fried Twinkies because you have not lived until you have tasted them. They do have different items on the menu including some that are not fish related so I would definitely say anyone can eat here. This is a must do on any list of great eateries!!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced but great food - and I'm not even big on seafood.  Lobster roll was DA bomb.  Lots of little different things to choose from besides fish and chips.  Pleasantly surprised with menu selection."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot. I've never been a huge fan of fish and chips (even though I've lived in the U.K.) until i came here. My gf and I got the Premium Atlantic Cod Fish platter with Cajun fries and hushpuppies. The fish was perfectly cooked, not oily at all and the perfect amount of outer crispness. The fish inside is perfectly cooked and juicy and together with their tartar sauce and some malt vinegar, it's a match made in heaven. They definitely aren't skimpy at all with their portions, and the quality matches it.  Kudos to this place! You guys definitely know how to cook fried fish right."}
{"text":"So I was very excited to come here as this place has 4.5 Stars. I thought it would be great fish and chips that I would crave every time I came back to Vegas but Sorry Off the Hook, it's just not 4.5 Stars.  The place was clean and the service was great and very friendly, that deserves 5 stars but the fish was just not good. I should have read more reviews. Like Diana H said the fish was bland and in my case it was under cooked. I asked to have it made well done and they gracefully brought me a new platter but in my opinion it still was not well cooked. I couldn't eat it. I spent $25 on a meal I did not enjoy. They were large pieces, which is good but maybe the pieces need to be smaller before they are fried but what do I know. The coleslaw was ok but could have been better too, too much mayo. I also tried the zucchini, it was soggy. Maybe I've just had great fish in other locations and it did not compare but this is just my opinion. Feel free to come try for yourself."}
{"text":"Ive visited this place twice now and i can say for me and my mom we've found our go to spot when we have a taste for fish n chips and not to mention all the other great dishes they have on their menu. We've tried the \"lobster roll\" which was amazing and the calamari was tatsy as well. My mom tried the fish and chips and she  is very picky so when she said she liked it .. then it was probably pretty good. Oooh yeah and on our second visit we tried their catfish and that was tasty as well. We're already planning our next trip there haha to try out more of the menu. This place is definitely a must try if your looking for some good catfish or if your having a craving for some seafood."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the food tonight. The fish needs to have no flavor too it but Grease. The waiter had an attitude about the free fish the all-you-can-eat seem to give an attitude about getting us extra pieces. I probably will not go back to this place this is the third time first time was great the last two times was not to par."}
{"text":"My wife often craves fish and chips.  We have been on the hunt for many months and came accross this place. This a is a legitimate fresh fish resturant.  Reminded us of the fish and chips in England.  The owner is very nice and helpful.  We are hoooked!"}
{"text":"We had the fish-and-chips.   Delicious, perfectly cooked, steak fries were awesome.   The service was friendly.   I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Small joint but great food and fair prices. I order the premium (wild caught) fried fish n chips, wow so so good. And the fish portions were big. Highly recommend. Staff was very friendly and great"}
{"text":"The menu is kind of limited, but the cod is very high quality. Fries could be a little crispier. Garlic fries were good. I ate 3 pieces of cod and very little else because the fish was so good. Tried the cole slaw and it was very good. I just didn't have much room left because I ate so much fish. My husband had shrimp and scallops, but he still loved the cod. Next time he will probably just order the cod."}
{"text":"Had probably the best fish and chips in my life at this great place. The guy running the place was doing it single handedly and made each visitor feel special and well taken care of from start to finish. The coleslaw was heavenly! Two big thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant decor.  Very clean. Great staff.  Checked on us a couple of times to be sure we liked our food. Food was cooked when ordered. Fish was not greasy at all. Best fish and chips I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for some time, and it didn't disappoint. I ordered pick up through Yelp, which was very easy.  When I arrived, I was greeted and my good was fresh and piping hot. I ordered the two pics meal. The breading is light but very flavorful. The potions were very big. It was too much for me, but I couldn't stop eating.  I will be back to try the tacos and more! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing.  The fish is fresh,  the service is great,  and there is tons of flavor in everything.  Everything definitely lives  up to the hype."}
{"text":"I got the groupon $15 f0r $30 deal and had a lunch with my friend.  We got the 3 piece combo + yelp sign in piece, mahi mahi fish taco combo, and fried twinkies. The food took about 12 minutes to come out, and we were happy to see that the owner hooked us with 5 pieces of nice sized cod.  The fishes were juicy, and tartar sauce was on spot. Creamy, tangy, not too rich.  Kudos to my friend for ordering mahi mahi instead of fried cod for diversity. I was surprised at how delicious the mahi mahi tacos were despite being grilled and tasting healthy and refreshing.  The owner asked us if we would like the twinkies to come out after the meal, so that they would be fresh. Good call for that, because the fried desert was a nice way to end our meal.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but for the quality of service and food, it's worth it. I would come again next time i crave some fish and chips.   P.S.- there's a lot of food. I ended up bringing a pice of cod, a coleslaw and some fries home. Second meal is going to taste good."}
{"text":"The name says it all. My husband saw this place on yelp an decided to give a try. Im soooo glad we did....I had the fish tacos an they were  amazing. The flavor was amazing an fresh pico de gallo. Best fish tacos ever.  My husband had the captains platter an it was equally as good. The fish was fresh an cooked perfectly. We will definitely be back again. If you like fresh fish an chips then I say you must try this place.  It's literally OFF THE HOOK..."}
{"text":"It was raining out which made me think of the coast. Yelping the best clam chowder in Las Vegas brought me here. The food came out really fast, like in 5 minutes, so this would be a great lunch break spot. The clam chowder was really good, not too thick and not too thin with lots of clams. Not the best I've ever had but the best I've had in town! The Texas toast it came with was delicious, especially dipped in the chowder. Keep in mind the chowder is only available Friday and Saturday, which I did not know from reading Yelp reviews, but luckily we happened to go on a Friday. My husband was going to get the fish and chips because how could you not given the name of the restaurant, but he saw on the specials board a lobster roll and couldn't resist. The roll itself was small but with lots of lobster. My husband had suspected it might be fake lobster given the quantity and price and a taste not of lobster he couldn't identify. I edited my original review after the owner commented saying they add crab to the role to keep the price down, which is likely the taste he wasn't used to in a lobster roll. He still said it was good but next time would get the fish and chips. The chips the lobster roll came with were good, he didn't eat the coleslaw so we can't speak to it."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Amazing coleslaw. It's made fresh when you order it!!! Friendly service!:-)  We LOVED it! I will make this my regular fish and chips stop for sure. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The place was busy because the food and device was excellent. Ordered the med fish and chips. Came with coleslaw too. Fish and chips hot and fresh cooked to order. Very good. Please do not take the drive anywhere else but here for fish and chips"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Vegas for fish and chips!!! Prices are great. Service is excellent! I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"We wanted fish and chips while in Vegas and a friend recommended this place. The owner approached our table during our meal just to check on our experience. One of a kind place love it! Food was great"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Consistent each and every time I have been here. Staff is friendly and attentive. 5 start for fish and chip as well as service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided we should go to OFF THE HOOK for lunch today. I am usually not a big fan of fish and chips but I figured we would try it. He got the large fish and chips and I went with the fish tacos that way we could both share. Both dishes were amazing and were more than filling. The owner is extremely nice and very customer friendly. He does everything him self and still manages to maintain a very well keep restaurant. I highly recommend this place to anyone, and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. It looked & smelled delicious but lacked taste. I tried the prawns, fish & shrimp. Bland with a taste of tap water. $60 worth of food went into the garbage. The dessert fryer was broken, I know that wasn't their fault, but they haven't been open that long. I should have taken it as a sign to go elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious fish! Light and tasty. Can't wait to go back. Reasonably priced and casual atmosphere. A must try!"}
{"text":"We had the fish tacos. They were good, need more sauce, and the coleslaw was not my favorite. Recommend giving it a try to make the call yourself."}
{"text":"I tried the lobster&crab roll and the fish n chips.  The lobster&crab roll had way too much tarragon.  Call me a purist, but lobster rolls should not have any tarragon.  Don't get me wrong.  I like tarragon.  I just don't think it belongs on a lobster roll and if you decide to use it you need to know it's a powerful herb.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  Also I want to point out that this was not crab.  It was imitation crab and if you're going to serve it you should not be calling it crab on the menu.  I may be wrong, but the lobster seemed more like langoustines than real lobster.   Still the bun was spot on.  It was grilled perfectly on both sides and was shaped like a real New England hot dog bun.  It had just the right mix of mayo for the meat.  The fish n chips were OK.  I didn't really like the batter.  For one thing they were somewhat overcooked.  The fries were fresh and well made.  The portion size was good.  The pieces of fish were quite large.  I was really close giving 3 stars, but I went for four because I like seafood and the service was good.  Any time a seafood place appears that's better than average I want to give it a try.  I'll try this place again for something different."}
{"text":"Worth the drive from North Las Vegas.  Shrimp were a bit undercooked for my taste but the fish was done perfectly. Maybe needed a little more seasoning but the lemon pie for dessert just made everything perfect! Kids ate everything on their plates so that's a PLUS!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant !!  Huge portions of cod fish. The coleslaw tastes awesome and was freshly made.   Customer service was great and friendly. Dan was very attentive and made sure we had a great meal.."}
{"text":"They get a 5 on food for sure it looks like a dive but don't let that fool you I'm a total foodie .... the food is totally amazing! The problem is the lousy service if they could get their act together with that they'd be in number 1 tip top shape!"}
{"text":"3 stars for service, atmosphere, and the possibility that i picked the wrong thing to eat here.    My girlfriend and I went here based off of the reviews we saw on yelp. I have to assume that either all these 5 star ratings stemmed from having a different chef or they really enjoyed the customer service. Which, by the way, was pretty good. I don't remember the counter girls name, but she was sweet. Anyway we came for fish and chips and left hungry and bummed. The fish was greasy, more breading than fish, and the worst part was it was not seasoned. I am sad to say, I am still on the search for the best fish and chips in Vegas."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are the best in town by far.5 star all the way and highly recommend it.GREAT!"}
{"text":"Deliscious....  the fish was perfectly cooked and crispy outside.  The 3 piece was too much for me and I had to take the last one to go (and mind you I can eat)!   The fresh cod was so flavorful and juicy inside wow.   I've seen this place and finally tried it because of their special and boy am I happy I did...  I will have to take my father-in-law here because he loves a good fish and chips."}
{"text":"First time here and I came for Fish & Chips. I ended up getting a fish wrap that had avocado, cabbage, Thai sauce, and fresh pico.  It came with a side of coleslaw and fries. Overall it was great.  Good amount of food for the price. Gentleman working the restaurant was friendly and helpful with ordering. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Wow such a nice little hidden place. Has vegetarian options as well! :-)  My cousin ordered the mahi fries, which a half order was ginormous!!! BUT nonetheless, verrrry delicious! I ordered the lobster roll, and I checked in so it only came out to about 5 dollars.  Price per quality per quantity per taste, an amazing little shop. Makes my little pescatarian soul happy."}
{"text":"Went to Off The Hook last night (Saturday) only 4 people when we showed up. Have to wonder why so few people. Damn people don't know what they are missing. The food was AWESOME. Perfectly cooked fish and chips. And the desert deep fried cheesecake. Out of this world. Will defiantly go back. The owner Dan is a great guy."}
{"text":"This my friends is the real deal. Absolutely hands down the best fresh fish and chips in Las Vegas and I have been here for 27 years. The Cajon fried shrimp is a unique and tasty treat. The fried scallops are truely a rare treat this far north and west. OK it's all the best of the best.  The restaurant is small(ish) but it's clean, well lit and cozy comfortable. Even the potty wasn't the scary trip we encounter so often.  I found this lovely spot on Groupon but didn't buy a coupon and didn't need one. The price is reasonable and the volume of food is well above the average.  I have to say a word about Dan, he has absolutely gotta be the nicest person I have ever met (really) and and he adds to this delightful dining experience like no one I can remember.  If you're over that way for any reason, hungry or not, this is a treat that you should not pass on. We fish lovers plan to reture real soon."}
{"text":"Ivar's in the desert city of Las Vegas! Not actually Ivar's but close enough. If you're looking for great fish and chips, go to off the hook.  I had the three-piece cod and with the coupon you can get four pieces which is a really good deal. The prices are a little higher than what you find in Seattle but the fish pieces are huge.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"So I gotta confess that I am a pretty healthy eater, so on my cheat day I am looking for something that really satisfies. The curb appeal at Off the Hook was not great, but I shrug it off as many places with good food lack that. The place was not crowded but there were alot of take out orders. The staff was friendly and service was fast. The cod was definitely the star of the show! A little more breading than I would like but still crispy and the fish was nice and firm. My kid ordered the regular white fish. It was much more flaky but he enjoyed it. Now things go south a bit. The coleslaw was too creamy for my palate and lacked the crispness that I enjoy.  The fries were descent but not fresh and a bit under seasoned. We also had a few chicken strips but would not recommend them (its a fish place anyway!) The portions were generous so unless your really hungry, stick with the 2 piece meal. Overall, I would give them 3.5 stars. If you are just serving fish and chips you need to elevate your game and I don't feel they did. Off the Hook is just a bit off the mark. I feel if they made a few changes it could be a \"go to\" place but right now I will settle for a few good pieces of cod now and then sans the chips and slaw."}
{"text":"In Vegas on Friday. No meat. Yelped this place and it was really good. Couldn't go 5 stars cause $20 for 3 piece Fish and chips is steep for a carry out place."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook!  Food is fresh and has great taste. We ordered fish, chips & zucchini spears.  The fish was nice and crispy, fries perfectly cooked & zucchini spears were great. The Creamy Asian sauce is Amazing, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Just as the name says, this place is \"Off the Hook\"! After months of saying we're going to try this restaurant every time we're nearby to raid Pokémon gyms, we finally found the opportunity. Three of us just came from work and were hangry so we started right off the bat with the Family Size order of fish 'n chips and added the spicy cauliflower bites and Cape Shark tenders for good measure.  The tenders and bites came in first with the tenders proving to be irresistibly addicting with its crispy batter and flaky-tender hearty meat complemented by the tartar dip--we'd order more if it weren't for our large order coming in. The cauliflower bites are fantastic spicy bites, it is so crunchy and delicious you'd forget you were eating your veggies!  After almost being full from the apps, the star of the meal came in hot and golden. Our first scorching bite was absolutely delicious! The (huge) fish strips was perfectly cooked: light and crispy outside, tender and flaky inside without being dry or soggy and paired so well with the coleslaw and creamy tartar 'dip' (I mixed mine with Tabasco for some zing!)--definitely one of the best if not the best tasting fish and chips we've ever had, and it's not just the hunger talking. Did I mention the crispy, golden chips aka fries is just as good as the fish they came with?  We'll definitely be back for more as there's a lot of good items on the menu to be explored, not to mention that I can play Pokémon GO and spin the stops while waiting for the food to be served by the awesome folks who work there."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Not a seafood eater, but this place is Off The Hook.. And the owner Dan is a sweetheart.."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday in Lent, but at just the right time before the rush mwahaha.  Small place, clean, well lit. Not much to it, really.  The food was standard fare. The fish and chips were a bit pricey, my 5 piece combo was $30. Probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Off the Hook is located on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo in a small shopping center with other eateries.   I visited Off the Hook one Thursday night when I was craving some good fish. I walked in and was greeted by two employees. I was given a menu with all the food listed and decided on ordering the two piece cod with shrimp and fires. I also used my yelp check-in that gives you one item free. I received and extra piece of cod yum! I ordered my food to go and it was made to order. It did not take long but it gave me enough time to check out the restaurants decor and cool pictures throughout.  The cod is huge! I can normally eat my cod and shrimp but this time I could only eat one piece of cod and two pieces of shrimp with a little fries. I had plenty to share with my fiance for dinner and he enjoyed it. In the to-go bag it comes with tarter sauce, vinegar, and ketchup. The fish was good and crispy."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I ordered food for delivery, Mahi tacos and Cajun jumbo shrimp. My food came super quick and was soo tasty. Portion sizes are huge and decent prices too! The one thing I will say is if you're trying to be healthy, this might not be the seafood you're looking for. Mostly everything I saw on the menu is fried, but the food is sooo delicious! Highly recommended! Needless to say, this place is off the HOOK. Haha"}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful.  Fast and friendly service.  Will try calamari next time. The fish and chips were perfectly cooked flaky without being dry and the batter was light and crispy."}
{"text":"Went to this place per recommendation of a coworker. It is conveniently located at Buffalo and Flamingo with ample parking space.   I ordered fish and fries, grilled mahi-mahi tacos and lobster roll for takeout. I'll probably stick with fish; it was crunchy outside and moist inside. The coleslaw is fresh.  They have mostly fried stuff so I'm glad they have something  grilled like the  mahi-mahi tacos which are pretty good and well seasoned. I also ordered the lobster roll which I had to throw away, as it had a funky formalin smell like those artificial crabs. I would have been more than willing to pay for more if they serve the real thing. I wish I've known about this before I ordered.   I also found out they have daily specials which are pretty good deals.   Overall, service is good, convenient location. Fish and chips are good. I'll stay away from lobster and crab rolls, unless you're okay with artificial stuff."}
{"text":"My 6 year old daughter and I had a great meal and Christine gave great service. This is our 4th time here and is awesome for fish and chips. Definitely give this place a look. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Try the fish tacos with the creamy Asian sauce!! Melt in your mouth, burst of flavor delicious! And we love the father-son duo!!"}
{"text":"Fish n chips has been my favorite food since I was a kid and this place is ridiculous!!! Me and my girlfriend tried them out today and I'm so glad we did. The batter on the fish was perfect and crispy and that's after driving 15 minutes to my house. the sauce is very mild and delicious, and most importantly the quality of the food is great and fresh!!! you can tell as soon as you taste it. I'm so glad I found this spot their food kicks ass and I will definitely hit them up regularly."}
{"text":"Let me just say...AMAZING Fish and Chips!!  Las Vegas is not known for the quality of it's fish and chip restaurants. Off The Hook fish N chips breaks the mold. Where high quality food meets hometown customer service. They have created the recipe for success. Featuring a chef with a flair of creativity that still honors the flavorful traditions of the food you've always loved. A front house staff that always makes your family feel welcome. Rounded out with generous portions of food that are of the highest, freshest quality.  I would highly recommend them to anyone with a craving for a great dining experience..:-)"}
{"text":"The vegan options here are incredible! Lots to choose from and the po boy was delicious! Small joint but friendly staff. Definitely worth a visit.n"}
{"text":"First timers! Ordered the fried cod and fries and scallops. Generous portions of fish! Batter is super light and fish tasted fresh not fishy or overly seasoned. Lots of dipping sauces to choose from. For dessert we had the fried Oreos! Let me tell you that was unbelievably delicious. Serviced with a modest cup of chocolate chip ice cream!  Super friendly staff, and clean dining space. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips!!  Cooked to order so it comes out nice and hot.  Ordered the 4 piece cod with Yelp check in for an extra piece.  Also, ordered onion rings.  Everything was super tasty and service was awesome."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS!! The scallops were cooked perfectly, the shrimp was extremely flavorful, and the breading was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This local gem is Fantastic! I loved the dessert choices here but be ready for a food coma after! Lots of fried foods but delicious nonetheless... Extremely accommodating & friendly staff too! So glad this place is right around the corner from my house! Def going back"}
{"text":"Place was dead, signs all over the place saying we don't take coupons anymore...so according to them no business is better than some business..ask them to see their health dept letter grade, guess what they don't have one!?!? extra star only because lady working there is very nice."}
{"text":"Great customer service. One of the best fish and chips I had in a very long time. Next trip I will try their fried cheesecake."}
{"text":"Want fish and chips, this is the place. Friendly service. Went above and beyond to accommodate to our baby :)"}
{"text":"We got our food delievered but wow crazy big portion for really affordable price. We got the zuccini fries, mahi mahi tacos and fish&chips."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the best fish and chips I have had since moving to Las Vegas from Seattle 2 years ago. The filets are HUGE and the beer batter is nice a crispy. I ordered a large order of fish and chips, it was more than enough and well worth the price. The cole slaw was so refreshing and they don't use a large amount of sauce in it like most restaurants do. I will be coming back here very soon. Thank you Off The Hook for being the best Fish and Chips I have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been looking forward to coming here all week... she had a Groupon, so we decided to try it out.   I'm very confused by the reviews on Yelp. Our experience was borderline bad. At one point we heard the server tell a table that \"the service isn't usually like this\". I should hope not since the reviews are so high.   Overall, our waitress was very friendly, but the service was just poor. We got there after 6pm and the place was kind of busy. I'm not sure if they were short on staff, but it seemed everyone was and had been waiting for their orders.   One table was so upset because my friend and I received our order before them (they were there before us) they left without paying after they ate.   The food was mediocre at best... Everything was too greasy and lacked flavor. For something that took so long to get, it just wasn't worth the wait.   I can't say that I'll be back again. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"I was convinced upon walking in to try it out...I obliged!  Id eat here again... I ordered the small fish n chips."}
{"text":"First time at Off The Hook Fish & Chips, ate with my mother just coming out of work. It's this cute little place that my mom found on buffalo and flamingo not too far from where we work. When you first time check in you can get one free fish stick so we used that and my mom had a groupon 2 for $30 dinner. We ordered mozzarella sticks, a medium (2 fish sticks) & large(3 fish sticks) fish & chips both had the chips and coleslaw. Mozzarella sticks were great, no marinara sauce though but they still tasted great with the ranch that was given with it. Definitely satisfied my craving for melted cheese in stick form ^_^ When the fish & chips came presentation looked awesome, good sizes for the fish. I had high hopes for these fishys because my fish & chips experience in Las Vegas were thick breading, sogginess and fish falling out of the breading plus saltiness. But Off The Hook Fish & Chips was the best I've tasted in Las Vegas. Their breading is light, crunchy and I didn't have any whole pieces of fish sliding out of my breading while eating it. I was very impressed with the fish probably the only place I'll go to for Fish & Chips now cause they actually do fish& chips the right and tasteful way. Thank you Off The Hook for restoring my faith in fish & chips :))"}
{"text":"We ate here a few days ago. There were 4 of us.  Our first impression was that it didn't smell like fried food and/or fishy.   5 stars for that, because we didn't leave smelling like that either.  When we started to order, I suggested the server might want to write it down.  No, he would be ok.  Well, he wasn't ok.  We ordered 2 catfish bites appetizers, got one order and reminded him of the other.  But they were catfish strips and we were charged for catfish filet meals (we didn't get fries with these).  The food was good, but it all came out one or two items at a time.   2 orders oysters.  Got one.  Then the other later.  2 orders catfish bites. Got one.  Had to ask for the second order.   1 order hush puppies.  First thing to come out.  1 lobster roll 1 small coleslaw 1 four piece fish and chips 1 order calamari, which was the worst thing we ordered.   About 7 trips for all of this.  And there was only one other table of 2 that already had their food when we got there.    Will we return?   Maybe.  But I'll write the order down for the guy.   And they've discontinued the scallops, which was the main item I wanted."}
{"text":"A little fish and chips place located off the beaten path was a little surprise. We ordered the Alaskan Cod, which was more then plenty for 2-3 people. The fish was lightly battered and fried perfection; fries were evenly done and crispy as well. The tarter sauce had just the right amount of mayonnaise and the coleslaw brought the whole dinner together.  It was a little on the pricier side but well worth the cost to get the Alaskan cod!"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying the owner Robert Ferrara is the absolute best!!!!! Mr. Ferrara went completely out of his way to make sure my daughter and anyone else that is allergic to gluten had gluten free buns the day of our visit last week. Now... if you're thinking that if you had the gardein fishless filets or the beyond burger what's the big deal right? WRONG! Well it is a big deal The because it's OFF THE HOOK (some of you get it LOL) the way it's prepared here it's not right out of the bag nope, no sir and it's served with slaw right on top of the filets that's very tasty I must say and the beyond burger I'm guessing is seasoned a little different from everywhere else because it was better from some of the other places that serves it!  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"First time I have REAL fish and chips! Their onion rings are amazing! Great friendly homelike service, Angelo and Robert are super sweet!"}
{"text":"best fish & chips I had in Vegas. Fish was white and flaky and firm. 5 star. Fries ok, coleslaw very good. Place is hard to find at night time since no sign yet. Not a fancy place but fish was the best in town."}
{"text":"I live near by & tend to always buy water next door. I always seen this place but never had the chance to actually come in & try it out. Glad I did! The staff was friendly & place was clean! I ordered from the Al La Carte section of the menu. I chose the Lobster roll, 1 Large piece of Battered White fish, & 2 orders of the Scallops. & when I got my food I was surprise to how much there was. The scallops were plump and fish was huge for only $1.99 a piece. My roll was full of Lobster & the Hawaiian roll itself was toasted to perfection. It wasn't hard or soggy. The sauces in the lobster wasn't over powering so you could taste the actual lobster! Will come again! A must try!"}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem. Stopped here weigh the fellas and we ordered the fried shrimp and fried oysters for appetizers.  To my surprise the shrimp were jumbo and cooked to perfection with a tempera batter. The oysters were delicious as well with a traditional cornmeal crust. For entree, we all had the Skipper which consists 2 fish fillets, 2 shrimp, 2 sea scallops and fries. The fish was perfectly fried and not greasy at all. I will definitely be returning. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try an exclusive fish & chips place in Vegas for quite sometime & I'm glad I finally did. This place is located a bit west from the strip but if you're in for a fishy time, the drive is worth it.   During our visit, we ordered a couple items, including:  1. Hush Puppies * 6 little puppies that are exquisitely delicious...I can't even describe how well the flavors were blended, and the fact that they were NOT rock hard is the reason this may someday be the sole reason I drive halfway through Vegas*  2. Lobster Roll *disclaimer*  We should have read the menu a bit more carefully because unfortunately we missed the word COLD in the description for this bad boy. I love my seafood, but I think this one was a little less lobster & a little more other seafood for me. The first bite was excellent, and then the second bite...I was ready to get my fish & chips back.  3. SAILOR combination plate  * 2 piece fish & chips w| 3 jumbo shrimp.*  Now THIS is definitely one of the finest fish & chips in Vegas. I'm content we chose this platter rather than just fish & chips or shrimp...cause we got the best of both worlds. The fish was thoroughly fried; the batter wasn't overbearing -- and that's how fried fish should be...more fish, less batter!   The proportions of ALL dishes were more than enough for our party of 2. We actually ended up getting a to go box because we couldn't finish.   The customer service was on point, friendly and attentive. Just a little more attentiveness from us on that lobster roll would have made this a perfect date."}
{"text":"Your crazy if you don't think this place deserves 5 stars!!!! I have been meaning to try this place for a really long time. I was craving fish and chips yesterday so I brought my mom and two year old son. As soon as we arrived and sat down my son decided to throw a temper tantrum. The gentleman that was serving us was still very sweet despite the crying and loud noise. I felt terrible so we decided to take it to go. The inside was super clean and the to go order came out fast and fresh!! The food was beyond amazing. The portions were large, the fish was fresh and not greasy at all. By the time we got home the french fries we're still crispy and hot (unheard of) they were super tasty!! Even the coleslaw was good. It's not every day that you order from a restaurant and everything on the plate tastes delicious!! Thanks guys for a great experience. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Nice ftiendly service.  A drive from the strip but well worth it.  The onions rings were rockin'.  Zuchinni fries...juicy on inside and crispy on outside.  Hush puppies full of flavor.  Codfish was not greasy and not overcooked or over battered.  Definitely will be coming back each time when in town!"}
{"text":"BS +++  Off the hook.  Off the chain! Off the  motha-effin-shelves even with a elf holding it down.  I'm from NYC and most of our best spots are spots like these.  Just places with people who love what they do and they do it well.  This place is the truth!!! It's a hole on the wall restaurant.  Everything is fresh and everyone inside is friendly.  They even let us stay an extra 32 minutes.  I was with family and they just was nice about it even though they were tired.  One of the dudes look like Action Bronson and he was mad chill.  After we left the place we chilled outside in the parking lot chatting just like in NYC.  The food didn't make us feel sleepy or oily.  Vegas folks are just down to earth.  The food was RIDICULOUS! It's most fried foods (So effin what?!) It's vegan friendly! it's just made from love and you can tell.  We ordered the lobster roll (good).  Catfish (yum) Calamari (needs to be fried longer but GOOOOOODD!) The clam chowdahhh (Drool!) The fries (fresh).  Seriously all great things and all good stuff.  I want to go back and take a bath with their other delicious food and spices.  Oh speaking of spices order the cauliflower (HOLY BANANAS that ish was OFF-THE-HOOK!)  Just a quick tip, when you come in if you don't have YELP! download it and \"CHECK IN\" and you can get a 15% discount on your total.   Food is BOMB Hostess/servers are SUPER FRIENDLY Restrooms are CLEAN Tables CLEAN Table wait time QUICK Take out wait time is QUICK Customer service is GREAT Ambiance was like a Sponge Bob Squarepants museum Kitchen SUPER CLEAN Overall experience OFF THE HOOK!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Fresh cod, beer batter, fresh scallops, must try!!   Onion ring is super yummy. Not greasy like other places  I know. Nice taste of beer batter. Home made cold slow is tasty. Over all Services is great. inside Restaurant is very clean.   Everyone who likes fish and chips is a must try this place!"}
{"text":"Doesn't taste greasy. It doesn't smell like a fryer here either. It's clean and the owner is nice. Yes it's a little pricey but he uses excellent quality cod and shrimp. We'll be back"}
{"text":"My 1st visit to Off the Hook in a smaller commercial center with a few good restaurants.. I ordered the Mahi loaded fries( great flair and just the right amount of blackened spice on the grilled mahi), hush puppies(delish)  and Whitefish two piece. The interior is basic because the emphasis is on the great food. Loved this little neighborhood gem!! The Mahi loaded fries are the Business!!"}
{"text":"A good solid fried seafood place is scarce here in the Vegas valley. This place is it though. Great and I mean great food! Sweet owners and just an all around neighborhood treat. I have enjoyed every meal if ever purchased from this place. Yummy yum yumm. Support these guys. Great food and top first class customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply AMAZING! This place reminds me of a restaurant I loved back in Newport News, VA in which their menu items are similar to this restaurant. I knew I wanted hush puppies and I also ordered their 2 piece fish special ( comes with fries and coleslaw). Now the hush puppies weren't my favorite and the sauce I believe it comes with was just okay. BUT the fish and fries was so so so so good! The fish was fried to perfection while still being moist on the inside and the fries were cooked perfectly. Lastly let me just say I HATE coleslaw and normally I would ask for no coleslaw because I don't like being wasteful. But I decided to give it a try and let's just say I couldn't put my fork or the cup it comes in down. That coleslaw was divine and so refreshing. This will definitely be a restaurant I come to when I don't feel like having my meal prep for the day."}
{"text":"I just ordered online for delivery.  I ordered the premium family pack with 6pc fish, fries, cole slaw and hush puppies.  I received the order within the time frame given to me when the order was placed.  Sadly, the food was cold so I had to put it in the oven.  I know it will cool off during transport but this seemed like it had been in the car for a while.  I also noticed that I do not have any hush puppies with my order.  There were a few people looking forward to those as it helps make the whole \"fish eating\" experience.  The fish was good.  The pieces were average size.  Cole slaw wasn't anything special but it was good.  I think if I were to try this place again I would go to the restaurant and try it fresh."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Off the Hook for some time now seeing how this was the \"spot\" in Las Vegas.  I attempted to stop by for lunch with my mom, who is a huge fish & chips lover, but it was closed on a weekday. Their hours of operation have seemed to change since then because they are now only closed on Sundays.  My boyfriend & I came in for lunch & I walked in surprised that it was a sit-down restaurant.  This is a minuscule detail that only I would get excited about, but they have bendy straws! Why can't all restaurants have bendy straws? That excitement was short-lived, however, because I spotted \"gunk\" in my boyfriend's water. I don't have a word for it because I'm not sure what it was, but we informed our waiter immediately. Apparently, there was an issue with the machine & my water had to be taken away as well even though I already had a sip because I was so excited to use my bendy straw. Yikes. We were given a cup with ice & a water bottle.  We got a glance at the menu already on Yelp, but it seemed to be updated & prices were lower than we saw previously.  I ordered their daily special, which on a Monday, is a lobster & crab roll served with fries & cole slaw. My boyfriend ordered scallops & the \"Sailor,\" which included 2 fish & chips, also used the Yelp check-in offer to have 1 additional fish & chip, 3 jumbo shrimps, fries, cole slaw & he upgraded it to cod fish.  I enjoyed my lobster & crab roll & although it wasn't as big as I thought, I got full from it. For it to include fries & cole slaw, $9.99 isn't a bad price at all.  My boyfriend enjoyed the jumbo shrimp. He could have lived without ordering the scallops & surprisingly, he didn't care for the fish & chips. I did try it & it's not the best I ever had, but it's probably going to be the best in Las Vegas that I've tried so far.  It wasn't the greatest first-time experience, but I would give this place another chance & bring my mom again to be a judge!"}
{"text":"Cod tender and not greasy.  The fish is perfectly deep fried and is not dry.  Still flaky.    Prawn batter perfect.   Scallop 20 point tasty.   Cole slaw is very good and not slimy.    Awesome."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my family. We ordered the family meal which includes premium fish, tater totes, and other side dishes. The fish is really fresh. I would recommended for people who loves fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips so far in Vegas.  Fish tacos and jumbo shrimp-delicious.  Lots of food for the price.  Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I am so glad to have found this place. Finally s good fish & chips restaurant in town. The size of the cod was huge and tasted really good, they prepare to order so you know it's made just for you. I will be back again soon and recommend off the hook for everyone"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, I loved everything!  I'm not sure if their ketchup is homemade, but is was something different (in a good way) I got their 2 fish, 2prawn, and 2scallop combo, but i got extra fish and scallop on the house!"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in at 2:30 on a weekday. There were two customers in the entire place. They have 4 two top tables and 4 four tops. Half the tables were dirty.    A guy rushes over and tries to seat us at a two top right by the front door. It was an extremely windy day and I asked if we could sit at the four top by the wall. He says no, they are reserved for party's of three or more.    I told him there are three other four tops open and lunch hour is long over. He turns his back to us and grumbles \"Fine but if someone comes your gonna have to move.\"  Nice customer service!   Our waiter was nice enough but the food was lackluster. The fried fish at McDonald's is literally better. The one good thing we had \"jalapeño poppers\" I'm pretty sure was from the restaurant next door.    This place won't be here long. Too bad because there's not a good fish and chips place in the area. Don't waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I wasn't in the fish & chip mood and it was very tasty.  We got the Family Fish & Chips - 6 Piece White Fish includes hush puppies, large fries, and large slaw.  For fried fish, it was very tender and juicy.  I could careless for the hush puppies and large slaws.  There were whatever.  The fries weren't bad.  We did DoorDash and the fish and fries were still hot and crispy.    I would come back here if I'm ever in the mood for Fish & Chips!"}
{"text":"Great little family owned buisness. Their fish n chips, shrimp combo is amazing. Service is great.  I love a place where the owner takes your order, and helps out to make your order.  Best fish n chips in town.."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this place given the good reviews I saw on Yelp.  I saw particularly good things about the shrimp and scallops and I was looking forward to that.  So I go to the restaurant and find out that the fine print on the Groupon says I can't get any of the shrimp or scallops.  So I ended up getting like 3 pounds of cod, which was fine, but most of which got discarded.  Waste of money - if you're going to restrict menu options, it shouldn't be buried in the fine print so that you end up with angry customers when they show up.  I've never encountered a Groupon where specific menu items weren't included, and I can't begin to figure out why they would do it.  The whole point of a Groupon is to bring in new customers and convince them to come back and become a regular customer - why in the world would you not let the customer order what they want?    Bottom line - I felt deceived, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos. Very generous servings. Came with delicious coleslaw. The fries were perfect. We definitely would eat at this restaurant again. The owner came and chatted with us and was happy to hear what we had to say."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE...  I ordered a medium fish and chips. It was $15... It was very tiny for $15 and average quality fish/batter.  I requested ketchup and extra tartar sauce on the side. They gave me a single tiny ketchup packet and RANCH DRESSING NOT TARTAR SAUCE (see pictures). I wouldn't expect this kind of service and quality from jack in the box. DO NOT GO HERE  EDIT: went here again on a groupon deal... Food was good and prepared as requested... I am bumping my review up to 3 stars..."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking!  Why would I eat Fish & Chips in a desert?  Well, hear me out.  I traveled through New Zealand last summer and I've been to the United Kingdom and I can honestly say without a doubt that Off The Hook's fish and chips were among the best I've ever had!    I grew up hating fish because I thought it tasted as bad as it smelled, and then a friend of mine told me that fresh fish doesn't have that fishy smell.  He also told me you can taste it.  That fishy smell and taste?  You won't find it here.    My partner and I ordered a basket of the Regular Fish & Chips (Whitefish) as well as the Premium Fish & Chips (Cod).  The breading is great and was perfectly fried both times that I've been here.  The regular Whitefish pieces are actually a little bigger than the Premium Cod so you do get more bang for your buck there.  The tartar sauce is fantastic and I loved it so much I needed one side per piece of fish.  My partner and I both ordered two pieces each and we were full.  The chips (fries) were also delicious.  Off The Hook is very affordable and I am now a regular.  Try it, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon, the application glitched, business and groupon refused to honor it. Basically a bait and switch...   Speaking of bait ... if you need some maybe off the hooks food will help you catch some better fish.   Note to business owner .. groupon customer service is doing you no favors as they said you, not groupon, is why my groupon did not work at your business. Maybe you ought to call your rep and I will consider revising, if not I have a huge twitter and IG and facebook following that i will be publishing piss poor reviews on ... enjoy"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, place.  Service was excellent.  Fish & Chips were great.  Fish sandwich had too much seasoning, which over powered the muted flavor of the fish.  The fish taco was \"meh.\"  If you want simple and tasty Fish & Chips, this is the place."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from the reviews on here.  I was looking for a fish and chips restaurant, and I wanted to avoid the strip. I created an account on yelp just to talk about this place.  It was excellent!  Fresh and good, not greasy.  The owner if very nice, and down to earth.     I had the fish and chips my boyfriend had the fish tacos.  And we finished with the fried cheesecake, cuz that is all everyone else talks about on yelp.  We were not disappointed.    This is a must if you want fish and chips in this city."}
{"text":"I miss Skippers. It seems like no one can make lightly battered fish and chips like they did. Wait! Until I found Off the Hook last night. It was 7pm on a Saturday and I was craving some tasty fish and chips, so I ordered delivery directly from Yelp. Less than 30min later a fellow was at my door with 4 pieces of lightly battered fish and chips perfection. A warning: the pieces of fish are HUGE! A 4 piece could easily feed 2 people. It was amazing! Two thumbs up and I no longer miss Skippers. But I do have a craving for Off the Hook, so I will be back very soon! Thanks for the great food and great delivery service. Only way it could have been better is if you offered clam chowder with it. ;)"}
{"text":"Off the hook's customer service is pretty great. I used to eat there when I worked closer a few times. I work a bit farther now and figured to order lunch from here through yelp since I was craving seafood. Upon receiving my order a few things were missing so I double checked my order and it said it was a meal and not a single item order. So I called them and explained, the person that answered thought it was a single item order and reviewed my order and said it was his mistake. He gave me two options and I went with having the rest of my order delivered to me. I had payed in cash so I did not want to bother with being credited. They gave me a large order of fries which were super yummy and some hush puppies. Will definitely be ordering from here again. And the fried oreos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Second time to visit this place, first time was just after they opened, food was okay on that visit but not spectacular. Employees were friendly but the food was simply not good, I ordered the premium fish and chips, with tip I paid nearly $28 dollars. The portions were large but the fish was greasy and the batter very dark, looked and tasted over cooked, no flavor. Heard the girl at the counter telling another customer that they have new owners and cooks and they \"have no idea what they are doing\". I know this is a mom and pop shop and I truly hope they get it together and do well, I prefer to eat at locally owned places but this one won't be on my list."}
{"text":"Tried the fish and chips (of course) and grilled mahi tacos.  The fish seemed to be fresh, was tender, and had nice flavor but was a little greasier than it should have been.  The tacos were good with nice flavor and no greasiness (in contrast to the fried fish).  We asked for very-crunchy fries but only got slightly-crunchy fries.  Wish more places would almost-burn them when asked.  Pricing is average but a steal with a Groupon (not good on scallops or shrimp).  Lots of strip mall parking, and they have punch card loyalty program, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Probably the best fish and chips I've been to in Vegas. If you're in the are definitely stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got here last Thursday with my girlfriend, because we saw great review about this place. Inside of this place, there were plenty of customers that are already inside of the restaurant. I have ordered Fish & Chips + Chicken fingers combo, instead of fries, I asked for onion rings for extra $2 charge. My girlfriend ordered Fish & Chips + Shrimp combo with onion rings instead of fries also.  To start off, fish was melting in my mouth, so tender, crispy outside, which was what I have expected to have. It was great size also, So I really thought that the price was reasonable. Onion ring was a bit burnt, and salty in my opinion. But you know what? They insisted to comp my onion rings because there were a bit of delay, so which was good. I really liked my chicken fingers, but I believed that the size was a bit smaller than what I have expected, and it actually was salty too. My girlfriend loved the fish too no fishy smell, tender and crispy outside, but she actually was not big fan of the shrimp and onion rings with the same reason that I had, salty. She said she had some strong fishy smell into shrimp.  Overall, I really liked this place, great main food, which is fish. I might be asking them if I can make that as a salty free, because I really eat things plain. I will for sure come back if I am craving for the fish & chips."}
{"text":"After my second experience I will never return. I will be nice and not write why on yelp."}
{"text":"Hard to find good fish and chips in Vegas.  This was awesome! The coleslaw is so good and you can tell it's freshly made.   A co-worker took me here for lunch and we had the cod fish and chips. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Drove a small distance to get to this place because I really wanted some fish and it had good reviews. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I didn't find it very flavorable. It wasn't worth the drive or the money for me."}
{"text":"So okay. I decided to try somewhere different than the usual quick Chinese or Hawaiian bbq for lunch. I was craving fish and chips...I found this place online...pretty decent reviews. Well I probably should have kept reading. I'll start with the good...The shrimp were great...crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Scallops were the same. Things went all the way wrong with the fish....This was really bad and I think it's fighting back as I type this review! The pieces were huge, golden brown, cooked nicely on the outside. The first piece was thinner, so I ate it. Had a little bit of a strange taste, but it's fish. The second piece,  I should have thrown into the trash! It was super thick and not well cooked, pink and kind of cold. I decided to microwave it because I was not about to drive all the way back over there! My lunch break was over. For the price the meal should have been better. Stop selling fish that's on its way to expired, seriously! I thought of being courteous and calling them, but they weren't courteous enough to sell me fresh fish so too bad for them. I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my son. Ordered two piece fish/chips and 1 piece combo with shrimp/scallops. It was a good amount of food and also because he gave us an extra piece of fish each. Everything that came with our lunch were pretty good, needed a little bit more seasoning but maybe not everyone likes their food with more salt n pepper like I do. It's a small restaurant and when we were there it wasn't that busy. The guy was by himself I think but he was very nice and efficient. The batter on the fish and seafood was nice and crunchy, the French fries were good. Would definitely go back when we want fish and chips again.   This place is right next to Komex on Buffalo, lots of parking."}
{"text":"Great spot for fish and chips. Served hot and fresh. Great prices. Nice light fresh cole slaw. This was our second visit. Tonight we had the cod instead of the white fish. Delicious! Next time we might try the lobster roll and the poppers. This is a no frills restaurant but the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"We thought it was great. Had the regular fish and chips. Very fresh and tasty.  Meal came to the table very hot, not mushy at all The potions are generous. The waiter/cook was very polite and friendly. The only thing I noticed is the \"chips\" which are traditionally round with ridges were french fries. Cole slaw was good too. They have short hours. Get there before they close"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good place to get fish and chips for a while I think I just found it. Everything was made to order and the fish was super fresh. You never know what you're gonna get when you try a new place but I was impressed with my fish basket and will definitely be back when I need my fried fish fix. So bomb!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. 1st time. Very good fish and chips. Had the fried haddock. Will definitely come back. Only complaint is it's hard to see from the street. It's at the back of the complex."}
{"text":"I tried this place today only because door dash offered a free delivery.  I wouldn't go back.  I've had better lobster rolls and it was just ok.  The jumbo shrimp was fried and I was expecting jumbo cocktail shrimp.  Nothing on the menu stayed it was going to be fried shrimp.  For $20 I was very disappointed.  I order food to go daily and would not go back.  I DID NOT receive fries nor coleslaw wth my meal.  The fried shrimp had to much batter and all you can taste was the batter.  I took one bite and threw them away."}
{"text":"This is the best fish spot in Vegas in my opinion. Since  new owners have taken over the food has  been so awesome. Great combos and service off the hook. If your looking for fish and chips look no more they can't be beat. Melt in your mouth goodness. Go get some it's off the hook."}
{"text":"It is very hard to find a place where my meat-eating husband and my vegan self can eat together. Well this place hit the spot. The vegan P.O. boy and coleslaw was absolutely delicious. My husband had the lobster roll which he said was okay and a fish taco which was good. The waiter/busboy was working very hard. I could tell this place was good when I walked in and it was busy inside. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fish person but my fiancé wanted to try this place out so I got the grilled cheese. Was soooo good! Clean and great service! Found this place on Yelp & not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not sure how the rates are so good. We did the fish and chips and the fish tacos, the fish and chips were over cooked, the fish tacos were pretty average, tarter sauce and malt is the crap in little packets like you get from low end fast food places. Over all it was ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"Little place off the strip....very good....bomb fish and chips...clam chowder could have been hotter but overall good food. Friendly customer service."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fish in general, but this place has changed my mind.  It was the absolute best fish I have ever had.  Everything here is fresh and hand made and it shows.  The fish was hand battered when we ordered it...The slaw was crisp and fresh and the hush puppies!!!  Oh the hushpuppies were slap the knee good. The place is a hidden gem.  They have a product that is better than any of the upscale places in Vegas and 1/4 the cost.  You will not be disappointed.   DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT forget to buy the fried cheesecake - it is DELISH!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Just went here for lunch today and was very impressed. The fish is very fresh and cooked perfectly, as are the fries. Everything came out hot and crispy- exactly how it should be. I even enjoyed the child slaw, which says a lot since I normally don't like it.  The restaurant is very clean and service very friendly. If you are in the mood for fish and chips, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Raised Catholic on the Great Lakes it was for Lent every year that Fish-frys overtook Friday night, the local Churches offering up whatever random White Fish they could find after depleting the Walleye, but here 20+ years later it was a billboard about Ash Wednesday that inspired a second visit to Off the Hook for anything but the boring options of childhood.  Originally visited in early 2017 and largely unchanged in the thirteen intervening months, the street sign on Buffalo listed as only Fish N' Chips with nearby KoMex Fusion as well as Babystacks still doing bang-up business despite their mediocrity, it was with an order placed online that Off The Hook was entered at 11:45am with the kitchen running behind by just a few minutes, two lunch specials plus a Side and Dessert tallying just over thirty dollars for enough Food to easily feed three people.  Recently adding some Vegan and Gluten-Free choices to a laminated menu plus daily specials featured on a blackboard it was with Styrofoam clamshells and cardboard boats wrapped in plastic plus paper bags that several pounds were carried upstairs to the office and unpacked, two Hushpuppies that were supposed to be included with the Catfish missing but everything else exactly as described on the menu and nicely presented despite being packed and driven almost fifteen minutes.  Hand-breading and frying a wide variety of items to order, line-caught Cod from the previous visit this time served as smaller nuggets on Tortilla Shells with Spicy Sauce, those looking for a filling Lunch for under $10 would do well to check this out with Regular or Sweet Potato Fries, the former additionally offered in a spicy version alongside the 8oz Catfish Fillet dusted in Cornmeal that comes across with all the expected flavor while remaining light and virtually oilless.  Finding Off The Hook's Coleslaw more enjoyable than most in part due to the thicker cuts of Cabbage and a light sweetness it was likely a result of the lengthy drive and steam inside the bag that Onion Rings were unfortunately found to be flaccid despite fairly good flavor, the $6 price for twelve a bit steep when compared to everything else while the Key Lime Pie once again showed well without adding a bunch of food coloring like so many others, the creamy texture and bright Citrus nicely balanced on the Graham Cracker Crust with just a stripe of Whipped Cream.  ***1/2:  Definitely better for dine-in than take-out, but superior to similar local spots either way, Off The Hook remains a worthwhile stop for those looking for good fried Fish and French Fries while the menu offers enough variety that everyone can probably find something they'll enjoy."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for fish and chips. It's easy to miss as you drive by, but hard to forget if you stop in.    Let's face it... we all need some golden brown fried deliciousness in our life from time to time.  If you're going to do something fried, you've got to do it right.  The good will deliver you to the promised land, the bad is.. well bad.  Off the Hook really knows what they're doing with their fish and chips.  The batter on the fish is perfect, and not soggy or wet.  The batter sticks to the fish, and doesn't fall apart.  The fish is light, flaky, and very clean; no fishy taste whatsoever.  I've only ordered the premium fish which does cost a few bucks more, but it's amazing so I see no reason to change it.    The chips are crispy and soft, and not under salted.  Both house made tartar sauce and malt vinegar are available.  I'm not big into tartar typically, but theirs is fresh and better than most I've had.  I'd also recommend picking up the hush puppies, they're to die for."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! I love this place. They have vegan fish n chips! I am so happy I can have fried \"fish\" again! Everything offered on the vegan menu was phenomenal! The onion rings, the burgers, sandwiches, and fried oreos! The service was just as amazing as the food! They definitely accommodated our large vegan group. Thank you Robert, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Vegan options!!!  I had the fish and chips. It was Pretty tasty and a large portion. I got Cajun fries instead of regular. They're slightly spicy not too bad but a delicious flavor. The vegan fish looks like it might be tofu. The breading for the vegan fish is  fried and a good thickness.    I also got vegan tarter sauce and ranch. The tarter was good. The ranch seemed to be missing salt or a little more dill. Vegan coleslaw was okay (I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw).   Overall good experience. Clean atmosphere, nice employees.  I'll probably be back with the hope that they'll find a way to make vegan clam chowder.   I got my food to go and they placed the food in an open basket and put it in a bag. So be careful not to throw it in the car and go. I wasn't aware of this but luckily my food made it safely to my house.   A new male employee was being trained. He was nice! Hope it works out for him!!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I have eaten in Las Vegas.  Worth the drive from anywhere in town!!! Everything was so FRESH!!!  Amazing service and me and my boyfriend were happy and full. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ehh... not bad fish and chips. I really liked the French fries but for the cost it's nothing special. Paid 30 for the family deal that came with coleslaw, hush puppies, fries and 6 pieces of fish. I was expecting more seasoning and flavors. Even with the sauces they give you, I had to add hot sauces and extra stuff to make it less bland. The cashier guy was informative but not very personable. It is what it is. Lol"}
{"text":"Went here recently with a groupon. It is delicious, but expensive!  We ordered Special 1 and a Large with some fried Oreos and fried cheesecake. Well first they should tell you that anything with scallops and shrimp can't be applied to the groupon. (This review is from my visit in September 2015)"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are fantastic as are the fish and chips. Best that I've had in Las Vegas by far. The owners name is Dan. He is a very cool guy He went out of his way to make small talk with everyone that walked in. Even when he was busy he made time to listen. I will be back for sure. Almost forgot about the coleslaw. It was great. Be sure to get a side."}
{"text":"Off the hook indeed! We got a catfish, lobster roll and fish tacos. Lunch was delicious   We recommend and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! As a vegetarian, it's awesome that they have food options for vegans and vegetarians! I always get the vegan fish and chips! They are so delicious and it allows me to eat similar food options alongside my family whom all eat seafood. My mom orders the catfish nuggets and she really enjoys them. They use real catfish and not the fake kind most restaurant brand as catfish! Off The Hook is the real deal! This place is amazing and the workers are so nice and sweet! I definitely recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"This is the cutest place ever in life. When you walk in you can tell that they handle everything with attention to detail, not just the decor.    The food!!! He gave us an extra piece of fish, even though we only ordered the one piece. Yay!! The fish is thick and chunky... They take their fish and chips real serious here. Customer service is top notch. He really made sure we had everything we needed.  We'll be back!! Lol just like the name says, it's off the hook!"}
{"text":"Little pricey, but portions are great so it makes up for it. Fish cooked perfectly. If you check in and get the extra piece of fish for free, it is a lot of food."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying the atmosphere is very positive and welcoming. The art on the windows are awesome, and the decorations on the inside are even better! The theme all around is fun and kid friendly. They tend to your needs - they ask you if you're dining in or taking out when you walk in, which sets the experience. When dining in, you pick a seat and they come to you and take your order. The food is quickly made, fresh to order and the servers and cook are hilarious! There is more than enough selection on the menu... and the portions are well worth what you pay for. I usually can't even finish the plate because there's so much - but that just gives me the option to save for later... come hungry! This is my go-to fish & chips spot. My daughter LOVES it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Fish was just the way I like it. Very pleasant waitress. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Just like I remember from living in England, but without the peas and newspaper. I never liked peas anyway and newspaper is over rates. :)"}
{"text":"Caution!! Portions are huge! So make sure you bring someone to share with! Food is delicious and comes to the table very hot.   Food: very tasty, not too salty and just enough spice. We had mahi mahi fries, 6 pc catfish appetizer, mozzarella sticks, three fish tacos, cauliflower bites, and the lobster roll.   Used the 15% off check in offer from yelp.   I was under the impression that only the fish and chips came with fries but the tacos came with fries as well and cole slaw. So I ended up with a lot of fries.   Everything was great to be honest as far as the food. The server could've been a little warmer and more informative but overall we went there for the food."}
{"text":"Place has the most affordable lobster roll on mondays. The server was very attentive and answered my questions on the items. Would come back now every time I crave a lobster roll. just don't expect like Maine lobster Michelin star lobster rolls so you won't be disappointed for $9 special. A $9 lobster roll that actually is brimmed to the top and crispy chips (fries) and coleslaw? AWESOME"}
{"text":"If you like fish n chips this is your place. Hot and fresh I'll be back for sure. My wife had the fish tacos and loved them."}
{"text":"love this place and the food is delicious!! 5 stars for the food for sure! my only issue and reason for 3 stars is that whenever I order something online for pickup, the price goes up drastically $4-6 when I pay in store. It is nothing compared to the online total with tax which is a bit inconvenient and odd. As you can see my online receipt is shown below, and after picking up the food it jumped to $28 some how? I would recommend just calling in to order because ordering online the prices will be off. FOOD IS AMAZING !!"}
{"text":"I came in last Saturday.. it was just a mess. Nothing was organized.. had to ask for silverware. 2 of our 3 orders were messed up.. they even forgot my order all together. Had to ask for refills.. I understand they had a few tables come in so maybe they were short staffed or training new employees maybe?? I was just really disappointed. The mahi fries were really good though that was why I gave 3 stars.. maybe I just went on an off day. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is really off the hook best fish and chips I have had since I left NY 15 years ago. This will be my go to spot from now on when I have my cravings for fish and chips. Very friendly great service the place is nice and clean and the food is awesome. What more can you ask for. If u have not tried it you better do yourself a favor and go. Great food great portions and great service."}
{"text":"Another Groupon find! We loved the fish & chips. They were perfectly fried and tasted amazing! The shrimp was great too! I didn't care for the cocktail sauce, but hunny enjoyed it. The tartar sauce wasn't the best, but I douse my fish in vinegar, so I didn't miss it too much. Service was good. Fried Oreos were decadent! It's not a bad location, but we were solicited twice for handouts, so make sure you're careful!"}
{"text":"They changed owner. The fish is still good. I was not able to finish everything. The portion of the side orders are pretty big."}
{"text":"Nice Quaint restaurant located in Spring Valley South buffalo fish and chips portions are huge prices are great the young lady who took my order was absolutely fabulous she was very professional very very helpful and the menu has a great variety of seafood I ordered the large fish and chips they were not greasy very very fluffy huge portions once again also I ordered an appetizer of the jumbo shrimp which was all so very very good and also cooked to Perfection great place another Vegas gem"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips ever fresh and cooked just perfect , steak fries just right , so yummy ! So clean inside, ppl so kind and fast , highly recommend"}
{"text":"Probably the best fish and chips I've had in Vegas. The clam chowder is a must and the cole slaw tasted very fresh.   I've been here a few times and service has always been great, but today there was a server for dine in instead of just ordering at the counter. It was her first day but she was still very attentive and they really went above and beyond to make sure we had a positive experience.   We ordered the fish wrap, 4 piece cod (which came with cole slaw and fries) and an order of clam chowder. Everything was great and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest place but clean.   The food was super fresh, delivered hot and there is plenty of it. The catfish was properly cooked and tasty.  The fries were super crispy and really good.  The shrimp were huge and had good flavor.    Be aware that the previous owners were running a promotion with restaurant.com for discount certificates.   The new owners are not part of this program and do not accept these certificates.  Don't be mad at them, they see none of the money that you paid for these certificates. Exchange them for a different establishment.  It is not their fault.    The owners are new and trying really hard.  Really nice people and I wish them well."}
{"text":"The place is clean and friendly. Cons are the food is too expensive for what you get. I don't think the fish and chips are that good in taste, especially for the price."}
{"text":"We ordered the cod, chicken fingers for delivery. Probably better if we had eaten in the restaurant. We'll do that before judging."}
{"text":"Being an east coast girl and recently having fish and chips in Hawaii, you can say I've been spoiled and can spot a frozen-fried fish from a mile away. Living in the desert you kind of get used to the fact that you have to travel to the coast if you want fresh seafood... Up until now.   We stopped in for lunch and you can say, we're definitely hooked! The fish n chips were by far the BEST we've had in Vegas!! The coleslaw, the fries, the beer battered onion rings and the Fish, all fresh and sooo delish!! It's now on our restaurant rotation list and go-to spot for fish & chips!    Fresh food, clean kitchen and environment, friendly staff.. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a strip mall just walking distance from where I live. It joins a couple other highly rated Yelp restaurants in this same strip mall, KoMex and Baby Stacks. Talk about an all-star location! I went on in on a Friday evening during the dinner rush. The place is small but packed that evening. The restaurant itself is nothing memorable but it's simple and clean. There was only one person doing both the serving and as cashier (she did do a good job holding everything together; excellent customer service too). The only other person was the cook/chef. I went on a Friday because I heard they only serve clam chowder that day and I had heard good stuff about it. I was not disappointed in the chowder. Great flavor and consistency. It was served along with bread, toasted on one side, and seasoned. It paired nicely with the chowder. I ordered one of the smaller servings of fish and chips. The fish portions were pretty decent. Thick cod in golden brown batter that wasn't too greasy. The fries were okay and the tartar sauce served its purpose adding a little bit of flavor to the very mildly flavored cod and batter. I'm definitely coming back. Especially because they are so close. I'll be honest, I have not tried any other fish and chips locations here yet to really compare to. I may update this review at a later time."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here. I wasn't sure what I was going to eat as I only eat planet based. I was surprised to learn that had Vegan options. The food was good but the service was soso so that is the reason for my 3 star."}
{"text":"Nice clean and great staff. The food was awesome the fish was so good it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"VEGAN FISH & CHIPS!!! wild.... i was more than satisfied. the vegan menu here is great bc they're a ton of different things from burgers & pizza to vegan desserts. Im definitely coming back to try more. Also the vegan ranch here was soooo good and i was surprised at how much i liked it bc im picky abt any ranch. My dad also enjoyed his nonvegan food too! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend.  Being from the eastcoast it has been difficult finding a good seafood place.  Unfortunately,  I found the fish and chips to have dark greasy taste.  Overcooked or need to change the oil.  This was over a month or so ago.  It was later in the evening.  We'll come back and try again.."}
{"text":"Great service from Dan and the food was really good my friend and I will be back for sure. The plus for me was the meyer lemons on the side lol thanks Dan ;)"}
{"text":"Rockin!! Having grown up near the ocean, I'm picky about seafood! Off the hook is truly off the hook!! Had delicious grilled mahi tacos and my compadre had the premium fish n chips!"}
{"text":"I tried the vegan po boy... no complaints verrrry delicious. The owner is extremely nice! I also tried the fish tacos which were plain/dry to me. The vegan tartar sauce is amazing! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"If you love fish and chips then you would really enjoy their vegan fish and chips. The meatball sub was really good too, however I didn't like the cheese so next time I would do without cheese. The vegan deep fried Oreos was a nice dessert. Staff was helpful and pleasant too."}
{"text":"Great quality seafood, light crispy batter, fried right. Good service. 2nd visit was as good as the first. This is by far the best fish & chips I've had in town and top three anywhere. You must try it."}
{"text":"Super good quality Pacific Alaskan cod fish; crispy batter with flakey white fish; delicious! Excellent service also to enjoy the best fish and chips in Las Vegas! Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have tried fish & chips all over town and this is the best.  It is far for us, but worth it.   Do not get lobster roll unless you want fake lobster."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, after a friend suggested it. The fish and chips is the best we have ever tasted. The fresh cod in beer batter, it was absolutely amazing!! Save room for dessert...the deep fried cheesecake with vanilla bean ice cream was another amazing favorite! This is definitely a hidden gem. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips spot. Fish is great. If you want the old English type food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Quick service great food and good for Vegans the Vegan Ranch my daughter said is excellent and they make it there in house.  I had the cod fish and chips last time tonight I'm trying the cod fish sandwich and there's daily specials tonight is s shrimp Po Boy for $9.99."}
{"text":"Amazing food.. We tried the cauliflower with a kick, fish tacos and mahi mahi fries.. the Thai sauces are pleasantly different..  quality of the dishes are spot on..  I would certainly look to stop in again if I were in the area.."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that yes, it's kind of expensive. But you absolutely get what you pay for. We had two of the medium orders of the cod (2 pieces each but they threw in an extra half piece with each order) with fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw is fantastic and so are the fries; they're super crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. The cod was especially good! They're huge pieces of fish and really meaty. And I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce but it was tangy and delicious. We also ordered a grilled cheese for the kiddo and it was huge! For dessert we ordered the fried cheesecake with blackberry and strawberry sauce and it was awesome! The vanilla ice cream rounded it out perfectly. They also had Coke AND Pepsi products so everyone wins!  The service was fantastic as well. We were informed that they've just changed ownership and may be opening on Sunday and/or Monday to bring in more customers... I hope they do! The owner was incredibly friendly and helpful. He also gave us a card and told us we could call in our order the next time if needed. I'm hoping this restaurant gets some recognition and stays in business because it's a new family favorite!"}
{"text":"Great fish ,Cajun fries crispy where very good. Nice little place in a strip mall. The owner Dan is very personable and takes the time to get to know you and even cleans the salt and pepper shakers on the tables. He keeps the restaurant very clean and neat. We will be back even though it means driving across town."}
{"text":"traaaaaaaaaash. boxed bought fish. trash. and they have the nerve to charge what they charge. i wanted to dispute it , the food was so trash."}
{"text":"Dan is the owner and such a nice person, really great customer service. That being said.....the food is a cut way above standard fish and chips. Everything is so fresh and delicious. The breading is light and crunchy, just perfect. Freshest Cole slaw I've ever had, like home made and not over saturated with mayonnaise. The French fries tasted like fresh potatoes as they should, thick and really good. I have nothing negative to say, it's all good. Dan made Clam Chowder for the menu, a new item when we walked in. He gave me a sample...it was as good as any New Engand Chowder I have had and I'm from there so when I say it was good....it is.  Even if this location is out of the way, it is well worth the few extra miles. I highly recommend this great restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"They are under new ownership and took over about 5 months ago. That means they have different hours and actually open daily unlike the last owners.    This was my first visit here, and the decor is fresh, very fitting to the theme and pleasantly clean.    My husband and I shared the mixed plate. It came with 2 shrimp, 3 pcs of the cod+ 1 smaller pc for yelp check-in, 2 scallopp pcs, all over a bed of fries.   The star was definitely the large pieces of white cod meat covered in a thin layer of crispy batter.  The food came out fresh and fast, and I was really impressed with the thin layer of batter.    The dipping sauces like tartar, cocktail sauce for the shrimp along with vinegar and ketchup for the fries were all delicious.  If I had to complain, I like my fries a little more well done to get that crisp. Either way, we devoured that dish and it was perfect for sharing.    Overall, fresh seafood makes excellent fried food.  The beautiful white meat from the cod is super tender and easily worth the $18 price tag."}
{"text":"Tried the place out and all though the fish was cooked perfectly, I'm not a huge fan of the batter. I prefer beer battered fish. The tarter sauce was also very bland, had no flavor to it. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions and great service. Place is very kids friendly. We got walk on d plank which comes with 2 fish n chips, 2 chicken strips and fries. Also got lobster roll and mahi fish platter which had fries, mahi and thai sauce. It was out of the world. Would highly recommend it. Place is very kids family. Also got fried calamari and fried mushroom for appetizers. All in all good flavorful food at very reasonable price. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are AMAZING here.Also the Fish&Chips are tender and flavorful.When coming here got to try them! 5 Stars Here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my fav place for many reasons. The food is amazing i usually order the cod fish or lobster roll. The service is exceptional and over all dinning expirence is great. I have tried most of the menu and everything i have ordered is delicious. My family will continue to visit everytime we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"my 2nd time here.. I was here awhile ago  I left a review.. my last review I had put about the tartar sauce being very mayonnaisey..no flavor..and still is the same..the owner replied back and was going to check on it... I feel with such a good quality of cod..which was great ..u should make sure u have a equally good paired tartar sauce.. especially with the prices..which i dont mind paying if everything is equally made to perfection..tartar sauce should have lots of lemon juice..sweet pickle relish..very finely grated onion and fresh dill..cole slaw has no flavor but mayonaise ..and to the owner or whoever the chef is I read some reviews..about ur tartar sauce..u said u guys make it in house..I think I would just say u buy it like that..if ur a true chef u wouldn't serve such crappie sauce..u really should use my recipe in this review.. guess people dont know good slaw either..if guess u guys are big on mayonaise overload. .also this time ordered the jumbo shrimp..it's actually jumbo batter..the shrimp was tiny..it's was all batter..u couldn't even taste the shrimp..its like at long John silvers where everything is made with the same batter..and everything taste the same..and other thing if dining in..when u move ur chair at anytime it's so loud and annoying..easy fix..go to home Depot put those little tabs on bottom of legs of chairs..there's so much competition with places to eat in vegas..these are little fixes that make a huge difference..then ur place would be a gem and worth ur prices..."}
