{"text":"The is probably the worst hamburger I've ever had. It's so salty that I can still feel it in my gums a day later.  To prove that is not an isolated incident, my buddy ordered the fish burger and he had the same over overdose of salt as me.  To confirm the point, the place is always empty.   Stay away at all cost."}
{"text":"Little lot diner is a must try!  I had the Philly cheesesteak it was AMAZING! Fresh ingredients & super soft bun!! The rosemary fries are to die for, nothing like them anywhere!  Beautiful decor, clean, friendly staff. Great prices & big portions.  You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"SOLID cheeseburger. Absolutely delicious, drippy and fatty and just fantastic. Very good fries too. They do quality sourcing here- locally baked things and Sought x Found, a class new roaster on Centre St just north of downtown, for coffee. Wealth of local beer to boot.  Have now been 3x and it gets better and better. Second last visit had the spicy fried chicken sandwich which was just too damn delicious so last time enquired about it and it was a daily special not regular menu item but lovely PBTC asked kitchen and they said they'd improvise but would have to use chicken fingers- well it WORKED just beautifully, 'twas simply perfection and I'd eat this one every damn day. The use of chicken fingers instead of a breast \"patty\" meant more crispy surface. MAKE THIS A REGULAR MENU ITEM PLEASE!"}
