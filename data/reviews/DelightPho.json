{"text":"Great little place.  It was my first time having pho and the waiter was very helpful.  Not being very experienced I can't say whether it was comparably good or not but I can say that I will be back again.  Very clean and welcoming environment.  I felt comfortable and am looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little, clean, modern pho place. The menu is shorter than what would commonly be found at pho places, but it had what we were looking for. The fresh rice rolls were indeed fresh and the large pho bowl came with ample noodles and meat.  We tried the shrimp roll along with the beef and the seafood pho. We enjoyed all of it. The sprouts, lime etc were also fresh. Service was friendly, timely and attentive. It looks like they also do a fair bit of takeout, as many people came in for orders while we were there.   I'd go there again.  Due to the less intimidating menu and the clean modern atmosphere, this would be a good place to send someone who is accustomed to typical western restaurants but wants to try food from a different culture."}
{"text":"By far the nicest, most comfortable Pho spot I have ever been to! Like first date kind of nice. 

Delight Pho really goes out of their way to bring Vietnamese cuisine to new level in a number of ways:

*the atmosphere is neutral as there was basketball playing on Tv with 90s-00s hip hop.
*covers pairing chopsticks to avoid other people touching utensils you will use
*really focusing on presentation and proper garnish on dishes. 
*making their own creative touches to classics such as crispy beef being an option in a bowl

All of this while being still competitive on price and taste with other more established Pho restaurants. I only went with wonton soup while a mate got a vermicelli dish. Both of us walked out more than happy with plans to come back for more; goal will be to try their pho to see how they stack up with others.

 I just hope the neighbourhood takes them as Brampton is already a very rough market for small restaurants, especially considering the demographics of the neighbourhood are not in their favor.

Ps: park at the back of the lot near the IDA to avoid any headaches. The grocery store was a terrible pick for a parking lot this small in this area."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant located in a very busy and small plaza. You'd need to dodge cars squeezing through and fight for parking spots. 

The decor of the place is very modernized and bright which didn't give off a \"pho store\" vibe, their menu is very simply and short I guess to cater quick service because if you know typical pho stores has pages and pages of food, I believe DelightPho had 4-5? 

I got the Banh Canh Do Bien, I thought the soup base would be thick because that's how typical Banh canh is in Vietnam but this came out like a normal soup with fish balls in it. The soup tasted great but you can tell that the fish balls were store brought. Nothing too wow about this dish. 

My mom got the Bun Bo Hue and she didn't really enjoy it. The type of meat they used is typically found in a dish called Bo Kho and there wasn't any pork hock in the dish which didn't feel like it was authentic. She ended up picking out pieces of beef because she said the texture was too soft and turned her off. 

Authentic Vietnamese food? No. Quick place to get a bite? Yes. Will someone hit your car while you eat? Quite possibility"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. Love the food. Satay beef was good. Grilled chicken was grilled properly and still maintained to be juicy. The fresh shrimp rolls tasted fresh and light. They don't shy away from meat portions. I would definitely go back again and I have. Portion size is appropriate to price. The place is in a small plaza though. I recommend parking far. The service is good too. Happy to have this Vietnamese restaurant present in an area dominated by multiple Indian restaurants."}
