{"text":"Awesome food that's ready in no time. Great pizza and salads. Really trendy."}
{"text":"The salads are good although a little cheap on the salad side considering the price, A little more mesclune mix would improve them. Coffee is quite good."}
{"text":"The Holly Trinity of Eatery Reviews: Atmosphere, Service, Food  Atmosphere: Anton & James (AJ) is a beautiful place to sit down or grab a bite on the go.  Situated on Stanley St (between De Maisonneuve and St. Catherine streets) - it does a great job of being in the mix of it all, but yet retain a type of clean urban look.  The place can get a little crowded at lunch time and dinner, and it does not have abundant seating - but despite this, the decor is such that it allows all patrons to seamlessly intertwine without getting (too much) in each other's way.  There is a long Granite table on the top floor that's perfect for evening gatherings with friends.  Love the set up.  Service:  The people at AJ's are very very professional.  Through my dinning experience in Montreal, I've come to learn that AJ's is owned / run by the same people that own Ruben's Deli(s) on St. Catherine's Street, and one of the hallmarks of Ruben's is professional service - this has certainly been translated to AJs.  Pay for your food, and they will give you a number (on a stand), and a waiter, waitresses, or sometimes even the manager will bring the food to you - upstairs, downstairs, or even outside (in the summer time).   Food:  If end up liking AJ's atmosphere and service - you'll come back for the food!  The menu is limited (but expanding slowly) and mainly consists of several types of grilled panini sandwiches - You absolutely MUST try the chicken chipotle - MUST.  Everything is made fresh, and if you order a pizza (good for 1 & 1/2 people), it's made from absolute scratch.  There are usually 2-3 soups of the day ready and hot, and AJ's provides a wide selection of beverages and packaged salads if you're on the go.   They have an absolutely divine deserts counter - that will certainly become a guilty pleasure.  Carrot Cake Muffin, all the way.  Prices are reasonable if a little on the \"not cheap\" side - but you certainly get you're money's worth - and that's what counts.  Big fan ~ urban chic."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch occasionally, whenever I am craving a pizza that is good, yet cheaper than a sit down restaurant.  You can either buy pret-a-manger items or you can order something from their menu (pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, paninis...etc).  I have tried a few of their choices and would recommend any of their pizzas.  For sandwiches I recommend the wild mushroom and goat cheese.  Very delicious for being a vegetarian option.  They have a small seating area upstairs and if you order for here they hand you a number and when the foods ready they will bring it to you wherever you are.  As others have stated, it is a trendy place.  I find the sandwiches and paninis to be a bit overpriced, but the pizzas are at a decent price point."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill in the recent years. I was there for a meeting and I was not very impressed with the cleanliness of this place. my colleagues and I had to go somewhere else because everything was disgusting and we would not want to put any of that food in our mouths. We definitely don't recommend it if you want to stay healthy."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the steak and mustard wrap, but it's heavy so made it two meals. Delicious mushroom pizza, the cold deli items are also tasty. Wasn't as big a fan of the chicken noodle soup, but everything else has been excellent. I look forward to gradually trying everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"It's the go-to place for a good lunch  Although a bit pricey, it is often worth it, the food is fresh and flavorful and made on the spot rather then brought over from some factory.   Never disappointed by anything i've eaten there - but their Pizzas are the best. Thin and crispy and the ingredients are simple fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Anton & James est un incontournable pour les habitués du centre-ville de Montréal et je le recommande fortement aux gens de passage. À un prix relativement peu élevé, il est possible d'y manger un repas savoureux et frais.  Au menu, une bonne dizaine de pizzas cuites sur place, des salades créatives et fraîches, des sandwichs savoureux, un filet de saumon ou une poitrine de poulet avec accompagnement.  Le restaurant est d'une propreté impeccable, le service est rapide et souriant.  Par contre, l'endroit est doté d'une minuscule salle à manger au deuxième étage et d'une terrasse sur la rue à peine plus grande durant la belle saison. Un conseil : si la température si prête, allez plutôt manger votre plat au carré Dorchester, à un jet de pierre."}
{"text":"Ate the PEP pizza and it was yummy.  Just what my tummy needed.  Set upstairs looking down at street"}
{"text":"Alright, that Mustard and Honey Glazed Steak Wrap was the bomb.  Oh my goodness, that steak was so tender and the seasoning was so on point, that I just want to keep on eating that until I hate myself.  Seriously, even my girlfriend who hates eating beef said that tasted amazing.  I had the Anise Lemonade, and I hate anise drinks. I'd appreciate it if they can label or indicate to the customers somehow that the lemonade was flavoured with spices, and it was slightly overpriced, too.  Besides that, I will come back regularly to ingurgitate that wrap and feast on their delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Friendly place and good for lunch breaks and evenings when u r not into making dinner! Make sure you try the roast beef The staff are very nice by the way"}
{"text":"Over the years, I have visited Anton & James quite a few times. The location is, without any doubt, extremely convenient - It is a great restaurant to visit when you are in a hurry and are looking for a good fast-food restaurant downtown. Their food is, also, quite better than what other fast-food chains offer!  However, every time I visit the banner, I somehow feel a little ripped off. Yes, their food is good, fresh. Yes, the quality of the ingredients is a gazillion times better than what you would find at your local Golden Arches. However, I am one of those who cannot help but frown a little when they have to pay more than 20$ in a fast food restaurant.   Last time i visited A&J, I opted for the Mediterranean Pizza, which was satisfying and prepared with fresh veggies, feta and basil. The taste was good, but never as impressive as anything I could have tasted in a true Italian restaurant for the same price.   A friend of mine with which I visited this place told me that it reminded her of an \"Airport cafeteria\". Somehow, I cannot disagree."}
{"text":"Went to Anton's after a long awaited year and had an inside out grilled cheese. It was sooo good! Crispy, buttery, cheesy, delicious. While I was there I could not believe what I witnessed! The most disrespectful, arrogant customer I have every seen. Belittling a waitress for not speaking French to his caliber, calling her names and asking for his order to be remade. When she came back with his new pizza he kept up the complaints. She left crying, when the owner came to see him he handled the situation like a pro, as the client kept up his banter the owner stated that he has re-made his order 3 times, compensated him; but once he was done, if he would please not come back to his establishment. It was refreshing to see an owner stand up for his employees. He also personally came to apologize to my sister and I for the disruption. Mad respect for the food, the workers, and owners!"}
{"text":"Skip this one. Sloppy sandwich which I could not eat due to sauce splurting everywhere. Depressing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like to refer to this place as an urban cafeteria because you can literally walk in, grab something out of the fridge, and walk out (after paying, of course).  A&J offer ready- made sandwiches and salads, pastries, AND hot meals. If you're not in a hurry and don't mind waiting/eating at the resto, then you can go ahead and order from the vast menu of hot items such as panini or pizza. They have a small sitting area upstairs, as well as a small terrasse outside.   Their mushroom pizza is to die for (roasted Portobello, Shitake and Porcini mushrooms + fresh basil, garlic and Fontina + Mozzarella cheese. The dough is just the right consistency - not too thick, delectably soft and oh-so-tasty.   I usually opt for one of their salads when I'm grabbing lunch on the go; I've tried most of their offerings and enjoy them all - the portion is just right for me, unlike Chop Crazy or Fabrika who make HUGE salads you just can't finish.  I've also tried their sandwiches, which are made fresh on the spot. My favorites include: Under the Tuscan Sun (Grilled chicken breast, tomatos, red onions, greens, provolone and pesto mayo on Rosemary focaccia) and the WIld Mushroom & Goat Cheese (roasted Portobello, Shitake and Porcini mushrooms, tomatos, greens, garlic aioli sauce on Ciabatta bread.   Overall, you can't go wrong here.  Whether you're looking for a carb fix or trying to eat healthy - if you're looking for fresh food to go, this is the place to get it. Oh, and they now offer breakfast items too!"}
{"text":"Chicken Cesar salad wrap is the best one I've ever had in my life.  I've been coming to get my wraps since I was 16 from here and I've yet to find a better one.  I wish it was open right now I would be there with a huge smile lol."}
{"text":"Great spot for quick sandwiches, salads, soups and pizza!!!! They have some delicious fresh juice and pastries ;) recommended for a nice casual lunch or lunch on the go"}
{"text":"I've been to this place numerous times. Usually, it's when I don't feel like waiting in line downtown for decent food. Although the pizza here isn't baked in a wood-fired oven, it's still awesome. I usually order the tomato-basil or chipotle chicken pizza. Otherwise, it's the tuscan grilled chicken sandwich.  No matter what I order, the ingredients are fresh and the food super flavorful. You just can't go wrong here. There's even a TV upstairs to watch the hockey game while enjoying the great food, and the service is excellent!  Trust me, you need to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I tried the pizza and it is delicious but my favourite is the turkey on toasted grain with pear and cranberry relish!!! When I'm craving a soup I grab one on the way home!  All the food is delicious, it is what your are craving at that moment!"}
{"text":"There's not too much seating in the restaurant, but most of the food they serve is more for takeout anyways. I personally got a mushroom pizza, and though I initially felt apprehensive about the price, it was worth it in my eyes. The pizza was subtle, well seasoned and had plenty of toppings. I shared it with someone, so I didn't fill me up, but I didn't mind my tongue was satisfied."}
{"text":"If I lived/worked nearby, I would be a regular here. Like an almost everyday regular.  I had a standard pizza - mozz, tomatoes, basil. It was perfectly crisp, not too thin, not too thick, and the basil was fresh and delicious. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food. There was a nice clean dining space upstairs where the whole family could sit around a table. YUM!"}
{"text":"An urban cafeteria in the center of downtown Montreal. The restaurant is conveniently located off of St. Catherine street.  Their PEP pizza is one of my favorites to eat in on a stool watching the shoppers go by. Loaded with pepperoni and the right amount of cheese, the pizza is heat in their ovens and comes out piping hot in minutes.   If I need a lunch to grab 'n go - They have a large selection of wraps and sandwiches.  My personal fav is the Azteca Chicken wrap. Great when it's toasted warm."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh here and everything but the salads are prepared on the spot. Not to say that the salads aren't great, because they are. It's got a cafeteria/sandwich shop vibe, but they also make great pizza. The trick is that they prepare everything themselves and use great ingredients. I will definitely be returning to try more items on the menu.  For the price of a sandwich, you would maybe expect a side with it as well or a drink, but it's to be expected when everything is this fresh. Plus, I don't REALLY need that much food anyhow."}
{"text":"I've gotten to the point where I tend to just roll my eyes when someone says a pizza place is good (Montreal has the world's best bread and cheese but for some reason can't puzzle out how to put them together in a pizza configuration) but we needed somewhere near the movie theatre that wasn't the food court so gave this little place a try.   As described, it's a take-out/small eat-in semi-cafeteria feel with high end products and ingredients. The pizza was fresh, made fast and high quality (yay for good ricotta!). Their homemade chipotle oil was a hit and we had an overly sweet but still yummy smoothie.  Amazing? No? Thoroughly worth the visit before a movie, quality, served with a smile and pretty damn good for Montreal pizza? Yep."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and quick service. This is more of a relaxed lunch spot than a place to take a date. Orders are placed downstairs and delivered upstairs. That's the extent of your service. Then diners bus their own plates. The pizza is extremely good. Relatively thin crust with a good bite, fresh cheese and the perfect amount of sauce. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You know those weekday mornings where it's gross and rainy and cold outside, and all you can do is think about how warming and delightful lunch will be? So you head out to find the perfect place, but you can't find anything, and instead end up with some overpriced salad that's 99% lettuce and 1% miscellaneous. Well, if you had gone to Anton & James, you wouldn't be in this mess.   I've only tried their pre-made lunches with chicken/salmon, veg and a potato puree, but I'm telling you... this is exactly what you need if you need a little pick me up. Sure, it's oily and buttery and probably not the healthiest thing under the sun, but I can promise that after finishing this meal, you will be happy as a clam at high tide.   They also have sandwiches and pizzas on the menu which, judging by these other meals, I'm sure are fantastic."}
{"text":"It's lunch time; I'm hungry (obviously); I want something fresh, something tasty, something fast, some food that isn't fried, etc.; Anton & James is where you'll find me.  I love to go to AJ to grab my lunch (and dinner sometimes too!).  They have :   - Great chunky salads (try the Urban Salad in combo with Renée's raspberry salad dressing, or the Greek Salad in combo with Renée's Mediterranean dressing),      - Massive wraps and sandwiches which you can personalize by adding extra ingredients (careful though, as they use fresh and bio ingredients, each additional item is a bit pricey),    - A variety of basic but oh so savory pizzas,   - Warm meals, such as roasted chicken with veggies,   - And very yummy (and quite big) muffins.  A relatively new venue here in Montreal, this urban cafeteria is awesome for take out or dine-in, for lunch or dinner... and snack time!"}
{"text":"A real urban pizzeria, love the set up, love the food.  A small fast food type eatery where you order your food beforehand and pay for your food beforehand and they'll bring it to you when it's ready. Main floor has lots of quick snacks and prepackaged meals if you're on the go, like soups, salads, fruit cups, juice blends..  Their pizzas are prepared and heated fresh for you, only complaint is that their pepperoni is extremely salty.  They have a bunch of sandwiches and wraps - i love the chicken cesar one. Portions are decent, but prices a bit high. They also serve smoothies which look like a small cup and charge 4$ - I could get a much bigger gulp elsewhere that's for sure...  Antone and James is a trendy place, you really feel like you're living the downtown experience when you eat upstairs, facing the window where you can people watch."}
{"text":"Anton and James is the home of the best pizza I've ever had - the Dolce Vita. No, my favorite pizza doesn't come from a fancy Italian restaurant but from an urban cafeteria across Peel metro station. The crust is not too thick not too thin. It's rather a happy medium that shuttles near perfect toppings. I only wished that the chicken was less on the dry side but the overall taste of the pizza makes up for that.   The service is quick, making Anton and James an excellent stop for a fast and satisfying lunch. I've tried other items on the menu but the Dolce Vita is the definitely a must try."}
{"text":"After a day of hiking up Mont Royal, and having an unsettled stomach all day, all I wanted was a sandwich stop somewhere near my hotel in the downtown area.  I know, what a waste to want (need) a non-greasy, cold sandwich when you're traveling a new town and the town happens to be  a foodie's playground.    Well, Anton & James is not such a bad place to have had a meal at all.  I got a turkey sandwich on the rosemary bread.  It was so good!  It's open late for downtown on a Monday (I'd guess 10pm or so?), and it's right between Maisonnueve and Bell Centre.... off of Rue Stanley.  Safe area, and nice people-watching if you choose to sit in the stools that face the street window.  They also had a clear case displaying their pastries and breads (where you can help yourself to, and then take to the counter to pay), and they looked fantastic.  And quite unique, but without looking like a toothache in the making.  I would have tried one, but remember?  Unsettled stomach?    Price was decent at around $7 or so for a sandwich that was not small nor huge.  I can't remember right now, but I think it came with a salad?  Maybe not.  They serve espresso as well, if you'd like."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. I was craving a wrap and searched through downtown until I found Anton & James. The folks working at AJ were very helpful. I asked about many of the items on their menu and they took time to pleasantly explain the ingredients. I eventually ordered the Tuscan sandwich converted to a wrap. Very tasty.  The prices are decent and I like how  you have the option to take ready-made food to go or have it made fresh. AJ has plenty of good seats along the windows so that you can people watch along Rue Stanley.  The only downside is that it costs $6 to add chicken to their veggie wraps. That seems really excessive considering that you can buy a cooked rotisserie chicken from Costco for less than $6.   At any rate, I'd recommend AJ for good food, service, location, and prices."}
{"text":"I work & go to school downtown and let's be honest, there are very few places where you can grab good/quick food to go. Anton & James has been my go to place for years and it never disappoints. It is literally a cafeteria with quality food. A bit on the pricey end- but oh so worth it. The salads are amazing- my favorite is the good old Chicken Caesar. The pizzas are also really yummy. And they even have good hot meals. You pick your meal, drink, desert (I recommend the macadamia chocolate cookie) and you take it to go or eat it there while people watching. Try it!"}
{"text":"J'adore leurs cafés et muffins, toujours une belle alternative aux chaînes de restauration. j'ai essayé une fois leurs repas préparés d'avance et c'était super bon. Je conseil fortement cet endroit!!"}
