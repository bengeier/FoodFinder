{"text":"No knife with the silverware is routine. Place seems and feels and looks dirty. I'm willing to cut some slack on food that is mass produced but this is my 2nd time there and hopefully my last. Tonight was a bad meal made only palatable by store bought sherbet and a store bought cookie."}
{"text":"They have a wild selection of food, but most of them are not very fresh. It just doesn't taste good. I won't go back if they don't make any changes."}
{"text":"All these review had me not wanting to come here.  But the food was better than I had expected.  They have a good selection and things were fresh. I was surprised it was busy for lunch but it is roomy enough that it didn't matter.  Price was very reasonable and parking was easy."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Some things were undercooked. Some things were WAY overcooked. The pineapple chicken was like chewing on a stick of beef jerky. My jaw got sore chewing... I would not feed this to my dogs and they eat their own shit. To top that off they are EXTREMELY over priced for the quality of food, not top mention the lack of English speaking personnel that couldn't understand basic words and just stare at you when you ask for something.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food here. They've got a large selection of Chinese and American food along with a good variety of seafood and sushi. Great prices and the quality is pretty tasty for a buffet."}
{"text":"Service is ok!  But the food  is horrible. ..yuk!!! That is not sushi!  I tried to get some of the ginger and it was frozen.  HORRIBLE! ! I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS DUMP AGAIN"}
{"text":"Solid buffet. Great selection, good quality food, lots of seafood options, hibachi, and very tolerable sushi. For a buffet."}
{"text":"Despite the Italian decor leftover from the previous business,  this place is great. Sushi selection is extensive, Mongolian bar is good, and selection is decent. The service is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I've eaten Chinese buffets for many years in New York, Boston, and now in Pittsburgh and I have to say this is a good one.  Excellent Chinese dishes, superb soups including my favorite miso soup, decent and fresh sushi, a good selection of deserts and fruit.  For the price, superb.  And the good number of Oriental customers indicates that the most discriminating diners think that it's a great place as well.  Overall, I'm very, very satisfied each time I come here...which is always lunch time at peak hours (peak hours are the only time anyone should visit a buffet). They seem to have an ample section of what a friend of mine calls \"PIttsburgh food\" (unhealthy fried foods, cheese filled foods, etc) which I simply ignore but which the big-butted among us seem to crave.  So you'll have Pittsburgh food options if you're not really into Chinese but it's the Chinese food that's the star. Otherwise, the restaurant is a bit faded and would need a face lift to have that Shadyside bistro look...but all I care about is the food.  And it's good and a great value."}
{"text":"OLD AND COLD.       JUST DON'T.  The place is crap now.  It used to be decent, but something happened.  Now the food is COLD and just looking at it, looks like they made it 2 days ago.  Its obvious these jerks are just trying to save money.  Even after I complained, they gave me a ONE DOLLAR discount.  An insult..  We couldnt eat most of the food, so we shouldnt have had to pay most of the price.  Don't waste your money here.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"The lack of a working public restroom and the unenthusiastic chef who barely cooked my food on the hibachi really killed the vibe here. I was genuinely scared to eat the shrimp, but also scared of wasting the plate he made due to the wasted food overcharging policy.Otherwise, their selection isn't bad. Their house chicken is really good and also their Italian chicken in their American food area. They had a decent selection of sushi."}
{"text":"Ate there twice food was average if you dont feel like cooking its the place to be..I like the fried shrimp..mussels.. crab ragoon too..and not to mention sushi is decent...veggies are good...damn it its all good"}
{"text":"Website states they have a sushi bar.  When i got there at 11:50am for lunch, they only have rolls with veggies.  When i asked the manager, she said only at dinner.  No where on their website does it say sushi is only on the buffet at night for dinner.  False advertising."}
{"text":"We've been to a lot of Chinese buffets around pittsburgh.  The sushi is ok recommend cutting down on variety to move it faster which makes it fresher. The white rice can have hard bits in it. The coconut shrimp is usually cold,  not clear what the issue is with steam tables. The rest is ok if you're not picky like me. But then my boyfriend won't go back and he likes everything.  Cannot comment on any meats other than fish. I don't eat other meats. Good place for kids or people who don't go out to eat much. Not a bad price. Try robinson Chinese buffet much better"}
{"text":"The food is very good. The atmosphere? Oh dear lord!  At one booth a guy was telling his date about being an gang banger, other groups near us never took their hats or coats off and kept staring at our daughter. Others were very loud and used crude talk. We honestly felt like we were in a soup kitchen. Not sure why we were put in the back. We shower and clean up nice when we go out to dinner. The low cost probably attracts transients.  As cheap and good as this meal was, I can't go back. Could not enjoy my dinner.  We all lost our appetites."}
{"text":"Food is decent. A lot of items are cold.  Staff is rude. They just stand in the corner and stare at you and whisper. I like the variety of food they have at least."}
{"text":"We went at around 8 on a Monday night, which I guess is outside of peak hours. The \"town\" on the neon sign had burnt out, which we should've taken as a sign. Everything was old and disgusting. As per usual at local Chinese buffets, there was a bunch of fried Americana crap, like chicken nuggets and mozzarella sticks. Stuff that belongs nowhere near a Chinese restaurant. But that I can excuse. I got some dumplings. They were cold and had obviously been sitting out for quite some time. The General tso's chicken was disgusting. As was literally everything else. I barely touched anything else because everything just looked sad sitting there on the buffet like it hadn't been touched or looked at in hours. Not just that, but the soda fountains were spitting out disgusting tasteless, flat soda. Also it's grossly overpriced at $12 per person, when honestly they should pay you. Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised with Old Town Buffet. The staff was friendly and the food was good! The sushi was just alright which I expected as much for a buffet. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it was in Century 3. When it moved closer to me, I was so excited to not have to drive all that way down Route 51. However, when I visited this location, I felt they skimped on quality; it just wasn't the same. The facility itself is very large with plenty of food options and plenty of seating. Although there's plenty of food choices, none that I tried were all that great. The owners should also probably update the decor, as it's still very reminiscent of the old Italian restaurant that inhabited this building before. So you're eating Chinese food in a place that has Italian cookbooks on the shelves. A little weird. Also, when I went here, it was a few weeks after Christmas and they had a playlist of different versions of \"The Christmas Song\" playing over and over again. I wonder if they didn't think we'd notice??"}
{"text":"If you're thinking about dining here, you might want to think again. The place is huge and there is a wide variety of dishes but none were very good. I had the worst California roll I've ever eaten. The food was either too bland, overcooked, or had too much fish sauce. The only food we did like was that which was purchased by the restaurant (ice cream, cake, cookies).  We went on a Saturday night at 7, but there were very few people there. Of course with all the different rooms it was hard to tell. The place used to be an Italian restaurant and none of the decor has been changed, including the pictures on the walls. The large booths have crumbling vinyl and the place smells like a nursing home with a fish market next door.  For $15 a person and really expensive drinks its not worth it, unless you're really strapped for time and don't care what you eat. Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really did not like this place. Though the prices are low, in my opinion, it is not worth it. As other reviewers have stated, the food was not heated as thoroughly as it should have been. Everything I had was average at best, and I don't remember anything sticking out or leaving me thinking to myself that I had to get more. What I disliked the most, however, was the service. All the staff I encountered was unfriendly. Waitstaff was inattentive and barely came to check on my table. The worst part was when a waitress presented the check, she pointed to the bottom and said, \"here is suggested tip amount\". I felt that was rude and unprofessional. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of food! Their food are always super dry. This would be my 4th time here, always giving them a another chance because it was so convenient. My husband, a friend, and I wanted something to eat real Quick before dropping my friend off tonight. So we decided to eat here because it was close by. Picture are deceiving. If you go early when they first open, it probably look like that but we were there at 7 and it doesn't close till 10..the food were super dry and they weren't refilling the food. I know it's only $14 a person but I'd rather pay an extra $5 and go to Hokkaido by the waterfront. Felt sick and really regret wasting my appetite here. Never again!"}
{"text":"Chinese/Japanese food. Overall not bad quality for a buffet. A lot better than the buffets I am used to. Overall not bad quality.   Sushi was OK. Pretty good for a buffet sushi.    If you are going for crab leg, be sure to ask if there is none out.  They are happy to get some out as soon as possible.   Considering it is a buffet, 4 stars is fair.  If it was a regular service place, I'd have to go with a 3 star.    $14.99 for Sunday buffet, includes crab legs."}
{"text":"Not good food was nasty the place was dirty I will never be going back it will be close in know time just like the other ones just nasty"}
{"text":"this is the former Misaki Buffet .  i believe one of the 2 owner/investors wanted out and thus the name change.  there's less sushi than there used to be and no nigiri pieces.  it's all the same American / Americanized-Chinese food on the buffets. A highlight (to me anyway) is the steamed tilapia along the far wall side.  A lot of the rest is just sysco / pre-fabricated re-heated food, clearly ...  it was initially $6.99 but they just raised the lunch (m-f) price to $8.99 as of January, 2016.  I suspect it will continue to rise until they notice people aren't coming as often. To be honest the food is not really worth any more than the current price and you can have the proper real-deal sushi experience at places like \"Oriental Buffet\" on McKnight Road or Hokkaido Buffet in the East end near the Waterfront area.  They are a dollar or 2 more for lunch but are definetly better in quality (and atmosphere)  The problem with this space is that it's the former Tambellini Italian restaurant with all the requisite tacky Italian ristorante old school decor and embellishments.  This gets on my nerves but clearly the new owners are not interested in re-doing the interior.  The lighting can be very dim, too.  Yellow-ish lights . Not particulary conducive to eating fresh food, imo .  You can see that they truck in the kitchen employees all at once from who knows where. I just hope they are being paid fairly and reasonably .   The only reason I patronize this place is that it's very close to where I live . Otherwise i'd head to other area buffets  like The Mintt (Indian food) and the aforementioned places.   On a last note - sorry to be judgemental but you will see a lot of obese urban-types streaming in  .  White black and every other racial persuasion in between.. .  downtrodden, unhealthy looking and annoyingly loud.  It can be off putting . in other words, ghetto idiots coming down the hill from Beltzhoover/Mt. Oliver/Allentown/Carrick/Overbrook & etc slum-hoods ... (there, I said it .)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here last Friday and I have to say I was very impressed. The dining hall itself could use a facelift but it was clean, the waitresses were very friendly and everything seemed to be pretty fresh. The SUSHI WAS UNBELIEVABLY FRESH! It was by far my favorite part! They have a ton of entrees to choose ranging from meats to vegetarian dishes. There were staff constantly replenishing the buffet with fresh hot trays. My least favorite part was the hibachi. (And also cost of the final star) The man assigned simply fried up our selections with no seasoning, no flavor. We had to ask for garlic and butter and it still was bland and just not edible.  We were a bit disappointed by this but remained pleased with the huge variety of other selections to choose from. I am not a fan of going out to eat but my husband and I really enjoyed our first visit and will return again."}
{"text":"The toilet says......God have mercy on their souls, for they know not what they do.  Absolute garbage. Place has a very foul odor to it, not sure if it was the actual place or the low class patrons who frequent here. Service is horrible as well.  Sushi is extremely low quality, and the salmon roll had an extremely fishy smell. All the fried food looked as though it had been sitting there all day. Hibachi was the only redeeming thing here, but takes an eternity because they have one chef for the entire restaurant!!! The food overall was very poor, I did not feel well afterwards.  Save your money and go to an actual chinese restaurant like Sesame Inn or Silk Road. Those establishments ensure your experience and meal are of the highest quality. Old Town Buffet is garbage, plain and simple. I would not recommend this dump to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't know why it just got three stars on Yelp. As far as I know, this is the best Chinese/Cantonese buffet in Pittsburgh, and its price is completely friendly to students. I will recommend this buffet to my friends."}
{"text":"Great selection of food there is something for everyone.  Really different dishes perfect place to try a taste.  Good value for the money.  Will return again"}
{"text":"CLOSED see picture... 'Intent to demolish' sign on the front door when we tried to eat there today."}
{"text":"Very good buffet. I enjoyed the selection. There was a lot of variety. The sushi was good and the sangria bowl was a nice refreshing treat. The almond cookies were delicious. I'll certainly go back I liked this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian buffets in Pittsburgh. The only one better that I can think of is Dynasty Buffet in Cranberry Twp.  A decent selection of OK sushi, normally kept fresh. It's not the greatest but it's also not your typical buffet sushi.  The dimsum is yummy and kept hot, and the entrees are very good, ranging from your expected General Tso's chicken to indian and tepan-style chicken. Steamed crawfish, calamari and many variations on shrimp are among the more unusual dishes.  A selection of soups including some amazing Miso broth with tofu, fresh shallots, and dried seaweed for you to add to your taste. A fresh cold salad selection as well for those interested in such.  A hibachi table rounds out the amazing selection of dinner selections with fresh raw ingredients for you to choose from and a friendly chef to prepare them for you to order.  There is a large selection of fresh fruits, puddings and traditional Asian pastries as well as ice creme in single serving cups and peanut brittle makes for an amazing dissert selection.   The service is always friendly and some of my friends have even called it over-attentive, such as offering drink refills when your cup is only half empty.  The atmosphere is a bit odd as the building used to be an Italian banquet hall and hasn't really been redecorated.  They have two private rooms including one equipped with a PA system and projection screen for business meetings - but you have to call ahead for that.  They don't shirk at large groups... I've shown up with 15 people with only a few minutes notice and they already had tables ready for us."}
{"text":"Ok, I've lowered my 2 star rating to 1 star after meeting a friend at Old Town buffet for lunch recently after a long absence. The selection was still pretty good and the hibachi cooked-to-order is a good choice, but a whole section of the hot buffet, on the far right as you enter, was below serving temperature. Cold \"hot\" foods present a significant food poisoning risk. I'm not willing to risk my health no matter what price they charge; it shouldn't be hard to recognize the importance of keeping the steam tables working properly.  ----------- This place was quite wonderful when it was Misaki, but sadly it has steadily gone downhill since it was renamed Old Town Buffet. The sushi at Misaki was wonderful with a variety of types of recognizable fresh fish, octopus and so forth, now it is just chopped mystery fish with sweet orange or brown sauces liberally squirted all over them. Much though I love sushi, I wouldn't touch any of these. Clams in black bean sauce were few and far between and dried out, as was the fried squid. Service was poor overall and I had to wait 10 minutes for someone to cook my \"hibachi\" plate. I pass by fairly often and there are fewer and fewer cars in the parking lot, even at Friday dinner time; I think people are more often going to the new TJ's Buffet in the North Hills or Hokkaido, both of which have been doing a better job on sushi and freshness overall. If Old Town would work to rebuild their sushi quality and perhaps add dim sum again as Misaki had, I'd gladly eat there as it's more convenient for me, but until then, I'll eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a good location, and the food is what you'd expect from an average American Chinese buffet, but the staff is very nice even though they don't speak much English they will try their best to make sure your satisfied. They listen to your requests and try their best to make it happen. They're takeout is pretty cheap too.   They have a lot of space too so that's a plus you don't feel crowded or rushed. Also there is lots of free parking they have a huge parking lot so its not like places you feel like you have to worry about parking or ticketing (big problem in the burgh btw)  The coconut shrimp is really good! And the fruit is very fresh!"}
{"text":"For a $8.55 (with tax) all you can eat chinese lunch buffet, your expectations have to be pretty low. That being said, for the price, its solid. Food is mediocre (at best) but nothing stood out as unedible. Some things could've been heated up a little more. Id recommend only going for lunch because not only is dinner more, the food tends to be more cold and soggy. The restroom, however, was one of the worst public restrooms iv ever stepped foot in to. The lights way too dim, all urinals backed up, urine on the floor, toilet seats filthy. Sorry for ruining your appetite =p"}
{"text":"My gut said no way to a buffet but I always wanted to see if they kept the awesome bar that was in Tambellini's.  They got rid of the bar and have a very impressive looking buffet set up, in fact if the food was any good it would be an amazing place.  My gut was correct and I will never go back.  This place was horrible.  I don't even know how they can screw up food as bad as they did.  The crabmeat is imitation and I couldn't even get a bite down.  The beef which you cut yourself was as dry as leather from a dead camel in the desert.  The salmon tasted worse than it looked and smelled.  The chicken was edible but I am not sure it was chicken.  Same with the \"pork chops\", they had a very strange taste.  Yes it is \"all you can eat\" but my plates went back full as it was \"all I could not eat\".  I finally scavenged some good mushrooms, some chicken, and added it to the fried rice, lots of salt and I managed to get a plate down.  They advertise Hibachi too, but it is a couple of guys hanging out at a grill waiting to throw whatever you hand them from the mini buffet onto the grill. I must say, the Coke was good and there was plenty of parking.  Confucius say.... no buffet.... stay away. Pretty sure the crawfish come from the crick that runs along Saw Mill Run.  We need a symbol that is not a star at all for this one.  Save yourself!  Run!  Bring back Tambellini's."}
{"text":"A friend of mine loves this place. So I've been dragged here a lot. But honestly I'll never come here by my own choice.  The quality of the food earns it no star. The variety earns it one star. And the price earns it another.  I think I'm only forgiving the quality of the food because of the variety and the price. Most of the food is especially greasy. The fried chicken would have oil dripping from it when you bite on it. The stews are almost just meat soaked in oil. And almost all the sauces are the greasiest versions that I've ever seen. Well it's only 8 dollars for a meal, so I can understand what they're trying to do, but I think most people would prefer something less fatty for a little more money. Also lots of the food taste like it's been sitting there for hours. It's very easy to go wrong. So if you're actually looking to have a nice meal and/or impress someone, don't ever come here. The only place that I feel like I could trust in this place is the grill, because you get to pick your own ingredients, and it wouldn't be too greasy - prob because it's really cheap anyway, so there's no need to stuff you to make you eat less. By the way sushi's famous for filling your stomach after you drink any liquid. So there you go, another trick to fill you up.  The price and the variety are the only reasons I'm giving it a score above the minimum. I don't think there's any other place that gives you salmon and crab and beef and all sorts of stuff for just 8 dollars. They also have salads, soups, fruits, and ice cream with a chocolate fondue. So I guess it still merits an okay score. If you're low on budget but really want to eat some meat (or are just starving so bad that you could eat a horse), then I guess this place is for you.  Overall, in terms of quality of food, this is the worst buffet I've ever been to. (I'm not even judging on the fact that it's Americanized Chinese food, which is a weird existence to me) But I'll give it a 2, since it's also the cheapest buffet I've gone to and has an above average variety."}
{"text":"We have there multiple times with my family, but the last two times, the servers have been extra rude.  We tend to leave a cash tip instead of adding it to our card, as we know servers pay extra on credit tips. But the rude waitress told my father to leave a tip on the card, even after he had put 0 and signed, we had already left at $15 tip cash on the table.  Today she did it again, and I told her she was rude and she nodded and talked to her coworkers in her language. When I asked to speak to the manager, he just nodded, the language barrier,  lack of service etiquette, mediocre cold food is no longer in plans to return."}
{"text":"Never trust a sushi buffet where the rice has enough time to get hard. My wife and I ate there,  every thing was cold. I had to ask for a crab cracker for the cold crab legs and if you're going to serve meat a knife would be nice. To top it all off the waitress grabbed the paid check to look for a tip and gave us a disgusted look before we even got up from the table will never go there again."}
{"text":"I learry rike lice. Dis one numba one!"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice if you're looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet - I mean, where else can you find unlimited sushi, shrimp cocktail, crawfish, clams, hot and sour soup, made-to-order hibachi, strangely delicious green beans, AND breadsticks, all for just $11.99 per person at peak hours (even less for lunch and weekdays)?   Sure, the decor is a little strange for an Asian buffet as they seem to have kept everything from the spot's former Italian restaurant days, but if not redecorating means I get a cheaper meal, then I'm onboard.   The dining room is huge so there is never a wait for seating."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Chinese buffet. The prices are nice, it is always clean and the food is changed out frequently (at least on the weekends, which is when I typically go), and the customer service is excellent.  They have 2 large hot food buffet carts, a MYO hibachi station, a few hot soups, a salad bar, a nice selection of fresh sushi, and a small dessert cart with ice cream and pastries.  My favorites are the crab casserole, General tsos chicken, teriyaki chicken on a stick, sautéed green beans, peel and eat cold shrimp, and the steamed dumplings.  One item I do not like is their seaweed salad. I couldn't get it down.  There are a few other mystery concoctions but otherwise everything looks and tastes great. Typical Americanized Chinese food with authentic staples, and some American food like fried chicken wings and onion rings.   They have a large dining room & also a back room that I believe you can use to host parties. The dining room decor leaves a bit to be desired (it was formerly an Italian  restaurant so some of the decor was left behind), but the food area is quite lovely and modern.  They also have a nice bar area with large flat screen televisions, but I've never gone over there nor have I had one of their cocktails.  They have a chalkboard when you walk in that tells you the drink specials of the day."}
{"text":"After eating here I am concerned with their cleanliness. The server came over to us with a dirty glass in her hand. She then took ours to get us more. I thought we would get new glasses, but when she came back the straw in both our cups were wet. I don't mind reusing my glass, but as she was carrying other people's glasses I am not confident she did not mix them up. If they are this cavalier with cups, I wonder what the kitchen is like. To be fair the place does look clean and the food is good. One star because I may have received a freshly used glass. If not for this, and the issue it poses I would have rated easily four stars."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today for lunch with my father.  Recently I have driven by the old town buffet a number of times and the cheap prices combined with the number of items they advertise as having on their buffet (200) catches my attention every time.  So today whenever my father and I were trying to thinking of a cheap and fast sit down place, this came to mind.  Whenever you first walk in you can see the restaurant is divided into two distinct areas, a dining room and the buffet.  The dining room has a number of larger and smaller tables as well as some booths.  Whenever we got there at around 11:30 the place was maybe a quarter full.  By the time we left it was closer to 80% or so full with hordes more people coming in as we were leaving.  My father and I were sat at a booth and shortly thereafter we headed up to the buffet.  I have to admit that I was impressed at the sheer size of it because it is pretty huge.  They have everything from Chinese food to sushi to American food and even a hibachi grill.  I know that I personally tried about 6 different chicken entrees myself and I barely put a dent in trying them all.  My favorite items on the buffet happened to be the hot and sour soup and then the crab rangoons.  The hot and sour soup was a bit spicier than most places which I loved and then the crab rangoons had a bit more liquid center than I am used to but better flavor.  My least favorite item on the buffet ended up being the General Tso's chicken.  Now I realize that each place has their own recipe but this didn't taste similar to any other that I have had before and seemed to lack a little of the heat while being overly sweet.  There were plenty of other dishes to make it for it though.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  While the food itself would only be worth 2 or 3 stars, the value of this place puts it over the top.  For $6.99 each, both my father and myself stuffed ourselves on the buffet."}
{"text":"Having a toddler, our family loves buffets because we can eat as soon as we are seated and can eat many small plates. We came here for lunch and was seated promptly at 11:30am. At this hour, ALL the dishes were fresh, hot, and \"Yum Yum\" (what our son sings when he likes something). Our son ate for free and our bill was a lot cheaper than the average ready made lunches. We will definitely be back for the lunches @ 11:30am!! Great value for the amount of foods to sample and enjoy.   If the music was better it may have been 5 stars. Our dining experience made us travel back in time by a few decades...that could be good or bad!"}
{"text":"I'm not to keen on Asian buffets, but since there was American food I figured I'd give it a shot. There is definitely a good variety of food. I personally go for the more \"American-ized\" type of Asian food and there was enough of that and typical buffet foods like meat, chicken to fill me as well.   The place is very nice (still resembling the old Tambellini's) and the staff is pleasant.   My only complaint is the they have a wide selection of food, but it was just... okay. Maybe it's because we got there around an hour before they closed, but none of the food tasted very fresh and up to temp. The bread was pretty hard and I don't think anything I tried was really too warm. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it was near closing, but it still makes me consider if I want to go back."}
{"text":"I had the dinner Buffett, which was $11.78 with tax. With that being said, it's worth the value. There is a ton of food options. I hit the Chinese buffet counter & the sushi counter. There are still a few other stations I couldn't try because I was full.  The quality of food was mediocre. If you are used to eating really good sushi or at good Chinese restaurants you need to lower your expectations. The size of the pieces of sushi are smaller than normal, & almost every piece had avocado, which became tiresome. Most of the Chinese food is fried.  Although I appreciate Asian people working in the front of the house, as it felt more authentic, the service sucks. My server brought me water initially but never stopped by to see how the food was. I had to get his attention to get a refill on water. Out of the hostess/cashier, the servers & the front house cooks I never saw one of them smiling. They were not friendly & welcoming.  Although spacious, which is nice, the lighting was very bright. In addition, the one thing that really pissed me off was the constant play of Christian Rock. Bad, bad call. They should be playing classical or traditional Asian music. Christian Rock is not appreciated by everyone & can alienate people.   I will not be going back to this place again, unless I hear of an internal overhaul. I get that it's a Buffett but they're not trying hard to attract more people & grow the business & it shows."}
{"text":"The quality of food was bad. Seems like the food has been sitting there since yesterday. The seafood I wouldn't eat either service not good either. Place is nice inside. I wouldn't go back ever."}
{"text":"Eww. Don't do it.  The quality of the food is poor. Each selection that we made from the buffet was either cold or overcooked and dry from sitting out for a long time.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is very poor and the facilities are poor and in disrepair. The tables are sticky and the booths have huge holes in them. The floor is filthy and there is a foul odor in the entire restaurant.  I was with my 10 year old daughter and was charged for 2 adult meals. When I mentioned this to the waitress, she said she'd fix it. Who I assume was the owner came over to the table and quite loudly said that my daughter was too tall and wanted her to stand up beside the table so that he could measure her and if she was over 5 ft tall he would charge her full price. She was mortified. I informed him that this was extremely rude and that he was not going to be measuring anybody. After arguing with me for a few minutes and causing a scene in the middle of the dining area, he reluctantly agreed to charge the appropriate price for a child. However, his rude behavior combined with the poor quality of food, and filthy conditions left me with a literal bad taste in my mouth.  I will never return to this dump and I expect it will be shut down soon."}
{"text":"It is sad to see what was once Louis Tambellini's magnificent, enormous restaurant now as a Chinese buffet, but time marches on.  The restaurant remains attractive and comfortable, room after room of tables.    I do not see any evidence that there is a manager or owner that a customer could ever get to know as the place is rather impersonal.  One server of mine was sullen; one was pleasant.  There is a tremendous selection of items, including sushi, hibachi, appetizers, salads, soups, entrees, good fried mushrooms and zucchini, fresh strawberries and pineapple.  The fresh fruit was a nice treat, but not as sweet or tasty as that which is served at similar restaurants.  I was afraid to try the \"Italian meat ball\" at a Chinese restaurant!  There is a sign addressing our \"value customer\": I suppose you could call us that!  It was disappointing that the only tofu was a container of small pieces of it to be added to soup.  The mixed vegetable dish contained no tofu.  The price of $8.99 for Saturday is quite reasonable, but not by comparison with Grand China in Bridgeville and Washington, Pennsylvania, which is $6.99, sometimes less with discount coupons that are received by mail.  Grand China offers the same types of dishes and stations that Yu's does and I like its food better.  There is something for everyone here, but I would not go out of the way to return."}
{"text":"I am in love with the all you can eat sushi bar here. I can't complain about this place, I'm here quite often. Probably more than I should be, but the Sushi call me in."}
{"text":"Are here a few weeks ago with my son and needless to say I was very very disappointed. The food has no taste whatsoever the sushi is like something you get a gas stop down in Arkansas. Worst part about the whole meal was it was supposed to be a nice lunch for two but a baby cockroach in my son's water  made it a party for three. The waitstaff didn't feel the least bit bad over this dilemma. I pleaded to have a discount on my meal as the cockroach was scurrying across the table running from the subpar food. I spoke with the manager and he offered a 20% discount on my sons food, that really wouldn't even cover the amount of food and water the cockroach consummed. I would not eat here if it was the last place on earth it's dirty it's nasty, and nothing has a taste, and they have bugs. I'd sooner eat chipped ham from the bathroom floor of Heinz Field with my hands tied behind my back."}
{"text":"Great sushi and a lot to choose from... The staff is quick to help you or serve your needs"}
{"text":"Besides playing Jesus music the entire time, this Chinese buffet isn't bad. They have a large spread, sushi included. I wish they had tofu though.."}
{"text":"I thought this was a Pretty good buffet here.  My first impression was the large choice of sushi.  Not the best, but a lot to pick from.  They also had a decant selection of items in the stir fry section, always my favorite.  5 or 6 soups, a good salad bar, lots of Chinese and American entrees, and plenty of deserts.  Everything I tried I liked, and that's different from the typically half full plates that don't get eaten because I hate them at most buffets.  I'd come back if I'm in the area again, although I don't see myself going out of the way for it."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this is a \"Chinese style buffet\" inside an old Italian restaurant, but looks Spanish?! Pretty popular from my perspective, popped in on a Sunday afternoon, the lot looked full but the restaurant is so huge, it seemed empty. It's smaller (less offerings) than most all you can eat Chinese buffets.   We were seated pretty far from the buffet, which can be a good thing, or not. Fellow YELPER Kevin C. joined me for dinner, heading to the buffet is where we parted ways. I headed straight to the sushi station and filled a platter with tempting offerings and a bowl of seaweed salad. Kevin found all his favorites, including Crab Rangoon and dumplings.   For sushi lovers there isn't a lot of choices, but for 16 bucks you can get your sushi fix and fill up nicely. I had a huge bowl of healthy seaweed salad that I've paid 8.95 for at Yokoso! They did have salmon, red snapper, yellow fin, and sea bass, vegan rolls and crab rolls. As I said, not a lot of choices but the Sushi chef if right there making them as fast as they go. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the freshness.   I did look around and found they had all the normal offerings found on Chinese buffets, General Tso's, sweet n sour, fried rice, noodles, green beans etc.   The building used to be Tambellini's, a old name associated with the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. It looks like it could use some spiffing up as I noticed broken light fixtures, burned out bulbs in chandeliers, and outside, cracked siding and pieces of the roof laying in the parking lot.   I'd say bypass this place and hit up some of the better buffets the city has to offer. Hokkaido on Brown's Hill Road comes to mind!"}
{"text":"Lunch is 12 bucks all you can eat plus free hibachi can't beat it food is decent definitely better than the one at century square"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Chinese buffets I've been to in Pittsburgh. Aside from the fact that they do not keep some of their items heated well enough, the food quality overall was not bad for a Chinese buffet.   I was happy with the wide variety of food and sushi available for lunch. There were 2 vegetarian rolls (avocado & cucumber and tofu skin) which were pretty good. For vegetarians, there were several mixed vegetable dishes which is surprisingly rare to find in other buffets. Sadly, like every other buffet, there was no tofu entree option :( The dessert selection was decent but not as good as Hokkaido's.   Overall, I was pleased with my experience. It's a great deal for an $8.99 lunch buffet. The selection was good, quality of food was decent, and the wait staff were friendly and quick to remove our dirty plates. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Prior to switching names (and I'm assuming owners) this place was AMAZING. The sushi was fabulous and all of their food was fresh and of high quality. They also had crab legs and a large variety of desserts, including a soft serve ice cream machine. Following the name change, I have noticed a significant change in the quality of the sushi as well as the food. It is not terrible, but not nearly as good as it used to be. I really wish it would go back to the way that it once was."}
