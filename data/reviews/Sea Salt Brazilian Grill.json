{"text":"We were referred to this by a Brazilian missionary friend. They said it was as good as the Brazilian BBQ restaurants where they bring the skewers to the table, but without being so pricey. 

$9.99 for AYCE lunch including the meats. Great deal...great selection...(I think there were 11 different meats on skewer) not to mention the several hot dishes that were nothing to sneeze at.  Strip mall storefront with a homey, family vibe. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good staff is friendly! the buffet is diff all the time, it can be a good and a bad thing cause sometimes they have good choices and sometimes they dont. Other than that i think its great place!"}
{"text":"First time there. Excellent service, very friendly staff. The meats are flavorful with many options/cuts. Good options from the salad bar. Can't beat the lunch price ($10) for all you can eat meats/salad bar. Best grilled meat in Monroe. Don't take my word for it...go try it!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch. The food is fresh and has lots of flavor. The prices are very affordable and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great service!  Restaurant is a tad small with various options on the buffet, but all tasty.  I loved their house special steak - they slice thin pieces off for you, so make sure to get a good amount!

The only downside was that though tasty, many of their dishes were very salty and bacon was used a bit too much in most of the dishes on the buffet.

Overall, I'd still recommend a visit here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The buffet was delicious .... literally every food offered was delicious and well prepared. It may appear small - but I assure you, it is a wide variety and incredibly filling! 

The ambience is casual. Decor is simple, CLEAN and pleasant! 

The service is top notch. Very respectful, prompt and accommodating. 

A hidden gem in Monroe!!! 

Oh, did I mention the price is phenomenal!!!! 
A QUALITY buffet at the same cost as the local chain buffet..... need I say more!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing food. I've been to the main steakhouses in the Charlotte area, but this one is by far the best. The prices and food quality are the best! I've been a couple of times with my boyfriend and we always leave this place happy and fulfilled. They also do take out. All staff are Brazilians, food is prepared by Brazilians, it is the most authentic brazilian steakhouse in the area."}
{"text":"Nice lunch stop although we found the price point a little high for our capacity to eat. But if you've got people who like to eat a lot, then you're probably getting better value than we did!
Meats were well prepared, and salads and sides were good. If we're in the area we would not hesitate to stop again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the staff is very friendly. The food is also good and the price is totally affordable. I definitely will come back ."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that I meant give tge review on. It is an authentic Brazilian restaurant with an outstanding buffet. Almost did not get my husband out of here. Yum"}
{"text":"Tried this establishment based on YELP reviews, and folks, give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. The food and service are excellent. The buffet includes all the basic salad entries and some classic Brazilian dishes, but where they make their mark is the meat selection, here you can sample chicken, pork, and steak. For the price you can't wrong, so folks, give the franchise places a rest and support the local guy."}
{"text":"Great place!! 

The food taste like home made, the service is cordial and fast and the meats are great!

It's affordable and casual. You're getting the same quality meat from the fancy stake houses for 1/3 of the price!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food all natural and fresh...the owner very friendly. Most definitely my husband and I will return to Charlotte and eat here again. 100% Brazilian food"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I mostly had chicken hearts (I see you making that \"ewwww\" face: don't knock it until you've tried it!), but the house special was the best of all meats. The only reason why 4 out of 5 is because the meat had been on the rotisserie for s while and was a little dry on the outside.  Tomato salad and yellow rice were very tasty.  Lemonade was fresh and delicious, too.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We just found this hidden gem in Monroe today. I am so glad we did. Authentic Brazilian food and great service!  Choice of many buffet items as well as 10 different prepared meats. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Not a lot of variety but excellent amount for the price."}
{"text":"Best and affordable steak house in Monroe, NC. Me and my crew from A1A Roadside Assistance of Charlotte, decided to give them a try, food pretty good"}
{"text":"Well, I was at this restaurant yesterday and I can tell it was great to see that they finally opened a place like this in Charlotte.

The food was awesome, the prices was as well. I can recommend the salad bar (especially the chicken salad). The white rice is so far the best I've tried out of home. The pork ribs were so good that I regretted not having more.

Now, I have to stop at the meat station. The lamb leg was perfectly cooked, not to even mention the Picanha. The top sirloin was also fantastic.

I'm not giving 5 stars because of the location. It took me an hour to get there so if they open a location closer I will give 5 stars definitely and will become a regular patron."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the staff members here are very friendly (minus the guy serving the meat) and are actually Brazilian, a rarety it seems anymore. Additionally, the majority of the patrons during my visit were Brazilian, another positive sign.

The dinner price excluding tax is ~$10 for the hot and cold buffets (AYCE) and ~$15 if you want to include meats (also AYCE). This is NOT a rodizio style restaurant hence the lower price point.

The cold bar is akin to most any Brazilian restaurant in the US (just smaller), however, the hot bar features more authentic dishes such as stewed okra w/ chicken, galinhada mineira, etc. If you are looking for \"Brazilian steakhouse\" staples like p√£o de queijo or fried bananas, they don't have them here as far as I can tell.

There are approximately 10 cuts of meat including chicken hearts (authentic Brazilian but I am not a fan). They are hand carved at the buffet station as opposed to the rodizio method of coming tableside, but are kept fresh on the grill.

The meats are grilled to temp and are well seasoned and delicious. 

This restaurant has some staff/managerial ties to Chima, and I can say that the meats here were better than 75% of the times that I have visited Chima Uptown (which costs four times as much).

I am very happy to see a restaurant such as this in the Greater Charlotte area (especially since Monesi in Greensboro closed) and can not only highly recommend this restaurant, but will also be sure to make a return visit!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Came here on a bunch of a few reviews and was not disappointed. Monroe from my experience here has not really been known for its culinary specialties as there are not many good local kitchens here. There are two though that have really now stood out. My favorite Stone Table and I will easily place Sea Salt as my number two. 

When we arrived, there was no one here. The chef prepared the specialties right there and made them fresh for us. The house specials are great. Fresh, delicious, flavorful. I would definitely come back here and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I really, really really wanted to like this place but I can't. The salad bar was less than mediocre, side dishes were unimpressive, but the real disappointment was the meat. It was beyond well done, with not a drop of juice left. Every single cut we tried. Maybe things were different if we came on a busier day? We came Saturday night... The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 1 is because I really wanted to like it :("}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. Awesome options anytime you come in. As a Brazilian I endorse Sea Salt as an authentic option for a Brazilian steak house.
Service was good at lunch and I will come back for diner soon. Thank you Adriano and Patricia!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of these types of restaurants I had to give it a try. We are frequent customers at Rioz and Chima. The staff are super friendly and attentive and explained everything in detail. I'll have to disagree with the reviewer that said the person serving the meats was unfriendly, he was super nice and accommodating, asking exactly how we liked our meats prepared. He even came to our table and talked for a while explaining that they are starting lunch specials which includes there meats and fries or other sides, for a very good price. 

 We chose the cold, hot and meat bars and we where not disappointed. The meats perfectly cooked and seasoned, the beans and rice delicious,potatoes perfectly cooked and the vinaigrette tangy and delicious. I tried one piece of each, House sirloin (my absolute favorite here, Chima and Rioz), chicken wing (juicy and crispy), garlic sirloin (perfectly seasoned), Rib and the sausage (snaps when you bite into it). The guy cooking the meats is also the manager at Chima so he knows his stuff.

The only thing missing is the popovers and fried polenta with Parmesan (Rioz), but that's why the prices are low. We will be back on a weekend and bring our family to enjoy the delicious food and great service. I will spread the word for them, Monroe needed a place like this."}
