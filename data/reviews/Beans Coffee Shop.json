{"text":"If you like weak flavorless coffee, this is the place for you! I have been here 3 times. Once for a Cafe Americano, the others for a cup of bold roast.  The coffee was awful; warm, weak coffee served from a vacuum pump thermos dispenser. UGHH. I gave it an extra star because it is a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Love this place, good service, great product and a friendly environment makes this place the place to be for coffee. the fabulous location makes getting here and easy trip and a worthwhile trip!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a coffee or pastry in Chardon. Clean, well-lit, great wi-fi, and a pleasant atmosphere. If you're on the Square, this is a must-see."}
{"text":"The oatmeal is very very good. My boss got a breakfast sandwich on the pretzel bun and it was quite large for the price. Ill ne coming back again."}
{"text":"I read Yelp reviews and they were excellent. This is why we went there. Our review is the coffee was not as hot as it should be for a coffee house. I had pancakes. They were very dry and the small amount of syrup they give you is really a joke. I did get extra and still not enough to counter the dryness of the pancakes. We were very disappointed in our experience. Would love to have a place to go for breakfast regularly."}
{"text":"Great space and menu full of variety. Two drinks - one drip and one latte for $6.46. Then the service told me she couldn't take my card because they have a card minimum. Really!?! They should just give a discount to people who pay with cash; pretty sure they did away with minimums...they can ask but cannot mandate. And wasn't that only for Visa?"}
{"text":"Nice place to sit while working on a computer or reading a book on the couch in front. I wish there were more salad options."}
{"text":"Came here to meet with a client early afternoon. They said they were closing, which seemed strange for the time of day. Apparently they don't like the high schoolers coming in after class, so they close the store. Too funny - they're worried about the wealthy kids in this community buying $6 coffees. You can bypass this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its kind of hit-or-miss. The food is good but the coffee drinks are sometimes ok, other times lousy. It's not that hard to make a caramel latte!"}
{"text":"Such a cute coffee shop in chardon square. They actually have a decent lunch menu too. I would go here again !"}
{"text":"Very quaint coffee shop. My highlights: -pretty good size; lots of tables and even a few on the patio  -the food is good! I've tried two of the sandwiches and, although they may be slightly overpriced, were delicious  -many coffee syrup flavors and monthly specials that inspire some pretty unique drinks"}
{"text":"This little coffee shop is adorbs. Yes, I just used that word and yes, I am totes okay with it! Who woulda thunk that an uppity small town like Chardon could house such a quaint and homey coffee shop? Not me! But, it made the flea market trip that much better!  Nestled right in the heart of Chardon square in between antique shops is this cute little coffee shop. The name is simple, but it really fits the feel you get when you walk in. Love the logo on the front window and the patio outside is quaint.....giving you a nice view of this historic square and fantastic architecture of the buildings around it. Walking inside you are smacked with the smell of fresh roasted beans. That is right folks, these people roast their own beans. Sweet mother of monkey milk, the smell inside is fantastic. I could stay for hours soaking up that sweet coffee roasted goodness.  Plenty of seating throughout...which is nice to see in a small town establishment. Plenty of tables for groups and a nice intimate leather couch/chair arrangement near the front windows. Tons of natural light make this place bright and cheerful. Basic decor but truly effective. Love the architectural nuances of the original structure. Gives it lots of charm. Clean bathrooms make my heart smile. A whole star for this place being really clean.   Ordered some food and really enjoyed it:  1) Cheese omelet: Light and fluffy and cooked to perfection folks. The chicken would be proud. Just the right amount of cheese too!  2) Muffin top: Ok, this thing is more like a cake. IT IS HUGE! I did not eat this, but I will tell you that those who split this (yes, it is THAT BIG) said it was absolutely awesome. It was describe as fluffy, flavorful and super moist. Sounds good to me!  The menu here is small but effective. Healthy options and things that can be made healthy. I was genuinely bummed they offered nothing to the gluten free crowd. A trendy and hipster place like this really should. They lose a star for this. They have a large dessert case and could easily slip in a few items. Plus, GF bread is easy to get your hands on and can be frozen! I would like to see more salad and veggie options, but really.....I do not go to coffee shops for salads. That is why I said I want GF desserts! Coffee and dessert are like peanut butter and chocolate.   Overall, a great little place! When in the area, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best breakfast sandwiches that I have ever had here. Great atmosphere and friendly staff too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop in Chardon square. They do breakfast and lunch, and they have bakery iteams. Great coffee. Beans are for sale too."}
{"text":"We happened to be in Chardon and were happy to find a coffee place on the square. The interior is homey and seems like the kind of place you could hang out for a while. We both had iced coffees which hit the spot on a warm summer day. I'm sure we'll stop back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! Always great food and great service! Their breakfast sandwiches are very good and I am a big fan of their hot chocolate with a shot of espresso!"}
{"text":"While this place is nice, the service is good...frankly the coffee sucks. It's just not good quality."}
{"text":"Located in a cozy historic building on Chardon Square is a family owned coffee shop with welcoming friendly service. The style is a mix of blonde wood country and rustic contemporary with chalkboard hand written menus. The interior could use a little attention but there are things that do look modernized, so maybe it's a work in progress.  We ordered a wrap that came with pickle and chips, a cup of tomato soup, a baked good, a cup of coffee and hot tea and our bill was $19. The soup and sandwich were both excellent and made with fresh healthy ingredients. They were both flavorful. I'd highly recommend the Johnny Utah wrap. The tea, coffee and brownie were basic... nothing special. Some of the other baked goods looked better and homemade. My chocoholic husband chose the brownie which looked like GFS's. I drink my coffee black and it was weak for me. I tried the serenity which was the medium roast. They had three varieties pre-made and in plastic pump-style carafes on a separate self serve counter. Then there was a little sign on the wall that said \"refills $1.50.\" They do have soy and almond milk alternatives. Maybe next time I'll try a chai latte.  I don't believe they're open Sunday's or evenings. It's a good place to stop to do some work with free wifi or meet a friend. There are also some board games available to use. There's a nice leather furniture conversation area up by the front windows.  Making some cosmetic updates would boost the rating here since coffee shops should be serene and the nicked walls, carpet and blah tables distract from that. I'd like to try a different coffee variety also to see if it's more impressive. Another thing that hurts is that if you're going to charge for in house refills on plain coffee, don't have a self serve station of pump style carafe dispensers. Just give me a fresh cup at the counter! All in all, I'd come back. It's a nice option on the square."}
{"text":"Beans is in a great location located in Chardon square.   We wanted something tasty and small for lunch while we were hitting some local garage sales.   First, the smoothy was delicious. I ordered a blueberry/strawberry.  My husband ordered a chocolate milk shake. He enjoyed it, however it was a bit watery.   We ordered 2 of the bean club sandwiches.   The pretzel bun was good, it was loaded with turkey, ham and bacon. Also was supposed to have cheese and a spicey mustard.   There was a bit too much meat on it. The cheese and sauce were absent.  Leaving the sandwich flavorless and boring.   The store front was clean and the staff was very nice. But, the food wasn't that great. I'll probably check them out again."}
{"text":"Solid little coffee shop in the Chardon square.  I love supporting places like this.  It was clean, bright, and bustling with people reading, studying, and enjoying coffee.  I got myself a cup of joe to go, but this is definitely a place I'd feel comfortable hanging out at.  Support your local coffee house!"}
{"text":"Want good coffee and decent sandwiches when traveling across Northern Ohio? Look no further. Bean is worth a short detour and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Beans is just the cutest little place. I have spent many hours in Beans and I absolutely love the vibe and how nice all of the people are. They are great. I personally don't drink coffee, so I can't speak on that... but I did get steamers and other drinks that were all very good.  I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned coffee shop right in the heart of Chardon on the square!! When you walk in you get a very friendly and cozy vibe! It's nice because they can cater to those with allergies! They have soy and almond milk for dairy alternatives!"}
{"text":"One of the only places in NE Ohio which roasts its own beans!  For the normal coffee connoisseur, their Columbian Peaberry is excellent is their Solstice blend.  Best part?  They warm their cups.  It's the simple things, you know?  If the \"coffee drink\" is more your style, they have a great selection of syrups and their special drinks are creative and tasty without being too sweet [like they do at Charbucks] Breakfast food is varied with mostly bagels, muffins, and egg dishes.  Lunches provide good sandwiches and out of this world homemade soups. Desserts provides baked goods and ice cream with the special treat of serving Graeters Ice Cream out of Cincinnati. Service is pleasant and prompt [depending on crowd]. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Quaint coffee shop is perfect for the historic square  of the county seat of Geauga County. Meet new owner Sylvia who's a delight, just like her shop. She loves her shop and only plans to freshen it up. I love it as is!  May's coffee of the month was French Toast. I had it cold, and the cinnamon flavor was refreshing for this sunny morning. Wall menu includes pastries, breakfast, and lunch sandwiches. Lots of tables. Friendly folks. Lots of street parking. This is a destination!"}
