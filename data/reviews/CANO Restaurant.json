{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats....I'll say that the Burrata salad and Arancini were good. However, as an Italian restaurant their Tagliatelle bolognese was shockingly bad. It was so overcooked and tasteless I ended up tossing it out. I am a huge pasta fan and am always looking for good pasta in Toronto - so let me tell you to save your money and skip this place. The cano fritto was okay but did not come with the house made aoili sauce and had 2 shrimp only - for $17 I'd tell you to skip this. So this place gets a 1 star because the pasta was one of the worst pastas I have ever had......"}
{"text":"Popped in while in the neighborhood for an early dinner with 2 kids. I had an amazing mushroom pasta dish. Pizza was good too and we ordered a gluten free penne pomodoro and it was great for the kids. The kale salad was great even without the bacon as we don't eat pork.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the St Clair strip. The menu is rather on the small side but everything we tried was delicious. We had the Cano Fritto, carbonara, fettuccini bolognese and Pizza with prosciutto. Everything was tasty but the pizza was the highlight. Pastas were cooked al dente. Service was very attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to the area! Everything we had was delicious - the arancini, meatballs, gnudi, tagliatelle - fresh, homemade, flavourful. One of the owners was a bit snippy and the other very gracious; service was fast enough and the food was really good my only complaints were that the prices for a family meal are a bit high; it's more of a date night price point so that is a deterrent for us in a neighbourhood place. The second criticism I have is the lack of reasonably priced wine; the cheapest bottle was $50 and again, coming there with the family it'd be nice to have a cheaper option when we're just looking for a good quality bite in the hood. We will be back without kids so we can enjoy it more thoroughly!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what this restaurant brings to the area that isn't already available and slightly better,  the food is decent but there is nothing on the menu which makes CANO anymore appealing than the other nearby more established restaurants. The decor is very nice, the staff is attentive and its a nice place for a couple (certainly not aimed at families)."}
{"text":"My mom and I had a truly excellent meal I had here - high quality, delicious food (can't stop thinking about the pasta dishes we had) and delicious panna cotta for dessert. Service was okay only - there were only 2 tables in the restaurant but it was at times hard to flag the server down. He seemed to spend a lot of time talking with other guys in the kitchen area."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there this evening, and it was fabulous! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the bartender with a smile. We were seated immediately and the evening only got better from there. We ordered the tuna ceviche as an appetizer and it was delicious. It was served with thinly sliced toasted crostini bread and sliced lemon, simple perfection. We also had the funghi Fritti, simply put, I have no words to describe how wonderful it was! Our entrees were the Baked wild halibut and Gnudi al Pomodoro Hand made ricotta gnudi, roasted tomato sugo, buratta, extraordinary. Light, creamy and pure indulgence. We finished our meal with the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotto Topped with salted caramel, pure decadence on a plate! I highly recommend this restaurant, from the reclaimed barn board walls to the young passionate staff, this restaurant has all the down-to-earth qualities that you wouldn't typically expect in a 5 star restaurant. Daniel and Adam, bravo, and continued success on your wonderful restaurant! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I subscribed to their Instagram after I saw their picture of carbonara with poached egg. I was like I must try this.  I was there with family on a weekday afternoon. Reservation was easy. You can do everything online. I was there at around 6:30pm. The place was pretty empty but nice decoration and gives a cozy feeling.  We ordered the kale salad and grilled octopus for appetizers. The kale salad was amazing and the grilled octopus tasted good. But the portion was a lot smaller from their pictures, we order got 4 pieces of octopus which was disappointing comparing to their pictures. I ordered the carbonara with poached egg for main obviously and my parents ordered the seafood linguine and the fresh catch of the day special. Then things went downhill from there. When the food arrive, I didn't see the poached egg on my Cabonara! So I asked the waitress where is my poached egg and she said they broke the egg and its inside the carbonara. I was extremely disappointed. The portion of seafood they give you was quite good but some of the mussels weren't too fresh. You can taste some of them were off. Overall the food was quite tasty but it was a little on the salty side. I would say the food was quite tasty but I doubt I would go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic new restaurant on St. Clair West!  A great restaurant addition to the neighbourhood that was in need of a fresh dining experience.   Cocktails:  Hand crafted cocktails were absolutely fantastic. I had the cano aperol spritz and my friend had the guava sour. Both so delicious. We normally go for wine, but the cocktails were too tempting to pass up.  Sharing:   The arancini were amazing! Probably the best I've had. That feeling when you need to stop the conversation just to enjoy the flavours...that was the arancini at Cano.  We also got the pesce crudo, and the fish last night was tuna. Super delicious and refreshing.  Mains:  Will definitely be going back because everything looked awesome. Wish we tried the pizza but didn't want to overload on the carbs. I couldn't choose between the two gnudi dishes so we got both and shared.  gnudi al pomodoro - the tomato sauce was awesome, and I'm usually critical of tomato sauce at restaurants being Italian myself but their roasted tomato sugo with the great portion of burrata cheese made this dish a total indulgent treat.   HOWEVER the gnudi con funghi was second to none. Up until last night, my favourite pasta dish in the city was the malfade ai funghi at Gusto 101. But this dish was better. And that's saying a lot! The flavours were unreal. Again, super indulgent but it's a treat that's 100% worth it. Incredible. So good. I'm craving right now lol.  Dessert:  Both my friend and I got the passionfruit panna cotta. A beautiful dish with excellent flavours. A great, refreshing dessert that somehow we made room for. But it was absolutely delicious. I'm usually a chocolate lover, but this was wonderful.    A great dining experience, with fantastic food. I look forward to returning and so glad that we have a great new restaurant on St. Clair W that completely trumps the local Marcello's and Pizza e Pazzi. The area needed something modern and fresh!  Also want to shout out the excellent server Marina who was very knowledgeable, passionate and friendly. She was so sweet and made the experience even sweeter.   Check out Cano!!"}
{"text":"The Ibisco contained Havana Club, mint, red jalapeno, fresh grapefruit juice, and house made hibiscus juice.  It turned out to be a red-coloured drink.  When I saw the bartender slice up the red jalapenos and put them fresh in the drink (and I smelled the spice), I was a little fearful that the drink would be too spicy for my taste.  Fortunately, it didn't turn out to be the case and it was a very nice cocktail.  I also tried a sip of the Cano Mojito.  It was very refreshing and light.  The Arancini were the first to arrive.  There was risotto, fontina, beef veal pork ragu, and green peas inside the crunchy deep fried rice ball.  I admired how the arancini were perfect spheres!  The inside of the arancini was very tasty.  The Burratina pizza had burrata, tomato sugo, and basil on it.  I thought that while the burrata was delicious and the pizza crust was extremely thin, it was so thin and crunchy that its texture tasted resembled a cracker's thinness.  The Gnudi con Fungh were hand made ricotta gnudi with wild mushrooms and truffle cream.  Mmm, this was absolutely delicious!  I loved the truffle cream mixed in with the mushroom sauce and the wild mushrooms themselves.  The hand made ricotta gnudi were very, very soft and different from the texture of gnocchi (although this wasn't gnocchi).  The tomato version of the gnudi dish was the Gnudi di Pomodoro.  This had hand made ricotta gnudi as well with roasted tomato sugo, and burrata.  I really enjoyed this one because of the burrata.  The burrata were in big chunks and made for a really tasty combination with the refreshing tomato sugo.  It took a while but our two dishes of Cano Fritto did arrive.  This was a dish of fried calamari, cod, and shrimp served with a house aioli.  I really liked the fried seafood here, especially the shrimp that was very firm in texture!  I liked how the batter wasn't thick at all either.  The Polipo was the grilled octopus platter with redskin potatoes and salmoriglio.  This also took a while to arrive and we also didn't receive the two orders that we had placed.  We only received one order.  The grilled octopus was very good; not chewy and nicely seasoned.  The Linguine di Pesce was a really delicious pasta dish!  It had sea scallops, mussels, tiger shrimps, and calamari in a roasted tomato sugo.  The spaghetti was al dente and the sauce was light yet delicious.  The seafood in this pasta dish were fresh.  I tried the tiger shrimp and mussels and both were great!"}
{"text":"It's a great atmosphere. We went for dinner on a Saturday at 4:30pm lol and there were able to accommodate us. First we shared the octopus which was so flavourful, juicy, crunchy and not tough which is always good. We had an amazing Pinot Nero white wine. And then came the show stopper gnudi con fungi! We will return to this restaurant just for this pasta. Delicious and heavenly! Service was great too. Thanks"}
{"text":"Booked a weekday reservation at Cano for a special day. The service was spectacular ! The cano Instagram site intrigued both of us. Cano even wrote us back before the meal to wish us a great meal. The staff was so so helpful. I had to try the great selection of cocktails . The ibisco was spicy but not too much.. loved it. The appetizers were beautiful and delicious . We had the grilled octopus and  burrata tomato salad . Then for the main meal we shared the lamb chops and gnudi con fungi!! Wow both mains were perfect. The lamb chop , taro mash, rapini and roasted yellow beets tasted superb. They have several types of gnudi. We loved the mushroom choice. We were too full for dessert but the whole staff brought us over a macha cheesecake. Who could say no!!  A must visit for a memorable experience and meal . Thank you Cano"}
{"text":"The food was so yummy and the service was excellent. Still dreaming about the chicken and potatoes so good! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the staff in the restaurant needs to be increased.  There was one wait staff looking over the whole restaurant. I went with my family we had the fish that was good. The rigatoni and chicken skewers. Definitely no complaints on the food but it was not amazing, just good!   I probably would not go back but I'm not unhappy with the meal."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was a little slow but the restaurant was busy. A great family place for sharing"}
{"text":"Awful service, amazing pasta. If you can put up with watching the owner hang out with his staff by the bar while you wait in agony for the machine, then the pasta is worth it. Chicken was average, bruschetta was amazing. Mixed because service was so bad (not once but twice)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here just a few hours ago. Sunday night prime dinner time first weekend of summer. We did not have a reso. But we got the only table of two thank god weed did. Cause that little place filled up real fast I told my bf to prepare him self for small dishes but really good dishes I figured they would be small cause it's all fresh. Well let's just say we walked outta there stuffed off one app. And two entree's the food was amazing. It was fresh home made u can taste the ingredients. For those saying potions on the smaller side. That's only if you're use to eating junk. The food was bomb. I will try everything on this menu finally a place close to my house with my type of quality   Cheers Jami"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been opened for 3 weeks. The food was excellent. The service outstanding. We shared Kale salad with maple dijon dressing, Grilled octopus and calabriapizza which had mozzarella | soppressata | tomato | green olives | red onions | pepperoncino.  The pizza was spicy and fantastic with a wonderful thin crust. The beers were also great. There is only seating for about 30 people and no reservations. I highly reccommend this restaurant. We will be oing back many times and introducing our friends to it."}
