{"text":"I had the Bistro Burger with a side order of french fries. The burger was brought out to my table and I found it be simple, but delicious. The fries were hot and had a nice salt & pepper seasoning.  Although I did not try the salad, it looked great -- a ton of options, friendly staff to help you with your selections. Once you pick everything, they chop it and give you dressing. The salad was what I thought to be a big portion, much bigger than Panera and customized to what you want.  This is a great concept. I'm sure the place will do well. I'm told at lunch the line is already out the door and its not even the school year yet...  Its also nice how they have garage style doors at the front to keep a nice breeze coming through and leave the place feeling more open."}
{"text":"Ordered a cup of their usually good chicken noodle soup to go. Walked down Forbes Ave for a while and sat down to eat and it was unbearably salty. Inedible. Walked back to get it swapped for something else (they were out of their other soups, as it was late in the evening). I opted for a $4 breakfast sandwich. The manager was unwilling to compensate me in any other way than by deducting the price of the soup from what I was getting (which was $1.50 more than the soup). He insulted me by offering an order of fries instead (which was worth less than the soup). I wasted 10 minutes twice waiting for the food and another 10 minutes walking back. You can't treat a customer like that. I wasn't asking for the world. I was forced to pay full price for something I didn't originally want after having walked back and forth and waiting for it to be prepared."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is basically Eat-n-Park with a nice pair of shoes and a haircut. The burger was edible, on a nice bun, but otherwise unremarkable. Institutional patties on a high-end bun. French fries were nicely crisp and flavorful.  Service was poor--surly cashiers and a twenty-minute wait for any order with a milkshake--and burgers sat getting soggy until the shakes were ready. Perhaps due to the lunch rush, but still not a great experience.  The salad assembly line is the restaurant's centerpiece, I'll go back to try one--but there are much better burgers to be had for a similar price Downtown. Definitely not worth the wait and the crowd."}
{"text":"I love salads, but am always too lazy to get all the ingredients together!  Enter, Hello Bistro!  They have a great selection of ingredients to try, so that you can create the salad of your dreams!!!  Seriously, you can customize just about any aspect.  Amount of dressing, how much they chop it, whatever you want!  (Tip: Ask for the dressing on the side, even if you chose light)  Or they have several standard salads that you can also opt to order and save yourself the trouble of having to make any decisions.  The staff is always friendly and quick.  The space is clean and spacious.  There's really not much you can complain about!"}
{"text":"Wish they had this place back home in CA! Love discovering places to get a healthy meal while traveling for business. This place also offered some indulgences in the form of burgers, fries & grilled cheeses, so it's the best of both worlds. Affordable prices too.  I've been to plenty of build-your-own salad places, but this one takes the cake! They have tons of ingredient options: fresh fruits & veggies, different cheeses, beans, crunchies & plenty of creative dressings (I tried the Agave Chili Lime...slightly sweet with a little zip, yum!). My only complaint was that a few veggies looked less than fresh (broccoli w/ brown edges, slimy mushrooms), but I could've just caught them on a bad day. They will chop the ingredients into small, medium or large pieces based on your preference & then toss with your dressing.   Another time I went in, I had the Broccauliflower Grilled Cheese...it was epic. Golden brown, perfectly crispy & cheesy. The chunks of broccoli & cauliflower inside added nice texture & made me feel a little less guilty about hoovering the whole sandwich haha. You could tell the fries were homemade...they sort of reminded me of In-N-Out Burger's.   Will definitely be back next time I'm in the 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"Custom salads with all of the toppings you can think of, including chickpeas, quinoa, and lentils....not to mention over twenty dressing options. They cost about $10 but the salads are large and very filling, even if you don't pay extra for meat. Add a soft drink and take in all of the delicious soda flavors. This is a favorite spot of mine in case you can't tell. I go after the gym for a healthy meal or during lunch hours at work. They now allow you to order ahead of time online so there's no excuse not to go!"}
{"text":"The salads. Seriously. They are the best. I've had many different variations of making my own, and they are always amazing. The crew at the Downtown location is fabulous, too, and they can squash a line out the door in 5 minutes flat (and with smiles!). It's really pretty impressive. Seriously a big fan."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  Confirmed location and likability with hotel staff.  Came on a Wednesday night around 7:30PM while visiting from out-of-town.  What a great local concept.  Restaurant was clean, cool, and clearly laid out.  Only a few other patrons at that hour on that day.  I got their Soba Salmon Salad and wife made her own.  Kids got cheeseburgers w/ fries and (excellent, more natural) Boylan soda (all for $5 for each kid).  Burgers were good, simple, but good quality.  Fries were plentiful and excellent, fresh-cut, and well-seasoned (not overly seasoned).  Ketchup (Heinz, of course) and their house-made (semi-famous) ranch dressing for dipping.  Wife's salad had all the ingredients she could choose, and her eyes got big.  Picked her bed of greens, toppings galore (beets two ways made her day), asked for salmon (but we agreed she probably didn't need it since everything else provided abundant flavor/substance).  Some crispy and fruity toppings near the end of the bar.  Got to sample a dressing before committing to one.  They chopped it all up for her and handed her a bowl that was HEAVY.  Didn't really finish the whole thing because the portion ended up being enormous.  The only negative thing was that they were out of cookies, maybe because it was so late in the day.  We thought about asking for fruit as a substitute, but passed."}
{"text":"This new restaurant  seems very promising. The staff is very friendly, and greats every patron as they enter. They really live up to the name, Hello Bistro.\" Most importantly, the food is very good, especially for the price. While the immense fresh full service salad bar seemed enticing, I opted for the Bistro Burger.  The burger came quickly after I ordered it  the patty itself was thin, think Five Guys style, but was flavorful and tender.  The toppings were very fresh and crisp; I think they came from the salad bar  All in all, the burger was well built and tasty.  Sadly the fries, while fresh and hot, seemed rather dry and didn't match the quality of the burger.  Luckily, my thirst was quenched by Boylan specialty sodas, including cane cola and Birch Beer.  The facility itself has an open and clean feel, which is impressive due to it's location."}
{"text":"Was recommended to stop here by my sister and I was so glad we did.   Order a make your own salad fit for a king, they have every imaginable salad addition you could crave. Besides the salad, their salad dressings come in a great assortment and they'll let you try them all if you want. The lime vinaigrette and BBQ chipotle shouldn't be missed, they elevate the salad to another level.  Usually I'm not a soda drinker but with a Boylan's fountain, I couldn't help it. They also have beer...yes, beer!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I went in intending to order a salad but found myself going for something warm on a cold winter evening: the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. Nothing fancy about it, but delicious all the same! Great for when you're just looking for some quick comfort food."}
{"text":"Over priced and under filling. A $9 salad shouldn't be 95% lettuce. Save your money for somewhere else. Their saving grace is the beer."}
{"text":"This is really more of a 2 1/2 star rating, and I'm only rating the salads. I feel like I should give Hello Bistro more credit for being the only make-your-own salad place around, but that doesn't automatically mean that it's got quality, delicious food. Maybe I'm spoiled from four years of living in DC, where fresh, fast salad places like Sweetgreen and Chop't (not to mention other types of amazing, delicious fast-casual cuisine places like Shophouse, BGR, Good Stuff Eatery, etc) abound. I'm used to fresh, organic, local ingredients and house-made salad dressings for a reasonable price.  Hello Bistro's produce, unfortunately, is all pretty sad-looking and tasteless. The tomatoes were pale pink and mealy, rather than red and juicy, and all the other veggies appear to come straight from a can and are floating in water. Sure, they've got a decent variety of ingredients, but they're all pretty poor in quality. Plus, what's up with the salad greens selection? I want some arugula or some baby spinach! I'm not a huge meat-eater so I didn't add any meat to my salad, but all of the meat options looked pretty lifeless. I do appreciate the unlimited number of veggie toppings and that cheese and a few meat selections are without an additional charge, though. This makes the pricing reasonable, but I expect higher quality ingredients from a $7 salad.  I want someone to open a higher quality salad place in Oakland! I would go there all the time. Sweetgreen or Chop't would probably put Hello Bistro out of business, since there are other places to get burgers. It's times like these that I wish I spent all my time in Shadyside or something, but such is the life of a med student."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  This place is a joke.  Ambiance bad, restaurant acoustics are bad which makes it loud(!), not enough seating, food just so/so, EXPENSIVE(!) for what you get, etc.  I think people's reviews on here are maybe skewed just by having a new place to go.  I think the salad bar idea is good however the fact that a server/employee has to put the toppings on for you is silly.  It made me not want to get a salad.  I believe when the novelty wears off people will realize that this place is only so-so."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is owned by the people of Eat 'n Park. In my opinion it was a solid investment choice. I feel it has options for any food lover out there!"}
{"text":"Such a great choice for lunch! The salad bar is extensive and have almost everything you could wish for in it! Absolutely loved it! The milkshakes were also amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the best salads I have ever had. Perfect made to order salads. Good choices for toppings and dressings. About $8-9 for the salads but the portion sizes are big. Definitely worth the money. Not a big fan of their fries as they are oily. But overall good place to have salads in the campus."}
{"text":"I usually love coming in here but had a bad experience the last time I was here. I ordered the apple almond crunch salad, and ate a little before realizing there were less apples than usual. When I asked if I could have more apples the girl told me it couldn't be modified...after I already subbed out blue cheese for feta and almonds for craisins. WTF? I asked her if she was able to ask a manager and she did, they talked for a moment then completely ignored me until I felt awkward enough to go back to my table. A few minutes later she came out with a cup of apples. The manager was a grumpy looking middle aged guy and just didn't handle the situation well. Really? You're gonna argue with me about a quarter of an apple that's worth ten cents? Ridiculous. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice and filling salad even if you are not a salad person. Slightly sad that they made their bowls smaller form last year, but still a great place for food. I usually get a build your own salad where you can select anything from their wide selection salad bar. Ingredients are fresh and the salad is usually big enough for two meals.  A nice healthy option, I recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"2nd time to McCandless location. We love it! Endless salad ingredients, everything perfectly fresh. Salad bowl enough for 2.  Don't bother with the grilled cheese, just ok, not great. The fries were better the 1st time. Today they were way too done, crunchy, crispy. Need to reset timer on the fryer. Employees all very pleasant. Will go back again & again"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for fast dining and healthy options! I got a kale-quinoa-avocado salad for $7 and it was definitely quite a hefty portion! I also ordered a side of homemade fries, and although they were a little greasy for me, the taste was delicious. We struggled to find seating though since it was crowded, and I would say it is not a very conducive atmosphere for anything more than a casual meet up. This is my first time here, and I definitely will be coming again. It's new around my area and I'm super happy they are here and spreading!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have gotten a few different salads, all of which have been delicious.  It is a great quick lunch or dinner spot.  Recently found out they do breakfast/brunch as well but have not yet tried it.  Highly recommend if you are looking for something yummy and quick and much better than Panera."}
{"text":"Had the Quinoavocada salad. Very tasty & a great size potion for $7. Restaraunt was very clean & service was quick."}
{"text":"My first review ever. I ordered online and the order was to be ready around 4:20. I arrive at 4:20 and the staff continues to stand there and clean off the counters without any type of acknowledgment whatsoever. Finally someone comes over and I reply I'm waiting for an online order . She continues to tell me oh , the salad isn't made yet. Keep in mind there are TWO people in the entire place ! Insane. Lazy lazy lazy ."}
{"text":"I have never seen a place that committed to healthy living. The drinks had no preservatives or fake sugars. The napkins were recycled paper and the carry home containers were very sturdy recyclable plastic.   The food was very tasty and there were a lot of creative options. I got the Sesame Salmon salad and it was delicious. Also, the service was great, very friendly and helpful. I needed something and the guy immediately came over to see what I needed.   I wish we had one of these in central jersey. :-("}
{"text":"Good little Bistro/Burger joint in Pittsburgh. They primarily advertise burgers, salads and sandwiches. I had a standard burger which was on special and came with fries and a drink for under $10. That is hard to find in Pittsburgh. The burgers are thin so they were a little on the dry side but had enough flavor to stand up to the bun, toppings, and sauce. The fries were hand cut and very good.   The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was good. For the price this is a nice spot for a quick lunch or dinner downtown."}
{"text":"I will not go back since they removed the Asian sesame dressing from the menu. Disappointing because before that I was a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Used their online ordering to order a salad to pick up- then waited in line 40 minutes to get the salad!  Unacceptable. Don't offer a service if you can't meet the required expectations. Ridiculous.   Update to prior review- can't tell if this is better- online order, wait more than an hour for order to be ready and then still wait 25 minutes after designated pick up time to actually get my salad. I give up on this place."}
{"text":"Their burgers are just perfect. They tell the truth about what a burger needs to be. Simple. Prefect. Reasonably priced. Great job with this one eat n park! I'm officially addicted. oh and they have that e n p ranch. Can't forget that."}
{"text":"There for the first time and had something besides a salad. I opted for the burger and french fries. I got to John Wayne burger which comes with sautéed onions and barbecue sauce. The burger it's probably even worse than McDonald's burger and it was a very cheap burger. I would rather go to five guys any day of the week.  The fries were terrible. Way too much spice and salt. I could not even eat them. When ordering I asked if that would be in one order be enough to share with three people and they said yes. Clearly the people that work there have no clue because it was barely enough for one person no less sharing it for three people.  The worst part of the experience with how dirty the place was this is the first time we've ever dining in the restaurant and clearly all the college kids have no clue how to clean up. And the manager should know better and making it it's staff clean the place.   When we left the restaurant there was a employee cleaning the windows which was probably the last thing that needed to be done and they could be wiping up the tables cleaning up french fries all over the floors even the trash bin was overflowing it was disgusting.  We were the only ones in line and it took over 20 minutes to get two salads.  I will never be back again."}
{"text":"Didn't impress me the first time, but gave it another shot. Same poor results.   -Food: bland, small portions that don't justify the price. Had a breakfast sandwich the first time, and it was all bagel with little-to-no egg or meat. My girlfriend and I both got burgers the second time, and they were very disappointing given the hype they indicate on the menu and signage. Burgers were small, bland, and way over cooked. Best part was the bun, which engulfed and otherwise paltry piece of meat. Fries were awesome.   -Timing: took way, way too long. I understand the \"fresh\" aspect of the food, and respect that greatly, but if I knew I was going to wait 15 minutes for 2 small burgers in an otherwise empty restaurant, I would have gone somewhere else.   - Staff: somewhat friendly, but were much more worried about socializing in a group in the back corner.   -Atmosphere: awesome, great feel! Really like how they bring the food to you, even though it took much, much longer than expected.   Overall, I'm not sure I'd try Hello Bistro again. There are plenty of other options in the South Side, and I'll likely be taking my daily business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I adore this place and go there for lunch at least once a week.  They give you a huge portion for salads and the dressings are always great.  So glad to have this healthy option.  The pesto vinaigrette is great!"}
{"text":"One of the best salads i have ever had. honestly would recommend to anyone that will be in that area. it's a high quality salad for a good value. they also have unique drinks and lots of good options. you can even create your own salads"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to go if youre looking for a high quality salad for a fair price. enjoyed my meal very much here and have been there twice now."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger to-go. Staff were friendly and ordering process was super easy. I ordered the bistro burger and it took about 10 minutes for it to be brought out to me, which is fair for freshly made food. It was interesting that despite the to-go order, they gave me a number and told me to sit down at a table. Fortunately there were empty seats but I can imagine this might be tough if it's packed. The bistro burger was tasty, but the salt&pepper crust on the burger was way too salty. Maybe it was just a mistake on my burger, but they shouldn't be severely over salting burgers. Nonetheless, Hello Bistro will get another hello from me pretty soon to give them another chance. The build-your-own-salads are worth a shot.   Update: I went back to try the salad. I got to customize what I had it in and that's fun. After choosing everything, the salad is \"chopped\", mixed, and dressed by a chopper. I thought the personal service was really great. I got the feeling that the staff were genuinely interested in making the best salad for you. I ate the salad until I was full and had enough leftover so that by adding some lettuce, I had another lunch. I'm looking forward to saying Hello again to this place."}
{"text":"The food here is great! The wait time was ok. It took a long time to get our food. The people who ordered behind me got their meal first. That was the only downside. Other than that it is a very good place to eat. The wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Best and only build your own salad place in Pittsburgh. Generous on the toppings, which are unlimited anyway. Never a long wait. And they have a great selection of dressings. Best place to go for a giant affordable salad. Offer them a tip as they are not allowed to put the tip jar on the counter."}
{"text":"Big fan of the salads!  I wish they did not use so much plastic.  If you are eating in the restaurant they need a reusable dish.  Food is tasty!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about hello bistro recently so I decided to check it out. Not bad. The buffalo chicken salad was pretty solid. And they have really good French fries. There's a good mix of healthy food and not so healthy food... Overall, everything was pretty good"}
{"text":"Rolled in at 10am on a Sunday morning, excited to try some salads and burgers.  Staff was still asleep and hung over from the night before.   Friendly was a 2/10.  Atleast they turned on the music in the kitchen.  The overwhelming sentiment for todays visit would be that  this would be a great place to work if it werent for all of those pesky customers. Food 7/10 Service 2/10"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place salad place. You can get a pretty good variety of stuff just for $8. I used to go there regularly, until one fine day the realised they were running at a loss and decided to change the rules  1. They reduced the size of the salad boxes - not too bad, it is still pretty big for me.  2. This is the unstated rule that annoys me (and my friends) -  Half the box MUST be filled with lettuce. Now, when I told them I dont want lettuce (i dont LIKE lettuce), the senior guy (possibly the manager) goes into a long rant as to why they would lose money if it is not filled with lettuce. It would be useful if it is explicitly stated, so people like lettuce  dont go there. Why would anyone pay for something that they dont want to eat ?  3. They started reducing normal serving sizes (presumably to save cost)- these days, I find myself repeating \"some more, some more,some more....\" soo many times !  I wish they could revert back to the old 'Hello Bistro'."}
{"text":"Come to Hello Bistro for a fresh, healthy, affordable lunch. This is my new go to place in Oakland, where it can be hard to find veggies and leafy greens (among the dive bars, pizza, and burger joints that populate this area).  Salads are $7-9. They also serve burgers, bottled beer. You order at the counter and a staff member brings you your lunch (not sure how take out works). Modern, clean atmosphere. It was not crowded or busy at noon on Sunday during a 3 day weekend.  I like this place!"}
{"text":"This is the place for salads!  A giant river of toppings to choose from, fresh greens, giant bowl, and they'll chop your salad for you if you wish.  I had a small side salad, premade with greens, tomato, cucumber, cheese.  The Citrus Lime dressing is perfect....not too puckery or sweet, doesn't hide the flavors of the vegs.  I will absolutely get salads here in the future.  My burger wanted to be great.  It looked fantastic. The Big Honkin' Superburger, a double-decker with \"Sauce Supreme\", one patty was still incredibly red inside so I removed it.  The sauce really is nothing more than a very thin skim of tartar sauce.  It couldn't hide the fact that although the meat looked good and had a nice, juicy chew, there was no flavor to the meat.  None.  I saved a bite for later just to be sure, and nope, no flavor.  This is where the Eat 'n Park relationship is obvious. Your burger will need mustard, ketchup, or something.  My friend had the Over-Easy Cheeseburger, cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and an egg.  He said it was \"alright\" but less than expected.  The fries are very good, fried in peanut  oil.  My order was to go, so the fries were a bit limp but that was likely because they were in a bag for ten minutes. A lot of fries for just $2.  Milkshakes, chocolate and vanilla, are very standard.  Go to the Milkshake Factory at 17th and Carson for your shakes.  I plan on trying the breakfast sandwiches, and the Boylan soda fountain next time.  I do wish they'd have some pastries or muffins for breakfast....they just have those terrible Smiley cookie pucks.  I remain hopeful.  Eat 'n Park is the absolute worst chain restaurant I've ever been to, It makes Denny's taste gourmet. Hello Bistro needs to further distance themselves from Eat 'n Park and get some flavor in those burgers.  But if you're looking for a SALAD, this is your place."}
{"text":"Me and my GF ordered a salad and a burger today. Waited for a whole lifetime to get our food. I wish there's a 'negative star' review choice here."}
{"text":"I will never order from Hello Bistro online again.  I have ordered online several times and every single time the order is incorrect."}
{"text":"Our family frequently likes salads for lunch and dinner. Aside from the excellent burgers and steak options, the made to order salad bar  is simply over the top. Not only are all the ingredients custom selected, they are thoroughly mixed and chopped just the way you prefer.  Dressings are tossed into the salad making a fully uniform blend that is simply scrumptious. There are a series of meat options with various preparations also available to include with your salad.  Hello Bistro is a must try at the first opportunity."}
{"text":"Salads at hello bistro are vegetarian even if you order a protein. This is because the amount of chicken they add is so minuscule. I asked the manager to add more chicken to my buffalo chicken salad and she proceeded to show me exactly what two ounces of diced chicken looks like. It looks like (and is) seven small pieces of chicken.   Wow, what customer service! Is this how eat n park became the Pittsburgh icon that it is? Or maybe the manager with a died purple mohawk is not representative of an iconic company! How about hiring professionally looking and acting people for management positions. How about training management in customer service.   Speaking of hiring...the teenage girl that made my salad was twirling her ponytail over all of the toppings while several teenage boys watched her while their jeans were falling off their back sides. Maybe the purple mohawk manager could have asked the butt showing boys to sweep up all of the crap under the counters while the girl put her hair up under a ball cap or even a HAIR NET!  Thinking about going to hello bistro...DONT!"}
{"text":"Great customizable salad! For $10, you get a ginor-mo salad with protein and unlimited toppings, chop'd to your delight! The store also offers a good array of Boylan's sodas."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for dinner last week. The restaurant was typical of a college-area place, and the printed words everywhere (meal number, menu, napkins, etc.) reminded me of Chipotle.  I ordered the avocado burger; my boyfriend got the salmon burger and fries. The food took longer than I expected, considering the college-geared atmosphere. My burger was okay. It had the burger, red onion, a slice of avocado, a slice of cheese, and sauce. There was nothing special about it; also, the thick slice of avocado in only the middle of the burger made the sandwich really wide and awkward to eat. I thought the presentation--burger half-wrapped in foil--was cute, though.   I took a bite of the salmon burger, which was pretty good. However, the fries were soggy and not good at all. They came in a paper bag that was soaked in grease from the fries, which wasn't appetizing either.  If I come back, I'm going to try the salad bar, which seems much more interesting. They have many toppings to choose from, and the salad containers looked huge."}
{"text":"Salads are just OK. There are much better choices Downtown for about the same price. This was my second visit. The first time I didn't get the chicken in my custom salad. This time I waited 15 minutes for a menu-item salad before I inquired why it was taking so long. It was busy but everyone ahead of me and many behind me in line received their orders. The wait would have been worth it if the salad had not been mostly iceberg lettuce. That is not my definition of field greens. Won't be going back. The front staff and cashiers do an amazing job given the number of customers."}
{"text":"I love the salads here! At lunchtime the place is buzzing with Pitt students, but it's worth a wait. I can't wait for them to open more locations!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy at lunch time. Stood with my number (because there was nowhere to sit) for 20 minutes before they brought me my extremely simple to-go Greek chicken salad. Kind of an inefficient system. Food is okay, but with so many other places to eat downtown, I don't see what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"As you may be able to tell, by the line out the door at lunch, this place is darn good.  A small salad is the size of your head (dressing on the side please) and you can add 67 ingredients if you wish.  Oh, and beer, for the recalcitrant lunchers who want to add some OOMPH to their afternoon (or who want to be extra sleepy).  I haven't tried any sandwich yet - but the cobb salad is fantastic.  but, as referenced earlier, if you are not wanting to make a 400calorie salad into a 900 calorie stomach-bomb, ask for the dressing on the side.  And maybe my tongue is blanched from years of diet coke abuse - but I am not digging the boylan's.  I find it to be too sweet.  the root beer is good for the first few sips, but it quickly overwhelms the tastbuds - or mine at least..."}
{"text":"Bad experience! I would rather drink from the allegheny river than their coffee! Long wait, unprofessional staff and their oatmeal is sticky like chewing gum! Yuk! I would walk a but further to go to Pamelas diner!"}
{"text":"Waaay toooo slooooow.  It may be Sunday but they need more help obviously.  Waited 15 minutes for my order.  It's too bad because we actually enjoy the food. I usually frequent the store in the South Side, and the service is much better, even when the line is 3X the size of the one here.   Management - hire some more people. Thanks. Going on 20 minutes as I type this...  Edited. Going on 37 minutes now. Seriously."}
{"text":"Actually, the food itself delivers - I'm down on the queuing system or lack of. I ordered a salad and soup off the menu, and they provided made to order salads to 4 people behind me before I had to harass them to make mine. Not a good thing to watch when you're hungry and you actually paid more than those treated better."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and both times were great. I have yet to get a salad but I definitely want to, I love big salads with lots of toppings! I had the grilled cheese and the other grilled cheese with marinara and pepperoni, which was delicious. Quick friendly service, prices are great. I will definitely be making Hello Bistro a regular lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Fresh salad to die for. Really cool concept of assembling your own salad and toppings!! love it"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the wait was, at best, ridiculous.  It took almost 30 min to get a salad.  My family got their burgers in 20 minutes.  We were late to the movie beCause the food took so long."}
{"text":"My first experience at Hello Bistro was not good. I was feeling like an indulgent meal today so thought I'd give them a second chance.   My first trip I went with the salad. I love the idea of all the options, but the chaos surrounding the process, from what to do, the order that customers make their salads, and the lack of awareness of options was overwhelming. It was so crowded that the whole ordeal took some time. It's Oakland--lunch time is crazy. I get it.   My trip today, however, I went with a basic burger and fries. Thinking I would skip over the crazy salad process, I waited in the line (that was to the door) and patiently took a spot to wait for food. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. Over 30 minutes we waited for our orders. The restaurant was practically cleared out, everyone who ordered around us had come and gone, and we still had not received our food. A burger and fries should be basic, and the fastest thing they put out. Unfortunately, the one guy in the grill was so slow he was almost moving backwards, and the girl handing out the orders simply told us \"it's coming up shortly\".   I wish I could say that it was a one time crazy day, but it appears Hello has some staffing and efficiency issues. And while I love the Boylan soda they offer, I'm not willing to lose my entire lunch break waiting for an order to come up. Oh, and when I finally received the long-awaited burger, it was put together so haphazardly I had to remake it as the ingredients were outside the actual burger.   I won't be back until they get their act together or can at least put together a simple burger and fries properly."}
{"text":"Love the salads! Love the price!  For $7-8 you can eat your heart out of every vegetable possible...they have great topping choices like red quinoa, bean sprouts, artichokes, kalamata olives, edemame.  This is a vegetarian's dream..   Staff was friendly and accommodating and did not make me feel guilty about getting so many toppings.  The only draw back is the wait...but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Went there first time today. Waited 25 min for a salad and people behind me were already getting g theirs before me for some reason. I ordered tandoori chicken salad, supposed to have avocado and beets in it but nope. Not sure if they were trying to substitute over beets but paprika was in it instead (not on the menu). I made it to go so I couldn't return it."}
{"text":"I feel like I can't accurately comment on Hello Bistro because their big selling point is the made to order salads and I ordered a burger. Let's start with something simple and talk about seating. We went down here for a late lunch (1:30) one day. The place was packed, as most places in Oakland are. We ordered take out. The problem with this is you have to find a place to locate yourself until your take out order is ready. There were no table and no barstools available so we ended up awkwardly asking a group if we could hang at their table for a few minutes until our orders were ready. Luckily they were quick and our order was up within five minutes. I ordered the avocado veggie burger and fries as a side. It was nothing special and I could literally make a better burger at home. Maybe I'm just kind of a burger snob because I find most burger places to be highly unsatisfactory (Burgatory, such a disappointment). This burger was just a standard veggie patty, a slice of swiss cheese, an overabundance of onion, two chunks of avocado and some ketchup. It was kind of bland. The fries were extremely greasy. My friend ordered a salad and her food was actually much better. This place is definitely at it's best when you get a salad. You can personalize it however you'd like.  I had a few bites and the salad seemed to be a much tastier option. I was just lured in by the promise of a burger with avocado. Next time I'm sticking with salads and that's that!  I think this place is a little bit pricey for the quality you're getting but it looks like I'm in the minority on that one. Not my favorite place in Oakland but not the worst either!"}
{"text":"I loved it. The place was clean. The girl behind the counter was super friendly and helped me put together a delish vegan lunch for myself. It has been around for a while now and I had heard good things so I'm glad I stopped in. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Coming into Hello Bistro with only 2 people in front of me I thought the process of getting a salad would be relatively painless, but I was wrong. I ordered a pre-designed salad WITH DRESSING ON THE SIDE. Not a complicated order.  My salad then proceeded to sit on the counter waiting to be mixed for at least 15-20 minutes. All the workers were in the back/kitchen clearly just talking considering the restaurant had a total of 5 people in it.  Someone finally noticed I had been waiting for going on 25 minutes now, they proceeded to dump about half a bottle of dressing on my salad. The worker unapologetically handed me the salad after the 35 minute ordeal. And of course, the salad was disgusting due to the gallon of dressing on top. It was more of a dressing soup. I would have been better off waiting in the lengthily chipotle line. I probably would have been done faster and at least my order would have been done right. Worst $10 ever spent. I will not be reuniting"}
{"text":"Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won't be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Only 3 employees visibly working. 1 cleaning. 1 on register and \"making\" salads with about as much gusto as the piece of old lettuce on the ground next to the garbage can. 1 line cook. The salad line was indescribably gross and looked like a hurricane had blown through: cauliflower in the radishes and so on. If I had realized the uncleanliness of it before I paid I wouldn't have stepped foot in here. No manager seemingly on duty or present the entire day based on the look of the place. This restaurant has so much potential given location and such, but they are falling dangerously short more than 50% of the time."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a lot of times and they are usually extremely slow for a salad place. Today just really took the cake. I waited for over an hour (no I'm not exaggerating) for my to go salad. I had to say something to the employees just to get them to make it. On top of that I barely got an apology. I wanted a salad to go because I have a busy schedule. Not to sit in hello bistro for an hour. They either need to add more employees or train their staff to be quicker. So unacceptable.   On a positive note the salads are priced well."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to find this juice place! I juice my own kale, celery, and apple juice and eat lots of veggies at home. It's very difficult to eat well while traveling. Salad gets boring after a while and when it does juices/smoothies are good alternatives. I had a detox smoothy today and it tasted very good. I'll definitely go back every day during my stay in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Finally a breath of fresh air in Oakland! Great for college students because of both the value and quality of the food.  For a set price, plus additional charges for meat, you can get a delectable salad with endless ad ins.  They customize the salad even down to the size you want your bites to be.  Definitely a must-try in Oakland, there is nothing else like it!"}
{"text":"Went in around 1230 and ordered a pre-chosen salad option thinking it would be faster since I did expect the lunchtime crowd and for them to be busy. People ordered, came....and went! Waited 25 min (I think they forgot about me). Checked in an woman said it will be right up. Told her I had waited over 20 min (nicely). Got salad. No apologies or anything. Salad was underwhelming but I might just be bitter about the wait!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! First time ever at a Hello Bistro and the woman that made my salad was very helpful and knowledgable. 5 stars and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice place. New too me. Too bad I didn't realize I needed to ask for lettuce and tomato for my burger, but the salads look more than amazing. I'll come back again and it will def be a salad for me."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite location of the three, which is a shame because I love Hello Bistro and spending time in South Side. Unfortunately, for some reason they don't offer regular salmon for their salads, only Moroccan spiced. I came here for dinner last night and was disappointed because the other two locations offer plain salmon. I ended up not ordering anything, and my boyfriend ordered a burger without mayo to go. When we got home and he opened it up, it was slathered in mayonnaise. As much as I love South Side, I probably won't be back since I can't get my favorite menu item."}
{"text":"How much did I love their whole team?  My coworker and I ordered salads, everyone there was beyond friendly!  We went to the Oakland location and Fede was our chopper and she was such a sweetheart!  Keep up the great work, everyone! We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This location is a disaster.  I went on a very uncrowded day between xmas and new years, where the number of employees exceeded the number of customers in line.  I ordered the special salad, but the cashier was not familiar with the specials and had to go check to see how to ring it up.  I then waited 32 minutes for the salad.  That's right, 32 minutes.  It involved nothing special.  People behind me in line got theirs (rather unhappily) before me, about 25 minutes out.  I asked what was happening because I had an appointment and I was met with rudeness.    The problem is that people can order salads online and pick them up. I've done this several times to great success. But now I see how that works--it is at the cost of the customer that orders in the store.  I had to wait for dozens (literally dozens) of salads to be made for people that were not in line.  I have never seen so many people in such disarray and unorganized.  Everyone working there appeared to be confused and disoriented.   i will never go back.  It is not just the 32 minute wait for beets, precooked chicken, and lettuce to be mixed up, but the general rudeness and disorganization of the place.    I would avoid this place at all costs, unless you are ordering online.  If ordering online, it is a halfway decent salad."}
{"text":"just to update my review. My visit did not change, my review will not change but they did reach out to me and have tried to \"make it better\" by being willing to give me credit to the establishment and to try it again. unfortunately, I can't since this was a visit during a business conference and unless there is one near me, this gift card will not be used. But I did appreciate their concern and willingness to let me \"try\" them again and see if they couldn't sway my idea of their establishment. good luck and thank you for your reaching out to me. This gift card will be sent to someone that lives in that area and maybe they will have a better time with it."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from here a few times a month. I haven't had issues until recently. Last week, I get my salad and it's missing the chicken. Today, I'm here waiting for my to go order and the man in the back is cutting onions with no gloves on, yuck.  They also didn't pack my extra dressing on the side but I caught it before leaving. P  So when you order online double check your order before you leave. Prep work not sure how you check how cleanly that is for the day. :-/"}
{"text":"Don't order online and don't order a signature salad. Make your own or they'll screw it up and ruin your lunch break."}
{"text":"While the unlimited toppings,huge size, and taste of the salads are bang-on great, this place needs to get a handle on their growth and popularity before more people simply decide it's not worth the time or hassle.  I placed an order today at 11:39am for pickup at 12:14pm. At 12:50, the salad wasn't even started yet. I finally got my salad at 1pm.  If you're like me, a mere mortal, and you have limited time for lunch, this is NOT the place for you!  Great salads but they really have to work on their systems!"}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like Hello Bistro more than I do, especially considering how much my wife does. But every time I leave I'm stuck on the fence. The concept is pretty straight-forward, and the prices are the main attraction.  Considering there are usually 15-20 people working, you'd think the system would be a little more seamless, but something is always out of sorts. Orders get mixed up on the line, ingredients are missing, and I've generally dealt with some unpleasant employees.  The burgers are hit or miss, but the fries are right up my alley. And for nostalgia-sake it's nice to get the grilled cheese with tomato soup every now and again, and throw in a milkshake for good luck.  For a cheap lunch that keeps the wife happy, I can't go wrong. I'll be back, but hopefully the concept as a whole continues to improve."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the fast casual layout of this place. There is nothing fast about it. Though the salads are good, it took 45 minutes from the moment I walked in the door to the moment I walked out with ONE salad ordered from their suggested menu. Meanwhile, build your own salads are being made and take out orders are being picked up. A full 25 minutes of idle wait time.   If you're under any kind of time constraint skip this place. Not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience here. They were very accommodating when I asked about vegan options. They asked nearly the entire staff to figure out if the veggie burger was vegan which was incredibly nice, its vegan by the way without the mustard. They were also knowledgeable about what is vegan or not! It was good, I just wish there was more lettuce/greens or tomatoes in the burger. My friends the non-vegans also enjoyed their meals, and they liked the plates they came on."}
{"text":"I have visited multiple hello bistro locations and have always had a pleasant experience. This was a great addition to the south hills! Made to order salads with unlimited toppings! So many things to choose from. I will say the service was a little slow today, but it seemed to be because this is a brand new location and there was a lot of employee training going on. The employees were all so friendly and the restaurant was unbelievably clean. I plan to be a regular now that it's closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent guest at other Hello Bistro locations and today was my first time at this new location. First off, the avocado I ordered was missing-- kinda annoying because you pay extra but whatever. There was also barely any of the other items I ordered in it.. one carrot, little to no quinoa, etc. what really turned me off is there was a few random pieces of ham and chicken, none of which I ordered. I pretty much stopped eating after that. I think I'll go to Whole Foods next door the next time I'm crazy a good salad."}
{"text":"I've been on campus for two years now and this is the first time I've gone to Hello Bistro but now that I've gone I can't stop going. Although, I still have yet to have their salad I can say how I absolutely love their burgers and even their grilled cheese. It's definitely not just a place for salads but all kinds of food.   I would not necessarily recommend their milkshakes but if you're in the mood for one then it's not bad. They also have spiked milkshakes which could make it even better."}
{"text":"First time here, prices are fair, burgers are too greasy. I'll probably take a salad next time.   The place looked a little unkept"}
{"text":"First time here, it was great very surprised on the sizes and freshness.. Make a pretty good salad and even the price is not bad for everything you get. They are not stingy with their stuff. They were busy and the manager was there ( idk her name ) she was also making salads n helping her staff . Will come back !! Loved my salmon salad !!"}
{"text":"SO good. Anything you want ready for your salad. The veggie burgers and fries are delicious. Plus eat and park ranch is AMAZING. I love this place."}
{"text":"I like to frequent Hello Bistro because it is a great option for healthy eaters like myself who do not want to break the bank, and its casual dining area and fast casual style make it convenient when you're on the go. The service is quick and the menu options are unique and flavorful. My personal favorite is the Barbecue Chicken Salad because of its crunchy tortilla strips and delicious sweet-yet-spicy barbecue sauce. In the winter, I spring for the Winter Greens Salad, which is a nice light option when holiday meals have you feeling sluggish. The greatest thing about the Hello Bistro salads? They have the perfect dressing-to-salad ratio EVERY TIME! Probably because their unique chopping technique coats every lettuce leaf with the right amount of dressing. Obviously from my experience I have yet to try their hot food options, like their burgers and sandwiches, but I have stolen french fry or two off of my friends plates and I can say with certainty that Hello Bistro is just as good cooking hot food as they are crafting salads."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was ready fast and it was delicious. I got a Chicken Caesar Salad which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be! It was a generous size, and I wasn't able to finish the whole thing. My boyfriend had a Mushroom and Onion Burger which was also good. The fries were delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I never really had pleasant experiences here with the employees. Usually they all were rude, didn't use manners, and seemed annoyed when a customer walked through the door.   This all changed though with my recent visit to Hello Bistro. I ordered a salad with chicken and it was around $10. Not bad! I love getting the salad because  1) it's HUGE. Like meals for 3 days huge.  2) it's fresh. You can see how fresh everything is because they make it right in front of you  3) they chop it up so finely. I'm a weirdo when it comes to salads and I love them finely chopped and I love that they ask you how you want it.   This salad was seriously perfect. I'm so obsessed with hello bistro and I definitely have a better taste in my mouth after this visit. The employees got all of their stuff together and were SO polite. They'd actually cared about what I wanted, and they SMILED. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the salads that they offer! I got the cucumber watermelon chicken salad which was great. Too many hot peppers so will ask for less next time. They also said this salad with the cumin vinaigrette was soy free so win for me! I have not asked or tried anything else there yet to know if it's safe or not. #soyfreefriendly"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the salad that I got at Hello Bistro today--the ingredients were nice and fresh and there were tons of options to add to your salad.  It's a nice addition to the Oakland area lunch options, and I think it was pretty reasonably priced for the size of the salads.  I also was a big fan of the Boylan Soda machine--it's nice to have different selections for fountain drinks.  The only complaint I have was how crowded it seemed to be--like there were too many people working all at once.  It was also hard for the staff to hear you as you ordered things to put in the salad, but I ended up with everything on my salad that I wanted--so I can't complain too much, but I can imagine this problem only getting worse when all the students return to both Pitt and CMU."}
{"text":"Loud ... chaotic ... did I mention loud ...  There were as many people behind the counter as in the dining room and outdoor patio.  Very industrial decor ... not much in way of sound barriers ... not a place for a lunch meeting.  I had the shrimp avocado black bean corn salad.  Everything was chopped .... it was ok ... mixed greens would have elevated the meal.  The potato soup was watery.  .....  Trying to eat healthier (w/o doing the chopping),  I have visited this restaurant multiple times recently for takeout. I have been very pleased with the variety of options (ex. Citrus lime vinegarette).   It is running like a well oiled machine.  The noise level hasn't changed."}
{"text":"Every time I order a salad off their menu to go, they never put the cheese on it that it is supposed to come with. This has happened three times is that I have gotten home and they did not put the cheese on the salad. I don't get what is so hard about reading the ingredients listed and putting them all in the salad. I like the food but when I can't even get my right order it is very annoying."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've always enjoyed my salad. I really like the Boylan sodas too!  However, last time I was there, I took half my salad to go and tossed it in the refrigerator. Not even an hour later, when I went to finish the salad, it was covered in mold. I'm not sure if that was just a fluke but it has me hesitating to go back."}
{"text":"Had the Sriracha turkey burger pretty good..... Had it with a enormous side salad..... Good iced tea selection.... My moms fries were great..... They also provided ranch dipping sauce at condiment bar"}
{"text":"I've always had quick and prompt service at this location. The food is great for fast casual and especially for make your own salads. Nice indoor and outdoor seating. Ive seen people bring their dogs in the warm weather to the outdoor section so I would consider it dog friendly."}
{"text":"I frequent the downtown location and sometimes the McCandless one. The food is good and I always enjoy the option to order online ahead of time. However, the downtown one has never been great at having online orders ready for the time you pick, and the last time I was there it was worse than ever. I arrived about 5 mins ahead of my pick-up time, and thank goodness I did, because I waited in the line to get to the register for about 15-20. So when I got to the register I was already 10-15 mins past my pick-up time. I waited for another 5 until the cashier came to the counter, and then an additional 5 while she searched for my order, which ultimately had not been made yet. I had my daughter with me for lunch and was working in a relatively short window to get her fed and back to daycare, and me back to work (which is why I order and pay ahead of time). They said they moved my order to the front of the queue and told me they'd bring it out. We then went on the hunt for a table, and finally found one, only to sit and wait ANOTHER 20 mins for our food. Then when it arrived, the kid's meal was wrong and we had to track someone down to have it fixed. I stopped coming here because I couldn't take the waits anymore. I thought I saw something recently that they had changed the pick-up process so that credit card payments were required and orders would be waiting on a shelf for you to grab & go -- I confirmed the CC one but is the order shelf accurate as well? That would be so much better."}
{"text":"Seasonal salad with apples and pears was excellent. Quinoa salad needed more flavor. Over easy hamburger was very good. Fries are best when very hot."}
{"text":"Great salads with lots of options for pre made and customized salads, but service needs to be improved. I have ordered in person and waited 20 minutes for salad, and ordered online to save time and arrived to find my order not ready and another 10 minutes to prepare, after placing my online order an hour before. I understand a lunchtime rush, but other places manage better. Not great to stop in if you have a tight schedule and/or value your time, especially for a place that seems fast casual. Order online but beware of long wait times!"}
{"text":"I stopped in around 1pm on a Friday. The restaurant was quite busy. I ordered the avocado burger then filled up my cup at the boylans soda fountain- a nice touch. I was hungry when I came in and approaching hangry 20 minutes later when I finally got my burger. The burger was more than decent and the price was good, but the place was dirty (trash and spills on the soda fountain, un-bussed tables) and the wait was quite long. I'd probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"This place take forever, i order a burger and fires and it took them 30 min, the problem is they were not even. Busy at all,  the food is good but it is the same as eat n park. I also think it is over priced. Never again"}
{"text":"Food was made fast and everyone there was nice. I had a bad experience at one of the other locations so I wanted to give them another chance, food was good service was good"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was good. I got a roasted root salad. My wife built her own. The little juice place attached to HB is fantastic. I'd recommend stopping over there. But the service at Hello Bistro... abysmal.  I purposely ordered and paid ahead online so that I wouldn't be stuck waiting long. It's a Friday lunch hour downtown - places get crazy. But when you order and pay ahead at places that offer it, you don't expect a wait... especially not 25 extra minutes!! And it wasn't just the long line at the take-out pick-up counter. When I finally got to the head of the line, our salads had JUST been made. They were supposed to have been ready 25 minutes earlier. So if we had been able to get to the head of the line when our food was expected to be prepared, we would still have been waiting for it to be made. The gentleman in front of me had ordered ahead as well. His food wasn't even ready. The response from staff? \"Yea. We're just hectic back here.\"  Every establishment is hectic at lunch on Fridays downtown. Get it together.  I don't know that I'll return."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Hello Bistro has finally moved to the North Hills and Wexford. Their salads always taste so fresh and you get a ton of food.   I went at lunch time on a Thursday and there was no wait, although it did start getting a little more traffic closer to 1. I keep on getting the Caribbean Shrimp salad because I'm afraid I'll regret it if I venture away. The dressing is light and citrusy and having everything chopped up together, you get all flavors in every bite.   Along with about 5 or 6 signature salads, there is a build your own option with not limit on toppings (!) the price point is averaged at between $9-$10 for a salad, and like I said, they definitely don't hold back on the salad size."}
{"text":"I love salad but I find that most lunch salads never really fill you up for that long. This is not the case at Hello Bistro. For about 8 bucks they will pack an unlimited number of vegetable, fruit, and crunchy toppings into a generously sized bowl for you. For 2 bucks more you can add meat. Then it is all chopped and dressed right in front of you. The end result is a fresh and filling salad. Its not the best salad you'll ever have but its nice to be able to load up on lots of veggies and toppings without breaking the bank.  FYI: This place becomes an absolute madhouse at lunch time. Its best to order online or show up well before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"If you all are wondering why the staff here seems cranky and tired, look no further than the manager, Jessica Boff, who is rude, passive-aggressive, and looking for her staff to work like robots. The place is severely understaffed because Boff is ready to fire people at the drop of a hat when they don't perform perfectly or have to reschedule shifts. Most of the staff are college students and have to prioritize schoolwork, which she knows, but does not seem to care about. She needs to be fired. Other than that, the food is okay, but this place DESPERATELY needs a new GM."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot! I work in Oakland and my coworkers and I visit this place often.  It gets crowded during the lunch rush so we try to get there by 11:45 to beat the crowd. I always choose the pick your own salad and for $7 and it is a deal. For an extra $1 you can add a half avocado and for a few more bucks you can add some protein. They offer every kind of salad topping you could want from cheeses to all kinds of olives. The fruit and veggies are always fresh and they are over generous in the amounts of toppings added to your salad. The staff is always friendly and will ask how you want your salad chopped.  I have not tried anything else but the salads but they burgers look delicious and I think worth a try.  I recommend signing up for their emails as they are so funny, you get a coupon for doing so and one for your birthday."}
{"text":"I love their veggie burger! Absolutely delicious. Their sweet potato fries and salads are amazing as well.  Only thing I don't like about this place is their prices. 10 bucks for a salad. Granted, the quantity is big, but not within a budget of a college student."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I think the salad bar is nice, but I don't understand charging  $8 for something that is 90% lettuce. Everyone else seems to think this is cheap though so what do I know. I have had the burgers twice and each time they were surprisingly greasy, almost too greasy. The place is nice and clean though and the unique soda fountain is nice. Warning to anyone with peanut allergies, the fries are cooked in peanut oil."}
{"text":"Let me start my review off by saying that my husband and I really enjoy the food here, and have been coming since they first opened.  But the service is just beyond terrible, literally getting worse each time we come.  Last time I went the guy making my salad knocked over the salad container and attempted to picked it all up, even stuff that fell on the floor until I called him out on it. I was baffled.  My husband has a shellfish allergy, and they do have shrimp on the toppings bar, so we notified them immediately.  Yet the cashier in no way notifies the person making the salad, so saying something is worthless   Not to mention dirty tables and trash everywhere.  They're obviously too busy for the unexperienced, young workers to handle   They really need to step it up. We should really stop going, but the salads are so good!"}
{"text":"Top place to get salad to go.  Create your own because its the best way to get the toppings you want...lots of choices prepared for you just point as you go...I love it.   My favorite is how they chop the salad to your request personally I like small bites. The citrus vinigrette (may have been lime) is really good and the \"salad maker\" asks you how much dressing you want...it comes out perfect every time!  I'm such a salad lover!  Wish it was all healthy but I love my cheese.  Not sure who is ordering burgers here I mean really you burger ordering loonies its all about salad here."}
{"text":"Perfect salads! I went there for lunch and ordered the Caribbean shrimp salad. I don't usually have salads but I've gained some weight last two weeks so I decided to add salads on my diet this week. And as a person who HATES greens, I would highly recommend their salad to everyone! The food tastes fantastic and the salad size is huge that anyone can be satisfied!"}
{"text":"I really love Hello Bistro, where there's the most delicious salad I have ever eaten. I usually choose shrimp/steak salad by you, which means I can select food I love. There are a lot of types of fruit, vegetable, and crunchies. I always choose Apple Cider dressing and it's very delicious. I must recommend Hello Bistro as the best salad to others."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I ordered the Rockin' Moroccan Caesar Salmon salad and it was above average. Today I tried the Original Superburger and Fries. Burger is good, classic $5 burger and hot unlike the bag of fries. It was barely room temperature and the manager brought it to me herself. Upon informing them of the cold fries and requesting another order, not one person apologized. Instead, someone on the line, agreeing \"yea we need to make new fries\"  ....10minutes later still waiting for my fries   I left after 15minutes with no fries"}
{"text":"I used the online order option. It was easy to use, and didn't have to register. I made my own salad. I was surprised all the toppings were listed. My order was ready when I got there. I actually liked my salad more to go than eating there. Everything was fresh. I didn't order any meat on it, but the veggies were tasty. I had the sweet potatoes as one of the toppings. Great flavor!"}
{"text":"After I moved away from Pittsburgh I never realized how much I under-appreciated the concept of Hello Bistro. Prices are beyond reasonable for all you can eat toppings that are consistently fresh... Those who are in Pittsburgh, you don't realize how lucky you are!!   I'm surrounded by salad chains that are more expensive AND limit you to four toppings (I'm talking about you Sweet Greens and Chop't)! After I eat at these places I get sad and wish I could be back in Pittsburgh get Hello Bistro."}
{"text":"After strong deliberation of where to eat for lunch in Oakland, we found ourselves at Hello Bistro and I'm glad we did.  Although they have hamburgers and fries, which might be good, the reason to go is the build your own salad for a base of $7.50 currently.  If you add protein in the form of chicken, etc. it is an additional cost, but it isn't needed.  There is enough options to replace the meat in black beans, garbanzo beans, edamame that you won't miss the beef or chicken.  Obviously price is an opinion whether it is worth it or not, but for me, the price wasn't bad at all especially compared to other restaurants in the area to get salads.  The other complaint is that EnP is the parent company and same ingredients.  Although I have not been to HB much, the produce looked \"fresher\" than the pale looking produce at your local EnP, or maybe it is just mine where the produce used as decoration looked more edible than some of the stuff on the salad bar.  Also, a lot of the items used at EnP said \"EnP\" next to them, like the ranch dressing or cookies specifically stated EnP.  I have never seen Pesto Vinaigrette at EnP.  If you are still with me and are curious, this is how it works even though i was a little confused at first.  This build your own salad is for one price with protein being the only addition item.  There is no circling what you want and handing them the card or curious if the roasted corn is 50 cents more than the regular corn.  Basically, you pay and off you go.  First, they ask what type of lettuce you want (mixed greens, romaine, iceberg) then they head over to where all the toppings are and you just go crazy telling them everything you want (I had broccoli, cauliflower, egg, bacon, roasted corn, roasted root veggies, granny smith apples, edamame, fresh mozzarella, and kalamata olives).  Second, they pass you on to what I describe as \"the chopper.\"  I'm not sure if that is the official title or not but they ask if you want your salad chopped small, medium, or large.  I love this step because instead of eating giant leaves of lettuce, it can be cut small.  Also, at this step they add the crunchies of which i had the toasted garbanzos and sunflower seeds.  Finally this person asks what type of dressing and how much or if  you want it on the side.  I watched as he dressed it to just the right amount, enough to coat the salad but not too much to form a lettuce soup.  Also, if you want more after the fact, you can go back and ask for more.  I had the pesto vinaigrette, which was good, but i would probably try another type next time.  I know people have said the salads are huge, and this is definitely the case.  The pictures don't do it justice.  As an added bonus, Boylan's in the fountain.  Even though I don't drink soda anymore, i almost had to get it to try the Birch Beer or the Cherry."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro usually hits the spot for me whether it's a salad or their delicious French fries! The detail put into your salad is excellent, and there are SO MANY options---chop size, dressings, cheese, proteins, whole or half lemon, so on and so forth! The French fries are so tasty and crispy! Many people pass by the mini smiley cookies---don't pass them by; they're a nice finish (or start) to your meal especially for $.50 :)"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is another hit from parent company Eat N' Park. They offer burgers, salads, sandwiches, soap and even build your own salads. On this particular visit my girls and I came for the burgers however.  My wife and I both chose the Original E'nP Superburger with fries and our daughter chose the Mushroom & Onion Jack Burger with fries. A few minutes later our food was on the table. My wife and I's burgers were just as good as ever as they were always our go to's at Eat N' Park. The fries were delicious also. Our daughter was quiet the whole time so I take it she enjoyed her burger as well!  It's nice to have a different option for burgers other than Burger King or Wendy's. Next time I will try one of their salads as they sound very good as well!"}
{"text":"good spot if you want a fairly priced salad and homemade French fries! they also have really good burgers and amazing flavors of soda! I had previously gotten the BBQ chicken salad and it was bomb, but this time I got the apple almond salad and it wasn't very good. Too much lettuce and not very colorful, looked bland and tasted bland. service was slow but it was crowded so I guess that was fine. I'll go back and try more."}
{"text":"Went here for my hubby\"s birthday with kids. We all got burgers and everyone loved what they got. Great service and ambiance. Not sure why the reviews are so poor."}
{"text":"If you walk in here during the lunch hour on a typical work week, you have to be prepared and know what you're getting into, that's all. Yes, it's a bit chaotic, it's busy and it's loud. But the amount of salad you actually get is pretty stellar for the price.   I've been here a few times now and the staff has always been pleasant - especially the choppers! I appreciate the array of options and that you can control the ingredients in your salad.   Am I an everyday-er? No. But some days this certainly hits the spot."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Eat'n Park in Grove City with my friends. It was a good place to hang out late at night and order whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted. For this reason, it was comforting to discover Hello Bistro, a more hip offshoot of Eat'n Park, within walking distance of my workplace. I love the chili and potato soup. It's so comforting. I used to order those all the time at ENP. Their salad bar is huge and has as many options as you could possibly think of. What really draws me to this place is the Boylan's soda fountain. How cool is that? I love Boylan's soda, but sometimes it's hard to find. I wish they served regular root beer, but they have birch beer, black cherry, and ginger ale which are satisfying enough (and free refills!). It's a great lunch option in Oakland, whether you're lunching alone, getting food to go, or meeting up with a friend.  UPDATE - 4/27/16 - I would recommend only going here in the afternoon when a manager is around and things are stocked and the staff is on point. I went here for dinner at around 7 p.m. a week ago and the vegetables (and eggs?) were frozen, they were out of dried cranberries and other items, and the service was pretty bad. The students working clearly felt like they had better things to do than helping customers. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and it seems to get worse with each visit. They never have enough people to make salads and the ones they do have are unhappy to be there, don't speak English, or don't know the items on the salad bar (artichokes & beets look nothing alike and when asking for quinoa - I had to tell them which container it was in). This place has a long way to go!!!"}
{"text":"The service was so bad and unorganized I don't know where to start. I ordered online at 12 and at 12:50 when I got there, they hadn't even looked at it. A woman was standing there who had ordered at 10:30 for 12:00. It got so bad that several people left without their food after already paying because they had to go back to work. They are so busy with the people in the salad bar line that everyone else gets shoved to the side. I understand it is lunch hour downtown, however all restaurants are busy at this time downtown and I have never seen this type of chaos anywhere else."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro offers a variety of fresh and and amazing toppings for their salads. Whenever I go I usually make my own salad. The toppings are absolutely incredible and the salads themselves are so big you can easily get two meals out of it. However, please allot plenty of time as the salad bar line can take up to 15 minutes by the time it's all chopped and mixed. It is on the pricier side, but you get to put as many toppings as you would like. I highly recommend and it's one of the bests casual restaurants in Oakland."}
{"text":"The concept of the salads is pretty cool. Any of the other food items are pretty much straight from the Eat'n Park menu. The food is pretty consistent with any other Eat'n Park so it's hit or miss. One thing about this location though - it stinks, literally. They open their garage door/windows in the summer time and it just smells like a really dirty wet rag when you walk past. It's as if they used one dirty rag to clean the entire place over and over again. If you can get past the smell, the food is ok. Otherwise, just make the extra effort and go to an Eat'n Park diner outside of downtown."}
{"text":"First let me say they opened last week so I understand there may be some kinks to work out but it was pretty bad. From the first moments inside we felt a sense confusion and of being rushed.  I ordered a burger, fries and a side salad and told to go to the dressing station and someone will get you the dressing of your choice along with an order number to put on the table.  I waited in line for 10 minutes at the dressing station before interrupting someone to get my dressing (my meal was delivered to me while waiting in line).  The place was packed and we waited another 10 minutes for a table to clear. You could see many unhappy faces from the customers but the staff was remarkably upbeat. The food: Their marketing reads \"Yes, we've been flippin' burgers since 1949 - you don't do something for that long without getting preeeetty good at it.\".  The burger tasted like a processed frozen burger from a cafeteria, it was bland & spongy. The salad was nice but the red wine vinaigrette tasted like something out of a bottle.  Not what I was expecting.  If you're looking for good burgers, walk a bit further and go to 5 guys.  If you like salads they have a great selection but I suspect the dressings are pretty much off the shelf. Someone that I had lunch with told me said the food is straight from Eat and Park so if that's your taste you might like it."}
{"text":"When I found out this place was a child of Eat n' Park I knew I had to check it out.   The format is a little different than I thought it would be, you place your order, walk through the line of toppings and dressings then the employee chops and mixes it all together and you are done!   I decided on the Fiesta Chicken salad over making my own and paired it with a cup of the Potato Soup. After sitting down with my drink, about 5 minutes later my order arrived. The Portion of the salad is HUGE! I am a bigger guy and could only eat half saving the other half for later.  The soup was a perfect temp and helped with the cold snowy weather outside. The staff were all courteous and helpful and the atmosphere had a cafeteria vibe.   My friend had a Superburger with Fries and he also said it was good and reasonably priced.   If you are in the mood for a large salad with a wide selection of toppings, or a burger or grilled cheese, definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is a nice concept for a college town.  It like and express Eat N Park with a very limited menu.  They had salads with a great selection of topics!  It was like a salad bar but the staff prepares your salad for you (much more sanitary than the traditional salad bar).  They also had a nice selection of burgers.  The burgers are cooked like Eat N Park burgers (they are cooked well, you cannot choose how you want your burger cooked)  The staff was friendly, the layout was nice.    I wish they had a few more options on the menu and I wish they served Eat N Park cookies!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place has moved in near my work! I have been hearing great reviews, and chopped salads are always a great choice for any meal! I had the BBQ chicken salad, which is one of about 8 pre-made salads. It was very good - the dressing was a BBQ citrus dressing, which was honestly more delightful than I was expecting. The ingredients were fresh, and the dressing to salad ratio was on point. You can also make your own salad from a list of tons of toppings!  They also have a few burgers and sandwiches on the menu consistently, with some specials that seem to change. I saw a peach brie grilled cheese sandwich that I would be interested to try, so I am excited to see what other seasonal eats they bring to the menu!   I want at lunch, and there wasn't a ton of people which was nice. We went through the line quickly, and were able to find a seat with no trouble. I left with half the salad leftover, and it was still great when I ate it the second time around!"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro recently opened right down the road from our home. We have heard mixed reviews from friends and coworks and decided to try it out for ourselves. My husband and I went for lunch, around 11:15am and the place was pretty empty. Their menu was laid out nicely with salad combinations created by the company, made-to-order salads, sandwiches and burgers. The variety of the menu was appealing. In addition, the layout of the restaurant was nicely done as the salad bar was labeled and displayed for customers to easily choose their items and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate large crowds.   I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and wasn't overly impressed with it. While the salad dressing had a zing of freshness to it, the rest of the ingredients did not have that fresh quality. The lettuce tasted like it was out of the bag, the corn, while having grill/roasted marks on it, could have been from a can, and the minimal amount of chicken scattered throughout the salad was pretty tasteless. Though I felt the size of the salad was acceptable for the price, the ingredients did not meet that same expectation. My husband ordered the Broccauliflower Grilled Cheese which tasted good, however his remark after eating it was \"we could make this at home\". Yes, we could make it at home multiple times for the price of that one sandwich he just devoured. If you simply want french fries to go with the sandwich, make sure you have an extra $2 on hand.   As we were getting ready to leave, around 12pm, the place was half full and the line was almost to the door. I'll give it to Hello Bistro for doing their part in providing society with a healthier option for lunch and dinner. Overall, I am glad we tried it, and I will give it another chance down the road."}
{"text":"I ate here while visiting my daughter at college.  Hands down my fave salad place ever!  I wish so much there was a Hello Bistro in Maryland near me.  I would eat salads from this place every single freakin' day...lunch and dinner!!"}
{"text":"I love the create your own salads. You can get as many toppings as you'd like, and they toss it right in front of you. I gave them a 4, because I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup once. The soup was cold, so I haven't ordered it again."}
{"text":"Do not order online! I ordered a salad with salmon (a whopping $3 addition) online, but when I got the salad, there was no salmon to be found in it at all! Since I live a 45 minute walk from Hello Bistro, I don't feel like trekking all the way back in the rain to complain. If you don't want to get ripped off, there is no avoiding standing in line and supervising the \"salad artist's\" every motion to ensure that you get the toppings you paid for. Or, upon getting the brown paper bag with your online order, you must open the bowl of salad and inspect it VERY carefully to check that everything you paid for is there. Also, don't forget to pick up utensils and napkins yourself, because the brown paper bag that they shove at you has none of that."}
{"text":"I stop by here once a year on my birthday month for my free salad because I can't really justify paying $10+ for a salad, no matter how much stuff I can put on it. Incase you didn't know, get on their e-mail list for a free meal on your birthday month! Their salad bar is pretty amazing with tons of toppings and choices to choose from. Meat costs an extra $2-$4, depending what you decide to add (bacon and ham does not count as meat, yay!). They'll even chop up your salad for you into bite size pieces so you won't look like a cow grazing through your greens."}
{"text":"I have been to Hello Bistro several times now and I really can't believe there aren't more places like this in Pittsburgh to build your own salad. I created my own salad with salmon as my protein. Seriously soooo many toppings to choose from. I had a hard time passing up any of them. I also ordered a kids meal for my daughter- grilled cheese, fries, milk and a smiley cookie for $5. Yes $5!!!! Seriously such a good deal.  We came in their off peak season since Pitt students were gone for the summer. With that said there was no wait to order and parking was easy. All a plus.  One thing I thought was strange was the fact that they have a family restroom but no high chairs. I get this is smack in the middle of college town but there were several other families there and you made a point to have a family restroom. There should be high chairs.  Food is good though so I will be back. I will just be better prepared with my daughter next time if we dine in."}
{"text":"\"I'm on a health kick\" so Hello Bistro has been my savior for the past few weeks. Their service is very efficient and often happy and inviting. You can't go wrong with the salads because you can call the shots, but some of their sandwiches are a little too oily considering they - in my experience - have been low on flavor.  I'm happy with their decision to stop selling alcohol, though the juxtaposition was cool, it was strange. 4 stars because I've started actually craving salads since going, so a big thank you!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. I got a burger and it was cooked perfectly. The bun tasted great, not sure if they season. I was really happy with the service and cleanliness as well."}
{"text":"So excited to have found this place Downtown! I've been looking for something that's open on the weekends for a great, fresh salad. Stopped in today for soup and grilled cheese - totally hit the spot!  Great place for an affordable, fresh, quick lunch."}
{"text":"I typically love this place -- nice salad bar with LOTS of options and the workers actually create the salad, so it seems cleaner than typical salad bars.  Sometimes it is great service and sometimes it isn't, so you should be prepared for that to go either way.  Don't forget a Smiley Cookie!  Hello Bistro is owned by Eat'n Park and have the same smiley cookies (smaller versions though)."}
{"text":"I love Hello Bistro & was so happy when they said they were putting one in McCandless Crossing. I went the day after it opened & was happy with my experience. I got a make your own salad ($7), avocado ($2 more) & shrimp ($2 more). Their salads are always delicious & I love the extensive options on the salad bar & the fact that they chop it small, medium or large according to customer preference. Their lime vinaigrette is to die for. The only light option is light French which I think they need to do better on. However, the salad was delicious as always. Next time I want to try a burger. I didn't like the one I had in the Southside, but want to try again. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"If you want to see a well-oiled machine at work during a busy lunch hour in downtown Pittsburgh, go to Hello Bistro. When I stopped in last week I watched about half a dozen workers on the salad bar alone, chopping away and making fresh salads for other customers. Not for me, however, as I opted for a single turkey burger that turned out to be very tasty. Juicy, covered with fresh veggies, and topped off with avocado sauce...talk about yum! And since the order didn't automatically come with a side of fries, as many burgers do, I was able to enjoy a fairly light lunch overall. Not easy to come by in downtown Pittsburgh.  That said, while I definitely recommend Hello Bistro for fresher and healthier grub, I don't recommend ordering anything other than salad during the lunch rush; it took a little longer to get my sandwich than a few of the other carry-out salad orders that arrived after me. I understand this, of course. It's a decent price to pay if it means that my food is being prepared as it's ordered, rather than in advance. And I didn't wait an insane amount of time at all. But it's still something to keep in mind if you're in a time crunch.  Good food, reasonable wait times, and staff that perform well under the pressure of a jam-packed eatery. Hello Bistro's a winner in my book. Go forth and dine healthily, diners. (Or don't: Hello Bistro's also known for making pretty tasty beef burgers!)"}
{"text":"I'll say it now, I really want to come back here; I've only been here once, and when I walked in the entire cozy restaurant smelled like a greasy, meaty heaven. Alas, I could not try one of their appetizing looking sandwiches or get a big pile of fries that particular day - not unless I wanted to be up and sick as a dog all night. So I had to go the healthy route, and ordered a salad instead.  Let it be known that Hello Bistro really must be good if I don't have any regrets or resentment since I more or less was required to eat salad for dinner - health reasons and whatnot always get in my way, it seems. But I was happy to find that their Mediterranean salad is a delicious and a great alternative to a greasy burger or whatnot. It was just a big bowl filled with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, and dressing, but the simplicity really didn't matter considering how fresh the greens were. It had the fresh taste and crisp crunch that you'd expect from a good salad. The portion sizing was a bit over the top, but these guys do have the sense to serve their giant salads in plastic bowls that just need a lid and are ready to go home with you. It's so simple, but I really like the fact that we didn't have to wait after eating to get another container and pack up my food. Really, my only complaint about my meal was that the salad had waaaay too many olives, but now I know better for future reference.  Keeping me from giving the place 5 stars is the simple fact that I really don't find this place super exceptional; it's a great cheap-eats spot that's pretty darn popular because it's cheap-eats. But the food isn't the best thing ever. It IS, however, better than what you'll find in a lot of other Oakland cheap-eat spots, which is probably why so many students pop in here so often.  On a final note, my friend definitely loved his sandwich as much as I enjoyed my salad, so next time, I'm planning ahead, not coming here after I eat too much in advance, and giving myself the chance to try some of what smelled so darn good when I walked in here!"}
{"text":"Terrible Service! Due to my short breaks at work I order my food online to spare myself waiting in a long line. EVERYTIME I go to pick up my food at the time it is supposed to be ready, it is never ready. My order is always messed up, I either have something missing or something I did not want added in (usually in my salad). If made correctly food is decent, but definitely not worth the hassle. I will not be going back :("}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday and this place was PACKED.  While the set up is kind of confusing, the staff will gladly help you along if you look bewildered (like I surely did).    I got the Crunchy Apple Almond salad.  It was OK.  I like the build your own salad concept, but thought that the ingredients in this salad just werent special.  The chicken was a little too similar to what you'd find on a salad at Wendy's.  Average salad, although next time I'll be sure to build my own and get wild.  Serves me right for playing it safe my first time.  I also got a cup of the Tomato Basil soup.  It was just OK as well.  Very tomatoey with almost no basil flavor.    So, a mediocre lunch place would be fine with me, although I felt that the items were overpriced.  My lunch came to over $12, without a drink.  If I'm spending that much I'll forgo the so-so ingredients of Hello Bistro and stick with Oishii Bento or Nellies."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time.  Meh.  The salad could have come from Subway and I would not have tasted the difference.  The staff was very friendly, and the dining room was clean.  The portions in the (Buffalo chicken) salad were adequate, but there wasn't a whole lot of chicken to be found.  Though I'm not sure, but I think I was supposed to get blue cheese crumbles in the salad.  They were too busy for me to approach anyone and ask.  My co-worker said that the fries were good, so there's that."}
{"text":"I was walking downtown on an anomaly of a beautiful winter night in Pittsburgh. I just got in from Los Angeles and I was looking for something light and healthy to eat. I was enjoying the process of walking around and looking at all of the options and variety in Market Square, when I happened upon Hello Bistro. From the outside I could already tell it had healthy options that I would be interested in. It also looked pretty busy on the inside so I always take that as a good sign. I waited in line for a little bit as there was a few people in front of me, that  gave me a chance to read through the menu and make my choice. I decided to build my own salad. Once I got to the register, it appeared that the cashier had something else to do so I waited at the register for a while. When she got back, she took my order and I paid. Yet, nobody ever made my salad. I waited for about 20 minutes and she apologized and said \"it was busy.\" I finally got my salad about a half hour later to go. I chose mixed greens and salmon with vegetables, crunchies, and a squeezed lemon and apple cider vinaigrette dressing. It was delicious but there was so much lettuce I could barely taste the good stuff. Maybe that's how some people prefer their salad, I would rather have a small bed of lettuce and a lot of veggies and meat. The next morning, I was craving a breakfast sandwich and I was working at Point Park University. Hello Bistro is right down the street, I went and got their California breakfast sandwich. I was the only one in there, they had just opened and the girl was just prepping the food. It's took me about 10 minutes in total. There's also a restroom there that you need the code for. The prices are very reasonable. I paid $13 for my salad because I had to pay extra for salmon and avocado, and my breakfast sandwich was only six dollars. I live in Los Angeles so these prices seemed extremely reasonable to me. They do have indoor seating, but most people were getting theirs to go. The breakfast sandwich was way better than the salad, however I still probably won't return, I would take it or leave it! It is an easy solution and quick fix if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout burger during rush hour, got home and had the wrong burger. Called them up and they couldn't have been nicer. Went back, the right order and two free cookies.  Food is very good and they treat their customers well.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here to pick up salads for lunch. We both go extra steak on our salads and a drink and we paid $30.00. HOLY CRAP, for two salads? UNREAL! And the worst part is the steak was nasty -- all fat and chewy. We both ended up throwing the salads away. What a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Great prices and a nice broad menu that's ideal for lunch or a light dinner.  Impressive salad options in a town where that's not always easy to find."}
{"text":"I have ordered a classic cobb, and it is a huge bowl for me. It tastes great and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Just dropped to 17 bucks on a burger and a salad with my wife. The cheapskate manager will not give us an extra plastic bowl that probably cost him all of a dime. There obviously hurting for money. I hope they don't go out. He's got to a sign  up that says hiring all positions. Maybe I should ask for one laying down!"}
{"text":"People say that if you don't have anything nice to say, then you shouldn't say it.  Personally, I don't have anything nice to say, so I wont say it."}
{"text":"I'm a huge salad fan, so this place was right up my ally. I got the Mediterranean and have to say that I was very pleased. I never order dressing with my salads (I don't like the overwhelming flavor and they're usually pretty high in calories), so I was very surprised when I tasted how flavorful this salad was without it. Most salads are usually bland and unpalatable on their own, and rely on a strong dressing to provide flavor, but not this one.  At the end of the day, it's just a salad, but one I would be happy to eat again. I can't vouch for any of the sandwiches or burgers here, but even if you think you're \"not a salad person\", there will definitely be something here for you to try out. At $7, the price is a wee steep, but that's to be expected from a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"So this is my first visit to hello Bistro. I gave one star because the Boylan bottling soda was excellent. But, that's all that was good. Tomato soup was watered down Campbell's.  I had the tandoori chicken arugula salad. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that there was possibly half an ounce of chicken. The arugula was not entirely  fresh, plenty of yellow wilted mixed . And probably 1/2 oz. of raw beets. $9 of wilted greens. If this is eat n park's version of healthy eating, they need to go back to the drawing board."}
{"text":"I always get food from Hello Bistro. I've been to the Oakland location and the Mccandless Location. The downtown location I always order online before picking up . I ordered for 12:30 . When you order online you go straight to the pick up window. My order was not ready. I waited 20 minutes for my food. There was no one at the register to acknowledge that I ordered to go. There was a guy running orders to the tables whom was very fast and efficient. If there busiest times are 12-2 they should not allow online orders during those times. Then finally 12:55 there are paper bags labeled with names . You have to flag someone down to let them know to place the order."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this spot during lunchtime but do not anymore because the service was horrible. Every time I went the same girl was on her phone while letting someone else do the work. She also would occasionally make a salad or touch something without washing her hands. I waited 25 minutes for a salad when there was only one person in front of me. I will not be going to this establishment again."}
{"text":"I love being able to customize my own salad.  Once you pick your toppings they chop it and toss it in dressing for you.  The salads are fantastic, but I also like their burgers and handcut fresh fries."}
{"text":"I tried Hello Bistro for the first time last week while on a business trip to South Side. Absolutely LOVED it! I have had two salads there, and the staff has been extremely nice, the salad and all of the vegetables were extremely fresh and crisp. Having them chop it up? Amazing!   Even the prices weren't bad, compared to other places where you may not get choices as fresh as the ones at Hello Bistro. Very comparable (even a little cheaper than some).   When I go back to the area, I will absolutely be visiting Hello Bistro again - I may even have to try the location on Forbes for dinner, too. :-)"}
{"text":"Okay, I will fess right now. I don't even LIKE salad much. I like vegetables a TON but throw em in a bowl together and hand it to me and I'll likely slap it back at you if you think i'll accept it as a meal of its own. I also dislike 80% of all salad dressing as well. Hello Bistro is great though, the Salads are large and their pre-set menus are fantastic. I always order the Chicken fiesta (mixed greens, Corn, tortilla strips, chicken, green and red peppers, red onion, avocado and blackbeans, i request no jalapenos tho) the dressing really makes it amazing and they mix up all the greens and dressing together so the flavors really permeate through the entire bowl. They're pretty ample with the toppings and you can request less/more of the basic stuff to suit you. I always have to take half of it home because of its large size.  I also had the burgers which are decent and the chili which is hearty and they offer boylan soda which is greatttt. I like the fries alot (even if shoestring is not my preferred) they're served in brown paper bags but i wish they'd have more large pieces because half my order is always the overfried tiny bits that just taste like salt. I've tried this location and downtown, Southside's is far superior in service and quality."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Oakland!  A variety of healthy (and not boring!) lunch options at student-friendly prices. They also have gluten-free options labeled on their menu, which made for no-hassle ordering (make sure to tell them you're ordering gluten free though, otherwise the salads come with a slice of bread on top).  For folks who are comparing it to Eat'n Park, that would be like comparing Chipotle with McDonald's.  Sure, same parent company, but completely different product and experience.... btw I am a huge fan of Eat'n Park too :)"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is one of my favorite go to places. Only bad thing is I somehow keep moving away from one that's close, right after it opens! Boo! But the trip is worth it.   The best way to describe this is a salad bar and a burger place had a baby. You can order pre-arranged salads and burgers off the menu, or you can create your own salad with whatever toppings you choose. Kinda of like a subway for salads. I always get the Buffalo chicken salad, no blue cheese and extra buffalo sauce, and it is hands down my favorite buffalo chicken salad! It's so fresh and I love that they mix the dressing and buffalo sauce right in the salad before they serve you.   They also have amazing fresh cut fries that I suggest to anyone! Only other item I've had here is a turkey burger with their pineapple salsa on top(forget the exact name,sorry!) everything is always good!   Only thing I don't like is how small the seating space is. This place gets PACKED! and it becomes kinda cut throat to get a table since it's is self seating. Basically have to stalk out where you wanna sit and wait for the people to clear. Other than that, I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I am so sad that I no longer live in Southside. Personally, I think they have the best buffalo chicken salad I have ever had, but that's just me.  I love the staff here! They are always welcoming and friendly. I feel like I am picky with what I want on my salad, and they have always understood that with a smile! The service is always quick and super fresh, and anything I have had here was good.   First time I tried Hello Bistro I got their Turkey Burger with mango salsa, and boy was that tasty!! No need for mustard or ketchup, which is shocking for me. Everything had so much flavor! I also ordered fries on the side which came in a brown paper bag - super neat. I love the fries also! They are thinner which I like and most places don't have that.  Now for the reason that I am totally in love with this place - their salads! They have salads you can pick from, create your own, or a mix of both. I always got the buffalo chicken salad. I customized it as I don't like blu cheese, but wanted to add this or that. It was never an issue! The salad comes with grilled chicken and the sauces/dressed is already mixed in with the greens once they bring the salad to you. Im sure you can ask for the dressing on the side, but I like that I didn't have to make a mess trying to mix in my dressing. Plus it is always perfect amount of buffalo sauce and dressing.   Honestly crave the salads from there and I wish there was a closer location to me! I can only hope they will expand and I can enjoy this deliciousness one again more conveniently!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it. One of the worst burgers I've ever had. Fries soggy and flavorless."}
{"text":"The amount of cheese in these sandwiches is incredible! They have a wide array of options, even for vegetarian peeps too."}
{"text":"Salads here are really delish!  I could eat them every day. This place is insanely packed during the lunch hours and extremely loud. It's is sometimes  hard to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"I got the veggie burger and it was delicious. Fries were greasy and mushy.. just how I like them :) table we sat at/next to wasn't cleared by the staff. It's one of those places where you leave it on the table and they tend to it. I'm definitely going back to find more goodies!"}
{"text":"Omgggg thank you Hello Bistro for your stellar salad bar and super friendly staff!! I was so excited to see the variety of veggies and how fresh everything was!!! I was overwhelmed with food joy when they asked me how i wanted my salad chopped!!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, good: I'd recommend this place for a quick meal that's nicer than fast-food.  Hello Bistro's forte appears to be the make-your-own salad option where numerous options for salad toppings are present.  The value is also tremendous: lots of food for your buck.  I myself enjoyed the veggie burger and a side of fries which was solid.  I don't really like how they deliver the fries in a brown bag to your seat at the restaurant-seemed aesthetically weird to me as the bag was coated with grease that soaked through, but whatever-the grease laden fries tasted great.  I could see how this place would be excellent for a quick lunch.  Check it out if you're in Oakland."}
{"text":"If you like salads, this is your place.  If you like grilled cheese, SO MUCH BETTER than the Yard.  Fresh, clean, simple."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro used to be out go to salad place in my office. We could older online and the pick up process was quick. Now, we don't go as much because they mess up the orders all the time. When they are right, they are really good though, but that's less than half the time."}
{"text":"What's better than made fresh.   Sandwich options too. Love peach Iced tea. Love chicken in my salad."}
{"text":"I stopped at Hello Bistro for lunch and was quite impressed.  The restaurant facilities are nice and exceptionally clean, even during the busy lunch hour.  The staff was friendly and efficient and the food was excellent.  I chose to order a salad and was very impressed with the freshness of the ingredients, selection and size.  When you order a salad you select from four different types of greens.  You can then choose from more varieties of vegetables, nuts, bacon, ham and cheese then you can imagine.  Of these, you can choose as many as you care to.  Additionally, for a small extra charge, you can choose to have a protein added.  All of this is packed into a quart size bowl.  One salad is really enough for two.  I highly recommend Hello Bistro.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Let me start with this - I love gigantic salads. They're delicious, healthy, and don't leave you with the sleepy food-coma feeling greasy foods do.  Hello Bistro is one of my go-tos for dinner. It's a little pricey at ~$10 with meat, but it's not a bad deal if you stack the toppings. Plus, you get to make it any way you want, which is always a plus. And the staff always obliges if you ask for a little extra of a few things.  Some friends have ordered the burgers and fries. They were so-so it seems. If you come here, I would definitely recommend the salad over everything else."}
{"text":"Great salads with tons of options. So glad to have you here in the south side!"}
{"text":"Who has two thumbs, wants a salad with every topping under the sun, likes'em big and has $9?  This girl.  Sometimes I miss my college days in Oakland.  Football games, skipping class, laying on the Cathedral lawn, eating at Hello Bistro...  NOT.  Had Hello Bistro opened in Oakland during my tenure there I most certainly would've stayed ANOTHER seven years in college.  It's SOOO delicious.  I ordered a make-your-own type of salad and bellied up to the salad bar to have one of Hello's salad artists create my concoction.  Starting with romaine I'm pretty sure I used at LEAST 40 of the 50 or so toppings available.  From three types of olives, wasabi peas and crisp granny smith apples, I was in some serious salad heaven.  Then, they took me and my monstrous salad to the chopping block where they chopped it up to my size specification: \"small bites, big bites, or somewhere in between?\"  Somewhere in between - oh yeah. Amazing.  I eat salads all the time. I have NEVER left a single shred of lettuce behind, yet this was one exception. The thing was just too big.  It probably didn't help that I noshed a bit on the delightfully-spiced French fries that accompanied my guest's Chunky Monkey Peanut Butter and *I want this in my face* Jelly sandwich.  Mmmm, mmm, mmm.  I can't wait to go back and try every last item on that mouth-watering menu.  And did I mention that they serve Boylan's soda, the greatest soda pop to ever grace the planet?!  HELLO!"}
{"text":"It's likely going to take me more time to write this review than I was actually at Hello Bistro.  Seems crazy that I'd give it 4 stars.  But I have my reasons.  First, the free birthday meal.  That's what got me here in the first place.  While it seems that most people (at least when I stopped in) order salads, I went with the Superburger Combo (burger, fries, drink).  I was impressed with the salad layout, but for my birthday if the choice is a burger or a salad?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'll always go for the burger.  Especially when it's an EnP classic.  While there were a few customers ahead of me, the wait wasn't long to place my order or receive it.  I ordered mine to go (online ordering is available, though I didn't go that route).  Service was what I expected (quick), so no complaints there.  When my order was handed to me, it was packaged like an old school diner might deliver it.  Burger was wrapped separately, hand-cut fries placed in a separate bag, all placed in a brown bag for transport.   Here's where Hello Bistro wins points: the dispenser of EnP ranch (complete with little cups and lids to go) and the Boylan soda fountain.  Two things I've never seen or expected but earned Hello Bistro high marks.  I didn't think the menu was all that exciting but now that I've seen what they have to offer, I'm fairly certain I'll be back."}
{"text":"It is definitely a good option for lunch if you are working in the area but do not expect something spectacular.  It is essentially a salad place mainly, with fresh ingredients. Of course most of the salad consists of whatever \"greens\" you pick :) Having said that the service is very helpful and quick.  Certainly, a place for a quick and potentially healthy grab."}
{"text":"My daughter has been here many times and knew I would love it.  If you love salads, this is the place to be!  It's amazing what you get for $7.  As you walk along the cafeteria line, the servers provide your choice of lettuces, then add as many toppings as you want ... great toppings ... not your standard run of the mill place.  I piled on 20 different toppings ... lots of artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, goat cheese, quinoa, lentils just to name a few.  And, interesting dressings.  I chose the lime citrus vinaigrette, yummy.  Also, includes a slice of bread if you ask for it.  The salad probably weighed 2 lbs and could have been eaten by 2 people!  And, coffee for only $1!  I will definitely be going back to Hello Bistro. They also offered table service with a nice decor and unique sandwiches, burgers, etc. but we took ours to go on the way to the pool."}
{"text":"Love this place. The salad and all the toppings are amazing. Such a fresh, light, and tasty lunch for a great price. Didn't order any protein."}
{"text":"Sort of a hipster style health food cafe similar to panera without the ridiculously overpriced pastries. Salads, burgers paninis etc.  Menu is fully customizable.  Boylan soda fountain.  Staff is polite and informative. Very clean and symmetrical dining area. I opted for the chicken fiesta salad."}
{"text":"I was incredibly underwhelmed by Hello Bistro.  My friend treated me out to dinner on a Friday night and suggested we eat at Hello Bistro which just so happens to be a favorite lunch spot of hers.   I got the whatever salad with shrimp.  I was expecting maybe shrimp laid prettily onto of a bed of fresh greens what I got was a plastic bowl full of what looked like a left overs and shrimp bits mixed into it.    I am not a fan of Hello Bistro.   I do appreicate that HB has beer for sale that's a nice Oakland/Collegetown touch."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro has been on my short list of places to try when traveling to Pittsburgh, for business.   I ventured there at around noon on a Thursday afternoon,  The place was packed.  Most tables where occupied and there was a line for food, but the line moved very quickly.  I approached the register, ordered the salad bar $7.95, add chicken for an additional $2 and quickly took my place in line to have an employee prepare my salad, to my liking.  I love the idea of a salad bar, where the employees prepare the food.  No germy customers touching the items.   The options are endless!   Lots of healthy options, starting with your choice of greens.  I chose the kale/spinach mix, but there was also spring greens and romaine to choose from.  I topped my salad with quinoa (yum!!), chickpeas and lots of other fresh veggies.  There were raw options and roasted options in addition there were 3 options for chicken, Tandoor, Fajita, or salt/pepper/garlic.  I opted for the latter.  My selection was then passed on to the next station where it was chopped, topped (I chose pepitas) and dressed.  I really enjoyed my salad, the portion and value was spot on.  I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get in here just before the lunch mob swarmed this place on a Monday.  I could not have timed that more perfectly!  I wasn't in a rush, but certainly wouldn't have wanted to wait in the line that extended out the door.  Granted that make your own salad option is choice.  The cashier explained to me what to do (since I'd only been to another location for Superburger combos) and I couldn't wait to tell them to add, well, almost everything.  A little of this, a little of that...and then with a medium chop and just a drizzle of the ranch dressing I couldn't even tell what all was in there.  And I loved every bite of it!  You start with lettuce (mixed greens, kale, romaine, spinach) and then they top it with any and all toppings at no additional charge.  Even though meats are extra, I splurged on the salmon for $3.  This was possibly the most amazing salad I've ever eaten for $11.  It can get crazy and messy in there, but they keep things loving at a pretty steady pace.  I was impressed with the way they kept it all organized with dine in and take out orders all coming in at the same time.  My only concern is that it could be cleaner with how fast they chop those salads."}
{"text":"Excellent salads, burgers and even better are their fries. Service is fast and efficient. The employees make you feel welcome.  Best of all is the  Boylan soda fountain, which is the main motivation to go as far as I'm concerned!  It's adjacent to the Pitt campus, lots of students eating here.  Overall, high marks on every level."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot on my way home Friday after work. I had just beat the evening rush hour although the place was packed, I quickly placed my order to go and was checked out before the family of 5 next to me.   I did a build-your-own-salad with so many veggies on top and salmon and avocado - my total was just under $13 and I easily could've eaten that salad for two meals.  I made it through the line quickly and was on my way in about 10 minutes.  It was soooo loud in there.  High ceilings and cement floors don't help..but it was packed - a good sign.  Glad they got their routine down pat and there wasn't nearly as much chaos as my first visit when they had just opened."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and easy to order. Food was ok, had the salad, nothing too special. The burger and fries were delicious though!! Trendy place, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a menu with lots of healthy and delicious choices. The salads looks great, but I opted for the veggie burger, which was pretty good. The store is connected to the juice bar next door, so it's convenient to slide over there for a juice."}
{"text":"Had the pot roast and pepper jack grilled sandwich. Awesome. Great pot roast flavor and lots of cheese. Side salad has lots of goodies, they didn't skimp on any ingredients. Just wish the seating was more comfortable and not so much like a cafeteria."}
{"text":"I have never been to Hello Bistro before, but had heard good things about the burgers and salads. We ended up trying the place on a Saturday night, as our other plans for dinner were going to be over an hour wait. So we skipped the wait times at the other restaurants at McCandless Crossing and found ourselves here.   They were somewhat busy for 8pm on a weekend evening- nothing extreme. But it seemed like the \"to go\" orders were the ones that were taking the most time. There were a lot of people sitting around in the dining area who were waiting with slips for their to-go orders. The line moved fairly quickly - but the girl who was working the register was rude and just so painfully adolescent. She was annoyed by us ordering our meals because one of her friends was in the line behind us. She was smiling and waving around us, trying to not be agitated by having to take our order to talk to her friend. She was not paying attention because of this and we had to tell her three times that we needed two cups for two separate drinks. Ok, a little annoying, but I can get over it. She was huffy and rolling her eyes even though we probably had a 5 minute interaction with her.   We waited about 15-20 minutes for our orders to be ready for dining in. We went to find a table - which was a chore as every single table was DISGUSTING. They were covered in sticky soda, dried ketchup and trays of other people's garbage from their meals was just sitting around all over the place. It was really gross. Fiance ended up cleaning our table AND the drink/straws/ketchup stand because it was so foul.   When our food finally arrived the teenage boy who gave it to us said what my order was, then gave it to me. He then said \"and this other thing\" when handing fiance his meal. Uhm ok. Again, I can get over it and will try not to hold the service overall to these teenagers who were running the place on this night. This teenage boy also was in charge of cleaning the tables and drink station - which he walked by the garbage, spills and dirty tables repeatedly. When we left the place he still had not come out to wipe anything down or throw anything away.   I went for the \"over easy\" burger and fiance had the pot roast sandwich. Both were actualy pretty good. My burger was actually really well seasoned, tasted good, and was hot; though it was a pre-made patty, not a handmade one.  The homemade ranch they offer at the condiment stand was also AMAZING. If we could have dipped our hands into it, we would have. We also got orders of their fresh cut fries, which were good - but would have been 1000X better if they would not have been cold.   Overall, not a bad enough experience to deter me from here, but I think I would like to try it on a weekday to see if there is a difference in service."}
{"text":"I like the speed of this fast casual place, but I inquired on the dressing ingredients... combo of vegetable, soy and canola oil, gross!  Maybe bring your own dressing"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and loved the concept.  Great service, fresh ingredients - a welcome entry into the healthy lunchtime market.  Only suggestion is to consider having a spinach only option (currently only has a spinach/kale mixture).  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this little place? I used to frequent the Oakland location when I worked at UPMC Presbyterian, so when they opened a spot just a half block from my apartment, I was thrilled!  Hello Bistro is owned by the Eat 'N Park group, so you'll find similar menu items here - including the delicious, world famous (well, at least in my opinion) SuperBurger.    If you're in the mood for something a little healthier, their salad combinations are endless!  One trick I've learned is to ask them to chop up the lettuce before adding any toppings.  Since most of the toppings are already diced, they tend to get mushed during the chopping phase - asking them to do that step first creates the perfect salad! There is an additional, nominal upcharge to add protein to your salad, but aside from that, you can add as many toppings as your hungry heart desires!  You can easily get out of there for $10 per person, including a beverage.  They even offer classic fountain sodas, which is a nice touch!  The Southside location has a giant front window that they open in the warmer months for some al fresco dining, so if you can, grab a seat in front of the window for some glorious people watching ;)"}
{"text":"Definitely call ahead for take-out orders off of the menu.  This place is a madhouse, even before noon after all of the students have left for the summer.   They were out of the dressing I wanted, but a manager came out and adjusted my order and gave me a free chili for my trouble.  The power protein salad is totally my style.  It goes well with the pesto dressing, although I bet I would have liked the lemon yogurt dressing better. The special sodas are a nice touch, but they are a little overpowering for someone who doesn't normally drink pop. It'll calm down once the ice melts a little."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but they make it so hard to do.  Orders are always wrong and even when ordering ahead at lunchtime there's still a long wait to get your food.  Great concept, good food, crappy service."}
{"text":"I visited hello bistro for the second time recently and was in love! I decided to make my own salad- kale, romaine, cucumbers, QUINOA, grilled corn, roasted broccoli, edamame, avocado, almonds... I literally put everything in This salad!   The customer service was great- the lady was patient as I ordered almost everything for this salad. They even ask you how you want it chopped and how much dressing you want- which is awesome!   I had this salad for lunch and was stuffed. I'm not the type of person that is ever really stuff after a salad but I totally was this time.. And I now copied off of them and add cooked quinoa in my salads at home now:).   What a refreshing place- huge portions, decent prices and awesome food- I am excited to return again soon when I'm in Oakland!"}
{"text":"I was dying for something reasonably priced and a bit unusual, so we headed to Hello Bistro in the frigid, blowing snow expecting to be the only people in there.  But no!  The place was packed and growing more so each moment even despite the blowing snow covering the ground.  If that's not a good sign for a new place, I don't know what it.   Due to the weather, I didn't feel like a salad, so I opted for the grilled cheese and tomato soup - upgraded to an apple, bacon and cheddar grilled cheese.  Just what the doctor ordered on a frigid day.  The apples were crisp and sweet and complimented the nice mound of cheddar.  The bacon was crispy and not greasy.  The tomato soup left a little to be desired.  I think they could have put a little more effort into it - it was a bit like canned tomato soup, but it still did the trick.  I love the Boylan fountain drinks as well.   I will be back to sample probably a burger and see what tasty deliciousness is contained in their version."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to Beachwood. The choices are amazing for your salads. I got the salmon added to mine and it was pretty tasty. I thought it may not be that great since it wasn't a seafood restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised. The bubbly is nice refreshing sparkling water  for people who don't drink soda. I posted a pic of my meal. Love this place"}
{"text":"My salad was good but had a bad encounter with one of the employees. I ordered one of their suggested salads and it was supposed to come with avocado but they were out of it. I asked to substitute cheese and red onion and the girl told me she would have to charge extra for one of the toppings. I understand they have rules but we all know avocado is one of the more expensive toppings so I felt that was an even sub. That employee had major attitude with me and the other one was rolling her eyes. Spoke with manager and he had no problem topping the salad with those 2 ingredients free of charge. The other employees were just being difficult."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch time locations in Oakland. I'm a pretty picky eater so a make your own salad option where you see each ingredients is a dream come true. I'm a vegetarian and their tofu is actually really good. It's nice and firm and the seasoning is savory. at Hello Bistro I get to put pasta on my salad and say \"all the cheese except blue\" and get rewarded with 5 different types of cheese on my salad! I'm also a big fan of their balsamic dressing which is nice and creamy and tart.   The downside: NEVER GO AT NOON. It gets crazy busy. I usually have to budget about 30 minutes just to stand in line."}
{"text":"This place is really grown on me since they opened up their downtown location. Generally speaking, I've liked most of the things that Eton Park does but I like this one most of all. Their burgers are top notch! I love getting a bacon and cheese burger with their awesome eat N park ranch dressing. Definitely strong competition for best burger downtown. Their fries are awesome too. The service is really good and even if it's a long line moves pretty quickly. It's a great in and out joint for a quick burger."}
{"text":"I'm still shaking my head....  So we head down to the Southside last Wednesday (12/28) for a late lunch around 3pm.  We go in and I see that the folks behind the counter see us, but decide to just keep talking to each other with their backs turned.  Finally the young man turns around and I say \"hello\" - nothing....so I begin my order - \"two alarm turkey burger please\", he replies before I can finish \"no, that's seasonal only\", I guess I looked stunned as he repeated \"seasonal\", so I ask \"what part is seasonal, the turkey burger or the jalapeños?\" again he says \"seasonal\" so I ask \"can I get a turkey burger with jalapeños\" he just stares at me and say \"seasonal only\".  Seriously!  So i just say \"thanks for all of your help, I think we will take a pass on eating here today\".  He turns around and resumes his chat with his co-worker which I so rudely interrupted.  Wow."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced. I had the salmon soba salad which was way over dressed. Def suggest getting dressing on the side! Only a few scant soba noodles and mushed up tiny pieces of salmon. I don't get the hype and why it was so crowded mid day - perhaps because one believes any type of salad is \"healthy\"?"}
{"text":"Last week I went into hello bistro for dinner 3 times to have soup all 3 times they did not have any soup left today ( a new week) I went in and asked for chicken noodle soup the only soup they had left was potato knowing the weather is cold wouldn't you think you would be stocked on soup?"}
{"text":"I wanted to call this chain the GOODBYE BISTRO because every time I went to the other locations they were closed early.  Anyway, this is a clean, modern diner where you can build your own expensive salad from a million ingredients or get burgers, grilled cheese or soup.  I got the onion mushroom burger with fries. The burger was ok and my fries were over cooked and over salted and burnt. It was just ok.  If you want to sit in a clean diner in a nice European styled plaza with rich white people listening to retro and Christian rock hits while eating salad then this is your place."}
{"text":"I like this cafe it's a cool place to eat. They have a giant make your own salad for 7 to 9 bucks. I already had salad at home so I tried the grilled cheese with apples and bacon. It was just ok, not that flavorful. The fries are ok."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and healthy, but staff can be very rude. There is not a good place to stand when waiting for your order but the solution to that is not to almost yell at customers. Without saying anything to me, another staff member also took my number out of my hand--I couldn't tell what she was doing and eventually she placed it on the counter next to me, still without ever saying a word to me even after i asked what was going on. Strange and rude. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian candy land. It is basically like a Chipotle for salads. The ingredients are very fresh and the staff here are great. The staff works very hard especially with the high amount of foot traffic and are always super nice even though it is always slammed during the lunch break when I go. Definitely recommend for a fast healthy lunch.  If you want to get a little unhealthy though, the fries are incredible."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that makes the misery of finding parking near Forbes Avenue in Oakland worthwhile. It is like the Subway of salads. You go in and you can pick from 6 types of greens (I opt for kale and spinach) they offer proteins which includes tofu for vegetarians like myself and anything else you could imagine for salad toppings. They mix it all up as much as you want and add dressing for a huge meal that will keep you full and not feel like an unhealthy jerk when you're done. Also, other side note items, the fries are pretty outstanding and also the soda fountain is like \"boutique\" real sugar soda from some independent brand. Highly recommend for a fast meal in Oakland."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that I LIVE for build your own salads. So I had nothing but pure delight when I heard about this place and their salad options!   I finally made my first visit last night and I was as happy as a clam! Yes, the salad bar is slight disorganized, but the yumminess of the salad but up for any confusion I had in the salad line! The apple cider vinaigrette is my new favorite dressing. :)   One of the people I was with got the American Grill Burger ( an Eat n Park favorite of mine) and it looked extra good!   I personally can't wait to go back and take other people!! :)"}
{"text":"I've only had the salads at Hello Bistro and have been underwhelmed every time. The salad I had yesterday (4/16/18) was absolutely horrible. It truly seemed like a 4 day old salad. Rotting lettuce. Tasteless beets. Other vegetables so old they were wet and made the whole thing a bit soppy. I never take the time to write reviews but I had to call Hello Bistro out on this particular salad. Maybe something was going on there that day, but they are always super busy and you'd think the turnover of ingredients would keep them fresh, but they are far from it. I hate to have to write this because Eat 'n Park is near and dear to my heart. I worked at store #1 when I was a teenager."}
{"text":"Was looking for a reasonably priced place to eat with the boyfriend on a Friday night. Decided to go here. It was a good choice!  I had the cheddar, bacon, and green apple grilled cheese. It was different, but I thought it was good. I also had a side of fries, which were also very good. They have a different selection of fountain sodas, including cream soda, orange, red birch beer, lemonade, and some others. I had the cream soda, and it was good as well. My boyfriend had the burger with egg and bacon on top. I had a bite of that and found it to be very good as well.   If I returned I would consider getting a salad. They appeared to have a ton of options for toppings!   Overall, I recommend Hello Bistro to others and will probably be returning in the future."}
{"text":"My very first Hello Bistro experience was right in my own backyard! So excited to welcome Hello Bistro to the North HIlls in McCandless Crossing! I've been here twice already and am so impressed. It is everything a true Pittsburgher loves about the Eat n Park salad bar, except more delicious options! They also serve burgers and grilled cheese, which I'm dying to try on another visit. They have several salad options you can select and have made for you or you can go custom and walk through the bar and select your toppings yourself. I haven't done the latter yet, but my husband has and has been very satisfied with it. The portions are HUGE. You get an extra deep bowl of all your salad fixings perfectly chopped and mixed together to ensure you don't get that end of the salad blues where all you have left is lettuce because you've eaten everything else off the top. They also serve french fries that are SO GOOD. They come in a bag and are more than enough to share."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place such a low review because the food is great but the service is horrible. Every time I come I feel like I'm ruining their day being there. I keep coming back because of the great salads but they need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting Hello Bistro for the fresh salads with great toppings. At a usual busy time of 5:30 it was dead. When we walked up the the counter we were rudely approached by the girl behind the counter and she just stared at us and the girl behind her. The girl who made my salad was even worse and I felt like I was bothering them me being there. Great food but poor service."}
{"text":"I came here a long time ago when they first opened and got a veggie burger. I asked them to cook it very well, almost overcooking it. But when I got it home to eat, it was an undercooked mush burger on a bun. It was absolutely terrible and got thrown away.  Thus, I got turned off from the whole place.  However, yesterday I met a friend for salads. My first thoughts were that it's ridiculously loud inside and the line for ordering gets really long, requiring anyone who wants to use the restroom to battle through those trying to order.  It seems like a poor set-up to me.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my salad. There are endless options and the salads are huge, making them very well worth their cost. In fact, I came again this afternoon for another salad. While there seems to be a little inconsistency with chop size and topping amounts, this can all be dealt with individually.  I will definitely be back for salads in the future, but would pass on the other items.  4/21 Update:  I've bumped my review down. I went today for my salad, which I haven't had in about a month. I immediately noticed the bowls were a good bit smaller than previously, but the price was every bit the same.  They pack the bowls so high with lettuce that any toppings I requested were falling off.  Last, they no longer allow me to get my cheese after the chopping. I like my cheese in larger chunk form so I can taste it, not obliterated in the small chop.  I don't really have a reason to go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Hello Bistro a couple times - this is the first I enjoy my food.  It is slightly overpriced for the quality of food.  It is however in a convenient location close to work.  If you want to go over lunch time - you best be there slightly before 12 when the line extends out the door.  It would also be appropriate to have a cashier that is well versed at using the register at this busy time!"}
{"text":"From the outside looking in, this place does not give you a \"burger joint aura\" if you know what I mean, but I was definitely surprised. The fries are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I ordered online for the Oakland location and waited more than 25 minutes after the scheduled pick up time because it was during a lunch rush, but my ordered never came out. I asked for help, but had to wait another 5 minutes before an employee could check on my order. I was told they could still make my salad, but it would take another 5 minutes. My lunch hour was over at this point and I had to ask for a refund. It was frustrating."}
{"text":"I came here expecting it to be amazing but it was sub-par. The burger was good but I wish the bread was warmed, and they put shredded lettuce instead of a slice. Also, I was really excited for the fries, expecting them to be crispy, but they were kind of tasteless and wet. The atmosphere is great and the service is nice, but the food could have been so much better. This is a great addition to beachwood."}
{"text":"Great salads.....plenty of options to choose from. Make your own salad is the best option I feel. you can add upto 20-30 items and excellent dressing choices... This place has a long queue everyday during lunch time so to save some time try to come before 12p.m!! The salads are a little on the expensive side, not possible for a student to eat here frequently but the salad portion is good. Chili lime and chipotle BBQ are my favorite dressings.."}
{"text":"This place fukin sux bruh. I gave it tons of chances like I got a salad and it was sh*t but I went again and got the caprese grilled cheese and the mf was SOGGY ???? 0/10 would not recommend. They really got bad service too and it takes forever to get the food it's unbelievable. Overpriced and overrated don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Wow, SO MUCH LETTUCE in their salads! I went here for the first time and picked up a fiesta salad. It was enormous, buuuut was about 95% romaine lettuce. It wasn't a salad with super extravagant/expensive ingredients, but I felt like I encountered about 10 black beans in the whole salad. Surprisingly, I did get a few good bites of avocado- so why skimp on cheaper ingredients like beans and corn? I would gladly take a smaller salad if it had a better ratio of lettuce to the good stuff.   This place also gets crazy crowded at lunchtime, but I will say they seemed pretty efficient for the volume of customers they had."}
{"text":"Lunch can be very busy.   Great salads - I like chopped fine.   Definitely try the burgers here too.   You can order ahead and they will have ready to go on a pickup shelf."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is my go-to downtown lunch spot. I love the make-your-own salad - it's fresh, lite, delicious, and different every time. The staff is courteous - even during the relentless lunch rush.  Slow service is an issue. Today it took 20 minutes to make, chop, and serve my salad. Hello Bistro has a great concept, fresh food, and a very interested lunchtime audience. I'd like to see them up their game on execution. Tip: be sure to order at the register before joining the salad line."}
{"text":"The staff is exceptional!  That's where my positive review ends. The food is just, well, meh. Unremarkable burger, which was disappointing. The potato soup is pretty good."}
{"text":"Eat-n-park has the south hills locked down! With their flag ship stores and now the addition of the Porch and Hello Bistro, you can't miss!And in a good way! What a great concept! Fresh food at great prices, in a laid back fun setting. The sandwiches and burgers are great! Made fresh to order. The hand cut fries are incredible and for 2$ you get a sack of them!! The salad set up is amazing! Made to order then you pick the fix-ins and they mix it, chop it, and serve it up! Great drinks in the fountain by Bolen and the milkshakes are amazing also. They setting is fun a open with tables and high seating. Plus an outdoor section, which pittsburgh restaurants need to get on Board with more! People like to sit outside to eat. Period!  The prices can't be beat either, for lunch for two with drinks to be under 20$, you have to love that!"}
{"text":"The service here is comparable to a turtle race.  I have been here on several occasions, with much time in between my visits, in hopes that there was turn over in employment and they hired some folks with a little pep in their step.  A salad, created from a salad bar in essence, should never take 25 minutes to create. Especially when you are the only person in line. This place needs run a little better but even then I don't know if that would help with the taste of their food. I have ordered multiple salad concoctions and have found they all taste the same. There's a weird spiciness to all of their dressings, blue cheese included, which over powers the other ingredients.  Also note this place is hardly clean even when it's the least busiest and the children working have plenty of time to be chit chatting but not wiping down tables, refilling plastic wear or emptying trash bins."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great salad in Pittsburgh, this is the place to come.  The store is new so it is very clean.  The concept is very similar to Chipotle or Chopd.  They have special salads or you can build your own.  The line moves fast and you will have a hearty salad in a matter of minutes.  The salads are HUGE.  I could not even finish mine.  They also have burgers, soup and other goodies.  Great lunch or quick dinner spot."}
{"text":"We were out walking this morning and stumbled onto hello bistro and the delicious raw juice bar. I wish we would have found this place the night before. If you love making \"big\" salads but hate buying all of the stuff to make them this is the place for you. $7.95 base with no meat and $2-3 for chciken or shrimp! We went to meat and potatoes the night before and paid $56 for two tiny salads and a piece of chicken....some complaints have been made about the ratio of lettuce to toppings. If you make your own salad there is no problem with toppings. They don't weigh  any of the ingredients so pile it on! Supposedly the burgers are really good to but we didn't try them yet. We did go around 9:45 and we had the place to ourselves. I would imagine around lunch it is very busy. It's worth a try once if you like salads!"}
{"text":"We live up in Erie and are glad a hello bistro opened slightly closer to use. We love this place. So many choices and they are very quick. My only negative about this location was the cleanliness. It was very dirty on the floor and the tables. The salad and burger were very good as usual."}
{"text":"Good selection of salad options as well as ability to create/make own.  Quality is what you pay for and perfect for a quick lunch.  Problem is they have difficulty handling the lunch rush - so if you only have a half hour, get here as close to 12 as possible."}
{"text":"Extremely bland and watery. I decided to try it here again after a bad experience at a different location. I ordered my own salad with tandoori chicken. I ordered: Romain lettuce, ramen, bacon, eggs, chick peas, ham, pineapple, peanuts, croutons, cranberries, cheddar cheese, chow mein noodles, and ranch. Surprisingly, the only things I could taste was the peanuts, cranberries, and pineapple. Other than that, there was no flavor even with the ranch dressing. The staff was friendly and helpful but the kitchen area seemed a mess."}
{"text":"I didn't have very high expectations when I decided to try this place, but I'm glad that I did. The food here is great, whether it's a burger, salad, or their amazing French fries. With the variety of toppings/additions to choose from, there's something here for even the pickiest of eaters. It does get fairly busy, so the quality of service isn't the best, but it's not bad enough that I wouldn't come back. I just wish they'd pay more attention to the takeout counter rather than constantly standing with their backs to it. All in all though, it's reasonably priced and very convenient to stop at for a lunch break.   My ONLY real complaint with the place is the ranch dispenser. For the love of god, Hello Bistro, either refill or replace the dispenser! Every time I've come in the handle has been all wonky and you have to try extremely hard to get ranch to come out. It feels empty, but there's also definitely something wrong with the pump. I've gotten ranch in my hair and on my clothing on multiple occasions while trying to get some out--yuck! It doesn't look very nice either.   Fix the dispenser and everything will be good in my eyes."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to visit Hello Bistro today! I love the concept of it, but ehhhhh idk how quick I want to return. HB is clearly very popular, as it was packed when I walked in at about 12:10pm. My friend ordered a tandoor salad and was told it would be a half an hour to make. Whoa! I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and an iced tea, for a little over $11. The wait wasn't too bad considering how busy the place was. My salad was pretty good (I do wish it had more veggies in it) but I can't get on board with that price! The line for the online orders was insanity. I see someone else reviewed today and said it was 40 min long, I might believe that. I will consider returning in the future but will make sure to go early or in between lunch hours!"}
{"text":"Suuuuuuper pissed off that Hello Bistro downsized their salad bowls by like.. HALF. Guy tried to tell me their taller and not as wide now. LOL okay, no. Definitely not worth $8.29 anymore.    So uncool."}
{"text":"Just tried Hello Bistro for the first time, and it was amazing!! I love salad, and I get them basically every restaurant I go to. Build your own salad is the best concept in life, and they have a plethora of salad toppings and dressings. Most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I write this review with conflicted opinions...after a weekend of binge drinking and eating late night pizza, i enter the work week craving kale and mixed greens. Hello Bistro gives you the opportunity to order a pre-made salad, or create custom salads with a wide variety of veggies, fruits, crunchies and dressings available. Being that it is owned by Eat N' Park, the Super Burger is highly recommended as well. If you're into pop, the Boylan soda is LEGIT.   Having said that, if you want to get a salad during the hours of 11:30-1:30, which is the time 99% of us take our lunch breaks, be prepared to wait in line to order...and then wait in ANOTHER line to be served. I realize that it's a stressful job for some of the people that work there given the amount of people that come in on a daily basis, but I had to explain to the worker yesterday what jalapenos and cheddar cheese were. As you can imagine, this kind of service is why the lines are SO long.   There is the option of ordering online for pickup, but I like to see my salad being made in front of me and it tends to be bigger and better! Hello Bistro is definitely a very delicious, healthy and great place for lunch. I just wish there was more organization when I go there for lunch."}
{"text":"Fries are like a black peppered peel on version of in N out!  Boylans soda! Birch beer! Yeah!  Emp burger however was good but flat. Their secret sauce was mayo and coupled with the pickles it tasted like a Big Mac. I didn't go to McDonald's. I don't want a better quality Big Mac. I'll try the bbq or avocado next time.    So the only area I would say it drops is the staff. Sadly it's very lacking. I don't know why they are all unhappy to be there.   Management, you need to make your staff happy so the customers get better treatment."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was great. I love the way they make their salads. I probably should have had one of those - they look so delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here for the soups. They are excellent. It's also a place where you can get amazing salads. The service seems to be a bit slow, but if you're not in a hurry it's not a big deal. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I should've known by the stupid name... This place sucks. McDonald's quality food served on a metal prison tray.   Americans are willing to pay for and eat crap as evidenced by all of the Hello Bistros popping up around Pittsburgh.    I explained to the counter girl who was too busy to greet us when we walked in the door that we had never been there before and I asked her how things worked. Looking around I could tell this was another do it yourself, assembly line à la Chipotle type restaurant. The enthusiasm that she displayed in her explanation made me feel like she was more concerned about getting back to her cigarette that she left burning on the ledge outside the back door than she was about my dining experience.   Stand up Americans. You deserve better. Don't eat here, don't accept this kind of mediocrity. It's not like your electing the next president, this is important."}
{"text":"I like Hello Bistro, don't get me wrong.  That said, it's just this location that I've come to despise.  Working nearby, I was so excited for this place to open awhile back.  After months of disappointment, I will no longer be coming here.  I cannot say that I haven't given this place more than enough chances... I definitely have.  My experiences in Southside and Oakland have been better, but this location, well, my experiences have sucked.  Whether I place the order online with ample notice of pickup , or order when I'm the sole customer there in the morning, my order has been wrong (more than a handful of times to say the least).  I was naive to think eventually things would improve and I kept giving them chance after chance.     The worst part of it is the unapologetic attitude that I received from a manager this morning upon returning to my desk with what was not my order.  I ordered a skinny scrambler without cheese and was given what I'm calling a filthy scrambler with cheese (and bacon).  If that's what I wanted, I would have ordered it. When I called, she said \"we knew that but you already left\"... And then just robotically took my info and said they may send me a gift card.  I even said there was no way I was coming back there, and she didn't even try to sound empathetic to my frustration.  I know that I may sound like I'm going a bit overboard, but this was like the 9th time that this has happened and I was very hangry...   If I get my gift card that \"may\" be sent, it will get used in Southside or Oakland where the Hello Bistro staff gets orders right and provides good customer service. If you can choose which one to go to, pick one of these as downtown is just lacking in terms of service and accuracy of order."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. It was super chaotic at lunch time but all the workers were friendly. Props to anyone who works there too because it looks intense. I'm giving four stars because it took forever for my salad to come out and I thought they gave my salad to someone else. Anyway the food was delicious! I got the Sesame salmon soba salad and it was delicious! My father made his own and the citrus chipotle dressing he got was phenomenal! Definitely give this place a try! Oh but there is no free water like at Panera."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro ended up being pretty much what I expected it to be.  It is pretty much a classier version of Eat'n Park.  Overall it was a nice place to get a good, cheap lunch.    The inside has a nice modern look to it.  The service during our visit was average.  The workers we encountered could have been more helpful for it being our first time.  For my meal I went with the Superburger and fries.  The burger was exactly the same as Eat'n Park, which is what I expected.  As usual, it was very good.  The French fries are really good and very different from Eat'n Park's.  They are skinnier and have a really good seasoning on them.  Another plus of this place was the self dispensing Eat'n Park ranch dressing.  Can't beat that.  I would like to go back to try the salads which looked really good.  Overall it was a pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"What is up with this location? The place is filthy. The servers are less than helpful. The food took forever. The restroom was a mess. Awful experience, considering how fortunate they are to have this location."}
{"text":"I've been to this downtown location a few times and it's a great place to grab a quick lunch. They have a variety of burgers if you're feeling indulgent or many different salad options if you are feeling like being a little healthier. I really like the option of ordering ahead online to pick-up in store. It's great to avoid wasting too much of your lunch break waiting in line! This place does get VERY busy around noon, so I'd try to get there early or wait until after the rush if you don't have much time.  They have suggested salad combos or the option to make your own salad. I was very impressed with the options for lettuce, veggies, toppings and dressings. They do have a little something for everyone! The salads are pretty big, I wish they offered a smaller size because I am never able to finish it!  Their burgers are good too. I'd say it's a step up from a fast food burger, but not quite gourmet. I wish you could have the option to pick how you would like your burger cooked, but I also understand it would be difficult with this kind of set-up. They also have fresh-cut fries that are delicious.   Being the glutton that I am, one of my favorite things about this place is that they not only have a ketchup dispenser for fries, but they also have one for RANCH! I also love that they have Boylan's Ginger Ale!  If you're looking for a nice lunch option that you can keep under/around $10, this is a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"This place is super good! I got the BBQ chicken salad twice now and it's fresh and delicious. Generous size helping. Price is good as well. I also tried the chicken soup and it was good as well! Close to the hospital which is a plus!  I recommend trying here !"}
{"text":"This place is super ok.  I had a burger and it was fresh.  I think that 5 guys is a little more tastey.  The fries were excellent.  And I liked the choice of ketchup and ranch for dipping.  The salads looked really good...next time I will go for one."}
{"text":"I feel like I should write a review since I've been here 4-5 times since it opened a month ago hehe.   I've always been a fan of Hello Bistro since first going to the Oakland location when I lived there. Bobby fell in love with their salads and i dig the super burger and fries (& salads, but i'm more of a french fry person lol) I actually remember writing in my review for the Oakland location \"it'd be awesome if they put a HB downtown\". It's like I have a magic genie or something :O  The reason I waited a little for the review is because the first 2 weeks the wait time was a little long due to just opening and everyone checking it out. I didnt want to put in review that I waited forever for my food because I knew eventually it would be fine. But now even when it's busy, the wait time to get your food is not long at all.. so that's a plus.  They have specials here that I dont remember seeing at the other locations (forgive me if i'm wrong on that fact) You can get a grilled cheese, soup & drink for $6.99 or a super burger, fries & drink for $7.99. The grilled cheese was tasty and i've had it both with their tomato and chicken noodle soup. I felt the chicken noodle soup was really lacking chicken but eh what can ya do. The grilled cheese was fine and it helped my tummy a week after being sick and my appetite not getting back to normal asap.   I havent had a salad from this location, but every other location I experienced a great salad.  I'm so thankful and excited this is downtown since I spend 40+ hours a week here. I love the build your own salad idea and they have a lengthy list of choices to put on your salad. Check it out if you've never experienced Hello Bistro!"}
{"text":"I've lived in south side over a year, but my first visit to the Southside HB wasnt until recently.  The reason is that when the entire business was brand new in oakland, we ate there like 4 times a month.. after church, after work.. whatever.. Not to mention lunch at the downtown location .  My friend stopped in to see me and heard great things about HB. I wanted to show her the cultural shops in southside so we decided to stick there for lunch  Anyone who is new to HB.. its a giant salad bar. They have a menu with salads already thought up by HB (Salads by Us). They also have tons of toppings and you can make up your own salad (Salads by You) HB also has a menu full of sandwiches & burgers (EnP Super Burger is delish). Their fries are fresh cut and they have a freaking ranch dispenser with EnP ranch. They also sell Boylan soda and omg the ginger ale is amazing.  My friend and I both ordered the Apple Almond Crunch.. romaine, grilled chicken, granny smith apples, blue cheese, almonds served with an apple cider vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. I subbed mixed greens for the romaine and mozzarella for blue cheese since im not a fan of that. The dressing was delicious and the salad was light yet so sooo filling.  We also ordered fries and EnP ranch to share. Yaas"}
{"text":"We decided on Hello Bistro one day last weekend. I had been putting off going here because I never really found myself in the mood for a salad. Yes, i thought the only thing Hello Bistro had was a giant salad bar.  Both of us decided on a burger and fries. Decent burger and pretty sweet options to choose from, especially the breakfast sandwiches (which are served all day). I really enjoy the fresh cut fries.. and at $2 it cant really be beat. That's pretty much the price of a half-full bag of funyuns, haha.   Kudos to HB for having a ranch dispenser from the girl who eats ranch. with. everything. ! The Boylan Soda fountain was a nice touch too!  Next time, I'm going to try the salad. I couldnt make up my mind this past Sunday and didn't want to hold up my party, which is why I decided on the burger. I think its pretty sweet that HB has a salad bar + a menu with that has cool salad ideas already created! (salads by us) there are some pretty interesting options there.. Same is true for the regular salad bar (salads by you)   By the way, remember at the beginning of this review i stated \"i never really found myself in the mood for a salad\"... wellllllll, since heading here, i've been patiently waiting to head back for a salad...... & I brought home their menu, so I often find myself staring at the fridge at the HB salad menu! aah  We shall return and i'll update my salad experience.  I wonder if a HB will ever have a location downtown. That'd be pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Was out with my children to grab a bite to eat the staff was walking around aimlessly whenever they took time out of walking around to take my order it was like I was bothering them I wouldn't mind but the food was over cooked thanks for the great night out"}
{"text":"Salad concept is great but place always seems dirty-- not just from the messiness that comes after a busy rush, but more of an accumulation of lack of cleaning. The counters and floors are covered with various types of food and cluttered, and the condiment dispensers are grimy. I understand the situational disarray after a lunch rush, but I work downtown and every time I've been here it leaves the same unhygienic impression. Hopefully they do some deep cleaning and maintain this after they expand."}
{"text":"It s a burger with mushrooms jack cheese & sautéed purple onions &  simple as it was, it s really good with some tasty fries& Boylan's- all good!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Sunday. The staff was friendly. I ordered an avocado burger and fries. The burger had melted cheese and avocado that blended together and looked like gooey boogers (honest review here!), but the burger tasted good. The fries were a little greasy but tasted good also."}
{"text":"So dang close to being what I wanted.  Half the employees are lovely, half seem to be deliberately working slowly when there's a huge line out the door.  The toppings are okay, nothing impressive.  The dressings are so so.  They charge way too much for salmon and avocado and tofu... I personally think at LEAST avocado or tofu should be a free add on if eggs and bacon are.  They need more people working, as this place is always busy and the employees always backed up, whether they're friendly or not."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is extremely over priced. It's cool if you're trying to eat healthy, which I do. It is nice to be able to get a salad with so many options, but avocado is extra money and meat is extra money?? My salad without either of those was around $7. It was okay, but I couldn't finish it all. I left it in my fridge for a couple of hours and it was completely soggy and watery and gross at the bottom. It was really disappointing, because it was pretty pricey for just a salad."}
{"text":"There are about 3-4 Hello Bistro's in the Pitt area.  A salad and burger chain?  I'm in!  This location is at the bottom of the hill of the UPMC/PittMed campus and open until 10pm.  I walked in at 9:55pm and the staff were very sweet and accommodating, working until the very last minute (probably beyond).    It was very tempting to choose a salad (healthy) vs a burger but I was starving.  I devoured my turkey and avocado burger.  Yum, no regrets!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I always get the salad, since I'm not a (beef) burger eater.  Pros: (1) Make-your-own salad concept: This is the only place I've been to in PGH that does it (2) Boylan soda fountain: I recommend the orange and cream sodas in particular (3) E'n P potato soup: Always a solid option (4) Fries: Though I've never ordered them, I've tried them from friends who have, and I believe they're fresh cut (albeit a bit on the greasy side) (5) Location: Convenient to Pitt and Presby (also, a healthier alternative to much of what's served at the Presby cafeteria--can't speak for Pitt...)  Cons (1) Salad content: Roughly 75% lettuce (2) Salad quality: It's okay, but nothing that blew me away, despite having tried both the make-your-own and preset versions (3) Price: $7.50 seems a bit steep for a salad that's mostly lettuce (see above).  As of the last time I visited, they were running a email coupon promo that you could access via a QR code, however. (4) Crowding: If you go for lunch during the school year, it can be hard to get a table (but then again, what place on Forbes or Fifth doesn't have this problem?)  Overall, an okay option for lunch in Oakland, esp. for those trying to eat healthier.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice in the last month and it was bad both times. The first time we called ahead with our order and went in to pick it up. It took us about 20 minutes to get there so we figured the order would be almost ready. We waited another hour. We were on our lunch break from work so we rushed back to the office with our order to discover that they made a mistake with almost everyone's lunch. Out of 5 meals they only got my order correct. Unfortunately, they undercooked mine.  The second time was just the other day (4/27/2016). Rather than call ahead we just went in and placed our orders in person. There were three of us this time. One person's order came out almost immediately, but he was missing half of what he had asked for. Our other two orders took over an hour to come out (just a salad and a hamburger - nothing crazy). We only got them because my coworker basically stormed their kitchen to get our food. The manager apologized and gave us two gift cards. We checked them today. The balance on both cards is ZERO.   The food isn't terrible, but it's definitely not worth the consistently bad service."}
{"text":"Waited a long time because there were only 3 up front, one on register, one on salads and one on chopping. Waited quite a while, after getting topping on my salad they knocked it over, the picked up the stuff on the corner and threw it in my salad. I had to ask for more chicken or else they wouldn't have done anything with chicken then didn't put back and threw away.... terrible customer service, young people working, no leadership. Go to the McCandless one! You'll be much happier!"}
{"text":"Was walking by and decided to check it out.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich with Apple slices on it which was surprisingly good.  Excellent fries and a chocolate shake too.  If you're into healthy choices, they had a huge salad bar surely to excite any vegetarian or paleo."}
{"text":"While the staff was friendly, my take out order was wrong--only discovered after I was home. The fries were hot, but so soggy they were almost inedible. Not what I expected from a business affiliated with Eat n' Park."}
{"text":"So they probably forgot about my order. Took 30mins to deliver one burger. And another one is missing! Now I am waiting for the other one. Hehe"}
{"text":"I've had both a burger and a salad here now, and I have to be honest while it isn't bad food it definitely isn't anything outstanding. The salad is basically $9 to have someone the EnP salad bar in a bowl and the burger was kind of a bland underwhelming sandwich. I do like the location and I like that i can order a salad and pick it up on the way home when I'm in a pinch for dinner, but I wish the quality of the items for the salads were a little higher. The service here has been excellent each time I've been and their sodas are admittedly really good. I just wish for a standalone EnP concept they'd up the quality a little bit."}
{"text":"I'm not an Eat 'n Park fan. I find the food in the same vein as a Denny's or Bob Evans (gag) and I find the contraction \"eat'n\" downright disrespectful to the English language. So when I first heard about Hello Bistro, I was skeptical, knowing they were part of the ENP family. I'm glad I gave it a try, because these salads are monstrous! For a flat $7 charge, you can create your own salad from seemingly endless toppings. I like that they offer tofu for the vegetarian crowd, but I've never felt the need to indulge after all of the other goodies I've selected. These salads are HUGE. I'm not sure how a person could finish one of these in one sitting. They just added quinoa to a long line of salad goodies which makes me happy. The standard fare are represented (carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc), along with some less prevelant salad bar items. You will be prompted by one of the friendly staff about how you would like your salad chopped. Small bites? Medium? Larger bites? Just tossed? Who has even given this much thought to salads before!? Now for the crunchies. Sure, you could get croutons, but I like the pumpkin seeds, slivered almonds, fried onion straws and dried cranberries for some needed crunch and texture. Hello Bistro has 14 different dressings to choose from. To date I've tried only two, the Asian Sesame and citrus lime vinaigrette. It will be difficult for me to stray from the latter from here on out, it was amazing, and I don't really even like salad dressing. Seriously, what is with people and ranch dressing??  I haven't tried the veggie burger or other sandwiches. I probably won't. I really like the salads. It's a quick walk down to Hello Bistro from work, so the next time I'm craving a really big salad, I know where I'll be heading."}
{"text":"I couldn't have made a better salad myself!  I generally do not like salad, but I'm trying to take the healthy route.  I made my own salad at hello bistro and the number of mix-ins is amazing and unbeatable!  So many different combinations, so little time!  I think you can't go wrong because they have premade options or you can create your own with whatever you like.  Since I added a protein option, my salad came to be $10, which is really not bad considering I chose the most expensive option (salmon). Not to mention!  The salads are huge!  I couldn't even finish mine in on sitting!  Definitely two healthy meals in one!  Great value!  For going during the lunchtime rush, I think I got out in a pretty timely fashion all things considered.  This place is everything salad works wishes it could be."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Hello Bistro to open ever since I took it upon myself to investigate what was actually going into this savanna of a shopping complex. Finally the hour is upon us and they are open!   I knew that it was owned by Eat'n Park so obviously it was a given that it would be a place with sure-good food (word to the wise: my usual go-to place for a simple meal when I'm hungry is Eat'n Park). But from what I heard, this place was supposed to be more like a Panera with table-side service, and it was! Your meal is brought to you after you order at the front desk and they give you a number to put on your table.   It's bigger inside that it looks on the outside. The decor is super trendy in regards to it being somewhat more modern with a fun flair; they have a chalkboard in the middle of the seating area where you can write whatever you want.   They specialize in salads, burgers, and grilled sam'iches. My two times being there already, I would recommend the apple & cheddar grilled cheese or the rockin' moroccan caesar salmon salad. Also try their handmade pumpkin milkshake to get in the fall season!  They offer takeout as well, which is ideal for ordering ahead of time before going home after work. Since it is owned by Eat'n Park, you can expect to order some of it's originals like a superburger, Eat'n Park coffee for $1, their classic soups (like chicken noodle, potato, and chili), and of course smiley cookies!   I give this place a four star rating because all-in-all it's a great, simple little café-like place to get a good meal or take something on the go. The place itself is visually appealing and the food is very tasty. If you're looking for something trendy and \"hip,\" then this isn't the place for you. But if you want a good meal and a good atmosphere, stop in and say Hello! ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Hello Bistro a few times, the 1st location I visited was in Oakland. Simple, clean food, with a build your own variety.   I can't say the same for this location in downtown Pittsburgh. Yes, the food and the concept was the same. But this place was a mess even the employees looked sloppy and handled the orders like a public school lunch lady. And nobody wore a belt or maybe it was \"show your plumber's crack while you make a salad\" day.   Trash was overflowing and debris were all over the floor from the ordering line to the exit. Even worse, the employees clearly saw this and just didn't care.  Bistro is that last thing I would think of after visiting this location."}
{"text":"This review is specific to this location.  We love hello in other locals.  Dirty, out of the following: Romain lettuce, avacado, ketchup, ice.  Workers clearly hated each other.  Selected salad items waited for 9 minutes before someone came to dress and cut.  6 people in party..it took more than 30 minutes for us all to be served.  Our frustration we kept to ourselves.  Others in restaurant flipped a lid on staff.  Take a picture, as that is only way you will see me there ever again."}
{"text":"The service is sometimes slow during busy hours, but the food is delicious. My favorite item is the over-easy cheeseburger. The French fries with their special ranch are DELICIOUS. Their create-your-own salads can be pricey but they are worth it! I've never had a bad experience here and the staff are always extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This place just opened and offers burgers and salads.  Burgers have set combos and my attempt to just get a burger with grilled onions only was rejected.  I had to get the mushroom-onion combo.  I specifically requested crisp fries, which came soggy.  The burger doesn't compare with others such as Five Guys and their fries are always crisp when requested that way. Goodbye Hello Bistro!!!"}
{"text":"Huge, yummy salads! Definitely your money's worth of food."}
{"text":"I like the concept, but the execution needs work. This place is so loud that not only did the employee get my order wrong (because she couldn't hear me), but my friend and I were barely able to have a conversation. Afterwards, we saw friends who gave us a tip: If you order one of the suggested salad combinations, it's more expensive than creating one (even with the same ingredients). The fresh-cut fries looked and smelled amazing, but it's disappointing that they're not made in a dedicated fryer (so people who have to eat gluten free will be left out)."}
{"text":"I liked the concept, but this location seemed sloppy. They were out of several items, my sandwich came 10 minutes before I got my salad, and they seemed to be messing up everyone's orders. It was just okay."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this place was introduced to the south hills, as it seemed like the kind of establishment to carry some vegan options. I was pretty wrong besides the veggie burger and some of the salads, but I guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up! anyways, I tried the quinoa avocado salad but I guess someone literally just forgot the avocado. so I paid $7 for a salad that was 90% kale, 5% quinoa, and 5% red peppers. Definitely not what I ordered, really disappointing"}
{"text":"I like Hello Bistro; it's simple, relatively fast, food is tasty, and they have craft sodas. My only complaint is that they advertise \"burgers and salads together\" but yet they only have one (very large) size salad and you can't get a smaller custom salad as a side to go with your burger."}
{"text":"What I hate about salads is not having enough dressing and/or mixing it into the lettuce completely.  No joke - I put my salads in a big container at home and shake them in dressing before eating them.  But now we have Hello Bistro!  I went for the first time today, and I love it!  I got the chicken apple salad and it was very very good.  Everyone was very helpful and friendly too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Burger is nothing special but definitely better than a regular fast food joint. Like the combination of egg and bacon on the burger. They also give you a decent amount of fries which comes piping hot in an oil soaked brown paper bag. Haven't tried their salads or soups but wish I had. Overall, decent place to get lunch. It's marginally better than fast food but I feel like the area has better restaurants that offer a lot more."}
{"text":"I placed a pickup order at this location for the first time. I paid $13 for a salad that was 1/2 of the way full and paid extra for avocado that was not on my salad. On top of that, the salad was pretty mediocre. Am definitely not pleased with my order and the price for what I received was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I like the concept here. I can customize my salad and dress it with ENP ranch, but it just never lives up to expectations - I am not referring to taste.  Today's experience:  waited at the register for 5 solid minutes while all of the visible employees made eye contact, but didn't say anything like \"oh someone will be with you shortly.\"  I started to wonder if I came in 5 minutes before close, but it was 3pm.  Cashier worked the register with her gloves on, the same ones that were being used to prepare food minutes ago.  My salad greens were turning brown, toppings bar was messy and commingled together (If I wanted celery I had to risk also getting beets, eggs, and chickpeas), and I ate a few bites where I felt like I was crunching on sand.  Unpleasant and disconcerting.  Ugh - I just don't think I can continue to eat here without risking illness."}
{"text":"Love that they give you a huge bowl and they fill it all the way up. The salad is made fresh right in front of you,  service was fast and it was crowded. Staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place for a salad. They do have a lot of options. I like that the grilled chicken is very simple, just seasoned with salt and pepper, but tasty. I do wish they had some more gluten-free dressing options but a minor quibble.   The burgers are what you'd expect from EnP, which are fine but you can do better now in Pittsburgh. A pretty good selection of burger options. I would go here for salads first though."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try hello bistro. When I looked at the pictures posted for some of the reviews I thought that the food looked really good. I was a little disappointed when I tried it however. To begin, our service was really disappointing. Everyone there was really annoyed and not excited to be working and not very friendly. I noticed that several other customers were bothered by their standoffish behavior. I ordered the caprese sandwich which looked good, but when I got it was a lot greasier than I expected. Overall, I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Imagine an upscale Subway, but with salads.  Add a Boylan soda fountain and you've got the idea.    My salad was made to order, fresh and tasty.  My only gripes are that the steak I got was ICE COLD, too chunky and a bit fibrous (yuck).  My lunchmate had the \"grilled\" chicken and it had zero seasoning (yuck too).  There's enough variety to the rest of the fixins that you don't need the $2 \"protein\" so don't bother.  Oh, and there's no baby spinach (boo!).  One major tip:  at the start, tell them to only fill the bowl with lettuce 3/4 of the way.  Otherwise, you'll run out of room for all the other \"fixins\" you'll want.  Oh, and the wonton chips, croutons, cranberries and sunflower seeds are at the end, just so you know.    Oh, and if you're a fan of cream soda, the Boylan fountain is something special.  About my salad:  It was designed by me, down to the number of times it was tossed and chopped, so how could it ever not be great?  Of course, that's kind of the idea."}
{"text":"Went with the make your own salad for lunch and think I'll be coming here at least 1x week!  The portion was huge and I wasn't hungry for the rest of afternoon...no 3:00 PM pick me up after eating this delicious salad.  I went with the mixed greens with an avacodo and various toppings.  They have so many topping options and they are unlimited people...UNLIMITED!  And they're not stingy with the scoops!   I got the citrus lime vinaigrette which was refreshing and went perfectly on top of a salad on a hot day.   You can choose how small you want your salad chopped which was a great option that I didn't know existed and then you can get your level of dressing.  I chose heavy but maybe next time I'll go with medium.  This was all for $9!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the Southside recently and decided to try Hello Bistro from all the good things that I had heard about their Oakland location.  Having heard from friends that they are known for their salads I decided to get the Jamaican shrimp salad and I couldn't resist a side of french fries.    I was disappointed in my salad as it was mainly leaves...I was hard pressed to find morsels of corn, black beans or avocado.  I feel like there was the same number of shrimp as there were black beans...now this might sound like a good thing to you considering how small black beans are and theoretically how many they could have poured on the salad but I think I counted 7 black beans in my salad...most were timidly hiding behind the numerous lettuce leaves that seemed to be overwhelming the bowl.  The dressing was lightly spread across all the leaves which I enjoyed rather than in a glob on top of the salad.     The real highlight was the french fries.  They give them to you in a bag...like anyone needs a bag of french fries.  But they sure were tasty, very fresh - you could tell them came right out of the fryer.  And they were thin - all in all the highlight of my meal."}
{"text":"Ventured over to Hello Bistro with my best friend while she was visiting for the weekend, and I loved it. I had the broccoli and cauliflower grilled cheese (it has a fancier name, but I can't remember it) and it was fantastic! I loved being able to try something different, and of course, I'll never turn down ANY variation of a grilled cheese. There was no line  (which I don't think is typical), and our food was prepared fast and accurately (seems normal, but you'd be surprised..), so no complaints from me :) thumbs up HB!"}
{"text":"HB is a casual local chain. Orders are made at the front with either a preset or self-selected salad options. Salads are tossed and brought to the table.   Pros: so many choices. Great menu and fresh produce. Love the drink selection of local cane sugar soda.   Cons: salads tend to be heavily dressed. Ask for light or on the side. Waits can also be long at lunch time."}
{"text":"I have hit this place up a few times for lunch and have always been pleased.   Now it's worth noting, this is primarily a soup, sala, and sandwich joint so don't come looking for a great sit down experience or dinner.   I will say the sandwiches are reasonably priced, and okay, nothing amazing, but for the cost and convenience is okay.   Fries are definately worth splurging on, though one order could be shared by two people getting lunch.      The soda fountain has Boylan's soda, stepping up over the traditional Pepsi/Coke options."}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek-ish Turkey Burger and french fries. The burger was nice and juicy, and the spices had a good kick without being over the top. The french fries were really, well spiced and soft, yet crunchy. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fries that taste like cousins of In-N-Out (which is a good thing), burgers that taste like cousins of Steak and Shake and Boylans available at the fountain and you get a solid place for lunch. I ordered their $8 combo that includes a solid portion of fries, solid burger (which is their Big Mac clone; but better) and a soft drink. The burger's \"secret sauce\" is nothing special but the patty, bread and toppings were fresh. They have a BBQ burger that looks like it would make up for their sauce. The only thing I was not impressed with at all was poor service. Either it's a stressful job or no one is happy to be there."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro has the best fast-food salads downtown. There are tons of toppings and no limit to what you can add to your salad. Choose from fresh and roasted veggies, at least six different kinds of cheeses, a variety of proteins, and lots of yummy, crunchy add-ins.  It does get very busy at the lunch rush, and the counter can get unpleasantly messy during peak times. That's why I always go around 11am. Lately I've been ordering online as well.  I see a lot of reviews that say the salads are packed with lettuce rather than toppings. Well, if you get the kale mix, all those extra greens are a good thing! And just ask if you want another scoop of a certain topping. Staff have always been willing to do so in my experience."}
{"text":"Ordered online went in at my designated time to get it and it wasn't ready which I understand at lunch time it's busy.  People walking around doing nothing, asking people what their names are and skipping orders.  Spent almost entire lunch hour waiting on my food.  Completely unorganized."}
{"text":"Lots of seating, fresh food (can speak to Quinoavacado salad), healthy options, friendly and well staffed employees, under $10 lunch, cool music, modern/simple ambiance.  All my check boxes for a good lunch experience.  A great, welcomed restaurant addition to the cool, healthy eating options many of us in downtown Pittsburgh are happy to see.  I'm glad you are here!"}
{"text":"solid salads that are not at all hesitant about volume. there is a substantial bed of greens with a wide selection of ingredients that should work for any salad enthusiast.  -they might initially skimp on topping, whether out of policy or to keep the ingredients from falling out of the bowl, but they do add more if you ask -the chili vinaigrette dressing did not really stand out when i added it to my meal -for first timers: note that there are roasted vegetables later on in the buffet of selections, so if you prefer those to raw ones, anticipate that and wait for later to add peppers, broccoli, cauliflower"}
{"text":"I came here because my boyfriend raves about the one in Oakland. Stopping in for my lunch break (which is 1 hour) to grab a salad. Ordered the BBQ chicken salad, which was mediocre. The salad had a lot of the hard ends of the romain head which was a little disappointing. I also waited for about 25 minutes. That doesn't seem like a long time, but when the salad bar is laid out in front of the employees and it's not busy, I expected it to be a little more speedy. With only 20 minutes left before having to return to work, I asked if I could have my salad to go, to which the girl handed me a bag that had been sitting on the counter for quite some time.  I'm just so disappointed, especially since I have been hearing about Hello Bistro for a while and how great it is. I was hoping to have the same experience.  I will choose somewhere else to go to lunch before returning here."}
{"text":"Had a burger, it was decent, fries are freshly cut. The soda machine features a company that uses pure cane sugar with is a nice touch. The salads looked better than the burger - very big."}
{"text":"I'm SO glad this place opened in Oakland.  There aren't many places to get a great salad, and the existing choices prior to Hello were $$$$.  The only strike I have against this place is that they are too busy for the staff that will fit behind the counter, but I guess you really can't fault them for that.  The manager was chopping my salad and admitted they were NOT prepared for how busy they've been--not sure why, as Pitt's medical, nursing, and public health schools are all right around the corner--not to mention the three large hospitals!  There are some health-minded people that have been deprived of health restaurant choices for quite some time...  Anyway, the food.  I did the \"create your own\" salad, where someone walks you through the bar and adds veggies, cheeses, and proteins at your instruction.  They then add a dressing, mix it all up, chop it, and fill a to-go container.    Bonus points for the \"vintage\" Boylan's soda fountain--YUM!  I know I'll be back to Hello Bistro quite often once fall semester starts."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We have been driving by Hello Bistro for a number of weeks and had been thinking about trying it but had never managed to stop in before.  Whenever we arrived in the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was how busy it was.  As a matter of a fact there was no open seating available which didn't really bother us since we were getting our meal to go.  Hello Bistro is the type of place where you grab a menu and proceed to a counter before ordering.  If you are getting one of the items off the menu you are sent away with a number.  You are also given the option of building your own salad and can proceed through the line (ala subway or chipotle) telling the people what you want.  On this afternoon I wasn't feeling like eating too healthy and so for my lunch I went with the broccaflower grilled cheese and then added on a side of French fries.  My wife and her parents all ordered salads and we stood around off to the side while waiting.  After about a 15 minute wait our food was ready and we collected it and headed out.  I unfortunately didn't get to eat my meal immediately and instead it took around 20 minutes for me to get to it.  At that point the fries still were pretty hot while my grilled cheese was luke warm.  I really enjoyed the flavor of my grilled cheese and liked the healthy chunks of broccoli and cauliflower throughout.  The bread for it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but I will chalk that up to the delay I had before I ate it.  I also really enjoyed the fries here as they were seasoned nicely and crispy.  They came inside their own brown bag which was covered in grease stains whenever it was handed over to me.  My wife and her parents really ended up enjoying their salads as well and thought that they had good flavors and were large.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I would really like to try something else the next time, maybe a salad, but everything that our party had was good."}
{"text":"I keep finding sand in my shrimp salad.  I don't think the shrimp are being properly washed."}
{"text":"Imagine Eat n' Park and Panera had a baby. Hello Bistro would be it.  Having never been here before, and after my friend, Franny, asked like four times in a row to go there, I found myself looking at Hello Bistro's burger/sandwich menu on a really nice evening in June. I ordered the regular Bistro Burger, a cheeseburger with all the fixing's. For $2 more, I added a bag of fries (amazing BTW) and a Boylan's soda. If you've never had Boylan's, you need to try it. I've never seen it in a fountain before, but it was equally as good as the bottles I've found elsewhere in the area.   We sat outside to people watch and wait for our food. They nicely brought it the whole way out! :) Back to the food; the burger was great, juicy and cooked just right. Toppings were perfect, too, crispy lettuce and a ripe tomato. Fries were in a little bag, and AANNDD, they have Eat N' Park's Ranch Dressing (the number one condiment of all time) on a chilled pump at the condiment station. I'm not going to be bashful here, I had 2 whole cups of it with my fries. I'll make up for it, I said, by running a little further tonight, and I did. :-P Sorry, got side tracked there; the fries were great. spiced and crispy, just the way I like them.  I recommend people watching while you stuff your face with burger. I enjoy it, and the people watching is great on Carson Street. So many weirdo's.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Delicious salad with an awesome concept.  I agree with the reviewer who said it's like a Chipotle for salads.  Well priced, too!  Highly recommend for lunch or take-out."}
{"text":"Each time I've lunched at Hello Bistro I've ordered a salad with exception of my most recent visit, where I went rogue and got a turkey burger.    As far as salad bars go Hello Bistro has several things in their favor.  First, their staff will create the salad for you behind a glass barrier so you don't have people stuffing their fat hands into the toppings.  So it's a nice clean process.  Secondly, the options for salad toppings are endless and very fresh.  Edamame?  Yes!  Hearts of Palm?  Yes!  And the list goes on and on.  Finally, they have a nice selection of salad dressings ranging from tasty and healthy to really tasty and very fattening.  And then the staff person that is helping you will cut the salad to your preference.  Prefer tiny little salad bites?  Not a problem.  Want your salad with a medium chop?  You've got it.  And they also shake it like a Polaroid picture for you so you have an even distribution of toppings.    Other items range from burgers, soup, and grilled cheeses.  The turkey burger I had was tasty.  These items do not come with a side.  So if you want fries n'at, you'll pay a little more.  Hello Bistro also has a hip soda machine.  And I mean that it isn't the typical Coke or Pepsi selection; here you can find cream soda.  That's right, cream soda."}
{"text":"**HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!** Wish I could give 0 stars. Walked in and saw they had Gluten Free items on their menu, great! was excited. Walked up to the counter and the girl who was taking our order was 1. So quiet that I couldn't hear her, 2. Didn't look at you when she talked, 3. Was very rude when I asked her what was in the salad dressing. I asked what kind of oil was used, she looked at me like I was rude for asking and said, \"I dunno.\" I told her I needed to know because I have a wheat and soy allergy. I asked her to ask the manager. She huffed and looked over at him and asked, he then was rude and said, \"there's no oil in the dressing, it's cream based.\" I said, I need to see the ingredients. He then got an attitude and I said, \"you're not going to show me?\" My boyfriend then asked to see the chef or manager, he then said, \"hold on\" and he looked at a menu. He didn't speak up and I thought he said no soy, and then he got rude and said, \"yes. Theres. Soy.\" I walked away and said, \"was that so hard???\"   So all in all if you have any kind of food allergy or issue, stay away from Hello Bistro."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times, with mixed experiences. Usually it's fine, but the last time I ordered pick up, got back to work, and found a completely different order. I went all the way back and they just casually handed me a different bag with my order. Eh. Annoying. So yesterday I went in and instead of going the usual salad route, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (to go). I stood over by the spot where take out is ready and watched the cook come out of the bathroom. He dried his hands on his pants and then went to the kitchen to cook. He grabbed the bread out of the bag with his bare hands, and then separated the cheese from the stack (again, no gloves). Is this common practice? It's probably better for me to just not be able to see what's happening in restaurant kitchens. I really had to choke that sandwich down after what I saw. Meanwhile, it's funny that the people chopping the salads wear gloves. They aren't even touching the food. It's almost like the gloves are for show. I did notice the guy that took my money was gloved, so I'm guessing that pair isn't providing the same cleanliness barrier we'd hope for after he handles money.   So all this to say, I'm probably not going to stop coming here, but I'm disappointed that it's not what I thought."}
{"text":"We came early (around 10:30), so it was quiet. The seating area was very clean and well lit.  The girl making my salad was pleasant enough. She was really quiet though, so I felt like I kept repeating \"what?\" Which was kind of annoying.  Only thing I really dislike is that they are REALLY skimpy on the toppings. This isn't our first time here and it's by far the \"smallest\" salads we've ever had (by small I mean toppings - always PLENTY of lettuce lol).  $24 for 2 chicken salads and 2 drinks. Decent enough. We'll be back. It's a nice switch from burgers or tacos."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the brand-spanking-new Hello Bistro and was reminded of a Panera with more character (and more grease). You order at the counter, take a number card, and then your food is delivered to your table. As a bonus, they bus your tables after you're done eating. It was quite crowded for lunch today, but the turnover was quick and there were always tables available, so I was impressed.  I found the fries to be a bit greasy but a great deal at $2 for a large paper bag of them. I see some late-night snacking to be done here.   The salads are the real winner here. Big bowls overflowing with fresh veggies and meat in any combination you can imagine (or you can cheat like me and pick one of their standards.) It's a tad on the expensive side for casual fast food, but probably one of the healthiest lunch options on the South Side if you stick to their salads.   Overall, this will make a nice addition to South Side lunch options and an easy quick dinner option when you want a burger or a salad. The tin-style ceiling, exposed brick, and general niceness of the decor also take it a step up for your average lunch fare."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Just went for the first time today, and boy, I really enjoyed it.  My semi- niece suggested we go, she having been previously, and me willing to try anything once.  She'd mentioned the make-your-salad option as well as the burgers, sandwiches, and sides, so I figured I knew what to expect.  However, WRONG!!  I expected the usual serve yourself salad bar, and I thought maybe I'd try a burger instead...until I saw the salad set-up, and I knew I had to have one.  First, though, the place is small with quite limited seating.  I imagine that when the place is really busy, getting a table could be quite the cutthroat proposition!  Fortunately, it wasn't so bad on this Sunday afternoon after 1:30pm.  There was a line of maybe 8 people ahead of us, but it went surprisingly quickly.  So, the salad process...they pull out a clear plastic bowl about the size of a child's sand bucket, and you select your greens from half a dozen huge bins.  I went with regular iceberg, and they packed it into the sand pail.  While you pay an extra $2 for your protein, I went with chicken.  Then you get unlimited toppings--dozens of options--and I added on a lot of them!  Even some red quinoa and roasted beets.  So I'm eyeing this overflowing sand pail and thinking, if I even BEGIN to mix in the dressing, I'm gonna have salad spread from one end of the table to the other...And then another employee took my sand pail and asked if I wanted small, medium, or large bites, to which I replied \"????\".  Turns out they use these rocker blades to chop the salad to various bite sizes.  Being new to this, I want with medium to be on the safe side.  Then, wonder of wonders, they have you choose your dressing {of many}, ask if you want it light, medium or heavy, scrape your salad into a huge bowl, pour on the dressing and MIX IT UP FOR YOU, then put it back into your sand pail!  Now how cool is that!!  I think it's a great concept.  I also got a cup of potato soup, which was purely awesome!  They have Pepsi products rather than Coke, which always makes me sad, but I muddled through.  Although the place is way out of my way, I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I like the concept of Hello Bistro, but disappointed it was just Eat N Park food rebranded.  Not that I don't like Eat n Park mind you, it's just I expected something different. I've been to Six Penn Kitchen and Porch, and they are so far removed from their parent company, that there is nothing on their menu that goes back to Eat n Park.  Hello Bistro is the same food at Eat N Park, right down to the EnP Burger and Smiley cookies.  With that said, I did like the modern atmosphere, and the choose your salad toppings is a nice touch. So is the Boylans Soda fountain and table service after you order.  Again though, this is Eat N Parks menu in a different place. If you're into that sort if thing..."}
{"text":"So the salad was fabulous once we got past the Asian girl who loaded me down with onions and then tried to pick them all out. Although I protested SHE protested louder about HOW She wasn't waisting all that lettuce. Finally a manager showed up and saw it my way. Price is great, manager is great. Students shouldn't work when they have crappy attitudes."}
{"text":"Worth the visit for the salads!  The other posts here saying it's just like Eat n Park are sadly mistaken.  There are way more toppings to pick from, everything is super fresh, and there is a great dressing selection.  They have pre selected salads you can order but you're better off making your own.  I highly recommend the chicken with the fiesta seasoning."}
{"text":"Just had a veggie burger.  Would not recommend this.  I got it to go and ate it about 15 minutes later.  The bun was smashed and soggy.  The burger was mushy.  There was a razor thin piece of tomato and very wilted lettuce.  I had two bites and threw it away."}
{"text":"Woo found a healthy place in DT Pittsburgh.  Had the salmon burger and it was really good!  Woman at the cashier was super friendly, one of the guys on the salad line not so much, but he seemed like the exception not the rule."}
{"text":"Ordered the Roasted Root salad. Great flavor!  Ordered the tomato bean soup.  Thin as water so not much tomato flavor. It was pumped uo with some sort of spicy which was not in the description. Rude awakening on first sip. Too spicy for any other flavor  I love spicey, but this time.  Friend ordered Bistro burger. Average, he says. Small, hence \"bistro\". He got the fries. Fresh cut, thin. Somewhat limp and ok flavor. Tea was good."}
{"text":"Had a great burger with a nice open atmosphere at the new hello bistro in mccandless crossing.  What a great space with tasty comfort food.  I am not a big drinker so this place gets the job done for the kids and I.  Look forward to trying more of their menu. Eat n park co. Has hit a homerun on this concept.  I can't speak for the rest of the locations in the Pittsburgh area but this one, at least for the moment, has got a good thing going."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! The fries are a bit too salty. Great selection of salads and sandwiches. Servers are attentive and kind."}
{"text":"There are many reasons why I choose to skip Hello Bistro but first let me start with some positive thoughts. I do like that you can design your own salad and it seems to be enough salad for two meals. That about sums up what I like about this restaurant.  On my last visit there seem to be a lot of people just sitting at the tables waiting for their orders. The tables were sticky and not clean at all. The noise level in this restaurant drives me insane. There are few restaurants like this in Pittsburgh that I choose to not eat in because of how loud they are and this one is the loudest. I suppose noise level is hard to control when the restaurant is a cement block that has metal table and metal seats. In fact the food is even served on metal trays, sort of reminds me of a prison.  As far as the quality of the food, there is a lot to be desired. The sauces are bland and the fries are very greasy. It is a real turn on to have fries served in a greasy paper bag.  With so many other choices around I do not see myself or my family eating at Hello Bistro again."}
{"text":"Attempted to have lunch at this location today wasted over an hour and left hungry and frustrated!!! It's a shame bc I have eaten at HB in the past and I do like the food however, this one is clearly so poorly managed it's a shame. When we arrived there was only 1 group ahead of us that had ordered and was waiting  for someone to make their salads. My Husband ordered a salad and proceeded to wait with them. He arrived at our table sometime later surprised that the kids and I still had not received our burgers,fries & shake. He said he figured we would be done eating it took so long for his salad!  Waited another 15 mins then went to find someone to ask - had to wait behind another woman complaining about her wait. Was told by a confused teenager that it would be just a few more mins and when I asked she gave me my daughters shake which she just pulled out of the fridge! Went up 2x more during the hour wait- by now my husband had long finished his huge salad. Went up again and they brought us one burger - no explanation not even 1/2 our order! Meanwhile the table behind us who I watched come in well after was served!   Went back again and attempted to get someone's attention at which point the confused girl said \"oh yeah it's coming\"as she shifted thru about a dozen receipts on the counter! I said forget it I want a refund and I will take the kids elsewhere and feed them! She said ok hold on and never returned. Meanwhile the manager was refunding another customers $ who was walking out without food! Waited at the counter after he left  - finally asked again a girl making salads the please get me a manager! Finally she came out I said I've waited over an hour and don't even have 1/2 our food to which she replied she was sorry - I asked for a refund and she did give me my money back. As we left another couple (that came in after us)  said to us as left 'we gave up too 40 mins and I just saw them put our burger on the grill!\" We will definitely not be going back!"}
{"text":"I had kept seeing this place around town and finally decided to stop in before a movie to check it out. I was a bit surprised when I walked in seeing the salad bar. I wasn't expecting that. For some reason I was under the impression this was more of a burger place. There is nothing wrong with a salad bar at all. Just saying that I wasn't expecting it and as I was looking for a burger, that's what I went after. Once I figured out where to place my order, I had to ask the waitress for a menu because there is just a chalk board with specials written on it. She seemed a little annoyed that I would ask and was not very friendly. I ended up getting a special anyway.  I ordered the En'P Superburger Combo for $7.49. Now I know this sounds crazy but at the moment I placed my order everything fell into place...En'P Superburger...Smiley Face...this is a spinoff of Eat n' Park!!! How did I not realize this earlier?!  I've had a Superburger before and it was decent. The fries weren't bad either. It was nice that they had a ranch dispenser with the condiments. My food came out hot and fairly quick. But it wasn't really what I was expecting or hoping for. I thought this was going to be a something new and different that I hadn't seen before. So needless to say, the experience was somewhat deflated. I'm not going to judge on that though.  The food was average just as it is at Eat n' Park. The service wasn't the best and I felt like an annoyance to the waitress when I asked for a menu.  On the plus side, they have a Boylan's Soda Machine which was excellent. I tried both the ginger ale and birch beer and greatly enjoyed both.  I probably would not go back for a burger but wouldn't mind trying the create your own salad.  That's what I find ironic about my experience. I did not expect a salad place and wanted a burger. Got a burger and walked away wanting a salad."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and really liked the setup for their salads, which was my focus for ordering. I'll admit I almost went for a milkshake instead. Their employees were friendly and willing to help.  My order was the Sesame Soba Salmon Salad. Their website menu lists it as: Kale + Spinach + Salmon + Soba Noodles + Avocado + Edamame + Sesame Seeds x Thai Peanut Dressing. If you look at the picture online and look at what I had...a bit of inconsistency, but that's to be expected since pictures for websites are meant to look appealing. I did get a lot of kale, few leaves of spinach, sesame seeds, lots of edamame, one slice of avocado, bits of noodles (no whole noodles..they appeared chopped), and chopped pieces of salmon. The dressing was delicious and the whole salad tasted really good together, which is why I'm a fan of this place. I would have liked whole noodles in my salad, but hey..maybe next time.  I also got a bottle of water and a fruit bowl. Their fruit bowls are my favorite because it's not a little cup filled with two kinds of fruit. It's an actual bowl size with fresh, chopped fruit like mango, apples, strawberries, and a few other kinds of fruit that I can't recall at the moment. It was fabulous."}
{"text":"I visited Hello Bistro for the first time today and wanted to try their Salmon Avocado burger since it was their special. I took it to go and when i got to class i realized that they gave me a hamburger instead of a salmon burger. I called to see if they can start making me the Burger so i could pick it up but the person on the phone HUNG UP. Then when i got there they tried to blame me when I don't eat red meat so why in the world would i ask for it. They were so rude when i had to walk back to get my new food. On top of that it took so long to get my new meal. Terrible Customer service and I do not want to return after that Piada is right across the street with better customer service. Yeah"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is a great idea. The quality is slightly better than your standard fast food fare, the prices aren't too bad for a regular lunch spot (although $10-12 for a salad that won't fill you up can really add up if you go on a regular basis), and the staff is usually nice.  Where this location falters compared to other locations is in consistency and order accuracy. Perhaps it's the INSANE lunch rush, but ordering ahead will result in an inaccurate order 90% of the time. Literally. My wife has almost never received an accurate order when ordering ahead. Breakfast, lunch? It doesn't seem to matter. They can't get it right. Unfortunately, unless you're looking to spend half of your lunch break in the crazy line, ordering ahead (and the possibility of doing so) is the way to go. Or, like we end up doing most of the time...we simply avoid this Hello Bistro altogether.  I would love to see this location work out the kinks, as being a locally-owned and operated chain is always great to support, but for the price and quality, the inability to get orders correct will likely drive some people away. Fortunately for Hello Bistro, the lines hint that they won't struggle, regardless of service quality...which means they won't need a reason to improve."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro was the first restaurant I ate at in Oakland and I was hooked from day one. It puts every salad I get at another restaurant to shame, as the toppings are endless and so deliciously fresh. I tend to leave feeling full, but not post-Chipotle-burrito stuffed. Quinoa, endamame, fresh blueberries, Kalamata olives, fresh mozzarella balls-- essentially everything you would find in a dream salad bar.   I'm sure the other reviewers have summed up how great this place is, so I'll leave it at this: hungry for vegetables? Go to Hello Bistro. Thirsty for vintage, real-sugar (no HFCS) pop? Go to Hello Bistro. Really feeling a beer with your Eat n' Park burger? Go to Hello Bistro.   You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"It's an entire enterprise centered on salads, customized and created right in front of you.  And that's enough alliteration for one review.  The value proposition is VERY simple.  If you want a salad, and you want to have a lot of control over what goes into it chosen from a variety of options, then go here.  If you want anything else in the world, don't go here (they have other menu items, but nothing that can't be beat elsewhere).  I will give a special mention of their beverage selection.  Pretty good unsweetened iced tea sits next to a fountain with multiple Boylan brand (whoops) sodas.  Better than your normal soft drink offerings.  (Oh, and because you have to basically go down the counter with someone as he or she makes your salad, I think it would be a hard place to go with groups, since there will be substantial lag in between the times the first and last people receive their salads--though it's not as big a problem as it would be at other restaurants, since you don't have to worry about your salad getting cold.)"}
{"text":"You're amazing and I love you. I'd live to 110 if I could as healthy as I do when I eat at you every day. Thank you for all of the dietary fiber. Thank you for the healthy protein. Other restaurants need to step up and turn their ratios of healthy to unhealthy things on their heads like you have. Good job."}
{"text":"Oh my word! They have the BEST turkey burger I have ever tasted!!! Sautéed onion, a roasted (poblano?) pepper on top, pepper jack cheese perfectly melted and some amazing mayo! I can not wait to have this again!"}
{"text":"The staff that work here are probably the most energetic, happiest people you will ever meet. They submit themselves to your every whim. Oh you want EXACTLY two artichoke hearts? You want every sauce as a side with no charge and labeled? You want more of that heart of palm?  They did everything with a smile and more.  The salad itself was just a salad, but it was in a container as large as my head (I have a pretty big head). I split the salad with a friend it was so big, and she loved the homemade ranch while I loved the Asian sesame sauce. But, we loved all the sauces!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Hello Bristro craze however after my trip to this location it'll likely be my last.  I have gone to HB a handful of times, this being my first at this location. It was a Friday afternoon-November 11, around 4/5pm and the place wasn't too busy but it looked like I had just missed the rush with the place looking a mess.   When it came to order the dressing, I noticed the amount first poured wasn't as much as I'd like and asked for a little more extra. The employee poured way more than necessary. He was nice so maybe he isn't a salad eater or maybe he made a mistake. Also, while this went on I was distracted by another employee at the end of the line eating croutons.   In retrospect I should've asked for a new salad but I decided to try it. Needless to say I had to throw it away after a few bites. Nothing worse than throwing away your lunch while at work. I emailed HB about my experience and was contacted after then but when I tried calling back after minutes of ringing my call was eventually disconnected.   Ultimately I feel like this falls on management. Keeping a clean restaurant, proper training of employees, and enforcing safe food handling standards is the job of the manager. The employee, again, was kind and I sincerely feel like he didn't realize the amount was way too much. Training employees better on serving sizes would help this issue. As for the cleanliness and employees eating around food-it's up to the manager to correct these issues.   I like the idea of HB and would love to see these issues resolved (also not a fan of the ordering process, paying first seems to slow this down-also it always seems to be understaffed). I would love to return but until changes are made I'm going to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The restaurant was so well organized that I guessed it had to be a chain; imagine my surprise when I discovered it's a spin-off of EatnPark. The menu is varied and healthful. I was disappointed to receive nothing but a grilled cheese sandwich for what I paid, but my husband and I could only eat half of his Buffalo chicken salad between us, so a salad is definitely the most economical option. The restaurant was noisy, but the Buffalo seasoning is very well done. Even at a bust dinnertime in a Friday the eat-in wait was not very long."}
{"text":"I have been here on my last two trips to Pittsburgh. I am a big fan of the the BBQ Chicken Salad. Overall I love the concept and the toppings they have available. The price is also very reasonable for the size salad you get."}
{"text":"Very good food prompt courteous service. Smelled a bit heavy of burgers, which could be a pro or a con . . . . . One drawback, no wifi. Although you can catch a usable signal if you sit near the front of the restaurant, the fact that they do not have wifi seems insane given the location and type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Note: Ron Swansons and other meat lovers beware. This isn't a meat heavy place.   Just your average buffet, except not really. I've had salads that were awesome, that were meh, healthy and wildly anything but. With a huge assortment of fresh ingredients, fruits and vegetables and no weight limit to what you can add, Hello Bistro is a salad lover's paradise.   Their proteins are decent in the salad, but you're not trying to get the most delicious chicken or the best salmon by coming here. It's healthy, well done, but rather bland in my opinion. The chicken specifically tends to lack flavor. I would say the same for the other proteins. Otherwise, you have tons of choices for fruits, veggies, crunchy additions and dressings!  I wouldn't recommend their burgers or other sandwiches simply because they're pretty much average. The same goes for the fries. It's great if a member of your party wants something other than salad, but it won't be as good as the salad will be."}
{"text":"Good food. A little pricey, but wonderful that you have such a variety of options for veggies, fruits, toppings and even meat. If you've never been there before, it can be a little intimidating, but you can't go wrong with what they have!"}
{"text":"Another concept restaurant by the Eat n' Park group (see Porch). However, the latter is good and HB is bad. The sandwiches are small, overpriced, and dry. The salad bar, while boasting an impressive 55 items is: 1. not self-service, 2. not particularly inspired, and 3. tastes like the stuff you'd get at a regular, crappy Eat n' Park salad bar. The only real Pro is the Boylan's soda fountain but it hardly justifies regular patronage."}
{"text":"Very friendly service even during a busy weekday lunch time. I had a build-my-own type salad. The people behind the counter made it carefully, and remembered to ask what I wanted."}
{"text":"Friendly busy place. Great options for vegetarians! I had the California burger (substituted the turkey with a veggie patty) with some hand made fries, and my meal really hit the burger craving spot. Would go back to try other stuff on their menu. I'm not a salad person but I noticed they had numerous options to customize salads."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very relaxed. The place is really clean too. Service was excellent. I went here for breakfast and got an egg sandwich which was good. It could have used some seasoning like salt and pepper but overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"The last time we were here, my wife and I both ordered burgers.  I asked for mine to be medium well, and the woman working there said they cook all the burgers to proper temp. and do not cook them to order.  Well, when our burgers arrived, both of them were pink in the middle . . .  We flagged down one of the teens working there and asked him if he thought our burgers were cooked properly, and he said no, and offered to have new ones made for us.  The replacement burgers were a little overcooked in my opinion, but at least they were not pink.     Overall, I still think this place in A-O.K. . . . Cheers!"}
{"text":"The burger was just O.K.  The fries were extra.  This place is a little confusing for ordering, and it is kind of small on the inside, and can get pretty crowded at lunchtime.   The salads look pretty good, but I haven't tried one yet."}
{"text":"Great place to get a fast healthy lunch.  Their salad bar is amazing with so many options.  I love the custom option that lets you add whatever you want for a set price (with the exception of some premium items like the meats and shrimp that cost extra).  I really like how they will chop the salad for you to your desired size and add in your desired amount of salad dressing so you can get it exactly the way you want it.  I found the medium level salad dressing to be slightly heavy so I'll probably go for light in the future. They also have some breakfast sandwiches (probably not quite so healthy).  There is a soda fountain machine offering an interesting selection of natural sodas.  The line can get pretty long during peak weekday hours but it moves quickly, but if you avoid peak lunch times then you can get in and out of there pretty fast.  All the staff are friendly and the ingredients are really fresh.  There is also a small seating area."}
{"text":"We had salads and sandwiches for lunch when we were here.  My husband had the Pot roast sandwich, and said it was good.  My daughter had the Greek Salad which looked fantastic!  I had the pick your own toppings salad and would ABSOLUTELY recommend you order this.  You can get it with a meat option, or without (I did chicken)and there has to be about 50 different choices of veggies and other toppings.  Even the lettuce options were plentiful and fresh.  I want to say there were 10-15 dressings to choose from as well.  Also, they chop it all for you and ask how you want it chopped.  Very clean, lots of seating inside and fresh food :)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Hello Bistro for lunch! Upon walking in you place your order at the counter and then they give you a number and serve you your food. They have a ton of different salad options, including making your own. I saw probably 50 different toppings you could get on your salad.   They have different featured items and I went with the turkey burger that came with pineapple, arugula, and a chipotle mayo. Unfortunately, they were out of the chipotle mayo which was a bummer. If this is a special featured item you are pushing- I'd like to see them have all of the ingredients. However it was still super tasty and fresh so I was too upset. It was cooked perfectly and had a really good flavor! Sometimes turkey burgers can taste strange but this was the perfect texture and size. My husband had French fries with his burger and they were fresh cut and seasoned perfectly! Did I mention they serve Eat N Park ranch dressing, which is the best!   The best part was our entire lunch was only $15 and we left stuffed! Such a good deal. I will be back soon to try the featured strawberry chicken salad before it disappears after summer!"}
{"text":"First of all, I am extremely disappointed in one of my favorite places to go grab a quick and healthy salad at because of a staff member. I usually come once a week for lunch to pick up Cobb salads ( without the blue cheese, tomato, and diced egg, due to dislike and being allergic to some of those ingredients) for both my sister and I. We usually have no problems at all, it's quick and easy with friendly staff..  this time was different and really got everyone's attention in the whole restaurant who were about to order and were already eating... when I ordered the two Cobb salads without the blue cheese, tomatoes and eggs, the staff member Crystal instantly shot me down and said I can not order that because I'm removing three ingredient and that \"I'm better off making my own salad\" in a very rude and snarky attitude. I told her I come here every week ordering the same thing and they make it with no problems .. she continued to raise her voice to me in a yelling manner (now everyone is staring at her in the whole restaurant) saying I \"don't understand\" and that I can only substitute or remove only one ingredient from the specialty salads .. I understand that if it a policy but it has never address to me in all of the 10 plus times I have ordered at this restaurant.. nor is it posted anywhere in the restaurant or on the menu that I ordered from today.. even other employees who were working at the time apologized for her outrages unprofessional behavior and tone while talking to a customer... I am so upset that a business I love to eat at often hires such an unprofessional rude staff member"}
{"text":"This place satisfies all of my needs! It's cheap, fast, can be healthy, and filling. I've been here twice in the past week and both times have left satisfied. The first instance my friend and I shared a California scrambler ($5!!) and fries ($2). The fries were thin and plentiful, and the people behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating when I asked for mayo.  The second time my friend got a John Wayne BBQ Burger ($6.50) and fries and we were able to finish it comfortably. Looking at most of their menu items they seem to offer many health aware options such as turkey burgers and creating your own salad. The place is affordable and convenient. Definitely great for college students who are looking to fill their stomachs and not overeat while not spending a fortune!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in Oakland for a yummy salad filled with just about any veggie you could possibly want for $7 (and only $2 more for added protein). Though the line can be ridiculously long during a weekday lunch, I still come here from time to time to get my salad fix.   One thing I noticed that they changed is the way they do their to-go salads. Before, you would walk in, order, and go through the salad bar line with someone and choose your toppings regardless of if you made your own or chose of their premade salads. At the end they would ask if it was for here or to go and box it up accordingly.   Today when I ordered my old standby to go, excited to add a bunch of other stuff on it, I was given a number and told my salad would be brought out to me upon paying. After a few \"um, wut?\" minutes of confusion, my salad was brought out to me overdressed and barren of all of the delicious num nums I've come to crave. Luckily the staff was super DUPER accomodating when I said inquired about the change and made me the salad I wanted at no extra charge and no 'tude. Woot!"}
{"text":"I usually tend to enjoy Hello Bistros food, but this visit left me wanting more. Or something different.  I visited in order to use a birthday coupon for a free item that they graciously sent me for being an email list member. I used it for an Autumn Apple Chicken and Pear salad. While the salad itself was decent, it wasn't fantastic. The dressing wasn't sweet enough for the type of salad it is. The time spent waiting in line and to get my food for dine in was ridiculously long for 2:30pm on a Tuesday as well.  I also don't make it a habit to dine places where there is a lack of outlets to plug into. In 2017, to dine in a restaurant without any outlets is weird and inconvenient.  Will I be back? Sure. But only for their grilled cheese and tomato soup."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is a new chain and is owned by local restaurant chain Eat N' Park so yes, they have smiley cookies.  The similarities end there.  Upon entering the Bistro you find out that they have BEER. Yes, that's right. BEER.  Now we gaze upon the menu.  What initially may appear simple quickly becomes complicated.  IMO a tad to complicated for lunchtime when I visited.  They have a bunch of burgers and I had one.  It was excellent. Get one when you want to be bad. Greasy and delicious.    Upon my next visit I ventured to the dark arts of the salad.  So much so I brought my Hello Bistro Ninja master coworker to guide me through the plethora of options.  I think without her help I would not have been as happy with the place.  She showed me how to select the correct combinations to yield and excellent good for you salad. Overall I was pleased.    Upon my third visit I got one of their pre selected salad varieties and if you believe their nutrition info it had under 300 calories for the big bowl it came in.  Something with apples.  At any rate it was also quite good.  The service is fast and the place is clean.  Prices are fair to good.  Did I mention the soda fountain has some really good pop?  Yes pop. Not soda and I'm not even from here.   So venture on down and see how you like it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been a huge fan since Hello Bistro originally opened in Oakland.   If I'm ever craving a good salad I come here! I am never disappointed with the amount of toppings they offer. Usually when I stop in, there are more options than the last. I always build my own salad and the employees always load it up! I do order almost all the vegetables and the somehow manage to fit it all in that plastic container. I've never had a bad experience at any of their restaurants. I've eaten here so many times, and will continue to!   There are not many places that you can order whatever you want on your salad without a limit of toppings (unless you're at a salad bar.)"}
{"text":"First and last time here. My grilled cheese sandwich came with paper in it. Took it Back and was told \"oh sorry\" they just walked away and never gave me another sandwich or said one word. I had to go back to the register to ask for my money back and again just an \"oh sorry\".  I thought this may be a step up from Eat-n-park but I was clearly mistaken. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This might be super petty to write a review about this, but it has me super annoyed. I asked the young, short, dark haired girl who made my salad of she could put two more mozzarella balls on my salad. She said no, we are only supposed to put 4 to 5 on a salad. So I could ask for every different cheese on the salad, but I can't have 2 more mozzarella balls?? I've been in the restaurant business for 20 years... and I've learned that it's better to just appease the customer than to piss them off. Now, I've had a bad experience and will tell people about it. While I love the salads there... she put me in a crappy mood and I probably won't go back. After tipping them, I should have told them to use the 2 bucks I tipped them and charge me for extra mozzarella. Customer service there is mediocre at best with just the bare minimum done."}
{"text":"I loved his place! I was passing through Pittsburgh for work and was looking for a healthy option.  They have a great selection and some really interesting combinations. And you can build your own salads as well.  I had one of their burgers and it was perfect. The kale and salmon salad was amazing! Definitely will be back and recommend."}
{"text":"Helloooo my new favorite place!! Stopped by here for a quick lunch and didn't think I would be so happy and satisfied. I got the avocado veggie burger and i don't even remember chewing - it was so good i couldn't eat fast enough. The fries were a bit on the salty side but for $2 you get a lot of fries.   I really like this place and I want to try every burger (veggie) possible."}
{"text":"Erin S. - Just following up with you and Hello Bistro. Thanks for your response to my review. Although I got back to you immediately with the info you requested, 2 1/2 months later I still haven't heard anything further. Odd."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 has been here 4 times in the first few weeks and love it. Great addition to the south hills!"}
{"text":"A salad paradise. Unlimited options on the salad bar, and delicious sandwiches and fries. This is a salad I'd go way out of my way for. Good job Hello Bistro!"}
{"text":"How do you go to this place and not go for the salad? Well, I did. And I'm glad I did. Lots of protein for vegetarians & vegans... lentils, beans, hard boiled eggs, chick peas, nuts, tofu... you get the idea. Chopping up & mixing the salad was the healthy icing on this healthy cake. I enjoyed the Boylan Vintage Soda Pop, a nice refreshing change. I also checked out the kids menu, with more then one veggie option for my veggie kid (PB&J, grilled cheese and a little salad).  Beware, it does get jammed packed so stay away from peak hours. I will, for sure, be back."}
{"text":"Great concept and I have been to other locations that were 4 stars but this place needs work. I am 10 minutes into my wait for some salads \"to go\" and it looks like Keystone Cops Make Salads. One worker has now smelled the 3 differed to dressing bottles (gross) and returned them. How about you label the bottle?  One person seems to be assigned all 3 salads in my order so people are coming in, ordering, and leaving while I sit waiting."}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ burger to go. It's listed under the 'beefy burger' section, so I think it's reasonable to expect that I'd get a beef patty in my burger? Much to my surprise, the burger came with everything except meat. 0 stars for that. Definitely better to stick to the salads here. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I adore Hello Bistro. It's a great lunch spot. The servers are very friendly and the facilities are extremely clean.  They have a wide selection of add-ins and dressings.  My favorite is the Thai peanut dressing (sweet, but oh so tasty). Make sure that you tell the salad makers how heavy you want your dressing....If you do not clarify -- they go over board."}
{"text":"I had seen the Bistro while waking down Carson and wanted to try it. I brought my oldest son who is 22. Hello Bistro is owned by Eat N Park. Ear N Park restaurants are a long standing tradition in Pittsburgh. The menu offers burgers, a selection of grilled cheeses, and salads. I ordered the Superburger special-a Superburger, fries, and your choice of a fountain drink or a PBR. (The weirdest part of Hello Bistro is that they serve beer. They don't in their restaurants.). My son ordered a Buffalo Blue burger. Our meals came out on silver metal trays the size of old school frozen dinners. Our burgers were hot and juicy. The fries came in a paper bag. They were hot and salty. We both liked our meals. The only down side is that our table was not clean. Of course we bought Smiley cookies to munch on while we walked around Carson."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE business and customer service. Although you may be told differently by staff, NOT PET FRIENDLY!   My husband and I visited this location today as we were trying to find a pet friendly lunch spot to sit outside with our dog. We had first come across a different restaurant nearby and were on a 45 minute wait list. We decided to walk around the area to try to see if we could find another spot to be seated quicker - we stumbled upon Hello bistro. As we always do, I walked inside to ask the staff if we were permitted to sit on their outside patio and eat with our labradoodle prior to getting in line to order. The staff, so very friendly, were quick to tell me \"of course we do! and thanks for checking with us first\" I thought great! She then proceeded to tell me someone else has just called in to ask the same question! I went ahead and called the other restaurant and cancelled our spot in line.   I took a menu outside to look over with my husband since we were new to the place, and after a while of sitting on their patio we decided what to order. I went inside and waited in a long line to place my order. As I was getting ready to step up to place my order the manager comes up to me and tells me that she had just told my husband outside that we were not allowed to eat there with our dog. At this point, I of course was upset that I had waited in their long line, cancelled my reservation at another restaurant, and WAS TOLD BY THE STAFF we could eat there with our dog!!   As I work with the public, I tried to remain calm and explain to the manager the situation and how her staff told us we had permission. I had asked since I was getting ready to order if they could make this exception since we were informed incorrectly. The manager just simply responded its our policy and you can not eat here.   I will never support this business and will be sure to pass along my negative experience to others. I hope that the customer that called in to ask about their dog policy outside did not drive too far to get there. Hopefully others will at least see this review and then know what their true policy is before waisting their time at this place.  For anyone in this area looking for a pet friendly place - go to First Watch - excellent food and very accommodating staff!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.. Who would have thought you could eat so healthily in Pittsburgh... And that people would come in droves?"}
{"text":"Very filling and customizable salads! ...but overly priced and the service is terrible. I usually customize my own salad when I go and it always fills me up. The price is usually around $9-10, which is a lot for a salad. But their burgers and fries aren't too bad, in taste and in price. The service on the other hand is a completely different story. One time I came in about an hour to an hour and a half before they closed and no one was at the front of the house. There were people in the kitchen who made eye contact with me but didn't say anything to reassure my anxiety. I ended up standing there for about 15 mins to 20 mins before someone came to serve me. The service I received also was not very friendly, as he didn't apologize for my long wait. Even with a busy day or not, there was always a long enough wait that I would take note of. Would only come back if I was really craving a salad (which is very rare) or was coerced into going.  tldr; food 7/10 service 1.5/10 interior 9/10 (lots of seating)"}
{"text":"I love Hello Bistro!  Their salads are yummy with vastly different pre-created concoctions for those who have a hard time being creative in making their own salad.  The portions are HUGE. But not big enough to share because once you start eating it, you won't want to share, nor will you stop eating after being full. You will keep eating until it's all gone. At least, that been my case every-time I go.   Their $2 hand cut fries are a must! I almost want to say, they are my favorite fries next to in-n-out fries. Get some of their ranch dip and dip your fries. You will thank me ;)  Their burgers are really good too! Freshly made to order. So good!   For the calorie counters out there, there's a pdf nutrition guide online. Turns out one of my go-to salads is a gut bomb... Oh well... Thankfully there's about 3million different salads to make/choose from :)"}
{"text":"I like their salads (good quality ingredients, tasty dressing, generous portions), but they have got to do something about their long lines during lunchtime. It takes about 15-30 minutes to create your salad from start to finish. I recommend changing a step in the process in the assembly line to improve the process / make it more efficient. Perhaps by removing the chopping function to reduce wait time."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice, but the place is not so clean. My salad tasted okay but I think the tofu was already a bit older. There are nicer places around in downtown. This one is not my favorite."}
{"text":"Holy crap ok seriously this is the only place you should go to when your looking for a delicious salad. Don't get the pre-made ones on the menu!! Rip off the idea & create your own delicious salad masterpiece! Too good. Even if you're not salad obsessed like me you will definitely not be disappointed. Soo many toppings & amazing unique dressings. Get creative! I gave 4/5 stars Bc I wish they had a vegetarian or vegan Caesar dressing option. & PS open one up in New Jersey please!!"}
{"text":"I came here today for the Tandoori chicken salad. The other ingredients sounded good and are generally what I like. The neat thing they do is chop the greens into small pieces. That made it easy to eat AND it makes it possible for them to pack a lot of greens into the bowl. It took awhile to eat but wasn't a workout on the jaw since it was chopped. The other ingredients like the beets and avocado were great. There wasn't a lot of chicken but it seemed appropriate for lunch.  I enjoyed this selection a lot and will have it again.  The salad offerings are what make this place stand out to me. Whenever I want a salad for my meal, I will come here."}
{"text":"The food is OK, the experience could use some work. I come in every few months to give Hello Bistro's South Side location another chance, and am usually let down and then avoid Hello Bistro's South Side location for another few months until I forget about the whole thing. Their salads are hit-and-miss, so when you find something you like, stick with it!  The burgers are simple and creative, the grilled cheeses hit the spot, and the soups are a good alternative to fries or a side-salad. I came in with a birthday coupon (thanks!) and the staff that greeted me didn't seem too thrilled about any of it and it caused a bit more complication that it helped.  For fast-casual or for takeout, Hello Bistro is definitely a quick spot and easy decision. I'm just always left wanting a bit more."}
{"text":"A former boss once gave me the advice \"watch out for black ice and never eat anything bigger than your own head.\" If I had listened to him I would never know the joy of the Hello Bistro salad. A gigantic salad with toppings galore and the most scrumdiddlyumptious ranch dressing known to man. Really, it's a good 2-3 meal salad, at least! For the price ($7.95 w/o meat) you really can't do any better. They do charge extra for chicken, shrimp or salmon, but really there are a couple meat-ish like toppings (ham, bacon) available with the salad that you wouldn't have to pay the extra couple bucks if you didn't want. And the burgers and fries are good too. The good morning burger with the egg and bacon is killer. The fries especially are also Homer Simpson drool worthy, but I love fries, so that's nothing new. I always order on line and pick up, which means I am no help as far as service or anything goes. I will say this place is PACKED around lunch time so I would suggest trying the ordering on line thing as well. Plus, when you order the first time online you get $2.00 bucks off your order!!"}
{"text":"How many times can Eat n Park try another concept using the same old food?  If you are going to serve the same soup, burgers, and salad bar why not call it Eat n Park.  I understand that they are trying to open new outlets and different concepts, but it if you never change the ingredients why bother.  My wife and I stopped on our way to Target to pick up a few things.  She ordered the Caprese grilled cheese sandwich and fries.  After reviewing the menu and seeing all the speciality burgers I began to think that their burger must be something special. I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup, I love soup.  My burger came without any condiments, I had to go up to the counter to ask for mayo, and the burger tasted slightly better than the frozen ones you get from Costco.  Oh, and soup is the same chicken noodle you get at Eat n Park, which is not bad, but like I stated before if I wanted to eat at Eat n Park it's a five-minute drive down the street.     Do not be tricked, if you want  Eat n Park level food, go to an Eat n Park."}
{"text":"Excellent for what it is, a fast-casual burgers and salads spot. Always fast service, no judgement when you add 100 toppings to your salad. Boylan's Soda is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to South Side options. Their salads are big and the pre-made options are usually pretty tasty. The build your own salad option is like being at Eat'n'Park's salad bar with all the fixin's. I love burgers and fries, and these are good options.   They don't have wifi, but there's almost always ample seating available. During warm weather they also have outdoor tables and windows that open to the street for fresh air.   Good option for a quick pick up meal too."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great meal from this Hello Bistro. I ordered my food to go, and was only 3 minutes away when I ate it. The veggie burger was very mushy, possibly undercooked. The fries were done, but soggy and soaked with grease. I don't think I'll return here. I'm used to Hello Bistro having very fresh ingredients and the fries are always crispy. This was disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this place for the past few days. I enjoy that I can make different salads each time I go.   Plenty of toppings and dressings to choose from, and  enough salad for 2 meals."}
{"text":"Was once a great place to get a salad.  Not so much anymore.  Maybe I should have made my own salad, but I thought it was quicker to have one ordered off the menu.  I ordered A Tandoori Salad Story.  So let me tell you my story ...  - Took close to 20 minutes to get my salad.  Almost got a parking ticket waiting.  - It's almost 100% Kale.  Almost no chicken whatsoever.  Dressing was overwhelming.  - What chicken that was in salad was under-cooked.    - Not worth it.  Expensive and almost ALL Kale. No chicken, no spinach, ...  Just Kale and dressing.  Not sure why it took them so long to prepare.  Much better salads elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge salad bar. Fresh food to eat in and to go. Vegetarian's rescue in otherwise not too vegetarian neighborhood. Quick service. If you just want to grab a quick bite at a reasonable price this is the place to go. Note: their salad servigs are huge! Ask for a \"to go\" box and you probably have enough for a light dinner."}
{"text":"Perfect EVERY single time!!!! This is my go-to for lunch in the middle of work, and they never disappoint me!!! The friendly workers keep me coming back every time! MAMA LISA IS MY FAVE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of Hello Bistro, and I was thrilled when I found out I would have time to head over for the trendy restaurant's first day.  As I walked in, I was blown away by the hipness and modernness of the decor.  The front facade has giant garage windows that open up to the outside on a bright, sunny day like the opening happened to be.  The manager greeted us with menus and a smiling face as we proceeded to gaze over the vast variety of FREE endless toppings.  The worker kindly helped me build my salad and told me what some of the unknown items were that I was gazing over.  After successfully building my ginormous salad, I decided on Citrus Lime Vinaigrette, which was one of the many dressing they have to offer.  The way they prepared the salads and then chop them up right in front of you really creates an intimate experience.  On a side note, the fountain drinks are Boylan Vintage Sodas, and they are extremely delicious!  My salad was all that I hoped it to be.  I cannot believe I received a huge shrimp salad with as many toppings as I wanted including a variety of cheese for all $9.00.  Not to mention, I finished my meal up with a yummy milkshake that made my stomach very happy.  I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE HELLO BISTRO.  There are so many options to add to my salad (i.e. EVERYTHING)! Compared to all the other restaurants in Oakland, not counting when things are half off, Hello Bistro is where I'll go for ~$8.  P.s. bacon doesn't count as meat."}
{"text":"The Chipotle for salads. A rare healthy option in a college town."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Hello Bistro for lunch while running errands on a Saturday afternoon. Since it was prime lunch time they were pretty busy. We didn't have to wait in line to order but we did have to wait for someone to finish eating so we could grab their table.  My husband got the super value burger with fries and I got the BBQ chicken salad. We really enjoyed both of our meals and my only call out was that my salad was a little heavy on the lime. Also, their fountain soda is to die for! It's a vintage soda brand that you must try!!! We are definitely looking forward to going back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, the salads look amazing.  I wouldn't know because in the middle of South Side Salad Mecca, I ordered a burger.  Not just any burger, though.  While the patty was a traditional Eat n Park patty, the toppings made the Mean Green Avocado Burger the orgasmic experience that it was.  Maybe I'm overreacting a little, but it really was delicious: creamy avocado slices, crisp red onions, a tangy \"secret sauce,\" and thick Swiss cheese on a pillowy-soft brioche bun.  I'll get around to trying salads one of these days, but I need to work my way through the burger and sandwich menu first!"}
{"text":"Cool place for lunch! You order whatever you want in your salad, which is huge by the way, and they chop it up all together in small/medium/large pieces (you get to choose). Decent prices and friendly service. They offer a lot of options to make your salad great. They also have sandwich and veggie burger options for the salad haters of the world. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would definitely go to Hello Bistro frequently."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here! Always consistently delicious salads with a friendly and efficient staff, especially during the crazy lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"Its definitely a great place to grab a salad or even a quite good burger. But, its amazingly organized during their busy time.   Unfotunately, If you order from their menu it might take much much longer than actually picking up your ingredients."}
{"text":"The food here is good IF they get your order right - which happens about 1/2 the time.  Also, there must be some issue with the online ordering because whether the place is crowded or empty, orders are never ready at the time they tell you to arrive.  Lastly, if you come after 2 or 3 PM for an online order, you can't go to the 'Pick-Up' register. But, no one will tell you that. They just let me keep standing there without acknowledging me let alone actually helping me **If this place was managed better, it could be really great. But, I've been burned so many times that I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I'm really excited about Hello Bistro. I was heading to pinball with my boyfriend and our good friend, and he showed us Hello Bistro. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the options, but I went with a veggie burger and fries. My boyfriend got one of their salads.   The salad process is probably the most notable and unique part of Hello Bistro. There are tons of choices for your salad starting with a variety of healthy greens. There's just about every veggie you could hope for, a lot of nuts and seeds and a variety of cheese toppings. The dressings are yummy too - he chose chipotle lime vinaigrette. All of the ingredients looked fresh and recently prepped. That's a plus, since it's easy to let those items sit out all day.   My veggie burger was large and filling. It tasted phenomenal, too. The crispy fries were skinny and flavorful. The order of fries is large enough to share between two or three people depending on how much of a fry monger you are.   One of my favorite parts of Hello Bistro is probably the fountain sodas. They're real sodas without icky chemicals. Creme soda and birch beer soda from a fountain? Dream come true. I mixed the creme soda and ginger ale together for a really tasty combination. They aren't anymore expensive than your average fountain drink, either.   Hello Bistro is my new obsession. I'm pretty excited to go back, and I think next time I'll get one of those salads. The only downside is that it is kind of pricey for what you get. Two sodas, a salad, a veggie burger and fries ran us about $30. For \"fast\" food, it's a bit steep. Though, the quality and customer service really outweighs any negatives here."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is a new chain by the folks behind Eat N Park. It offers bistro-style food with a healthier twist than what you would find at a lot of places. I really love this place for a lot of reasons.  The first reasons is their extensive salad bar. You basically order a salad ($7.50 without protein), and then you can tell them all of the toppings you want - everything from roasted chickpeas to eggs, edamame and blue cheese. Protein toppings include pork, chicken, steak and tofu. Their dressings are interesting and full of flavor. My favorite is the pesto vinaigrette. I typically get a salad with romaine, mushrooms, egg, edamame, blue cheese, almonds, cranberries and the pesto dressing.   Their grilled cheeses and sandwiches are also rather inventive. I like their veggie burger, but last time I went I ordered the 2-alarm burger with a veggie patty sub, and it wasn't that exciting. Maybe I wasn't in the mood. It's usually fantastic.   Their fries come in a massive portion for $2, and they are my favorite part of Hello Bistro. I can't help it, I'm a potato junkie. They're skinny and crispy and just full of yum!   The natural-soda fountain is also fantastic. I usually try one of each, but birch beer is my favorite. Their cream soda is also fabulous when you mix it with the orange soda. Yummy!   Their current milkshake special is a strawberry-mango milkshake. It was to die for.   Hello Bistro staff is always friendly and helpful. I love the environment, I love the food. I am excited about this place, and I hope it continues to grow!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and made a special trip to the Southside location for lunch with my sister. I have been to the Oakland location and enjoyed the entire experience- food and customer service- so I was looking forward to lunch. My actual meal was fine (American Grill burger and fries). It was the customer service that left much to be desired. My sister ordered a custom salad. She had an important phone call come through and asked me to finish her order. The girl making the salad (Caitlin) was extremely unfriendly. Rudely asking \"what else\" and acting annoyed when I had to think about it (mind you - the place was NOT busy at all so it's not like I was holding up a line). When we came to the end of the line, she plopped the salad down and just stared at me. When I asked what else she needed to know she said \"I have more questions for her\" and just stared at my sister who had stepped aside. I responded that I knew what to order. She made no eye contact, finished the salad, and plopped it on the counter for me to take. No \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" or anything. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you're going to this location, I would recommend ordering online. My husband and i spent about 15 minutes after we paid waiting for someone to make our salads. The staff seems pretty new, and disorganized. As far as the salads, my husband got the Cobb Salad and I made my own.. both were good. You have to prompt if you would like a little more of the toppings because it is A LOT of lettuce and very small toppings.. especially if you only ask for a few different ones. Overall, it's a good place to get a salad that you customize but don't go here if you're looking for the best salad you've ever had."}
{"text":"I want to like hello bistro and I've given it numerous chances. I've been to different locations, and all are the same. My coworkers and i stopped going to this location for a while due to the slow service and decided to try it again today. Nothing has changed and it may have gotten worse. The service was extremely slow, so much that my coworker and I waited 20 minutes (at least) after we paid to even have our salads made. To top it off, I ordered a salad from the menu (buffalo chicken), and it was less than okay. The amount of chicken put into the salad was barely anything, and I looked away for 2 seconds only to find out when I got back to eat my salad at the office that tomatoes were added. My receipt clearly said no tomato. I paid 9+ dollars for extremely slow service, barely any chicken, and realizing my order was incorrect after getting back to eat it. I had waited for so long it wasn't even worth going back to let the employees know. It appears there is no system happening here, and not even one apology for the slow service. In fact, everyone seemed pretty unhappy. I don't think I'll be going back for a while, but I've given it many chances."}
{"text":"I have written to them multiple times they don't fix anything so maybe some constant public social shaming will do the trick, watch for my Foursquare, Facebook, Twitter, and Google reviews coming soon. This time I ordered a made to order the salad, with fries, I said LIGHT ranch, and add medium hot sauce in the comments. They gave me a small side of hot sauce in a cup not mixed in the salad. Like I said I ordered the salad with fries, left a comment please chop fries into the salad...Nope, COLD fries in a bag. Every time I go there it gets worse, and smells more and more like a garbage dumpster."}
{"text":"This is another of the \"build your own\" upscale fast food spots that are great for quick meals. They have a ton of veggie and topping options for salad so you can create your own masterpiece. They also have several dressing options and I love the fact that they ask you how much dressing you want and what size you want your salad chopped. The portion size is quite large, so it definitely a salad as a meal, especially with a protein added. People behind the counter were friendly and helpful while I made decisions. It was a late afternoon, but the place was still pretty hopping and everything moved along quickly. It looked like they also had some pretty good burgers and hand cut fries, but we were in a salad mood. My only complaint it that the dining area was not really clean. This happens in this type of spot because no one gets out from behind the counter to wipe off tables."}
{"text":"I went back to Hello Bistro today and the difference was night and day.  I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the Hello Bistro burger is the best burger I've had in Oakland.  The bun was nicely toasted lightly brushed with butter.  The burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The lettuce was fresh and crispy and the tomatoes were fresh as well.  It was NOT sloppy at all this time and came to my table looking like a burger from an advertisement.  The Boylan's soda fountain is still awesome .....don't ever get rid of it."}
{"text":"This location is always slow filling orders. I attempted to order chicken noodle soup at 7pm and was told they're completely out of every soup. Their hours at 10am - 10pm. I don't see any reason why they should be out of soup with 3 hours of operation left."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Understaffed. Took 20 minutes to get a salad.  When we arrived there was one person in front of us and yet they continued to take several orders after us only to make everyone wait.  Need larger staff."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place because I'm not Eat N Park's biggest fan, but the Partner In Cuisine and I were pleasantly surprised when we decided to saunter down to the Hello Bistro one warm Summer evening.  I usually try to avoid making lists like these, but rather than write 5 paragraphs, I thought I'd give you the breakdown.    Good:  Fresh ingredients.  You can get any salad combination you can think of.  Eat there every day and you never have to eat the same thing twice.  Boylan Soda on fountan!  All you can drink!  Yes, you read me correctly.  Not Pepsi...Not Coke.  Boylan.  Amazing.  The fries are a little soggy, but overall tasty.  Friendly staff (so far anyway - the place is too new for the employees to become jaded and miserable yet).  They actually serve beer and wine - that's nice, but I'm not sure that it was necessary.  The chalkboard wall is a fun concept.  Not so good:  Cold proteins.  Some people like chilled chicken and other meats on their salads so this might not be as much of an issue, but I prefer my chicken to be warmed up so it will melt the cheese just slightly.  The lunch rush is CRAZY and school hasn't even started yet.  I'd hate to see how busy this place will get on a weekday afternoon once the college kids return.   Final verdict:  The PIC and I will definitely be back for an early dinner perhaps, but we will definitely avoid lunching there on weekdays."}
{"text":"A health nut's oasis in the Southside, but still enough choices outside the salad bar to please anyone. I love how you can customize every part of your order - the lettuce, toppings, dressing, even down to the bite size and most of all that you don't have to weigh it by the end.   I could honestly eat here everyday and never get tired of it. Every time I go, they have new salad bar additions - kale/spinach mix, wheat berries, asparagus, etc - that shows the owners really like to keep innovative. I'm sure if this were in a more health conscious city (that doesn't put fries on everything) this place would be booming, similar to Sweet Green. But they will always have my loyalty!"}
{"text":"The first time I walked in Hello Bistro I was so overwhelmed by the salad options that I ordered a turkey burger (Which was great by the way).  Ever since that first visit,  they've been consistent with the quality and customer service. The ingredients are great and every time is just as great as the first time. My only complaint is that the salad portion size is ridiculous. I don't go unless I feel I can consume such a huge amount of salad."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time today and ordered the the Tandoor Chicken Salad. It has two items I hate, beets and kale. But surprisingly it tasted excellent, so Hello Bistro gets full marks on that. I also walked in literally two minutes before a line started forming, so I avoided the dreaded line. I liked the menu options and salad bar for those building their own salads is displayed well,  albeit no labeling. The reason for knocking off a point however is, in my very last bite I either bit in to a stone or a raw grain. That was highly unpleasant."}
{"text":"The best salad I have had in a loooonnnggg time!   Another Hello Bistro and in a great spot downtown. You can build your own salad or pick one of the many on the menu.  I opted for the Caribbean Shrimp Salad that had lots of fresh greens, some marinated shrimp, avocado, black beans, corn, tortilla strips that added a nice crunch and a very good citrus lime vinaigrette.   Don't forget the fresh cut french fries.  Oh So Good! Some great Boylan's Red Root Beer, too."}
{"text":"Great French fries! Apple chicken salad was so good! Turkey burger was good too. Plus Boylan soda."}
{"text":"Hello! was the friendly greeting as we entered.  Here's how this works:  you pick up a menu as you walk in the door, you can order a salad or burger on the menu or create your own.  There are over 50 salad toppings.  So much to chose from!  The salad is huge!  My partner in eating ordered one of the specialty salads.  You then watch them mix the salad and cut/chop the mixed greens; your choice of small, medium or large chunks.  Then they add the dressing of your choice.    Or you can get a Flippin burger.   With the burger order they give you a number to set on the table you select and when complete, the kitchen brings it to you.  Delicious burger (had the Over-Easy, Burger + Cheddar Cheese + Bacon + Over-Easy Egg = That's All Yolks!} and good fries!  Love the Boylan's Vintage Soda Pop machine, too!     HB has a few beers and wines available.    HB does have a few grille Sam'iches, Soup and Breakfast."}
{"text":"After biking we stopped in for a fresh salad and fresh ice tea.  Hard to not get some of the Boylan vintage soda but I resisted.  The Strawberry Fields salad was so refreshing and tasty.  A great stop after biking."}
{"text":"Order for lunch today, the burger was ok, a bit undercooked, but still edible.  My side salad however was absolutely disgusting! It look as if it has been siting for a week in the container. The Lettuce is mostly brown and sitting in an inch of what I would describe as \"lettuce juice\" very wilted and soaked through by the juice. I didn't even open it. Extremely disappointed and disgusted. I will not try this place again. I posted 2 pictures of what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"As I usually make a weekly trip to Pittsburgh, I am always on the look out for somewhere new to eat. This is always on my list of options.   I absolutely love their \"Salads By You\". All the toppings you want for one price (minus some extras). The ingredients are always fresh and the staff is always happy and willing to help you if you have any questions or concerns.   The burgers are ok, nothing special (just your typical E'nP burger). Though, I really do enjoy the Mean Gran Avocado Turkey Burger. There's just something about the turkey burger, brioche bun, avocado and swiss cheese that do it for me.  Service is usually good, even during the lunch rush. They are usually pleasant and willing to help you with anything you need."}
{"text":"Very casual.  Open air seating when weather is nice.  Order and pay, then the staff delivers your meal.  For us, one item was missing from the order so it was misunderstood when placing the order.  Not a big deal for us.  Salads can be ordered with choice of toppings.  Chicken soup was good and hot."}
{"text":"We were dying for salads, and Hello Bistro did not disappoint! They have the best selection of toppings, and they never weigh your salad or tell you \"no.\" They've got the good ones like green and black olives and artichokes and plenty of fresh fruit. The salad selecting, chopping, and mixing process is really fun... and makes a darn tasty salad!  Also, consider having your salad \"finely chopped.\" Every bite is packed with delicious flavor with no enormous pieces of lettuce to fight.   The fries are great!  Plus, I love the fountain full of Boylan soda! Mmmmm! Hello, Black Cherry!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, about an hour before closing time. The service has been very good, but each time the tables were already being set up for close with chairs being put on tables. I feel lik that's a bit early and it discourages one from eating there. This is my lunch time at work and it would be nice if I could get out of work and eat there without feeling like a nuisance.   The food is great. I've never had a bad salad and i will always love Eat'n Park's chicken noodle soup. My favorite salad is the apple, almond, chicken salad. It's a little pricey but it's nice to have a healthy and quick option while working the 3-11pm shift so I justify it. I'll definitely be back and I would say this location compares to the Oakland location without all the students."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a spur of the moment lunch and I'm so happy we did !!! I chose to make my own salad and it was nice seeing them make it right in front of you.  I also loved the fact that you see how fresh all the salad options are, and there's just sooo many you can possibly think of !!! It was sooo good and I can't wait to go back for another healthy, clean, fresh salad :)"}
{"text":"I only wish that there was a Hello Bistro in my neighborhood. I only had a salad but it was terrific fresh and huge. It could have easily fed two people big you like salad stop by because you will truly enjoy what they hBe to offer. Either pick from their pre designed salads or design your own. Really great."}
{"text":"You can make your own salad or pick one of there's!  They have many different ingredients to add.   They also have sandwiches and soup.   Outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I have been coming here probably for the past three years. Whenever I feel like I am not eating enough vegetables, I make sure to go to Hello Bistro. I always do the create your own salad, because then you can get as many as toppings as you want. Recently, I have been getting fruity salads, with mandarin oranges, apples, strawberries, edamame, quinoa, bell peppers, red onions, cucumbers, broccoli, avocado, chicken, almonds, pumpkin seeds, with citrus lime vinaigrette. I usually just try to make sure to have a theme in mind because the amount of toppings can be overwhelming.   Also, they give you a free salad for your birthday which is great!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay, it's past time for a review for Hello Bistro.  I love this place.  It's a great spot for some serious salad goodness.  I love that you can order on line and your order is ready when you arrive.  I love that they throw me an occasional coupon that makes me feel good about myself.  I love the tiny little Smiley cookies.  And I love that they also have meaty sandwiches and delicious burgers for my bf.  I only wish there were more soup choices.  Such a good place to eat!!"}
{"text":"HELLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BISTRO!  This place is one of my go-to places when I'm hungry.  I absolutely love it and find myself craving it constantly.  Sometimes you just really want a salad and Hello Bistro is there to save your day!  So, for $9 you get all the fixins including gourmet toppings like avocado!  The proteins they offer also cater to vegans and vegetarians in that they offer tofu!  I love that they offer dried cranberries and toasted walnuts.  What's also great is you can switch up the salad every time you come here.  They have lots of different dressings and you can sample all of them to see which one you like.  The salad is REALLY filling but if you have room I do suggest ordering the fries.  They're pretty darn delicious but after the one time I ordered fries and a salad I learned the hard way that I can only have room for the one or the other - and the salad wins!  Seriously, check it out!  You can make your salad as crazy or simple as you like it.   Hard to believe this place is owned by Eat n Park.  Oh, and they serve beer and wine!"}
{"text":"This is my second time trying Hello Bistro and I won't be back.  I decided to opt for a burger and a side of chili.  The bun of the burger was so saturated with butter that it fell apart upon attempting to take a bite.  The greens on the burger looked like they had seen better days.  I suspect they take salad product that's past its prime and use that in the back kitchen to make the sandwiches etc to cut costs. Last time I came here the chili was really good.  This time not so much.  It was more a soupy bowl of beans than anything deserving of the title chili.  I would suggest sticking with the salad options.  Meh."}
{"text":"I have been to the other 4 locations, and was so excited when this one opened on Monday because it's close to work for me.  When I walked in, it wasn't too busy, probably because it had just opened and not many people know about it yet. I got a kale and spinach salad and loaded up with veggies. The Apple Cider Vinaigrette is delicious.   The service is fast, the prices are great, and it's very clean. Also, the employees working: from outside, the register, and down the salad line were all super friendly. There is plenty of seating inside.  I will be back to this location for a healthy and delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"The salads here are wonderful so long as you customize your own. Don't EVER order a pre-made salad from here. You have no option as to if you'd like the dressing on the side or how you would like it chopped.  Also, SOME not ALL of the workers here are not on point. They're starting to get slow. From the time you place your order to the time you're handed your salad takes about 10-15 minutes for just a salad! God forbid you come here during the lunch rush... I hope you plan to make up the extra lunch time you wasted in line here."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad off the menu, to go. I waited 30 minutes and finally asked about my order. They said they lost it. I waited another 15 before they brought it. They made the salad wrong. I paid for avocado and did not get any. Mostly angry about the wrong order after such a long wait."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of Hello Bistro and the location is great. I stopped by for dinner on the late side - around 8pm - and it was pretty much empty. I was hungry so I settled on the Bistro burger and shared some fries. The burger was a bit too well done for me (I do like a little pink) but the fries - yes!! Fantastic and then you dip them into the ranch sauce."}
{"text":"I've been here several times looking for a healthy and quick meal. Hello Bistro has always delivered. The option to customize your own salad is awesome, while their menu salads are unique and take the hassle out of having to decided among 55 salad toppings. My usual is the Caribbean Shrimp at $9.50 it consists of  Mixed Greens + Seasoned & Roasted Shrimp + Avocado + Black Beans + Corn + Tortilla Strips with Citrus Lime Vinaigrette very filling and refreshing. I recently took advantage of their online ordering feature and it was an easy and I liked that I could opt to pay cash upon pick up! I've been to both the Oakland and South Side locations prefer South Side, way better seating. And I LOVE that they have birch beer fountains drinks, takes me back!"}
{"text":"Great place! I was greeted at the door and the staff was super friendly. I did a create your own salad and they give you a lot and then chop it up at the end and ask if you want small medium or large bites, I love a salad that's chopped tiny so I loved that! Dominique made my salad and she was so nice and upbeat! As far as allergies go, it seemed some of the staff was knowledgeable and others weren't. When it comes down to it, they were helpful and gave me a gluten free dairy free salad, and chopped it on an allergy tray. They also didn't seem annoyed by my allergies like a lot of places, but communication between the staff could have been better. I would recommend for a salad place with gluten free options to also make what is gluten free and what isn't on the create your own menu. I was informed the fiesta chicken is not and the tandoori chicken is marinated in yogurt. That can be misleading to anyone with allergies, and I wouldn't have known if I didn't ask. Overall I recommend this place and will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and selected additions to my burger which were an up-charge but I did not receive them. On top of that the turkey burger was over cooked and chewy. Fries were very greasy and mushy. Not a great first experience."}
{"text":"! What's not to love? They have MTO salads, delicious, Juicy Burgers, hand-dipped milkshakes, Pepsi products, and green iced tea (which is hard to find).  The GM, Andy, came right over to grret us, shake our hands, and give us a $10 gift card for a future visit. My Hawaii Five-O turkey burger was delicious. It was juicy, plump, perfectly cooked and Anna I'm a delicious fun with a fresh slice of pineapple and melted cheese. French fries, which I did not order, we're $2 extra."}
{"text":"Went with family around 7:30 for dinner. When we walked in the eating area was filthy dirty. The food food prep area was even worse salad all over floor and counter tops just a pig pen. This place will not last unless they get someone in there that can actually run a fast casual restaurant. We didn't even order just left."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  The employees are deliberately slow and rude. They are always talking to each other instead of taking orders or performing whatever tasks they need to do.   It took me 23 minutes to get a simple burger and fries (which were ok at best). Burger was awful, the brioche bun wasn't buttered or toasted, it had way too much lettuce on it, the bacon was limp, the onions weren't caramelizad and the patty was somehow both overcooked and cold at the same time. The fries had way too much pepper on them and some were crispy while others were practically raw.   Not spending my money here again until I see some change, last time I came here the bacon on my grilled cheese was dangerously undercooked.   This place used to be good I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is Eat n Park's entry into what they call \"fast casual\" food concept. The menu consists of 3 main items-salads, burgers, and cheese. You can have your salad made to order or choose one of their prepared salads or one of their seasonal specials. I noticed the strawberry salad bears a strong resemblance to the same one currently at Eat n Park. I was told of some subtle differences that this salad has and the regular Eat n Park doesn't.  They have a variety of different hamburgers including the famous superburger that the Eat n Park chain has. There is a limited selection of cheese for sandwiches. My husband decided to order the superburger with fries. He was given a number so that it could be brought out to him. I decided to try the build your own salad. You pay upfront for this first before they pull the items to build your salad. Certain items are extra such as chicken, shrimp, and avocado. You start by picking the base greens and then you get an unlimited choice of various toppings. You tell them what you want and they will pull your selections into your prep bowl. They did have items such as quinoa as a topping which I thought was different. I like quinoa but it gets mixed in the salad along with everything else.  Then they will mix it up and serve it to you in a huge plastic bowl similar to what you would get at Brugger's bagels.  I chose as my base kale and spinach and had them add a fair amount of my favorite vegetables, The chicken was prepared different ways so you could choose the time you wanted. I went with that. I saw that they had green ice tea available in addition to peach ice tea. If you want a lemon however, then you must ask for it while you are waiting for your salad to be prepared. They also will ask you how much or how little dressing of your choice you want before mixing it all together.  I finally got my finished salad and went back to join my husband. He told me his superburger tasted a bit greasy. The fries come bagged even though we had decided to eat in. I tasted a couple and again nothing particularly outstanding about it. My salad was fair as well. My kale was crunchy and there was a lot of it!  The manager Andy came over to chat with us and I got the opportunity to learn how their concept works. They do offer some farm to table items and compared to Eat n Park's famous salad bar, they offer more here. On the contrary however, when you go to Eat n Park and order the salad bar, if you don't like what is on it then you can get a fresh plate and start again. He also explained that the fries always come bagged since their concept is fast casual.  I did ask about some of the pastries I found on the bar since all they were selling here were mini smiley cookies. He explained to me that since they don't have a bakery they can't carry the same mini bear claws or muffins I normally find over there. They will be carrying soups like tomato and chicken noodle in the fall. Don't look for chili. It is not a popular item here.  I did get the opportunity afterwards to talk a little with the chef and learn how some of the food is prepared. The place was fairly packed by the time we left. Outdoor seating is available. They are just a little more expensive than Eat n Park. They will be opening up another Hello Bistro on Washington Road in Mt. Lebanon in the near future.  The eatery is located right in the center of the upper part of the new strip mall off of Siena Dr and right around the corner from the Porch at Siena. It is a different concept having them prepare it for me. Nevertheless, I probably will return to the regular Eat n Park for their soup and salad bar where I can make it up any way I choose for a bit less money."}
{"text":"Always love being back in Pittsburgh and having lunch here!! This is how you salad, I just don't see any other way to do it!"}
{"text":"If you have two hours to burn, this is the place to get a killer salad. Otherwise, it would be faster to  go to the grocery store in a neighboring county, get the ingredients and make it yourself. The place itself is huge (and clean!) but it's just not staffed appropriately for a downtown lunch rush. The order ahead option online is amazing, but here's my experience: 11:20am: order salad 12:26pm: time the salad is said to be ready 12:48pm: the actual time my salad was ready  An hour and a half to toss a standard salad off the menu? Why? I learned that only two people were staffed to accommodate all the to go orders.  If you don't order ahead and are brave enough to wait in line between 12-1pm, peace be with you."}
{"text":"I tried this place again after previously giving up on them over a year ago, as I needed something quick while in that area.  I should have kept to original plan to avoid them.  I ordered a salad.  The salad maker takes a plastic bowl & asks what type of greens I wanted, so I pointed to one tub that had a mixture of Spring Mix & Iceberg (I prefer 100% Spring Mix, but they still don't offer that).  I told her to take some out so there'd be space for other things. And truth be told - there's a nice selection of some decent items to add in - it's just that they try to be so stingy with these things as though they were putting diamonds in there.  There is all manner of typical raw salad vegetables, cheeses, grilled vegetables, \"crunchies\" (as they called them), dressings (not stingy with that), and protein (the one add-in that costs extra).  I selected shrimp & the portion was an itty-bitty scoop that cost $3 - a very shrimpy portion of shrimp.  After it was all together, they offered to chop it.    The salad is fine.  I thought it's vastly over-priced, especially the shrimp add-in."}
{"text":"We did an online order for pickup. I got the California Scrambler sandwich and my husband got the Superburger combo and they forgot the fries, this is the second time now. Luckily we checked before we left this time. The bread on my sandwich was so burnt it was black! Why would you serve that to someone??"}
{"text":"The salads look better than the sandwiches my friend and I ordered. It's not bad, but I seriously don't understand why it's so crowded around lunch time when there are plenty of better sandwich places nearby. Get a salad if you go here."}
{"text":"I was so glad when the Oakland location opened a few years ago. I always make my own salad- great, unlimited toppings (proteins are extra though) and they've expanded to offer kale and spinach as well. Love their Parmesan peppercorn dressing! Beware of long lines (as expected) during weekday lunchtime, and there's a range in service-- some staff are friendly and efficient, others not so much."}
{"text":"I will say walking in the door was not impressive.  The atmosphere seemed bland and unexciting.  The cashier looks to hate his job, and like we were a bother.  First impressions are ever lasting.  I figured this would be a disaster.  As we sat waiting for our food I watched one employee work and serve a customer salad, the cashier sit on his phone, and the chef work magic.  Maybe it was just slow or not the high point of the day.  Anyway, we ordered mushroom and onion jack with 3 grain veggie burger, and mean green avocado with 3 grain veggie burger.  They were awesome.  Price is average for a meal, this is just a burger, but fries come separate at a $2 charge.  So I will say its worth the quickness but not the whole package.  At least offer a few fries, potato salad, or at least carrots on the side.  Make the display a bit more appealing.  I gave three stars for the taste and flavor.  Service would have been a 2, he did not even try to upsell me on a drink or fries. The display a 2.  So if you are in the area and want a quick small bite its here.  I will come again to see if its just a bad day."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro, you minx, you. Always serving up scrum-diddly-umptiousness. I've been here twice before and had good experiences both times. I've had their cauliflower and broccoli grilled cheese and the Caribbean shrimp salad; both solid choices. I would love to do a milkshake here sometime. I think HB is right up there with other really good chains like Shake Shack (even though SS only has burgers). I can't cheat on Shake Shack though, they are my fav. Anyhow, this is one of the only places in Pittsburgh where you can get a freshly made salad. Kinda sad, for sure....but a dependable and honest win!"}
{"text":"Should change the name to hellno bistro called ahead to place an order was put on hold after only being on hold then moone picked the phone back up then they served me a bullshit sandwich with no meat on it with soup with no noodles"}
{"text":"I was eagerly awaiting the opening of this location. I've frequented the South Side location so many times and was so pumped when a North Hills location was announced.   Ok, bottom line is I love this place...however; I was a little disappointed in the amount of toppings they put on my salad. I had the build-your-own salad and sure, I could have asked them to put more of whatever I wanted, but they were super skimpy. My experiences in other locations came with bountiful salads full of all the fixins. I think if I'm paying $11 for a salad, you better load that thing full of all the roasted beets, quinoa, and cucumbers you can stuff in it!   A lady who appeared to be the manager was friendly and running hot food to tables. Nice touch to the usual stand-and-watch managers usually encountered.   I'll definitely go back so here's you're heads up to make sure you stop skimping on those toppings!"}
{"text":"I was shocked when I found out Eat N Park owned this place.  Sandwiches were very good.  The fountain drinks were a great selection of local stuff.  The salad prep area looks great and I cant wait to go back and get a tossed salad done my way."}
{"text":"Two words: UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. Be still, my beating heart!   Hello Bistro makes my attempts at eating healthier a little less painful....just a little bit. This place is heaven for veg heads like me. Pile on as many fruit, veggies, and crunchies as you wish, don't be shy. If your salad is not mostly toppings, you're doing it wrong. I've been to this location several times, and they've never run out of anything I wanted. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious, plus the variety is insane. Salads aren't your thing? No problem! There's a whole menu of burgers, sandwiches, soups, and their freakin' awesome fries. Dip them in the E'nP ranch. So addictive!   Although the lines can get long during the lunch rush, the employees keep everyone moving at a very good pace. Previous reviews have mentioned that the restaurant can get dirty or smelly, but I've personally never had any complaints about the cleanliness. Just good timing, perhaps?"}
{"text":"Five stars for the burgers and salads, and for the fact that it's one of the few places you can actually get a healthy salad in Oakland.  But my god, don't bother having the online ordering if the pickup times are so wildly wrong. I get it's not the fault of the staff, it's the fault of whomever is managing and setting up the workflow. When you have online ordering in a very busy place not having people only working on the online orders defeats the purpose entirely. The last three times I've been the wait times have ended up being 35, 30, and 40 minutes. If it's going to be that long fine, figure out a way to work it into your online ordering system, get Eat n Park to pony up and join grubhub or eatstreet that can give actual estimates instead of always saying 20 minutes.   It won't stop me from eating here, but I'm sure it's going to stop people who aren't lucky enough to work across the street and have actual time crunches on their lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Oh Eat 'n Park you clever devil, you. I've been a fan of the company's HB chain since they began opening all over the area a couple of years back. Elaine from Seinfeld can take her big salad and keep moving. These salads are big...and fresh. I love the bowls and lids to go. Seriously I do. However I love what's in the bowls even more. You can choose from custom made salads or an array of salads on the menu. You can mix up their salads however you like. These are the most glorious of salad bars...behold!"}
{"text":"Nothing to get too excited over but the food tasted good, the lady behind the counter was awesome, and the atmosphere is very modern and clean! I came here for lunch and got the Italiano grilled cheese and fries, the fries had a tasty seasoning on them and the sandwich was just enough. Next time, i would like to get a salad! There are so many options to put on it. Worth a quick stop for lunch, just a little bummed that they don't have milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Delicious make your own salads! Delicious fries! Great value! Giant portions! You'll probably have leftovers lol they have classic sodas on fountain which was really unique. I liked that I could take picky friends there and they would still be happy with the offerings. Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, interesting fries (a bit too salty but delicious) and really good sodas! My friends have come here a few times now and it's definitely one of our usual dinner locations now.  Today, I had to suffer through a really long wait for my food, which is unusual. Everyone had gotten their food but me, even though I ordered before some of them. Just as I started getting frustrated, a server ran over to me and refunded my order to apologize for the wait. That sort of courtesy gets my 5 stars!  Edit: This was posted way after this was actually written. Written appx early October."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is only about 10 years behind the \"create your own salad\" grab and go places, but leave it to Eat n' Park to perfect it in the city!  It's pure chaos in here!  Slightly organized chaos, but chaos none-the-less.  It's not the well oiled machine I imagine it will be, but I think that's why they opened up during the summer \"off\" months when Pitt's not in session.  I think the work crowd is a good test though, because it was still packed around 1:15pm.    I ordered the Caribbean Shrimp which had mixed Greens, shrimp, avocado, black beans, corn, tortilla strips with citrus lime vinaigrette dressing.  I loved that you can get it chopped up into smaller pieces, they'll toss it in a big bowl with the dressing.  My godsend, they ask you if you want heavy dressing!!!  Yes, please!!!  It was a great salad and far from boring.  The dressing really made the salad, that and the ample amount of ingredients.     The real clincher was the, wait for it, BOYLAN SODA MACHINE!!!!!!!!  Dear God I love Boylan Cream Soda!  I had to stop myself from going up 10x.  Completely unique and a fantastic addition to an already stand out place.    I joked to my friend I probably won't be back until next summer since it will most definitely be jam packed with students once schools in session.  But maybe I can squeeze in a little visit during fall break.  I don't think I can wait that long to come back!"}
{"text":"It's the Boylan's soda fountain that keeps me coming back for more! I mean, I love the concept of this place with made to order salads. But man, do I love me some Boylan's Cream Soda! Only thing that woulda made this experience perfect is if they had diet cream soda. It only comes in black cherry, which is a strong second in my book. But let's get serious. There's more to this place than Boylan's (I guess:).  I may have said this in my Oakland Hello Bistro review, but it still blows my mind that Pittsburgh doesn't have more, if any, made to order salad places. It seems that in NYC there's one on every block. So you'd think that would trickle down to Pittsburgh at some point. Finally it has, with Eat n' Parks version.  Which means the best of Eat n' Park! That includes their superburger and grilled cheese. If only they had grilled stickies it would complete the trifecta! But coming here I try to stick to MOSTLY (see: Boylan's obsession) salads, since they do them right.  I love the fact that they toss in what you want, how much dressing you need and mix it. Those are always the main problems when you get a salad to go. I opted for their choice of the Caribbean Shrimp Salad. I thought it was good, but not quite what I had remembered it to be. THEN, I tried my friends salad dressing, the citrus chipotle BBQ, and went, danggit, I should have switched things up! It was gooood! My bad. Next time I'm doing things differently. But somehow I still think its going to be tasty. And as long as they have friendly service (which they did) and Boylan's soda, I'm sold!  I'm glad there's now one in South Side too because I didn't think there were a lot of healthy, fast local options. I'll be stopping for my soda and salad again soon!"}
{"text":"I love eat n park so was excited to try this once I heard it was owned by eat n park. Each time I have been here I've gotten the create your own salad which I LOVE but can never finish because it's so big, and the potato soup which is my favorite. At the one in Oakland there was something off about the soup that I just couldn't finish it. Other than that, I love it. The south side one is better though in my experience."}
{"text":"Even at 1:20 PM, this place is packed. I ordered the sesame soba salmon salad (kale + spinach) to go, but had asked for the kale to be completely replaced by spinach. Surprisingly the cashier said that it was impossible because it is a predesigned salad. I find it ironic that a place that prides itself on customizable salads can't even just make this simple adjustment. Nevertheless I took the salad with kale, rather than replicating the entire salad with spinach instead via the salad bar.  The discrepancy between the amount of salad portrayed on the picture and what I received was apparent. They didn't even fill it to the plastic brim, whereas other people's salads were overflowing.   Despite my criticisms, the salad was good. The avocado, edamame, and soba noodles were a unique way to spice up a salad. The Thai peanut dressing was slightly sweet, but didn't overpower the salmon or toppings."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!! What horribly bad service.  You have two things on your menu. Hamburgers and salads.  When you can't get that right it's time to close your doors.  We walked in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  There was already a line of people.  The cashier told us to come on up and place our order because all the people in front of us were waiting.  Three of us ordered burgers and fries, one milkshake and I got a salad.  As it turned out; ordering our food was the only thing that went smoothly during our visit.  I stood in line and the rest of my party got a table.  I must have stood there for at least 15 minutes.  NO ONE was building salads for people.  There was a person walking around filling ingrediencies but not one person (not even the cashier) was building salads for customers.  Finally, one person started to build salads for all the people waiting.  By this time, I had 5 people in front of me and 4 behind me.   By the time I got thru the line with my salad it was 25 minutes since I first walked in the door.  I got to my table and NONE of my party had gotten their meals.    One of my friends went up to complain at the 30-minute mark.  They were told \"We are sorry and it will be out in a minute\".  Ten minutes later (a total of 40 minutes since we walked in the door) the one girl building all the salads for people dropped off ONE burger. No fries just half of one order.  We asked were the fries are and the rest of our orders and she said they are coming.  You the hell drops off half an order?  We went up to complain to the manager. Again.  We were told the same thing.  We also inquired about the milkshake that we did not get.  The manager said \"oh let me get the for you\".  She turned around opened the freezer door and pulled out a milkshake.  FYI.  Hello Bistro claims \"Handspun\" milkshakes.  Don't waste your money.  It is all processed crap. We had one more burger get delivered. (with fries this time) We are still missing an entire order and a side of fries.  I had finished my salad and we decided to cut our losses and get our money back.  It was just over an hour waiting.  When we spoke to the manager to get a refund there was already 2 other families getting their money back as well.  Do not go here.  The management is worthless."}
{"text":"Of all the places on Forbes to stop and get dinner on the way home from work, this is my favorite.  After working a 12-13 hour day at the hospital, I want something quick that I can pick up and take home, but I don't want it to be heavy and fried.  The salad bar is ideal.  You get to choose your lettuce then a myriad of toppings and a protein for about $9.  The price is a little steep for a salad, but with the amount of food you get, I think it's well worth it.  Personally, I suggest the citrus chipotle BBQ dressing.  It's so good!  If you're choosing between chicken and steak, choose the chicken.  The steak I found to be a bit chewy and flavorless-but the chicken is delicious!  I've also had the italian grilled cheese which was delicious.  Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly, at least the lady taking my order was. The personalized salads are great and worth the price. The fries are something to avoid unfortunately."}
{"text":"Grabbed breakfast here with a friend. I was very impressed with the healthy selections (and reasonable prices)."}
{"text":"This place nailed it when it comes to salads. They have just about every salad topping you could possibly imagine plus some that you wouldn't. Price is about 9.50, but again with endless toppings and huge, that's pretty reasonable.  Only downside, they no longer serve beer (that I noticed). Who doesn't want a beer and a nutritious salad?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I want to love this place...I REALLY, really do! The salads have always been tasty and it's seems like a great option during the workday.   Each time I've been here (and I've been here numerous times), it's been an odd experience. Perhaps I'm just hitting them at tough times, but most of the time, the wait for a salad is pretty lengthy, it appears chaotic and there's food all over the floor.  Knowing this, I started ordering online for pick up. The first time I did this, I arrived at the time my order was to be ready and ended up waiting fifteen minutes for my salad to be prepared. The next time, the restaurant was \"temporarily closed\" (I'm not sure why). Today, I tried pre-ordering online again and when I showed up at 11:10 (for an 11:00 pick up), the restaurant was closed due to major water issues. I'm hoping I'm not charged for the salad that was never made, but I've heard nothing from the restaurant.  I totally understand that emergencies happen and days can be unpredictably busy or abnormal, but as a customer, I'm not sure how many more times I'll keep trying. Like I said, I REALLY want to love this place and continue to visit, but too many strange occurrences have me looking elsewhere for lunch. Is this a management issue? Not sure, but something's going on."}
{"text":"Overall Impression: A BYO-salad emporium with reasonable pricing that includes classic E'nP menu items like the Superburger and delicious Potato Soup--smiley cookies included!  The Food: If you're looking for healthy(ish) place filled with customization, this is amazing even for the pickiest salad eaters. The BYO-salad bar is really what this place is all about. Not only are the toppings plentiful and fresh, but they REALLY pack them in there to give you a bountiful meal that will not leave you hungry. I've also had their soups (classic E'nP style) and a couple of their burgers over the last couple years, and I was always satisfied with how they tasted. My go-to burger (pictured below) is the Two Alarm Turkey Burger with added Avocado for some extra creamy-ness. It may look a little messy, but the messiest burgers area always the best. The tomato soup is thick and sweet--not going to lie, tasted like Campbell's from a can (processed), it could probably do with some more herbs/TLC. When I have indulged in their fries, they've been extremely greasy, and their burgers are more greasy than others I've eaten, but it's not to the point where it makes the food unappetizing.   The Restaurant: This location has a great takeout setup (I'd high recommend if you hate waiting) and in-restaurant salad assembly line. Flipping the usual \"eat, then pay\" model on it's head, the customer begins their salad journey at the register and pays for either an $8 unlimited topping (they mean it) salad or a menu item. You're then guided to the salad assembly line, setup Subway style, where you pick all the toppings under the sun, and you get your own drink (no servers). You sit with a number at your table and they bring your meal to you. The only reason this place gets 3 instead of 4 stars from me is their cleanliness. Every time I walk in here, there's food all over the floor, the trash is overflowing, and empty tables are dirty. I also have a huge issue with their salad-makers not wearing any head coverings and just pulling their hair back. I wish they'd wear hats or hairnets--there's no way 5-10 women go through an entire day without hair flying around. The takeout shelf is very hands-off. You literally walk right in and pick up your bag (check it!) and leave without speaking to anyone and avoiding the salad assembly line, it definitely runs smooth.  TL;DR BYO customized salad for a reasonable price or try a classic burger. You can get your EnP comfort fix while still trying to be healthy---ish! Just do yourself a favor and order online to pickup."}
{"text":"decent salads.  While generally friendly, the service at times resembles a bunch of degenerate middle schoolers running around lost in circles, which can be deeply frustrating.  Granted this is Pittsburgh and stiff competition for those with fine culinary tastes  is obviously absent, so you'll wind up here whether you like it or not."}
{"text":"Hello Bistro is a go to for me. I love the concept. Everything always tastes and looks fresh. I always build my own salad and you can add 2 toppings if you want or 12! They have so many toppings i could never list all of them. Sometimes I have to ask for extra of a certain topping as they might just give you a tiny bit, but they never say no. They ask you how finely chopped you'd like your salad and how heavily dressed too. You have a lot of delicious dressing to choose from but the chipotle citrus bbq is my favorite. The salads are also so big that sometimes we'll go and split a salad and some fries if we're feeling it.   The inside has all metal chairs and some low and high tables. With the amount of traffic that goes through this location, sometimes it looks like the place could be cleaner. But if you eat in the restaurant you just leave your food on the table when you are done and they come clean it up for you which is really nice. I also like that they have ranch next to the drink machine and little sauce to-go containers that you can fill and take with you. Genius. This is always a quick dinner option for me as I always leave feeling full, but not super unhealthy."}
{"text":"Good to have a chipotle of salads! Unlimited toppings except your protein is extra. Great for salad lovers didn't try the burgers yet. Overall ok place for a quick healthy bite! Btw the ranch is bomb and Shawna was really nice!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I got the Italiano grilled cheese sandwich & the potato soup. It was delicious. The staff were also very friendly, polite, and helpful when it came down to suggesting things off the menu. Just left there about an hour ago & will definitely be back tomorrow to try a turkey burger."}
{"text":"Very good food. Rather small portions though. Fries were very good. They make their own fountain drinks which are very good. Would suggest to go for lunch instead of dinner"}
{"text":"Amazing place to get some healthy food. They have so much toppings I was surprised. I made my own salad with fresh watermelon and Apple. Love the salty and sweet mix."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and great customer service. So many options you can choose for salads. Love the quinoa salad with salmon. Tasty and refreshing all at the same time. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro was very inviting and clean. The prices are very reasonable and portions are decent. I ordered a salad that I couldn't even finish and chicken noodle soup that is Eat n Park's recipe. What I liked the most were the healthy options that they had and the option for them to build your own salad with fresh ingredients. There fountain drink dispenser also had different flavors like cream soda and ginger ale. Yum. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Hello Bistro has a very trendy vibe. I went on a Saturday around 12:30pm and there was no wait. I ordered a Texas Scrambler (a sandwich) and a cup of chicken noodle soup. The Texas scrambler was very delicious, but a tad on the greasy side. The chicken noodle soup was delicious, although the noodles were a tad doughy. The service was relatively fast (around 10min) and the employees are very nice."}
{"text":"So I've only been here twice the items on the menu all sound great and their salads look awesome. The first time I ordered from here I tried calling 3 times and they never picked up so  I ordered online and went to pick it up, when I went to pick it up they claimed they never received my order which was fine I understand computer systems sometimes mess up my grilled cheese was good. The second time I ordered from here I ordered a grilled cheese I just picked it up and I'm not even sure if they cooked it. It was buttery and not even crisp I'm pretty sad that every time I order from here something isn't right. So I paid 6 dollars for a buttery cheese sand which that wasn't even cooked..."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good. We came at around 8pm on Friday and it wasn't too bad. We got 2 burgers, fries, and a cesar salad to split, for 2 people, and it was plenty. The salad was yummy- a little heavy on the dressing though. The fries were crispy and thin. The burgers were juicy- old fashion burger style- patties super thin and not so crispy. Overall it was pretty good. Service was good too. Would try this place again."}
{"text":"I never thought I would refer to a salad place as one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. My friend suggested this place for lunch and all the while I was skeptical. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted my salad. I ordered a tandoori salad story and I finished the entire bowl. Citrus Lime Vinaigrette with fresh and crunchy kale, spinach, and quinoa was delicious. Sunflower seeds were a great addition to the salad.   I highly recommend trying this place. It is very busy during lunch and expect a wait time of up to 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Healthy food, long line ups but worth the wait. good vibe and everyone is dedicated to healthy eating."}
{"text":"Not good. Awkward and disappointing.  Eat N Park is Eat N Park. Some love it. Some hate it. Personally, I'm a big fan of Parkhurst. Their to go quarts are priced extremely reasonable, pick up is fast, the foods consistent for diner fare.   I have tried Hello Bistro multiple times and have finally given up on them. I'll drive to one of the E&P's near the city before I try Hello Bistro again.  Let's start with the soup- it's the exact same soup sold at Eat N Park, yet priced over $1 more per quart.  Why?!?  Same with many other items, pricier yet not close to being as good as the standard Eat N Park.  How can a place that has everything in place to be awesome, screw up burgers and gourmet grilled cheeses?... Try Hello Bistro and you can find out.   Kids meals- how is it that a place that has 50+ salad fixings, serves every kids meal with fries?! And the kids meals are the same as Eat N Park but twice the price without any healthy side options. Serving milk doesn't make French fries healthy. It's just goofy and not urban family minded.  Mind you, my toddlers $5 grilled cheese was acceptable in his opinion. It's nice to have your kids dinner cost $1.25 per bite. (Those w small kids will understand)  The fries were given to the dogs, who thoroughly enjoyed them. I tasted one and thought they were gross. I much preferred when I bought my kid the same sandwich at the Ohio River Blvd Eat N Park w a side of grapes and the total was a little over $2.   The customer service in this location is just- blah.  I don't expect perfection. Things happen. Ingredients run out, but I'm never made to feel like this location actually feel cares if my order can't be filled in its entirety.   I've tried. I've tried more than once. I've given up.  Our last two orders were just beyond not good, awkward and disappointing."}
{"text":"Always pleased when I come here! I usually make my own salad and I'm never disappointed. Many toppings to choose from and staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Why is this one so much better than the Oakland location?  I don't really know, but I can say that I'm happy about it.  I put my previous two terrible Oakland experiences aside, braved the new location in Downtown Pittsburgh, and walked away a changed man.  First attempt:  late lunch, 1:30 PM, mid-week.  The place was a ghost town (awesome!) I walked right up to the counter, ordered a Rachel burger, and was promptly delivered my burger in a few short minutes.  The burger was good, if not messy, and my only gripe would be that the turkey-burger patty is clearly from frozen.  Nonetheless, still a tasty meal and the place was really clean with super friendly employees.  Second attempt:  Noon, mid-week.  The place was packed and there was a decent sized line.  Service was still prompt and while the Salad Bar Engineers did look a bit frazzled, they handled my requests promptly.  Minor disappointment was the meager topping rations provided when I asked for a) chopped eggs b) bacon c) croutons.  If all salad toppings are free, why are you skimping on these things? (And I do mean skimp, like teaspoon size serving.)  Next time I'll be \"that guy\" and tell them to double up.    When I finally made my way to the Cold Stone Creamery-esque salad amalgamation station, I was presented with two options: \"Big bites or little bites?\"  Unhappy with such restrictions, I countered with \"medium bites?\" to a non-plussed chopper.  She did, however, comply with my clearly ridiculous request.    In all, the salad was very good and I'll definitely go back (only to this location).  Oakland-location still needs to learn that avocados aren't supposed to be dark brown when placed on salads and that sweaty forearms are not an appropriate salad tong resting station in-between grabbing items from the salad bar."}
