{"text":"how does a bar not have bud light, then run out of coors and coors light on a saturday night????? piss poor management.....don't go here, you have been warned......"}
{"text":"Great place to have a couple drinks The foods pretty good a little overpriced and The food service is not that great. At least not at night on the weekends I will go back but probably not to eat"}
{"text":"This bar and grill is awesome!!! I absolutely love it and the food is AMAZING! awesome service, awesome venue, awesome drinks, awesome EVERYTHING!! Deeply believe everyone should go in for a good time!"}
{"text":"Drinks were good. Beer was perfect temperature. Started off dead and a little awkward but by 1030pm the place was full and much more lively.   Band for the night could use an update from the old country into some newer music to keep the younger crowd. Overall nice place."}
{"text":"We have driven past this restaurant several times and decided to finally give it a try.  We are always afraid of a new place when it's not busy but the hostesses were very polite and the atmosphere was what I expected in a place called Cowboys Saloon.  We don't often have appetizers but the Cowboy Deviled Eggs were great!  We pretty much stick to healthy foods so when we eat out its salads with chicken or salmon and I have to say that the two we choose,  rank in the tastiest of all.  It was a great way to spend our 29th anniversary.   A special thanks to Zac our server who was awesome.  The perfect amount of time and advice on food choice. I would have given 5 stars but we would have liked to see chicken on the menu.  will go back again!"}
{"text":"Last nite we had a party of 20ish people and I completely understand the issues that come with a larger crowd BUT the issues we had here were ridiculous.  1. Our waitress didn't come visit our table for 45min 2. Never came back with any drinks for half the table. 3. After speaking w/ a manager we got a second waiter and service improved slightly. He proceeded to tell us that the menus we were ordering from were not their menus but he just handed them to us to order from. Umm what?  4. The entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something. So we decided to order bottled beer and were told they were out of all domestic bottles. And this wasn't late at nite this was at 7:30.  5. We were told they were out of multiple liquors but in actuality the waitress was just lazy and didn't want to bring back drinks because once we spoke w/ a manager we received the drinks that were on the menu we were told were not theirs.  6. We decided to get drinks ourselves and go up to the bar where only 2 bartenders were working. Again ummmm what? This location can accommodate 200+ people on a weekend and management seems to think that 2 bartenders is sufficient.  Worst service. Won't ever return nor will any of the crowd that was with us.  This establishment definitely needs new management and daily meetings with their staff."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The hostesses are very sweet. Sit you promptly, open the door for you when you are arriving & leaving. The servers are great! Fridays & Saturdays are pretty busy & the dance floor is HUGE! The food is really good. I love all the different specials they have on a daily basis. & not to mention that happy hour is from 3-7pm! Love this place. Will definitely come back soon. (:"}
{"text":"Came to this \"mall\" to pick up some See's candy for my mum. Saw Toby Keith restaurant was gone, and this has replaced it. Immediately greeted upon entering. My 4 year old and I were offered a booth immediately. Waiter was friendly, professional, nice to chat with. Our order was correct and delicious. Not super busy this time of evening  (530-600 on a Wednesday) but service and food was superb. Definitely would return on next trip to Arizona. Easy location to access off 99th Avenue. I hope they continue to succeed."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night. Took both of my sisters, her son and my wife. Thought it would be a nice experience but it was the worst experience in have EVER had in a restaurant. My nephew ordered a burger with just meat and cheese. When the good came out they brought him nachos cause the server \"thought that's what he said\"  even though we said no bun. The server Made my Nephew Feel bad. He even asked if he could eat the nachos. Didn't offer to make what he ordered. I spent 98.00 on good and service that was poor! Not a hood experience at all. Too bad.."}
{"text":"After watching a tv spot that covered Cowboy's Saloon opening, I was excited to visit.  We were enthusiastically greeted as we entered, and promptly seated.  It took about 5 minutes or so for our server, Benjamin, to approach the table.  He informed us that we had 10 minutes left for happy hour.  We ordered drinks and appetizers.  We waited 25 minutes to receive our drinks!  Not sure if they are understaffed or what, but 25 minutes to get drinks?   Then we were brought appetizers, oh but wait, they weren't ours.  Finally, we got our meals.  I had the pulled pork.  The pork was very good but the brioche bun was a little greasy.  2 people at my table had ribs which they thought were ok.  Although our server was apologetic, I don't  think I'll be going back as I can get better service and food at more convenient establishments."}
{"text":"Great vibe! Awesome food! And great deals every night! What other restaurant has a 4 hour long happy hour every day!! Half off all beer cocktails and wine! And almost all of the appetizers everyday! Would recommend highly! Monday night 1/2 off burgers, Wednesday night specials on ribs and Thursday specials on prime rib!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  We had a group of six and we were seated promptly.  The server didn't know what beers they had on tap and what they call \"Craft Beers\" are simply just your mid-size brewery's like New Belgium, Left Hand, etc. which is available at most stores selling a decent beer selection.  I was not very impressed with the food.  I ordered a burger which was greasy and plain.  On a positive side, I would say this place is ok for families because there's lots of room and they seem to tolerate wild young-uns well.  On a side note, the night we visited the Arizona Cardinals were holding a pep rally in the restaurant.  The pep rally was a good event.  What surprised me was how sparse the fan crowd was.  If it was a Green Bay Packer or Pittsburgh Steeler rally, the place would've been jam packed!"}
{"text":"Huge venue !! Great for big parties!! Deals everyday of the week be sure to swing by!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars only because the food was pretty good - on Monday nights they have their burgers half price, and that is a good deal for a decent burger.  But...we had a bad experience on leaving.   They closed around 8:00pm because our party of 3 were the only ones there. They asked us to close out our tabs, but after waiting for about 15-20 minutes the bartender let us know that the system was down and the manager was working to get it back up.  After another maybe 10 minutes she said that we would need to pay in cash.   We didn't have cash so she pointed to the ATM...really?  We asked to see the manager a couple of times, but he refused to come out of the back.  We asked if we could have a beer or two removed from the tab to cover the ATM fees and after the bartender talked to the manager yet again, he said we could just pay with whatever cash we had so we wouldn't have to use the ATM - unfortunately we had no cash at all and felt bad leaving nothing, so we ended up taking money out of the ATM.  The manager never came out once the system went down, and instead had the bartender run back and forth relaying messages several times.   Very poor management - we would have been happy with an apology and maybe a beer or two comped for our trouble, but just got ignored.  Doubtful we will be back..."}
{"text":"Our first impression of Cowboys was great-fun vibe and I love the huge dance floor.  We were seated fairly quickly and drinks taken, but then no one came to take our order for probably 20 minutes at least.  We finally had to flag someone down.  Clearly there was a miscommunication of sorts.  Everyone was very friendly though and willing to help. Food came out quickly.  My hubby for a burger and fries-great size burger.  Good value which made up for the fried green tomato caprese.  I love caprese and I love fried green tomatoes.  But this missed the mark.  The tomatoes had no flavor and were very hard.  Clearly they were not ripe (cause yes I know the difference between a non ripe tomato and a true green tomato).  The portion was small as well which was ok cause I didn't want to eat it all anyway, just saying it wasn't worth the money. The cowboy nachos are good.  We all enjoyed those. I would like to come back for live music and dancing.  Overall it was a 'fair' experience, just not outstanding.  My husband really loved his burger and wants to come back."}
{"text":"Ok been there 5 times over the past few weeks. Food is amazing service was great.and the prices are very much reasonable.   My complaint is that they never have any  Bud lite or any Budweiser  products...now Bud lite and Michelob Ultra are extremely popular in this town. If I am looking for dinner or lunch...Cowboys is the place,happy hour....party with my friends..but we will go elsewhere..Probably why I am with a group of my friends drinking Bud lite at the Cabin grill across the parking lot from cowboys"}
{"text":"Ok, here we go... I ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.  The meatloaf was so incredibly dense, I had to cut it with a knife...you should never have to cut meatloaf with a knife!  The potatoes were fine, the brussel sprouts had a really nice, sweet flavor (and were served with walnuts, which wasn't listed on the menu--for anyone with a nut allergy), but were cut so large, it was hard to eat them.  Hubby ordered a rack of ribs with cheesy grits and mac n'cheese.  Per my hubby, they tasted so dry and overcooked, he thought they were leftover from a previous day and warmed up again.  I tried to take a bite of one, and could barely pull it off the bone.  His sides were very good, and he gobbled those up immediately!   The reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2, is because...the food had issues, but the flavors were there.  Everything tasted good, so it's hard to fault it completely.  Also, our server was very nice, and was able to accommodate me with a substitution."}
{"text":"Wow what a venue! The food is southern themed and it's absolutely delicious. The made to order skillet cornbread is out of this world, and it comes with a house made honey butter. I came out on Saturday night with some friends for dinner and drinks, as well as to see the live band playing that night. To start we had the Cowboy Eggrolls (barbecue pulled pork and coleslaw inside), the Outlaw Killer Shrimp (fried shrimp in a spicy sauce), and the Chicken and Waffle Sliders (hand battered fried chicken on house made waffles). I had the Sirloin Chili and it was just like real texas chili, all meat, no beans, perfect. For my entree I had the BBQ Sampler (Ribs, Pulled Pork, Smoked Sausage, and Brisket) with the brussels sprouts and house mac and cheese. For dessert We split the Fried Oreos and it was as amazing as it sounds (ice cream, whipped cram, and double fried oreos). The menu has a lot of great options for lighter eaters too. One of my friends had the BBQ salmon salad, it had this awesome spicy vinaigrette on it.   They have some great specials through the week too, 1/2 price burgers on monday, cheap ribs on wednesday, and 12.99 prime rib on Thursday.  The band was great too and they even had a mechanical bull! They have a huge dance floor and line dancing classes on tuesdays, wednesdays, and fridays. Drinks were reasonably priced, and we heard they had some really cheap drink specials on thursdays and fridays.   All in all it was a really fun night, the service was outstanding (our server was so attentive and nice). We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on sat July 23rd 2016.  Got there around 5 and the place was empty.  Ordered prime rib and wife ordered ribeye both med rare.  After an extremely long wait for an empty restaurant, the food came at the same time as the salad.  Someone not our server brought the food and said who ordered the sirloin?  Didn't really think of it at that time that wife ordered ribeye not sirloin. She cut into it was was raw not rare but raw.  Sent it back.  They put it back on the grill, charred the entire piece and was now med to med well.  When wife finally got to try her first piece she said this isn't ribeye.  I looked and tried a piece and it was tough and the cut had no marbling in it like ribeye should.   Server came over and said she put ribeye on the ticket.  Asked for manager.  11 min later manager came and he said he couldn't tell what the cut was but was going to ask the cook and come back.  He never came back.   I asked server if manager was coming back and she said he took the difference off the bill from a ribeye price to a sirloin price.  So clearly we were served a sirloin.  Wife ate 1/3 of it and said it was too tough.  My prime was blah, no seasoning.   Server was pleasant and she got a good tip.  30 min after we got home the diarrhea started.  Ruined the night and will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Very average food.  Can get the same crap anywhere in town for a lot less.  Women's restroom has one big fancy sink and no where to place your purse to wash your hands or refresh your makeup except on the big wet sink.  Really?? Come on!!   Also, patio had much to be desired.  I am a smoker and you are allowed to smoke but no where to place your butts except in the alley that look like trash...cigarette butts, napkins, straws and crap!!"}
{"text":"Just witnessed an excellent bartender well known to me from another establishment with great mixology skills get fired during his shift for leaving building during his break.Thought the manager on duty could have professionally let him go after shift. They lost a good guy...Cowboy Saloons total loss. Left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! I've eaten just about every thing on the menu and haven't come across a meal I didn't like. The burgers kick ass. Great music and location."}
{"text":"Great place. Great on tap selection and music. The only reason for not giving a five star was the Buffalo Chips were cold. My On The Border burger was fantastic. Lots of avocado and onion rings. My wife and I had two beers and dinner for $31.00. VERY reasonable. The bar is great with lots of screens. We will be back here for sure. Come after 9:00PM for live country music and dancing. This is a must stop for Cowboys and Cowgirls on the west side of Phoenix. Come see John at the bar."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place to go on a weekend night. I love the new dance floor as I was used to this place being Toby Keith's. I didn't eat here so I can't say how good the food is. We made a reservation for my birthday and they really did a great job serving us. The waitress was amazing. I thought it was weird we had to do bottle service to reserve tables for a large party but I figure we probably would have spent more on drinks. Overall I love the place and will be back sometime to country dance. Love the live band!"}
