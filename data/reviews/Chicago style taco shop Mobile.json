{"text":"Hey order guy, just because I'm white doesn't mean I don't like hot salsa. 
I ordered a carne asada burrito, and when I asked for hot salsa to be added they guy said it's really hot and I should get it on the side. Boy was he wrong neither of the salsas I tried had any real heat to them, and tasted like bad versions of Roberto's salsa. The meat didn't have any flavor either, and it was over priced and they charge $.50 to use your debit card. 
I and my in-laws both make better tasting and hotter salsa then this place. I won't be returning here and if you want better Mexican food try a Roberto's or Don Tore Tacos"}
{"text":"Best taco place in North Las Vegas. If you are craving some delicious Mexican food... come here!! They have variety and after tasting quite a bit of their menu I can honestly say it is all done right with great flavors! Owners and staff are super friendly and helpful. The location is clean. So, just head over and enjoy!"}
{"text":"These Asada Fries are the best things since Robertos these fries will knock your socks off with their delicious flavor I give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Literally the best taco place in Vegas. Weve tried so many places in Vegas and this is the first place that has amazing customer service skills and amazing tacos and fries. It's nice to eat a meal out where the food has flavor and doesn't make you feel like garbage after eating it! I'm so glad I tried the Chicago style taco mobile stand"}
