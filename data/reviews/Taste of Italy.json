{"text":"From a transplanted NY'R this pizza is great only done take out so can't tell about the dining experience but if you want great pizza this is your place"}
{"text":"This family has been around the valley for a long time. I remember them from Peoria. Always friendly, and always great food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This is the only ny style family pizza joint my family goes to. Everythings delicious!"}
{"text":"The pasta is so good here!!! So flavorful! It doesn't look like much when you first walk in but it is my new favorite. The penne with vodka sauce was BOMB. Stuff is super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian food we have had. The pasta had no flavor, tasted like chalk. The wine was Gallo...be prepared. We left most of our meal and walked without take out boxes. Waste of money!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in the West Valley, say Goodyear area, I would truly recommend Brother's Pizza Express. It's a great mom and pop place you can't really get in Phoenix. The owners came from NYC - those New Yorkers just know how to make great pizza! :)

I think I'm going to make it a tradition to stop by this place on my way to or from California since I'm hardly ever on the West Valley. 

Their prices are cheap and you get your money's worth when you go. The people are very friendly and are very personable with their customers. I think if you live in the area and go their a lot it wouldn't be a bad idea to make this place your regular place for pizza. 

Great pizza and customer service! Hope to stop by soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, my wife is from Brooklyn and she thinks this is the most authentic pizza in town. We go all the time and the family that owns it are really nice people."}
{"text":"Good food with fast and friendly service. The Chicken Parmesan was good and came with pasta, salad & bread for $9,75."}
{"text":"This has become our go to place when we're wanting pizza. My sister is from out of town, so when she comes to visit, taste of Italy is always a must! Love their pizza & wings! Great prices & excellent customer service. All employees are always so nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly restaurant. Servers are very friendly and helpful. We ordered the delicious Taste of Italy pizza, we were amazed by the awesome flavors. The owner has nice old photos of him back in the day. He was nice enough to tell us a story. Service like this is hard to find now days. Great place to bring the family. Definitely will back coming back in the future. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"Goodyear, AZ is a growing community. We have the Cancer Center, Cleveland Indians & Cincinnati Reds for Spring Training and we have Taste of Italy.

As a native of Brooklyn, NY, it is very difficult to find great pizza and Italian cuisine. Let me tell you, Taste of Italy is the best New York Food in the west valley! Great food, great hospitality at reasonable prices from the owner Dino and his family. 

Save lots of money from traveling to Italy or even New York City and come visit us here in Goodyear, AZ, for great pizza, pasta, wings, calzones, and family atmosphere at Taste of Italy.

And tell Dino, Hall of Fame DJ/Entertainer Ray Mar sent you!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Reminds me of pizzerias back in NYC. Pizza was comparable to NYC pizza. Good thin crust, decent sauce. Nice service"}
{"text":"Authentic NY pizza and fantastic Italian food. I have eaten pizza all over the United Stares and this ranks with some of the best! If you're in Goodyear,AZ stop by and try or for yourself."}
{"text":"We live close by so we order take out a lot. Most of the time the food is excellent but one time when we went there we had pasta with Alfredo sauce and it tasted gritty like there was fine sand in it. The meals were subtracted from our check but the guy acted like he didn't think it was possible."}
{"text":"Wow - this place is a hidden gem in Goodyear - absolutely worth the drive from anywhere in the West Valley.  The pastas are out of this world - homemade sauces made fresh to order.  The alfredo is probably the best alfredo I have ever had in my life.  The calzones and pizza are good as well.  This seems to be owned by the nicest, kindest Italian family and they all just make me smile whenever we go in for dinner.  Extremely affordable prices and friendly service.  This is NOT TO BE MISSED.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place to eat with tasty food!  We use them to cater our lunch meetings and they always deliver and the food is good. The egg plant Parmesan is quite tasty too!!"}
{"text":"We walked in here to get a slice and some gelato. The place is very clean, and the people that work here are very nice, but, most importantly, the food is delicious, and taste just like it does in New York City. Great stuff. I recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"I've had so many people tell me to give this place another try, but the first time was so horrible, I just can't do it. My husband and I are from the East Coast (he's EC Italian) and the food was just awful. Even the soda was terrible, not sure how that happens. We both ended up with terrible digestion problems for the next day from the food, as well. I know a lot of people like it, but I just can't agree...and I can't bring myself to go for a second opinion after how ill I was almost a year ago (that's how much the bad is sticking in my memory)."}
{"text":"I'm a Scottsdale resident and was recently in Goodyear on business. Saw Taste of Italy and stopped in for a slice. Authentic NY Pizza and personality. Highly recommend to anyone in the area. If I lived closer I'd be a frequent flyer here, THANKS!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Great Italian food. Loved the Hero Special and the Calzone special. For dessert, canoli is a must! Delicious :)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is amazing!  They are fast, and the wings are my favorite.  The price is right, and great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"If in the area, and looking for a place to relax and enjoy a nice meal, reasonable prices, clean and quiet environment, outstanding service, food is fresh and authentic, YOU MUST eat here!!!

You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Location: Not a bad area by any means, but definitely off the beaten track. 

Curb appeal: Easily recognizable. Not austentatious. Very simple look. 

Dining area: Clean. Furniture is up to date. Booth seating wasn't very comfortable. 

Bathroom: Bring your own toilet paper. My girlfriend had to swipe some from the men's room. 

Staff: Friendly and personable. Easy to chat with if you make the effort. 

Presentation: The metal cooking plate on a dinner plate was a pain. Kept sliding around while I was trying to eat. It's a diner, not a restaurant. Styrofoam cups, etc. 

Food:

The side salad was disappointing. Iceberg lettuce, canned olives, banana peppers, a couple slices of tomato. The Italian dressing was pretty good. The bread was also pretty good. 

I had the fried zucchini appetizer. It was ok. Obviously freshly cooked since it was too hot to eat for quite some time. The quality didn't justify the cost. I'd give it 2 out of 5.

I ordered the lasagna. The sauce was decent. The pasta was softer than I like. Generous amount of cheese. I didn't care for the meat. 3 out of 5. 

My girlfriend had the manicotti. The sauce was much more acidic, very tomatoey. The plate as a whole was better than my lasagna. 4 out of 5. 

We ordered a pizza to go, since everyone seems to rave about it. Very good decision. We got the Taste of Italy, Sicilian size. Crust is similar to pizza hut, except much better. Not oily like PH, not quite as bready. Crisp edges, chewy bottom. Copious amount of toppings. Nice amount of cheese and sauce. Overall very good pizza. 4 out of 5. 

I'd eat here again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Beats any other Italian restaurant out the waters!!!! This will Deff be our to go place for now on when we want Italian food!!! When they say authentic they MEAN authentic!!!! Great customer service too!!!! Oh and try the garlic knots!!!! You won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, we wait an hour for delivery  the pizza was cold zucchini is cold and then the owner says we should package our food return it.  Work on your customer service."}
{"text":"Food was not too good, go to the one by the estrella yacht club.  There, pizza and calzones are good"}
{"text":"I've never given one star before but the pizza was just eh. The quality was poor. I'm visiting from out of town and I was hoping the yelp reviews served me right but unfortunately their Margarita pizza just wasn't very good. It tasted like I got it from 7-11. Highly disappointed especially because it ended up costing about $22 for sauce, parse mozzarella, and dried up basil."}
{"text":"Talk about location! This place is pretty well hidden but like all difficult finds are, well worth it. My wife, son, and I ate here in late March and loved the food. I had chicken Parmesan and she had the lasagna. Sauce is amazing. Bread they serve is unforgettable. I'm a pizza freak so a few weeks we decided to order 3 pizzas for the family. They all asked where i got it from because it was good. White pizza, margarita, and pepperoni. This is my go to for Italian now."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood Italian restaurant! Excellent marinara sauce, great pizza, fresh and friendly. Good prices too. I really enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews but this place isn't great. My husband and I had a chance to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary and wanted to try a new Italian restaurant. I'm a self proclaimed pizza whore. I'm Sicilian and I have high standards for Italian food. 
I ordered a pepperoni and sausage Sicilian style pizza, it was very plain, sauce had no flavor (I ordered extra sauce to really get a taste of the sauce) and the crust was dry that I could tap it on the table top. My husband ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken (with extra alfredo sauce) and he was adding salt, pepper and garlic powder to give it flavor. I asked if he liked it and he said it was okay but later admitted in the car that it was awful, he was just worried to hurt the employees feelings in case they overheard him.  
You have to order your food at the counter as well. They did give us complimentary free sodas, you also get a basket of bread and salad with dine in."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in an industrial area -- literally right across from some refinery -- and the area smelled horribly when we arrived last night (which, thankfully, did not penetrate into the restaurant).  It seems an odd place to open a pizza place, until you realize, that you not only have the local industries there to service (most likely for lunch), but that there's also a stadium nearby.  Nevertheless, keep an eye open when looking for this establishment:  it's not hard to find; it just isn't where you'd expect it to be.

Like almost all the local pizza shops out here, the place is run by Albanians.  I know, that seems strange, too; but there are many Albanians in southern Italy and many Albanians go to Italy for work and vacation.  As one reviewer wrote, the place is quite clean and the decoration is warm and tasteful.  Service is fast and also very good; so there's no complaint with either of those,

The food is good.  I had the baked ziti; my partner had chicken parmesan.  The antipasto salad was also good.  The problem is, I can't say more than that.  I liked it while we ate it; I had no issues of any kind after the meal; and I was glad we went there.  But I found nothing extraordinarily special about the food.  

Frankly, I'd recommend the place for its service and the cleanliness of the restaurant.  But if we wanted to go to a pizzeria, we wouldn't lose sleep, if we ended up going somewhere else.

Nothing negative; just nothing noteworthy.  Try it!  There'll be no disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and our food was delicious. My husband had the calzone special and I had the eggplant parmigiana ( vegetarian must) very generous portions and delish. Great prices and authentic"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened & honestly the pizza and service is the best every time I eat here. I remember the walk from my house with my older brothers. Don't miss out on the best pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Pizza I've ever had! We love coming here. Service is excellent, they treat you like family. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a small pizza/pasta restaurant located in somewhat of a remote area would have such delicious food.    Well, it does!   The restaurant had two table occupied when we arrived, but it quickly picked.   

The portions were generous and the prices were definitely reasonable.    Three in our party ordered the lasagna and all stated  that it was excellent.    We stopped after a Kansas City Royals game, so we probably won't have another opportunity this year to come back here.   So, for those of you who like good Italian food with reasonable prices please give this place a try.    Because we want to ensure that this restaurant continues to stay in existence until next year."}
{"text":"Went there w friends a few days ago. Atmosphere is great friendly and inviting. It's like being home. The staff /owner were very friendly. Food was great. Will go back. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the owner Dino and all his staff! Great owner, Great food!! 5 stars for this authentic Gem! I normally get the mushroom calzone and it's always on point! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Phoenix area, definelty worth the drive to have real good Italian food! DELICIOUS! Good food, family friendly environment and at great cost!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good about this place! If you are looking for authentic NY pizza, then you need not look any further. My husband is from Brooklyn and I also lived in NYC for many years and this is just like sitting in a NYC pizzeria. The owner is so nice and will make almost anything on request. When they first opened, they did not have garlic knots on the menu so we would call and ask the owner to make them for us and he always did. Now they have them on the menu so we feel a little responsible for that, LOL. I always order mine extra wet and garlicky. I could take out the entire town of Transylvania's vampire population with one deep exhale after a batch of those yummy garlic knots. They are a must!

We drive close to an hour round trip, all the way from West Buckeye to get our pizza from Taste of Italy and it is worth every mile. The smell of it in our car on the way home has forced us to pull over to the side of the road and eat like starving heathens, right out of the box on a number of occasions. If you are looking for your run-of-the-mill, cardboard box, national chain pizza, this is not the place for you, but if you want authentic, N.Y. style pizza that will make your taste buds wake up and say, \"Fuggeddaboudit\" like a true Italian, then get off the internet, put your butt in the car and go to Taste of Italy and have some real Italian food! Mangia!"}
{"text":"I personally don't think Phoenix has much for good pizza. Many claim to be New York pizzerias. These guys are by far the closest I have tasted. If you go during the day you will get awesome service. The slice pizza is the best because it is cooked again when you orrder it making it more authentic tasting."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. The people are very friendly. However, we are originally east coasters and prefer.Ledo's. Still looking."}
{"text":"This place is a great little spot to eat. My wife and I went for dinner last night and not only is it comfortable but the food was fantastic. I had the Steak Special Sandwich and my wife had the Chicken Parm Sandwich, we shared an order of Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce. A lot of food but we really enjoyed it and took some home.

We got an order of Fettuccine Alfredo to go for my daughter and she also thought it was very good. The Italian dressing for the salad was fantastic and the bread was some of the best I've had.

The prices were very reasonable and this will definitely be a regular spot of ours now."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  You order up front and I'm pretty sure the older gent who took my order was authentically from Italy.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Very homely feel with casual tables.  It's a bit out of the way for us but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat for a casual lunch or something. It's not the cleanest place I've ever been, and the service is ok at best. They do have good food as long as you don't mind getting your main course before your appetizer. Dino is definitely a cool guy, but he cares about money more than his costumers. I recommend this place for lunch because they do have good food, but don't expect to be treated like you're special."}
{"text":"I love and miss this place. It's a little more expensive than Pizza Hut or Dominoes but it's worth it. The cheese is so hot and yummy. The sauce is just right. Not too little or too much bread. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was sitting at my desk today bored to death.  I began to think \"what should I have for lunch today?\".  I am completely burnt out on fast food, burgers etc.   At that moment I remembered Taste of Italy.  I figured, that would be something different so I jumped in my truck and headed that way.  

I arrived and walked in.  The owner recognized me and took my order right away.  I ordered a meatball sub and side salad.  He made the salad right then and off I went while they worked on the sub.  I think you might be hard pressed to find a fresher salad.  It was crispy and clean and had excellent flavor.  So, my sub was brought out about the time I was finished with my salad.  The roll was perfect, the cheese melted and the meatballs were very good.  The only problem is that my phone rang just as I took a bite.  So, what to do?  I now have a scorching hot meatball in my mouth and trying to talk on the phone at the same time.  The cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and burnt, my eyes watered and I could not talk....   One slurp of Diet Coke and I was saved....   I am sure this has happened to all of you once in your life.   

Well, to wrap up my review, I had an awesome lunch and a good price.  Clean surroundings and great service....   

I think its as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Very good!! Must try them!! Some of the best NY Style Italian food in AZ!! The lasagna was very good, prolly the best baked Zitti my mom had ever tasted!! Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Pizza and some Lasagna. Pizza was really good! The lasagna not So much tasted like the microwave dinner you can buy at frys but came with a small salad which was good! Clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"Calzone and stombolis are so good. makes two meals!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here with a plate of Chicken Parmesan in front of me, while my wife has a Sausage Calzone. 
We ordered a side of Hot Wings and Mozzarella Sticks in order to get a variety of flavors. 

The first thing I noticed was that the staff had no smiles. When I asked what the best thing on menu was, they kept trying to tell me the three things that sold the most. No points here. 

My meal came with a salad and bread, which was the upside of our experience. The bread was quite delicious, and the salad was as well (if you picked out the occasional piece of brown Iceberg lettuce). The salad was crisp and refreshing. 

The Mozzarella Sticks were homemade, which was surprising! I was very pleased with the light, crisp coating surrounding the cheese. Well done!

Now, for the sauce: the sauce clearly starts out with a Mirepoix (carrots, celery, and onions) which is a more traditional approach to marinara sauce than the usual Pizza/Pasta restaurant. It can be on the sweeter side, so be prepared if you are in the mood for a more savory sauce.  The breading on my chicken was nice and soggy by the time I got it at my table, and the pasta was a little over-cooked. It made the meal a very distracting one and not that enjoyable. 

The Calzone had entirely too much cheese, and not nearly enough flavor. The sausage was lacking in full flavor and was sliced too thin for a meal that is usually quite hearty. The bread was delicious, however. 

Overall, the experience was less than enjoyable. The food had missed the mark on several points, and the unenthusiastic staff made it that much harder to swallow."}
{"text":"If I could give Taste of Italy 10 stars I would!

I ordered garlic bread, and stuffed shells. My husband had spaghetti with sausage, and my son ordered meat ravioli. 

Each entree came with a great salad that was topped with grated mozzarella cheese. 

The garlic bread was almost pizza without the sauce and they gave us a small cup of sauce for dipping. 

The filling inside the stuffed shells was perfect. It was obviously fresh made as it was creamy smooth. Most other restaurants serve shells, and cheese ravioli from the freezer which makes the cheese filling dry. 

The sausage was wonderful!! It tasted way beyond great. The meat ravioli was great too. 

The sauce they use is very good too. 

Needless to say, each one of us cleaned our plate. 

Now, it was time to try their cannoli. 
I have had cannoli around town where the filling was alright and the shell soft. Ugh. 

The Taste of Italy knows how to make cannoli!!
The filling was very creamy, not too sweet, and had a few mini chocolate chips. The shell was CRISPY!!! Yea! This again had to be fresh made because the filling was so very creamy. Yummy!

So, I guess you might be under the impression that I was pleased with their food and would recommend Taste of Italy to everyone. And you're correct! We didn't try their pizza, yet. 

Go there. You will experience REALLY great Italian cuisine. I spent 36 years in the New York City area, and after 31 years in Phoenix am thrilled to have finally found something that tastes like home. A Taste of Italy is a clear winner!"}
{"text":"Fiancé and I decided to give this place a try. We ordered the medium hot wings, and a thin crust pizza with pineapple and half mushroom. The food was very good. I would definitely come back for one of their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Ordered a slice.  Pizza not bad if you like NY style.  Ordered meat ravioli.  Cooked from Frozen and only four ravioli in order?  Kind of a rip off.  Employees very nice and efficient"}
{"text":"This is our go to place when I do not feel like cooking!  It is really amazing and NY style food.  The sauce is made fresh daily and it is not over powered by spices or salt like most \"chain\" places.  The salad is FRESH - meaning you hear a crunch from the lettuce and the tomatoes are always read and yummy.  The pizza is not doughy and it is easy to eat more then you really were thinking of.  The staff is knowledgable and very nice!  Best of all they do not fry fish or shellfish so I can eat here and not get sick.  
As for the bad reviews - I bet these reviewers are use to overly spiced chain food.  I use to work for one of them and they put so much salt and pepper in them to mask the fact that its not fresh."}
{"text":"Such good food! We ordered the lasagna, baked ziti, calzone and pizza (little bit of everything!) it was all DELICIOUS! Super friendly service, too! Worth the out of the way location. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service.  We're new residents to Montecito, we've had Chicken Alfredo with penne, and sausage Mariana with penne pasta.  We recently tried Ex lg Taste of Italy pizza less green peppers and added fresh garlic.  Yummmmm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So we have driven by numerous times and said \"we need to try it sometime\" and then I have some cop friends that eat there so it has to be good, right?
Yes it is!  - Glad we finally stopped the other night, my vodka sauce on my dish was VERY tasty as was their marinara sauce.  Now their sausage wasn't quite to our liking (not spicy enough) but you might like it.
Their pizza looks and smells great and next time we will get some Pizza for sure!  Family owned and run, so why not give them a shot?
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved here and wasn't quite ready to attack the kitchen and cook meals. Was busy unpacking so I ordered dinner for the family and it was a win. Food arrived fast and it was good. A nice go to place in an area that is limited with options."}
{"text":"OMG the best!  Loved the meatball sandwich and Calzone.  Don't miss this place! Authentic great food.  Nice staff clean restaurant with good fair prices"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Taste of Italy while checking out Estrella Mountain Ranch community for a quick lunch of pizza. Coming from New York I am a bit of a pizza snob and think nobody can match a good New York pizza. Well these guys have done it! The pizza was delicious! A nice thin crust just crisp enough topped with a tasty sauce and just the right amount of cheese. A home run here! I would highly recommend this place for some great pizza."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant. The pizza and wings are always good. The pizza is not heavy on the sauce and the crust is delicious. The wings are always crispy and hot. I tried the pasta dishes and they aren't anything special. Service is great and food always comes out quickly."}
{"text":"We  give our highest recommendations for to Taste of Italy for their Professionalism and Great customer care services provided by the staff and management team.
The good is Great.
Highly recommended by Minister MOSES and Yvonne Findley."}
{"text":"Ate there today, had the specialty pizza! Only ones in the place the whole time we were there during lunch! Have to admit it is sort of remote!! The owner was friendly and we liked his pizza! Quite a few items on menu so may have to go back and try something besides pizza! Nice sit down area so plenty of room when it is busy! 2 tvs and not to loud!"}
{"text":"Omg Italian heaven! This is a hidden treat as a little tiny restaurant. It's a little like fast food and a little like a dine in restaurant.  You can order and dine in or carry out. They do bring your food to the table after you order at the counter. The prices are really reasonable for what you get and for the quality of food. The place doesn't look that great but omg the food. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Best pepperoni pizza I've ever had! Would not want to go to any other place. Love the owners and environment!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype.

I'm from Chicago, so good Italian food is a staple in our family. Upon reviews of this place from friends, I thought it was going to be my go-to, but sadly Taste of Italy is another mediocre desert restaurant.

The pizza was incredibly unimpressive. Greasy + tasteless. We ordered mozzarella sticks and they were soggy. Not to mention it's overpriced.

Still searching for that good Italian..."}
{"text":"The first time we heard about this little place, the person described it as \"a great little italian place\" My husband and I both envisioned a dark dinning room with waitstaff. When we arrived, it turned out to be a little Pizza joint. That didnt stop us, cause someone highly recommended the place. We were just thrown off, when the description of the place was the opposite of what we were expecting. Any ways,  Other It was not at all what we were expecting, It is a place that I crave. The Pizza is deiciouse, and the wings, are like small resaurant wings with the butter style sauce, which I Love. I am an Arizona Native, and this is the kind of wings my family grew up on. I have stopped in a few times on my way home from work just to pick up some wings. I live in Buckeye, but I have their number on speed dial, so I call my order in ahead of time and its ready when I arrive. The owner has been there each time I have visited and seems friendly, I mean he is a business man, trying to earn/keep a customer base, But he really seems passionate about his company and the food they prepare. I love the food here!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a BBQ restaurant, and I ran across Taste of Italy. This must be the BEST mistake I have ever made. The food is exceptionally GREAT. You must try the cannoli...I am visiting Goodyear from LA county. I would almost drive from LA to eat here again. 

It's a good thing, I don't live close or I might get too big to fit in the door!"}
{"text":"When you think of Italian food you think of Olive Garden. This place will take your expectations to a whole new level! It's a definite win for a foodie and a  phenomenal meal for the average fan."}
{"text":"The one thing I notice about the pizza in this town is that its all the same. I can name at least four different New York Style (big slice) pizza joints in Goodyear and they all taste about the same. This place has a bit more foot traffic than the rest of them but is nothing special to me. The prices are average; the service is average."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my way home from work and got some hot wings to snack on at home. The owner was really sweet and chatted while I waited. Before I left he gave me a free soda since it was so hot outside and I didn't have A/C in my car :) 
Once I got home I dug into the wings and man they were so good. Lots of wing sauce and easy to eat! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  Family owned and absolutely the best pizza.  Great food and great price!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after passing it while we drive so many times. We haven't tried their pizza but we had chicken parm and fettuccine Alfredo. Both were tasty. We got an order of breadsticks that I wouldn't recommend. They weren't anything fantastic and not worth spending the money on. They need a flavor glaze or something on them to spice them up a bit.  

Employees are friendly and the seating area is clean."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 Stars just for the great service we received.  I came here with my kids after we left a class in Estrella and we ordered the Extra Large Pizza Special with 20 wings.  Everything came out hot and fresh and the wait wasn't long at all.  When our food came to the table we had a pepperoni pizza and 10 BBQ and 10 Mild wings.  My little boy stated, \"I wanted cheese pizza.\"  Without a blink the guy who delivered our food brought back 1 slice of cheese pizza!  Such great customer service.  Everyone here was very nice and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Meh. I've been to Italy for 112 days, New York for 15 days. Some reviews about being so authenic are a little strong. Stromboli was good, Spaghetti was horrible, cheese sticks were great, garlic knots were tiny. Service by one young man awesome, the other terrible. I'd give it another shot at least, but I won't be thinking about."}
{"text":"I do not get the other reviews? This was no more than a fast food place. The pasta was terrible. The only good thing is it's prices. From the pictures and reviews I assumed it was a small sit down Italian diner. Wow was I wrong."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and I can say that this is the best pizza in the Valley.  It is exactly like the pizza you get in Italy.  The crust is crispy, the sauce is a beautiful balance of seasoning and tomatoes, the sauce to cheese to toppings ratio is perfect, and the price is just right.  If you don't live in the West Valley you will want to make the drive for this Sicilian owned family pizzeria."}
{"text":"The reviews were on point! We ordered more than we could eat on purpose. First time here and the food was amaze balls with marinara sauce! Margarita pizza had the perfect crisp at every bite and the mozzarella was fresh.  Garlic knots were lightly toasted and so good. The garlic? Yeah... extremely garlicy. We got a whiff as the server brought it over to our table. The fried zucchini chips were perfectly golden and tasty. They were flaky with a side of crunch.  We also ordered a cheese pizza.  Let me tell you, they didn't spare the cheese! The crust was thin just as we ordered it but the over load of cheese made the slices flop on the ends. No issues there either way.  Next time I may just ask for light cheese.  As you can imagine only a few slices of the cheese pizza fills you right up.   Parm cheese, oregano, garlic powder and crushed red pepper is available at every table.  The place is clean and the temperature was very comfortable considering that you can see the cooks doing their thing in the kitchen.   The cannoli --- my husband says was amazing. He didn't even talk while he was eating it. All I heard was crunch, crunch, crunch as he ate it. I've never had one. Maybe next time.  We had plenty of pizza left overs for later.  The location is worth the drive.  Good thing we live close by.  They have school special on the window.  Buy 2 slices and get a free 16oz drink M-F 10:30am to 3:00pm.  No price was posted on the window."}
{"text":"It is always difficult to accurately rate a place like this, so rounding up is better. The location and decor is average at best. It is in a lonely strip mall. 
They are not trying to reinvent any food, or food concepts. This is classic, family made Italian food. 

The pizza was good good the crust was perfect. The Fettuccine Alfredo was good. The meatballs were very flavorful. 
The highlight was the Calzone. While most Calzones  sound far better than they actually taste, this one delivers. It might be th e fact that no Marinera Sauce is cooked into the calzone. It is served on the side. This made the crust very crisp. The Italian Sausage was a great choice for a filling. 

The staff did a great job. Friendly and helpful as we had numerous questions about the food. 

We will definitely return when we come back to the area."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza several times but last night was the first time we actually went into the location for dinner.  It was a Sunday night and not too busy.  We ordered a meatball sub, fettuccine Alfredo and eggplant parm.  All were delicious, their marinara sauce is so yummy and you can taste the love!  The staff is SO friendly, you can tell it's a great working vibe there and the food was really good and a good deal.  We are definitely going to be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the west valley! Super friendly people that really know how to cook! Try their calzones they are better than any you've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food and have eaten it at so many places across the country! I live here in Goodyear and then in Dallas half the time. There has been no other place that is comparable to this precious little mom and pop, authentic Italian food I've ever had! Every time I'm in for a cheat meal, this is where I go!

Not only the food is great but, the staff make it even better! If you order more than once they always know your name and order! I just cannot say enough great things about this wonderful place!!"}
{"text":"I was told by family when I came out to visit from CA that this was a great place to eat. To me it wasn't. Let me walk you through the steps
1. Great customer service by the lady at the register.
2. Pizza was great hands down.
3. A bald worker there and another guy with a goatee got into it a lot while I was eating. 
4. The two gentlemen were swearing and the F word went around a lot. There were kids in the establishment as well. 
5. Their arguing and swearing ruined my appetite halfway through my meal and I kept looking back at the kids in the joint hoping they didn't hear what they said.
6. When I travel to AZ again I will not be eating here. 
Do not eat here"}
{"text":"Like a taste from the Northeast 

I think of myself as a Italian food aficionado (remember I am self proclaiming here) so I have admit I enjoyed a Taste of Italy when I 
visited.  

I think my favorite entrée on the menu may have been the Italian Anti Pasta salad.  The anti pasta salad  is enough for 2 or 3 people, however, the last time I visited a Taste of Italy  I literally at the entire anti pasta salad myself.

In addition, to my salad I ordered the calzone special with pepperoni, sausage,meatball, mushroom , green pepper, ricotta, and mozzarella cheese.  The calzone was absolutely delicious. The calzone was served with a golden brown crust and stuffed with fresh ingredients. 

Service at a Taste of Italy is truly great.  The staff is very attentive, friendly, and accomdating.  Our  drinks/water were never empty and the food is reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"Taste of Italy is a bit out of the way but it is definitely worth the trip. Their Calzone is very good!  Crust is crisp and not soggy. Filling is very generous and oozing with cheese. Their pastas are perfect. Sauce isn't too acidic. And the best part about all the good food is that their prices are so reasonable."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday afternoon. Had a wonderful experience here. Food was very tasty, hot and fresh ingredients were used. The bread was fresh and tasted just right. I had the lasagna which to me was one of the best dishes I have ever had.
Reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Ingredients are not extravagant but the flavors are great. The owner is friendly and inviting really enjoy the food and the experience return often."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I order an Xl pepperoni pizza 10 hot wings and a 2 liter of soda. They said it will be 45 mins for the delivery it took over an hour and they forgot my soda. I called back to get my soda and the guy had a total attitude with me was very rude and not helpful AT ALL!!!!! They have horrible horrible customer service in never using them again!!!! Would not recommend anyone to this place unless you want to be treated like a piece of trash on the road!!!!"}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza and a nice staff. Their menu is extensive."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite things about thiis place: 
Perfectly thin, crisp crust! 
Fresh mushrooms (not canned). 
Generous topping application. 
Non pizza options: Stromboli, pasta and heroes/subs. 
Local!"}
{"text":"This is about as authentic as it gets. Italian people cooking authentic Italian meals. Red sauce tastes delicious and the staff is very courteous. Not one of those chain restaurants, looks like its a small restaurant with attention to detail. Loved it."}
{"text":"The family wanted to try a new pizza spot in Goodyear and we gave this tasty spot a try. I ordered take out and upon arrival the pie was ready as promised. Owners were on sight and very friendly. Once home, I busted out the pizza pie, wings, and our order of garlic knots. Initial appearance was mouth watering and the aroma was on point. The fact that I was starving did not hurt my initial assessment. For the grub, the family enjoyed the pepperoni pizza. The crust and sauce were very good. The toppings could have been more evenly distributed but that is being picky. The medium heat wings were good and the ranch provided was great. Glad to see they do not water down their ranch. Also, the price of .25 cents a piece is well priced. The knots were yummy and again, the tomato sauce was very good. Overall, we enjoyed the meal and with a total price of under $30, I can not complain."}
{"text":"The people here are really nice and the food I feel is priced right. I get a pizza and wings.  Will continue coming here. Wish it was closer for me. Looking at the below pictures is making me want to try other things."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but customer service could improve. The people at the counter usually seem distracted or in too much of a hurry to be overly friendly. We still go back for the yummy food and it's really convenient for take out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. The people were very friendly. I had the chicken parmigiana and it was excellent. My gf had the fettuccine alfredo chicken. She loved it. They were really busy and the pizzas coming out all looked delicious."}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced.  Pizza looked good.  We had pasta and loved it."}
{"text":"We were in the area looking at homes in Verrado and used Yelp to search for nearby restaurants. At first glance this appears to be a busy family pizzeria. We placed our order and sat down. The Margherita pizza was crispy but the sauce tasted like the same sauce that is used for their pasta, the mozzarella was a little sparse as someone else mentioned, and the big no-no was the use of dried basil. A little pricey at $17. 

The other huge factor in my rating was the service. We had to ask for everything, including a pizza server, and they gave us a cheese grater! The waitress answered everything very curtly and never asked us if everything was okay, despite asking and attending to everyone else's needs around us. I literally heard the next table being asked four times if their food was okay and if they needed anything. I am not sure if you get anything for free when you dine in as another reviewer mentioned, because we didn't receive anything. I do not like to frequent places where they have a major attitude or are cliquey. I would not return here again nor recommend this to anyone. I can usually overlook surly service if the food is excellent, but in this case, not even the food was up to par."}
{"text":"Much better than the one up the hill. Thanks for having good Italian food so I don't have to visit Olive Garden. Pizza and wings deal is yummy. The whole family enjoys taste of Italy."}
{"text":"After my wife had major surgery, her first trip out of the house in two weeks could have been anywhere.  She chose Taste of Italy.  You may sell great pizza and pasta, but you serve memories for family and friends.  

Thanks for making my wife's difficult life much nicer today."}
{"text":"I had the steak, onion, cheese sub and a square deep dish pizza. The sub bread was very stale the steal tasted bland I had to add salt and spaghetti sauce to make it edible. The pizza bread was way over done to greasy but the red sauce was really good, and the toppings was yummy."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and Cannoli's.  

Wife had Toasted Ham and Salami sub and I had 2 pieces thin crust pepperoni W/Extra pepperoni. 

 We ordered breaded fried Zucchini and I had Garlic Bread with real garlic and cheese.  we ended up ordering 2 Cannoli's to go because we couldn't finish all the food:)
The marinara sauce was excellent.  Restaurant was Very clean and owners talked to us and helped us order.

We look forward to going back and trying the Pasta.



~$24 for 2 with 2 appetizers...very reasonable.

Try this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for very casual Italian dining with excellent food and good prices.  The lunch special can't be beat. It is difficult to decide what to order as there are so many good dishes.  I have had food delivered to my home and my family loved it. The staff and owners are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"They have great pizza for a reasonable price...we always get the sicilian pizza because I have 2 teenagers that love to eat pizza. We always have plenty left over. They also serve beer and wine for a good price....a \"mug\" of wine for $5, what a bargain!! Everyone here is always friendly, give them a try and support this local pizza place!! They also now have delivery!"}
{"text":"I found this place on accident for lunch with the bf before shopping and I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and their special slice pizza. Both were delicious!!! The Alfredo sauce was on point and you could tell it was homemade. My pizza slice was flavorful and the dough was crispy, just how I like it. My bf got the steak special sandwich which he devoured. My meal also came with bread with butter and a salad which was refreshing! I liked this place so much we came back again and I ordered the penne pasta with vodka sauce which tastes amazing!!! So glad I found this place! I wish there was one on the east side.
The owner and his staff are also very kind and easy to talk to. Support local businesses! You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Wonderful family owned and operated authentic Italian  food. Amazing prices and top quality food. We had a variety of pasta dishes and calzone. All 5 stars!  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Got a sicilian style pizza. It was pretty good. We dont live in Goodyear but took it to a family members house and we all enjoyed it.  Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"awesome authentic italian food. I come here on the regular! Their manicotti is the best i've ever had and their stuffed shells are super delicious"}
{"text":"You will not be sorry you came. Delicious entrees, friendly owners, and the best Sicilian pizza! My favorite is the Margherita Neapolitan pizza - just love hand-tossed crust! Everyone is family here!"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place. Food and service are good. The prices are kind of high for what it is. I wish that they had more specials."}
{"text":"FOR SHAME. Sorry but delivering 1 hour past their delivery estimate  ... And after I called to find out where my order was .. Is not something I'll ever try again. Oh and the manager demanded full payment too. They have a policy that if it's not hot it's free, but they also have ovens in the cars ... this is dishonesty lightly veiled as customer care. Wait it gets worse ... I turned him away at the door and was driving out to go get some drive-through food, when I saw my 13 year old son give the driver $$ for it while I was leaving - their driver took $30 from a 13 year old kid even after I refused him. He was driving away when I learned my son gave up his own cash. FOR SHAME!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday afternoon for pickup for pizza.  We had called in our order shortly after noon for a XL cheese pizza along with and order of garlic knots and were told our order number and that it would be 20 minutes.  At right around the 20 minute mark we arrived to the Taste of Italy Elliot Rd location.  Whenever I told the girl behind the counter my order number and that it was to go she let me know that they didn't have any to go orders and that I probably called their other location.   She was very nice about it and told me they were ten minutes away and gave me directions.  Whoops, I am clearly not from the area and that's what I get for just seeing a S. Estrella Parkway address and assuming where that was.  In any case I jumped in the car and arrived at the  proper Taste of Italy location about 10 minutes later.  Whenever I walked into the restaurant I was gruffly greeted by a gentlemen who took my order number and the proceeded to make a call on the phone.  While he was doing that an older gentlemen came out of the back and helped me.  He told me how I came at the right time for the pizza and garlic knots constantly moving around in the back all while the other gentlemen proceeded to stand at the register and play on his phone.  It was a disparity between good customer service while the other person working there could care less.  In any case I quickly had my order and was heading home.  Like all pizzas this one can be broken down into its three major components: cheese, sauce and crust.  The cheese on this pizza was ok and had good coverage across the pizza.  While it wasn't as good as some cheeses I have had it wasn't as bad as others.  The sauce on the pizza was actually the pizzas biggest letdown.  While my wife seemed to like it I thought it was rather bland and could have used more spices like their garlic knots dipping sauce.  Last but not least was the crust of the pizza which I thought was its best attribute.  It was a thin crust and was cooked nicely in the middle (still bendy) while having a nice crispy crust.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  While I don't think this was an amazing pizza it was satisfactory and did its job."}
{"text":"Yet again taste of Italy lives up! I got my pizza earlier than promised and cooked to perfection! The delivery woman was super sweet and courteous and even helped me close my door. My pizza is amazing... So amazing I ate some before I took a picture... I'm never going to Barros again; Taste of Italy officially has my heart!"}
{"text":"My boys LOVE going to \"Dino's\" place for pizza and wings. The food is as close to authentic New York pizza as you can get this far from Manhattan. We are die hard fans!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker visiting AZ, was very doubtful about pizza and pasta out here... But the chicken parm was great, great sauce, and the pizza looked very NYish..."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the west valley. The business is family owned and operated. They are true Italian-New Yorkers. 
My family and I celebrate my moms birthday here every year. we have over 30 guests and the help seat us all. They are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around!! I am very picky, but every time I go tho pizza is the bomb! Must try pizza in Goodyear. It's always freshly made and has a great taste"}
{"text":"Good to-go pizza, decent wings, friendly service. Great for a last minute meal or lots of mouths to feed. Delivery guys are always very pleasant, too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were trying to find a place that could compare to Slice of New York Pizza in San Jose, CA but we were disappointed. We ordered a x-large pizza at Taste of Italy and it was good but nowhere near as delicious as Slice of New York in California. Their X-large was was not even that big. At most it can be considered as a large. We also ordered their zucchini and they were ok. I would stick to your local pizza restaurant if you have one near you. Their service though was good. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Just wish their pizza could be tastier."}
{"text":"We are new to the area.  The pizza here was so good. We ordered crispy crust and light sauce and cheese. It came perfectly prepared.  The meatballs, sausage and jalapeno was so tasty. We will be back soon.  Great food at a great price. Thank you"}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Parmesan . They serve it with Penne pasta instead of spaghetti . We really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My youngest son loves NY style pizza. We were in NYC this summer and he ate giant slices of pizza non stop. this place has the closest thing to true NY style pizza around. everything else is home made, the sauce, the salad dressing (even the ranch), the pastas. I got a calzone and swear it was as big as my head. I know good Italian (growing up italian) and this is it. If you want good Italian at a good price in a laid back atmosphere this is it. Mind you, this is NOT Sunday dinner at Grandma's Italian, that's Bella Luna. This is the place you go for pizza, calzone, salad, eggplant parmigiana sandwiches, etc. Its NYC style Italian and its damn good."}
{"text":"So disappointing it tasted like one of those sandwiches wrapped in plastic that you would get it the deli in Walmart

No exaggeration try for yourself lots of bread little meat less flavor

Truly disappointed"}
{"text":"This is the place we get our pizza from when its pizza night. It tastes good the people are friendly and the price is not bad at all. Since we have moved out here my husband craves Angie and Jimmies and that is too far to go to. So after passing Taste of Italy many times and smelling the aroma coming from that building I swore to myself we are going to try it. Once we did we were hooked. We did try other places in the area but non are like this place. My brother in law came to stay for us with a while and when he did I swear he wanted to order from there almost every night. eeeek good for Taste of Italy but bad for us lol. We had the baked Ziti a while back and that marinara sauce is sooooo good. The fried zucchini is really good too. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Best White Pizza around to compare to New Jersey style pizza!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic, family-owned, Italian restaurant.  Everything tastes authentic (New York Style) and is made where you can see their shining kitchen, and served by friendly folk.   So happy to find such a warm place to greet others and enjoy a 'feast'.   Gus and his entire crew work hard, smart and with customers in mind.   Total comfort and satisfaction.   Enjoy the cannoli....best around!

Can't wait for the holidays to pass so I have 'room' to return.  We love their pizza (though it is thin, and we are 'deep dish' lovers) and their pasta meals are to-die-for!"}
{"text":"This is now my go-to for Italian food in the area.  Small place, in a strip mall, no pretentiousness.  Pizza, pasta, salad, soda, etc.

I get their baked ziti and love it.  My friend gets the spaghetti with meatballs and also really enjoys it.

My only complaint and warning would be to stay away from the cheesecake, no matter what.  Maybe it was a fluke, but when we had it, it was like it wasn't fully cooked.  The graham cracker crust didn't taste at all like graham crackers, it was more like sugar crystals.

It was just so wrong.  I've had cheesecake from coast to coast--it's my favorite dessert.  So take my word on this one, avoid the cheesecake at all costs!"}
{"text":"The Calzones are to Die for, their sauce is straight Up New York...!   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is awful!  I truly can't believe anyone would give it any more than one star.  It was so bad, my husband, who like Mikey, eats anything, wouldn't even take the leftovers home.  Go to Pizzeria Bianca instead.  You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"First time ordering we got BBQ wings and the white pizza with a bunch of toppings. Price was very reasonable with delivery and everyone was very nice. Pizza was great! Only 4 stars for now till I try their red sauce pizza."}
{"text":"We tried Taste of Italy with no expectations. The wings were not mind blowing. We did enjoy the rest of the meal. The garlic knots were good. I had the chicken parmigiana. I have to say that I am very excited to find a place on the west side that knows how to do it. I can not think of another place in the Avondale area that can compare. It was cooked very well, and was given just the right amount of marinara and cheese. Not to mention it cam with a salad and bread for just under 10$. Excellent value. We will be going back."}
{"text":"My son had mentioned that someone had made a remark about how good the food was at A Taste of Italy. We went out to dinner tonight and decided to look for it.  I ordered lasagna, my grandson ordered stuffed shells, & my son ordered fettucine.  All was good until my son was putting his fettucine in a to-go container.  He said I think I'll leave my fettucine after all & was looking at the bottom of the bowl.  I asked why & he said, \"look, there are a couple of hairs on the bottom of the bowl!\"  I told him, \"let them know.  That's not good\"  He walked up to talk quietly to one of the girls at the counter to show her & to let them know. The next thing I knew he was talking to an older guy, who must have been the owner.  He was showing the hairs in the bowl to him & I heard the guy start being sarcastic, saying, \" noone has short brown hair here.  What do you want?  Do you want your money back?\"  He was sarcastic and rude.  My son told him , \"no I don't want my money back.  I just wanted to let you know. You are really rude.\" My son & grandson walked out & I walked up to the counter to speak to him.  I told him that he was very rude & the least he could've done was apologize to him.  My son had walked back in at that point & agreed with me, telling him I didn't come up to tell you, just to get my money back.  I just thought you'd like to know\"  He left his fettucine he'd started transferring into a foil container there on the table.  He told me in the car that just thinking about it made him want to throw up what he did eat.  Sad that none of the workers or owner couldn't offer an apology until we told them that they should!  Even sadder that he didn't offer to give us a refund with the exception of  when he was yelling at my son at the beginning, saying \"what do you want?  You want your money back?!\"  Horrible customer service skills on top of poor hygiene practices.  By the way, the \"cook\"  does have short brown hair ( a fade).  Don't go there unless you want to eat things that don't belong ib your food!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza from a real Italian. Came here after a spring training game. Small nice interior."}
{"text":"After my sister got stuck at work late and I had nothing made for dinner I decided to order pizza to be delivered. I've visited Taste of Italy multiple times and have always been a fan of their pizza. When I called the girl answering the phones was not friendly, she also seemed to have a problem with her hearing. I gave her my address multiple times, spelled it out multiple times, she assured me she had it correctly. She informed me it would take 45 minutes to get my pizza delivered, which I wasn't thrilled about but I understood. After 44 minutes went by I got a call from the pizza delivery driver asking again for my address, the girl answering phone orders did not have my address correct at all. He then told me my order would be delivered in 25 minutes. WHY? Upset I called Taste of Italy to ask why my order was going to be an additional 25 minutes later than I was originally told. The same girl answered the phones yet again in an extremely unprofessional manner seemed to not know why it was going to take longer other than \"he just left\" I live 10 minutes form this restaurant. I asked to have my pizza delivered first and immediately, as I would have just picked up the damn thing myself had I know it was going to take OVER AND HOUR to get it delivered. The pizza took a total of an hour and 5 minutes to arrive. The girl answering phones treated me as if it was my problem and even argued with me about where they were located from my sisters house. I have never been treated so unprofessionally. As if the phone service wasn't bad enough, the pizza arrived COLD. If I didn't have starving kids excited about pizza I would have returned it. Do yourself a favor and pick something up from the grocery store, they'll surely treat you a lot better and won't charge you 40$ for 2 pizzas."}
{"text":"Door said open at twelve but its open at eleven. Walked in at 11:40, asked if it was open and the guy said \"the door is open isn't it?\" Once that was settled and we had the food we were happy. Got two steak hoagies, wings and fries. All three things were great."}
{"text":"I use yelp all the time but have never written a review until now. Taste of Italy is one if our favorite places to eat whenever we are in GoodYear. They are always very nice food is awesome and the place is very clean. Went there tonight had an awesome dinner as usual. Went to leave and our vehicle wouldn't start. Dead battery and no jumper cables around. The owners called someone and had them bring jumper cables to the restaurant so we could get our vehicle started!! How's that for customer service?  Give them a try you won't be disappointed. Their chicken Parmesan is my fav!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and love the food. We have always had a great experience dining in as well as picking up dinner. We always receive a friendly greeting. The menu has classic Italian dishes which are made with the best ingredients. You really have to try everything on the menu because everything is so good. The wings are nice and meaty."}
{"text":"Great place with good pizza. The wings taste great but they are a little on the small side"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Italian food. I recommend it to anyone that is tired of the big chains.."}
{"text":"This restaurant was super clean and presentable. The servers were friendly and helped us through the menu. Our pizza was delicious, the crust was crispy which a thin crust should be, the ingredients were fresh, and the sauce was phenomenal. Overall this was place was super good and clean. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I wish I could say my experience was better. We had ordered take out, the XL Pepperoni Pizza and wings combo. We order a Pepperoni Calzone as well. For the wings we order medium and hot. We received mild and medium, and they were each the size of my husbands pinky finger. He's a thin man so that says a lot. The wings looked like they were taken from a baby chicken and then deep fried for about 10 minutes longer than they should have been. They were awful and for 20 wings we got 2 small sides of ranch, one was half empty, and my morher in law finished the 1 full ranch cup with 4 wings. The calzone we ordered to have Pepperoni, I started eat and only got cheese. The last bite has a small cluster of Pepperoni. Talk about disappointing. We will definitely not be coming back, and stick to going to Barros."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with delicious food served fast and fresh. 

The pizza tastes just like it did when we were in Brooklyn. 

Order up front and they will bring it to your table. Reasonably priced. 

Not just pizza. Several Italian dishes just like Mama's."}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place.  The thin crust pizza is a great, New York style.  The bread sticks are awesome, and even the calzones don't disappoint."}
{"text":"So that age old question of.... What are you in the mood for? I told my husband pasta. We stopped considering O. G. pasta several years ago.... So he found this place and said up to try something new? So at first glance there weren't many cars in the lot but inside was quite full. So I must admit I was hesitant. We ordered our food and paid then took our seats. My son and I ordered fettuccine alfredo and my husband got chicken parm. We even ordered a slice of cheese pizza for our daughter. The salads were great the house dressing was amazing.... The bread was good. I'm super impressed and we will most definitely be back!!! Their alfredo was fresh and light and creamy. I cleaned my plate and my craving for pasta was satisfied and then some!!! Give them a try. You won't be sorry you did! We sure aren't."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Best wings around. Great prices and very tasty food. We have been twice and will be going back for sure. Our new favorite."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem that everyone should try! I'm from the east coast and recently moved to the west coast but couldn't find any good pizza shops.  This pizza is thin ceust, packed full of flavor, and delicious. The prices are also decent so we have found our pizza place for life."}
{"text":"So I went in to this place a couple of days ago because my neighbor said it was amazing. I'm not easy to please especially when it comes to Italian food. After dining here it's safe to say that it's one of the best mom and pop Italian restaurants  that I've been too! This is coming from a guy who has eaten at many Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. Arizona had a very short supply of these great tasting restaurants. So if you're ever in town and looking for a great Italian restaurant eat here. Service was great you can get a great sense of the hard work and love that Dino (owner) has put into this place. Wings are delicious  and for you anchovy lovers  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in the valley, the pasta is great!! Service is awesome, hot fresh food and quality ingredients. Crispy crust, perfect sauce, and great toppings."}
{"text":"Very easy for this review. I'm from Brooklyn, they're from Brooklyn. This is NY Style Pizza, end of story. If you want NY Pizza in the west valley. Here it is!"}
{"text":"This pizza was nothing special. It reminded me of middle school cafeteria pizza. The cheese was underwhelming, the sauce was bland and did not blend well, but if you buy it for your kids under 8 years old, it's fine."}
{"text":"I've recently tried out their meatball spaghetti one night and sausage spaghetti another and a slice of cheese pizza. I love spaghetti so it's hard to not enjoy it, but their sauce is pretty good. I did enjoy the sausage one more than meatball. Their service very friendly and you never wait forever for a meal. I do suggest for others to try out."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Wings! & service! I went here with boyfriend who is a very picky eater. Shockingly he ate and loved everything we got there! Definitely a place I recommend! Good deals. Pizza is huge! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had the pizza and it was just ok. Maybe it's the style but the crust seemed a little hard to me plus it was on the expensive side. I think there are better pizza places in the area. I would like to try some of the other option sometime."}
{"text":"I live 2miles from here & I finally came to try out their pizza.....Why didn't I come here before this pizza is excellent.... Will make this my new pizza place...overall the place is really clean & the owner actually greets the customers; which I thought was pretty cool, makes you feel right at home....wow is an understatement.....must try this place their prices are not bad.."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when I had to get my car fixed. And went back again when I took the car back, again.
Good pizza, tasty sauce and crust.
Had a pasta dish and again the sauce was great, fresh mozzarella.
Decent wings, but for the price, they're good.
I'll be back, even of my car isn't broken."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is excellent and the service is even better. The owner gives us something for free every time we come in and always remembers us. My favorites are the baked ziti and eggplant rolitini. YUM! We ordered this when my sister came to visit and she couldn't say enough good about it!"}
{"text":"Just OK food, not great. Sandwiches dry and bland. Guys working there seemed unfriendly. Been there twice, same experience both times. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great family owned and operated business. I love their veggie pizza. Friendly service."}
