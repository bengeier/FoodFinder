{"text":"Not that great... food missing taste and presentation... service is slow, a bit sloppy and pricy for what it really is(25$ week days and 30$ week-ends)...been here, tried it... NEXT !"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food was amazing and the service was quick. General Tao, sesame beef, and the rainbow sushi were all amazing. The concept is all-you-can-eat but you order from the menu and they bring it fresh to the table"}
{"text":"Food is average, especially for the price. Small quantity too. Service not terrible, I wasn't done with my soup and the girl just took it away without saying anything!!! Go somewhere else if you want to have nice Asian food. You won't find it at Sato & Chan."}
{"text":"Horrible, dégueulasse.  La pire bouffe chinoise que j'ai jamais goûté dans ma vie!

Soupe won ton pas de goût

Viande pas cuite

Dumping a le goût exactement comme le play-doh!

Jamais plus!"}
{"text":"This place looks decent on the outside but it's just a front!
We were seated and the waiter did not take our drink order - didn't ask. We had to ask for them!  We ordered our food on a photocopied piece of paper - we ordered about 10 items but only received 7 of them and 2 of them were incorrect!  We ordered noodles and got ribs, we ordered sushi and got chicken!  It was a really horrible experience!  When we told the waiter he shook his head and said \"oh sorry\" and walked away!!!
When we first walked in I let the host and and hostess know it was my husbands birthday. They assured me they would bring over a slice of cake w/candle. Didn't happen. Do yourself a favour and skip this one. I can't remember the last time I had such bad service. Oh and BTW the carpets have never been cleaned!"}
{"text":"Service exécrable : la serveuse était surprise que nous ne prenions pas le buffet à volonté et nous a demandé si nous comptions rester longtemps - le restaurant était vide... Nous avons commandé une soupe aigre-piquante : concoction visqueuse et fade; des légumes mélanges : servis dans un sirop épais et sortis tout droit du micro-ondes; du poulet au citron: servi dans une panure épaisse et baignant dans une sauce sucrée sans relief, il était sec et tiède.
Je ne pensais pas qu'il était encore possible de manger si mal  dans un restaurant asiatique : Sato & Chan relève le défi."}
{"text":"Great food!  !!!  Great price!!!!   Fast service           ......good ice cream for desert!!!"}
{"text":"What a concept; a sitting buffet à $25 per head and that does not include any drinks, including the non-alcoholic ones.  Note that the non-alcoholic drinks are not mentioned in the menu, at all.

Service is slow; the appetizers are served at the same time than the entrees; the General Tao chicken and Sesame beef are served cold; the dumplings are overcooked; the Phat Thai is tasteless...

Go to the pizza place across the street!"}
{"text":"Poor service, fat and tasteless food.
Everything was disgusting.
I will never go back there.
First time and last time for sure.
Even the fried sushis were cold..."}
{"text":"je n ai pas essayer les shushis car je n aime pas. Plusieurs choix de menu et service impeccable. je trouve cependant que leur prix sont un peu élever pour la qualité correcte de la nourriture."}
{"text":"Absolutely aweful! It took forever to order and when the food finally came it was extremely below average. And they \"accidentally\" forgot to bring the plate of tuna sashimi (the most expensive item on the menu). After asking the waiter about it, he said he didn't know what happened to it. Then the owner came to the table and asked me if I was sure I wanted it! It took over 45 minutes to get what I ordered. And not everything that was on the menu was available like the shrimp toast. Definitely will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"C'est un bon restaurants mais pour le prix sa vaut pas plus que 3étoiles. Le service est très moyen. Bonne propreté mais plusieurs chaises sont en mauvaise état et aurait besoin d'être réparé. La bouffe est excellente mais les sushis son bon sans plus. 

Bonne bouffe!  :)"}
{"text":"I saw their advertisement recently on tv.  I've told myself many times that I wouldn't do a buffet style dinner ever again since I try to avoid the sin of gluttony.  But on a lazy Monday night, I decided to give it a try.  Yes, I know I'm a sinner.  Anyway, it was a cold night but there's plenty of parking.  That's a plus on the convenience side. The decor was nice and ambiance quite relaxing.  I don't know why other yelpers were complaining about slow service.   The service was fine.  I admit the food wasn't incredibly amazing to the point that I would dream about it later.  However, the sashimi salmon that I ordered was fresh and nicely cut.  I pretty much tried a little bit of everything on the menu.  Some of the dishes were a bit too sweet for me.  However, overall it was a positive dinning experience.  I think I gained 5 lbs from that dinner alone!  Time to hit the gym."}
{"text":"First time eating here and probably the last. The place is nice and the food wasn't awful, a couple if items were actually pretty good. Unfortunately, however, the service was utterly dismal: we were \"greeted\" by people with long faces, who seemed annoyed they had to serve us and would rather be anywhere else; and worst of all, they constantly got our orders wrong: we received things we never ordered, never received things we did order... As a rule, it seems you either won't get more expensive items (meats, the higher end sushi) or will receive it in tiny quantities. 

For the price this is a very annoying practice, specially since a lot of the dishes were sub-par. 

All in all very disappointing and for the first time in my life I left absolutely no tip. The service was just that awful."}
{"text":"Commande à volonté qui est un buffet à volonté contrôlé avec l'avantage de pouvoir amener sa bouteille de vin. Le décor est joli mais il fait sombre.  Le prix pas cher: 25$ le soir. 

Les serveurs sont assez lents, peu de service ( il faut demander 3 fois la même chose(.  La vaisselle pas toujours propre. J'essuyais tout au passage.. 

Les plats en résumé c'est beaucoup de repas congelés réchauffés, beaucoup de sauce et de friture qui camouflent des ingrédients de qualité médiocre.  Il faut comprendre que c'est un buffet dans la cuisine et non un chef qui prépare au fur et à mesure. 

J'ai eu du plaisir à être en bonne compagnie mais ce n'est définitivement pas mon premier choix de restaurant dans le coin."}
{"text":"Il est ouvert depuis environ deux ans, il a pris la place du Mesa qui avait pris la place du Vergas. C'est à croire que les restaurants qui prennent pignon sur rue à cette adresse n'ont pas de chance. 

Déception total. Bon il est certain que je ne m'attends pas à grand chose sachant que c'est un restaurant du type buffet chinois. Mais tout de même... Nous avons été à l'heure du midi. Le menu est beaucoup plus restreint que celui du soir. Il est probablement préférable d'aller au Finesse d'Orient de l'autre côté de la rue. Bon, peut-être pas plus qu'un deux étoiles qu'en à lui mais c'est déjà plus q'une seule. 

Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"A recent sushi experience has had me swear off all you can eat restaurants, but sato and chan might see me go back on my word one day. 

It's your typical all you can order to eat kind of restaurant except absolutely everything I ordered was delicious. I had also starved myself for 24 hours to prepare for this so they could have served dry rice and I would have inhaled that also. 

My point is: I don't like all you can eat restos, but i kind of like this one. There's so much more than sushi that it's hard not to!"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much since its a sushi/schezuan place and they aren't usually fantastic .... But this place was very good. The beef & broccoli was super tasty, the fried squid was amazing, and the peanut butter dumplings were to die for. The sushi was fresh and perfectly made. I'd definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Thats a bad sushi place, i ate at hundreds of sushi restaurants and this one is among my bottom list. Sashimi was not fresh at all and thats dangerous , food was less than ok. A lot of choices but nothing special. The waiter was faceless, each time we ordered an additional dish we had the impression we were exceeding what the restaurant expected (as it is all you can eat menu) , anyway we were a group of 15 and i doubt any of us will return."}
{"text":"Sato and Chan gets a lot of dividing feedback and ultimately, it's with good cause. I've eaten here thrice (gave it it's chance to impress) and here is my opinion :

Pros :

- I love all you can eat buffets in the style they bring the plates freshly made from the kitchen directly to your table. They have upwards of 80+ items on their menu and going there in a group is a smart idea. Anywhere between 4 to 8 is great. They have a limited menu for lunch at a decent price as well.

- Can't decide on a cuisine? Well, they offer Szechuan as well as Sushi and Thai! 

- I love their peanut butter dumplings and spring rolls, they are very good! I also enjoy their Won Ton as well!

- The place looks really nice, the seats are comfy and spacious.


MEH :

- The sushi is below average. I like their Maki in particular but the rest is mediocre.

- The service was neither good, nor bad. They were slow but got the job done.

- The lemon chicken was good but they serve them in these tiny plates we barely got 1 piece each.

- They have ice cream included with the all you can eat menu, the options were limited to 3 popular favors and it wasn't anything special beyond what you'd find at a grocery store.


Cons :

- I'm really disappointed by their Sesame Beef and General Tao. The show starters! It seems like every place that makes these dishes wildly differ from one another and sadly, their General Tao tastes weak and completely different. The Sesame Beef is neither crispy nor tastes as it should. In fact, we couldn't even tell the difference between some other plates.... when the orange beef came, the sauce just tastes the same.

- This place remind me of Hot & Spicy from across the street that shut down last summer and it simply doesn't compare. I miss Hot & Spicy so much.

- The Mongolian lamb wasn't impressive at all.

- Their website has been up for a year and they still haven't uploaded the menu, what gives?

- The price tag for an all you can eat is over $30, kind of expensive for what you get.



In the end, Sato and Chan balances out as average but when compared to places no longer available, very mediocre. My search for great all you can eat Szechuan continues."}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with Sabrina L. 
The food is under average, especially for the prices they ask. 
Service? What service? My wife wasn't hungry so she went for the \"a la carte menu\" instead of the buffet. When the waiter brought my food, he insisted on me eating it alone not sharing it with her. That was pretty embarrassing considering he said it out loud and all the tables around us heard it. 
The only positive thing: decor is nice
Will not return."}
{"text":"Je ne cherche pas à être condescendant envers Laval, mais il n'existe pas de bonne raison d'aller là.

Des sushis à volonté y'en a des tonnes et celui-là a des têtes blondes et des annonces à TVA... mais rien d'autre. C'est de qualité buffet, le service est amical mais si mauvais. Mon serveur oubliait toujours tout et j'me suis levé pour aller chercher des trucs comme le wasabi ou les papiers de commande. 

Si on oublie les \"trucs chinois\" qui n'avait rien de chinois et qui au final étaient gluants, gras et trèèès fades. Un menu ultra américanisé, ce qui ne serait pas si mal si c'était meilleur. Les sushis sont de loin les pires. Wow... quelle déception. J'habite le Centre-ville et j'ai peut-être surestimer ce petit coin de déprime au nord-est du métro Montmorency"}
{"text":"Awful awful food and service! An insult to chinese/asian cuisine! Seriously! I figured, since it was featured in the chinese newspaper, it must somehow represent what we eat... but no... Not one dish was acceptable. They had a thailand style salad, which in my opinion should be made with something along mango, papaya, sweet and spicy... but it was chop suey with fish sauce and tiny bit of chili! the pineapple pork was all breading, goey sticky starchy sauce, bland, too sweet. there was no sushi available even though it is one of their most marketed menu item. And the service was beyond bad. Even though it is a all you can eat, after ordering the first time, they seem to try to ignore you as much as possible as soon as you try to order something else. We waited 30 minutes for a second round, abandonned and asked for the bill. Surprisingly, the bill came in fast enough.  I really do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
