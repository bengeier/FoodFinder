{"text":"This little \"hole-in-the-wall\" type \"turo-turo\" eatery is full of good food that just feels like a big hug from your Lola/grandma.  

The restaurant has a few tables and chairs to dine in but the business seems to do better with take out orders and party trays.  It's gets busy but the service is so friendly and quick.

Some of the best Filipino food I've had in the GTA."}
{"text":"Ummm so all my friends and family know that I am not the biggest fan of filipino food (though I am half Filipino) but I really need to commend this place for having some great options!

My mom usually goes for their hella real filipino dishes such as tokwa baboy, Kare kare, menudo, palabok and she really enjoys them. 

Dishes I've tried and really like are the okoy (or is it ukoy?), lechon kawali (tho I need to refry this at home cuz I hate chewy fat), crispy pata, and this dessert ball thing on a skewer (comes in 3).. I think it's called carioca. 

I always find myself calling them every weekend to see if they have any okoy (ukoy) left. So addicting!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the food is pretty unique if you haven't had much Phillipino food 
 
I ordered rice with two meats (beef stew, and chicken stew) the chicken was moist and in a tomato oil based sauce the beef was far better and more unique it looked almost like a curry but very different in flavor it had a  sweetness to it while still being salty and the beef was very tender 

All in all it was a good lunch and probably would return in the area"}
{"text":"Small Filipino restaurant filled with favorite usual comfort foods. Palabok, Kari Kari, bbq chicken n bbq pork skewers , ect. They also have deep fried shrimp topped fritters, turon (deep fried banana , still like the Turon from Canasia) , halo halo. 
Well staffed so service is fast, with ample varieties of food.  
Floors are greasy so becareful and limited seating."}
