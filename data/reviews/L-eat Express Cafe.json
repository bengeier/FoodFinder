{"text":"I'll get right to the point - The new front of house staff are rude.  Particularly the bearded man with the roundish glasses.  

I frequent L-eat once or twice a day to get a coffee (or the occasional tasty chocolate chip cookie), and have done since they opened.   I have always found the staff there to be kind friendly and warm.  I have been a staunch supporter of the business since day one and yet I have been treated rudely by this new employee (manager?) since the day he arrived.   Unfortunately he and one other lady (who isn't much better) seem to be the only two front of house people left.  As much as I have enjoyed the food here over the years, I do not feel welcome in this establishment any more and will no longer  support it. 

What happened to all the great front of house staff?"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were dry. Salads soggy. Service VERY slow. Would definitely not recommend coming here for lunch, or any time for that matter. What a Bagel is always a better bet for a reliably good sandwich, and speedy service."}
{"text":"I've been to L-eat several times and just realized that I've never reviewed them. I noticed a few negative comments on Yelp so I figured now was a good time to provide my positive experience(s). They're located near Adelaide/Spadina, and offer a wide range of salads, sandwiches and soups . L-eat is a good place for couples, co-workers and small groups. They have a number of tables, and comfy chairs to even accommodate ppl that are solo on their lunch breaks and want to chill on their own (or read a book!). Even though they don't offer a patio per se, they do have a massive sliding window to offer a similar effect (open on warm days!). My regular \"go to special\" is the ham and Gruyere sandwich. U have the option of having it grilled or not, and it's excellent! Equally important as the taste of the food, the staff are friendly and their service has been great during each of my visits!

A few notes: 
1) It's pricey! ($11.50 for a sandwich and bottle of water. Salads can get even more expensive as they're based on weight!) 
2) I've had the apples there a few times, and they seem to be older/ soft! Looked ok from the surface, but, tasted like it was from 1985! :(
3) They serve booze. Perfect for anyone seeking a liquid lunch or an escape from their office (perfect for Fridays!!)!  

Besides the apple experience, I'd still suggest that you check this place out (at least) once if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Yum yum, had a delightful margarita today, and a DELICIOUS vegetarian panini"}
{"text":"This place is as advertised: express.  

For the most part service is fast, not the happiest people in the world but fairly quick.  On more than one occasion I have been tempted to ask the staff to try and crack a smile, but then my coffee is usually ready so off I go.

Excellent Coffee
Amazing Ginger Molasses cookies
Fair price.
Really should have tried the ice cream sandwiches.
Efficient but grumpy service....and everyone where small black toques for some reason....weird uniform."}
{"text":"Great coffee but the to-go lids and cardboard things to keep your hands from burning are really cheap and flimsy. I couldn't stand getting my hands burnt and now go elsewhere for coffee. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Went here today to grab a late lunch. Decided to just get a salad as I wasn't feeling anything too heavy at the time. I got a greek salad but I wanted a different dressing so I asked the girl at cash if they had anything else. The house chef I'm guessing came out and gave me all the options. He ended up putting together a simple balsamic + vinger on the spot for me which was rly nice since that's what I normally prefer for my salads :)

Very friendly staff, salad was crisp and fresh. Wanted to try their special (pulled pork sandwich) but they were sold out. Might come back next time to see what other specials they have!"}
{"text":"Forget all of the nice things I have ever said about this place...It takes one bad meal to make me never want to return somewhere again. TODAY was that day.

I really wanted to go somewhere else where they have an amazing Wild Boar Fettuccine... but they were sold out.. so I decided that I would go to L'Eat to see what they have on special. They had some Beef, noodles and carrots on the menu for today.. unfortunately the price wasn't very presently displayed (I walked right by on my walk into the joint) so you can imagine my surprise when I got 4 small pieces of beef, a heap of over cooked noodles (and I opted for no carrots) and the price was around $13.. It's so appalling I will never be going back to this place again out of the sheer fact that I feel like I was just raped for my pay cheque over a less than mediocre meal.

The girl who worked there even commented when I made mention of the price and said \"I get that alot.\" As I mentioned before I'm ok with paying a bit for a GOOD meal but for something that tastes like sad leftovers, 

How depressing."}
{"text":"a friend and I stopped here while trying to kill some time before yelp party was supposed to start next door at the Herbal Infusion.

the case is very spacious and bright, modern design, friendly staff.

but the best part are few black couches in the far corner. I love cafes with couches!

also yummy biscotti tea! you have to try it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this cafe a few times now. It's quite good. The food is all fresh and made in house. They have a small selection of sandwiches and a handful of hot items you. It looks like the hot items change day to day. (I had a turkey shepherd's pie the last time I was there.) The food is all very tasty. Everything tastes super fresh. It's a pretty casual place. Service is cafeteria style. There is plenty of seating, and the restaurant is well lit by natural light during the day. I'd say it can be a bit pricey for lunch, but not out of line with other spots in the area. It's definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"Dear L'eat,

I liked you. I liked you enough to write a review in November, and I had mostly nice things to say about you. But honestly, I must have been under the influence when I wrote my last review! 

But after today ... never. again;

It's freezing out today, and was craving a substantial lunch. Something warm. And because I live across the street from L'eat, it seemed like the best option!

But boy, do I feel disappointed;

I walked in, and should have taken it as a hint when it's 2pm, and the hot meal of the day was still available .... 

I just paid $14 (YES. $14) for 1.5c of overcooked completely BLAND white rice sprinkled with frozen peas, a pile of mushy, under seasoned lamb and a few of those amazingly tasty cauliflower fritters, that are now completely mushy from the time they've been sitting too long. 

Please see photos I posted. 
I am not exaggerating when I say this is a terrible value.

I love local/small businesses, and locally made food, but this is insulting.
 
Why don't you cut down half of your restaurant and wasteful white counter space (it's usually only 10% full anyways!), save on lease square footage, and reduce your pricing?!?!?!


Sorry, L'eat. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the tasty soup at Leat.  The pizza is pretty good too.  I haven't tried too much of the other items because Im such a huge soup fan.  Only $3.00 too which is reasonable for home made tasty soup downtown.  I also love that they have the water available to get yourself whenever you need it.. free of charge.  If you are a soup fan and looking to enjoy a nice atmosphere and not pay a fortune downtown then Leat Express is your place."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review to support L'Eat because it was reported to be closed by some so-called Yelpers according to the app & website as of Feb.17, 2016; Yelp's data is so out-of-date compared to Foursquare/Swarm, so here's a review for y'all!

My main attraction to L'Eat is French press coffee.  Considering how many places like Starbucks and \"Le Gourmand\" we have in downtown Toronto, a French press coffee is difficult to find, especially when French sounding places have no French press.  Dark Horse is the only other place I know of, and my other favourite is Aroma's Turkish coffee.  There must be more, but I'm surviving with the few I know of.

L'Eat has decent food too, at decent prices - it's clean, and the staff are pleasant - you must try it if you love a French press like I do..."}
{"text":"After eating here a few times and having ordered catering here for large groups a number of times, I have to say I'm very impressed with the quality of food here.

Lunch downtown isn't cheap anywhere and I would say this is on par with what you would pay for lunch - around the $12 mark for a sandwich, drink and salad. I'm a fan of the make your own sandwich bar. One can't go wrong with fresh ingredients and lots of options like caramelized onions and countless different Ace bakery bread types. 

I've never eaten in, however the eating space is quite airy and large. Think modern cafeteria style seating.

Plus, the double chocolate chunk cookies with sea salt are to die for."}
{"text":"Twice i have ordered the Asian Chicken Salad with Mango and twice they have given me a salad without Mango. It's the main ingredient!
I emailed to let them know thinking it might be a mistake but they never bothered to respond.

Terrible service & food not as advertised.

Dont bother"}
{"text":"Overall this place is great!

What I like:
- the cookies are fu*%ing amazing. I eat one almost everyday
- the atmosphere is great for meetings. There is a lot of space in between tables
- the people are nice

What I dont like:
- the food can be a little inconsistent
- the prices are a little rich in some instances (e.g. not 100% fresh bread always)"}
{"text":"I keep giving this place another chance. Why? Because I like Sonam R and Matt M and they think this place is the tops. 

Well guess what? I still don't. This place isn't the pits, but it really hasn't matured into anything good. 

The make-your-own sandwich was only OK. Bacon shouldn't be cold, L-eat. It just shouldn't... especially if you're charging over $10. 

I concede your attractiveness and being a good place to take a morning meeting over coffee and pastries. But. Yeah. Nuhuh. 

PEPPER POINTS for the check-off-your-ingredients clipboards. Cute."}
