{"text":"This was my first time having Thai food and I'm now a fan. To begin with we were served A delicious vegetable stock soup, it was a surprise and of course that made it even better. It had small pieces of cucumber, cilantro, tofu, baby corn. It was perfectly seasoned. We then ordered the tempura veggies.  Wow! The tempura was light, and the sweet, hot dipping sauce complimented the veggies just right. There were carrot slices, my daughter's fav, broccoli onion and green beans , my new favorite way to eat veggies for sure! We then split an order of pad thai. It is supposed to have shrimp but I am not a fan so we requested them to be omitted. It again did not dissapoint, very good.  Very nice staff too!!! I will crave this place...that's how you know it's great!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow...The food was excellent. ... We had the Spring Rolls,  Beef Noodle Soup, and Pad Thai Noodles to go.. Amazing. .. Do yourself a favor and stop by, you won't regret it. .."}
{"text":"Love the padthai! Also the shrimp rolls.. So much food and very inexpensive. The service is also fantastic. My favorite Thai spot yet!"}
{"text":"I came in a little late almost toward closing so I ordered take out, got the pad thai noodle with tofu. Friendly employees, got water while waiting and the wait was alright not too long. Pretty big restaurant with over ten tables. Will come early next time to check out what else they have and stay to eat."}
{"text":"Great new lunch spot! Under new ownership. Restaurant is clean and the staff is super friendly. And most importantly the food is DELICIOUS! Our new spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Food and service both great. I had the basil fried rice and my friend had the chicken pad thai!"}
{"text":"Our weekly excursion here had 2 instead b take~out this time as it was rather l8 & we were 2 pressed 4 time 2 dine in. So we called our order in lastnight 4 pick~up. 

   We got our stand~by crispy veggie rolls (a must~have item every time) in addition 2 Vegetable Tempura 4 our appetizers, along w/ Pad Snow Pea, w/ Crab Fried Rice & Pineapple Curry w/ shrimp & 2 Boba's (Taro & HoneyDew) 2 go. 1derfully friendly & helpful phone etiquette which felt almost as nice as being accomod8ed in~house.

   Went 2 pick it up about 20 min l8r & everything was packed, & ready 2 go including napkins, plastic~ware & even some chopsticks 4 those who want 2 try the traditional way 4 a more cultural experience ~ Nice! He voluntarily accounted 4 everything that was ordered b4 payment & even assisted getting it out 2 the car (talk about above & beyond service esp 4 a take~out/pick~up order)! Rushed home, excited 2 b sampling more treasures 4 our palate.

   True 2 what we've consistently known from the beginning, all we scurried home w/ didn't disappoint. Our household enjoyed everything so much, there was hardly any talking between scarfing each item & savoring both Boba's, which were Exceptional as usual. Couldn't decipher which 1 we liked better, personally I'm not 'usually' a huge fan of HoneyDew... till THIS Boba (which is saying A Lot) so suffice 2 say, I'll b getting this again future visits & it's WOW~ness is now up w/ our fave flavors, which is most of them (almost saliv8ing writing about it now)! Lol

   The Veggie Rolls were Scrumptious as always & the Amazing Vegetable Tempura will now b joining the ranks along~side them as a staple 2 future visits/orders. This YUMMYness has battered broccoli, carrots, onions, green beans & pumpkin &  is such a complimentary blend of flavors, I'd eat an entree size portion (but alas, I know it's called appetizer 4 a reason). 

   They really loved their Crab Fried Rice which has real crab meat, eggs, onions, garlic & cilantro & wolfed down the Pineapple Curry Shrimp right after which has red curry paste w/ pineapple, shrimp, carrots & bell pepper in coconut milk. At 1 point they put some of both entrees 2gether, gladly inhaling it that way 2! My Pad Snow Pea=DELICIOUS w/ snow peas, water chestnuts, mushrooms, carrots & onions ~ ur choice of chicken, beef, pork or TOFU (the last of which, being what I had of course)! I esp Highly Recommend any of their Pad entrees, any1 who's had any vari8ion has raved about/talked about their taste~buds thanking them.

   So what else can I say that I haven't several Xs b4? EXCEPTIONAL Flavorful Quality food (& Boba's) w/ Generous Portions, fresh nutritional ingredients w/ dishes customized how u want &/or need 4 ur dietary regimen in addition 2 Exemplary service (especially when the Awesome head Super~Server guy is there). What's not 2 like, or in our household's case LUV? The only thing there is 2 1der is, what's the soonest I'll get 2 come back again..."}
{"text":"Good variety of lunch specials. I had the pad Thai with tofu which I enjoyed. It came with a side of veggie roll and a vegetable soup. We ordered the spring roll, and it was full of raw vegetables wrapped in rice paper. It was  light and refreshing and delicious. 

Decent place to go to if you ever have a craving for Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place looks like fast take out place . Small portion and expensive. food was ok staff was not nice compare to the Thai food in Scottsdale.this is place is meh won't go back !"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of pad thai, I just had to try this restaurant on 35th Avenue near  Northern which was near my old stomping grounds. I found their pad thai to be well-seasoned though a bit less dry (\"dry\" being a preferred style for some pad thai aficionados), and without the cloying sweetness found in this dish when served in some Thai restaurants. Plus, the serving is more generous than in several of the Thai eateries I've tried.The restaurant is modest and the seats in the booths are well-worn but serviceable. Service is friendly and the food relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"The food was okay.Like any other Thai restaurant . But the one for sure that chicken stay was weird. It didn't look like the picture.  It tasted like wanna be  chicken curry on a stick.  It's the first and last time at this place."}
{"text":"We wanted Thai so we decided to check out this place, we came in and ask to be seated, other than the couple that was already here the restaurant was pretty slow or maybe we came in a slow day. I order Pad Thai noodle, which came with chicken, and shrimps and my friend got green curry beef. The Pad Thai noodle was pretty flavorful and not too sweet just the way I like it, my friend also like the curry with beef which was great. She loved it. We weren't too hungry so we just took the rest home. The service was great and we didn't have to wait too long to get our food.  They also have lunch special and we will be back again to try their lunch. I will recommend this place to friend and family who are looking for Thai food or just wanted to try for the first time."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I had visited Karen Thai Cuisine since I don't live in that area. For this reason, I cannot make comparisons to any other Thai restaurants in that area.   I  only tried one dish: Panang Beef Curry, which came with a perfect amount of rice to accompany the amount of curry that was served. The serving size was good for the price, the restaurant service was fast and  friendly, and the food tasted quite good. 

They also offered Thai iced Tea which was prepared quite well and tasted good.

 I know a lot of people that own authentic Thai restaurants in different parts of Phoenix and the East Valley. If you are looking to find Thai food near Northern and 35th Avenue, I recommend checking out Karen Thai Cuisine if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This panang. Johnny, this panang. Oh my god, this panang. This panang is amazing! As prior reviews had indicated, the place was a ghost town and we were hesitant to eat away from the herd. Fortunately for us...  Yelp to the rescue. The price was low, the portions were generous, and the flavor was exquisite. Our server was on point AND out of the way and our dining experience was quiet and intimate. My daughter ordered the tea and I fell in love, my lady ordered some spring rolls and they were to die for. The panang was out of this world.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Spring roll was chewy and oily. Soup flavor profile was unbalanced presenting only as salty and sour...given Thai cooking is an art to balance all flavors it was very disappointing.  The kali lime leaves and lemon grass were in tiny pieces which made it unpleasant to rat since they are inedible and meant to be eaten around or fished out, I had to spit them out as I went which is unpleasant.  Nothing phenomenal or remarkable about this place. Very surprised by the high reviews. Just a hole in the wall place in a sketchy plaza, always a gamble to hit up places like this....sometimes you find a win and sometimes you just find meh. I found meh....especially the canned straw mushrooms which are a focal point of Tom Gha. Couldn't be anymore dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I love Thai food and it's the closest to my house. Finding ANY good restaurant in the valley is a challenge other than Mexican food obviously. I'm not sure what the raves were about. Maybe the owner or cook changed? My Pad Thai lacked the typical flavor and it had zero spiciness. It had a weird powder flavor and left a sour after taste. The noodles were overcooked to the point of almost mushy. Sorry, I won't be back to try any of the curries or soups."}
{"text":"100% authentic Thai cuisine. We have been all OVER the Valley as well as California we love food and have tried everything under the sun, this place was amazing and we will definitely come back, even our 4 year old gave this place a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Reminds us of our favorite place back home. Great food and friendly/happy staff!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food here, small mom and pop place with great family staff and food is good if you don't like spicy tell them so they can make it mild. Oh don't forget to check in to get your free Thai tea"}
{"text":"Got the free Thai Tea with check in. Didn't even drink half, it tasted bad. The tea was different than what I've had at other Thai restaurants. I like that I automatically got a water with my dine in experience. 

I was craving Pad Thai, so that's what I ordered. With tofu. It was quickly made and brought to my table. I also didn't finish this meal. 

The egg roll that came with it was mostly fried dough, a couple shreds of carrot. Very underwhelming. The Pad Thai was not spicy AT ALL. Which was disappointing, because that's what I love about Thai food, the spiciness! The tofu was squishy, the texture was just like eating a undercooked boiled egg. I've had tofu before, this was just eck... Speaking of eggs, there was egg's mixed in the noodles. I didn't like the noodles either, they were overcooked and I could've just swallowed then whole with how soft they were. Man! I've never been this disappointed of a ENTIRE meal before. And I have had Pad Thai before, I'll just go back to that other place next time.

At least the waitress was nice and apologized when she noticed I didn't eat much and I explained why. I quickly paid and got out of there, it's also not a great area. Actually saw a used needle in the parking lot, amongst other things I observed. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Being a fan of locally owned restaurants is a large part of what Yelp is all about. Here is a great example of a restaurant that is in a strip mall, locally owned, and under advertised. Karen Thai was recommended to us by a friend and we were not disappointed.

This place is casual, and maybe a bit pedestrian to look at. The seating is in booths with marble top tables, we were told to pick our own seat by the one and only service person that we saw. He promptly stopped at our table and asked us what we would like to drink. We got waters with an ice tea, it turned out to be their green tea on ice... it was a nice change to the standard tea. He did offer us a nice range of drinks including Thai tea, sodas, in general the usual list of non-alcoholic beverages.

We ordered the deep fried shrimp appetizer, We could have made a whole meal of them. The sweet chili sauce that they brought with it was as good as we have ever had. The shrimp were wrapped in wonton wraps, deep fried then delivered hot to the table. SCORE!

For the rest of our meal we split the Tom Yum soup, $9.95 was the price and you could select from Chicken, Pork or Tofu as the primary ingredient. We like the Tom Yum with seafood, it wasn't an option so we picked the chicken. We were delighted at the rich taste of the broth, the mushrooms were plentiful so overall it was filling. We ate till we were full, and did not order anything more as this had done it! We came home with more soup for snacks.

Having to use the restrooms was slightly less appealing, the restroom was clean but someone had left an empty container of hair grease in the bottom of the empty paper dispenser/mirror. They did have paper, just not in the one right in front of me. So maybe it was just a bit on the flukey side, but the lights were out when entering as well. 

We are looking forward to going back. The bill totaled $24 dollars so it is right in line with other Thai restaurants. This is not your best bet for a romantic evening, it was very nice as a family or casual spot to eat."}
{"text":"I got here just as they were closing and they still helped me out. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

I researched Mexican food restaurants in the area of my office and headed to one with great reviews.  But, just as I realized that that Mexican Food  restaurant was going to be a mile further than I had thought I saw the Karen Thai Cuisine restaurant.

Since Thai Food is among my favorite cuisine's I pulled in.  As I walked in my first impression with that the restaurant was larger than most Thai Food restaurants.  Then I noticed that half past noon on a week day, there was one single person seated in the entire restaurant.  I asked to see the lunch special menu but it was mostly just different types of fried rice.

So, I opted to order from the dinner menu.  I ordered one of my favorite Thai dishes Yum Nua or Thai Beef Salad.  Having lived in Thailand for six months, I'm very familiar with Thai food.  In fact, I've made Yum Nua hundreds of times myself.

The next thing I noticed was that the prices were a little high ($8.50 for a salad).  After placing my order, I realized that the waitress did not ask me how spicy I like my salad.  That was actually the very first time I was not asked that question ordering Thai food in the United States.  As I waited for my order I noticed that the decor was a lot of very dark woods and regimented booths.  There was almost nothing in the decor that was Thai or even Asian.

When I got my salad, I was unimpressed with the visual presentation.  It looked like a pile of mush with a wedge of Iceberg lettuce on the side.  With the first taste I was very disappointment with the spice level as it had almost no spice.  It tasted pretty much like it looked.  The beef was over cooked and not fresh.  The onions was mushy as if they may have been cooked in a wok.  The sauce was lacking in both fish sauce and lime juice.  There was no cilantro, mint, or cucumbers to be found.

For the record, Yum Nua should be thin sliced grilled beef (such as flank steak).  It is often prepared in advance and cold.  To  the beef, fresh chopped onions, shallots, cucumber, mint and cilantro are added.  It is then dressed with palm sugar, lime juice, fish sauce, and thai peppers.  Yum Nua is a classic dish of Thailand and I frequently order it as a barometer of how authentic a chef prepares food.

I was very disappointed with Karen's Thai Cuisine and can not recommend it."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been on this thai craze lately and since this place was close by us, we decided to check it out. We walked in and it was empty. We were the only ones in there besides the employees. We kind of wanted to leave but didn't want to be rude. Anyway we got three different dishes and samosa for our appetizer. The samosa was delicious! We almost ordered more but came to our senses. Our dishes arrived and they were dry. I'm used to saucy dishes to soak my rice in. This place not so much. I didn't even have a favorite dish because I disliked them all equally :(

The prices are cheap but they charge you for refills on your drink which is ridiculous. I won't be back. I was hoping they'd be good since they are so close but sadly I was disappointed. Oh well! On to the next!"}
{"text":"This place was the ROTD (Review of the Day) today - 7/16/14.  I saw the pictures and the other stellar reviews that made me crave Thai food all day long. I had to go and check out this place. No matter what.

So we made it for early dinner. Checked-in via Yelp before looking at the menu. Pops out a FREE Thai iced tea offer! #winning. Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of this dining experience.

We ordered 2 appetizers: an order of crispy tofu & an order of fish cake. This is sort of our standard test for Thai joints: how well they do their apps. Based on those 2: their grade would be C-. The tofu was not crispy at all and accompanied by an unappetizing sauce. The fish cake (tod mun in other places) was a bigger letdown - these were definitely store bought and not freshly made - sized like a dollar coin with a tough texture and was also paired with same sauce that came with the tofu.

We ordered the Tom Ka soup with chicken - we were worried that the server did not asked the spice level of any of our dishes so kinda expecting some Thai heat. This soup came in with a wimpy Level 1. For 10 bucks, definitely below the standards of the other Thai restaurants within the 10 mile radius.

For entrees, we had the Pad Thai (can't go wrong with that) - it was OK but again not mind blowing as the other reviewers were cheering about. The other entree was the Panang curry with tofu. This one was so soupy as the Tom Ka that when I  mixed it with the white rice, it was a BIG mess.

Sadly, the service was NO better than the food. We were the only ones in the place and I asked for everything. Can I have some plates please (after the apps were served)? Can I have some utensils please (only 1 fork for 3 people)? Can I get some water please? You get the drift...

Very disappointing meal. I guess I was expecting a lot given the rave reviews. Bottom-line, I was duped."}
{"text":"First, our waiter was very nice. He was very attentive, but I just didn't have the heart to tell him that the food was horrible. We got into the restaurant I ordered a thai iced tea which the tea was light orange and tasted like bad coffee. 

We then ordered spring rolls and chicken satay. The spring rolls only had two shrimp the size of quarters that were both freezer burned. Then the chicken satay was bright red? I usually get chicken satay and it is a tan color like chicken, but this was bright red similar to the color of a red pepper. 

We ordered two main dishes drunken noodle and pad thai. Both literally tasted like horse feed or as my husband said dog food. The shrimp again in the pad thai was freezer burned and I know because I have cooked with shrimp before that was freezer burned. We won't be coming back. We usually go to Siam Thai that is a few blocks west on northern but it was closed so we gave this place a shot. 30 dollars later and wondering if we are gonna be up tonight from food poisoning is not what I call good food. I am so disappointed and worried about the food being served I have a strange urge to have the health department check the place out just to make sure some of the ingredients are fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Although it is situated in a rundown and somewhat sketchy area, the food is soo damn good. Most people complain about pricing. It's authentic Thai food cooked fresh when ordered. If you don't like it, jack in the box is right across the way. I'm sure them tacos are way better. The price is fair, the portions are very generous, the staff is overwhelmed at times but will work at their very best to accommodate. With each check in on yelp, you get a free Thai tea, who can pass that up. Lunch specials are a great deal as well, egg roll with soup on the side of what you ordered to make sure you're full when you get back to work. This is a place worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Descent food bad service.  Ordered green curry with beef. They brought yellow curry with chicken. Then for the bill we had 3 different checks he put 2 on mine. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of good authentic thai food in my life...this was not even close to what I would call decent thai food.  It was edible.  I'll give it that...but that might just be because I was starving. The chicken pad thai was greasy and pretty flavorless until I slathered it in chili sauce.  Also, the thai tea was WEAK...no strong flavor and almost like they used regular milk or skim milk on top.  I'll even go as far as to say this is the worst thai food I've ever had.  

Service was just okay.  The place was deserted and nobody checked to see how our food was until we were pretty much finished.  

I won't be returning.  Sorry Karen."}
