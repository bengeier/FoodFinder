{"text":"Pizzeria Bosco is part of the new Richtree Natural Market food court in Eaton Centre (the more healthier food court on the other side of the mall). 

On a whim - I asked if they had gluten free crusts - they did. They do actually list it as well, which I didn't notice in the menu. 

I've tried the gluten-free margarita a few times now. 

They use to have a really thin crust gluten-free pizza (the white one not flax one) - which was the best GF thin crust pizza I have had in Toronto (yes, in a mall). It did not taste gluten-free! 

I believe they recently changed the GF crust - it's not as thin but still good (liked the thinner crust much better - really tasted more authentic). While the crust is thicker it still doesn't taste like typical gluten-free crusts. 

Surprised to find this option in Eaton Centre - my have gluten-free options changed. The Richtree Natural Food Court also has some more healthier options in general. 

My only cons would be there have been a couple of times where they didn't stock the GF crusts. One explanation was they had them in the back but needed to defrost or something (so they weren't keeping appropriate supply stocked up - I think). 

Also, not all employees were as aware of cross-contamination. Some were really good at using a clean pizza cutter and not getting the pizza on the counter with all the flour (I say this because this is something that can be prevented in their layout - not trying to say that you can't  prevent all cross-contamination). 
 
You can only get gluten-free by the pie - not single slices. 

Hopefully, they will bring back that super thin crust version.

Update: There is NO gluten-free crust option now - unless this has recently been changed. Too bad!"}
{"text":"I had pizza here a couple of times, it is part of the enhanced Richtree restaurant that I always loved (too bad they closed the one in college park, was just amazing, mmm the Milano sand which)
I had pizza margherita with extra buffalo mozzarella on it and mmm yummy!
Ideal for quick bite and the staff is nice and service is fast. Plenty of room to seat."}
