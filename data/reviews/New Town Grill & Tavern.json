{"text":"An up-and-down place. We're happy we found it, and have had good fried fish, ribs. Chili could be a whole meal. Burgers not so great; overdone and the beef tasted not quite beefy. Make sure to ask them to make the fries crispy; sometimes they come out limp. Outside seating can get very smokey."}
{"text":"OK I am back home for vacation. I have no car to get around. It's Friday afternoon. I am thinking it's lunch and beer time. Hey, I did yard work for the parents. How do I get chores at 40ish? 
I walk on down. Well many times over the two weeks I am home. I tried there wraps, chili bowl, french onion soup, fries, breakfast sandwich(Sat n Sun only breakfast), and wings. The only thing I didn't care for was the french onion soup. Everything was cooked well. It is more comfort food good. The prices. Cheap enough to make me miss the area a lot. $1.50 for draft beer 
The staff is very friendly. Kim, Kim(n Rick), and Nikki were all good company. They all were on top of patrons near empty glasses. Except those with the blue glasses. Hard to see. I had good conversations with people that happened to be there on lunch break, job hunting break, or just plain retired. The place is close to Lake Erie so it has that shack feel. The outside patio is large and only place to smoke. There is a nice little dinning area. The place is always busy and more so on weekends when breakfast is served. There is a nice special on Wednesday. Turf and Surf. 
In short, i enjoyed this place. It help make a good vacation. Wished I would have gotten Nikki, Kim and Kim's info to stay in touch. I look forward to coming back on my next visit back to home."}
