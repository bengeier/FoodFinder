{"text":"http://seafoodcentre.ca/ What a joke! When you walk in it looks nice until you see the right hand wall with some dirty fish tanks with a couple of fish you can't really make out in the dirty water. Then on top of this long stainless steel table there is a sink with ice in it and 3 whole fish exposed to the air, coughs, sneezes, saliva, etc.  But the biggest joke is the menu. EVERYTHING is ridiculously over priced. Fish and Chips are $14.99 and they advertise that the fish is TILAPIA! One of the cheapest fish in the market. The owners must be idiots who think that Tilapia as desireable or popular (well, it is popular but only because it it cheap), yet the charge what you can get Haddock or Cod for elsewhere.   The owner gave me a sample of the fish soup in a tiny plastic condiment cup. It was enough to tell it tasted like shit. Fish and water with no hint of any spices save for salt and pepper. Dirty fish water YUCK! I asked him to show me what the tartar sauce came in - it was a condiment cup slightly larger than the soup sample.  $2.99 for an ounce of mayo and relish. HA!  Best of all was his response when I suggested that $3.99 for 4 mussels was a bit high. I told him that I can often buy raw oysters for $1 each, an he is charging $1.25 for a measly mussel.  His reply, \"We have to heat it up with salt, oil and lemon.\" OH WELL THEN! You should charge $3.99 per mussel. Such a joke."}
{"text":"I have been to MTC several times and never noticed this place. They could use a better sign. Anyways, being the food ranger that I am, I naturally had to try out a new place. I was not terribly impressed.   I feel bad for this business. Fresh seafood in this area of the GTA simply isn't a sensible business concept. There aren't enough demand. You can tell it's not working because the fish tanks are empty. So their seafood must be of the frozen variety. Yet they price their menu items like they are fresh.  I had the shrimp pasta. It was alright. Nothing to go crazy about. It's something I can make myself easily. For the lunch special price of $13 it's alright. I wouldn't pay $15 for this considering the amount of shrimp. There are no veggies at all. It's literally just shrimp, pasta, and cream sauce. Is it that hard to garnish with some veggies?  If I want fish and chips, maybe I try again for their lunch special price of $9. Nothing else on their menu interests me except for seafood shawarma."}
