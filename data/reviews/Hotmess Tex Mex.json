{"text":"This place is awesome, great spot to have drinks with friends and the food is good and unique. A great addition to college st"}
{"text":"They have a beer and shot combo for $10 and it's not shitty choices. The decor looks cool and the staff is friendly. Will be coming back again soon to try their food. They sell hard shell tacos which not many places serve."}
{"text":"First visit, Saturday Oct 28th.  Had a great meal, and the Texas Sweet Tea with 3 shots of Jack.  The place is cozy and relaxed.  Nothing to complain about here. The d√©cor is delightful, and the washroom was really cute.  The stairs to the washroom were a little steep, but the railing helps. Great new find for me.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I really liked the character of Hotmess Tex Mex.  It had some old school signs, beer logos, pinups, an old car grill planted on the wall, a slot machine near the door, and tons of merchandise like old cans and cactus plants with their restaurant name on them.  It was a very cozy and unique restaurant and the Tex Mex (a fusion of American and Mexican food) vibe was clear from the way the restaurant was decorated.  The Frito Pie looked like a trendy food item that hit the food scene a few years ago (at the CNE) where you could eat the seasoned beef and toppings straight from a Doritos bag of chips!  For this though, the Frito Pie consisted of Frito Lay corn chips, chili con queso, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and \"Truck Stop\" or \"Three Bean Chili\".  This was delicious!  (I love a good tortilla dip!)  The Chili Con Queso (Tex Mex Fondue) \"Bob Armstrong\" was the best nacho dip I've had in recent memory!  It had chili con queso, taco beef, sour cream, and guacamole.  It was really cheesy -- so smooth -- and really delicious with the tortilla chips.  It was like comfort food to me!  The Guacamole on display looked like it was the \"Straight Up\" Guacamole with pico de gallo and lime.  This guacamole was also admirable.  It was very smooth and tasted just right!    The Pico de Gallo Dip had tomato, jalapeno, and lime and I liked how refreshing it was!  The Carrot Slaw was also eaten with tortilla chips.  This slaw had pineapple, pepitas, goat cheese, and chipotle dressing.  I tried a corner of the Pork Rinds which was seasoned with lime vinegar and loved it.  I could have finished an entire serving by myself.  They're addictive like potato chips!  The Coke and Bourbon Float was a dessert and consisted of three items: A shot of four roses bourbon, a bottle of classic Coke, and a mug full of buttermilk ice cream with salted dulce de leche and brown sugar pecans coating the rim of the mug.   There was also a stick of crispy bacon added to the mix.    The shot of bourbon was first poured into the mug and then followed by the coke.  There was immediately a \"float\" seen from the mixture of ingredients.  We tried this right away and it was an interesting mixture of bourbon, coke, and buttermilk ice cream.  If you want to enjoy this, you definitely have to share this with more than one person!   The crispy bacon was indeed crispy.  The Buttermilk Hotcakes had aged cheddar and green apple.  It was served with a helping of roasted jalapeno Aunt Jemima syrup. This might be the best hot cakes I've ever had!  The buttermilk hotcakes were so smooth, soft, fluffy, and PERFECTLY done!  You could taste the cheddar cheese in between the three layers of hotcakes too which I thought was so creative and different.  The green apples added a cut of acid to the carb-heavy item and the slight heat and spiciness (yet still sweet) of the roasted jalapeno Aunt Jemima syrup made the entire dish so tasty.    The Corn and Black Bean Enchiladas had chili tomato, avocado, and monterey jack. This was a vegetarian dish but it was so \"meaty\" that it would be quite satisfying for anyone."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Taco Tuesday and we're split on the ranking: she likes it, I don't. I didn't think the tacos were that good, and definitely not worth $6 each. I'll definitely stick to more authentic Mexican spots!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Food, drinks, service, all great. The food is a little heavy, but that's texmex. You gotta be a fan going in. The blended margarita was so good I gave myself brain freeze from drinking it too fast. Atmosphere is very kitschy. Lots of stuff to look at. Its a very unique spot on college and I hope it does well. Prices are moderate too. The tacos are $9 but they're huge and jam packed. Don't let the name turn you off, this is a gem."}
{"text":"I predict this place will go out of business. There was hardly any filling in the food we ordered so  we were basically eating deep fried shells with almost nothing inside. Great margins for the owner, but you will leave hungry and disappointed. There are so many great choices on the street. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"The three times I've been, the staff has been really nice.  The food is okay, a hit and miss tbh, and really depending on whether you're really craving junk food (i.e. kinda nostalgically good but also kinda bad for you). But the third time I went in, I got take out and had a chance to really take in the very concentrated decor and realised the eerily racist undertones everywhere. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but it honestly felt like the owner might be some lowkey undercover white supremacist or something. There was an old photo of the dukes of hazard with the \"iconic\" confederate flag car proudly displayed at the front. I understand the tex mex theme but it seems completely ignorant and insensitive (to say the least) to choose this poster as opposed to so many others much less symbolic of slavery.  There were also lots of posters about the right to own guns and all sorts of questionable stuff. Also I found it so incredibly creepy that in a restaurant whose entire cuisine has been completely appropriated from Mexican immigrants living in South that there is absolutely no homage paid to anything remotely Latino (with the exception to the sombreros (eye roll).  To say the least, the decor is overwhelmingly themed to celebrate a  vintage very white Southern American identity-- a time in history when things weren't actually so hot for anyone who wasn't white. Anyway, the decor and obvious appropriation and erasure of Latino culture made really made me feel uncomfortable, and frankly unwelcomed. I won't be going back and I really hope that the owners read this review and consider redecorating so that their patrons of colour feel more welcome."}
{"text":"What a great spot. Incredible guacamole and even better queso. The flavours are amazing and who would have thought to put apples in guacamole...these guys did.   The drinks are delicious and I recommend the Paloma.   The decor is amazing and the owner/chef hand picked all the items.   This is a must go and definitely the new \"it\" spot for taco any day!"}
{"text":"This place speaks to my sensibilities. It's a cozy little Tex Mex joint that has tasty food, strong drinks and Dukes of Hazard playing on an old, wood-framed 70's TV. If that sounds like your kind of place, you'll love it here.    The interior is plastered with all sorts of kitschy Tex Mex-inspired knick-knacks, the tunes are a mix of old country & rockabilly and they serve up slushie margaritas. Damon the bartender is super friendly and we always get great service. This is our go-to when we're we're catching a movie at The Royal across the street.  Food is really tasty and the menu is full of classics (Tacos, Chile Con Queso, Nachos , Chimichangas) as well as Tex Mex twists on Hot Dogs, Hamburgers and the like. Tacos are the old-school hard shell kind and are $5 on Taco Tuesdays. Really delicious. Great Guac and Queso too, which I'm particular about. They make comically large Pork Rinds in-house which come with a squirt bottle of Lime Vinegar. It's a really great combo.  As you can tell, I really love this place."}
{"text":"It's not that it wasn't good.  It's just that I felt like I was at a boring party and all they were serving me was cocktail weenies because that's the size portion - but it's not even like that because they weren't just giving me the weenies for free.  I had to pay for the weenies.    Remember, you need to substitute tacos for weenies."}
{"text":"Decent for what it is. It felt like an above average dive bar with an intriguing food menu. Had a beef taco and a brew. The taco had a lot of flavors going on. The rest of the menus looked interesting (food and drink). The servers were very nice. The ambiance is subjective. We sat at the back and watched muted episodes of Dukes Of Hazzard while checking out sombreros and lucha masks. Worked for me. Would return."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants in Little Italy. Went there with a friend recently for a quick bite to eat. Friend got the chicken enchiladas and I got the southwestern burger. Expecting your normal type of meal for the price (enchiladas was $14, burger was $12), we were disappointed with what came out. Though I was told the enchilada was spicy and filling, the burger was a huge disappointment. A small patty, equivalent to the size of a McDouble was provided to me, but came with no sides, and a severely undercooked patty. I'm all for having a medium rare beef patty on my burger, but this was just too rare for my liking and too expensive for what you get. On top of all this, their advertised \"tall boy special,\" where you get a $5 beer is completely false. We got a 355ml can of cheap beer for &5. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't go here unless you're willing to spend a ludicrous amount of money for small portions and mediocre food."}
