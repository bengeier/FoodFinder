{"text":"I`ve only been to the one in maple hts, if your food comes out fresh then its worth it
! quite delicious chix and waffles and the \"sweet Jesus glaze\" is the bomb.  If its not cooked to order just leave cuz it will NOT be good. worth the drive to the heights and order it fresh. dont go on weekend night w/out ccw permit."}
{"text":"I ordered the wings, they were okay. The sauce was really good though. It took forever to make like 5 wings. Service was okay, they seemed more interested in entertaining each other than delivering good service though. Ive gone to the location in Warrensville and it was much better."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just got to go get you a really filthy meal. You want to cuss at somebody about food. You feel like that, go to this place and eat breakfast and lunch at the same time. 

They put chicken on their waffles which is fine but what's with the bones? Crunch on them if they're small and gut down the cartilege and whatnot but you gonna choke yourself on one of those big bones. Spit it on the curb out front like me. I paid for it, right? It's mine to spit here or there. You're the same way, Charlie. That waffle is yours and that chicken is yours and you can do what you want with the bones.

I went in and asked what the hell about the waffle/chicken at the same time thing. They were all cutesy about it and thought it was southern or blah blah blah. I said, \"Is you is or is you ain't gonna give me one?\" They did.

And it was alright and you get iced tea or malt liquor at the gas station. 

It's Maple Heights, don't get shot. 

Order double, it's not enough. 

Drink first. 

Be nice and they give you a bigger piece. Or be hot. That works too, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles, need I say more ? It was great.

The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. The drinks (sodas) were a little more \"syrupy\" than I like, but for $1 and change it was great.

The menus were full, but I can't comment on because I only had the chicken and waffles. But that was great. The chicken was cooked well and the waffles weren't burnt or anything. Just right !

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast that won't break the bank. It was great !"}
{"text":"Friendly people. The food was great. Take out only. I wish the restaurant  was large enough to sit down."}
{"text":"I love Chicken and Waffles... it disappoints me that more places do not have this delicious and magnificent item on their menu.  I guess that is why I like places just like this.  

After living in Cleveland for a while, I finally discovered Mr Wonderful's.  Thankfully, it was not too far from me either.  The place is YUMMY.  Their sweet Jesus glaze is to die for.  They actually will substitute tenders if you ask too (I believe there was a small upcharge but it was well worth it).  

Even though the food is super duper great, and I have never been disappointed with food or service when I am there, I cannot give it 5 stars.  Why one may ask?  It is because I often would beat the staff there.... they never opened when they were supposed to."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating at this establishment.  The cook let me sample some foods and I absolutely fell in love with the garlic wings and the lemon pound cake.  I will definately patronize them again."}
{"text":"this restaurant is disgusting.  I went for the first time yesterday to redeem a coupon for a buy one meal get one free. First of all, the Maple Heights location did not honor my coupon although the back of it had their location listed. They said it was a \"misprint.\" Sure. So I had to travel to the Warrensville location. The manager did honor my coupon, but the food was deplorable. The wings tasted as if they were cooked the day before. They were hard and tough. The macaroni and cheese was the worst I ever had in my life. The noodles were mushy and I believe cheese whiz was used. There was no seasoning whatsoever and it was watery. I called to complain and the manager said he uses Velveeta and sharp cheddar but this was a lie. There was no real cheese in that dish. The greens were \"enh\" but they also lacked flavor. A woman who was waiting for her food told me the last time she came there, the greens made her ill. She said she thinks they were days old and had been reheated too many times. DO NOT GO HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The Willoughby location has already been shut down and this one needs to be next along with Maple Heights. Terrible food."}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled onto the existence of Mr. Wonderful's while searching for Chicken and Waffle places in Cleveland a couple of years ago.  Since none of the locations were in my area, it took a while to make a visit. 

Once I was finally able to make the trip, I headed out to the Euclid location, only to arrive as the electricity for the whole block went out. 

Not to be deterred, I continued on to the Maple Heights location, and am so glad that I did.  

The chicken AND waffles were both delicious.  The Sweet Jesus glaze really accentuated the savory crunchiness of the chicken, and the mac and cheese was, uh, wonderful, as well. 

I also couldn't resist the po' boy which was a tangy/spicy pile of sausage, sauce, fries, slaw, and heaven.

Mr. Wonderful's is just that.  It's an out of the way treat for me, but when I'm able it's a trip I'm willing to make."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my trip here! To start off I called in to place my order at 11:15 am and arrived around 11:40 am to get it because I was told it would take 25 minutes. When I arrived, I was told it was not ready. At 12 pm I asked again and the lady said they were still working on it. When they finally gave me my order, I thought I was set to go, as I am about to get in my car the other man that worked there screamed \"Lady, come back! You're order is wrong!\" I find it extremely rude and unprofessional that my order wasn't ready until 12:15 pm (ONE hour after I called it in) and that he had to scream across the parking lot like that. 

On top of that, when I went to pay, the lady would not take my restaurant.com gift certificate. It was not expired or anything but she did not honor it. As an establishment, I think it's deceiving for customers to buy the gift certificates and not be allowed to use it. 

Okay now about the food. I ordered the 1 waffle with 3 wings and 1 waffle with 4 tenders. The food was alright, nothing special. The waffle was burnt and chewy. I only liked the sauce that they put on the wings and tenders. 

Never going here again. I will wait until the next time I go to LA for Roscoes Chicken and Waffles!"}
