{"text":"Made reservations for 8 on 9/1/11 at 6:30PM. We arrived several minutes early & were promply seated, 15 minutes later a beverage order was placed along with a our meal order. One hour and twenty minutes later our salads were delivered, and at that time I told the waitress that if the main course was not served soon we would have to leave, since the 3 well behaved grandchildred were starving. She offered to deliver a free drink, which I declined. Her excuss was that they were unexpected busy due to a Groupon promotion. My reply was that we were the only table considerate to make reservations well in advance. The main course arrived 1/2 hour later. The waitress delivered the check along with a gift certificate  that I also declined. I left over a 20% tip  along with the gift certificate  to never return. I find it imposible to support and business that has little reguard for their clients. I have been a long time customer, and have never complained in the past. Their total lack of consideration turned a family celebration into a very disapointing event. I hope they learn to survive on discount coupons in the future."}
{"text":"This is not a place to go if you want ambiance.  However the food is amazing, specifically the veal.  Each one of us in our party ordered a different veal dish and each were exceptional.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So much potential ...     When I walked in the door (after 6pm - dinner crowd) - I see a sign to this unassuming restaurant.   It says:  \"Wanted Hostess, Busser, and Dishwasher\"  Unfortunately for the watiresses - they were busy (probably doing all the jobs above).   The restaurant was 2/3rds full based on my observation.    The menu was done in a font that appeared cursive which made it hard to read.   My food was cooler than i normally like it (like it was sitting too long waiting to be picked up).  The food I had - even though it was cooler than I nomally like had very good flavor.  The food:  I started with a Tomato Bisque soup.    It had really good flavor and was hot (temperature).  My main course.  I asked the waitress to give me what they are known for at the restaurant.   Her recommendation was the pork chop (see picture).    The pork chop was smoked, stuffed, and covered with gravy.     I had my option and chose the potato pancake which was served with a ladel of applesauce to cover it (very popular where I am from - I was missing my sour cream and applesauce - I know you are probably thinking gross but don't knock it until you try it and no I am not pregnant ;-))   Anyway everything was good and would have been better  if they had more help.  Atmosphere - This restauarant was packed for a Tuesday night.    You can tell they have a good following.  Price - The dinners range on the high side - $15-$35  with Steaks and Lobster being on the higher side).  My bill was $21.  Service - Excellent.    My waitress was probably serving half the restaurant (about 12 tables) - If you have ever worked in the service industry  - this is almost impossible but she and her partner did a great job.  I will be back and hope to increase my rating.  It is definitely worth a second try."}
