{"text":"Delicious food. They use fresh ingredients.  The owner and employees very friendly. It's worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Wow, even one week later I'm still stunned that someone actually recommended this restaurant to us by saying that it was all homemade and family owned and soooo good.  Portions are TINY.  My falafel platter came with several of the smallest, greasiest, half burnt falafel I've ever seen.  With it came some soupy hummus and the tiniest bit of tabbouleh.  The parsley in the salad wasn't even chopped fine as it should be and I couldn't find one speck of bulgar wheat in it.  This is all beside the fact that I asked for greek salad instead of tabbouleh (as I am allergic to wheat) and still got the tabbouleh.   I finally got the Greek salad that I ordered and it actually had regular black olives in it instead of greek olives-are you kidding me????  I had to press the grease out of the falafel with several napkins before I would even try to eat them.  You could tell that they had been cooked awhile before they were sold, as they were soft and lukewarm.  I am somewhat of a falafel fanatic, and the best falafel are cooked fresh to order, are crispy on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside.  The exact opposite of these.    Perhaps the worst part of the meal was the attitude of the woman who said she was the owner and the fact that they serve EVERYTHING, even if you are eating there, in styrofoam to go containers.  So uncool.  Although maybe if I ate the styrofoam it would have been better than the food."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out after a couple friends told me the food was great and the owner was a sweetheart. However, when I arrived I experienced quite the opposite.  First off, the owner was very impatient with me and my friend when we were looking at the menu, we probably spent a whole 3 minutes looking at it but she came back multiple times to ask if we were ready to order yet. We both got falafel platters.   The falafel platter was listed on the menu as coming with pickled veg, ours came with a bed of really wet romaine. Three tiny pieces of burnt (black) falafel. The owner was kind enough to offer some pita on the side for free, we ended up using it as napkins because there were no real napkins. Owner seemed to be selectively nice, she was very short and impatient with us but very kind to the next people. I don't know what we did wrong! Everything came in styrofoam even though we were eating in.   Bottom line, food was a pathetic joke. Especially for the price. Owner made us feel uncomfortable and rushed. As we were leaving she chased us down to ask how the food was. Overall a very strange and wasteful experience. I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"Great food. Decent prices. I just ate my remaining hummus with a spoon and then with my finger, in order to get every last bit. The gyro sandwich has a nice sauce to meat to pita ratio. Tasty falafel too.   The staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all about the food here.  Ordered the chicken kabob and it was almost inedible.  Very, very dry and not much taste.  Hummus was good and salad is salad.  NE Ohio has many wonderful mediterranean restaurants and I would suggest eating at them over this place."}
{"text":"You \"should\" eat at this spot if you like to listen to and be surrounded by a bunch of trashy, tacky, rude and disgusting employees.  This place will not last.  I've told everyone I know about what a horrible experience my mother and I had when just trying to order a falafel sandwich.  No other customers, 2 employees, and you would have thought we asked to have their first born.  They were openly yelling at each other, shoving food in their mouths, complaining about being \"so busy\" etc...  We were so uncomfortable by the way they interacted with each other, we told them to forget our order and we were out.  As we started to walk out, they began attempting to start a confrontation with my mother and I.  I laughed it off because I have some self-respect, etc...    Had they caught me in a bad mood, I may have slapped the taste out of their mouths.  If you're looking for Jerry Springer type ambiance for your meal, THIS IS YOUR SPOT!"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say I had a very pleasant experience with the owner when I visited today. She was nice and cordial. So,  I am going to write this review as gingerly as I possibly can.   The inside is very simple. I would have to assume this is a start up business, with the buffet chairs and plain tables. Which is fine. However, with the amount of rent they have to be paying there- I personally expected more aesthetically.   I got the Fatoosh salad with chicken added. It was good. I really thought the dressing was yummy. However,  nothing memorable, and Im extremely picky, and honestly this is where the snob in me comes to the surface. Fatoosh is a pretty standard Lebanese dish, and it just needed 'something'. I would have enjoyed it with more cucumbers, and some thinly sliced red onion--but thats just me. And it didnt have fried pita chips with it either, and thats a must. Also, I had to ask for extra sumac-- which she accommodated me nicely. I guess Im used to the salad being pre-tossed with dressing with the fixings....thats how the little place in the Valley does it. And its just how I prefer it.  The Hummus however-- i didnt enjoy very much.  I used to make my own Hummus when I had my little shop,. Some salt and pepper, along with more lemon and not as thin-- is what I recommend for starters. This had NO flavor what so ever. None. Ziltch. I dont want to be harsh, but when you do test tasting as you cook-- it makes a world of difference.   I didnt want to get too technical or come across insulting......, but I had my own little cafe at one time- and I cooked from scratch. This place has the opportunity to become great, if they take all their reviews into consideration. Dont take things in an insulting manner, but use it to learn and adapt...to change and become better.   Seems like everybody is a foodie these days, and we do know what tastes good and what doesnt. LOL  Their food line is very clean and organized and with a little 'tweaking'...im sure this little gem will flourish. :))"}
{"text":"This is definitely a new place that is still trying to find its legs and trying to train employees on the spot.  With them training people on the spot, it can take a while to get your food out in a timely manner.  Though they offer tables and chairs to dine-in, this place is meant for take-out.  The falafel is really good, but save your money by not getting the chicken kabob (only comes with lettuce, onions, pieces of chicken, and tomatoes...no sauce) or falafel platter (not bad, but not that great...comes with 4-5 falafel, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled beets, onions, hummus, greek salad, and tatziki dressing).  The hummus is okay...neither great nor horrible, but could definitely be better.  For what you get, the price is a little higher than I think it should be, but not by much (maybe $1 or so overpriced).  I'll definitely go back to this place to give it another shot, and now I can go there with much lower expectations and know to try something different...probably their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel on pita. It was too well done and runny green inside. Sorry but I cannot recommend their felafel.   I took two bites and threw it out."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you like Mediterranean food. Carryout style restaraunt with a fun positive staff everyone should at least try this place: I call it the Mediterranean chipotle"}
{"text":"They want 9.60 for a \"falafel platter\" it only comes with falafel, sauces, and a tiny salad. Heck no, walked out! I go to a place downtown where a \"falafel platter\" is falafel, pita, hummus, tabbouleh, veggies, salad and pickles for 6 bucks."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  Owner operator so everything is done with care.  Extremely clean!  Everything is very fresh and made to order when need be.  I'll be back, often!"}
{"text":"They have the best tabouli in all of NE Ohio! It's made to order so it doesn't sit in the mire of marinate and congeal."}
{"text":"To start off, the food was fine. I just wish there was more of it. The portion size compared to other Mediterranean restaurants in the area were unreasonably small for a higher price. The service was good, and the dining area was clean. Chances are I wont go back unless portions get bigger."}
{"text":"Definitely happy with my decision to eat at falafel  fresh friendly and fast definitely an A+ lunch decision chicken kabob with the best cucumber sauce I've ever had mmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Love everything about it. Basic , good, flavorful food. A mom and pop business. Way superior to the crap chain restaurants."}
