{"text":"When the manager's away, the staff will do absolutely nothing but try to get laid and ignore paying customers. Really sad because we've been here a lot over the last few years, and always had a good experience.   Last night, it was like everyone got stoned and forgot they were actually working. It wasn't even busy, and we repeatedly had to track down our server to ask for drinks, food, and the check.   It was so bad, all of the tables around us cashed out, and started going to the bar for drinks... When we followed suit, we had to actually go track down the bartender (who was busy chatting with a young blonde at the of the bar) and tell him we wanted to order drinks. He took our order, but then wandered off to go talk to the blonde again! Really???!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks small from the outside but don't let that fool you. It's so cool inside. First time here with a friend and it will be a favorite forever. Our server was Michelle, she was so kind & not the 'overly friendly' type that annoy me.    The food is great & if you want to watch the game there are tv's everywhere!"}
{"text":"awe, the food was OK for bar food, it was a little too loud for me last night though! Service was ok to good."}
{"text":"Irish breakfast (aka a fry) used real Irish sausages, bacon and black and white pudding! Soda/brown bread was lovely and served with plenty of butter. Worth a try. Sausages could have been a little more evenly browned. Potatoes were under cooked but seasoned really well. Unfortunately they overpowered the flavor of the fry. Personally I prefer home fries that are more like cubed French fries (aka chips) without the onions (although they were very tasty). The baked beans weren't cooked enough either but overall it was a pretty good taste of home in a pinch. Staff and service was awesome. Place has a real country Irish Bar feel."}
{"text":"Hands down the greatest bartenders in town. Dave, Eric, and Chris are salt of the earth. The owners, Pat and John are great fellas as well and always greet me warmly. The place has always felt like my second home and family. Hell, I met my wife there and many fine friends besides.  I always have a great evening any time I can make it out. Food and entertainment always satisfy. The crowd there is generally cool and low key, and I always find good conversation with random folks on nights I roll solo."}
{"text":"Figured I would give the place a try since I work just across the street. Worst service in my life!!!! Have sat for 20 minutes with out anyone coming around to take an order or even acknowledged. It wasn't busy at all!!!! Finally after waiting so long I got up and left. Won't be back if this is how the service is."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time, new to the neighborhood. I was excited to try an authentic Irish Pub at last but unfortunately when I walked in my hopes were dashed. Interior was kind of drabby and there was no host/hostess at the door. I came in and wandered about a bit and eventually sat myself down at a table. Wait staff seemed to be unaware I was there so I eventually got up and went to the bar myself to get a drink. Didn't bother with the food and just paid and left."}
{"text":"Went Sunday for afternoon games for football. Packers bar (shocking! what bar in AZ isn't?) Place was pretty busy. Had two seats at the bar for us to sit. Bartender was nice and efficient, drinks were good.   As for the food, small portions, not all that tasty. Ordered a caesar salad to share, wasn't large enough. For $9 (mind you, no meat, just lettuce, cheese, dressing and croutons) we thought we'd get a pretty good size salad. Had a baked potato and mashed potatoes/gravy for our \"sides\". Gravy wasn't cooked right, portion again, small. Took 45 mins to get the three items. Bartender claimed they only had two fryers, so the kitchen was behind. However, we didn't have fried food items.   Overall, we will go back. Gal next to us ordered a reuben that looked life changing. So... until next time."}
{"text":"We just moved to town and were looking for a place exactly like this.  This bar is not posh, it is not shiny or pretty, it doesn't have a huge menu... and that is all fine by me.    What it does have is a friendly wait staff, plenty of seating, good/ok live music, and a great bar selection.    The mix of people that was there the night we stopped in was entertaining... I can't really comment on that, as I still think everyone here in Phoenix is crazy... lol.    Either way, it seems to have that good old suburban bar feel to it, which is nice and cozy when you don't feel like dolling yourself up and having a fancy night out."}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Service is above average.  Solid small draft beer selection. Good atmosphere.  Had music setting up."}
{"text":"The most unfriendly, bigoted, assh*les patrons I have ever been around in years. The servers were fine, but if you want to feel like you're in the south back in the 1800s, this is your place. F*ck this place. Hope it burns to the ground."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Went in for drinks one Friday night, found 2 spots open at the bar, had great service, proper Guinness, and then enjoyed some fried pickles. The live music was great and the vibe was fun and vibrant    Went in two weeks later with intent of eating dinner, found two seats at the bar, were ignored for nearly 7 minutes (the 7 minutes before happy hour ended) while the server seemed to pretend to count her drawer, then  had to ask if we could get an order in before happy hour ended. With a sigh, she said yes, we ordered two pints of Guinness, one Jameson and the fried pickles. 10 minutes later, we had nothing in front of us. I appreciate when a bar takes the proper time with guinness, but this was ridiculous.   Usually the last few minutes before happy hour ends, the bartenders do a great job of making the rounds to make sure everyone is taken care of. Not the case at The Dubliner this night. No staff to be found anywhere. Although I could see our two pints of Guinness sitting there on the other side of the bar. Finished. Ready.  Wanting to be delivered. And when I asked the only staff in sight, she said oh yeah they're going to grab them now, I saw someone grab them, move them about two inches to the right and set them back down. Then everyone vanished again for about 4-5 more minutes.   It wasn't just is, it was everyone at the bar who was sharing the feeling of being ignored.   Finally, someone grabbed the pints and delivered then with the Jameson and dropped the fried pickles off soon after. Just in time, too, as we were just about to walk.   Wish we had. The pickles were NOTHING like our previous visit, they were barely cooked and swimming in a pool of oil. Inedible. We mentioned it to the bartender, who didn't offer any apologies, all she said was that you never know what you're gonna get, it depends on who is working the fryer that night. Wow.   With that, we gulped our drinks, paid the tab, and left. They clearly didn't want our business that night.   Usually when I have a 50/50 experience somewhere, I'll go back for a tie breaker, but it may be a while before we make it back around to The Dubliner for the deciding vote."}
{"text":"Great live music! I used to go here a lot more but it still one my favorite bars. Saint Patty's day here is crazy!. Pretty good food and always decent drinks. Recommend it for getting a group of friends together and chillin"}
{"text":"I think I just had the worst waitress I've ever had. I guess it's a milestone. She took a while to get to our table, no big deal. Told us they were out of the beer my boyfriend ordered, then remembered maybe they weren't. Brought me a dish that wasn't what I ordered. After my bf finished his meal I was brought salmon so overcooked it was hard, 'lemon caper sauce' that tasted like flour mixed in water, and boxed mashed potatoes. The mixed veggies were OK. My boyfriend ordered a refill on his all-you-can eat fish fry and another beer. She forgot it all and came back a while later to ask if he wanted more (!?). I tasted the fish fry. Flavorless cod, just like they rolled it in plain flour, with pre-packaged French fries. I'll never understand why a restaurant can't cut and fry a potato. The fish refill came without the sauce for which he'd asked. The waitress did offer a free Guinness, but I had to pay full price for the salmon dinner I didn't eat and complained about.  At least I was entertained by the band butchering some cover tunes. Doesn't make me want to rush to the Green Isle anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for a couple drinks, probably one of my favorite bars i've ever been to. Great irish pub atmosphere and music"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here a couple months ago with a bartender. We told the owner about her, and I haven't seen her around there since. Went back last night to see authority zero play and I had a great time! The bar was literally PACKED. Wall to wall. Found a small spot at the bar and was served my drinks super quick! Glad to see that things are getting better here."}
{"text":"My wife had the chicken boxty and I had the Shepard's pie. Both were wonderful and we would come back again for sure.  Service was good but I could see it slowing as they got busier. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was a regular customer at The Dubliner. When I tragically lost a close friend I went to Dubliner while I was grieving and Chris the bartender was very respectful and sincere with me. One of the owners, John, has been social with me and we've had some insightful political conversations. But on the night of October 23rd 2015 one of the managers, Tara, treated me very poorly. So poorly that I will never step foot in that establishment again. Professionalism is a foreign idea to her. Taras child like behavior was uncanny and on display when she confronted me in front off the bar. Pretty sad really."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the Phoenix area, and wanted to find a good Irish Pub.  We luckily found the Dubliner.  Chris the bartender was great, along with all of the other bartenders (sorry didn't get their names).  The drinks are great, food is great, and the atmosphere is also great (not too many greats?).  Highly recommended for food, drink, music, atmosphere.  One of the best fish and chips that I have ever had, anywhere.  My wife loves the BLT's as well."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The staff are awesome, they have live music six nights a week, and the clientele are 99% douche free.  Never tried the food, but who the hell goes to a bar to eat, anyway?"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Waited 45 minutes from sandwich this place had 7 people in it unbelievable.  The sheriff spent more time complaining about not having enough help instead of servicing customers."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but sadly will not be returning again.  On a lighter note, I actually thought the restaurant itself was pretty cool and I also even liked the food. Both the Shepherd's Pie and the Corned Beef were quite good!  So why won't I come back here? One of the staff was extremely rude to one of my friends and made her feel completely unwelcome. It was especially bad, because he was a manager. She brought a problem to him and he basically told her he didn't care and didn't need her business. I didn't catch all of what went on myself, because it was a loud place with music playing, but a big thing for me is the way that the management treats their customers. We ended up leaving earlier than we had planned, because my friend got offended by the manager, so this is not a place I will be returning to.  I would not recommend this place to anybody if feeling valued as a customer is important to you."}
{"text":"If you would like to have your rights violated by uneducated security guard and evening plans ruined head to the Dubliner.  Guess what Complain Submitted to DPS. Horrible Place avoid at all cost !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good bar vibe...Arizona civil war college football games were playing the night I was here so the crowd was great, and the elderly gentleman playing old Irish tunes on the stage up front added to the lively environment. Was in a strip mall setting and I was visiting from out of town so I would have not noticed it had my friend not taken me here. Still though, love my Irish pubs, whiskey,  and Guinness."}
{"text":"Always awesome service always different people to chat with, always great food. Many of the staff have been here. Long time and they remember you, feels good to hang here."}
{"text":"The Wednesday night entertainment is AMAZING. Excellent musician and performer. Makes you laugh while enjoying great music. It can be hard to flag down the waitress, wish they had menus sitting at the table so you could flip through while you waited so you didn't have to wait to flag down the waitress to GET the menu and then wait to flag down the waitress to order. The fries are quite tasty but eat them up while they are warm. Prices are good.  There are darts and a foosball table which are fun to do!"}
{"text":"This place is OK. I have never eaten there but have been to drink many times.  It's a pretty big place.  There's a good mix of people and age groups and seems like a lot of people take dates here.  The security staff here are kinda douche bags.   The worst part about this bar though is the fights. There is always fighting here. A fight here and there can be entertaining but its old and annoying when there is a fight every single time I go."}
{"text":"Place is cool to come and relax and forget about the outside.. No rush just a nice chill atmosphere, kinda slow but the crowd and price are good. If you are in a rush I would suggest Taco Bell. Almost all nights here there is a large crowd and some decent dart players."}
{"text":"We visited again. Open mic night is actually Sunday, not Monday. This time we ordered food. I had a philly; it was unremarkable, but it was edible. The beer was still good.   Unfortunately, the patronage left much to be desired. We initially sat at the bar. The big guy two seats over was loudly discussing his personal information with lots of graphic details and use of the eff bomb every three or four words. After about five minutes or so of this, we decided to move to another part of the bar. I know it's a bar and after a night of drinking, conversation flows, and it's not always nice.   As we passed a large drunk man sitting alone at the end of the bar, he confronted my bf about \"walking by without speaking.\". Look. We are from Kansas and this is the second time we have been here ever. Why would we speak to this man?  My bf smiled and indicated we were just there to eat. The man then confronted ME and demanded to know if I was a girlfriend or a wife. When we moved a second time to escape, this goon followed us and put his hands on my bf. I thought it was all over. My bf minds his own business, but he does not take kindly to confrontational people. The bouncer was about six feet away, but apparently this dude is a regular, so he was allowed to harass us. Bouncer did eventually call a cab, but until it arrived, this man was allowed to teeter around the bar touching people and getting into their business.   I have no desire to return to The Dubliner after this experience. It could be a cool place, but a couple of seedy characters and the staff's inattention to their incredibly offensive behavior have spoiled it for me."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday and had great service. Tonight I walked in and was ignored by the stupid blond working the bar. After 10 minutes sitting with no drink, I left.  I'll never be back again."}
{"text":"Dropped in recently to grab a pint and try their bar food. I have to say that their wings were great. The bartender made me feel like I was a regular patron. The place was packed but the regulars made room at the bar for me to sit and engaged me in conversation. I felt really welcomed. It's a great pub."}
{"text":"Ok!  Lived in the area for 15+ years AND keep giving this place a chance, against my better judgement!  I really would like to make this my regular hang out since I'm a couple blocks away.  NOT going to happen.  Service is slow.  Bar staff is not very friendly.  More like a bother,  than a paying customer funding your bills."}
{"text":"Tired is the best word to describe this place.  We've lived by it for a long time and thought we'd give it a try.  What a mistake!  No one greets you, no sign to tell you to sit wherever, and no waitress showing up to acknowledge you are there.  When she finally did, it was quite obvious she didn't want to be there.  Shepard's pie - made with hamburger instead of lamb.  I thought I'd try it anyway.  When I saw the presentation - I should have sent it back.  A big glob of a dish with everything spilling everywhere.  And a ton of cheese melted on top - not a normal ingredient in SP.  Plain, boring, no spice whatsoever.  Hubby's hamburger was a frozen patty - no creativity at all - yet it's called the \"Dubliner\".    If you want a dive bar, go for it.  If you want real food, turn around and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is that they actually have Kilkenny on tap, one of my favorite beers.   That's about it. The place is very dark, and most of the people that come here are trash. Washed out biker types and the local punks.   They have darts which is a nice touch.  They loose points for having armed security walking about. It makes me really uncomfortable for these guys to be open carrying in a bar. There is absolutely no reason to have armed bouncers. If the place is that dangerous, they should have a uniformed officer stationed outside."}
{"text":"Great wings.. Excellent personable bartenders.. Also I asked for \" some extra celery and carrots \" with my wings and assumed id get 2-3... They gave me a whole plate of it with extra ranch and BLEU CHEESE! .. The traditional Irish fare like the sheppards pie is absolutely terrific and the Irish soda bread was really delicious.. I been back 2 times and the food is great .. Every time"}
{"text":"Amazing bartenders and waitresses.  Great food.  Plenty of football.  Awesome prices,  Chill atmosphere.  Best cheese fries in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We ordered beers and food. Food never came out after about an hour after she said it will be out soon. She waited about 30 min to even show her face around our table for another beer. She was very busy flirting with a group of about 8 guys grabbing and touching them. When we mentioned our food she said \"I'm so sorry, remind me what you ordered. Next time you have to let us know\" Why do I have to remind you?? It was not even busy. Stop flirting with every guy you see and do your job!"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and was a favorite when I lived in Phoenix in the 90s.  Reasonably priced drinks and good food and still that way today in 2014.  They have expanded the other side of the bar which is nice.   I have to give a shout out to Vanessa who works the day shifts.  She is super friendly, great service and seems to know all the regulars by name. She made me feel right at home on Saturday.  I even went back again today.   The pulled pork sandwich was delicious.  I wanted something sweet today and she brought out this chocolate chip cookie that was still hot with vanilla ice cream melting over it.  It was wonderful.  If I can swing it I may come by a third time before I leave this is how fond I am of the place. They have live music some evenings I think.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it isnt in St Louis LOL  Seriously, stop by.  It is in a strip mall at Thunderbird and 40th on the SW corner two doors down from the dentist."}
{"text":"Played trivia at the Dubliner last night.  Trivia was definitely the highlight.  Service was slow, semi-friendly, sporadic, and frustrating.  This may have been because it seemed there were only 2 servers. The beer was cold and chap- great combo when it comes to beer.  The boneless wings were decent, the carrots and celery were sub par (pretty hard to mess up those veggies), but the blue cheese was great- lots of blue cheese chunks.  The Shepards pie was hot and looked good, but was just average- adding Tabasco helped."}
{"text":"I love Irish bars, and I was happy to have found this one while my wife was shopping. The ambiance is authentic, the beer is cold and tasty (don't order American light beer, you would look like an idiot), the Guinness is on draft and perfectly pored and the waitress attentive. Sit at the bar and meet new people."}
{"text":"Great food great authentic Irish fare and best of all close to home"}
{"text":"Live a block from this place. Good food and friendly staff. Come here at least once a week. Live bands on the weekend."}
{"text":"No bar anywhere in this area comes as close to pulling everything off like the \"Dub\".  Beer Selection, Darts, TVS, lots of seating, events, great prices and a great mix of people.  The staff is always great, and ready to serve at all times.  Come here open minded, stay for a bit, watch the crowd pour in.  Always a good time."}
{"text":"Jess rocks as a server and The Sullivan's kick butt! What a great band! Love their Irish music. But they can play anything!"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times and I get the same thing every time.  The Shepards Pie is outstanding.  I always want to try something different, but I know that I will be disappointed that I didn't have my regular. The waitresses here have always been friendly and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Aw, I can't vote zero stars?  The service is the worst I've ever had EVER. I asked for menus ... apparently not.  Had to go physically get a menu from behind the bar.  Asked to order and the waitress said she'd be right back.  Spent the next half hour trying to get her attention - no such luck. When I finally got to order my food, it was another half hour before I got to eat it.  I'm sorry, but when I go somewhere to eat, I'm HUNGRY and I'm not happy when I'm hungry.  Waiting over an hour to eat is just bad."}
{"text":"I had to remind my server we ordered food. Never came out. Enough said. When the check came out I asked if our food was forgotten about. I was told..... \"Next time just give me a poke\" really?"}
{"text":"I used to work here and the staff and locals are like family. If u are down to earth ~ I'm sure you'll love the dub! No pretentiousness here! There's good entertainment almost every night of the week. The band that plays Tuesday nights is the BEST! Weekend nights are pretty busy and crowed, but the drinks are priced right and the food is really good too! My faves are the ckn boxty, the Reuben & the Philly ~ but basically everything the menu is DELISH! If u wanna have some real Irish fun, visit the Dub!! It's the place to be on St. Patricks Day for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is near my house. Haven't visited it until recently but it's a nice quiet place. Golden tee is probably the second best thing they have, the first being Guinness on draft. Would definitely recommend this place if you're interested in a quiet place with good service."}
{"text":"Yikes! This one hurts me, because based on my experience onsite with the girl attendants, and the manager- it seemed, and my take out order, ambiance, and all that I was 100% sure it would be a top review. But I would like to just be sincere and say, the food was not there at all. No, not at all. And that was dissappointing. It was tasteless.... One of my pet peeves.  Their fish and chips are made of quality fish. It did feel fresh. But totally tasteless. The coleslaw has no forgiveness though. It was just lettuce with mayo. I still give it a high 3 stars because this is one of those staples in the neighbourhood worth of giving it a try. Even if once, for their ambiance, and great selection of drinks. No better place to have a Guinesss I bet."}
{"text":"Three of us came here on a Friday night at about 7:30. The waitress was too busy socializing with her friends at a nearby table to actually do much for us. She couldn't remember how much a pitcher of beer was. We found out at the end of the night that they are $17! A little pricey considering this is a dive bar with broke-looking customers such as ourselves! :-P The food was ok, once we got it. My booth seat was broken and it would fall inside of itself if I leaned on it wrong. That could be embarrassing if I wasn't careful! The main thing is the service was horrible. We left early and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Irish beef stew, shepherd pie, sausage rolls, and the bread pudding were all excellent and worth the price. Everyone in the group was very happy with their selection. It was lunchtime on NYE - there were plenty of people there to put up decorations for this evening, but they only had one person there working as a server (not sure how many were working the kitchen). It took quite a while for us to get our food, and even then, only two of the four of us got food at first, and then it took a while for the other two to receive their food. A drink that was ordered early on in the meal wasn't brought out until after the check had been paid. I believe our server was doing the best she could with the other tables she had but it is unfortunate that they weren't properly staffed to make it a 5 star experience for our first time dining at The Dubliner."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night; the place was pretty busy. We ordered food around 9pm so the kitchen stays open late so that is a plus. We got a burger and sweet potato fries - both very good. Try the sweet pototo fries with the plum sauce - yummy! Drinks were reasonably priced and the wait staff was friendly and prompt. No complaints from me.  They had a bad playing too that was good, but it was rock. I sort of expected an irish type band to be playing especially on a weekend night. The band was still good though, don't get me wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place for what it is: a neighborhood Irish dive. You cannot rate this place on any other scale. Yes, the furniture is old and faded. The food is not made by a top chef. One does not visit the Dubliner for an amazing sit-down meal and 5-star service; you come for light beer and shots, the live music, and the neighborhood crowd."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Loved the trivia night. My problem is the food and furnishing.  First - ordered the \"Shepherds Pie\" .... grainy thin mashed potatoes over hamburger/veggies that was over cooked and under spiced.  Little to no flavor.  Covered by a boiling hot thick layer of shredded cheese.  No Bueno.  My dining companion had the guiness chicken.  He questioned if the chicken was cooked through.  It was rubbery.  Flavor on the sauce was ok, but the veggies tased old - as if they'd been in the fridge for a few days.  Sorry - not a fan.  The table where we sat was showing it's age - the finish was wearing off and everytime I bumped up against the edge - my shirt pulled a few slivers off and imbedded them in the material.  I spent a few moments on the ride home pulling them out.  A good powerwash and some dusting might help as well as some maintenance work on the furnishings."}
{"text":"Had the chicken fries which were awesome!  Good beer selection, TV, pool, darts....live music....uh what else do you want in an irish bar?  I frequent this place when looking for live music during the week.  Cold pints are a plus and the clientele seems very friendly."}
{"text":"I've lived across the street for almost 4 years now and finally went in for some beer and food.   The beers were great, nice and cold. Their food was pretty good too for a bar.  The main issue with this place is the waitresses.  They all seem to be in a bad mood all the time.  Unless you're a regular, you will be treated like a bother.  I've been there 3 times, different waitress each time, and all very blah.  The bar itself is much bigger than it looks on the outside, and has a lot of tvs for sports."}
{"text":"The Dubliner is not an authentic Irish Pub but it is one of my favorite bars to go to because the crowd is down to earth and drinks are CHEAP. Where else can you get a red bull vodka for $4? The crowd is a diverse mix of hipsters, hippies, skaters, and a few old weirdos here and there. If you went to high school in the area your bound to run into someone you haven't seen in years. I always have a great time when I go to the Dubliner because I meet such interesting people. You can find me here when I don't feel like dressing up for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"love the dubliner, nice local hangout. Last night we went to listen to open mic. The people who organize it are inconsiderate and rude. They were over 30 minutes late in starting. A friend of theirs, Dominick,  singing with an accompanist on the bass. Once they were done they sat at the bar with the organizers. Dominick even borrowed a man's guitar. Done of them  had to manners to sit in the area and  watch the players after them.  Extremely rude in my book. I will not go back to listen to the Open Mic at the  Dubliner."}
{"text":"What Brad T. said.   done.   What? I have to write more?  OK, here's a little more:  -real people, not just a pretty crowd -music can get really loud, but that's not necessarily a bad thing -great prices on pitchers of beer -kick back relaxed environment -fun for people watching"}
{"text":"Normally we love the Dubliner, but I have to tell you Saturday night, it was awful.  My husband got a bacon cheeseburger and was very disappointed. The burger was totally bland. No seasoning what so ever.  I had the corned beef and cabbage and same thing. Very unseasoned. The potatoes were so awful and the cabbage was just boiled. Not with the corned beef and again, no seasoning.  The our server was terrible. We waited forever for our drinks and had to flag down another server to get another beer.  All in all, just not the same as we had come to expect."}
{"text":"Tonight I sat in to listen to take cover! I wish this comfortable neighborhood bar would focus on good food and affordable drinks because the live \"entertainment\" has been a let down."}
{"text":"The Dubliner will be a long time staple. It's a great go-to bar for happy hour, post-dinner, or whatever floats your boat. There are darts, that Hunter arcade game, as well as karaoke, and live bands.   The staff is always super friendly and they make you feel welcome. The drinks are not overly priced. It's a good place to sit for hours drinking pitchers of beer and relaxing.  The food is standard bar fare with some Irish menu items as well. For dessert, they have bread pudding which I haven't had the chance to try yet but the large baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream was decent.   Don't expect anything fancy. The charm is kind of divey and unpretentious."}
{"text":"Good traditional Irish bar food. Service staff flows well in chaotic situations. Roomy and has multiple bars.  Live entertainment and traditional Irish fare. If you are a good old Irish boy like me, hit this place Early before the wanna be Irish people start to flow in. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Two words....ULSTER FRY!!!!  Perfect for that \"Hangover\" or the morning after.. where you are moving alittle slow... add a Bloody Mary to take off the edge and you are ready to go!!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC, moist, tender corned beef year round! Honestly, this is a great bar with live music and a cheap enough bar tab, but the quality of the food exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"Nothing to this place, the food was alright, the serves was just ok and the band playing there was horrid, I don't see myself ever going back here ever!"}
{"text":"This is a very good neighborhood bar.  Definite Irish feel to it.  The food is decent, and the drinks are great.  It can get pretty crowded on the weekends.  They have a pretty great party on St. Patrick's day, take up the entire parking lot of the shopping mall they are in... pretty good time..."}
{"text":"This place actually has pretty good bar food. I haven't had anything yet that wasn't good. The only problem is all the reviews that say the service stinks are absolutely true.  If the servers aren't outside smoking they are texting on their phones or standing around chatting among themselves and ignoring the customers. My advise would be to go there but go in with the opinion you need to be a jerk to the server and demand the service you are paying for. Skip the tip and keep doing it until they get it."}
{"text":"It's a pub so it's a good place for a cheap pint and a shot and maybe to throw some darts but that's about it. People make a bar great but the regulars here don't."}
{"text":"Bobby is a very rude server. She has no personality considering she works at the bar. Food is very dry and takes a while."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have visited the Dubliner. The only reason I haven't frequented the place lately is because I don't live near them anymore so I can't just either walk home or call a cab for 5 min ride. However there drinks are strong and cheap! Either that or the bartender was being very friendly on the few times I have visited :) The food is not to shabby either. I mean you can't possibly mess up fish and chips. Hmm fish and chips. So go, check it out, but remember if you have too many, call a cab. Did I mention that their drinks are strong and cheap! #winwin!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for tasty great food, this is the place!  If you are looking for FANCY it is not for you. Signs of wear in the seating area, but nothing but tasty on the menu. Corned beef sliders yummy, and the wings may be the best in town. Everything is priced just right. The servers  (we had Amanda) are attentive, and personable and the drinks are great. So if you are looking for down to earth great   Home cooking with an Irish flair, you just found it."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I go here weekly and the service and food are amazing. Great dive and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and listen to some music. The prices are great and the staff is friendly. Low key and and relaxed environment."}
{"text":"This place can get really awesome or really dull dependent on one solitary man resembling a leprechaun with a filthy mouth and penchant for calling out mouthy toolbags, all while playing the guitar and happily caroling away in Irish drinking hymnals.  It can get really crowded, which makes standing really tedious and plants a target on your big forehead for the leprechaun to abuse.  On St. Paddy's Day, this place is chaos, and like most other forced holidays is not worth getting into the carnival atmosphere just to say you did it.  Cash-only holidays get old in a hurry."}
{"text":"Was here tonight.  It is OK!  Not much Irish things on the menu, more of a bar food type joint.  Potatoe skins were meh.  The paddy o melt was meh too.  The live music was a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a local bar that has a great atmosphere and people more our age.  We stopped in for a drink last night on our way home, and was nicely surprised by the friendly staff, cleanliness of the bar, and bathroom.  Lots of bar space, tables, and darts...our favorite.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fogo the bartender here was very conversational and provided excellent service. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the crowd, live music, and friendly service from our server (Heather)when we checked out this place back in March. My bff and I were in town for a Ragnar Relay and staying with a local friend, who brought us here the night we got in. Unfortunately, it was too late to get any food (but Del Taco isn't far!) But we still enjoyed chatting at a table and listening to live music. Prices were good and service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went here while my sister was in town to play trivia on Monday night. Had a good time and was able to bring my 13 year old along. Corned beef sliders were amazing. The rest of the Irish food was subpar. Chicken boxty had very little flavor."}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm going to say authentic & Irish in the same sentence as \"located in a Phx plaza\" but I will. One of the best, most Irish restaurants I've ever dined at. Great entertainment as well."}
{"text":"No utensils or ketchup were provided after I ordered and received my food. Asked for ketchup afterwards and was provided but just wasn't impressed with this bar at all."}
{"text":"This is the Irish bar in its purest form.   Plenty of dart boards line the walls and pitchers float around by the dozen. There are a few long drinking hall style tables which are always entertaining for big groups. The service staff is no-nonsense, but good. The crowd is my favorite aspect at the Dubliner. None of the typical Scottsdale attitudes and cheeziness will be found here . . . and if it is, it won't stay long.   Good live music takes it up a notch and puts it into the top five of my favorite bars in town."}
{"text":"always a good crowd and mix of ppl usually. they have some really talented local musicians and then on the other side they have darts. i just wish they had more dart tables b/c half the time they are taken. the food is average with disgusting fried mushrooms as one of the options-yuck and olives in a quesidalla-also yuck. some of the bartenders are better than others. its very laid back compared to a scottsdale bar as far as dress which is why i like it but its not too hole-in-the wall were its boring or dirty."}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner to see The Sea Merchants perform. Had never been here before and were amazed at how packed the place was! Service was cheerful and probably could have used a little more help - not sure they were expecting the crowd they got last night, but we were enjoying the music and not too concerned with how fast service was. Had the Guinness Chicken, sweet potato fries, the Irish soda bread and washed it all down with a couple of brews. All pretty good. I'd recommend the place for a good time with friends. Relaxed, casual and fun! And the Sea Merchants performance was a rockin' good time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale. They have great food, drink specials, live music, and fun games (SONGO). One of the best Irish Pub's I've been to."}
{"text":"Dive bar, live music, friendly servers, lots of regulars. They have Irish bar food that's decent, but don't go in expecting a great meal."}
{"text":"A dude playing irish music on a fiddle in a bar in North Phoenix?  Count me in.  This is a pretty good pub-y place with your traditional attempt at irishness (stew, shepherd's pie, bangers & mash) with a few irish beers (guinness, of course, harp & smithwick's) while also having your traditional bar food.  Nothing fancy, everything is pretty straightforward.  Probably really a 3 star place, but the live entertainment adds a bonus star."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I had the wrap and it was great.  Beer selection was below average and they were out of two different selections listed on their menu."}
{"text":"Great food, good drink specials. Friendly management and most of the staff are friendly and efficient. Tara has always treated me like family! This bar has been my favorite for eight years and counting! P.S. Try the fried pickles! Mind blowing. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to some good Irish grub, unfortunately, it didn't happen here. The Shepherd's Pie \"gravy\" was watery and tasteless, and there wasn't much meat. The irish stew was cold and and bland. The wait staff was nice, but service was lacking. Everything took a long time, and the most disappointing was dessert. Though the bread pudding was good, we asked for ice cream on it,  and the waitress waited too long to bring it to our table so the ice cream was almost completely melted. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I come here in the afternoon when there is not a crowd. A good friend lives close by and she loves the fried pickles (which are quite yummy), so it's our meeting place of choice. They have my favorite cheap Irish whiskey, tullemore dew. We can always get a booth. The wait staff is attentive. I'll come back!"}
{"text":"I've never seen better service than what I was introduced with tonight. Busy, but my glass was never half full. Everyone so attentive. Kayla, Chris, and Krista the star of the show oh my goodness, were great in every aspect of the hospitality industry. Definitely making frequent visits!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to hang out! I was visiting my friend in the area and this was a fun place to go on Saint Patrick's day. There are specials were kind of pricey like $10 for a green tea shot which tasted just like a Tokyo Iced Tea and was too sweet.  I got a Moscow Mule in the copper mug and I thought it was adorable how my friend got a beer with a Guinness shot on the side in a little plastic shot glass that hung on it! They have Skee ball here and a Photo Booth! It's a very spacious area with a very fun crowd."}
{"text":"This my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!"}
{"text":"Use to be awesome...male bartenders that change your juke box entries is bs.. Our server Crystal was awesome..food was okay minus the old grease. I use to come here all the time but stopped because of the smell and bad service from male bartenders. Miss the beautiful women that use to take care of us. Pretty sad being Irish and these young fockers mess it up. No wonder people complain about it. Unbelievable! Just because Chris doesn't like certain music doesn't give him the right to cancel customers music. Stay away! Bullshit!"}
{"text":"This is the neighborhood Irish pub of choice in the area. I've been coming here for 30 years ( sweet lord I am old) , since my father brought me here for Irish nachos. The Guinness is not too cold, the jukebox is not too loud, the Jameson is reasonably priced and THE WATERS PLAY HERE. Sláinte! Also.  Devin maybe the best bartender in the world!"}
{"text":"Prob just a good place to drink, see live music. I've been many different times of day and days of week over the years. The food is always bad. The service varies. If you order a burger you're prob ok. Who can screw that up? Otherwise, drink, play darts, maybe meet some slutty Chics."}
{"text":"The \" Dub\" as my friends refer to it as is my local Pub that i roll when i just want to have a relaxed and fun  time.  Some of my favorite parts of the pub include the live music that is offerened almost 7 days a week and the nice variety of people who enter the establishment.  Friday and Saturday like most places is the Dubliner's busiest night when it is rather busy.  There are some things that could be improved on including better drink prices and more game options.  Overall this is a fun place but not the flashest or most hip.  The crowd is not always the most attractive either. but get a couple of Blue Moons in yah and even the 63 biker chick in the corner will start to look a little better"}
{"text":"The Dubliner is close to my house and pours a damn good Guinness.  Food is mediocre at best.  You might wait awhile for your drinks, but it does take time to pour a good pint.  I do have to run screaming from the building when they have Irish music nights.  As much as I love my people,  that high pitched little Irish flute thing they play makes me wonder if there are dogs all over the neighborhood being terribly disturbed.  Great neighborhood bar, food meh.  You can't really go wrong with an order of potato skins when you're drunk though....so there's that."}
{"text":"So normally I like this place and the corned beef and cabbage have been quite good... but, on this occasion, the chef was clearly not irish or familar with irish food & culture, because the dish was dreadful. How to you ruin corened beef a...nd cabbage?? The urge to tell them how to make it was a compelling one.   I'll go back because it's been decent in the past, and the beer flows freely and good, usually with good company, but, I'm thinking it's a one more chance kind of thing. Sadly, there are few places in phoenix that claim to be 'irish' that serve authentic quality irish food. I think if your going to cook food of another culture, you should at least learn how it's properly prepared and served."}
{"text":"This is a good home town watering hole. Great mellow/casual atmosphere to meet and hangout with friends. My friends and I have been going here as long as I can remember. The bar staff has largely remained the same for years; get to know em' and you'll know them for a long time. This is a pub of pubs. If you are looking for a \"home\" bar.. this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Always a good time at the Dubliner. We used to come here almost every Saturday night and while it is difficult to get a sitting or standing table, there is a lot of room to stand around, hehe. We usually end up playing darts or something. The staff is always polite and you can tell they like working there. That's always good. The beef stew is awesome. Bring on the fried pickles! The round ones are better, but they started doing spears, so hope that changes. Overall such a fun place!"}
{"text":"I'm 31 yrs old and I've come to the Dub since I was an 18 yr old with a good fake ID. I actually havent lived in Az in over 10 yrs, but when ever I come back to visit friends and family this is our spot. My buddies have been the local crew at this bar for over a decade. The bartenders have all worked here for years as well, and even tho i may only come in a few times a year, the bartenders always remember my face. A fun atmoshphere, plenty of room, a non-stuffy, non-scottsdale type crowd. When I'm in Az, I always visit the Dub..."}
{"text":"We've  had drink here a few times in the last year or so and the guinness is always just right on and service is normally pretty good.  Last night we went to Friday Night Fish Fry..... and I'm sad to say it was horrible. 1st we waited nearly an hour to get our food. My boyfriend had the Fish Fry and I had the Chicken Boxty. 2nd when our food finally arrived the fish was more fish jerky than fish fry. My Chicken Boxty was just sad.... I was given a plate of chicken gravy with a plain breakfast pancake covering it. Not a potato pancake like your traditional boxty. I picked through the pancake trying to find some potato and couldn't find any.  Needless to say I more or less had side of broccoli for dinner.  Unfortunately it is unlikely we will return after this."}
{"text":"My friend has brought me here a couple times, only on Mondays for trivia. Team Trivia is quiet entertaining, I must say. It's free to play, which is a nice bonus. If you want a good laugh, each team makes their own name up, some inappropriate, but funny though. I have ordered food, it's not bad, for bar food."}
{"text":"Full bar, happy hour specials and traditional Irish Fare. I've been twice and been happy each time. Husband got \"Boxty\" chicken in gravy folded in a pancake - its fantastic. I always get a garden salad with chicken, which is fresh, hearty and healthy. Happy to say this will be a regular stop for us! Service has always been good."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place two times now and have never had such bad service in any establishment. Worst place to come to and the music venue really sucks and doesn't match atmosphere. You are better off going to a chain restaurant than here. And on top of bad service, the food sucks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick couple of beers after work.  Michelle the waitress was fun and had a great attitude. Been a while since I've been there for a rowdy time. I should return on a weekend and relive some of those moments."}
{"text":"Truly kicking myself in the arse as I've been near this place for over a decade and just in the past year decided to stick my head in, the location/exterior just kept me away...    Food has been excellent.  Service has been great in my experience.  I believe I have ordered the daily special (either for lunch or dinner) that they advertise on a chalk board outside the door in every visit.  They make the best Chips!  The bar is cool the way it wraps around and divides the place into 2 distinct areas - they have darts, a couple decent TV's for the games, a small stage for live entertainment.  I just think the place is cool and I'm comfortable when I'm there - the food hooked me."}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine.  Doesn't look like much on the outside, but a suprisingly decent menu and full bar.  Always live music, which is my favorite part.  All types are welcome here, but it can get busy at times and they never seem to be staffed for it, so don't be too upset it it takes a while for your drinks.  If you're tired of the crowds that frequent the clubs in Scottsdale, want some good food and live music, you will have a great time at the Dubliner."}
{"text":"Came in, thought nice bar. First bartender was nice, came to table and was attentive. Second bartender came in, have not seen him. Have to walk around to dinning area to order my drinks. Then he just drops them off at end of bar for me to go get them. Hmmm... not the service I was expecting"}
{"text":"Fun place and cool staff! Good prices on beers! This is the best place in all of Phoenix to go to for St Pats day!!!"}
{"text":"I dig the Dubliner.  It is a great place to grab a bite and a brew while enjoying local, live music.  They have a great beer selection, full bar and an extensive (for a bar) food menu.  I have only had the sweet potato fries, but they were cooked to crispy perfection.  I wish I could give Dubliner more stars, but there are a couple of things that drive me bonkers about this place.  First and foremost,  there is always a mob of people sitting outside the front door smoking.  There is no way to circumvent the raunchy cloud of toxins.  I wish they would move the smoking area a few feet further from the door (maybe in the back/side parking area, hint, hint).  Also, on Friday and Saturday nights there are not enough servers here.  Service at the bar is usually prompt, but if you are at a table, good luck!  You are probably better off burning a calorie or three and walking to the bar for your next round, than waiting for a server to come to you.  It's not that they are slacking, there just aren't enough of them.  Add another server or two when the place is packed, get the smoke out of my face, then I'd up this to a four star rating.  Stop by the Dubliner, and support a local band/musician!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I went here, but I remember going a while back and seeing some live Irish music and having a good time.  I'll have to come back and check it out again."}
{"text":"Oi! The Dubliner!  Love this place. Short walk from my house, which is good after about 26 kiltlifters....  Best freaking wings I think I have ever had... like seriously, they have a magician back there.   Fun place, good people, good vibes. Never have seen any type of problems happen here which is rare for any bar in Phoenix.   This place has a very interesting dynamic. There are old heads and regulars and then a younger crowd. Makes for great conversations and social interactions. Bartender is cool, Dave I think.   Don't change your ways Dubliner..."}
{"text":"They've expanded this place a bit since I was here last and it definitely moved it from a 2 1/2 to a solid 3 1/2 to 4 star kind of place.  In a strip mall (gee, who's surprised) in a North Phoenix suburb (Ok, now you can be surprised!), you wouldn't expect this place to be as cool as it is.  Food served all day, and everything we've tried is pretty good (Great looking fries!).  As great as it is to get Irish pub food all day long, it is great to watch the place transform from a sleepy lunch spot to a packed standing room only spot around the time the entertainment gets going at 9pm.  It's generally traditional Irish music, but the night we were there he also did a 50's song and we swear he was playing music from the Godfather as we moved on to our next destination.    Lots of tables for big parties - which ours was (though the largest that night must have had 24 or more) and a great big wrap around the back bar.  The bar is one of their improvements - looks like they took over some extra space to expand since I'd been there years ago.  Several of us commented on how much bigger it looked and how much nicer it felt.  For some the downside is that this isn't a fancy \"Scottsdale\" bar, but on the upside - this is NOT some fancy schmancy \"Scottsdale\" bar.  You'll have folks of ALL ages there based on when you go.  And all shapes and sizes.  I kinda like that - you know, people looking like people.  Over the years we've been there, everyone seems to get along, just like the neighborhood pub it was meant to be.  Oh yea.  They have Guinness.  And Harp.  And Bass.  Beer and more beer.  That's not my thing so I can't really speak to it, but it is there in abundance.  Someone else will just have to stop by, have a pint and tell us all about it."}
{"text":"I only recommend this place during the off hours if your here for food. In my case that was between 4 and 5. We got good service, but I could sense if this place was busy, service would be a problem. That would be for food, but just getting something to drink, come anytime.  We were not ignored, but I felt the waitress should of check up on how we were doing just one more time.(not spoiled ok). Me and the wife both got fish and chips, plus slaw. Not bad, we both agreed. I would come here again, but as I said, only on the slow, off hours.   Bartender seemed to draw the crowd, as he was very charismatic as a whole. Majority of the crowd was between 45 and 65. Clean restrooms. Decor was average to slightly above average for a Irish pub. Don't let the outside look fool you. Lots of parking. Especially back further. Safe location."}
{"text":"I don't drink much, so I'm not dazzled by what is on tap. We came here to try a local Irish pub and see how their food was.  One star is too good for this place. I had the \"bangers and mash\". The quotes are necessary, trust me. My wife had -- we think -- the Shepherd's Pie. If the waitress had been attentive, we'd have asked. Since we weren't guzzling fermented piss, I guess we didn't rate on her radar. At least it wasn't terribly expensive.  I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"The food is freaking amazing but the service is decent. Super laid back bar that I totally dig, I just wish the servers were more attentive. I usually sit at the bar top and get amazing service. It was also a slow day when we went.. it was during happy hour and we still had to wait about 10 mins to get serve.. about 10 mins to get our food order in and about 20 mins after our meal to get the check. Also my boyfriend ordered a Budweiser and received a warm bud light. However hands down the best spinach dip in town!"}
