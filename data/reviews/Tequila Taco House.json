{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Montreal, and I know what Mexican is supposed to taste like, I'm from New Mexico. Everything is made in house, including the superb tortilla chips. The guacamole here is fresh and the chile is delicious. This place puts 3 Amigos to shame and it's open until 4am."}
{"text":"Me gusta! Petit resto avec menu typiquement mexicain. Il parrais banal mais tout est dans l'assiette. 

Parfois vide, parfois bonder! C'est un petit resto bien simple coté décor. Petite musique thématique. Les assiettes sont généreuse et délicieuse. Sa se rapproche beaucoup plus de la vrai nourriture mexicain que le old del paso. Les margaritas sont un must! Le staff est très gentil même si parfois ils ont l'air un peu trop relax. On s'en sort le bedon pleins avec une petite facture."}
{"text":"Really sweet and accommodating servers, a little more expensive than expected, but the Alambres tacos were tasty and I left feeling pretty full and satisfied."}
{"text":"These little hole-in-the-wall places are very easy to by-pass when looking for a nice place to eat.  If you skip over places like this, you can often miss out on some good food, so after passing by this place over the past several weeks, I ventured inside.

I decided to go with the tacos banderos or aka their version of fish tacos made with marlin and a serrano pepper, onion, and tomato salsa.  The meal comes with 4 tacos, though these are smaller versions of their larger cousins.  You get to choose 2 sides from rice, salad, or re-fried beans.  The tacos were supposed to be served with 3 sauces, but I only got 2.  

I'm not sure the fish tacos rate 4 stars, but I think they were better than 3 stars, so I'm giving them the higher of the 2 ratings."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos at an excellent price. The tortillas were soft and fresh and the filling (beef) was tasty and good. The beef was fresh and was nicely complimented by the bacon and sausage. The rice side was also excellent and I love the corn mixed in with the rice. The nachos / tortilla appetizer came with 2 fabulous salsas: one red and one green. Both little bowls were empty, we ate it all.

Even though I had tacos, I was not super thirsty andlooking to quench any  fires in my mouth. The margarita went great with the tacos. Quality.

I would back definitely if I am in Montreal. It's in a great location near St. Laurent and easy to get to. The service was very attentive, they work very hard for you. I enjoyed it 100%"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night, around 5:30, and it wasn't super busy. We were both starving, and decided to give it a try. I ordered the mango margarita (pretty good) and the shrimp tacos (forgot the official name, but the one with sauteed shrimp). The boy got a mojito and chicken tacos. The plates came with 4 tacos, as well as beans, rice, and a tiny salad (tomatoes, baby romaine, and Italian dressing). The shrimp tacos though... wowie! Haha. They were soooo good. I don't have the best tolerance for spice, so even without the hot sauce, I felt a kick from the heat. Like a party in my mouth lol. I don't eat certain meats, but the boy could testify that his were also yummy. The food came quick, the food was delicious, service was good, and the ambiance was casual but nice. Will definitely come back for the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a quiet Wednesday night and were hoping to get some good Mexican food after reading the reviews.  First off, the margaritas are a joke.  They are the most watered down cocktails that I've ever had anywhere.  Secondly, the guacamole that we ordered as our starter never arrived.  And worst of all, the enchiladas that the bf had contained small pieces of plastic (and who knows what else) resulting in nausea shortly afterwards and some serious vomiting the next morning.  The chicken fajitas I had were about one notch below mediocre.  This was the worst meal we had in Montreal."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly. All the Mexi standards are on the menu and prepared fresh. The plongueur needs to sneak some steal wool into the kitchen, though. Those pots and stove need some love."}
{"text":"disorganized service (several mistakes and problems)

Dry and loveless tacos for $13

stodgy greasy chips with oversalted guacamole

A cheap looking plastic menu with cheap tasting plastic food.

AVOID! Go to Grumann."}
{"text":"In town for a conference, my sister and I took a break to walk around Montreal on Friday afternoon. On our way back, we wanted to grab a quick dinner before the evening sessions started. We happened up on this restaurant on our long walk back.  Albeit skeptical at first because of their external decor (as others have noted!) that includes a laminated menu pasted on their door, we decided to give it a go. I'm glad we did.

Food
We both ordered the champignon (mushroom) tacos. A little while later, the waitress brought each of us a large plate that had 4 tacos with a side of refried beans and a green salad.The mushrooms were sauteed and flavored perfectly, topped with a yummy cheese and laid on a tasty corn tortilla. The refried beans were served with a little bit of grated cotija cheese and the salad was lightly dressed. Both were simple but tasty.

If you know me, you know that I'm a vegetarian taco snob, so finding tacos that I can rave about is something I don't take lightly!


Service
Our waitress was a local student from the university was really sweet, chatting with us and helping us with directions to the metro. ( The owner was also a sweet and smiley woman!)

Other thoughts

If you are a vegetarian who likes mushrooms, these tacos will do the trick! There are also some other items on the menu if you aren't in the mushroom-y mood. They also have a ton of tequilas and drinks on the menu that looked delish!"}
{"text":"Searching for an authentic Authentic Mexican restaurant in Montreal--- look no further!  Great food fantastic service and Salsa I'd wait an hour for. 
 Plus for veggie lovers, staff is very accommodating and will substitute beans in most dishes for you."}
{"text":"Have to agree with most of the posters here - this is the best Mex I have found in Montreal.  The cornerstone to the place being the fresh tortillas and salsas.  The server was super nice and brought more salsa without being asked.  The atmosphere and prices are a bit 'bistro' for my needs in a taqueria, but I'd go again."}
{"text":"It used to be really good. Now that they changed staff, it's a totally different place. Avoid it at all cost"}
{"text":"I try to use 1 star reviews sparingly, so I will give this restaurant 2 stars because the service was pleasant enough. I went here with a friend tonight, and have been regretting the decision to spend my money there ever since.

We started off the the queso dip appetizer. It was a congealed blob of flavorless grease that is sitting like a brick in my intestines.

I ordered the shredded chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans. I had to ask for salsa immediately to give the tacos flavor. The rice was cold and crunchy and the beans were thin and watery.

I am thinking that people who have given high reviews have never eaten real Mexican food. If you have, and you appreciate complex flavors, consider looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Juste au coin de chez moi, Le Tequila Taco a tout de suite attiré mon attention. 2 choses que j'adore : La tequila et la bouffe Mexicaine. 

+++ : La guacamole est super fraîche et citronnée comme je l'aime. Les tortillas, tacos, nachos et sauces sont toutes faites sur place, et ça paraît. Les portions sont énormes, assez pour un lunch le lendemain. La sélection de téquilas est impressionnante et mérite une séance de dégustation. Jamais trop de fromages ou de sauce dégoulinante. 

-bof : L'endroit est petit, on est pas super bien assis, super plein les vendredis & samedis soir. Ils ne prennent pas les réservations. Comparé a d'autres restaurants mexicains, c,est sur que les prix sont un peu plus élevés. Par contre, ca ne me dérange pas sachant que tout est fait sur place... 

Comme c'est près de chez moi, j'y vais pour la proximité et le goût plus frais qu'ailleurs. Le parking dans le coin est un peu difficile... !"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Austin, Texas. In Austin, this place would be pretty ordinary. In Montreal, where there is a serious lack of south of the border cuisine, this is a god-send for those craving the taco. 

I recommend the guacamole and any of the taco plates. The Tacos Asada and the Tacos Dorados are pretty tasty.  I haven't tried the enchiladas, as they are fairly expensive (In Texas, enchiladas are usually one of the cheaper menu items, here they are the most expensive). 

The margaritas are a bit weak, but they still give a taste of home.

Service was very good.

Overall solid."}
{"text":"Wow... What a pleasant surprise!

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Tequila Taco House because we were staying at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn.  All I can say is THANK GOODNESS we found this delightful little restaurant.

I absolutely LOVE Mexican food - authentic Mexican, not Tex-Mex, and Tequila Taco House is the real deal!  

I ordered a burrito and my boyfriend ordered enchiladas, I believe.  His enchiladas had a wonderful spicy kick to them, and my burrito was awesome.  The meat was perfectly seasoned, and everything was well-prepared.

The food is a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get a more than generous portion of food."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Authentic, great service, huge portions and good tequila selection.  I have dreams about this food."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venu au Tequila Taco pour la fete d'un ami. Très petit endroit charmant, peu de places assises, mais suffisant pour recevoir 1 ou 2 groupes de 10 personnes.
Un grand menu avec beaucoup de choix pour presque tout les goûts. Les plats étaient bien garnis et en bonnes portions.
Je demande à la serveuse quel genre de fruits de mer, elle me répond qu'elle ne sait pas, mais que ça sent le poisson.... sans aller vérifier
Niveau service, malheureusement c'était très long. 25 minutes pour recevoir notre premier verre, donc nous avons immédiatement commandé le deuxième pour ne pas avoir à attendre.
Pas une mauvaise expérience, mais pas de wow."}
{"text":"My family and I checked-in at the Hilton down the street, and we were starving. We also were in the mood for some yummy cocktails. 

We ordered the shrimp, tilapia, and pork (both kinds) tacos, as well as the chicken quesadilla and chicken burrito. Seriously, everything was amazing. The margaritas were okay; the shots were better. But beer is the best way to go. 

Az, the owner, was super friendly and could tell we were New Yorkers (because of our timid requests). We went back for dinner on our last day because we loved her and the food so much. 

Go, eat up and drink up. Tell Az that the New Yorkers sent you!"}
{"text":"I first tried this place several years ago shortly after they opened, and then it was quite tasty and worth going when in the area. However, lately I think it survives on location alone. The margaritas are a joke, we order a jug of them and we kept looking at each other seriously questioning if the bartender made them non-alcoholic for us! Watered down joke. While some part of the menu can be tasty, the meat is tough and dry. The service is really bad. Two girls were running around, but never seemed to really get anything done. Had to ask for stuff 3-4 times and virtually beg for service. We waited easily 30 minutes for our bill and were close to just guessing our total and leaving. Our server never bothered to come back after she dropped the bill to see if we needed change either. But wow, worst margarita I've ever had. Go to Itacate, forget this dump!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. 

I just went there for take out and got the chicken fajitas. I waited for an hour for my food, and was given free taco samples while I waited. This put the edge off of waiting a little bit. I get home, extremely hungry and ready to eat the chicken fajitas I once loved from this place.

I unpack the bag and see they forgot to give me my tortillas. I call and complain, the manager says he's too busy to talk and I politely said that next time just give me a double order of tortillas. I finally opened the fajita packaging and took a bite of chicken. It must have had a pound of salt on it. It's actually inedible. There was no presentation to the food, and the only side was old rice and beans.

I'm extremely disappointed with this place and the price isn't justifiable at all."}
{"text":"Great food a little pricey, but the tacos were Awesome! Street style 'taquieras' which means soft shell mini tacos with anything meat with cheese and guac-o-mole. I lie"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. I liked the chicken burrito the first time but wasn't crazy about the enchiladas the second time. Nice atmosphere and location and good service. I will continue my search for a great Mexican restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very good place for such a tacky name. Food is quite authentic and good and the atmosphere is nice. There lunch specials are a steal!"}
{"text":"Not exactly the most authentic Mexican food, but the shrimp tacos were effing yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little hole in the wall. My wife and I came here about half hour before they closed desperate for something to eat. 

The food was okay, I'd say really good if it were not for all the other amazing places in Montreal that have set my standard for that city so high. 

I got the Carnitas Tacos; good but the pork was a little tough and they could have used more seasoning. My wife had the Tortilla soup. She found the soup about average as did I. Definitely could have used fresh cilantro. I don't think there was any or much in it.

Tried to order some kind of beer but they were out of whatever it was I had wanted on tap. Just bottles. I was also annoyed because I was told by our server I could sub the rice and beans for soup, but then I got charged an extra $6 for my soup, same price as getting a soup off the menu."}
{"text":"This was my very first meal upon landing in Montreal and getting settled at my hotel.

It was quiet for a Wednesday afternoon and we were seated quickly. The waitress did her best to switch to English since we knew no french.

I had the Carne Asada tacos, my husband had pork tacos. The rices that came with each dish didn't seem like the kind you would get at a mexican restaurant but it was still good. 

They were alittle slow to get us the check and the prices were alittle steep but we were happy with our experience. 

Give Tequila Tacos House a shot."}
{"text":"En toute honnêteté, on s'est pointé là principalement parce que le nom du restaurant nous faisait bien rire et sans vraiment avoir d'attentes. De l'extérieur on dirait un endroit très ordinaire, et quand on rentre on découvre un petit local bien sympa et, à notre étonnement, assez peuplé! On s'installe donc au bar en attendant d'avoir une table pour manger et on regarde la carte des alcools. La liste des Tequilas est impressionnante et on s'y perd un peu; n'étant pas une grande fan de ce genre d'alcool je décide quand même de prendre un risque et y aller avec le même choix que mes amis ainsi que d'une recommandation de la serveuse: Un Margarita Tamarindo (un gout de pêche mais pas trop sucré, c'était très bon) et un verre de Beneva sur glace. Le prix a fait mal au coeur, mais je suis heureuse de voir que mon aversion pour la tequila n'était seulement du au fait que je n'avais pas encore gouté à de la BONNE tequila. Si vous êtes comme moi, je vous conseille fortement la Beneva; Elle a le goût très doux qui est très loin de celui de la Tequila Bang Bang (ha!). 

On finit par avoir une table pour manger, et on nous apporte des tortillas maisons couverte de fromage (qui je crois était du queso fresco? je dis peut-être n'importe quoi aussi, j'aurais du demander au serveur). On goûte, puis on les laisse sécher sur la table parce que bon, elles ne sont pas si formidable et le fromage est un peu lourd. Nos plats arrivent assez rapidement; j'avais choisi les Rojas Dulces (des enchiladas au poulet couverts d'une sauce de chile ancho et de cacao, un peu comme de la mole). C'était très bon, mais comme tout plat avec du poulet quand on tombe sur une bouchée pas de sauce, ça goutait sec et pas grand chose. 

Au final, nous avons tous bien appréciés nos plats, mais je crois que la cuisine mexicaine ne fait tout simplement pas parti de mes coups de coeur. À essayer par contre, pour l'expérience et le choix de Tequilas!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. It's certainly not fancy, but it isn't priced fancy either. In a montreal world of 3 Amigos and Mesa 14 this place pretty authentic. The food was tasty and the drinks were really good. 

I would go back!"}
{"text":"I was expecting small portions but I left this place full and with leftovers! (And that's saying a lot when I never take home leftovers, even from Greek and Italian restaurants where they tend to make it a mission to stuff you to the max). But the amount of food you get does depend on what dish. My companion ordered tacos and there didn't seem to be many of those on his plate. I ordered the last item listed on the lunch menu, the fajitas. The tortillas were warm and fresh. So here's a tip: if you're super hungry, the fajitas are possibly the best option. 

What I love about the lunch menu is that all the main dishes come with either soup or salad as entrée, and for dessert, coffee and a slice of chocolate cake (yes, both). So what initially seemed like higher-than-average menu prices are justified by the fact that so much more comes with the main dish. The soup was amazing! It is similar to a tomato soup, but with really soft, thin nachos and melted cheese. Nothing to complain about the coffee (though I really should have gone easy with the cream). My companion finished his main dish before me and had the slice of cake before me. When it was my turn to have dessert, by which time he was done with his, the waitress informed me that there was no more cake. But you know what? I was in luck that they didn't have cake! Why? Because they had a better alternative (at least for people like me who always want to try new things from foreign cuisines). Instead, they offered me what I believe is called sopaipilla. It's basically fried triangular pastries drizzled with some sweet syrup that looked like caramel, at least according to how they make it. Each bite of it was pure delight. 

The waitress was kind and smiley the whole time we were sitting and, moreover, apologetic about not being able to give me cake. Honestly though, I think I would have much preferred the sopaipilla anyway. If they hadn't run out of cake, I wouldn't have known about it. So cheers to that! 

Can't say much about the decor. There isn't much to see besides a painting or two. I did like how bright it was, but then aren't many Montreal restaurants like that due to windows that go from the ceiling to the floor, practically serving as an entire wall? I like the fancy restaurant sign out front."}
{"text":"Lorsque vous poussez la porte, le restaurant paraît tout petit, 34 places assises, dont 8 en comptoir.
L'accueil comme le service était très sympathique, les serveuses et le barman pas mal souriants... Quelque chose d'agreable, la serveuse à toujours eu un regard sur notre table et a été très serviable, disponible et rapide, sans venir nous interrompre pendant que nous avions la bouche pleine...
Une Margarita en apéritif (2 pour 1, mais c'est par personne) avec en accueil des tortillas (chips mexicaines), nappées de fromage et accompagnées de deux sauces pas mal relevées.
Les fajitas délicieuses, le tout servit dans une poêle chaude, le riz, la viande (buf ou poulet pour nous) mélangée avec légumes, le tout était encore en ébullition, de la crème fraîche et du guacamole pour napper les galettes (4 par personnes).
Et pour finir, en dessert, des \"pastels impossibles\", un gâteau au chocolat recouvert d'un flan, arrosé de caramel.
Avec l'addition (58$ pour deux avant tips et taxes), deux verres de téquila en cadeau.
Je ne sais pas ce qui était maison ou pas, mais hormis les Margaritas qui n'était pas très fortes, la soirée fût bonne, autant en goût qu'en accueil...
Honnêtement, j'y retournerai sans problème et ferait même de la publicité.
Il y a même une grande table carrée de 8 personnes, vaut mieux peut-être réserver, le restau est vite plein et pourtant, nous étions un dimanche soir de janvier, veille de reprise."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night with friends. An ok lookin place at St Laurent & Sherbrooke. The food is Ok too. Nothin phenomenal. Maybe coz places like El Rey Del Taco have set pretty high standards for Mexican food for me in Montreal. Service is super slow. They do have a long list of cocktails on their menu. Their Guacamole was ok. Also tried their Tacos al Pastor. I found the pork to be a bit tough. Also the tacos were chewy at the edges. I was not impressed. 
Do I wanna taco bout it?      Nooo.......Its nacho problem


Food -  Ok
Service - Friendly  but slow
Ambiance - Casual
Worth the money - I'd say so"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place in my honest and humble opinion.

My fajita was too salty, with lots of cheese, no flavor and spice to it. Rice were not fresh and I can go on and on for every single thing....

I had Mexican food at a lot of places, that was definitely a shock for me."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  After reading all the other reviews we thought we would give this place a try.   Don't judge a book by its cover comes to mind when you see the storefront.   Walking up to it we were at first skeptical that this place would have yummy tacos-- it looked run down and dark.. 

The tequila tacos were great, fresh salsa made it pop.  The guac and chips were good as well.. Freshly made chips and guac.  The carnitas were good as well."}
{"text":"Pas impressionné par le service ni la place, ni les nacho.  Nous n'avons pas pris la peine de commander et sommes répartis!"}
{"text":"Nice to see a place more mexican than tex-mex. The food was not as spicy as I would have liked. The guac was great. I had the Tacos Asada  and enjoyed it a lot.  I told the waitress that YELP was what brought us there. She had never heard of YELP, which I am finding is pretty common. I let her read a few reviews on my phone, and she seemed pretty pleased with what most of you said about the place. I told her the manager should definitely get YELP to follow up on some of the concerns that are mentioned as well.  as we were paying the bill, I noticed the waitress seemed to be downloading YELP on her phone. I would definitely go back, and this time I will try the burritos."}
{"text":"A small place on the corner of Sherbrooke and St Laurent, it has a nice laid back atmosphere. I've been twice and enjoyed it both times, but they changed the menu between my two visits, and they no longer have the fish taco on the menu, but it is still available in limited quantities if you ask. Good value a little bit south of the busiest spots on St Laurent."}
{"text":"The service was great, thought the meat did not have a real Latin taste, it was still applaudable. I gave it 3 stars because the drinks tastes as if they were watered down. I hope they correct that."}
{"text":"This place is good. Not super, and not bad either. It's one place you can get good, standard Tex-Mex dishes that also has a full bar and seating. Margarita pitchers were good, as were the tacos. It was good, but next time will be checking out Le Tequila Bar or Itacate for comparison."}
{"text":"I've probably walked by this restaurant over 1000 times in my life. Never even thought of walking in until last night. My friend wanted Mexican and we were right near there. Walked into the place and it was almost full. 

I ordered nachos to start and they had a great twist on them. Not too sure what the spread on them was but it was great! My main dish was the shrimp tacos and they were really awesome!

Only downside was the pre-made margarita."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! As close to the real thing as I've found in Montreal, it's decently priced and the staff is super friendly. Also very fast service."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the first time two days ago and I'm already craving their Tacos Dorados! In fact, since I walked out of that place I have gushed about it to at least four people. The number would have been higher had I had more friends. 

Their menu was somewhat confusing to me because I wasn't familiar with Mexican cuisine; sadly all I know of it is the yellow boxed Old El Paso kits I usually buy at the grocery. Thankfully the waitress made a suggestion, which was the Tacos Dorados, which was pretty much the ground beef tacos. But it was so much more than ground beef tacos. Everything that they put on that platter... the guacamole, the bean thing, the actual tacos, the rice... it was a winning combination. I loved every bite of that dinner. 

Ambiance was also very pleasant. It was small (so don't come in a group of 20) and I believe every table was occupied, but it wasn't noisy in an annoying way. I definitely recommend this place even if you're not a fan of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Since coming from San Diego, CA, my husband and I have hunted for authentic Mexican food in Montreal.  After going to Carlos & Pepe's (worst Mexican food ever, even the salsa was terrible), and then 3 amigos (marginally better), we didn't have much expectation for this place, even though it was highly recommended. 
The location is very easy to find, as it is next to Lolita's, and the decor was all right. We ordered taco pastores and a carne asada burrito.  Although the taco pastores was decent, the sauce tended to be a bit on the sweet side, the carne asada burrito was terrible.  First of all, a real carne asada burrito does not have rice in it.  Rice is simply a filler so that they can give you less meat.  Also, the meat was not properly marinated, so the meat was not at all tender & flavorful like a real carne asada burrito is supposed to be.  The one really good thing was their spicy salsa, hands down. 
Finally, the price for the dishes was a bit much for the amount of food that you get.   We ate dinner around 7, but got hungry at around 9:30...its totally not worth the price you pay.  We're probably not going to go back and will still continue looking for a real Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Ce matin, mon père m'a envoyé un texto pour ma rappeler que dans 3 mois exactement, je serai au Mexique! Par pure coïncidence, hier soir en soupant à Tequila Taco House, je trouvais que les épices qu'ils utilisent dans leur nourriture ressemblaient le plus à ce que j'avais goûté lors ma première visite au Mexique, surtout si on compare avec des restos \"Tex-Mex\".

J'ai eu la chance de goûter aux tacos aux champignons et aux nachos \"salsa verde\". J'adore les champignons et je ai été comblée par ces petits tacos délicieux qui sont aussi un peu trompe l'oeil - bien qu'ils soient petits, après seulement deux, donc la moitié de l'assiette, j'étais pleine! Les nachos quant à eux avaient l'air d'une oeuvre d'art et me faisaient penser aux lattes avec des designs. Au départ, je n'était pas certaine par où commencer tellement ils étaient remplis mais après quelques instants, j'ai trouvé un p'tit coin de chip pour débuter la destruction de l'assiette de nachos.

Quand la facture est arrivée, j'ai aussi été bien contente du prix. Puisque je partageais le repas avec mon copain, pour moins de 30$ on a satisfait notre envie de bouffe mexicaine jusqu'à ce qu'on se retrouve au Mexique pour de vrai!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Lots of choices for a vegetarian and the prices were right. Even though the place was busy, the service was great, fast and my food was quite tasty. My shrimp tacos were yummy but could have been spicier though given the warning they came with!

I'd definitely come back and I'd have to say that it's better than the other Mexican options in the city."}
{"text":"Can't say I agree with previous reviews. I found the tacos lacked taste / spice, and the service was very slow. Sure it is a cheap eat, but for good Mexican food I would go somewhere else.

Maybe I caught them on a bad night? Still don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food in Montreal? Yes way! It may be, by default, the best Mexican restaurant in Montreal. I have very high standard when it comes to Mexican food, having spent 3 years in California.

The food was quite flavorful and felt quite authentic. I had the beef fajitas. Our waiter was very nice and attentive although he messed up my order. Anyhow, I will be back whenever I have a craving for Mexican food."}
