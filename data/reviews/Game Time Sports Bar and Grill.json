{"text":"This place is a little gem of a bar. It is really nice inside with lots of seating. Its all wood paneling inside which lends itself to a cozy and comfortable atmosphere. The bartender just couldn't be nicer. I got a bloody Mary and it was fantastic. Its a little or if the way but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little bar with friendly bartenders and my burger was the best I've had so far in the Madison area."}
{"text":"The menu is small but the drinks, food,  and service are grand!    We ordered a mixer, BLL, nacho burger, cheeseburger,  and fries all for $25 plus tip.   The bartender/cook was very accommodating with the mixer drink order seeing as we didn't know what we wanted,  he made a delicious and visually appealing drink in the fly.  They also have 4 beers on tap (Leiney, Bud light,  Miller, and Spotted cow).  We watched the Brewers game on one of five big screen TV s as well as our cook making our burgers with fresh,  raw ground beef that he molds with his hands before slapping it onto the sizzling grill.   The burgers come with chips and a pickle,  or you can upgrade to fries for $2.25. We chose to order basket of (krinkle) fries for $4.  The burgers were mountainous heaps of deli fresh soft buns,  lettuce and tomatoes (optional), cheese, and fixings.    I've never heard of nacho burgers before and now I wonder why no one else has them.  It came with black olives,  jalapenos,  warm nacho cheese, and bi-colored nacho chips! Simply phenomenal!  An explosion of flavors in your mouth.  We both commented on how juicy and flavorful the beef patties were.    The bar and grill had decent amount of people on a Saturday night with more traffic arriving and only two staff.  They held their own and still delivered friendly and attentive service.  I say, skip the chains in Greenway Station and presumptuous food on Parmenter St and saddle up at the Game Tome Bar & Grill!"}
{"text":"Beyond bar food. Awesome eats at great prices. I got a wicked fish sandwich with chips for 6.95. it was lightly bread, huge chunk of fish, American cheese... All you ever want. Staff is friendly. It's a sports bar but welcome to non sport fans like myself. There are a few bar games and juke box. Crowd is mostly middle age or older."}
{"text":"Quite honestly the best burger served in an up north paneled bar with friendly people. Recently we went there on a Friday night.  The fish fry was great. The cheeseburger was a real standout. It smelled good on the grill and was very tasty. The perfect char, done right. I thought my mother was in the kitchen. (Yes she invented the perfect cheeseburger starting with butcher ground steak on a cast pan).  Seriously a contender for top 5 in the Madison  metro area.  Oops almost forgot to mention the above average brandy old fashioned sweet drinks. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Fun bloody mary bar. If you like to ride bikes to a bar that's out in the country, but not too far out, this is a great choice. Also good for autumn rides out to watch a Packer game."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and a drink. Bartender got us drinks and took our order relatively quickly. Unfortunately, he never actually put our order in. I went back to the bar to inquire on our food order and get another round of drinks as we had been waiting a half an hour for two appetizers. Bartender figured out he'd never placed our food order. He made sure to charge us for all our drinks but never took ownership of his mistake, apologized, or made any attempt at making things right, as a professional bartender/server would surely do. This was my first, and last, experience at this place."}
{"text":"Small bar but cozy. All high top tables and TV screens available but not everywhere in your face.  I had a pretty phenomenal burger and my significant others fish fry wasn't bad. You wouldn't have to twist my arm to get me back here.   (I got the black and blue burger with fried onions. Very tasty and the bun was perfect. I'm big on good bread with my burgers and this was fabulous.)"}
{"text":"Game Time has one of the best burgers in the Madison area. Seriously - we've tried just about them all. Flavorful meat, never dried out, toasted bun, great sautéed mushrooms and grilled onions as add-ons. They also have a great gyro pita sandwich with onions and their house made tzatziki sauce. They heat the meat on the grill and it's a great sandwich.   My favorite is their French dip. It's not on the regular menu but is a special a couple of times a week. It comes with onions, mushrooms, and Swiss, and since they sauté it all on the grill, it's almost like a cross between a cheesesteak and a French dip. But it's the best one I've had in madison.   To top it off, the fries are fantastic. The servers/bartenders are friendly and efficient, and although it's clearly a tavern, and not high end dining, it's a great inexpensive meal and well worth the drive out past Middleton."}
