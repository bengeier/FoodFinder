{"text":"Disclosure: I am not kosher. I was vacationing with a kosher friend, and so we were limited to kosher establishments. I absolutely prefer mainstream restaurants.

That said, after an absolutely terrible experience at Haifa kosher restaurant, we found our way to Kosher on the go. The dining room is nothing to look at. Just a few tables, and probably no-one else there (I think they do a lot of \"to go\" food, thus the name). However, if you are looking for \"mama's\" home cooked dining, then this is the place for you. The food was delicious (even for kosher). The owner/manager/server was warm and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good reasonably priced kosher food."}
{"text":"I ordered a catering for my company to the convention center and not only was it there in less 40  min by mistake I ordered the wrong dish they switched it out for me no problem and the food was amazing. I would only give this place 5 starts and it's the only kosher place in vegas I would recommend. Vegas kosher food has a very bad reputation. Dont under estimate Vegas kosher food bec of other people's bad values."}
{"text":"We ordered catering for a weekend in Las Vegas and we are speechless. We got much more than we order, everything was packed and organized and most importantly was very tasty and fresh!
Yafa is a lovely and kind women, because kosher on the go our weekend was fantastic."}
{"text":"Very impressed with everything! Myself and friends were in Vegas for a Jewelry show and needed food delivered to our hotels for Friday night and saturated lunch since we couldn't get out they delivered and they made everything so easy we were thrilled with the service. THEN THE FOOD CAME and o wow was it unbelievable they gave us 12 different types of salads and 4 main dishes and spicy chilly that was amazing called \"Schug\" its this green crushed pepper that is sooo good. 
then we ate there 2 different times and were equally impressed with servece and food hence this glowing review! thank you  K"}
{"text":"I went to Yaffa's Palace New Restaurant Sunday night with my husband and our 3 children. the service was excellent and the food was amazing! We all go the Mongolian Bar which was perfect since my kids got to chose what they wanted and how they wanted it! I would definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"the food here is beyond awesome!!!!! my daughter is orthodox and eats strictly kosher and i like good food and normally kosher does not taste good to me.. wow, kosher on the go changed my thoughts about kosher food!!!!! i had the best stir fry i have ever had in my entire life!!!!! my daughter has been craving mexican food but hasn't been able to find any kosher mexican food until kosher on the go, she had the steak enchiladas with black beans and rice was excellent . the price is very reasonable, the service excellent, i will go back with my non-kosher friends to treat them to something awesome!!"}
