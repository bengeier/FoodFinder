{"text":"Red House Cafe serves Hong Kong style Western food.  We came last Saturday for an affordable dinner.  We ordered a sizzling chicken and pork mixed steaks set dinner ($11) and a grilled sirloin steak set dinner ($9).  The set dinners came with bread rolls, soups of the day and hot beverages.  The soup was a bit diluted, a bit salty and surprisingly had no or very little MSG.  The bread rolls were heated up by microwave and were a-OK.  All the steaks were over cooked.  They were marinated to soft.  The meat texture was compromised, but this treatment was very typical in Hong Kong style Western restaurants.  The meat also seemed to have been frozen for a long while, but it was not spoiled in any way.    Nothing about the food overly disappointed me, except for the steak sauces.  The sauces tasted dated, thicken by flour and not tasty.  Red House Cafe reminds me of the Goldsor Restaurant at the Times Square in Richmond Hills, except Goldsor has better sauces.  In the end, we were full and found the meal very inexpensive.  Overall, 2.5 stars.  If they can refresh the sauces, then it deserves 3 stars."}
{"text":"Normally I would have the daily special which is gravy with chicken steak. I'm not a fan  of the restaurant + the customer service is absolutely terrible. I've had better experiences at other hk style cafes."}
{"text":"This is one of the three Hong Kong Style cafes in this plaza right at the corner of Kennedy and Bur Oak.  The lunch special menu here is quite limited to just a handful of choices but you can always order from the regular menu.  Full of high school students so noise level can be quite high.  My lunch for $4.99 that includes a drink is ok, great for a light lunch.  The seating is quite comfortable and with free Wifi access just ask for the password.  Afternoon tea set has way better selections so I probably be back for that instead of lunch.  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Cheapest and BEST Steaks in Toronto!!!!!! For 8 dollar tax and tip included, you get a huge 13 ounce steak dinner. The steak was best I have tasted, perfectly done to a medium rare. Definitely worth a trip to try out. I havent tried anything else on the menu, because every time I go, I always end up ordering the steak."}
