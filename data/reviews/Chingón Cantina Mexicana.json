{"text":"This place is by far the most authentic Mexican you will find in the north shore! Great decor, and knowledgeable staff. We tried many different items such as chorizo quesadilla, chicken tacos, mole enchiladas and the suiza enchiladas. All we're very good and their yucca fries are a must!! Their prices are decent & fair and they also offer specials such as taco Tuesdays and margaritas & beer are on discount on Thursday. Over all a good experience and will return."}
{"text":"My family and I ate there last night to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant looks great and the staff was very friendly. We were seated on the terrace.  I do recommend that you check the menu online beforehand. Their menus at the restaurant are not very descriptive. The website also offers photos of the food. But be careful as there are 2 different menus floating around online. RestoMontreal has a menu posted that offers items not found on the menu inside the restaurant.  The food was amazing! I did feel that the guacomole artesano was lacking in flavour and I wasn't a huge fan of the creole rice. I ordered the enchilada suiza and it was fantastic.  The only reason I am not giving a full 5 stars is because of the tiny red spider problem we had at our table. I must have killed 10 that I saw on my husband or his chair and we kept finding more after we had left the restaurant.  I will definitely be returning. Soon."}
{"text":"A newly open restaurant with beautiful & very hip decor. Invitons terrasse to prolong your evenings among friands.  Staff is extremely courteous & very professional. Very helpful in guiding you through the simple but good menu.  A good selection of drink, cocktails & beers. Orders are processed in a timely fashion & the food is delicious, kind of A fusion cuisine.  A must try if you are passing through St-Eustache.  Price wise varies between 10$ & 40$. I would definitely recommend it & will go back."}
