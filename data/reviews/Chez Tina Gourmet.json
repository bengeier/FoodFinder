{"text":"La nourriture est bonne, mais c'est très cher et le service n'est pas du tout bon! C'est dommage... Good food (but pricy) bad service"}
{"text":"Muy mal servicio, porciones pequeñas y precios altos. El restaurante es pequeño y la ropa y el cabello quedan impregnados a olor a grasa."}
{"text":"J'ai partagé avec mon amoureux une entrée d'empenadas succulents: pâte croustillante avec grains de maïs concassés servi avec une petite salsa maison. Comme plat principal: porc effiloché servi sur une pâte de tomates et poivrons, et salade verte au parfum de lime rafraîchissante. La cuisine maison de Tina est simplement bonne et réconfortante. Très belle découverte!"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal on vacation with my husband and after 8 days of French food we were ready for a change.  Chez Tina delivered big time!   We started with the Empanadas.  They were good. He ordered the Carne Asada and I ordered the Coconut fish. They were both excellent. The steak was juicy with excellent seasoning and came with rice, salad, and a plantain.  The total bill was under $40.00 Canadian. I wish I could a great dinner like this for that price in New York!"}
{"text":"We don't recommend this place. There is nothing gourmet about this restaurant. The food was mediocre and not enough ventilation making the place smell like fried food. Not much seasoning in the food, and most of what we ordered was not originally made in the restaurant. Very little importance to the quality and the presentation of the food. An example of this were the arepas that were heated there but came from a package. The fried plantain was not ripped enough. The avocado was served with the skin on it. The juices  also come from concentrated frozen containers. It was very expensive for the quality. We were surprised that a restaurant like this is able to survive in Montreal. Extremely Disappointed."}
{"text":"Un petit voyage tout en restant à Montréal. C'est la deuxième fois que je mange ici et je suis entièrement satisfaite. La bouffe est excellente est le service est très bien. J'adore pouvoir y pratiquer mon espagnol. Essayer le ceviche de camarones, juste miam miam."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal last weekend and we stopped here for lunch on Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is small but has a nice ambiance. I came with a group of 8 and we had no problems finding seating though.   Food: The  Bandeja Paisa...huge mixture of food on a platter, consisted of chorizo sausages, bed of excellent rice, red beans, fried egg, fried pork rind, grilled steak...possibly the national dish of Columbia. It was done very well. Outstanding seasoning. Others in my party ordered the pork chops or fried fish. Everything was done well.   Prices were $10-$20.   Service was fast and the owner was very friendly. I highly recommend Tina's."}
{"text":"Had one of the worst experiences as a client in a restaurant in Montreal, but will try to stay as objective as possible. First of all the restaurant is a small family owned place, they seem to lack organization to handle groups regarding their capabilities. We were told to order before the rest of our group arrived even though we wanted to wait for them, when the restaurant was full around 7 pm -saturday- the waiters were really stressed and the way they treated us was far from professional. Food took forever to arrive, food quality was ok, honestly there are better Colombian places out there.   At the end, they had problems splitting the bill for our group and paying was a mess, to the point the restaurant owner started to yell at my wife when there was a difference in our bill. Not smooth Chez Tina, not smooth.  I give them 1 start just because it's not possible to give less. Would never go back  Como Colombiano, decepcionado de este sitio, muy mal servicio,  poca paciencia de parte de todo el personal y en un punto hasta groseros. Comida muy normal para el servicio que ofrecen.  No volveré ahí.    C'était une mauvaise expérience,  leur staff manque de patiente et parfois ils étaient méchant avec notre groupe de 9 personnes, la bouffe était OK, je ne recommend pas ce restaurant."}
