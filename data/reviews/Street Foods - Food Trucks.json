{"text":"Something about taco trucks but an Indian food truck??? Definitely caught my attention while walking towards Wynn. A little hesitant to try at first but I must say I was surprised at how authentic and traditional the Indian food tasted. Mexican food was great as always but my friends and I loved the nachos the most. We loved them so much we decided to come back after a long night of partying, and nothing beats tacos and nachos after a wild night. Quick service, delicious food, cheap prices, all available 24 hours!!! Can't walk away from that!"}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas for a convention and had just about an hour to grab a quick bite to eat. I have eaten at many places in las vegas but as usual you need to drive and park/give your car to valet and then walk a bit to get to a decent quick restaurant. I was driving near the peppermill area and as usual the wait was out the door, but to my luck i saw this food truck right across the parking lot. Being from Chicago i am a TRUE food truck lover.... So i decided to try this place out.   TO MY SURPRISE, not only were the tacos AMAZINGLY FRESH but also really light and non greasy so i would not feel guilty if i ate more. I ended up grabbing me a combo plate and a pineapple jarritos. The combo comes with 3 tacos ( you can choose from carne asada, pork or chicken) and a side of rice and beans. The price for all of that was under 10$ which made me very happy being in a city where you are more than likely to  loose money. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner inside the shop, where they sell drinks and ice cream , and as per his recommendation i also ordered the carne asada fries. ( I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THOSE FRIES)  I was so happy with all of the food and the taste was amazing that i had to share my joy for this place. The owner was telling me how they are planning on adding more food trucks with different cuisines so i will definitely be back to check those out next time i am here."}
{"text":"Incredible Carne n Chicken Tacos!!! Open All Nite. Perfect for after the club or all day for that matter. These non greasy well seasoned tacos are to die for no doubt! Gym Rat Approved!!! #fittacos #greatfood #astripexperience #streettacos"}
{"text":"Yummy! Well done! The trucks are new and clean. Order inside the small building (they have the menus on the wall in there too) and then pick up the food at the truck window.  I got the steak quesadilla, it was made fresh to order. I got a side of cool sour cream and FIERY salsa.  The salsa was crazy good but its not for the weak!  Serious heat. Fresh made and pure pepper taste.  It's very nice to have a good eats option that have late hours. Quick walk just North of the Wynn and on the same side of Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Tacos are very good and ordering was easy. I sometimes struggle to order at a food truck because I don't speak Spanish and don't eat onions. Usually I ask them to hold the onion and get onions anyway. This was easy though. I ordered with no onions and that's what I received and the tacos were very good.   But what I really liked was an Indian food truck. I've never seen that before. Indian food is a favorite of mine so I had to try it. It wasn't better than the best Indian restaurant in town but it was better than some for sure. It was fast and priced right and tasted authentic. It's nice to have variety. I do enjoy truck tacos but it's refreshing to have options especially the option of delicious hearty Indian dishes. The Indian food felt clean and healthy and I will be back."}
{"text":"Overrated and weird.  You don't order at the food truck.  You order inside.  Then when the food is ready you have to pick it up at the truck.  We got burritos because they didn't have rice to get one of their indian dishes.  The burrito was just ok.  In my opinion, No better than let's say a taco bell or something.  I've had much much better food truck food."}
{"text":"As mentioned in my Yelp profile I'm a big fan of the Mexican cuisine so when I heard of this place it was immediately bookmarked. I have to say this is on my top 3 list of places to go for Mexican food. Their ingredients are incredibly fresh, flavors are on point, service is friendly and quick, but most of all food is AUTHENTIC and that can be something hard to find on the Las Vegas strip. Last but not least parking can be a hassle on the strip, but these guys got the perfect location. No hassle whatsoever. Can't wait to bring all my friends after drunken fun nights."}
{"text":"These guys are the best stop on the strip fast service cheap prices and good customer service I recommend these guys all day and will eat there again."}
{"text":"YEAH!!!! 5 STARS!  Mexican food and Indian food available.  Everything is flavorful and fresh. It's located right next to peppermill. Staff us nice as f*ck and food is amazing. I guess it's been open only 2 months. Yeahhh, I'll be here every other day for sure.  Late night food spot for the hustlers and tourists. This place is A1 promise"}
{"text":"Okay,  So if you go, MAKE SURE Raul is working. He actually knows how to serve it up. Delicious and fresh. Not greasy like Roberto's. Not to mention the wait is like MAYBE 8 minutes. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Lovveeee this place! Great tasting food and amazing service! Quick and delicious!! Don't miss out..super convienent and located in a fun and stable environment!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good! Little cheaper than most. Good quick place to grab something to eat. Carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Tried both food trucks: Taco Truck & Indian Truck Seems like both were owned by the same people.  There are no instructions on how to order and where to pay until you step up to a truck and then someone tells you to pay and order in the storefront.  We walked in and asked the cashier about the different Indian dishes and she looked and acted as if she had somewhere better to be.  Another couple were in the storefront eating Indian food so we asked her about their order...she responded saying its masala curry, it has potatoes and it's good.  We asked if the masala came with anything else I.e. Roti or Naan etc.  She replied: everything that you see there.  Now, normally I'd walk right out the door after giving her a few tips on customer service but I was hungry, tired and really wanted to try the Indian food.  So, I politely (still) said okay, we will take a masala and a 3 taco combo (2 pollo, 1 carne asada).  We walked back out to the trucks and waited for the food.  We decided to eat at the storefront.  So, here's the scoop...  Tacos: flavorful chicken and steak but DRY!!   Beans and rice..meh, nothing to write home about.  1/2 Star for the flavor.  Masala: curry had a good flavor but very watery, meh sides (roti with curried potatoes folded inside).  1/2 Star for the flavor.  Final verdict: skip the trucks and find another spot to eat at...at least until they fix a few things.  First thing to fix = the help!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos period!   Absolutely a must if your in Vegas!!! Right on the Vegas Strip!!  Very friendly staff and the service is top notch!"}
