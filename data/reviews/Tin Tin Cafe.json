{"text":"A new place in Richmond serving comfort food, and it is surely comfort food at its best. It was a bit disorganized when they first opened but we gave it a second chance last night, and was so glad we did. It seems like they renovated the place, so the environment is clean and comfortable. Price is good. Service is good. I will definitely be back when I am in a need of a carb overdose."}
{"text":"I liked the food a little better than the Toyoma restaurant down the road. The pricing was kinda expensive when they first open but they're having a 30% off hibachi and teriyaki dinners right now so it's pretty straight. The sushi is not bad, I tried a couple rolls. The only problem I found with the sushi is it all tasted the same to me. There wasn't anything wow about it so I kept ordering other rolls. The crab Rangoon was pretty good. Would recommend for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"The good and service was great. They have a decent selection of sushi and the hibachi was great. The prices were pretty good for the quality of food highly recommended."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here for takeout on your lunch break! Unless you want to spend the entire time WAITING for food. Not a first time diner, but not exactly my \"go to\" lunch spot either, I stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was practically empty except for two or three tables. So I ordered Teriyaki shrimp noodles with mushrooms and zucchini lunch special. Easy enough right? NOT EXACTLY...Spent half my lunch break waiting 25 minutes!!  What's worse is it was like this each of the two or three times I've been in. Staff seemed so nonchalant and complacent with no sense of urgency. What's the deal!?! From what I can see you could use the business. There are comparable restaurants like Thai Taste, Chen Fu, etc 5 minutes away that manage EXTREMELY BUSY lunch crowds AND complete a carry out order in 10 minutes or less. Never again Tin Tin!! Get with the program!!"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Super fresh and bursting with flavor! I just love the noodle dishes.  I wish  that I had the capacity to do their menu justice as everything that we've tried has been spot on. The staff are friendly and I've found a new weekly staple.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I come here all of the time and have no idea why it is never packed. I lived in Japan for a long time and to me it's hard to find a good, quick service sushi/hibachi place. This place is seriously amazing. They have both great traditional rolls and fantastic creative and unique rolls. Service is quick and extremely courteous and the ambiance is gorgeous.  I hate writing reviews (unless they're bad ) but wanted to make sure to make people aware of this relatively new restaurant. It's tucked in with the Jimmy John's and Baskin Robins, so it's easy to miss. This is one of my favorite go-to places and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the University area. The sushi is very good, and the ramen is quite good as well. One of the best in Charlotte - and pretty much the only decent ramen in the University area.   I've been there a few times as well as ordered sushi takeout. The sushi has been good each time. I've only ordered the ramen once, but it was quite good. The noodles won't hold up to takeout though so if you're ordering it to go I'd suggest substituting with a sturdier noodle when you order.  The exterior of the restaurant itself is in an unassuming strip center, but the inside is very nice so don't be fooled. The service is friendly, though the sushi can take a little time when you order it, but always worth the wait. They have wifi available through TWC so if you are already a TWC user you can easily get online.  They really have an interesting menu, but I've found it hard to tear myself away from the sushi long enough to try many other items. So far my favorites are both the Spider Roll and Spider Man Roll as well as the Crazy Hot Roll. I can't wait to sample my way though other options. There are a variety of hibachi and noodle dishes as well as some Chinese and others."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE  WORST SERVICE EVER  It took over an hour for my food to come just for my order to be WRONG.  The staff is horrible, they do not know what is going on. I specially told them 3 times my order just to have it gotten wrong.  I am pretty sure there is only one chef for the place which it took forever for my food to come.  I do not recommend anyone to try this \"new\" place.  There are many places with better food and service in this area.    If there was a no star I would pick that."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Lunch combos were filling and good price point for an entree, soup and drink.  Only thing missing in my meal - Taiwanese fried salted chicken was some vegetables.  Only came with rice and chicken.  Maybe I'll ask for a side of veggies next time.  Otherwise, pretty good, relatively clean and quaint."}
{"text":"I went there 4 times. The curry sauce is delicious , good calm atmosphere. . We went there for Karaoke nite as well."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and appetizers! We ordered from Tin Tin for the first time today and we were NOT disappointed! The two rolls we ordered (Creamy Roll and Crunch Shrimp Roll) were excellent, but the appetizers were phenomenal. Delicious crab rangoon and salt-and-pepper calamari made the meal exceptional."}
{"text":"So enjoyed the courteous service and pleasant atmosphere here. The food was delicious and  plenty of it! We definitely plan to return soon."}
{"text":"We love this place for some go-to weekday sushi. It's not quite a high-end, trendsetting place. And quite often it's really quiet in there with only a few other customers, but they do a lot of takeout. Their sushi is fresh, with some really tasty rolls. Service is down to earth and helpful. Plus, the 20% off most dinner items seems to be a semi-permanent feature of the place! Yay!"}
{"text":"Have been sitting here for almost 1 hour waiting for our food. Short staffed. Poor management. No one here cares about customer service. No wonder they offer discounts on their food.   Good waitresses  - work their butt off. We won't be visiting his place again. Much better options in the area."}
{"text":"A+ Presentation & freshest sushi I've had in Charlotte. More fish than rice in the rolls which justifies a slight increase in price..."}
{"text":"3.5 for food 2.5 for drink  we usually order their curry chicken/beef: love their curry sauce, not too creamy, oily and salty.  I like this HK style curry; for sure this is not Japanese or Thai curry.  There are a lot of meat and cooked perfectly.   Pork chop sandwich, if you don't want rice or noodle.  It's a good choice too.   Even it is a Cha Chang Tang, we don't feel rush to finish our food."}
{"text":"really good japanses food?sushi are really fresh?we like to eat here."}
{"text":"I don't know what to make of this place.    First time we went there, owner lady recommended we try their curry and roti - which is apparently their specialty.  Tried the curry beef brisket and roti next time we went and it was great.  Curry not too spicy and roti size very good portion.  Went again a week later - sorry, the flour is not ready for the pancake.  Fine, I just had plain rice.  Went again the following week for another try on a Friday when beef brisket rice is on the lunch menu as a Friday special - sorry, the beef brisket sold out the other day and the new brisket is not yet soft.  Um, ok, don't the chef look ahead to what is on special the next day?  I made a comment to the waitress who replied in a dismissive tone \"life is not perfect\", wtf?  What kind of attitude is that?  Went again today to try again with the curry beef brisket and roti - sorry, not available.    I give up.  We tried some other dishes, they were only \"so so\".  Not sure I am going to bother going there again.  Service is also very very slow."}
{"text":"Perfect day for lunch at Tin Tin - Buy 1, Get 1 Free Sushi Menu. I ordered the Florida Roll w/ salmon and the Mary Roll. Both were delicious, but the Florida Roll is my fav!  My experience walking in the door, I was not greeted nor acknowledged as a new customer until I stopped a waiter and asked if it was self seating. She only replied that it was a 15-20 min wait, but the restaurant was half empty (of course I was confused). I seated myself and waited 10 minutes before stopping another waiter and asking her to take my order. Customer service needs to be better, but the food was great."}
{"text":"I come to Tin Tin Cafe about 1-3 times a week for either their Hibachi, sushi or BOTH! I am so picky about my Hibachi and this place has NEVER disappointed! I don't like Toyamas, Ishi, Ichi, Kabuto's Hibachi especially compared to Tin Tin. It's AMAZING. their tin tin roll is one of my favorite sushi. I've recommended 7-15 friends here and they all LOVE it sooooooo much to where they even recommend their friends! They give you so much food. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I work across the street so it's nice to see a good restaurant within walking distance. I've been here a few times now. The pricing is fantastic given the portions you receive. The food tastes pretty good. They also seem to run out of the Friday lunch special, curry beef brisket quite frequently. I've yet to try it but I hear it is very good! Service could be better, many times my food order always seems to arrive much longer after my colleagues have received their food. I would come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"I hope business picks up or this might go the way of its predecessors in this strip. We were the only table for Thursday lunch. Service was great food was really amazing. Especially for the price! Currently they are offering 30% off of all lunch items and sushi. We gorged ourselves on sushi rolls as well as hibachi lunch entr√©es.  All were good."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The atmosphere is nice, clean and relaxing. The service is always great and quick. And the sushi is AMAZING. I can't believe how good the sushi is. We always have to get the crunchy rice roll because it's phenomenal. It's always consistently delicious. The prices are so low and it's always astounding how little we pay. This is the best sushi spot in charlotte. Everyone must give it a try!"}
{"text":"Do they deserve 4 stars, no, but I still feel bad with 3.  3.5 seems right.  Its your nothing special cheap Japanse Habachi kind of spot.  A dime a dozen.  They weren't very busy, but its an interesting location and I was a little later than the average lunch time.  FYI, there is another similar spot .5 mile away.  But this place has much nicer decor.  They tried and the food wasn't bad.  It wasn't super awesome that the lady behind the register was talking on a cell phone and not really paying me attention when I tried to order, but hey, I was on hold on a cell phone as well.  I guess its just the way we live these days.  The Hibachi combo for less than $5 gets 4-5 stars for value.  That's the only reason I gave them a chance instead of Bojangles though.  Rice, a veggie and a spring roll.  A great deal.  The chicken was kind of pale and didnt' have a good sear to it, but still tasted fine and had decent texture.  It is what it is.  Would I go hear if looking for a nice meal.....  Probably not.  Would I give it another shot relying on value....  Will do."}
{"text":"It's not terrible. Sushi menu is definitely limited. Did not try the hibachi only the sushi which was just ok. Not bad and not good. Probably wouldn't go back voluntarily. Some of their food is out of the box frozen like the crab Rangoon instead of made to order. I asked the waitress and she told me it was frozen.  The ginger salad was terrible because the ginger sauce was bad. Salad lettuce was browning. If you have options, I say pass."}
{"text":"I very rarely give harsh negative reviews how ever this place needs to address their customer service skills.  I was not acknowledged when walked in they ignored me, no it was not busy at all maybe 2 tables were sat. After finally being seated (5 mins later) I waited another 10 mins before walking out due to no one coming to get my order.   I've seen good reviews on the food but can't tell you how it is. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Didn't even know there was a cafe here! Came here for lunch with my family, and was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience.   Nice decor with quite a few windows, giving the space a nice bit of natural lighting and a modern vibe. The lunch menu was quite small, and only 1 page was applicable to the time. They also have a daily special section, but not a dish I liked.   I ended up choosing the Curry Chicken with Rice, and it came with soup and a drink. The curry was okay, but not spicy at all. A little disappointing in that regard, but still had a nice taste to it. Would have enjoyed it a little more if it had more of a kick to it. They did have a good Hong Kong Style Milk Tea though!  Overall a pretty good little cafe for a lunch once in a while. Always nice to find a new cafe to change it up from the usual spots I usually end up going to. Will definitely be back again, but may be a little more selective in my choice next time."}
{"text":"Tin tin has good food at great prices. It's rare to find a BOGO roll place in charlotte so we were very pleased to find this one. Service is a little slow but no problem."}
{"text":"Its just okay, best for lunch specials.  The service is slow and the sushi rice is too much for each roll"}
{"text":"Having me some good sushi. My bf and I really love this place. Reasonable price for a good amount of food"}
{"text":"Best hibachi I have had in Charlotte and so affordable. We also had the crab roll and the tempura shrimp and both were very good. I love the fact that you get to choose the veggies you put in your hibachi"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a lunch date for the second time.  Here are my thoughts....  The good... Great prices, courteous service, clean, good food....nice little restaurant.  The bad... Service is really slow, it took 10 minutes to get seated, once seated the service is still slow.  Sushi orders take nearly 30 mins.  We've heard several customers request their food be packaged \"to go\" because they've run out of time.  Summary.... nice spot, just make sure you're not pressed for time."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place last night because I wanted some sushi and didn't want to venture far from home.  There were very few other tables taken, but sounds like they do pretty good carry out business.  I ordered two rolls (spicy shrimp and crazy hot roll) and my husband was excited to see Cantonese Style Chow Fun on the menu.  The food came out so fast, I was sure it wouldn't be fresh or good.  Boy was I wrong.  The sushi and the noodle dish were both delicious!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi restaurant. The crunchy shrimp roll and sesame chicken are incredible!"}
{"text":"I arrived at 6:35pm eastern standard time we received our drinks it is now 7:34pm eastern standard time. We have not yet received our food. The manager \"WILL\" keeps avoiding our table. This is a very bad establishment to come to. The customer service is very bad and it's also very unpleasant and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The place is nice and comfortable to seat in. Food is very average and service is good and quick."}
{"text":"I  ate at this place before and the food was good! Customer service...was good. Today (02 May 17) the customer service was bad. My wife, my 2yr old, and I walked in at lunch. My wife asked a lady we assumed worked there, as she was walking by us, if we should sit ourselves. Now grant it, she walked up to three or four guys ordering at the bar/checking out....as she walked past us standing there. The lady's response was ,\"just wait a minute.\" My wife asked again and the lady gave the same response. I asked my wife loud enough for everyone to hear if she wanted to eat her. She said no and we left. We went to Persis Biryani Indian Restaurant instead which was on the other side of the parking lot. When I got there I called Tin Tin and asked to speak to a manager. I was told they didn't have one. Persis staff was very polite. When we walked in they said ,\"welcome.\" They were polite during our $34 lunch. Hey, I spent more because they were polite. Tin Tin, your food is good but work on your staff's courtesy. That lady could have said, I'll be with you in one moment ma'am instead of saying, just wait a minute. I guess this happens when people get comfortable."}
{"text":"Air conditioner broken, no note on the door. Food was really good, but I had to sweat as I ate my food. Talked to server, cashier, and manager about what they would do to get me in the door again...a free sweet tea! If you are going make sure it's comfortable in there as they really hurt my thoughts of tin tin. Thanks manager for nothing, enjoy our money it won't happen again."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Tea is so so.  Not much reason to come back. Opening day service is extremely slow.  I would wait until things settle down to come back."}
{"text":"This was a nice choice and we will go back. The service was excellent! I loved how clean the place was and I liked the decor, too. Our server recommended the Florida roll with salmon instead of tuna and it was delicious. I strongly recommend that. We had seafood noodle soup bowls as our main entrees. We thought the ramen and udon noodles were cooked perfectly. The only reason I can't give Tin Tin Caf√© a 5/5 is that we had imitation crab in our soups. Give it a try! I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"It was an average Sunday evening when the overwhelming desire for sushi came over me and a friend. My buddy suggested this place, having already been here a couple of times. To start, the place was absolutely empty at 8:30, so finding a seat was super easy. We were greeted and sat at one of the many booths in this place. Seriously, there's a lot of booths! Throughout the restaurant, you'll see a ton of colorful decor, making this place stand out from most sushi spots.   Once sat, the waitress took our order and that's when the excitement began! Despite a few hiccups in service from our server, the sushi rolls hit our table on a lovely white serving dish. After we cleared that dish, we added another couple of rolls to the mix. You know, just to confirm that the rolls were as good as we thought - for the accuracy of this review. No major complaints about the food, as all of the rolls we had were good to great!   One of the biggest negatives that I found with this place was their \"30% off\" offering... Why?! The food is plenty good to not tarnish the brand with silly discount signage in the front windows. The service could have been better, as we had to ask for some items on more than one instance. All in all, a good experience that I'd definitely return for."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I expected this to be more of a takeout place, but it is definitely more of an eat-in experience. We ordered  a Hibachi chicken meal, and some sushi rolls (Alaska and Tuna) The hibachi came with a salad, soup and choice of several sides. The salads came out, and almost immediately the soup and our main courses were brought to the table. The timing could use some improvement. The sushi was very good and the texture was better than most local places. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi at a good price then you definitely want to eat at Tin Tin Cafe off of Mallard Creek in Charlotte. The sushi is not only pleasing to the eye, but your pallet will also be satisfied. Bring a flashlight when you go because I think that they are trying to save money on the electric bill. The lighting is low and the restaurant is a bit dark. The lights are low to keep you from looking at your date if he or she is ugly. Anyway, the great food will make you come back. Nd, they have buy one get one free specials. Check out the pic."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday.  When we walked in we were the only customers. By the time we left there was only one other person dining.  I ordered the ramen bowl with tofu, my friend got raw fish and rice plate. I'd say the only thing nice about the food was the portion. The fish didn't look fresh, but i didn't try it.  My tofu was the soft kind not cooked enough - it basically fell apart whenever I tried to pick it up. The noodles were udon, not ramen. The veggies were cut haphazardly (appearances do matter).  Flavor was okay, but definitely not good. I won't go back."}
{"text":"We were hoping for a reliable place to have sushi/sashimi, but was sadly disappointed. We ordered the love boat for 2 and the fish was a bit frozen in the middle. We mentioned this to the waitress and she brought out the \"chef\" who explained to us (as if this was our first time having sushi/sashimi) that that is how the fish should be eaten and it would defrost in a few minutes. Really?"}
{"text":"It is really 3.5 stars because  1) the food was fresh 2) it tasted decent.   3) the lunch combo, all priced at $7.99, was well portioned,  4) AND a free Chinese newspaper was included.    There is an OK selection on the lunch menu as well.  There seems to be some excellent lunch deals on weekdays at $5.99."}
{"text":"I have been to tin tin a few times. Each time I have dined in the service was extremely slow. And the latest time I went at 9:30 and they said the kitchen was closed and it was carry out only. Even though the website says 10 pm. Extremely rude to us. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Best choice for Chinese in Charlotte! I had standard fare, sesame chicken, and my girlfriend had shrimp tempura with iron noodle soup.we both loved our dishes and wonder why we haven't visited before."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE if you have limited time for a meal - I just walked out after sitting there for 15 minutes looking at the menu. The first time I visited, the food was good, but the wait was unusually long for the place not being crowded at all (maybe 5 people, including myself). I decided to ignore it and assume that every restaurant has a slow day, but this second time was unacceptable. If you work in the area, and have limited time for lunch, save yourself the time and don't bother."}
{"text":"The hibachi meals are really nice. The sushi is good too. The potions are nice. Overall it's a nice place in the university area."}
{"text":"We found this place a couple months ago, and now call ourselves regulars!  The food is awesome and the service is top notch !!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Small in size and large in quality. The sushi menu is impressive and they currently have 30% off all sushi! This was definitely one of the driving forces behind my visit. The staff is friendly and attentive. I look forward to returning with friends!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff and a nice environment but I did have some issue with the food. Their sushi rolls and Shuman were good but I got the ikura nigiri and it was by far the worst I've ever had. It was honestly hard to eat. Really hindered my experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service!!  Just awful!  They weren't that busy but it took 5 minutes just to be sat. Once sat we had to ask for drinks.  And we never did order dinner because after about 15 minutes and the manager telling us \"I'll be right back to get your order\" we left.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Sure the 3.99 chicken special sounds good except the portions are so small that I can eat the whole thing in 3 bites.Id rather pay more and get a bigger portion so I dont wind up still hungry after I eat it, and im a skinny guy."}
{"text":"4.5/5   Definitely keeps up the good food. I came here for the second time and I was not disappointed. Food is delicious (especially their curry), owner is surprising well dressed, polite and very formal. Workers are patient and don't rush your decisions when ordering   Food takes less than 5 minutes to get to your table even when it's a full house! (Very amused)   I ordered the pork chop with an rice in an omelette and its hands down the best thing I've had in a while. Pork is tender and juicy and the rice is cooked just right. Upgrading ur meal for a dollar is worth ever penny. For all dollar, you get a drink and a soup. (Never ever heard of such a good deal!)   I would recommend others to come to this resturant to try out their food. Additionally I will come again for more curry ;)  WIFI PASSWORD:  Tin tin 2: their phone number"}
{"text":"Came in at 3 and it was dead but to be expected. Had my spicy tuna roll which is the way I judge sushi places to see if I'd like to try anything else. Was a good tasting roll will update when I try some more menu options"}
{"text":"I stopped by with a few friends who invited me to go out to eat with them. I've never actually gone out exclusively for sushi before, so my opinion might not mean as much as somebody's whose has tried a lot of different sushi places. The restaurant itself is nice on the inside. It has a bunch of cool LED lights on the walls and the ceiling. I ordered the tempura California roll and the spicy tuna roll. The wait was a little long (30 minutes or so) considering we were one of two or three other tables seated at the restaurant, and the dishes came out one-by-one instead of all at once, but the sushi itself was good. The two rolls were buy one get the cheaper one free. It cost about $9 and change in total, and it was just enough food. I'll be back to try other kinds of sushi."}
{"text":"Really good fast service.  The tempura California roll proved to be the most popular choice for our party of 11 but I didn't care for it. The shrimp sauce is really good.  The server was very accommodating in supplying us with multiple checks. Room is nicely decorated and they have 2 televisions.  I would come here again for the lunch special. They did a very good job with my carrots."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. Food was good, service fast and accommodating. We had tempura shrimp and vegetables, crab wontons, and sushi."}
{"text":"This is my second or third meal from Tin Tin. Today they are running an excellent special on the hibachi chicken for $2.95. It includes one veggie and two sides, a definite steal for the money! I would say overall, the service is moderate but the food is above satisfactory for takeout Japane"}
{"text":"Visited here today with a recommendation  of a friend.  It was close to where I live, the place is in a small plaza, not a noticable place.  We lined up for about 5 minutes, it's a small place but decorated nicely. It is however a little tight in the seating if you're sitting against the wall.  They have set lunches with different offerings every day of the week.  The soup was fairly good, the usual vegetable soup.  The dishes are served at a fair size, lunch is about standard $7.99 for soup and the entree.  Their drinks are definately not my liking, the tea base is just too watery and barely has tea taste.    We were also asked to move to another table near the end of our meal because they needed to take our table to seat a table of 6, wasn't too happy about that either.    Probably won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Tried hibachi.. Expensive dinner.. Food quantity and quality is ok. May be I would try 1's in a month"}
{"text":"Overall- I would give this place somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars. Here is the run down:  We went on a Friday night. Decent crowd but no wait and not all tables were full. A friendly gentleman (I assume the owner or manager) seated us right away. He came back to the table a minute later and we ordered drinks and the crab rangoon. He came back five minutes later and took our sushi order. 20 more minutes passed and we wondered where the crab rangoons were. When the gentleman approached, he had our sushi. As he set it down, we let him know the crab rangoons never came. He told us he would check on it and that they only take \"two minutes\" to come out. Less than five minutes later, they were brought out. I'm pretty sure they weren't put in until we reminded him.   As for the food taste and quality- I'd definitely say skip the rangoons. We didn't even finish them because their was NO crab in it. None. Tons of cream cheese but no crab. We did, however, like the sushi. My fianc√© ordered the Smokey Salmon Roll and the NC Roll. I ordered the Sunrise Roll and Rising Sun Roll (I think that's what they are called). Next time I would skip the carrot that was in one of them but they were pretty good - especially considering the buy one, get one free deal.   Side note: the specials posted in the windows on project board paper doesn't look great. Makes it seem run down when the inside isn't that bad.   Overall, I would say it's a decent spot for sushi but not the best place around."}
{"text":"Tin Tin Cafe opens two weeks or so ago in the space used to be Joe Yee Vegetarian. Tin Tin, a Hong Kong Style cafe serving HK style Western food, Asian Fusion (ramen, curry) and other comfort food.  The interior have been totally redecorated. Gone were the large round tables to be replaced with small tables and booths. Gone were the Buddhist chants to be replaced by HDTV showing World Cup matches or Chinese Shows.  They still working on their afternoon tea menu but the price here is reasonable even without lunch special. $7.99 or so would get you a set meal with choice of soup and drink.  Curry Beef Brisket with Rice ($6.99) comes with Borscht soup and HK milk tea. Portion is generous and food is delicious.  Milk tea was smooth. Definitely not bad at this price point.  Free Sing Tao Newspaper and 10% grand opening special."}
{"text":"I came here with my mother while looking for a place to grab some lunch in the middle of our busy grocery shopping day. I hadn't been feeling so well and had a rather sore throat. Despite being rather hungry, all I really wanted was some soup. My mother, of whom actually eats breakfast was hungry, but not famished.   We stumbled into Tin Tin. My mother had been here before with my sister and knew what to expect, but this was my first time. We were quickly seated, and began perusing through the menu. I had trouble deciding what I wanted, due to too many things looking good, but also my desire for soup. Did I want to order a meal with miso on the side? Did I want my meal to be soup? Mom was having trouble deciding on what she would want to have as leftovers, knowing she wouldn't eat much.   The owner came and took our drink orders. Mom ordered water, and I ordered hot tea. I let mine steep for a little bit, and then when the owner came back, I asked if I could have ice water as well. He poured my tea for me, and then brought the water. Mom asked him about a sign in one of the windows, talking about a shrimp dish for $6.99. After hearing that she had her choice of vegetables, she decided on that with mushrooms. I ordered the seafood udon soup.   Mom's shrimp and mushroom dish came out first. She must've had hers for at least five minutes before mine came out piping hot. The shrimp and scallops were delicious. The broccoli was cooked perfectly, to the point that it was still crisp on the soup, and the udon noodles had the perfect texture. Our food was great, and every time the owner came by, he poured more tea for me.   When we asked for boxes for our food, he brought them out rather quickly. We then took turns using the bathroom, and I was blown away by the decor. The restaurant itself was beautiful, with gold accented sumies. The ceiling had glittery lights, but since it was daytime, I didn't get the full experience. In the bathroom, it was dark with a glittery and glowing ceiling. The faucet on the sink was designed to look like bamboo, and the entire place just seemed magical. I honestly never thought I'd describe a bathroom that way.   We got our checks, and left rather generous tips. If I am ever in the area again, I would love to go back and try all of the different things that I was debating on while reading the menu."}
{"text":"Loved this gem!   Great service, great ambiance, great price, and amazing sushi. Everything tasted so fresh! I've been needing a good, consistent sushi place in the area and I think I've found it."}
{"text":"Sushi is great!  Hibachi is great and plenty.  Menu is extensive enough for me. Flavors of each meals are unique and consistent. Decor is pretty. Plating is artistic. Service is good. Take out is good, quick and accurate. Close to my home. I needed something like this near me. What's there not to like?"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I tried this place shortly after opening for lunch. None of the lunch specials appealed to any of us. The lunch specials also seemed expensive, closer to $10 or more. In my mind if you are offering a lunch special it should be $6-$8 (I know $2 isn't going to make or break that many of us, but it's the principle!).   Two of us got a sushi roll and a side salad. My other friend got a larger sushi platter. The food was all right, but the rolls seemed to be on the smaller side. My friend who got the sushi platter was disappointed with the fish as well. Honestly when the bill came, it seemed really expensive for what we got. I feel like they were trying to be a fancy sushi restaurant but offering low-budget quality food   The restaurant opened in a space of the strip mall that has been vacant for YEARS. I was excited to see something go in there finally. They did a really good job with the decor and you can tell they thought about trying to create a cool atmosphere. However, my guess is that this place will not last that long if they don't try to capture more of a lunch crowd and offer some better deals."}
{"text":"I love this place! I discovered this little gem while getting jimmy johns when I first moved to the area in July, and my boyfriend and I have frequented it ever since! The sushi is the best I've had in awhile - super fresh tasting! The hibachi entrees are reasonably priced for the amount of food you get with them - we always have leftovers. The service is ok - seems like they only have 1 waitress and they tend to be very slow and not very attentive. Overall, the staff is very nice though. Only thing I'd change is the lack of music in the restaurant - most of the time when we dine in we're the only one there, and without music or tv noise the place is almost awkwardly silent lol"}
{"text":"The food was good and the customer service was genuine. It's more expensive than Toyamas right up the road, but I wouldn't coming to splurge on their food. Also, if you go in the evening it's nicely lit with intimate lighting from the water art in the front, to the glass bottles that change at the top of the bar."}
