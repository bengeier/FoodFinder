{"text":"We have been regular diners at Rukos since around the time they opened. Always great service, great food and good prices. We have also recommended them to many people, however they have been leaving us wanting, wanting you ask, wanting what!? FOOD is what! Just this last Saturday we walked out without a meal again having done this twice before! We walked in and immediately you see the dry erase white board with the daily specials, after looking it over we already know what we want as we had a craving for it which is why we decided to give Rukos their THIRD chance to redeem themselves! We sat down waitress took our drink orders and when she came back with our drinks I said we already knew what we wanted and we had discussed if they didn't have what we wanted we had a secondary item also ready. We both wanted thier prime rib special, sure enough she said just a minute went to the kitchen came back said they were out of prime rib. Disappointed we said OK we will have a steak, once again she said sorry no steaks either, so we said thank you got up left our drinks totally untouched and walked out that was their third strike and we are done with them! This was actually the same thing that has happened exactly the same one other time and the time before that the prime rib they brought to the table my husbands was good, however my piece was small, wrinkled and dry as a bone so I sent it back and the waitress came back said sorry we have no more prime rib would you like something else? No but I didn't have a choice did I!? So I ordered a steak, sorry no steak what else can i get you? NOTHING  but thanks, so I drank my pop while I let my husband eat. He of course wanted to get up and walk out and I told him no, enjoy the food, we will get me something later if I even had an appetite after the aggrevation. I asked him if his prime rib was at least good because I didn't want to force him to sit there eating a garbage piece of prime rib or we both could have just walked out. But his was good and cooked the way he likes so I was happy to sit there while one of us ate a meal and enjoyed it. I drank my coke watched a bit of tv and talked with him also, it didnt bother me that he was eating and i was not, he deserved a meal he enjoyed after working all week. He kept saying I feel guilty, I joked with him dont worry about it, I would make him pay later! lol I actually thought they might give us a bit of a discount for our time and trouble as the owner was there and I got not even a carrot stick to eat, but nope no discount and was told \" we aren't charging you for your meal only charging for the one meal and 2 pops.\" WHAT meal? The one I took ONE bite of and sent to kitchen for the garbage bin!? We would have been arrested for sure walking out without paying that $15.00 for a meal I didnt eat and saw in front of me for 3 minutes before sending it back! lol Honestly as a previous restaurant owner something like that happened at our restaurant, the meal would have been free that night, and a gift certificate for thier next visit would have been given to my customer for the trouble it caused my customers that day and to make up for MY STUPIDITY for not having enough stock of (alternate choices in case specials ran out) going into a weekend service!  Not the way RUKOS runs thier business obviously, losing at least 2 customers for sure now and how many more we have recommended and will tell and how many this yelp review will see and think twice about dining there. Just by not doing everything in thier power to apologize and make \"us\" thier customers feel like we were IMPORTANT to them is a reason not to dine there for us at this point in time!! So now Rukos has been out of prime rib AND all three steaks on thier menu THREE different times we have gone, and we understand specials can and will run out HOWEVER If you have a dry erase board in front when people walk in and you are out of something ERASE it and wait staff should always tell you the specials OR apologise and let you know before you even order they are out of something! So we actually gave Rukos THREE chances (for just the prime rib special, we still went back for breakfast a time or two before we finally said NEVER again for any meal) thinking it may be a fluke (actually mentioning it at another one of our visits and the waitress laughed it off saying oh yes the one time it seemed everyone ordered it that Saturday and we ran out, I in turn said well it was Friday so you were out two days?! Thats not good for business!) but she just laughed it off, we heard her mention it to the owner who was in the kitchen when she placed our order and who could have at least come out to apologize to two of his customers who came to his restaurant regularly (at least once a week) and even though we do like their food we have decided to take Rukos OFF our restaurant list of places to eat, after all its hit or miss if I eat anyway!!"}
{"text":"Ruko's is a typical family owned/operated family restaurant.  Very, very friendly staff.  Always clean and accommodating.  I've been there a few times and I've always left satisfied."}
{"text":"the food was average at best, but i'm always happy to support locally-owned businesses so i wouldn't be against coming back."}
