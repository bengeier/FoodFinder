{"text":"I Live Right on Parc Avenue, just beside parc metro. I called in for their service after I was pleased with their food and delivery the first time. But this time, they were just rude. Told me that they do not and will not deliver that far. I even told them that I will try and tip the driver a hefty amount, but they just hanged up on me.   This is how they start treating their customers when they have the amount they need. Great business mentality you have going on there. I wish you well, but I will not be calling for their service anytime soon."}
{"text":"Poutine was amazing. There was only one employee but he was very friendly and helpful. There was a long wait time but we were given free cookies as an apology. Great food, service and environment."}
{"text":"Chef on Call is the best delivery food in Montreal hands down. They deliver until 4am on weekends, their staff is really friendly, and the food always tastes fresh and of quality. The sweet potato fries are amazing, and all of the dipping sauces are so good. Try the chicken tenders, any of the wraps, or even the light dishes like the Chic salad are a good choice. If you don't want pizza, Chef on call is the best option!"}
{"text":"we were walking around the neighborhood,  and found this place, it's a bit hard to find since it's in the basement so you have to walk down the stairs and the entrance is a bit concealed...  It's a small cozy place, nothing fancy, but the menu is quite extensive and they open late. They close at 3 or 4 am or something like that.  The staff in young and friendly, very homey service. They have these old joke plaques on the wall it's kitschy and cute.  we ordered pasta and a wrap. The portions are fine, however it is a bit pricey for regular take-out food. They wings and pasta, wraps and burgers, poutine, the list goes on... they have a lot of things you would want at 2 am that give comfort in the winter. The place seems geared toward college students since it's so close to McGill ghetto.  For dessert I had pot de creme, it was very nice :)  definitely on my list for lazy food comfort"}
{"text":"A gem of a delivery service.  If you want good quality 'junk food' (burgers, poutine, sandwiches, high calorie pasta) these folks know what's up.  Seriously good burgers especially. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"That was some damn good Banana milkshake. Ordered twice in two days and still craving more. Have not tried anything else but would visit/order again just for the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Onion rings with the Chef on Call sauce is such a good side. Also, I love that they offer bomb vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The concierge at the Holiday Inn down the street pointed us to this place, which was perfect for two tired and hungry travelers looking for a quick bite to eat. We split the sweet potato poutine and each got a wrap. So delicious! If I lived in Montreal, I would eat here ALL the time. Speedy service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there for Sunday dinner , friendly service, had the Chicken Burger and Philly Wrap and some chicken tinder (nuggets) . Tables weren't clean so after few minutes decided to have to go instead of sitting there ( lights and music were total crap as well as TV was turned off ) .The whole food was extremely salty and over cooked. Add to that it's really pricey for quality of food. I wouldn't recommend this place. You are better off picking a chicken Sandwich from Tim Horton than dinning over here."}
{"text":"I love that this is a start up by by some youngsters. The concept really works given how in just a little over a year that went from one delivery car to 3. They are doing something right.  For a dyed in the wool Montrealer - foodie - this is not all that gourmet, though still good eatz.  I am glad that they keep their menu limited and do what they do right; instead of doing everything just passably."}
{"text":"Late night delivery.  That is what makes me order from this place once and a while.  The food is ok, it is a hit or miss. Sometimes the burger and fries come perfectly arranged and well cooked.  Sometimes the fries are soggy and the burger has burned buns and way too much mayo. They have vegetarian options.  It is pretty cheap. They close their Sherbrooke st location, but they still deliver to that area."}
{"text":"Just visiting Montréal but I wish I lived here after that meal! They said 45 minute delivery but got here way faster than that, and everything I ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"I waited 2 hours for my meal to be delivered to be said by someone who didn't gave a fuck about the situation that my meal is never gonna be delivered! WTF? Fortunately I called because I had waited forever for my food!...and sorry guys but we're in Montréal here so you should have bilingual employees. Even if I'm French-Canadian I wrote this review in English! Nobody's speak my mother tongue there."}
{"text":"Super pour un hangover ! Le confort Food idéal sauf quand ton burger est froid ... Heureusement que les curly fries sont vraiment bonne avec sa petite mayonnaise à l'ail une merveille . Délai de take ouf 10 min"}
{"text":"Chef on Call is Da Real MVP. Awesome food, Best : Chicken tenders, Oh So Crispy, Buffalo wrap. Definitely would Recommend the Big Willy From Philly as well. Be sure to add a Oreo or Reese's Pieces Milkshake and a Cookie. But if you're really feeling dirty, try the Deep Fried Mars Bar.  I should explain the 4/5 instead of the 5/5. Removed 1 star because 1 time out of 5 their delivery is below par. To sum things up. If you're drunk, Chef on Call, If you're hungry, Chef On Call, If you have exams and need comfort food, You guessed it. Chef On Call."}
{"text":"Beef was the star of the show, we ordered mushroom melt, cheeseburger and chicken burger ( my favorites) but the boys went cookoo for the burgers. They were juicy and tasty as fuck"}
{"text":"You know you eat from a place too often when even the delivery man recognizes you! I've never physically eaten at Chef on Call, but I definitely call on them when I'm too lazy to cook for myself and want to indulge. They're friendly, convenient, and have plenty to offer! I've tried nearly everything on the menu and usually alternate between these.  My personal recommendations -   Chic salad. Burgers: Spicy Big Crunch, Oh So Crispy, and The Gourmet. Chicken tenders. Milkshakes: Oreo, Chocolate, Vanilla. Wraps: Chicken Caesar, Buffalo, Chicago Club, California.  Enjoy, friends!!"}
{"text":"We hired Chef on Call to cater for our yearly Research Day conference. We had always delt with building services for catering before, so we were a bit stressed about how ordering from outside would go. We contacted them well ahead of time (this summer) to get an idea of the menu and pricing, and one of our coordinators went to sample the food. She returned more than satisfied and full! After comparing prices with two other catering services, we decided to go for Chef.  On the day of the conference, Chef on Call arrived ahead of time and discretly set up the tables and plated the food. When the morning conference presentations ended, we all headed over to the lunch area - which was a sight to behold!! The tables had been covered with tablecloths and large platters of wraps, sandwiches, veggies, fruits, treats, bakeries and more. There was also plenty of ustensils, plates and napkins. According to our post-conference surveys, the lunch was actually a highlight of the day for most people!  I think there was more than enough food for everybody, but even then, our guests finished all sandwiches. Fruits also flew away from the plates. There was quite a bit of veggies and salads  leftover, much to the delight of our money- and vitamin-deprived graduate students (they brought them home after the event).  We were very happy!"}
{"text":"I haven't gotten delivery from this place yet, but dining in was a very fun experience.  I like the layout of the store, I think the staff was really nice. They also have this base walk-in menu where everything is 10$! and it comes with a drink. That's pretty great in my opinion.   I ordered the poutine with bacon and an oreo milkshake. The poutine was good, I've had better, but it was well made. The milkshake is the definite winner. It was so good, it's nothing like those places that say it's a milkshake but really it's just ice cream in a cup with a straw.   The oreo milkshake was so smooth and pleasant and refreshing. It even had little bits of oreo to add some crunch."}
{"text":"The chef is a life saver, seriously! The hotel I was staying at cut room service at 11p and I had just come in after a 13 mile run...I was STARVING. They told me to call the chef and I'm glad I did.  The chef served goodness in tn these various forms...  - Poutine: It was my  first time to have it in Montreal and the chef did it up right. I was sure to add the chicken and bacon because that's how I roll :)  - Chic Salad: Can't resist anything with goat's cheese. Very well prepared and yummy to boot.   - Oreo Shake: Oh YES I did. It was amaaazing and I could have had like 10 more.   Call the chef, he'll sort you out for sure. Good food and fast delivery...in fact this is some of the best delivery food I've had."}
{"text":"Sigh. I used to love Chef on Call, but sadly the quality and service has just gone way downhill. Delivery times used to be reasonable; now they are excruciatingly slow. Food, as well, used to be some of the best in the city for delivery. Now, not so much. Not sure what happened..."}
{"text":"These burgers, fries, and shakes are no joke. Plus they have buffalo sauce to dip your fries in. I ordered the same meal from them 3 nights in a row. They were a total life saver in bad weather. The deliveries are quick and the food is still hot when you get it even in a snow storm. It's amazing that they deliver so late so don't hesitate to call on them if you're starving late at night."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Chef On Call for a while, probably ordered around 15-20 times in the past 3 months... But everytime the delivery guy is at the door, he \"has no change\" and I'm forced leaving him with an extra tons of money because I have no smaller bills or change...  I mean, in a restaurant if a customer would come and ask for change and I'd tell him \"Sorry, i don't have any\" how unprofessional would that be? I just ordered and I was forced to leave a 20$ bill on a 15$ order. My boyfriend was once forced to leave 9$ behind because of that. They ask for our payment method when checking out why not be ready for that? It's not even about how much we leave behind, but that makes me wanna give 0 tips anymore.  Really unprofessional."}
{"text":"Once had really good chicken tenders here but when I came back they were very dry.   Their garlic sauce is good though."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this delivery service! It was so awesome to have delivery so late (We don't have restaurants that deliver past 9:30 where I live) I ordered a hotdog (the bun was delicious!) and of course, I had to-- could not resist-- a deep fried mars bars which was HEAVENTLY. It was also great that they were able to help me out in english, because I tried to order from so many other places that just did not work out because I could not speak french.   From my understanding this is ran by a bunch of college students, which made me more inclined to tip even better.  If you're in Montreal on a trip like I was and just want to sit, relax, and order in after a long day- I would definitely recommend ordering from here! don't forget the deep fried mars bars."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place as the reviews and options seemed promising, however; our order was cancelled after two hours of waiting. Tonight was apparently a busy night and since we ordered through Just Eats our order was cancelled and we received no phone call to speak to us and/or let us know we werent getting our food. So we called after an hour and a half and they told us it would be another half hour. We waited and waited and eventually called again. Someone made a mistake and we were offered a refund and to speak to the manager. The manager offered to fulfill our order when he was under the impression that we ordered directly through the site, but when he understood we ordered through just eat his offer was revoked and we were quite confused, hungry, and upset."}
{"text":"Their crispy chicken with jalopeno and bacon is one of the best. They also deliver till late at night so if you are hungry at 2am you can order from there without any problem.  Their original fries and chef on call sauce are just amazing and super tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered beef and chicken burger with curly fries. Burgers were tasteless and completely burned, and the fries was dry like stone."}
{"text":"Women said there was a chicken shortage, but chicken comes with a set of drumstick and wings.  Felt like we got shoved off, manager did not want to deal with a simple issue."}
{"text":"Les hamburgers mangés ici étaient délicieux, ainsi que les frites aux pommes de terre douces avec une sauce. Poutine aussi disponible.  Fréquenté principalement par de jeunes clients étudiants.  Le propriétaire ou autre (homme dans la cinquantaine) a été très gentil et nous a apporté de l'eau à la table malgré que ce ne soit pas un restaurant avec service. Vous commandez directement au comptoir et vous assoyez pour manger."}
{"text":"Good late night food delivery. Try their fettucini alfredo or avacado sandwiches or really bomb milkshakes. Bit pricey compared to other late night deliveries but worth it. Option to order online is nice for ppl who hate speaking on the phone."}
{"text":"Just opened on Park and it's definitely an upgrade from their old spot on Sherbrooke! Their veggie burger hits the spot when you're crazing one and their fries are perfection fresh and hot out of the flyer. Love the new interior and am always glad for delivery when it's too cold outside. Their online delivery page is wonderful.   Try their Oreo Milkshake if you really want to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Much prefer the Chef on Call on Bishop Street. I have eaten there for years but they are currently closed for the summer for renovations, since they have closed I have been to the Parc location 4 times, all 4 times my order has been wrong. And the staff decided to argue with me about it and then correct their mistake in quite the rude manner. Steer clear of the Parc location, they obviously require new kitchen staff."}
{"text":"The service, quality, and price of this student favorite make it worth the four stars. I've been to Chef on Call multiple times and have never left disappointed. Their Penne Arrabbiata is amazing and only $10 (plus tax) with the walk in special which includes a canned drink. To be fair, it isn't culinarily exotic or the most flavorful food in the world, but the consistency of great service, good food, and price make it worth a visit. If you're in Montreal as a tourist I recommend going elsewhere but for students, and residents this is a terrific place for a quick and quality meal. Note, they offer free, and in my experience rapid delivery within the downtown area."}
{"text":"Chef on Call est généralement mon choix n°1 lorsque je souhaite me faire livrer de la comfort food.   Les burgers sont vraiment bons. Mention spéciale au \"Honey Crisp Burger\" (poulet frit, oignons rouges, laitue, fromage, moutarde au miel). Et les curly fries - avec la petite sauce à l'ail - sont à tomber !  Leur site est plutôt bien fait, il suffit de quelques clics pour commander et on peut ensuite payer à la livraison (généralement rapide). Les prix sont raisonnables et ils livrent tard dans la nuit. Bref, que du positif !"}
{"text":"Okay so its 3 am, freezing cold out and you want some gourmet food but too lazy to cook on your own. Who do you Call? \"Chef-On-Call\" This place has sweet potato fries and a garlic sauce that is from out of this world! Its kinda in a pretty shady location, and do not have much big of a room for eat-in service. There's only 2 seating tables that can hold probably 4-5 people per time, max. Whatever though, this place is great for take-out and especially the nifty delivery service."}
{"text":"Reliably great burgers, chicken tenders and milkshakes. This is all one needs to know on a Friday night at 3am.   Yes, some of their dishes fall flat, but I don't understand who orders an Alfredo from these sorts of places anyway. The veggie burger is embarrassing and sort of falls apart. The wraps never come or look as advertised. Sorry vegetarians...   What they do very well are late night comfort staples: burgers, chicken, poutine and a really damn good Oreo milkshake, and they provide this fare enthusiastically and with good service. The burgers hold up well for delivery. The food is fresh, even the salads seem 'real' and not an afterthought.   I'm a fan for several years, and will continue to be."}
{"text":"Great for students in terms of hours and delivery availabilities, and a sufficient amount of selection so long as you are in the mood for hot and greasy food. Pretty standard drunk food and pretty reliable too"}
{"text":"I have known this place since they used to be on Sherbrooke. And they have got even better since they moved on du Parc street. They not only provide totally tasty burgers, sandwiches amd salads to hungry late night birds in the McGill ghetto but also their food is tasty, fresh and the service is quick. Although known for their food delivery service, they also have walk in specials for 10$ if you live nearby and these meals are a super deal for students or people on budget. I also like the ambience of their place now - modern, simple and depicting Montreal's streets on its roof!! I usually end up eating my meal there if I walk in."}
{"text":"Just amazing garbage food you know? If you are looking to cure a hangover, blaze up and watch a movie and be fat, this should be your jam."}
{"text":"Very high quality late night delivery.  The curly fries were great.  Service was fast and friendly.  Chicken sandwich was the best part of the order."}
{"text":"Boyfriend insisted to order from this place as he said it was good from 4 years back when he first tried. Giving them 1 star so it can grab some attention. As you can see from the picture, we ordered 6 chicken wings and they gave us 5 drumsticks. Might as well call it \"chicken drums stick\" and cross out \"wings\" from the menu. We called them, and all they said was it was all random selection and they claimed that chicken is on shortage (lol), there are less wings than drums. We're definitely speechless, and disappointed. They definitely ordered massive drums just because it is cheaper. It is common sense that when we order chicken wings, you expect to get half wings/drums. If it was even 2 or 3 it would've been fine. Server handled the situation badly through the phone when we call back.   The other foods tasted great, just so if you want some wings, make sure you seek elsewhere."}
{"text":"After walking past it everyday for months, I decided it was finally time to give the place that McGill students rave about a try. The location is very ideal, just off of Sherbrooke on Parc. The building is quite new with a very sleek modern wood look! They have big tvs and lots of communal seating. I went in the afternoon and it was nearly empty which was surprising considering how much talk it gets. Maybe most people do take out/delivery?   I got the Vegetarian Cubano sandwich and sweet potato fries. The portions were very generous! It was pretty much the ultimate comfort food! The sweet potato fries were amazing! Perfect crispiness and flavor! Some of the best I've had and that's saying something. But what is really fantastic about this place are the sauces. Basically just variations on a theme of mayonnaise but delicious nonetheless. The chef on call sauce was a great dipping sauce for the fries and sandwich! Mmm!   Needless to say, I ordered delivery a few days later because it was that good."}
