{"text":"Great prices, great food. BIG burritos, reliable pizza. We go all the time"}
{"text":"Most amazing place everrrr! Not only is there good amazing but they are so nice! To everyone! One time I called for delivery and they couldn't understand me so they gave me their cell number so I can txt them my address to make sure they got it right. Every time they deliver to me it's the most amazing service I've ever had thru a company!!! Also one time when I was there I was waiting for my order and a homeless guy came in and was talking to the worker or owner I'm not to sure, but he was like is there anything I can help you with or clean or anything just so I can get a meal! And the guy was so pleasant and happy to help him that he said yes just wait a minute and he seemed so friendly to that guy!!! That just made my experience so much better!!!   We need more businesses out there like this one!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy + Cheap+ Dive +Mom & Pop shop = Go, go, go!!!  For only $13.99 + tax, you can get a large 1 topping pizza and 10 wings! Since they also make Mexican food, they sell the real Mexican coke. I always have to get one if a restaurant sells it. They're so good.   My husband and I went tonight on the recommendation of a friend. The location is pretty small, so I wouldn't dine in if you're claustrophobic. It's also a bit stuffy inside from the owners deep fat frying the chicken wings.   We ordered a large pepperoni pizza. It came out piping hot; we had to wait a few minutes for it to cool down. The pepperoni was delicious, and good quality. The cheese was also phenomenal. The dough was light and a titch crispy. I really appreciated it.   My husband was a bit disappointed with the tomato sauce; he said it was bland. Honestly, I didn't notice bc the pepperoni and mozzarella cheese were fantastic. Since the owner is splurging on the pizza toppings, I can see where he might not want to spend too much on the sauce.   The buffalo wings were just as hot and fresh as the pizza. I asked for hot sauce, and he delivered. More than likely, he used El Tapatio sauce, and if so then woooooot. Without asking, we automatically received ranch dressing for the wings and the pizza. I told my husband that I'd definitely want to come back. If and when we do, we'll probably call in a take out order."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and go here weekly.  You can't beat the price and the pizza quality is far above all the chain places at comparable price.  It is consistently good and a must try for a cheap pizza pie."}
{"text":"Great food. The pizza is better than streets of NY or Domino's. I like it and I'd order it to go next time. The location I wish I had better words for.  Pizza is great. Location is butt. It's in the heart of a small ghetto. Small strip mall in a rough part of town. Not a place I'd send my 16 year old daughter to  pick up zah herself.  Get it delivered. They have a monster size pizza. Must be like 4-5 feet in diameter.  Pizza. Wings. Mexican food."}
{"text":"It was a Great experience. I ordered the wings and a meatball sub.  The wings came with enough sauce that it was finger licking good with each bite. The meatball sub reminded me of the subs I used to get back east."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger was awesome french fries World unbelievably good homemade fresh-cut bathrooms are cleaned and open to the public"}
{"text":"Wow!  I was nervous about ordering from a pizza place with Mexican entrees, but the reviews were great and the prices were better. Plus it's really close and I always look for small business to support. I was not disappointed!   I got a Hawaiian pizza, a pepperoni, and some cheesy bread. Tax tip and delivery fee brought it to less than $30.  The bread was SUPER cheesy. The kids loved it all, no complaints about not liking tomato sauce or the crust or pepperoni or ham or whatever they choose to be picky about tonight. They ate everything.   Next time I'm getting tacos too."}
{"text":"The pizzas are delicious and affordable! This place has become a work favorite!  It is cheaper to order the special and pick up. Hidden in a small plaza, but a super find!"}
{"text":"Pizza has no flavor and do not recommend the chicken stripes might as well so them at home. Yes it's cheap but I rather pay for something that's good than to throw my money in the trash"}
{"text":"We had to order the pizza on line. The phone was either busy or sent to voice mail. The pizza was never delivered but my credit card was charged. They didn't respond to the email that asked about my experience. Totally unacceptable. I ended up ordering from Papa John's where the service was near perfect. We ended up eating 2 hours later than expected."}
{"text":"Came to pick up my order and was going to use the first time purchase 15% off deal and they said its only good with online purchases. It would be a good idea to explain that on their offer. When I was going to pay for my order the lady at the register said the delivery person took their card reader and I had to wait for the worker to return in order to pay with my card. This is very poor service in my opinion. They should not advertise on their door they accept cards, if their card reader is not availble  at the restaurant. Was very dissatisfied with my first time experience here."}
{"text":"This place is full of incompetent employees with rude customer service! We have been waiting for over 2 hours for pizza, WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN!! Would give it no stars if it would let me."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  The sauce was acceptable.  Price was great.    But the lady who took my order of an extra large pizza with onions, green peppers, sausage, and extra garlic forgot the sausage!    So we ate a vegetarian pizza for the Stanley Cup.    If it wasn't for the error in the order, it would have been 5 stars.    But we will get them again for sure.  Probably tonight if they aren't closed."}
{"text":"Good solid pizza choice locally. I had the taco specialty and it had plenty of fresh toppings and lots of cheese. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I will never know if the food here is any good. I never got my order. Apparently, the delivery guy's GPS is useless. After one hour went buy, I called. Girl on the phone said the delivery guy said he went to my house but I wasn't there. Um, no, not only was I there, but sitting in my front yard waiting for him. Girl said she'd call him (after I confirmed my address) to come right over. Hour two passes (I live less than a mile from their store), so I called back, told them to cancel my order and refund my debit card. Well, apparently that's also impossible since I ordered through the YELP app. Seriously???"}
{"text":"The pizza at Cela's is consistently good. And it's inexpensive. A large 14\" pepperoni that barely fits in the box and a bottle of Mexican Coke ($1.50) was just a few pennies over $7.  I have had the pizza from Cela's at least 10 times now. Each time it was consistent with the last. It has a soft chewy crust, the sauce is slightly sweet with good flavor and the cheese and pepperoni are good too.  Don't let the run down strip mall it's located in turn you off this place. Don't let the divey interior turn you off it either. It has an A health inspection rating. When I want a quick and inexpensive pizza but still want quality pizza, this is the place I call. It beats the flavor and size of the $5 Little Caesar's, it isn't greasy like a Pizza Hut Pan and has better flavors and a better crust than Domino's or Papa John's. Support a place that is locally owned and has a better pizza than the big chains.  Still just as good as it was when I wrote my original review above in 2014. I also love the carne asada burritos. The red sauce has some serious heat to it."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Cela's. Overall good quality food. Original pizza crust is light and fluffy yet crispy on the bottom. Sauce is tasty, not overwhelming. Zucchini were a little dark and breading fell off. Ranch tasted more like mayo. Definitely ordering pizza again. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the taco pizza and the cheese bread.   The cheese bread was awesome, like really really good. Very fluffy, cooked well and had a ton of cheese.   The staff was super nice and the food was pretty cheap.   This is where the good review ends.   The taco pizza was super soggy and gross, my girlfriend and I ate a slice each and decided we couldn't eat another. We are college students and literally couldn't bring ourselves to eat 2 slices the pizza was so bad."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza joint in the neighborhood. Every time we go, we get the carry out one topping special. The pizza is always super tasty, with a proper crust-sauce-cheese-topping ratio. Can't beat the price either. :)"}
{"text":"They use to use beef pepperoni now they don't. I or dared mushrooms and he gave me a plan cheese pizza. Not cool. Go to Little Ceasars."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since I lived on the east coast. Amazing wings too... Freaking bomb EAT HERE!  Everything was cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"This is an excellent little place!  I have been here several times and the pizza is excellent for the price. Their service is always fast too. Much better than those chain places."}
{"text":"Go to spot for pizza, at least once a week. Best deal on pizza around and delicious. Family owned have seen father and son working most of the time. Do not hesitate going here!"}
{"text":"This is a good solid little inexpensive hidden pizza joint. Everything is handmade right in front of you if you pop in, and they deliver as well. Celas's has been open for a long time, but hasn't ever appeared on Yelp. The owner is really nice and so I figured I would help him out and put him on the map.   It's not a fancy place by any stretch - there are still a few small remnants of the Pizza Hut this used to be, and it isn't candles and tablecloths. Don't expect to be wowed by the atmosphere, but the kitchen is clean and it smells good inside. For the price, you're going to be hard pressed to find much better.   The 5 stars are for the value you're getting here... the bang for the buck. I'm not ready to put this on my list of top pizza joints in the Valley, but it's certainly a good little hidden neighborhood option."}
{"text":"Got into Phoenix late and wanted to order something to be delivered.  Found this place nearby the resort and decided to try it.    Food - I ordered the carne asada fries, chicken wings hot, and a pretzel.  It was plenty of food and most went in the fridge to eat as a late night snack the next day.  The carne asada fries were delicious with little cubed steak, sour cream, cheese, jalapeno and pico de gallo.  This hit the spot.  The wings were alright.  Extra crispy wings were a little light on meat, but the wing sauce had a slow burn and wasn't bad.  The pretzel was good dough topped with parmesan cheese.  Delivery - It was delivered fairly quickly.  He did have issues with the credit card machine, but was able to get it fixed.  Overall Recommendation - I would say yes to ordering again.  Their pizzas probably are good by the taste of their dough for the pretzels.  Not a bad price for the quality and quantity of food.  Fast delivery and good food for a fair price."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome pizza and they offer take out deals that make the price point quite reasonable. We get this pizza at least once a month, more if we are on the east side more frequently."}
{"text":"Rude staff the pizza was okay I must admit that the pizza sauce did taste fresh sweet light it had all the elements but after dealing with the rude lady at the counter the pizza could have been from new York and tasted like crap wouldn't go back...wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy"}
{"text":"Super friendly, and great deal, for the $$.  When they say: \"20 minutes!\" they mean 20 minutes, and not 2 hours (as John B. stated).  I honestly don't trust his review (FYI), as I have been going to Celas for over a year, and have never had an issue.  The husband and wife team treats me with respect.  I feel appreciated as a patron.   Celas pizza isn't fake, like Little Caesars.  The dough is much closer to NY style, like I enjoy.    Our entire family recommends Celas."}
