{"text":"This is a fine place if you take it for what it is.  They have cheap food and cheap drinks.  The beer selection is okay, not the largest I've seen but large enough.  For some reason they don't turn the light on in their beer cooler so you might miss the fact that they have a pretty good selection of bottled beer to go with the 5 or 6 beers on tap.  The food is not exceptional but good bar food and very cheap.  The wings are delicious.  My main complaint is the staff, they are somewhat friendly but tend to forget about you while they wrap themselves up with whatever friends have stopped by to visit the bar.  You might sit there for 6-8 drinks and have great service and then poof, the bartenders disappear to go hang out with their buddies and you don't see them for 20 mins.  My other complaint with the staff is they can't really answer any questions about what they have, for instance if you ask if they have a porter they give you a strange look and then run through what they have on tap a few times.  The bartenders don't really know what various kinds of beers are which can be frustrating if you're looking for something in particular."}
{"text":"So, the drink prices are good! Nice specials selection.   BUT the apps were terrible. They were all frozen, over-priced and small as hell. You'd think 3 different apps could feed 4-5 people who'd already had dinner, but that wasn't the case. Just your average crummy apps you could make at home."}
{"text":"I love this place.  There is a dickhole that is internationally lowering thinks place.   He seems like a bitch"}
{"text":"Happy Hour staple...house wine 1/2 price on Tuesdays.  Ordered pizza to go...chicken BBQ...I loved it!  Thin crust, flavorful toppings...Bartenders are fantastic! Cozy bar."}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood bar! Good food and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Love this place! (I might be biased because I live next door). But the staff is great. Good drink specials. Trivia Tuesdays are fun & the manager is trying to bring in more nights similar. There's pool tables and TVs to keep you entertained. The food is decent. I wouldn't rave about it, but it's good. Typical bar food."}
{"text":"I went here this past week (Halloween to be exact) and it was the first time I ate here. It was great! Honestly for a place called the Corner Pub I would think that they have greasy mediocre bar food, but nope the food here is really good!! I had their Cesar wrap and I loved it. Truly it was tasty! The Bar tender was awesome and there is a lot of seating. Only thing that I really don't like about this place is parking, good luck! Unless there is a lot close by that I don't know about the street is the only option, and it's tiny and difficult to find a spot. Over all though I truly had a nice time and I will go back :)"}
{"text":"I really contemplated writing this  review because I used to be in the restaurant industry from hostess to manager for over ten years and I know things can happen but when it comes to money, holding my card, double charging me, and then saying you can't help me and walk away it's hard not to say something. Don't get me wrong it's a cool spot, majority of the staff is attentive and food is okay for pub food but holy crap Brian \"the manager\" is the absolute worse! On a busy Saturday I started my tab( with my card) for two beers and an app when my husband went to go close the tab they asked him to pay for it and he assumed I didn't leave my card. It's all good that stuff happens, I called Sunday, told them what happened, told them that my husband paid it and they said that's fine yet they still charges my card. I go up there to get my card and tell them they still charged it and they said well where's his receipt ( yet they never told me to bring his receipt ) I told them I didn't have it, I wasn't told to bring it and Brian said I'd have to bring the receipt and he started walking away, a confrontation happened he walked away was the extremely rude when I asked for manager or owners information he said he didn't know anything. All in all what I'm upset about isn't the double charging and them not giving my card to my husband bc let's face it there a business and stuff happens but Brian being so rude and walking away ( which I'm sugar coating ) was what led me to leave a review. So with all that said, yes this is a cool place but the manager is an a** and be careful with leaving a tab open here, check your bank account :/"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this pub but every time I go in here, I get treated like I'm not a local and I'm not good enough to be there. The first time I came here was 2 years ago- the food was nothing special and the service was very slow. They don't check on you to see if you need anything and it takes a long time to get your food even though they are never busy. I decided to give it a second chance a couple months ago and this time it was even worse. My boyfriend and I sat down at a table and got completely ignored for about 15-20 minutes. The place is tiny so the staff walked by constantly, but they wouldn't even make eye contact with us. It wasn't busy at all but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved ourselves to the bar so that we could just order from the bartenders. The bartender ignored us and only helped the couples to the right and left of us. It's like they were going out of their way not to serve us. After waiting at the bar for another 15 minutes and not once being greeted or acknowledged in a total of 30 minutes, we left and we will never be back. You would think they would treat what few customers they have left with some decency."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and friendly atmosphere. Very good and large Quesadillas. Only drawback crowd was a bit youthful for some one of my age. Service was excellent.   Will be back, just not a regular. Its also six miles from home.."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar in Charlotte! Love the wings, sweet chili sauce is awesome. I do really wish that they allowed you to do 2 sauces on 10 wings. They offer so many beers on draft and great daily specials. The location is great for Panther games and any other stops in Uptown."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a late night concert.  It was a Wednesday night, so understandably slow so not much to say about the customer atmosphere, but the bartender was very attentive if not completely friendly.  She took my drink and food order quickly and made sure I always had something to drink.  The food came up quickly and was delicious as was the Sweetwater IPA.  All in all it was a good experience and if I find myself in Charlotte again I will be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Really fucking good wings and onion rings. Seasoned just right..goin again now to grub"}
{"text":"Dana's homemade cheesecake is by far the best I've had. Not only is it light and \"creamy\", it's the perfect blend of nostalgia from her grandmother's recipe while bringing all the indulgences of good ol' cheesecake."}
{"text":"Corner pub has more of a local bar type feel to it.  It's a good change of pace.  A good place to hang with frienfs"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood spot it uptown. Wing special Monday nights is phenomenal you get 15 wings for $10, I especially like the sweet chilli and the jerk. When does not wing night my go-to are the waffle sweet potato fries with the sweet chili chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Been living in 3rd Ward for a couple of years and decided to try a different neighborhood bar on Sunday. This place was surprisingly clean compared to how I normally imagine pubs. The appearance is more in line with a sports bar. Food was typical bar food but very good, as was the service. Good drinks too. The place was fairly busy for a Sunday afternoon which shows you the neighborhood must really like it."}
{"text":"This gem is situated in the middle of multiple apartment complexes ,and always has a steady crowed. On Tuesday nights the bar has a good trivia night for locals and people new to Charlotte. The host knows most of the teams and everyone is willing to except a new team mate or two if people just stumble upon the event. For regulars, the bartenders get to know you pretty fast and it gives the bar a small town feel in a big city. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, if your looking for a quick bite to eat. Hands down my favorite pub in charlotte on a week night."}
{"text":"Channel 70 Productions decided to break early for lunch since we'd been up since the wee hours getting to our set and only been fortified with a bag of McGriddles. Because it was early, few customers were present and service was fast. I had a PhillyBeef and it was nearly perfection. Not very comfortable seating keep the Corned Pub from receiving all five stars."}
{"text":"Bar food was better than your typical bar food! The nachos didn't skimp on toppings and the wings had lots of meat on the bones. (I recommend the sweet chili sauce) We went on a Panthers game night and the vibe was definitely what we were looking for in a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Super cold beers. Great selection on draft and bottles. Upbeat tempo. Super cool spot to stop at and enjoy a beer and some good viddles!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good neighborhood sports bar that is conveniently located in uptown Charlotte, this is your spot. Great for game day and pretty good specials. Food is your typical bar food, but good bar food. At this spot it is about grabbing some no frills food, having a couple beers, watching the game, and enjoying some good company."}
{"text":"Small place,  not very roomy. In their defense there was a college football game on. Took 45 minutes to get 2 sandwiches. I would go back for a beer but definitely not the food. After that wait it was nothing special."}
{"text":"The pub is fantastic, clean spot to grab a drink and bite to eat in Third Ward. My friends and I usually go on Wednesdays ($3 Yuengling drafts and 1/2 priced wine) and Fridays ($3 Mexican beer). They have limited outdoor seating but the inside is spacious and comfortable with a darts and a pool table. The food is surprisingly good for a pub but nothing exceptional. Expect large portions at fair prices (the chicken finger platter is huge) but nothing too flashy. I would recommend the chicken nachos for an appetizer and the Santa Fe wrap, buffalo chicken flatbread or chicken finger platter for your entree. Typically it's not overly crowded and the staff does a nice job getting drinks and food to you quickly."}
{"text":"Great wings cheap beer is the easy start to this rating.   Tuesday is trivia night and is actually real fun! Must visit"}
{"text":"Since my succinct and accurate review was labeled as a \"Tip,\" I'll add on. The Corner Pub is a rare species. It's a great, quaint spot with good beer. So many of the world's problems have been solved here over delicious pints. You come here for good beer, great staff, good peers, and a no judgement zone. Cats and Dogs, Jets and Sharks, Greasers and Socs. You will find someone who will like you, even if you're on opposite sides of the tracks that run behind the building. I love my former home away from home that's within my old building."}
{"text":"Great sports viewing scene!  Excellent service."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and plan on coming back again.  It's got a very casual easy going vibe without being too divey.  Menu has most of the typical bar fare with some interesting twists like calamari sticks.  But I have to point a few shortcomings. - Twice I've ordered wings and despite the place not being super busy they both took over a half hour to come out.  Wings were decent and meat enough but wings should never take more than 20 minutes.  At least they apologized both times. - Most staff is very friendly and attentive but when I've gone when its not super busy bartenders seemed to spending more time chatting amongst each other and checking on their phones than seeing whether everything was okay. Not that you can't have some fun especially when things are slow but don't want to as a customer feel like I'm being an inconvenience. - Needs more staff as some staff pulls double duty running food and serving drinks, made more challenging by the fact the kitchen is in lower half of the bar while the upper half of the  bar is the busier part. Definitely check it out if you're looking to avoid the more crowded and pricey bars around the Epicenter but just be aware it may not be the perfect experience.  But the effort is there at least."}
{"text":"Food was spot-on and Lindsay took great care of us at the bar, even went to the trouble of finding out how to make my semi-obscure cocktail choice.  There's free parking down the street, too. I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Nice quaint averaged sized place. It is your typical bar/restaurant with no real unique qualities.  The beers were ice cold and they do offer very good daily specials. Not a lot of places Uptown offer specials like this. We didn't try any of the food but it looked like an excellent selection of burgers and other bar type things. I will definitely make a trip back here again to give the grub a shot. Also, they supposedly have a pretty good Sunday brunch. $4 mimosas.  Enjoy!  PS  There is a breathalyzer on the wall that you can use to check your BAC before you leave.  Sweet!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"This used to be a cool sports bar Until jimmy, the owner, started trying to score with all the drunk girls at the pub.   His wife finally put a stop to it.  And even the last manager, bill, was cool.   Then the current manager, Brian, who is the worst possible person. He is from New Jersey. And is just a bitch of a person.   He doesn't care about anything or anyone but his bitch ass friends.   The food is awful and the people are the worst.   So much potential for such a small crappy bar.   Such a sad excuse for a neighborhood bar.   Sell it. Put a bar there that is cool. Has decent food.  And a decent and friendly manager.   Zero stars for jimmy and its staff.   ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Friendly establishment good food for the price. Great drink specials and good service."}
{"text":"We came here last night to celebrate Va's birthday and watch the Panthers game. I was surprised to find it wasn't too packed like when we walked in for a Sunday football game. Still, our friends scored the last available table. Our server was great, very attentive and constantly checking up on us. We didn't have to wait long for drinks and the food also came out fairly quickly.   The special was miller light and corona light buckets. Our Jameson pickle back shots were $7, not bad. The grilled chicken quesadilla plate was pretty big complete with chips, salsa and sour cream. Also good.   We'll definitely be back. Had to wait till 12:30 to uber back, surcharges are unreal."}
{"text":"I started going here to watch football on Sunday's with friends.  It is nice location, with 2 bars, and it is usually not too crowded, which is the biggest plus.  It is definitely a nice place to go when you want to change things up and go to a smaller bar, rather than go to a more crowded bar uptown."}
{"text":"This is an A-OK place, but nothing I would take visitors to see.   It's a surprisingly clean place for being called a Pub - not dark, dirty &  dingy which I typically would think of when I hear the word Pub. They have a few tv's above the bar for sporting games, a pretty good draft selection, a very \"local\" feeling and the service is decent.   The only drawback to this place is the area around the bar is not very big - kinda long and skinny so trying to make your way to the restrooms at one end of the bar is kind of a sneak & squeeze through the crowd type of game.    *The best tip about this place: there is usually a ton of open street parking nearby"}
{"text":"Love this place! Was waiting for a friend to fly into the airport after having driven from SC. Had a beer, a great meal, great price, pleasant staff, friendly vibe, good location. Looks like most patrons are locals. Amazing gem of a find in an unfamiliar city. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
