{"text":"I had to do some business downtown and needed to wash 2 king comforters. I was dreading this, but now that I found  this place I have nothing to worry about. I will be washing my comforters more often! This place was clean and everything was in working order. The woman that ran this place was a sweetheart.  She told me what machines to use  which dryers would be best, and helped me fold these huge blankets!.  I accomplished the whole task for under 10$ saving me about 40$ if I had used a dry cleaner.  She even said I can leave and come back, thus I was able to visit my friends art gallery and do some shopping, and get lunch at Dave's. XOXO"}
