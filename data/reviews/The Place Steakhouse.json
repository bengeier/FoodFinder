{"text":"Best pizza in town, in my opinion!! Small, clean retro restaurant, but nice atmosphere. Really good Caesar Salad. We usually have the Chicken Hawaiian pizza because it's not very salty at all and it's delicious! Crust is excellent, too. Every time I go, I say I'm going to try something different, but the pizza is so darn good, I give in and end up having it every time! Service is always friendly and efficient. Kelly usually serves us and she's such a sweetheart! And a fantastic server! From my experience, the price is average and comparable to other pizza places.  If you want an excellent pizza, I'm pretty sure The Place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"the place is great used to order from there years ago recently came back to it and i am glad i did . I have ordered pizza and steak and everything was done perfectly . service and food quality is awesome no matter if you eat in or order for delivery quality does not wavier . highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought I would deviate from my usual pizza place and try out this Place, ha ha.  I had heard only rave reviews about their pizza, so why not?  The Place is an older restaurant, it has a small town feel to it.  I walked in and picked up a menu, there were only a few tables full.  The pizza is quite pricey, $20 for a 12\", $30 for a 16\"!  You can get $5 or $7 off if you order 2.  So I ordered 2- 12\", which is a large, with the toppings of my choice.  The woman said it would be about 25 minutes.  When I returned they didn't seem to know who I was, I paid for my pizza and left.  When I got home, which is only a block away, the pizza looked yummy and was hot.  The crust is sweeter and was very good!  There was quite a bit of cheese on both pizzas.  The pizza was a bit greasy, but not too bad.  They did forget my green pepper, even though the lady wrote it down.  For $17 a pizza they should get the toppings right, if you ask me.   Overall, I wouldn't order pizza from The Place again, perhaps I would try their lasagna instead.  For the price, the quality and quantity just wasn't there for me."}
{"text":"I like this place for inexpensive beers/wine and fish and chips. For $12, you get a good portion, longish piece of fish, nicely fried. Chips and fish are always hot and crisp. Good value eats in Bowness.   My in-laws and I always stop by for dinner. You can always get a table even though its usually more than half full. Service is always friendly and attentive. Pastas and steaks seem to be a popular option with the other customers."}
{"text":"On our way out of Calgary we stopped at The Place Steakhouse. I shared a pizza with my son, half cheese and half Daddyza (get it Daddy - Pizza) it's bad I know but I try :). Now back to the food, the pizza was old school, it had a decently thick crust and heavy on the cheese. The waitress was kind and friendly, I guess she's been working at the place since 98. Old school decor with high wooden booths along the outside and tables fill the middle. The pizza was good we shared a medium it filled us and we left with no left overs. I'd stop in again for some Za."}
{"text":"Great food great service great place overall!!! The Italian pizza was amazing! The service was quick and the restaurant was very friendly with our 3 little kids ages 1,3,8."}
{"text":"Went for a late bite to eat after a long day. Being new to this area,  I wanted to find a spot for a quick decent meal. It was pasta night with 15% off on a Tuesday, but I had a steak sandwich, which was done perfectly and very tender.   All the extras were piping hot, except of course the salad. Very satisfying casual meal. The waitress was friendly, and service was good. They have take out and delivery, so I may try a pizza from there one of these nights.   The atmosphere is casual & comfortable. I was there during a slow time, and was pleased that the service was still prompt. A decent family restaurant which I will return to occasionally.  Went back a second time for pizza. I was not as impressed with the service. A different waitress was on shift and the atmosphere was more rowdy, which I was not in the mood for. Still, the pizza was good, and it hit the spot, once again."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner on our way back in from Banff. Very old school decor that made me feel nostalgic, and so did the deep fried mushrooms!! Awesome!! We both had steaks and baked potatoes they were reasonably priced and tasted great! Only problem was they had no green onion or chives for potato's!!! Our waitress was super and we definitely will return"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and Caesar salad but pasta is rather unsatisfying and bland. The delivery man is always so friendly and prompt! Definitely a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"Just moved in and though....moving needs pizza. The pizza can really quickly and was alright but the price seemed a little high. I am sure as Time goes by I will give this place a few more chances but at this point after a disappointing first outing. I am relying on the word of mouth from others."}
