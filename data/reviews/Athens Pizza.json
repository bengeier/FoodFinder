{"text":"Although the pizza is decent the way they treat there customers is appalling.  Every Saturday at noon a group of dancers frequent this establishment with an adult.  This week like all other weeks they are the only dinners in the place.  3 out of 6 are eating the other 3 are there with there bag lunches although they typically purchase just not this week.  The female \"owner\" tells them if they are not buying food they can't sit and stay in her restaurant.  Now I come from the old school of customer service you see this same group every week and this week three are not purchasing and you are going to be rude.  This is never OK to say to guests ever.  They are the only table in your restaurant on a Saturday lunch.  Good luck to you all but, I will not support a restaurant no matter how good your food is if you treat customers like this.  Still quite appalled at this behavior."}
{"text":"Once again, they go above and beyond! Not only is the food fresh and fantastic but the Owner delivered it!! He didn't even mind my two dachshunds yapping at him! The Itallian Sub, the Gyro, Pizza, Veggie Calzone...it is All delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!!
Great staff. 
The Persian selections are second to none.
Try any of them you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their pizza at all, but their fried chicken is soooo good. It really surprised me, coming from an ethnic place and all. I would still like to try some other things here. Not the best customer service... /: Maybe, I'll be able to add another star or two after the next visit..."}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with my pizza and wings. They also have kebabs and gyros which I will be sure to try next time! Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"thought we'd give it a try after an article in the local paper describing the owners and their efforts here.  While the pizza was acceptable, the decor inside definitely needs a make-over, even for a hole-in-the-wall pizza joint.  A big turn-off was when the ceiling mounted air conditioner clicked on and spewed dark residue over our table.  yech!  Won't be back because of that."}
{"text":"This is one of our two \"go to\" places when we want pizza.  And we almost always get the Great White.  The owners are super nice.  Can't speak for the delivery service, but the restaurant is always clean and ready.  Also try the Hot & Spicy or the BBQ chicken."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years - and have never, ever been disappointed!  Their pizza crust has a wonderful flavor, unlike any I've had before.  Though I actually prefer a thinner crust, the flavor more than makes up for it.  Their crust isn't that thick - it's more like hand-tossed. They put a good amount of toppings on their pizzas - even the small pizzas!  As for salads:  I've only had their Antipasto - which I love - and which explains why I can't seem to venture out and try their other salads.  Their homemade italian-type dressing that comes with the Antipasto salad should be sold by the bottle!   They make a really good steak and cheese too, and though I love meditteranean food, I'm NOT a Gyro fan.  The lady (owner) persuaded me to give their gyro platter a try and I actually liked it.  Oh well, what can I say.  It was really good."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. Antipasto could have been bigger and I wish it had more \"stuff\" in it."}
{"text":"I go there at least one a month and I always have a very good experience.  The owner are friendly and the customer service is always great.  If you trying to have a good Persian food come to this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great pizza, all fresh ingredients, some unique and delicious Middle Eastern fare. I've eaten through the menu and have never had anything that wasn't wonderful.  Get to know the owners. They're genuinely kind people!"}
{"text":"THE absolute best kabobs hands down, in Charlotte!! Just moved here from LA, California, where kabob houses are king. Charlotte has none that compare, except Athens! Always fresh, so much flavor!! Eat there, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Charlotte area, by far. The koobideh, rice and everything else here is exceptional as well. Not many Persian/Iranian restaurants in the area but this among the best I've been to, even compared to LA. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times in high hopes it would be better than the time before. I've had pizza, a calzone, and salad. The salad was actually good. The pizza was alright. The calzone was not good. The bread was flavorless and dry. If the prices were lower I might be able to give it a higher number of stars. The prices are what stops me from trying anything else. I don't want to pay those prices for food that has a high chance of being just OK. 
There are several other places near by that serve Italian and Greek food that are much better quality and better prices."}
{"text":"We got a pizza from here months ago. The pizza tasted great - except for the sausage. I think it was bad. It didn't taste right and we both felt somewhat sick after eating it. I don't know if it was an off day for them or if this is a regular thing. The staff seemed really nice and the restaurant seemed really family friendly, so I feel bad giving a poor review. I will update in the future."}
{"text":"After ordering lunch for my wife and little sister, we waited for almost an hour before questioning what could be taking so long. We ordered some chicken tenders, a gyro, and another app. 
When we called an hour after placing or order to check on it, we were told in very broken English that our order was ready and the delivery guy had just left. ( I live about a mile from here) 
Another 30 minutes go by before i am livid and decide to start making lunch at home. Had my wife call and cancel the order seeing ass it was almost 2 hours after placing the order.
15 minutes later the very loud and obnoxious owner/manager in a gold Nissan, can't forget the car all dented up, seeing as he pulled onto my front lawn. I say thanks but no thanks, he gives an excuse that they were getting ready for something the next day, that's why it took so long. Then don't tell me my food is on the way, don't lie to me. Then when asked to leave he refused, getting very loud and yelling. 
Thankfully my Stallings PD neighbor was out in his back yard, so the owner was asked to leave nicely by me 2x before i threatened to get my neighbor. 
I don't care what food they serve, that man is scary and I would never take anyone in that place."}
{"text":"We ordered three pizza pies to go.  The onions on the pies were from the outside layer and were not edible.  The red sauce had a bad taste.  Considering the taste of their Greek dishes I thought there pizza would have been much better."}
{"text":"Woooow, let me start with the good. The service was very good. Owner was friendly as well. The Italian hoagie was good, the chicken parm was frozen chicken fingers cut up and soaked in sauce. The spaghetti sauce was actually sour a little bit it made my eye twitch. The pizza we had was not good at all. The crust was below average and the pizza sauce had so much oregano in it and just no taste."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place and honestly wasn't super blown away. I got the chicken finger app, a small house special pizza, and the baklava. The chicken fingers were very plain. They essentially were just frozen chicken heated in the microwave. The pizza was pretty good, nothing unique though. And the baklava was horrible, tasted like playdough. I was very disappointed in this, especially this being a Greek place. It was also very small which I ended up being fine with since I didn't eat it. 

Unless you're ordering a pizza I would probably pass."}
{"text":"Best kabobs in Charlotte hands down! Nothing but authentic here. Awesome service too with a very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service! Take the grandchildren there and they love it as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the pepperoni pizza and a salad, big.  We got great service and a salad that was fantastic!  Crust as excellent, and a sauce tasted like it was home-made.

All this cost us, with drinks, around $22.  Good price, great pizza."}
{"text":"Try their Persian dishes. The koobideh and chicken mixed platter is to die for! You won't regret it. Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in the area.  We drive from Waxhaw to Stallings just for this pizza...it's that good!  If you like New York style pizza, then this is not for you.  If you like a buttery crust of a medium thickness, fresh toppings, chewy cheese, and moderately spicy pepperoni then you should give it a try!  Their gyros, eggplant, hamburgers and Italian subs are also delicious.  I also can't say enough about how nice the owners are.  They are there on a daily basis and seem to have a genuine passion for what they do.  We love Athens!"}
{"text":"Just out of town - actually just out of several towns, as the address is Matthews, but they are not far from Stallings, Indian Trail and Monroe - you'll find a tiny building that looks more like an oil change than anything else. Go inside and it looks like it used to be a Subway or some other sub shop. In fact, it might have been - the plastic seats are much like the chairs that reinforce that stereotype.

Once you belly up to the counter, however, the menu is much different. The staff is friendly and will help you through the menu. Though it says \"pizza\" on the sign, you actually can order a variety of Greek, Italian, subs and pizza -so it works well for the family that has no idea what they want.

Prices aren't bad either, and portions come out well-sized and fairly quickly, so it works well on a whim.

The food itself is a nice change from delivery pizza, especially with the various options in addition to pizza, but it certainly isn't authentic. Nice for a change-up now and again, however."}
{"text":"Very nice place, and friendly staff. I go there whenever I can. The pizza is great and the kebabs are so delicious...One of the best places I had kebab in USA is in here."}
{"text":"This is not the place to order pizza. If you do, you are missing out on an exquisite experience. I'm not a food person. I don't enjoy eating. Their food made me audibly moan with each wonderful bite! Chicken kabobs with saffron sauce served with the fluffiest Basmati rice I've ever had. It came with grilled tomatoes. A side of fresh mint, and cilantro springs including a chunk of raw onion wrapped in plastic wrap. Also included in the small container there was a tiny cup of a green sauce that I wish they would bottle. So fresh, so tasty. My normally irritable stomach is singing softly. It's like music for your mouth. This should become a stylish kabob restaurant, only if they realized how great it is to finally have found fresh food."}
{"text":"Food: Very good restaurant. I actually came here for the Kabob (Persian food). It was really good, the meat is very tender and flavorful. 

Service: The owners and servers are all so sweet. 

Pricing: It was a little more expensive than I'm used to, about $10 for the dish."}
{"text":"The Best Veggie pizza EVER. Also the Iranian food is excellent and very reasonably priced. This is my favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The food is excellent!,  I got the mixed Kabob,  it comes with zaffron rice and roasted tomatoes,  the Greek salad was very fresh. Fried chicken & Baklava was great too. Don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"I'd say between a 3.5-4 but I'll go closer to 4! Can't speak for the pizza but they have nice hummus and kebab dishes, great salad dressing and well cooked meats. The pita isn't the best but the service is fast and a good alternative when other better kebab places are too crowded"}
{"text":"The kabobs here are so delicious and the herb and onion accoutrement made it even yummier.  This tastes like the delicious Persian food that I've had when visiting larger cities.  So glad this place is so close by.  My husband normally get the meat lover pizza. Pizza is good but the kabobs are definitely where it's at.  Will have to try the lamb chops next time."}
