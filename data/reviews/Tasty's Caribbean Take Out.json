{"text":"Just came back from toronto. We stumbled upon this place was we were walking along yonge st. My bf is guyanese and so I have had my fair share of jerk chicken. I am usually not a fan  of it. But I really luved it from this place!!  The chicken was moist, the sauce was good. I also had this other sauce the had ( white) which gave a nice kick and more flavor. The rice was also good!.  The chicken roti was the bomb!! This place is a must! The owner was also super nice!! a great gem"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I had the $3.99 lunch special (11am-3pm) - jerk chicken (or you can have BBQ or curry), rice with beans and coleslaw, and ate it outside on a sunny day at a table on their mini patio... perfect! I also came right from the Elmwood Spa... at least after you spend $$$ at the spa you can come have a delicious inexpensive lunch. Yeah, the best things in life really don't have to cost that much!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the $5 lunch special.    I got the lunch special with rice and peas and the jerk chicken, seriously for the cost this is a crazy good deal!  The rice and peas was standard, my preference is a little wetter but that's just my personal preference (next time I'll just ask for extra gravy).  The jerk chicken was delicious, super tender and really delicious.  Again for $5 for lunch you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This was the worse excuse for Caribbean food that I have ever tasted. Maybe it is because I am from the Caribbean that I have such high expectations, however, I feel that someone who is cooking a type of food from a specific place should cook It properly.  The rice was hard and tasteless even by Canadian standards, the stew beef was cooked with ketchup as a sauce which is probably the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a while. Lastly the callaloo was disgusting. For those who don't know what that is, it is made from a leaf/ plant that is cooked well with ochra and other seasonings and swizzle led thinly to create a tasty sauce like dish to be served over rice or drank separately or with the meal. Overall- terrible- don't ever eat here if you like your taste buds."}
{"text":"I got charged $6 for the special, so i don't know if price went up or what. The food is pretty good. Their jerk chicken was nicely spiced. Their chicken (if you've eaten at Ritz before) is not slide off the bone goodness, but it was still pretty good. Chicken was not that dry and it was good overall. The coleslaw was a little disappointing. Rice was good too! it did not have that weird after taste some rice and peas do.  All in all, a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"This place is small and unassuming.  I've passed it so many times and seen it packed during lunch hours.  Some how after going to the spa at Elmwood, I ended up having a big craving for Chicken Roti and could not pass it up.  I walked in and asked for Chicken Roti and was happily greeted by a lady and the front steam table and a gentleman working the kitchen.  True Jamaicans speaking Patois!  I got to even practice a few words!  :D  Chicken Roti and a Coconut cake (drop) came out to a little over $10 out the door.  I enjoyed the Roti very much and will be stopping by whenever I'm in the area (which is quite often).  Shhhhh....this is going to be my little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd mention this for those who eat halal.. their curry chicken and goat meat are Halal. I was disappointed as I really wanted to try the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Tasty's is one of the best caribbean places I've eaten in downtown Toronto. Normally you might go to Ritz but this small shop on Elm offers the same $3.99 lunch special but PACKS the container with jerk chicken, rice, and coleslaw. Definitely recommend this place - you can't eat in as it's take-out only but boy you'll always come back."}
{"text":"I realize how lame it is to describe Tasty's as being tasty, but to be completely honest, that's exactly what it is. Okay, you can also describe them as cheap and cheerful as well as quick, but tasty is first and foremost how I would put it. The jerk chicken with rice and beans lunch special for $5 is an out of this world deal. For a handful more change, you can add on a side of coleslaw to round things out.   I've eaten at this tiny joint in it's many incarnations over the years, but Tasty's is definitely one of my favourites so far. The small space is so fragrant with spices and rices that it's literally mouthwatering just to sniff it all in while looking over the dedicated menu and hot trays."}
{"text":"Maybe I expect too much after reading these 4 and 5 star reviews??  Maybe I expect too much from a $3.99 lunch specials??  Maybe I just unlucky?  The Jerk Chicken with rice and peas I got today as a snack was really disappointing! The chicken itself was really dry and lack any jerk spice/rub.. the sauce is this strange sauce tasted like something from the supermarket shelf.. garlicky and sour at the same time...  The lady at the counter was in such a bad mood... no smile, no greetings... and she didn't even have change for my $20..... and 15 minutes later, there was this big fight between the staffs there..and customers just walked out without ordering....  The only enjoyable experience was the little patio... at least I can enjoy my dry Jerk Chicken outdoor under the sunshine!  They don't have any Coconut Cake though.. so disappointing!"}
{"text":"For my jerk chicken craving, I specify went to Tasty's Caribbean Take Out to try it out.  And after seeing soo many positive reviews, how can I not come here right?  I ordered the large Jerk Chicken dinner for $8.99 as I was heading home from work... eating it now and am definitely disappointed.  The chicken is dry and tho it has that typical Jerk taste, it was and is really really salty.  The rice was not fully cooked and had far too many crunchy bites.  The colesaw is swimming in mayo and was not as refreshing as one would hope.  I think the problem is the jerk chicken, instead of being kept warm with the typical jerk chicken gravy.. it was waiting upon a little metal stand under the heating hoods.  And after being kept hot all this time, it will get dry.  I'm not sure if they sprinkled salt on top, but it's really really salty.  Paying $10.16 after tax, it's really disappointing.  It's not cheap and for this kind of quality it's unacceptable.  The lady behind the counter was really nice and yeahh I probably got more chicken than at Ritz for an example... but when it's this salty and the rice is not fully cooked... trust me, less is definitely more.  Heading to Ritz next time."}
