{"text":"Great food and service all at good prices  The decor is a lot of fun.  The only reasons for not giving a 5 star is the long wait on occasion, and that it can be so noisy its hard to hear your dinner partners"}
{"text":"Best Mexican  restaurant I've  ever had. Taco's are really  affordable  especially  on Tuesday's. The pork taco  is the best!!! Great margaritas as well :) Staff are really funny & friendly. Definitely my husband & I go to spot when we feel like eating Mexican food! Lots of parking space too."}
{"text":"Food was good and tasted fresh. However, I would've liked the chips, salsa, and queso to be more fresh and flavorful, and not so generic tasting. The fajitas were yummy, but would prefer the chicken to be in strips rather than small pieces that I had to pick out myself. Flour tortillas tasted like store-bought tortillas. Overall, good, but not even near the greatest. Good enough for a Texan away from home."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Not great, but not bad. There are not really any quality Mexican restaurants in the area. In comparison to some of the others, I would rate it \"better\" but the bar is not very high. The new location is very loud inside. It's a open floor plan with a hard floor and a metal ceiling (not quite as loud as wild wings). The parking is better, I will give them that. Their salsa has always been good.

Our issue with our last visit was our waiter's attitude. It was a cross between cocky, arrogant, and just rude. Didn't wait for responses, looked at me and said \"take out your straw\" when I needed  refill, then vanished for a good 10 minutes. Failed to ask if we need a box, desert, more to drink.. walked by and dropped our check on our table and left. We were left a bit baffled by the whole experience. It's not like we stopped by his house and are eating for free. They were busy, but that should not be an excuse.

I doubt we return. It's not worth it for the average food."}
{"text":"Above and beyond my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I had been a loyal diner at another restaurant nearby, but it was recommended that I try Fiesta Jalapeños in Medina.  All I can say is I will never go to another Mexican restaurant again.  Customer service is incredible..the staff is friendly and always have smiles on their faces.  The food..is incredible!  From the meat dishes..to fish dishes to the array of vegetarian options.  I even asked for a special request of a jalapeño margarita..and they made it perfectly!  Can't wait to go back!  I recommend you visit Fiesta Jalapeños soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here. The staff is so friendly and very efficient and the food is always fresh. We drive 25 minutes to go to this restaurant and we have 2 mexican restaurants right down the street from us. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good quality Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Clean. Always busy ,friendly,fast,great food. Great service! Excellent staff!! 
Only minor complaint bar lights to bright(had to dig for that one). Will continue to return. Always good!!! Been going for years! Not to many places I can say about that! Top notch!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever eaten. Flautas are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I live really close so I'm here once a week. I really enjoy the good this place has to offer, I recommend if you like spicy the \"burrito de la diabla\", steak, chorizo, hot sauce and a cheese sauce on a burrito. Mmmm!

I've been eating here for 3+ years and it continues to be a consistently excellent experience with very good food and a great atmosphere. 

Also: Texana Margarita. Get the big one."}
{"text":"Fiesta Jalapeno! Has a great atmosphere that reminds me of a banquet style restaurant we visited in the Yucatan many years ago. All of the servers were whirling around in organized chaos, delivering chips and salsa, dinners and drinks with reckless abandon. No sooner was a glass emptied than it was whisked away and refilled immediately. The margaritas and daiquiris were enormous and we ordered the regular sizes. They were made perfectly and not watered down. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our wait to be seated was tolerable but plan to spend a little time waiting in the bar because there is always a wait at the dinner hour and beyond. The food was good but not great. I had the chicken fajita which was served piping hot with tons of fresh grilled vegies, warm flour tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, salsa and cheese in the side. The chicken was a little rubbery but the spices were great. All in all a fun night out."}
{"text":"We were not pleased with our dinner last night. I ordered the Fiesta dinner. In my dinner, first bite was the stem of the pepper. It was hard and stringy. Lucky I didn't get chocked. I brought it to the attention of the waitress , she laughed. It was also smothered in cheese and sauce. The only thing I recognized on the plate was the rice. New menu and price has increased. Chips and salsa was the only bright spot. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Very average as far as Mexican goes.   Kind of disappointed...   Will continue looking for good Mexican in the area

Came at 4:00 PM, only two other tables were sitting.  

Was going to rate a 3, but our waiters service brought it up one star!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. Great food , nice decor & staff is nice. Will become a regular restaurant in my list of favs."}
{"text":"Great food and margaritas.  Good to very good service.  Clean, happy.  My go to for American/Mexican food.  Somewhat altered for America's' tastes."}
{"text":"only mexican restaurant i enjoy! great service,drinks and food! the staff always remembers me and my family and I love Alex he is the best!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever. I have had better food at a gas station. Good thing the chimichanga was only 3 inches long because it was chewy, the beef had a terrible texture and no flavor. The rice had freezer burned vegetables and the refried beans had a weird layer of sweat. The Margarita was straight sour mix, sent it back. The service was terrible. Hostesses were lost and rude. Had to ask twice for menus and the waiter never checked to see how things were.  They placed a bench right outside the front door so all the smokers could blow smoke in the door."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff, fast service, tasty food, and amazing salsa. I cannot count the number of times a I've eaten here, and I consider it to be in the top 3 restaurants in Medina for a good meal."}
{"text":"Had lunch here about a month ago.  Service was great and enjoyed the food.  We had tacos, burritos, and enchiladas ordered.  One of our guest was not impressed but she likes it spicier and her spouse who loves to cook is from New Mexico where he claims it's food is more authentic.  Doesn't bother me,  saves my digestive system from overload.  I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"The place is good with their Mexican style. Everything there is good. This is the place where you can have a party."}
{"text":"North Ridgeville's claim to fame!  Best Mexican in Cleveland.  Good and fast service.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Honestly a really good place and the wait staff is pretty decent especially the bartenders. Get the \"coronarita\" if you are feeling frisky"}
{"text":"I'll start with the free ships and salsa while you wait for the meal, fantastic.
The atmosphere is a bit chaotic, but it's all part of the experience. The waiters are continuously busting their butts in an effort to provided the best service. In addition to the serves being fast an efficient, all waiters have a Mexican charm that makes me feel welcome every time. The food is tasty and as a regular customer, I like to switch it up when I can. My favorite is the $1.25 tacos every week on Tacos Tuesday, but everything is great"}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients.  Portions are good size. Price is on par with similar restaurants.  Great experience and service!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the area!  The New restaurant is much bigger and the parking lot is much bigger.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My brother and his girl friend went  their last night September 17,2013 for dinner they both woke up this morning sick like a dog and they raised a red flag which the cause is food poisoning. I encourage everyone Not to go their and take any chances if you are not feeling good at all Please go see your doctor and then determine what you have then notify the Medina county health department for immediate investigation."}
{"text":"It is as good as it needs to be.  Food is consistently good, but nothing will blow you away.  It fills the void that Chi-Chi's left so many years ago.  Food comes out extremely quick and extremely hot, so much so that I fear they may be giving the plates some \"radar love\" in the back.  Have eaten there many times and will go back.  Friendly staff and gimmicky décor."}
{"text":"While this is still, far and away, my favorite local Mexican restaurant, the last few times we've gone I've been disheartened by the service. Last time our server came by to get our drink order then disappeared for what seemed like a long time before coming to take our order. He also didn't really check back with us as to whether we needed more chips or drink refills. 
It's not going to stop me from going back but it's something they should be aware of and try to fix. 
Having said that, no one beats their chimichangas. no one else covers them in that incredible ranchero sauce. i want that stuff on everything."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Fiesta Jalapeño!  This place is always busy and the food and service are consistently great. I decided to forgo my typical chicken fajitas and i tried the chimichangas, they were wonderful and the portion sizes are always generous so you'll need a box!  I love their guacamole and of course ate way to many chips.  I tried the peach margarita tonight and it was very good.  We splurged 
on the the deep fried ice cream. .it was my birthday after all!   One word DELICIOUS!  worth every calorie! Oh almost forgot. ..we had the wings as an appetizer. ..WHAT AT A MEXICAN PLACE? ?? YES and they were very good. ..nice surprise"}
{"text":"Great, tasty, fresh made food at good prices in wonderful setting! This new location offers  ample parking and easy access. 

Wonderfully attentive and friendly staff. 

Best mexican I've had in ohio. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Customer service, y'all. The hombres here not only have bangin' Mexican food, but their service is humble, yet efficient. This is not your typical Americanized Mexican joint! The prices are a little higher, but the flavor and service make up for it. I ordered the tacos with chorizo and beef. Wow! Normally at another Mexican spot it comes plain, but here it came jam packed with seasonings and sauces. The meat was juicy and tender, and the spices were extremely flavorful. 

The chips and salsa were amazing too!

They are really good with big groups. We had a party of 16 and everyone was well taken care of. Definitely worth a revisit!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Chips and salsa to start - always amazing lol. The wait is never long even when super busy .. food comes out SO fast. Never had anything messed up here, staff is super nice .. compared to other Mexican places I'd say it's one of the best but not THE best. Totally go here all the time though and highly recommend my favorite is the chorizo chicken dish. YUM!"}
{"text":"Very large menu. Great queso. I had one of the vegetarian dishes, and my date got pork tacos. It was really good! I would go back."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, the bar was empty and we still couldn't get much service.  The chicken nachos were terrible.  We had maybe 8 chips on our plate and the chicken was barely shredded.  We were seated quickly with our drinks but for a Mexican place you'd think they could make a plate of chicken nachos, but they were awful."}
{"text":"Had a taste for Mexican on Saturday and Happened to be in Medina, just so happened to be in the vicinity so we thought we would try it. Nice place, nice atmosphere. The quality of the food is well above the prices. I will be back. I had a Burrito and could NOT finish it. between the Burrito and the excellent rice this place has me hooked. I cannot wait to try some more. A great selection of menu items.

The staff was very attentive and friendly without being pushy. Meal started out with the requisite chips and salsa. We ended up with water this time for a drink. The order was taken and in short order delivered. very tasty and NOT GREASY!! cannot tell you how happy I was that it was NOT GREASY... Even better it was very tasty, bordering on unique with an interesting and pleasant taste to the Burrito. 

Highly recommend you try this if you want great Mexican food at a very reasonable price. could use wi-fi but I will not ding them for the absence."}
{"text":"I go about once a month. Love this place.. Fast, friendly service. Great food, and they make awesome margaritas!"}
{"text":"i hate here and the lady who served our food brought it to us and said \"sorry we left it in the microwave\"   the taco el pastor was dry and nasty maybe because they left it in the microwave too long... if i wanted microwaved food id eat at home for cheaper!!"}
{"text":"They had good food and service was very good.  A little dark inside and the table protector was peeled away."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for table. Peak dinner time though. 
Queso dip was too thin like water.  Chips n salsa ok. 
Veggies fajitas were pretty soggy, only the zucchini had any grill marks. Cold plate coulda used some cheese or guac. Just lettuce tomato and sour cream. I ordered the lemonade and it was Pink lemonade.. they should edit their menu. Server was great.  I'd look elsewhere for Mexican next time."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Lorain County and vicinity area. I have gone for a girls' night out and a family outing. Either way the chips and cheese are great and my quesadilla is always delicious. Try the strawberry margaritas and daiquiris. They are yummy!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Delicious food. Delicious margaritas. Friendly staff! I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"So good I forgot to take pictures, my love wanted a special drink and they put it together for her no problem, good mole, good pastor and a unique chipotle flavor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great great authentic Mexican food! Delicious margarita. I had tacos that were very good! The portions are huge. The Quesadillas are the biggest I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the most fun tex-mex places I've been. Great service, killer quantities, and tasty food. I strongly recommend Fiesta Jalapeños for a night of fun!"}
{"text":"This is our staple for Mexican in the area! They are always quick and fresh. The chips and salsa are also good. The atmosphere isn't anything special but it's a normal Mexican place with food food. The people working there are always friendly and cordial."}
{"text":"We visited here last night from out of town. We had a party of 8, and we're seated immediately, which rarely happens anywhere. The restaurant was very busy, it was apparent it's a good spot. Our food was great, absolutely great. My only complaint would be that the chips aren't freshly made, which is a common thing where we live in Tennessee. We had margaritas, which were decent, as well. Our bill total was surprisingly good for 8 adults. Overall, we left very happy!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. The chips and fresh salsa are never ending. The queso was my absolute favorite thing on the menu!! Their rice is like a large, soft mound of heaven delivered on a plate. Enjoy it. Savor it. Your life will never be the same, and that my friend is A-OK. 

In all honesty, if you're looking for the best mexican food in the area, this is it. And don't forget the queso."}
{"text":"Love the bacon wrapped shrimp! My favorite! The staff is very friendly! The margaritas are strong! Great salsa, don't think it's fresh, but it's good. Not authentic place, but delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place up to the sky. It is your average and typical Mexican restaurant except they are consistently nailing it. Everyone is so friendly. They are FAST FAST FAST. My water is always full and the chips/salsa is always refilled. I love their house hot salsa you can ask for. I stopped ordering fajitas from other restaurants because everything always seems over-cooked, over seasoned, and dry. Their meat is juicy, the vegetables tender but firm. Portions are big, prices cheap, super clean. Home run."}
{"text":"Best mango margaritas! Food is always hot and fresh. We come monthly because we crave it :) Staff is awesome as well!!"}
{"text":"1.25 tacos on tuesday. Shredded chicken and shredded pork were both good. Havent tried anything else there yet but for that price they are great :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with three girlfriends. Service was quick, server very friendly. The food was hot and flavourful. We ordered a carafe of top shelf margaritas. Very tasty, yumm. Prices are reasonable, you get plenty of food. We ll be back"}
{"text":"Texans margarita pitcher itself deserves the stars for this review. 3 of us got nearly 2glasses and the buzz was noted by the end of the 2nd glass. 
Salsa and chips are standard affair. They have the sauces on the side of the table. 
Polo loco was grilled chicken with the salad, beans and salsa with sour cream. Popeye pollo was good and adding the habanero sauce gave the necessary kick. The grilled chicken looked the same as in the pollo loco. Vegetarian option 78 was nice and heAvy. 
The restaurant is noisy. Service is fast and efficient. 
Overall a good experience worth returning for the margarita or maybe not which I'll let you know if I have a headache the next day!"}
{"text":"great service, great people, horrible food. The cheese in our Enchilada tasted synthetic and wasn't even melted. Will not return."}
{"text":"Was in the area, and this seemed like a decent shot. Full fledged Mexican restaurant, so very few non animal options. Great atmosphere, casual, Mexican themed, but clean, vibrant, and friendly. 

I went with the veggie burro. Holy cow, I found it disgusting. I don't like beans, nor peppers... I made a bad decision. I'm sure it's supposed to taste like it did, but I hated it. My companion went with chicken and rice, and was very pleased. Dinner for two was $35 (26 and change + tip), so not bad, but that didn't include drinks. 

Service got off to a rough start, but after that, our gentleman wouldn't let our drinks get below half filled. I'd recommend it, but I don't think I'll be going back because of their lack of options (not their fault, my dietary needs)."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area since moving to Medina.  The salsa is excellent.  I especially like the grill dishes (chicken mainly)."}
{"text":"Been there a few times

Getting seated is very quick , even on a busy night
Food comes out hot and quick

It is the usual Mexican / American food in open dining area

I like the flavor of their ground beef and chicken they use in their dishes

Will keep going back for my Mexican food cravings!!

Viva!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The only real negative is the price. Otherwise, the service was great and delivers a true authentic Mexican experience. Definitely reccomen. Below is the number 32 which is an enchilada. The guac isnt included in it, that was from my moms dish."}
{"text":"Great service, great food every time. We love this place. We've come here as a couple, the six of us and large groups. It's great any way you like it. Ole !"}
{"text":"They put in a self serve taco bar at the new location which has sour cream, fresh salsa, and lettuce. On the $1.25 taco Tuesday this place is packed. During peak dinnertime the wait is usually about 45 minutes. The food is very good, and once you're seated it comes out fast. My only complaint about this place is the number of kids there. Obviously that is not the facilities fault. The other day I looked around and noticed I was practically the only table in the place without a gaggle of children. One of them was kicking my booth and I kicked his back. That being said the place is usually pretty loud. Not really a great place to take a date. It is one of the few dinner options in the burbs but be prepared to deal with the atmosphere which is not great."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price. We went for the less than $8 lunch especials. We were greated by a thick almost smokey salsa and freshly made chips. Before we could empty the basket our meals came out hot. The cheese sauce on the chimichanga was top tier. The rice and beans were also very good. The whole experience was muy bueno."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I grew up in Ridgeville and I still have family there. I come to Fiesta everytime I am home and have NEVER had a bad experience! There is one server there (Shamefully I do not know his name) but he always takes care of us, and he Always remembers me, even though I am only here maybe 2 or 3 times a year! Food is great and the Service is exceptional! This coming from a guy working in the service industry in Mexican restaurants in NYC! Love you guys!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the spicy salsa, warm chips and white cheese dip.  Service was also top notch - speedy refills on my water and salsa, prompt food delivery to the table.  Large menu includes vegetarian options, seafood and a la carte choices.

I chose the Sampler Fiesta Jalapeno appetizer as my entree.  It includes four wedges of cheese quesadilla, one each shredded beef and shredded chicken flauta, and a heaping mound of shredded chicken and ground beef nachos, all for $9.  This was a large platter of food, and could easily be split by up to four people for a decent appetizer.  I enjoyed the quesadilla dipped in salsa or guac (about 2T is served with your app).  I dipped both flautas, packed with meat, in the side dish of cheese dip ($2.75).  The nachos were good, but not great.

Decently busy the Tuesday night I was there.  Family-friendly.  Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I have to compliment them on their extensive menu of different items. I feel like a lot of Mexican places taste the same and serve the same things. But Here I always try something new and different. The service here is great and very attentive. We were able to take our time and not seemed rushed. The food had a lot of flavor which I liked and taste great. The margaritas are unquestionable good. I am never disappointed and I always order on the rocks for the best value and taste."}
{"text":"We were there for the first time about a week ago. It was very busy,popular place, 25 minute wait. Got seated and the fun started, waiter was pretty Johnny on the spot and the service was so fast. Ordered a pitcher of margaritas, I swear it was 3 minutes and it was on the table. Order our app, and our dishes and more chips 5 minutes later stuff started coming out on a timely fashion. It was quite amazing. A little pricier than other similar places but not to bad for the service and the amount of food."}
{"text":"Have always been met with a smile from whoever is present at the host stand. My wife and i have always enjoyed our dinner and drinks at the bar.

Bartenders are amazing. Polite, great conversation and prompt. Always willing to accommodate you!

Food is always very good and quick. 

Our local favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and hungry. We were trying to decide between Mexican and Chinese. Went with Mexican because it rarely disappoints. This place got us seated right away despite being very busy, incredibly friendly staff, and the quality of food was great. The atmosphere is vibrant and fun, and it seems like this would be a fun place to celebrate a birthday. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm really please with my experience at Fiestas. Each time I've gone there the food has been excellent and the servers bust their butts to get the food to you fast. They're attentive without being pushy and the price is right. Excellent place to visit for Mexican food. One of the better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Not a fan....like most Mexican food restaurants in the area...not real Mexican food, but more like a Caucasian attempt at Mexican food though it is Mexican made. Almost like getting Mexican food T.V. dinners. 
I understand they have to cater to people in an area that do not know true Mexican food, but I would recommend instead of making their dishes bland, they introduce northerners to real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been a regular for years. The food is great, the staff is friendly, the service is fast,  the prices are fair, and there are a lot of specials!
I use the belly app to rack up loyalty points!"}
{"text":"it's a very homie Mexican restaurant for the the North Ridgeville and Avon area. They bring you chips and salsa to start you off, then you can decide what to order from a pretty decent selection of meals. Never a long wait for food. If you want a little side of sour cream. They charge you for it and bring over some huge bowl of sour cream which probably is my only thing I'd change there. Other than that great place to eat and friendly staff always."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday, and on a Sunday night.  Place was busy, and stayed busy through our visit.  As a result, food was slow coming out of the kitchen.  The good news was that our server was both friendly and hard-working, and made sure we were taken care of.  Thanks to one of my family members, they even did the obligatory birthday song...bonus was the shot of tequila which I did not expect.

The food was nothing special..I've had better.  I know places like this cab be inconsistent, so there's a chance we'll be back here at some point."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time a few days ago and the food was excellent. It was also very crowded on a weekday, which usually means it's good! Food was quick and delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not the first time I've had their food and I have been to both the North Ridgeville and Medina locations. However, this is the first time I have had the food taken to go. I do understand the food may not always be the freshest compared to when you eat at the restaurant, but after a 5 min ride home the food should not be cold and the chicken should not look and taste like rubber. Definitely will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Good local tacos. Margaritas are not my favorite but their salsa and cheese sauce are great, you can't really screw that up!"}
{"text":"Awsome food, awesome service. Love this place. I have never been somewhere where the workers cared so much for their customers. Taco Tuesday is fantastic and they also have good prices on their lunch and dinner specials. I am also vegetarian and i can get anything on the menu and get a vegetable blend instead of meat free of charge. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++ LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed our visit here.  They were really busy but were able to seat us right away.  A nice quiet booth in the back was perfect for all five of us.  The service and food was excellent. All for a good price too.  We will definitely be visiting here again soon."}
{"text":"Have tried many Mexican Restaurants, but always come back to here as our FAVORITE!  Have not had 1 bad item.  the Margaritas ..... WOW!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican. There are few Mexican restaurants my stomach can tolerate, and this is definitely one of them. Delicious food and great service at nice prices."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great salsa, cheese dip.margaritas.  Friendly service.  The ACCP is awesome, grilled shrimp and chicken, with excellent beans 
entry is tricky, but worth going!  oh yes, fun on birthdays and for big groups"}
{"text":"Omg.... I've visited many Mexican restaurants, Fiesta Jalapeño Bar & Grill is the best I've been to in Lorain County and beyond! I was very impressed from the moment I walked into this establishment. The ambiance is quite welcoming & comfortable. It's very spacious, with tables, booths or comfy seating in the bar area... They boast a very nice bar area, where you can sit at their bar or sit at tables in bar area. Alrighty then, now the food.... There was \"special\" on steak fajitas, regular $15.99, today $10.99. Great deal!! My cousin ordered that, omg, she had plenty left to take home! I ordered tacos al pastor, THE best tacos al pastor, EVER. Victor, our server was soo friendly, hospitable & eager to make our luncheon a pleasant one! As we all know, half the pleasure of dining out is \"hospitality\", of which Fiesta Japeño's was not lacking! I expressed how much I enjoyed cilantro in my salsa, by golly, Victor made a special salsa for us... #Exceptional. Kudos to you, Victor,  job well done!! Shout out to their hostess, Bri Sherfey... Very pleasant! We look forward to our next visit! #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food in the area. Fast service, huge menu, delicious food, and fun environment. The new location offers more seating and a much larger parking lot."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite Mexican Restaurant!
It's clean, modernly decorated, large, the waitstaff is very friendly, the bar is massive, the food is great (although we have only tried two things so far) and the prices are affordable! I look forward to taking the entire family here!"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas and awesome bartenders.  Had a nice dinner, enjoy the atmosphere, and this place is always busy."}
{"text":"Honestly, hands down, the best Mexican joint in town. FJ's staff is friendly and fast. The rice is next to none and the salsa is so good. Best item on the menu? Carnitas tacos. Ask for a side of chipotle salsa and lime and be prepared to have your mind blown. We've tried all the places in town and none come close to Fiesta Jalapeños. Plus they have a patio!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the food has always been good.  The problem is the male staff, they stand around and stare and try hitting on and flirting with the young girl patrons.  Happened to us with our own daughter and I witnessed it with other families.  This is unacceptable behavior and that is why they receive this rating."}
{"text":"-A Fantastic Second Choice-

After walking out of Thyme2 restaurant (due to being ignored), my friend prompted me to try this place. We were seated right away (even though it was completely packed), and the staff was very quick to take our order. The staff was polite, although our server was very quiet. You get the typical Mexican restaurant decor and the place seemed very clean and well taken care of.

I ordered the Burrito A La Diabla (I think that was the name), which pushed me out of my comfort zone when going to Mexican restaurants. Our food and drinks were delivered quickly. I have to say that it was pretty spectacular; well cooked, spicy, nicely portioned, and included a side of beans and rice.

My experience here may be a tad skewed because I came from such a bad experience. But there really was nothing wrong with this restaurant at all. Good food and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was true Mexican. Delicious snd the staff was great. Descent pricing..nice atmosphere too"}
{"text":"We all have tried a lot of Mexican restaurants in a lifetime, but, Fiesta Jalapenos makes me realize that there's nothing finer! I have tried a couple different Mexican restaurants throughout the 5 years that I've known the Hernandez Familia and know that their product and service is the best around!

My favorite night is going to the new bar with my gal, having Lupe make his famous margarita-on the rocks-w/salt, 3 to 4 Times, then order the steak mexicano  with a \"special request\" of poblano mole, yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"We Yelped this restaurant looking for Mexican food on a trip a long way from home.  The reviews were great and the parking lot was full with a 30 minute wait. The restaurant is quite large and very noisy.  The service was good, but of the two entrees we ordered, the steak was overcooked on one order and the beans were cold on the other.  So the food was ok, but not at all exceptional."}
{"text":"Quick service and great food. I get the chipotle quesadilla almost every time I go because it's amazing.  They send coupons locally which keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Don't order to go if you actually want your food at the time you request to pick it up. Called at 6 to order and requested pick up at 7. I get there at 7 and they haven't even put my order in the computer yet. 20 minutes later I got my food. I'm not sure they understand the concept of having the food ready 'to go'."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. I've been several times trying different dishes and have been pleased each time. The margaritas are delicious and made exactly to our liking. We bring our friends and they feel the same. Our favorite waiter is Jorge. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to Mexican place. But after they moved things went down hill.  Not sure why. But the food is a bit blander. The service not as good.   We go back every so often to see if it's gotten better but it hasn't."}
{"text":"This is my go to, all day every day! Love the staff and service is always above anything I've ever experienced. You want great Mexican food and amazing service... Come on down and visit Fiesta's in North Ridgeville. They will modify the menu any way you want... And let me just say \"Taco Tuesday\"... See you soon!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was really impressed. Great food, Good price. Friendly staff... I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Liked this place. The service was good and quick. The food tasted fresh. I got the chicken tortilla soup and chicken tacos with a hard shell. I liked both. Would go back again."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the quality of the food. We ordered takeout for the first time this past week. My son and I both ordered the 2 chimichanga dinner and my husband got the grande chicken quesadilla. The chimichangas were not even edible. They were filled mainly with huge greasy, soggy chunks of green and red peppers with literally two thick chunks of meat inside. The meat tasted old, chewy, and tough, with no flavor. My son and I both threw out our meals. The \"grande\" chicken quesadilla was also a disappointment. It was very thin, with small bits of chicken and melted cheese. No onions, peppers, or flavor. We also ordered the queso, which was bland and unenjoyable. For the money, your better off going to Moe's or Chipotle. We will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"I come here just about every Tuesday for their taco night. First of all, you'd be hard pressed to find somewhere with more $1.25 taco options than this place. I like the shredded beef and shredded or grilled chicken best, but others in my group swear by the steak and carnitas. I love that they have buy one / get one half off margs and the topping bar (pico, salsas, lettuce, onion, cilantro, tomatoes, jalapeños, sour cream) for the tacos. Yum. Cheap and tons of options? Can't complain. 

They also have killer quesadillas that make me extremely sad I am lactose intolerant because it's hard to not steal the whole thing when no ones looking. 

What really makes this place though is the people. I've been here maybe 8 or so times with a group that been coming for years and it always makes me smile how the entire restaurant staff knows them and always stops by for friendly banter. There's nothing like walking into a restaurant and feeling like you're at home."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here it was great.  This time around it was mediocre and tasted like every other \"authentic mexican restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican. The shrimp seem to be the hidden gem in the menu. 
Only complaint is they try to get you out if ther pretty fast."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place I've visited. It's out of the way for me, but the staff, food, and margaritas make it worth the trip.  

I attend their Taco Tuesdays at least a majority of the year. It's a great deal.  They offer an assortment of different proteins for their $1.25 tacos and there's a bar full of toppings to make your perfect taco. Couple that with buy one get one half off margaritas and Tuesday is the best night here in my opinion. The long line of people shows that others agree. 

The menu doesn't end just at their tacos though. They offer a different meal each day of the week at a special price and it's a good way to find a new food to sample.  They do the classics great as well and I'm often getting their grande quesadilla which lasts me two meals. 

This is a very family-friendly restaurant and the staff makes you feel like family too. You'll probably hear at least one table being sung \"Happy Birthday\" by the workers. On top of that, the owner is normally working behind the bar and gets to know many of the customers. If you're lucky, he'll maybe even share a shot with you. Always a great time here at Fiesta."}
{"text":"Good salsa, friendly staff, and great music. The enchiladas are decent and the service is always great.  I haven't tried their margaritas yet, so that may add another star in the future!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant in Ohio. Everything from the food to the service is great here. If you come I'd order the fajitas and the sampler platter. Portions are large so feel free to share with a friend."}
{"text":"This is my joint! 
Good food, great drinks, and specials on both almost every day (no drink specials on Fridays). The taco bar on Tuesdays ($1.25 each with whatever toppings you want) is unbeatable, especially with nine meat options (chicken shredded or grilled, beef ground, shredded or grilled, fish, chorizo, el pastor or carnitas).
Serving staff, bar staff and even the girls at the counter are great (except Jelly, she's mean but we have fun with it). You can't go wrong here! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food, and they worked with my dietary restrictions. I don't eat, meat, dairy or eggs. They have a really good veggie fajita skillet... and their guacamole is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"A true gem of a restaurant. The fajitas were exceptional as was the service. Tried the chips with guac, cheese dip and salsa and all three were great. A very clean environment to dine"}
{"text":"I only recently discovered this great place.  A friend of ours recommended it, and we were not dissapointed!  They have a great selection of Mexican food, and fantastic service, and the prices are OK.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Restaurant is clean, has plenty of seating, and has an extensive menu. Service is fast even at peak times. Food is inexpensive. There's plenty of parking too. 

We've been frequenting this place since it opened many years ago. It's a favorite of ours. 

Warning: this place is so popular on weekends that the  waiting line can be quite long. Takeout is available however."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Love their food and drinks. The staff is very friendly and the environment is nice. The food is pretty cheap and you get plenty of it."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican food, fabulous service.  Fun mexican music and great drinks.  There is still a great customer service place out there!"}
{"text":"We had Fiesta Jalapens cater food for us and ask them to bring their grill. They brought their grill  and Frier for French Fries for my Son's grad party for 300 folks.  The crew and the owner (Rogelio)  are excellent folks to work with.  They made awesome Vegetarian food with fresh vegetables, jalapenos, sauces, and cheese.  We had spicy and mild both types Vegetarian Fajita with tur choice of veges and sauce; medium and hot salsa with chips, delicious Mexican Rice, Sour cream, Lettas, Onion, Tomatoes and Guacamole. They bough several trays of pre made Cheese enchiladas, Spinach enchilada, and Bean Burritos.  They also made loaded french fries (kids loved it).  Everyone loved the food in their live grill. Awesome set up and very  good presentation.  I must have given 50 folks this restaurant's name and address during the Saturday's party.  Neha and Kalpesh Shah"}
{"text":"The food is great!  Prices are great! Service is great! Great Mole Sauce! Drinks Great! The only thing I don't like is that it is loud in there!"}
{"text":"Since I'm originally from North Ridgeville, Fiesta Jalapenos has been a staple restaurant in my life as I've grown up, and is my favorite restaurant in my hometown. 

There's tons of traditional Mexican art on the walls, which is really cool to look at while eating! They start you off with free chips and salsa, which are addicting. I usually order the cheese quesadilla and bean tostada with a side of rice and beans. The food always comes out steaming and fresh, very yummy!

Since I've turned 21, I've been able to enjoy their alcoholic drinks. There are tons of different kinds of margaritas, and you can mix the flavors. Last time I visited I mixed the strawberry and raspberry flavors, and it was muy delicioso!

If you're still hungry after the meals, they also have a really good fried ice cream that comes with all kinds of toppings!

If you're in North Ridgeville, say hola to Ridgeville's best restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have dined here 4 times now. It's your basic run of the mill Mexican food. The employees are always great and provide top notch service. They are quick and polite. It's not my favorite place to get Mexican food and the prices are a bit higher compared to a few others I have been to which are the only criteria on which I deducted a star. The service is excellent, the margaritas are great and the food is average. It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with family recently.  I get the feeling that they batch cook everything and then heat it up a little for service.  Fajitas did not taste freshly prepared and the taco meat was dry.  All of it was luke warm.  Service was good however.  My parents liked their meal but they like any meal they don't have to pay for."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the area! I ordered the seafood soup and it was the best dish I have had here. Great service and don't forget to order a margarita."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Sitting at the bar is a great experience seeing the drinks and food being prepared. Staff is always friendly and answer questions. The cheese dip is nice way to start my meal. Enjoy so many different items from the menu. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Just okay, really basic Mexicsn place. Sister restaurant tonSi Señor in Westlake. Give you free chips and salsa which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant! I've been here several times. Service is impeccable- food is always HOT and flavorful- Staff is always friendly, welcoming and upbeat. I will continue to come!"}
{"text":"Good food,  fast service.  Its hot in here..."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican food. Having been taken there by coworkers many times, I've seen just about everything on the menu. My takeaway is they are better than average on the large items (burritos, fajitas, etc...), and they are worse than most places on the sides. Their rice looks like they mixed canned vegetables with it, and their salsa is nearly tomato soup. That being said, I've always liked the main item I ordered and have left satisfied. BTW...don't ask for sour cream; they charge $1 for a dollap. :("}
{"text":"If there is one thing you can count on from Mexican restaurants is that they're normally consistent. Consistent from restaurant to restaurant and most taste the same... Okay. Fiesta Jalapeños is significantly better than the average Mexican joint. The place is spacious with a nice bar area and the staff is very polite.

Don't waste your time anywhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican-american eats! I'd go back if I was in the neighborhood.

Salsa was good however the chips were over done so they were less golden and more brown.  Mango margaritas had a punch to them but were a smidgen too tart for my taste buds, should have stuck with plain or strawberry.  Our entries can out piping hot and tasty.  The chimicangas were especially delicious with their braised beef inside.

Service was relatively fast and prices were on point with other Mexican restaurants in the area as well.  

The only thing I didn't like was the atmosphere that was a little bland as well as being very loud on a Friday-nite since the space is just one giant room."}
{"text":"North Ridgeville is small and not many options in the city to go out and eat, we tried Fiesta's a few times but they failed to meet good quality food.
This place is extremely overrated"}
{"text":"Really disappointing! The place has changed ownership since we ate there last and the food is not near as good. The salsa had some weird seasoning in it, the burrito sauce tasted nothing like it should & the tortilla soup was bland. This restaurant used to be one of our favorite places to eat in Medina. Adios Fiesta Jalapeno, it was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"By far our favorite authentic Mexican food in town! We love their margaritas, food and service! The food comes to your table freaky fast and the prices are great."}
{"text":"We held a corporate event and Fiesta Jalapeños provided an excellent Mexican food option. They delivered at an late hour which was very convenient. I will use them again."}
{"text":"Very popular neighborhood place. Good food/ drinks and staff! Great place for a quick bite or a party!"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic each time I've been there, the food is phenomenal! The only complaint I have is the dining area I don't like the open type room. The bar area is fantastic. Other than my one issue this place is top notch one of the best Mexican places I've been to."}
{"text":"Fiesta Jalapeños is my favorite Mexican restaurant and I've been a patron for years. The complimentary chips and salsa are great, the margaritas are out of this world, and the food is always hot and fresh. 

When I go with family or friends, we usually start off with the tamale appetizer.  It comes with a creamy, spicy sauce that does not accompany an a la carte tamal. I love the enchiladas with the mole sauce, the chimichangas, the special fajitas...it's all good.  I've never had dessert here, so I can't speak to that, and my only complaint would be that sometimes the shredded beef can be a little dry.  It gets crazy busy in the evenings and on the weekends, so don't be surprised if there's a wait! I highly recommend Fiesta's. Don't forget to stop and have a chat with Lupe at the bar; he's the best!"}
{"text":"Great new location with the same great food!  FJ moved further east down Center Ridge into the Pat Catan's plaza.

Their new location is maybe a tad bit bigger than the old one, but the bar is a huge improvement. Lots more room!

I go here for Taco Tuesday lunch with coworkers occasionally and it's fantastic! Service is freaky quick and efficient and everyone is friendly.  The salsa bar that they have just for Taco Tuesday is great! Taco Tuesday tacos are now $1.25 each. Choose from chicken, ground beef, shredded beef, Al Pastor, carnitas, steak, chorizo, Tilapia, or seafood with a soft or hard shell.(Seafood tacos are $1.99) Previously $.99 at the old location, but there's now a taco toppings bar that includes Pico de gallo, assorted salsas, tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro, and sour cream.

Stop in and you'll get a quick lunch and leave with a full belly!"}
