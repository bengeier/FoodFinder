{"text":"Horrible service, food is decent at best but overall service sucks. Promised delivery to be 45 minutes and ended up more than double the time. Gave them another shot and they failed again. Would not recommend this place for anyone. The fact that I live down the street from them and they take the almost 2hours to deliver is outrageous. Customer service doesn't exist in this place. Stay away."}

As we returned to our hotel room one Saturday night in Vegas to freshen up to go out and gamble, we thought we'd save some time and order up some pizza so it would be there after showers and primping. The day before, we found a flyer stuck to our room door for Top This Pizza and we figured we'd utilize the good coupon deals they were offering. I called the establishment several times, but the call didn't go through (tried on cells and the landline in the room) so I placed the order online. They called about fifteen minutes later to confirm the order. Then an hour and a half goes by.  I figured ok, it's Saturday night at 11pm in Vegas. Understandable. Finally, the delivery man calls my cell and says he's downstairs at the valet and would I come down there to pick up the pizza. I asked him why he wasn't coming up to the room and he informed me that they did not deliver to the rooms, even though they called previously to confirm the order and the room number.  I was pretty surprised, and as I was still trying to get ready to go out for the night, I sent another one of our party down with some cash to pick it up.  Several minutes later he called again asking where I was. I reminded him that I sent someone down and described the person collecting the pizza. He called twice more in a matter of minutes, becoming ruder and ruder as I assured him that our friend was indeed down at the valet looking for him, and had been for several minutes.  We asked again why we paid a $6 delivery charge if they refuse to deliver the pizza to the room to which he replied, \"We don't like to deliver to that location.\"  We then told him to shove the pizza up his butt and went downstairs to Johnny Rockets instead.  Glad I was paying cash! Save yourself some aggravation and do NOT order from these clowns."}
{"text":"Pizza was very hard as was the bread.  Cheesecake was good. Took one an hour and we are only a few blocks over."}
{"text":"I just picked up an order. I think the health department needs to be called. Just saw a huge roach crawling up the wall over the deep fryer. I didn't even know what to do. I'm afraid to eat what I bought."}
{"text":"Would not reccomend this place at all. They advertise pizza by the slice but apparently don't have it ready. They open at 10 am but I went in at noon and asked for pizza and they said they just turned on the oven and it would be 15 minutes. I came back in 20 minutes and there was noone around. I waited 5 minutes and left. I came back at 1245 and asked again and was told it would be another 15 to 20 minutes. The only reason I kept trying was I was doing laundry next door. I woukdnt reccomed it at all."}
{"text":"Fukin amazing pizza. The crust is crispy and danke. Only bad thing was they ran out of 2 liters and gave me 4 cans instead. Wtf?!"}
{"text":"Pizza is not a complicated thing to make, and despite their best efforts, Top This Pizza seems to miss the mark. Ordered a 16\" with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers for delivery. When it got here I was amazed at how little cheese was on it, which sure to the lack of made the rest of the toppings dry out pretty badly, and since mushrooms start out pretty dry to begin with, not having a protective layer of cheese makes them almost inedible. The sauce was decent, so I give them credit on that part, but it wasn't applied fully to the edges of the pie which made some slices inconsistently crusty-er than others. I will probably not be ordering from this spot again, I don't feel that the quality of the food is justifiable with their pricing (my pizza with delivery charge came out to about $25) as I can get better quality pizza for 2/3rds the price almost anywhere."}
{"text":"2 stars only because the pizza was good. WORST delivery driver EVER. He should be fired. Called me to ask where he was supposed to deliver and i was like what the heck i gave you guys the address and he said he has the address but he's not gonna drive around trying to find the hotel. Are you serious? He had the most unpleasant attitude and demeanor when he finally arrived. Oh and before that, someone calls me from the restaurant asking me for my credit card number. I was like,  uh i am not giving you that since i ordered through grubhub. The guy on the other line figured out he was calling the wrong person and apologized but i mean still...calling a cuatomer for their credit card number is just funny business. I'll pass on this place next time I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger pizza sounds great on paper but turned out to be nothing like as advertised...there is actually plasticky american cheese thrown on top, not mozzarella and cheddar. In addition, the bucket of fries was not a bucket...just a container filled with mooshy, greasy, cardbord things instead. To top it off, the cheesecake advertised as new york style is a chicago style cake that is pre packaged. Worst food ever....and all lies on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great specials all the time. UNLV students get a 10% discount also!"}
{"text":"These guys are assholes and the place is filthy.  I'd rather eat frozen Ellio's out of the box"}
{"text":"If your hungry this is the place to order from! Barbara is so nice at the pizza place and the food is great i don't know what the previous post was talking about.. I think I might have to make this a routine stop every time I'm in vegas! =)

The website above is not correct.. www.topthispizzalv.com  enjoy everyone =)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Rude people on the phone. Delivered the wrong pizza. Still tipped the driver $5 on a $15 pizza. Quoted 45-1hr. Got here in 1.5 hours. Did not apologize. Did not deliver to the elevator even when they asked my tower and room number. Made me come to the valet. Bad experience. 

Lost the phone number for the best 24 hour pizza on the strip so if someone could recommend something, hollaaa at yo girl. 

And since I should talk about food...pizza tastes like the pizza they give you in elementary school. Cheese = rubber

Good thing: they gave me some cheese and pepper. Cool.

*edit: some properties don't allow for the delivery guy to come up. They could've told me this."}
{"text":"I love the insanity here, but I'm a bit biased. The food is always great and we try to try new things whenever possible.  Pizzas made any way you want them.  Tons of other options."}
{"text":"Took an hour and 15 minutes to deliver.  Forgot a topping on my pizza.  Sauce is terrible, tastes old and cheap.  The whole pizza seems cheap to be honest.  

Wings don't even have any sauce.  Mild is just a dry butter sauce here I guess?!?  Terrible, just tastes like a normal chicken wing.  

Would never recommend or order again."}
{"text":"Not that great overall service and place to eat, pizza was alright while hot...i also enjoy a cold slice of pizza just as much a hot slice. Next morning was like biting into shoe sole. 

ordered a order of garlic knots, what i got was deep fried dough with no garlic flavor or parmessan cheese.  When have they started deep frying garlic bread? i prefer oven baked cover with garlic and parmessan cheese all over.

Not sure if I'll go back, i would say no but never say never."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what they offer and upon picking up the food the place definitely needed a thorough cleaning."}
{"text":"Ok, so Eat24Hours gave this a lot of stars, but the food is just terrible.  Though the service was excellent!  I got cheesy garlic bread and a pepperoni pizza.  Would NOT order again."}
{"text":"Went here because it was the only pizza place near by open late. Price was average and the food had no flavor. 711's pizza tastes better and is a lot quicker which is pretty sad."}
{"text":"Always awesome pizza, Try and stop on in every time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This has to be the most dirtiest place I ever seen! But I tried to look past that and enjoy a pizza while I was doing laundry...the sweaty woman behind the counter took forever to take our order kept telling me \"I'll be right with u\" but that took 10mins and she wasent even doing anything ..... Finally I ordered a simple cheese pizza she said it would take 10 mins so I waited 20 mins to make sure , when I walked back in to get my pizza they never even made it and asked me if I can wait 10 more mins!!!! I told them I'm out what a waste....so don't waste ur time there"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! It might not look like much, but the employees are friendly, service has always been pretty quick, and the pizza is decent for the price. The place is across the street from the UNLV campus, the pizza is cheap, and so it's ideal for a student on a budget."}
{"text":"When we were staying at Tahiti Village in Las Vegas, we found this pizza flyer on our door knob. We assumed that the Tahiti Village management would be supporting this advertisement. So we ordered 2 pizzas, which were not good. When this person delivered the pizza, we found out later that he overcharged us by $5.00. We called the management of  \"Top This Pizza\" and he promised us a free pizza coupon and that he would send it in the mail when we got back home. He never did and it's been over 1 month. I wish that Tahiti Village management would prohibit this pizza company from hanging flyers on peoples door knobs. The reason is - that this pizza is not good and they are unethical to overcharge when they deliver pizza. Please think about ordering from \"Top This Pizza.\" You'll regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza 
Good price
Me and my friends were hungry and made the order and they came by really fast
Wings maybe small but are packed with flavor"}
{"text":"Not sure how I got a pizza that was half thin crust and half thick crust that's a new one for me"}
{"text":"Despite the response posted by the business 6+ months after this terrible experience, I stand by my original review. The original, incorrect pizza was NOT gone when the delivery driver returned, as the response stated; in fact, I reviewed the emails exchanged between myself and the Customer Care department at Eat24 following this experience, and verified through those messages that there was more than half of the original pizza available to be returned after my very hungry roommate ate, as he had been instructed to do. Most importantly, the only real reason to dignify this absurd, overdue response to my original review is to respond to the claim that I'm attempting to hurt their business. When the incorrect $50 order was received, I asked to return the complete, untouched order and receive a refund. I was lied to and manipulated as the business tried every trick in the book not to correct the situation, finally being delivered the correct pizza FOUR HOURS after the order had been placed. Stating that they had gone 14 miles round trip to correct the error seems to be moot, as 1.) any business with even a modicum of customer service skills would have corrected their error without question from the start, and 2.) at no time did the reply address the fact that whomever was operating their shop that night had lied outright to both myself (the customer) and Eat24 (the business by whom they were represented during this comedy of errors).

Please note that Eat24 issued a full refund of the money spent on this order due to the fact that the Eat24 Customer Care Rep stated that all of his communication with this establishment had been exactly as I'd stated, as he was actually the person with whom the \"owner\" spoke that night. Eat24 also cited the fact that the business did not take reasonable steps to correct the issue when presented acceptable solutions. More than 6 months have passed; this situation should have been addressed at the time, when it was more than a \"he said, she said\" scenario. 

I proudly support local, especially family-owned, businesses, as I myself used to be part-owner of a small business that, after nearly 20 years in the family, was unable to compete with large corporations. I will not, however, blindly support a business that, when faced with a simple error, takes astronomical steps to avoid providing basic customer service and conflict resolution."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas! FAST room service! YUM X 10!"}
{"text":"I believe these poor reviews on Yelp had closed down this business. DO NOT BUY THEIR VOUCHER THEY ARE NO LONGER OPEN. 5/10/16"}
{"text":"First time in this joint. Pizza was well done. Pretty tasty and good size for what you paid for. The wings are amazing. Pretty tasty and full of flavor. Waiting time for the meals took around 15 minutes for 2 pizzas and 24 wings. The actual place was small and kinda unattractive. But food was great. Will recommend to try to locals and tourist."}
{"text":"My son & I ordered from here the other day; I asked if the marinara sauce was chunky. The man on the phone told me I do not know it is marinara sauce. Could he not go over, take a spoon & freaking look at it? He said, I can put our \"pizza sauce\" on your spaghetti...Um, no! I took the chance & it was not chunky but very bland! The ranch that came with the order of chicken fingers {which were pathetic measly pieces) my son ordered was in ghetto containers with tin foil for lids. What restaurant cannot afford lids? Top This Pizza will never be entering my house again!"}
{"text":"Absolutley Love this place. Great food and even better staff!!!!! Handsome owner too! :)"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I went on vacation with my friends last Thursday March 19. On March 20 we came back from the club we wanted wings and that was everyone in the house. When I first got on the phone with the people they asked for my credit card info. Not anything of what I wanted to eat but my card info. 2hours later (440) he came to the door saying that he got lost. Really you live here. He had those old time credit card machines where they slide the carbon paper in it. So that means they had everything from my card. When I looked the total was 55$. Seriously don't ever go there."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Vegas we needed to get some laundry done and ended up next door to this place. Feeling like pizza would be a good use of our down time, we popped in to Top This. The guy barely looked at us as he explained the menu and gave us the feeling that he could take or leave our business. He didn't have all of the toppings on the menu which is okay because the open cans he pulled out of the refrigerator didn't exactly inspire confidence. The restaurant was also filthy. Once our food arrived, I only ate one of my two slices as the sauce was overly seasoned and the pizza was super greasy. Was pizza really this bad at my colleges?"}
{"text":"Pizza is not good
Sauce taste stale
Restaurant appears dirty
No restroom available for the customers 
\"go to Dotty's, they will let you use theirs\"
Disregards for sanitation"}
{"text":"Terrible! I just had an order delivered from here and for the price it was horrible. I asked if it was grilled chicken on the salad and they told me It was but it was frozen. It was canned chicken with iceberg lettuce. It was not even Romaine for $6.99. I will not be ordering here again. I called and told them how I was disappointed and they could care less."}
