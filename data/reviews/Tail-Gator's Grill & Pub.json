{"text":"Ain't no doubt that Tail-Gator's is one of a kind cause the food and women up there will blow ya motherf**** mind!  This is the place in Twinsburg where it's at.  Gator's been around for awhile and this place is always hoppin.  Great drink specials and their burgers are straight up butter. I got the cravin right now.  See ya up there."}
{"text":"Tail Gators has now been turned into the new Rush Hour. Same menu just different specials and prices. Last time I went the waitress was also the bartender and there was only 1 cook so we had to wait 45 minutes for our food. I definately liked the decor in the bar. I would still pick the new rush hour over the old."}
{"text":"I used to spend a good portion of every Monday evening at Tail Gators.

Now, I'm no drunk.  I was just in a bowling league that would get together here for drinks and 75 cent tacos after our three games.

Sccchhhwwat? 75 cent tacos? Yep.

Tail Gators is known for their traditional bar food -- burgers, wings and the general standard fare.   They do a pretty good job at it.  The wings are great -- check out the dry Cajun -- and the burgers are good.  But on Mondays they go a little wild and bust out a serious Mexican deal.  That's right, 75 cent tacos.

Now, the tacos probably aren't THAT great.  But for 75 cents, they are unbeatable. They come loaded with beef, lettuce, tomato and cheese -- and they really don't skimp, I was impressed.  After powering through three or four -- you'll be full.

Anyway, the Tail Gators' experience isn't complete until you meet Chowda.  

Chowda is a short, loud, no bull sh&* bartender from Boston.  He brings the drinks cold, the food hot and the attitude if you deserve it.  He's everything that is right about Boston transplanted to Northeast Ohio.  Don't dare call him Chowder -- its Chowda and his license plate says so.

Tail Gators is a great place for a quick meal or a long drink.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This is a great place to unwind after work and share good times and good food with the friendly staff. It recently just got a big facelift, which makes it all the more welcoming!"}
{"text":"Ah good ol' tailgators! This is a neighborhood bar in tburg! Lots of regulars, bikers welcome and I have to say I am fan of their Friday night DJ. DJ B-low. They have Monday night jam nights...locals come into play...excellent drink specials $1.75 tall draft domestic beers .45 cent wings...usually shot specials. Thursday is ladies night with two free drinks for the ladies. Friday night is DJ B-low...drink specials vary but always a good time! Saturday is usually live bands. I suggest checking it out the next time you are in the area. The food is surprisingly good and very affordable."}
{"text":"The best neighborhood bar and grill. Good drink specials, great burgers and wings. The calzones are awesome (and huge). Very friendly staff, the wife and I felt at home right away."}
{"text":"Tail gators.. tail gaters.. whatever, just a gimmick. I sit down around 8pm, it seemed that they were running some kind of Ohio state b-ball special.  Because patrons either had been there a long time, or have super low tolerances.  I sat down at the corner of the bar. Open seats to the left and the right.  It took  10 minutes to be acknowledged (note: 2 bartenders, 10 to 11 people at the bar). Now it was probably 5 minute because I was particularly parched.  The general feeling was not friendly during the entire stay.  Felt like they tend to regulars.  I ordered the calzone.  For the price, this was a hell of a deal.  As far as taste it was better than the price.  I will not say the flavor was something great, but it was border line epic in size.  Service was average after they realized I was going to stay and get food.  Overall this is an ok place to get food but nothing special.  Plenty of room, and plenty of large good quality Tvs to watch.

Would I go there again... yeah but I would need a hankering for it.  Yah I said hankering.  Side note: sometimes they have live bands.
2.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"First let me say that it is now Rush Hour.  The Rush Hour located on Darrow that people reviewed up above, I am not sure is still open but since the pictures and phone number are still the same (Also the sign is still up only had a see through sign above that indicated Rush Hour) I will review on this page. Guessing I went in the middle of new ownership.

I walked in on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed.  They had a DJ playing music of Top 40's music.

Ordered the chicken wrap.  It was huge and came with fries (kind of defeat the purpose of a chicken wrap), the quality was good.

They had all couple of local micro beers on tap which I liked.

Overall if you in the area stop on by nothing fancy but good."}
