{"text":"New restaurant...interesting concept. The concept is amazing, I would love to have a potato-only restaurant. This place replaced a recently closed pizza and wings place, converted into famous potatoes. I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally decided to go. When first walking in, this place is completely empty. I didn't even know if there was anyone running the business, until the person from outside walked in. He looked a bit like the mascot himself, buff and bald. I first asked for a potato bun. He said that they were still in the oven and it would not be ready. Then I asked for mashed potatoes. He reached in the warmer with a 3rd pan full of mashed potatoes and scooped some in the bowl.  I don't know how long the mashed potatoes were previously made, and how long they have been sitting in the warmer. That part made me a bit nervous. I chose some toppings, looked like typical canned toppings, and then I was on my  merry way. I didn't have anything to eat all day so I thought the mashed potatoes were delicious. Excited about it, I decided to go back next day to try the baked potatoes so I could write a comprehensive yelp review. The next day, it was on a Friday, 6pm. I could see two workers busying around the counter so I walked in. Well, tried to. The doors were locked and although the business said that they delivered until 4 am, it was closed...at 6pm...on a friday night. I was confused at this point. Are they a breakfast only place? A lunch place? Why are they even open at midnight if they are not going to serve the dinner crew?   The only thing I can say that their mashed potatoes are delicious. I don't know about their hours though. Or any other food in the menu, hopefully they are open next time I visit."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Famous Potato through Grub Hub and I have to say we were pretty disappointed.  We had a 6 topping potato and 6 topping mashed potato bowl.  The potatoes tasted ok but the amount of toppings were really skimpy (MUCH skimpier than the spoonfuls shown in the video on their website).    The most disappointing part of the order was that we paid $3.00 for an order of croquettes which turned out to be exactly 6 tater tots with a little cheese sauce poured over them.  Really?  6 tater tots? HUGE ripoff for $3.00!!!"}
{"text":"They have clearly no ethics, and have no idea how to run a business. Sadly, they are wasting the huge opportunity of this amazing concept."}
{"text":"If ur only going to make fries and potatoes, they better be good. Unfortunately the fries were soggy and gross. I had a meatball on the side and it tasted like dog food. I couldnt even swallow it. I wish I never went. :( sorry wish I could say something better- maybe their baked potatoes are better"}
{"text":"Another failure in this location. The place is gone goodbye. CLOSED"}
{"text":"Cool concept, but not fully executed to its potential.  It is a baked potato/mashed potato bar where you choose all of your toppings.  The price was right, but the toppings didn't seem as fresh as they should or could be.  The staff had their friends/family in the restaurant and they were extremely loud...it was quite distracting being the only paying customer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We also ordered through GrubHub. We were also disappointed. Ordered 1 mashed potato bowl. The potatoes were pretty tasty (although bland even though I asked for butter and salt), but I ordered salsa as a topping and asked for it on the side if possible. I guess not since I got NONE. Not on the side, not mixed in. None. The \"meatball\" topping turned out to be nearly microscopic bits of extremely burnt ground beef. At least I hope that's what it was. It was crunchy and black. Croquettes were laughable. A handful of tater tots with oily cheese on top are not croquettes, people. Friend ordered a baked potato with toppings. She said the potato was just okay (meh), but there were hardly any toppings at all. I emailed them with a chance to make it right before giving a poor review. They never bothered to respond. Big mistake. We're a HUGE company and order out every day! So, I've told everyone at work to avoid them and am going ahead with the bad review. It's a shame. We were looking forward to some tasty taters! Stay away!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place and I was very pleased! I ordered through grub hub during lunch hours and my food arrived much sooner than expected, a huge plus in my book.  I ordered two different potatoes, and they were both delicious.  They were giant potatoes with plenty of toppings and tasted AMAZING.  I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I never take the time to review, but this place is BAD! Order was late and cold, not sure potatoes in bowl were not instant, and \"croquettes\" were tater tots with sauce!  Seriously not sure how they even opened!  They make me want to not trust Grub Hub!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.....I ordered the phone online I got the food on time but it was missing a lot of details and sides it's my first and last time ordering from famous potato"}
