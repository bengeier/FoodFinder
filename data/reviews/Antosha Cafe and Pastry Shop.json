{"text":"I would like to express the words of gratitude for the great experience I had with Antosha Cafe and Pastry Shop. This weekend I ordered a Smetannik cake  for my 2year old daughter and it was so delicious that all the guests finished it within 10 min.  I was pleased with the customer service of stuff and, particularly, Irina  the chef baker who not only accomodated our prompt overnight order but really put her soul and lots of artwork to make the cake look very presentable and birthday-like. I highly recommend it to everyone for your special occasions!  Thanks so much again!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pastry and very friendly stuff. Thanks a lot for providing such a high quality service and food!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite bakery in GTA. Very authentic, the cakes taste just as I remember in my childhood. Their variety is decent  and my advice would be to sample everything until you find the ones you like more than others. You will like all of them though. :) everyone is very helpful in the store, if you are allergic to nuts, ask for assistance. There are nuts in some of them. I have introduced many Canadian friends to this bakery and they are all loyal customers now and loving it :)"}
{"text":"I'm addicted now to all the pastries this cafe has. Vanilla cake is the most popular among our friends and only 30$. I don't understand why people are paying crazy money for cakes at pastry boutiques, because most of them are not tasty at all - too sweet or to oily. Antosha is Russian place with authentic NAPOLEON cake, not like everything we tried at Yammy market or Amadeus. Tiramisu is amazing as well and we buying cakes there each Saturday and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Just to keep it short - not worth it. My russian friend recommended me this place as 'one of the best', and I was very disappointed. I got a spinach pierogi and a slice of ptiche moloko, my friend got a slice of chocolate cake. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I am not a Canada native but whenever I am in Toronto this is my go to spot. This bakery is super authentic and has delicious pastries and desserts. My favorite is the Napoleon cake - Best Napleon I have had! Highly recommend this place. They have a great variety of sweets and coffees/teas. It's a great relaxing vibe with a European feel. A must visit!"}
{"text":"A Russian bakery with just some darn tasty cakes.  Be sure to try the amadus cake, yummy hazlenuts and cream."}
