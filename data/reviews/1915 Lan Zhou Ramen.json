{"text":"Personale giovane e sempre pronto a soddisfare ogni esigenza del cliente. Le 5 stelle sono per la qualità del cibo, fresco, preparato davanti al cliente e senza intingoli che molte volte i cuochi usano per mascherare cibo vecchio. Non servono alcolici. Te gratuito. Abbiamo preso 1 Ramen Vegetariano, veramente buono, equilibrato nei sapori ed aromi di verdure ben calibrati. Abbiamo anche preso il Ramen Hand-Pulled noodle with beef.....ottimo ma quello vegetariano è migliore. Entrambi costano cad 8,95.   Da provare assolutamente i Bean paste cakes cad 3,50.  Da vedere il ragazzo che prepara i noodles..... bravissimo, tipo stile spaghetteria Italiana.  Bravi!"}
{"text":"OMG if you want good Spicy ramen don't come here. It's so bland, and only the broth has flavour. However it tastes like chicken noodle soup broth. If you had high expectations for this don't. Might as well go to the neighbouring one. Really nice service and friendly employees. Would have gave it 5 stars for a better spicy ramen dish."}
{"text":"Best Hand Pulled Noodles I've EVER had. period. Freshly pulled per order. Broth is outstanding. Full of 5 spice and so much flavour. I get the Seafood bowl. Amazing. GO. EAT. then write a review on Yelp.Ca"}
{"text":"This place was decent but can't be compared with similar uptown joints like Magic Noodle, Big Beef Bowl, or Artisan Noodles. The beef slices were extremely tough and the broth lacked authentic flavour, very peppery and there was definitely msg present. If you order the original kind, it comes with beef balls but they taste like the kind you'd get at the hotpot section at T&T. The consistency of noodles was ok, nothing special - it only comes in one thickness level. We also ordered the tofu skewers which also tasted store-bought with minimal seasoning. Overall, very underwhelming and somewhat disappointing experience. But this place could have potential for something great if they fix a few things."}
{"text":"Terrific ramen and no lineup like at Sensotei Ramen. Terrific meals well under $10. Service was very helpful. Lots of slurping but I am OK with that."}
{"text":"Tried this handmade pulled raman, liked the noodle texture and the tasty soup base, the beef brisket topping is delicious. Service is fair, wait time and noodle prices are reasonable. The appetizers (cold dishes) are pricey, taste so so and the portion is small, not worth to try."}
{"text":"The texture of the noodle, the beef slides and condiments were all quite authentic.  Except it was quite salty.  Kids loved their meal."}
{"text":"My mom and saw that pulled noodles were offered here and couldn't resist trying it out. The place is pretty small so come early or be prepared to wait for a table.   When you first walk in, here's usually a guy creating pulled noodles, slapping the dough on the table and pulling and pulling until he has tons of strands of individual noodles. If you're waiting for a table, at least you have some entertainment.   I ordered the beef brisket pulled noodle. Lots of soft, tender pieces of beef brisket in a flavourful broth. The noodles were pretty ok - thin with a slightly chewy texture. My mom ordered the fried chicken pulled noodle. The chicken is fried and sliced on a separate plate so that it doesn't get soggy in the soup. Her broth wasn't flavourful at all - just bland. The chicken was alright - two thin thighs that are pounded flat and breaded. It's served with sweet chili sauce on the side.   We also ordered their \"secret spare ribs\". I don't know what \"secret\" there is but it was extremely underwhelming. The ribs itself had no flavour to them and the breading was slightly sweet. I couldn't figure out if that's how it's supposed to taste or not. I was expecting a more salty profile or some white pepper for a kick or flavour.   All in all, I probably won't be back. I prefer the pulled noodles from Sun's Kitchen in Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket noodles, the leek pancakes and buffalo wings.  The food was ok, maybe im spoiled by the scarborough/markham chinese food..the noodles were a good texture. The side dishes were kinda meh."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Toronto this past September and heard soooo much about the Ramen so we came here. We were seated immediately in the front of the store, it looked tiny but it stretches back pretty far and there are more tables in the back! We all don't eat pork so we ordered the vegetarian ramen with tofu. DELICIOUS is the only way to describe it. The portions are huge and this was probably the best broth I've ever had. Very flavorful and rich. I was especially amazed with the tofu.. it had the texture of beef and tasted incredible. No spongy taste that you usually get with tofu in broth. We were only in Toronto for a few days, but I definitely would have had lunch here every day if I could have. Must-have whenever I'm visiting!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese noodles, speedy service and nice waiters and waitresses. When I walked and settled, I got the menu. Less than five minutes after my order the two big bowels of noodles are ready.  I am also presented a pair of scissors to cut noodles if I need to. The foods are so delicious. My whole family enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I had my hopes high when I selected this place while on my way to the Eaton Centre.  I think I should have gone to the old Chinese restaurant on the nearby side street.  We ordered A01 and A02.  A01 was the hand pulled noodle with beef shank and beef ball.  It was weak.  It had a few slices of beef shank and a beef ball that was cut in half.  No veggies either.  The broth was okay but was not enough to overcome the lack of substance.  The other bowl of noodle we ordered was with beef brisket.  The brisket was dry and again the broth was just okay.  I should have trusted my gut and went into Chinatown for good eats."}
{"text":"It's not ramen... But that's okay.  Despite the misleading name (probably due to some chinglish translation) this place serves one of the most authentic hand pulled chinese noodles outside of Markham. Like most place in the area, seats are cozy and limited, service is quick and efficient, but quality hasn't wavered. The noodles and delicious and have the fresh traditional texture of hand pulled noodles. The broth is authentic, not too obnoxiously strong, and complements the noodles and desired topping. I ordered the bbq pork with my noodles: a fair portion of good quality cuts.   On a street full of cookie cutter ramen and bbt shops, this restaurant stands above the rest. Would go back again and would even line up for it."}
{"text":"100% handmade ramen,but small portion and little meat in bowl. Soup is not bad though.It was chicken ramen in th pic. Small and narrow store,but exsited reasonably at high-rental downtown core dundas strest."}
{"text":"I would comparable to GB Pulled Noodles with less of an insane line-up. There's also a guy in the front pulling fresh noodles and throwing them into the vat.  All noodle dishes, fried or soup, are $8.95. I like how they offer different meats as I am not a big fan of tendon. I had the beef brisket and it was nice and soft. Soup came out bubbling hot, there's a good amount of veggies and noodles were bouncy. Unlike GB, they don't offer different shapes/thicknesses of noodles. The noodles are like spaghetti.  They also have fresh soy milk, hot or cold, for only $1. It was refreshing, maybe a bit diluted for me."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the restaurant was UNBEARABLY hot, and the AC was just not powerful enough since their kitchen is in the middle of the dining area. The side dishes are very pricey, but the bowls of noodles are about average in price. The lamb and beef skewers were very good!  I will NOT be coming back until they fix the AC, or until winter kicks in."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. Place was boiling, limited AC.  Also it seems like a few staff doesn't speak English as they keep coming up to me in Mandarin and I didn't know what the heck they were saying. I had to point to what I want. The meat I got was all small chunks didn't even have a nice big piece like the picture.  Also not a lot of meat altogether.   Noodles were cooked well and amount is decent.  But overall a big disappointment.  I prefer Homemade Ramen to this place any day of the week. They have better soup base and the meat there is a lot better. Noodle is on par."}
{"text":"I have no idea why the rating is so low on yelp!  The hand pulled noodles are incredible - seriously masterfully created. You can watch them being made and it is mesmerizing. I got mine with beef brisket - lots of fatty pieces in a light but flavourful broth. I enjoyed this wayyyy more than ramen. Topped it off with chilli oil.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is quite good.  The decor is a more tradtional Asian style table with an open kitchen so you can watch the skillful chef pulling the ramen noodles from scratch.  The big plasma televsision showcasting the entire ramen noodle process was a really nice touch.    The place was really packed also, and constantly have customers in and out of the establishment.  The staffs are really friendly, and I think the boss gave us some mildly spiced radish as side dish for free.     The soup base was really tasty with a fragrant \"mai la\" flavours and my lips were a little bit numb in a nice way without msg.  I can tell because whenever I eat something with msg, I tend to drink a lot of water.  The deeped fried chicken wings with five spices and breaded with panko was was really good.  Finally, I ordered the home-made herbal jelly to finish off the meal, and it was really good with a slight bitter and sweet taste.  My only criticism was that the noodles on the bottom of my bowl kind of clumped together.  That's a big no-no for noodle lovers.  Hopefully, they can improve on this quickly.  I would definitely visit this place again if I am around the area craving for noodles since the soup base was so good.  Wonderful way to end the day!"}
{"text":"Just walking by on this cool morning and felt like some noodles. Was greeted by the noodle maker which was nice .   Service was good. No complaints there.   I ordered Beef brisket noodle. The broth was hot and tasty. The noodles were really good and I would say it's up there with some of the best handmade noodle places in the area.   The only issue for me was the quantity of the beef brisket. I had very small pieces of actual beef. My bowl was filled with 95% beef tendon. That was a big disappointment as I'm was ordering based on what the photo in the menu shows.   Overall I would come back again. I would be willing to try this dish again but really make an issue of the meat portion of I wasn't so pressed for time and hangry."}
{"text":"Lan Zhou serves great hand-pulled noodles with the perfect thickness, chewiness and texture--and gotta love the clear broth. Warning for those who are expecting a thicker, richer broth: this is chinese ramen, not japanese ramen!  I've tried a couple of different noodle bowls here--duck, pork, chicken. The duck was by far the best, the pork+soy marinated egg was really good, and the only one that didn't quite meet my standards  was the chicken. At $8.95 each though, these were all very reasonably priced and of decent quality. The sides are a bit more pricey but the noodles are always given in generous portions and I always leave full. Would come back for the beef or duck!  Service is alright, the place isn't usually too busy so we're always seated right away and we get our food  real fast. Have to wave the waiters over for water/ tea and the bill, but when you do they come quick."}
{"text":"I really like hand pulled noodles so this was a must visit place for me. Note this is not a Japanese ramen place. I've had hand pulled noodles at two other place before and this place was the best. I had their roasted duck ramen. The broth was clear and the noodles were perfect in texture and savoury. The table had vinegar and hot oil if you want to add some sour or hot taste. Both my friend and I were still hungry after. Maybe because the broth is not fatty like pork bone base for ramen. We finished noodles but didn't drink the soup. Good if you are not super hungry! They also have free wifi, password beside the washroom at the back."}
{"text":"Nothing much to say about the place itself. It's found near University and Yonge where a lot of Chinese restaurants are located.   I've never tried Chinese ramen until I came here. The broth is clear and reminds me more of a pho broth. It was really good--not salty like regular ramen and just the right amount of flavour. I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles (avid noodle lover here). Of course there's a chili oil on the table that you can add for some spice. I would say the price was very reasonable for what you get compared to other restaurants around the area (~$8-10 per bowl).  Overall if you want a light soup noodle meal, come try these noodle bowls!"}
{"text":"I really didn't like the taste of the noodles I literally only ate half the bowl and it was only because I was starving. The overwhelmkng taste of cumin made the noodles unpalatable.  Also tried their onion pancakes and was disappointed with how little onions there were."}
{"text":"This is a good ramen place to visit on a cold day. The portions are very reasonable and the soup and noodles taste great.  I ordered the pock hock noodles ($8.95) with a side of chicken giblets ($3.5) and special fried pork ribs ($5.50).  The soup base reminds me of a pho soup base and came with veggies and meat. The giblets were spicy and crunchy. The special pork ribs were delicious! It was deep fried and had a distinct minor sweet taste to it.  Def. curbed my craving for hot noodles! The service was good and quick."}
{"text":"Tried this place a year ago but decided to visit again because GB handpulled noodles was full and a huge line was waiting outside.  It's a medium sized restaurant (compared to the places nearby), but they only have one washroom.  Service is pretty good, with lemon water refills frequently.  The menu consists for a variety of handpulled noodle bowls to choose from, and if you're not interested in noodle soup you can get some other items like fried noodles or something. But if you're here for the noodle soup, you're getting a bowl of noodles for $9. Portions are not bad either. Downside is there isn't much room for customization, so you can't choose the thickness of the noodles for example.  I ordered the LU WEI bowl because it was interesting to see that offered on the menu. And also because I had a sample of LU WEI from a new taiwanese restaurant just last week so I wanted to see how it compares.  The noodles were pretty good. Not too thick, not too thin. I do prefer chewy noodles but not overly thick, so that was a plus. The garnishes provide a lot of flavour for the broth. As for the LU WEI broth was...it was alright I guess. The flavor wasn't as strong as I was hoping, but it does have a nice flavor to it. They add in about 5 different toppings including pork tongue and pork belly to give more variety to the flavour. The pork bellies were thin and small slices, but they had flavor.  Despite the shortcomings, I think $9 for a bowl of handpulled noodles is still worth it, given the options in the area."}
{"text":"I have  been waiting for this place to open on the Dundas st. w. strip or Toronto's \"Little Tokyo\".  The restaurant serves hand made/hand-pulled noodles in Lan Zhou style, served in a delicious clear beef bone broth.  You can choose from several toppings such as braised beef brisket (that's what I ordered), roasted duck, BBQ pork, chicken filet, pork slices for $8.50.  There were others on the menu, but don't remember at the moment.  The menu also has quite a selection of small side dishes for $3.10 and other appetizers for a bit more.  It's decent value for lunch in this area, considering most restaurants charge in the $10 plus range.   The noodles were cooked a bit too soft for my liking, it was lacking the slight chewiness that I sought after.  However, the braised beef brisket was excellent.  It was soft and not sinewy and well flavoured.  The beef bone broth was also good, wasn't too salty, not fatty and didn't taste like there was any MSG (a good indicator is if I'll become thirsty within the first 30 mins of eating).  I could taste the spices that was used to infuse the broth.   The layout of the restaurants tables are small and cramped in the restaurant, so don't come here with large groups, since it would be difficult to accommodate tables of more than 6 people at a time.  If you come alone, you'll most likely have to share a table with strangers.  The staff was also welcoming and were quick to serve."}
{"text":"I don't know whether to give this place a two star or a three. The food was quite delicious, but also quite dirty. You could see that they had a kettle on the floor to boil water... and not to mention my table saw a cockroach running along the floor that same night.  I had ordered the salt and pepper calamari ($5.75) and  the bean paste pastry cake ($4?). Both of which were not extraordinary. I've had better. HOWEVER, their main attractions are their hand pulled noodles and I ordered their beef brisket noodles with soup ($9.99?). They have an option where you can choose the type of noodles that it comes with and you can also request for extra meat or extra noodles for a small surcharge (probably around $2-3 for each upsize).  The soup base was quite clear and light and the beef was tender. The noodles I ordered were the mid-flat ones, and honestly, they're to die for! One of the best noodle textures I've ever had in my life!!!  To be honest, I don't know if I can turn a blind eye to the dirty atmosphere (I mean we're in Canada, not Hong Kong). I would love to come here again...if it were cleaner! Overall, great food, but dirty place....."}
{"text":"We wanted something a little different than typical ramen joints you can find throughout the downtown core, so we tried this brand new place. Lan Zhou Ramen is a hand pulled noodle place with a variety of different noodle soups. We had the A01 beef noodle soup and the A02 lamb noodle soup, along with the jellyfish and secret ribs appetizers. Both noodle soups, being hand pulled noodles, were very springy and chewy which was definitely a plus. They used the same broth which is just right (not too salty). With a nice assortment of meats and vegetables (include bok choi and pickled daikon), it was a delicious noodle soup I wanted more of! Adding the freshly made and aromatic hot oil and you have a match made in heaven.  The appetizers were also fantastic! The jellyfish was served with pickled vegetables which was a nice complement, while the ribs had a memorable savourness  to it. I would definitely recommend both.  After the meal, the waiter even asked us if the soup wasn't too salty! I really respect asking for our opinion so they can improve in the future! Overall, a very good experience for something a little different."}
{"text":"This place is definitely under rated. It's super authentic. They make the noodles fresh to order for each person right in front of you. It's actually way better than he place next door that has 4 stars. It's doesn't look all modern but the food quality is 5 star."}
{"text":"This is one of the few good Chinese hand pulled noodles in Toronto. The texture is spot on, and I like the ability to have extra noodles if you're running very hungry.   The side dishes in general are pretty good. However, I would have preferred the broth to be stronger. All-in-all, it's a great little place."}
{"text":"Inexpensive but it shows...  Ordered the beef brisket noodles...  Barely any beef and the bok choy looked like the left over leafs and 2 slivers of that to boot.  I had more tendons than beef but for 8.95 what do you expect?  Soup was decent but hand pulled noodles had a consistency and taste of instant noodles (I saw the guy pulling noodles so maybe it was just for show).  Heading into Chinatown next time ...no more detours because I did not want to walk further or wait for a table at a busier restaurant."}
{"text":"Lan Zhou Ramen recently opened up in the former space of Eat Fresh Be Healthy.  Not to be mistaken for Japanese Ramen, this place serves hand pulled Chinese noodles.  The restaurant's clean and the layout is similar to the previous restaurant that occupied this space.  The temperature's a bit warm but understandable given the presence of the kitchen right in the main room.  Food-wise, their offerings are similar to other Lan Zhou noodle places.  I had their main dish, the regular beef noodle soup.  The broth had a subdued taste and wasn't overly salty.  There's chili oil on the table if you want to spice it up.  There were also slices of beef and daikon, along with some Chinese vegetables.    We also had some appetizers - namely their cucumber and pig ears.  They were both OK.    Price-wise, the appetizers were $3 each and the noodles are around $8.50+.  Service was good and water was filled regularly."}
{"text":"The taste was not bad but I feel there were too much noodles too little veggies. Not looked like the pictures."}
{"text":"Very flavorful soup :) great seaweed salad too. The only problem is the selection, and slightly pricer than noodles in Chinatown. Overall great though!"}
{"text":"After finding myself at Lan Zhou Ramen more times than I can count thanks to my YEA being quite the fan, I can say that I'm starting to become a fan.  Here are my tips after many meals at Lan Zhou:  1. It's always busy so expect a line and to wait a little bit.  2. Always get the extra soup because it's free and the broth is pretty hearty and warming on a cold wintery night.  3. When you have to choose noodle sizes, the mid-flat or mid-round is the best choice. It holds up well whilst floating in the soup and won't go soggy quickly like the silk or regular noodle thickness.  4. I have never figured out how to really incorporate eating the long unbroken noodles with the hot chili oil at the table. The soup noodles don't really need it though.  5. Always get the extra noodle because it's easy to slurp up that long unbroken strand and suddenly find out you got no more.   Lan Zhou has quickly established itself against the competition with their hand-pulled noodles along side the ramen and pho shops along the University-Dundas strip. They don't offer a vast range of soup noodle options but they do each of them well.  Don't need to worry about the decor or the spaciousness of the location, just focus on that steamy bowl of broth when it arrives at your table."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of dishes: Hand-Pulled Noodle with Braised Beef Brisket tasted really good. The broth was sweet and spicy, the noodles' chewiness was perfect and the brisket was tendered. My only issue was that the bowl was huge, so there were too much broth covering everything. This did not represent what you see on the menu, which is in a smaller bowl with enough broth without covering the noodle and meat. I've also ordered pan-fried dumplings, which weren't juicy enough inside (I got use to homemade dumplings which are much juicier), and a plate of Enoki beef roll, which lacks some taste."}
{"text":"Service was good, the noodles had a nice texture but I found the broth extremely salty.  Ordered the beef brisket.  Found the chunks of meat a bit small."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are big foodies. We've tried quite a lot of ramen places around the city but this one blew our minds. I usually can't finish the whole bowl but this was too good not too.   We got 2 drinks  An appetizer  And two BIG bowls of soup. Hand pulled noodles, amazing duck and sausage all for under 30!   Fast service and TOO GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews. This place is great. It's quick and easy. The noodles are so fresh and made in front of you! Love the broth- full of flavor and not too salty."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this visit. Literally surprised, because we only came here after we found out our original ramen choice was temporarily closed.  Note that this is not Japanese ramen. The best thing about this place is the portion sizes relative to the price. I ended up quite full, which isn't always the case for me at ramen places (without ordering extra noodles). This place seems to have gotten a bad rap on Yelp, so far, and is rated lower than I would rate it. What I didn't care for was the service. It wasn't bad, per se, but I was feeling particularly thirsty on this visit after maneuvering about the busy city of Toronto. And I know it is ramen, and you typically shouldn't really require much service, but management was also sitting right next to us going over the dealings of restaurant operations, and it made me feel uncomfortable. It was extremely bustling, and just not an enjoyable atmosphere. It WAS clean, at least.  But, the ramen did impress. The menu is quite robust for a ramen shop, as well. I went with the duck, and my girlfriend got the barbecue pork. They both used the same broth, and it complemented both just fine and dandy.  I encourage you to at least give it a shot and see who you agree with more: me, or the majority of other Yelpers. You're entitled to your own opinion, but if you don't like it here, your opinion is wrong."}
{"text":"The most authentic LanZhou Ramen I've had here!! Don't know about their other Ramen but the Lanzhou Ramen made me burst into tears!! The soup is clear and flavourful, the Ramen is the right consistency, and the beef is sooooo tender. Will definitely come back! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give them a 2 star because what they offer is a bargain for this area but what we have here is a mediocre bowl of Chinese Ramen. Admittedly, the noodles are actually pretty nice with the distinctive chewiness and crispness only hand pulled noodles can \"pull off\". However, everything from the soup that lacks flavour to the tough to chew beef brisket really drags this place down."}
{"text":"For me, this is the best Lan Zhou ramen in Toronto.  It reminds me of magic noodle when they first open.  Soup is tasty and portion is big.  Price is under $9 for a big bowl of hearty noodle that neighbouring stores cannot beat.  Staffs are extremely friendly and the store owner is super nice.  I heard the table beside me got the wrong noodle and the owner just gave them an extra bowl free of charge.  Free wifi and they accept credit card.  If you love spicy, make sure you add the chilli sauce!"}
{"text":"I would not come back here. Ramen is mediocre, I got the braised beef and didn't get much meat, I also ordered the Chinese pancakes which are hard, the \"secret ribs\" is just salted batter, barely meat on them.  Just the worst, I'd never go back."}
{"text":"Was craving ramen so we decided to try this place last week. The noodles are very well made, they taste like soba noodles with a pretty raw flour taste to it. The chicken broth was not very strong, everything sort of has this mild raw flour to it. The craft of the hand pulled noodles is a 5 star, but the taste is just okay. Maybe it isn't suited to my pallet. The fried chicken is great (Dark meat only). I wouldn't recommend this place all that much. All day after I ate it, i felt sick. You can tell the chicken is of low quality, the broth lacks flavour and was a little fishy. I wouldn't try this place esp since there are two stores on either side of it that look better!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese ramen place. Calling it ramen I suppose is a bit misleading because people tend to associate that with Japanese ramen, but whatever.  The food's decent and reasonably priced, making this place a winner in my books.  The more popular items here would be the beef, brisket, or duck noodles I'd reckon. They also have a luwei noodle, and grilled chicken or veggie noodles for those who don't want the red meat. I'd say for a noodle shop you have a decent enough variety on the menu to have most dietary preferences covered, so kudos to them. My companions also tried the dumplings and lamb kebabs and enjoyed them quite a bit.  It's interesting when you get to watch them hand-pull the noodles, which is a part of the whole experience. The noodles are cooked quite nicely with a distinctive flavour and texture. Personally, I'd prefer if there was just a little bit more elasticity/firmness to the noodles, but no biggie. The broth is also quite flavourful as well (but I'm not sure what exactly it's made with as they don't seem to identify the stock used).  It's a well priced meal and the serving sizes are quite decent for what you're paying. Service is efficient and friendly enough; the servers we had all spoke English just fine. The restaurant is rather tight as you might expect for this area and they've done their best to fit as much seating as they reasonably could in here. If you're seated near the front of the restaurant, be prepared to have to deal with the noise of the person slapping the noodle dough all over the place. Even though it's the winter, the restaurant was very warm and rather stuffy inside, making me question how (un)comfortable it could potentially be in the summer."}
{"text":"Popped in with my 3-year old daughter after a visit to the AGO to escape the cold weather and grab some lunch. As soon as you enter, there's an older gentleman pulling noodles - so neat to watch. We ordered the brisket ramen to share and a scallion pancake. The soup took about 2 minutes to get to our table after ordering! The broth was so delicious - not too salty or fatty, but with lots of flavour. The noodles had great texture. The only downside (and the reason for the missing star) is that the brisket was very very fatty and chewy. We ended up sticking with the noodles and broth, which more than satisfied. The scallion pancake was also quite good, especially dipped in a mix of the vinegar and chili oil. Our meal cost less than $15 with a soda (for me), which I found to be great value. Worth a visit, especially if the Japanese ramen place down the block has a line!"}
{"text":"Not being a ramen expert I was ready for anything.  The dumplings and beef skewer apps were good not great.  My ramen, a01, broth was good but I defy anyone to tell the difference between the noodles in the soup and actual spaghetti because that's what they looked like and that's what they tasted like.  Perhaps there are better dishes on this menu but if you like ramen you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had and Calamari was perfect. Not chewy at all. Homemade Noodles put it over the top. If I return to Toronto I definitely will stop by again"}
{"text":"Hand pulled Chinese Lai mein.  Quite a bit of space and in the heart of the Japanese crazed area on Dundas between Bay/University.  Service: Good, quick and efficient. The food came out in a normal amount of time and they are always pouring tea (free of charge) or water when you're low.   Food: Noodles were decent. They only came in one size but it was pretty good (could have been slightly more al denté), but for the price $8.95 + tax, it was a good bowl of noodles. I ordered the braised beef and I was very happy with the pieces given. It was fairly skinny but with the enough fat for me to enjoy immensely! We also ordered a plate of green onion pancake, $3-3.50 (I forget the price). It was a big let down in taste and size. There was barely any green onion inside and i felt like I was only eating fried dough. You can definitely skip the pancakes at this place.  Overall, it was decent. I'd go back if Sansotei (next door) queued up again like it did the Friday night when I went.   Nice and spontaneous place to check out on a whim!"}
{"text":"They make their own noodles here. Great fun to watch. I enjoyed it but not so great that I want to come back over and over again. It's a much higher quality of Chinese food than the rest on Dundas.   Don't let ramen name fool you. It's la mien."}
{"text":"This is NOT Japanese ramen. I repeat, this is NOT Japanese ramen. That being said, this little joint has some pretty good hand-pulled Chinese noodles. My boyfriend and I were originally on the hunt for some good ol' Japanese ramen, so we were heading to Sansotei - only to find out that specific location was closed for renovations. Needless to say, it was getting late, and we were starvin' marvins.   Hence our little trek to find another suitable place to satisfy our ramen cravings. This is where Lan Zhou comes in. It's only a few doors down from Sansotei, which originally made me wonder about the competition. But as the first sentence states, there really won't be any competition, since it's two different types of cuisine.   We were a bit skeptical at first about this place being any good because it's new, and the few reviews on here weren't exactly stellar. But never fear, this place is actually pretty good. It was way better than my expectations.  The texture of the noodles were on point, and the portion sizes were plentiful - especially for the price. I ended up with the BBQ pork version, while my boyfriend had the duck version. We both enjoyed the food quite a bit. It actually was reminiscent of the food I have had in China, which means this place is pretty legit.  The broth appeared to be the same in both our noodle dishes, so I assume they don't change it, even with different topping options. I don't mind, but some other people may, especially if you have dietary restrictions. The BBQ pork was good, as was the duck. So no complaints there. It's definitely comparable to a lot of the Chinatown places I've had in the US.  My only gripes about the place are that it was a bit warm in the restaurant, and the water cups are tiny. They had to refill our cups quite a few times (because we were thirsty and it was hot), and then they wouldn't check back for some time. Thus, we sat with empty cups for a good portion of the time we were there. And the water was room temperature, which didn't bode well, since it was so hot.   It is a bit on the tiny side, but since we came at a later time in the evening, we didn't have problems with seating. Though I imagine that it can probably get crowded pretty quickly at peak times.   This place is still new, so I'm sure they're working out the kinks. I'd definitely encourage anyone who isn't sure about this place to try it out. It may just surprise you.  Overall: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 2/5"}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Authentic pulled noodles experience. I like the side dishes too and the self made soy milk drinks"}
{"text":"Good Chinese la mian noodles in a tasty broth. The beef brisket is more tender than the normal beef lamian, but I suppose that was expected. The noodles were soft and thin, not thick enough to be chewy so don't come expecting that! The portion size is big and you probably won't be hungry after!  The 'secret ribs' consisted of deep fried...  short ribs. We weren't impressed and they were quite pricey for the small plate (6 pieces).  It was unbearably hot where we sat. Probably a combination of the fact that the kitchen is open, and that the air conditioning could only reach a few tables meant that we just wanted to go as soon as possible. Hot noodles/soup + hot store = not a fun experience."}
{"text":"I did not like it at all :/  Asked for a vegetal ramen that took a long time to come, the taste of the soup was like egg water and the noodles wasn't that good either.   The place itself is super clean but noisy, maybe I choose a bad day to go there but either way I don't think I would feel comfortable if I went any other day"}
{"text":"The ramen was pretty good.  I needed somewhere to eat lunch and somehow I ended up being here.   I usually just end up getting the beef brisket noodles and I wasn't disappointed.   Amazingly good ramen for a good price.   I will come back again."}
{"text":"Very accommodating for a large group although some members of my party had issues with their orders (too cold broth). My ramen was decent. I ordered the duck ramen. Broth flavourful with not that much other veggies and stuff in it. Really enjoyed the noodles. Definitely can taste the freshness. Price comparable to similar places. I would come back."}
{"text":"Although I am not a huge fan of Lanzhou style Ramen, I did grow up in China- and have had fair amount of encounters with Lanzhou Ramen.  I have to say their stuff is very authentic, for better or worse, it is how it supposed to taste. For those who complain about the broth being clear: you are not supposed to drink the clear soup of Chinese Raman in general- if you want to drink the soup, get out and find Japanese Raman instead."}
{"text":"If you want some soupy noodles but had already eaten pho and ramen sooo many times in Toronto, this is a great place to try.  Noodles are hand pulled. You can see (and hear) the guy slamming the dough while you eat. Beef broth is clear and has a good beefy taste (could be stronger though). You can choose from a selection of meats, hock (I believe), brisket, duck, chicken. I tried both hock and brisket and I personally like the brisket best but my fiancée leaned towards the hock.  I tried the leek and egg pancake and surprise ribs as sides. It's good I guess but nothing really special. I'll stick to the noodles next time."}
{"text":"I've only had the opportunity to sample hand-pulled noodles at a small food-court stall in the infamous Pacific Mall, so I got excited when I heard that there was a place right in downtown Toronto offering the same.  We arrived at Lan Zhou Ramen around lunchtime on a Saturday and the place was packed. Luckily there was one squished table near the front available, so we pounced.  A quick perusal of the menu led me directly to an item that I always eat when I go to the aforementioned Pacific Mall eatery. (I can't accurately describe it since Lan Zhou doesn't have a webpage, but it was noodles with ground pork and cucumber.)  It's delicious. The pork and cucumbers are well-prepared and tasty, while the noodles are dense without being chewy. It's immediately clear that these noodles are a cut above similar fare in most other joints, and I certainly can't argue with the price point of $8.95. (The portion was a little too small for me, however.)  We also started with some kind of appetizer involving mushrooms wrapped up in beef and it was good too, if a little simplistic. (The first thing I said to my dining companion after taking a bite was that it sure does taste like meat and mushrooms.)"}
{"text":"I am so glad to have a good hand-pull Chinese Ramen place near me now. The noodle is pretty authentic to my taste. The chewiness of the noodle is just right, and the ingredients all taste fresh.   The soup is supposed to taste lighter authentically. If you like the thick Japanese ramen soups and was hoping for something similar, note that these are two completely different types of noodle dishes.   The service is great even when they get quite busy during dinner hours. I can definitely see myself being a regular here."}
{"text":"terrible service. they tried to manage the seatings without caring about where the customers like or dislike to seat. it is extremly unprofessional?and when you try to argue with them all you get is unpatient ignorance. i have never being mistreated as a customer before. as for the food, not really as good as i had back in china. how the heck would people use sugar in chinese ramen??"}
{"text":"Got the classic beef noodle, tastes pretty authentic! Visited there on a Saturday during lunch, it was really really busy. The customers were a good mix of all people."}
