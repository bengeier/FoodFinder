{"text":"I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great!   I ordered General Tso's Chicken, a small Pork Lo Mein, and the fried dumplings. I thought I was in for a treat as I don't often get the chance to have chinese food. Little did I know, that the food about to be delivered from Taste of China @ 5415B Monona Dr, Monona, WI was horrible.  The chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible.  The next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good value for your money.  I had the cashew chicken lunch special. The lunch specials are reasonably priced and come with massive amounts of food.  Each lunch special includes a cup of hot and sour OR egg drop soup, 2 fried wontons, 1 egg roll and your entree served with steamed rice.  Since I'm a big fan of wor won ton soup and am always looking for the best out there, I also ordered that to give it a try.  Like a previous review, I found the won ton soup to be very fresh and satisfying and it was probably my favorite part of the meal.  The hot and sour soup was also good; it didn't seem hot at first, but as I continued eating it, I could taste a little bit of heat kicking in.  Because there was so much food, I didn't eat the fried won tons or the egg roll.  The cashew chicken was a tad salty, but mix it with the steamed rice and you're good to go.  A solid \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Found this place on BlogTO.com and since my wife and I are new to Toronto, thought we would give it a go. Glad we did! Order the dinner for two, plus shrimp rolls, free delivery! Yes it took a while, but we guessed it might, so no big deal. Will keep these guys menu and order again."}
{"text":"This place is as good as the last time I was here, over 8 years ago. The owners, chefs and waiters are the same people, which is phenomenal, considering most Chinese restaurants nowadays change within a matter of weeks.  One of our fave dishes is the pig intestine with vinegar veg. Sounds gross, I know, but I swear it's delicious! Literally everywhere else I've ever ordered this dish does not make it as good as this place.   Try the salt and pepper egg tofu with broccoli and enoki mushrooms...so yummy!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and put the call out to Twitter and Facebook for the best Chinese delivery in the College / Spadina neighbourhood.  The most popular restaurant, hands down,  was The Taste of China.  This place did not disappoint.  We ordered General Tao, crispy beef,  honey garlic ribs and noodles with beef.  Everything had a unique flavour and as always, tasted even better when everything gets mashed together into a heap of Chinese amazingness on your plate.  This is my future staple and I can't wait to try something here that blows me away and increased the rating to five stars."}
{"text":"Let's see if I can finish the his review before they bring us the cheque. The restaurant is your typical Chinatown restaurant with just the right amount of kitch and 80s decor.  The service was good, although not overtly friendly, but then again it is not something I expectedin a place like this.  The food was mediocre at best. Unmemorable, flavourless mush. Even the vegetable spring rolls were cold on the inside. The fact that they still serve shark fin soup in this day and age blows my mind.  Walk a block up or down and actually have a memorable meal, instead of one I won't remember by the time I wake up in the morning.  Cheque is here, gotta go...."}
{"text":"Fantastic, love number 102 , snow pea leaves with garlic.. and try a hotpot or szilling plate. Good value and fast service."}
{"text":"This is my go to Canadian-Chinese place for delivery when I'm downtown toronto. My order arrived in literally 30 minutes it was pretty fresh, tasty, and still scorching hot :-)   I ordered too much food lol but I don't regret it at all. The portion sizes are very generous!! The shrimp with lobster sauce on rice was massive and pretty flavorful. The chicken wings, and honey spare ribs were great :D I've never had spare ribs and I really enjoyed them!! They had hardly any fat (thankfully) and they fell off the bone.   I was a little disappointed in the Szechwan vegetables though. They were bland and not a single tingle of spice. I wouldn't order that again.   Overall if your looking for fast, fresh Chinese food it's definitely worth a try :-)"}
{"text":"Have been a good loyal customer until today.  Cold food delivered and when I called they yelled at me saying I should pick up my food if I want it warm.  What is the point of offering delivery?"}
{"text":"Taste China (as their sign says) is our stand-by for Chinese. Programmed into our cell phone and it is ready by the time we drive by on our way home."}
{"text":"I can visit this place again and again for their yummy Chicken and shrimp Wonton Soup! Totally love it!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and the food was horrible! the orange chicken and beef broccoli tasted as if it has been sitting over night. The worst part is when I called and politely asked for a refund, the owner refused to believe the food was not fresh, and said it wasn't \"any of his business\". I will never go back and eat at this place. WORST CHINESE FOOD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Taste of China for the first time upon the recommendation of a foodie friend. I went for a late lunch, and the restaurant was not particularly busy. The one waiter on staff was very friendly and service was prompt.   The menu is huge - with over 150 different items to choose from, it was hard to decide what to eat. My group was small, so we ordered a couple meat dishes, some noodles and some veggies. The food came to the table as it was ready, hot and steamy. Presented beautifully, everything tasted fresh and flavourful. The standout dish of the meal was the stir fried snow pea leaves, which were cooked to perfection (stems still a bit crunchy, but the leaves wilted just so) in a healthy amount of garlic.   The decor is nothing special - but it is clean and simple. Yes, there are plastic bag tablecloths, but they melt into the rest of crisp decor. I'll definitely be going back and eating the lobster - which was served at the next table over. It looked fantastic."}
{"text":"If you're looking for takeout Chinese in the area, this place is awesome!!! They deliver, and by deliver I mean.. they are at your door with hot, yummy food in minutes...they will tell you 30-45 min and will be knocking in 15!! As for the food, we have been coming here for takeout for the last year, and have yet to get anything less that delish. They are very inexpensive, have good food and are fast! What else do you need when it comes to takeout Chinese."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I tried the Sweet And Sour Pork lunch special. The rice supposed to be \"Fried rice\" but it was just your run of the mill Uncle Bens style brown rice that had zero flavor.   The pork itself was tough and chewy. The sauce for the pork was bland.  The combo came with an egg roll, which was soggy and had a weird flavor to it."}
{"text":"The food is made pretty well, however some dishes can be misleading.  Scallops with anything is not what you think, well at least with take out, (which makes it even worse if you think about it), they gave us probably 3 scallops sliced quite thin...just stick to what you are good at and what you can sell with pride...why have a bad reputation for the sake of having that menu item?"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner for bigger groups like 6 to 12 so you can have a round table with lots of good food to share. Love the crab with fried rice in a bamboo steamer. Service is a bit rude but efficient. May need to wait for a table  place is busy. One of the better places in Dundas Spadina Chinatown."}
{"text":"I love this take away, always Deliver in good time, great friendly staff, they even sometimes know my address wheni call!, this is now my new regular Chinese takeaway,  Once I didn't have enough to buy enough for a free delivery, they said it was ok that time and they still gave me my free delivery. Top take away! I use them time and time again. Great tasting food, wide range on menu. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I feel like I've had much better.  The food was unfortunately bland (all of us found we had to request hot sauce, and I do not usually do that).  The shrimp balls were delicious, though.  Hard to go wrong with fried seafood!  The lobster was tasty, and it's always nice to be able to splurge on something like that, but again, rather bland.  For post-bar greasy Chinese food, though, this place can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Went on a date with my gf two days ago. She ordered schezuan shrimp and I got a chicken cashew with steamed rice. Chicken was okay, shrimps were tasteless. Customer service was horrible.."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout last night (New Year's Eve) and the food was as you would expect it to be - typical mainstream Chinese food. Delivery took about 70ish minutes, not terrible given the date. However, we had leftovers today and found a huge insect in our food (see picture). I have reported them to Dinesafe. If it wasn't for the bug, I would have given them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food and open until 5am!  How can you not give them 4 stars?"}
{"text":"This second time I've gotten take. They arrived within time given. Food not order correct. Potstickers yummy! Will order again"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people are saying that is bland?  hmmm well here is what my family always order:   Pork fried rice - love the taste and the pork season is just right.  Chicken low mein - kids love the noodles... they could cut the chicken pieces just a tad more so its not so huge for my kids.  Shrimp with vegetables - always consistent and flavorful for me.   sometimes I add egg drop soup to the mix but at times consistency isn't always there. But I still like it.   Fried shrimp- could use a little less batter mix.   I like the taste and customer service and quick cooking time for my to go orders.   I like to add siracha sauce to my meal and its great. Price is just fine for the food! owner is always pleasant and so are the kids that work there. Big supporter of this restaurant and will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Ok, I eat here A LOT... and for years they have never failed me in making some really, really good food.  I am closing in on 300 meals from this place.  I do quite a lot of take out and in 5-10 min its ready to go!  As of late I've been killing the Lettuce Wraps!!!!  Holy goodness!  Ummmm...   Some of my Favs are Spicy Korean chicken w/brown rice,  Stir Fired Chicken w/ xtra chicken and xtra egg!  Ummmm...  Working out and want to eat clean...  their teriyaki chicken over steamed brown rice is super!  The chicken is prepared very nicely!   All in all, you can count on some good food at a good price.  I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Took an hour to deliver 4 miles and the food was barely edible. I ate a little of everything (because I was so dang hungry) and am now just hoping I don't get food poisoning from the few bites I took.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I probably ordered delivery twice a month! Same order as usual: Supreme fried rice, general tao chicken and eggplant with tofu. Sometimes i'll add the odd item, but it never fails to fulfill my craving for Chinese food. If you spend over $30 its free delivery. The folks there are very kind, from their servers to their delivery man. Give your tastebuds a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I had to keep asking for my order. The waiter snatched the menu from my hand. Mind you I was going to order something else but decided not too. Food is great, but I'm not going to pay for bad customer service"}
{"text":"Good food at good prices - best part about this place is the lady that runs the show over there - her name is Misty. Ask fo her and you won't leave unsatisfied. They should definitely pay her more."}
{"text":"This is our current provider of Chinese delivery food to the Entertainment district But after issues with the last several orders we will start looking for another. List below 1 one hour delivery when usual is 30 Minutes 2 send wrong dish but did replace within 30minutes 3 quality and quantity of the good stuff in Chop Suey is diminishing 4 recent breaded shrimp yield tiny shrimp in a huge dough ball But We have never had a dish from them that made us ill. So try it but, we are now looking for another provider"}
{"text":"My spouse and I have been regulars here for years. There's a reason. It seriously has the most consistent food quality and efficient service of Chinese restaurants in this neighbourhood. It's our spot."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick evening in meal! Delivery is crazy fast and the food is great! Favorite is the crab puffs, the pupu platter and lettuce wraps......I am an appetizer person since I can never make my mind up but have also had a couple of main dishes and everything has been great! My husband had been on a search for a new place since we moved to Gilbert and found this place and now it's our go to which is a lot to say because he is so picky! He enjoys anything spicy they have and always gets their spicy soup. It's not expensive so what do you have to lose......try it out it may become your new we don't know what to do for dinner fav place!"}
{"text":"We'll figure I would update my review.  Taste of China is a great place to bring kids even on a Friday night.   The orange chicken is very tasty and the white rice compliments it nicely.  I recommend dining in and ordering a Pepsi.  The soda is nice way to wash down your meal.  For the money the food and service is excellent, the secret is to Dine In for the best experience!"}
{"text":"food was nasty and cold. egg roll was hot outside but still frozen inside. overall a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Do the takeout/delivery, don't eat in.   Been getting their delivery for years, good food for a good price.  The two times I have gone in for sit down dinner the service was lousy.  First time the staff was slow to take our order, but evetually got our food.  The second time we were seated by what passed for a hostess, and after ten minutes sitting in an empty restaurant with the hostess ignoring us and no service we finally got up and left."}
{"text":"What a marvellous experience at Taste of China!   My partner and I just moved to the area and we were looking for fast, cheap and tasty Chinese food, this is task more difficult than you would expect given the sheer number of Chinese eateries in a 2 kilometre radius around our new flat. In attempt to narrow our options I took to the Google to find a decent place. Now I wasn't expecting much, I did say we were looking for cheap food, but I hoped for something yummy.  The ordering experience over the phone was ok, we ordered the dinner for 2 (C1) it came with spring rolls, general Tao chicken, chicken fried rice and beef with veggies. In what felt like minutes (ok maybe it was like 20-30min but it was hella quick) the food arrived. The delivery guy was friendly and efficient. He was armed with one of those credit/debit machines (I prefer this option to reading my card number to a random stranger over the phone) The food was hot, fresh and smelled yummy.   We decided to dig in right away! The portions were plentiful. Which was surprising since we only paid $30 bucks. They used good quality ingredients and tons of fresh veggies, big chucks of meat and very little grease. There was so much food that we had three meals out of it. Pretty good value if you ask me.   Bottom line-if you're looking for tasty, hot, fresh and affordable Chinese food in China Town you could do a lot worst than this place. We will be back!!   Happy eating ;)"}
{"text":"Well friendly service and delicious food. These guys sure take care of their regulars , thumbs up for the taste of china !"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We ordered, Lo Mein, Mongolian beef, and Sesame Chicken. The food was meh -- no better than stale food from under a heat lamp at a cheap Chinese buffet restaurant. I expected better."}
{"text":"Only ONE thing keeping this little hole in the wall fantastic place from getting 5 stars is the fact that meals are served as they are prepared (which is very very quickly I will add)  my wife didn't get her meal until after mine.  they do not serve a whole table at once like a normal restaurant.  The food MORE than compensated for this little error in processing!  go here!  you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Late night run for congee on a bitter cold night did not disappoint. Truly the best HK style congee I've ever had, with perfect consistency, light flavor and an  abundance of fresh, plump shrimp and scallops.  Additional balancing flavors of shredded ginger and dried scallop added flavor and texture, and went perfect with a dash of white pepper and red vinegar.  The decor is decent and the restaurant clean and well maintained. Apparently known for fresh seafood dishes, you know you're in a good place when famed chef Alvin Leung is dining at an adjacent table and not yelling at anyone."}
{"text":"Take out was fast, wonton soup was very good and the crab Ragoons were perfect."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times now. Service has always been good and fast. Food is excellent as well."}
{"text":"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.  Ordered delivery tonight and first off after waiting for an hour and fifteen minutes I call to check the status of my order, the man on the phone said 15 minutes - i waited 25 and then called again and he said 2 minutes and hung up the phone on me. Yet the driver did not arrive for another 15 minutes. That is a total of nearly 2 hours. My normal place (which was closed tonight so I had to order from here) is normally there within 40 minutes - and a lot cheaper.  After receiving the food it was warm, not hot, and a huge disappointment. General Tao is supposed to be crispy, this was soggy. Sweet and sour pork was bland and soggy as well - as were all the veggies in the cantonese chow mein and the house special rice was also very bland.   Needless to say, it definately deserves the 1 star it gets- the food was awful and for more expensive prices than I normally pay. I would not reccomend it nor will I be returning."}
{"text":"bleh.....tasteless chowmein, tough meat, tasteless eggrolls.....DON'T BOTHER  EDIT: 30 minutes later....my toes and fingers are swelling......they use MSG!  Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Great choice.  Love the wonton soup with noodles!  Perfect option for Chinese delivery"}
{"text":"What the hell is wrong with people. This place is awesome. Every dish I've had has been satisfying and plentiful. Prices are low, food is flavorful, and made to order. This place beats ripoff PF Chang's any time. I'm not so sure why they have bad reviews. Never had a bad experience. They're very nice people who run an excellent family business."}
{"text":"Great food. I left Canada 12 years ago and came back to Toronto this year and the first place I came to eat at was here. Food taste the same and excellent as usual. Would highly recommend this place if you're looking for great and real Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is good. I'm obsessed with their pot stickers. However the customer service is terrible! We've never had our meal there for that reason. When we come in to pick up the girl is always sitting there with friends and the first thing out of her mouth is \"sigh, will you be eating here? Sigh\" and her friends just walk through the kitchen as they please. That can't be sanitary. We've been so displeased with the service we aren't going back."}
{"text":"The food is generally delicious.  Quick delivery service. This is very subjective. Depends on how close to the restaurant. Food is still warm in a good quality wrapped.   They gave us free Crispy Crab Rangoon due to purchase over $20.  The order taker talks politely and the delivery man is also friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant wasIntroduced by my friends. The food of the restaurant is more authentic Chinese food. I was born in China, so always miss Chinese food. Environment also give me the feeling of the Chinese restaurant, for the noodles of the restaurant, I feel very good , noodles are very flexible."}
{"text":"Just got delivery from here. Delivery was okay didn't take too long. However, the food is very bland and flavorless as all the previous reviewers mentioned (I should have listened). I got the chicken lettuce wraps. It had no sauce for flavor just tasted like a rancid chicken. I did not eat. I got dumplings and crab puffs which were both okay but I would not order again. Crab puffs had a sour taste to them. And I also got soup. I tasted a very little bit and will not be eating. Needless to say I'm super bummed, hungry, and will not be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch because I was impressed by the reviews in the window -- despite the fact that there wasn't a single customer in the restaurant. Mistake. Clearly this is another one of those places that put all their effort into dinner and cheap out on lunch.  General Tso's chicken was too bready, overdone, and smelled of old oil. And was served with fried rice. Blechh.  I'm not ruling out dinner here - especially the seafood that the Globe and Mail raved about - but lunch? Never again."}
{"text":"I really hope this is not what China tastes like...  There are corporate chains that have better food, and THEY are horrible...   You can tell the ingredients are of the lowest quality and cost the owner the absolute least amount....  Plain and simple, just another \"don't care about quality\" place in a busy strip mall...."}
{"text":"Sat at home with the Bank Holiday Monday blues I thought I would take advantage of the glossy menu I had shoved through my letterbox the previous week. Promoting free delivery for orders over £12 within a 3 mile radius and open all Bank Holidays I ordered a range of appetisers so I could pick and choose. I ordered two types of spare rib - one in salt and pepper and one in a honey sauce. What I got was two containers of cartlidge in tasteless gloop. My other dishes of spring rolls, sesame toast and seaweed were acceptable. When I rang in my order the person on the other end was incredibly efficient and delivery time was prompt. I reserve full judgement on this as I did not have a main course but if ever I were hankering for ribs again I would not come here."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had yet moving to Arizona. The fried rice wasn't the best but the lemon chicken was great! Delivery was fast via Grubhub."}
{"text":"We love this place! Yummy food. the orange chicken and the amazing chicken are very good. They also have a brown rice option upon request which is important to me."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here has declined over the past couple of years. On a few occasions, the food has made me sick.  More importantly, though, I was deliberately overcharged on my last visit, and when I asked about the discrepancy, was lied to. They said that the total they were charging me was correct. From what I can tell, they're rounding up totals.  The bad food made me wary; cheating sealed the deal: I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Reliable, not overly cornstarched cantonese food which is getting harder to find on spadina. They also have daily soup, and a selection of braised stone pot rice items with fish, lamb, Chinese sausage. I have gotten takeout and eaten in the restaurant and both were a-ok. The only downside is that it doesn't have appetizer platters and if you're feeling like barbecue pork or duck then you'll at least have to order a half of one, and a full serving of jellyfish."}
{"text":"I don't eat Chinese food regularly but my son asked for it so I obliged. I ordered delivery through Door Dash. The only bummer about that is Door Dash does t give you the full menu to order from...anyway, this is very good Chinese food!  We love the General Tao's chicken and the Szechuan chicken.  The steamed dumplings were solid as well.  Good value."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery.  Once it arrived I went to take the food from the driver.  He grabbed the receipt I'd signed,  as I had paid the woman with credit card on the phone,  and proceeded to demand I tip him. I was taken aback. As he was almost yelling at me in very broken English that I had to tip him. I said I had paid the delivery fee and the lady on the phone said that was for him.  He wouldn't give us the food and it was so uncomfortable. I had paid ovee the phone as we had no small cash on hand and they don't do debit.  I ended up finding him some loose change and even then he was pissed.  Holy.  So rude. I wish I'd given him nothing. Didn't help everything was spilt everywhere in the bag once he handed it over."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had Hong Kong style crab, Shrimp fried rice, deep fried spicy garlic shrimp, crab and sweet corn soup and garlic Bok choy. The servers were helpful with suggestions, the service was quick, presentation was simple but nice. Everything was delicious. They serve complimentary tea to start and Orange slices to finish. Nice touch :)"}
{"text":"We came from Boston for the long weekend. The original plan was to go to Dayali, but we changed the plan due to the concern of time.  I honestly don't know how can a restaurant like this make to the top ten list here. The Cha-shu pork taste worse than the frozen Cha-shu I get from HongKong supermarket. And Fried Seafood with salted pepper is an absolute NO.   GG styled chicken is alright l give it a 5/10 just to be nice :)   Oh and there is this cringe \"wikie talkie\" guy sitting next to us absolute like ruined our lunch."}
{"text":"The good? So, I have to admit two out of four dishes we pretty good. Best chickens wings ever.  The bad? Where do I start. We got this corn soup that was basically egg drop with a can of corn. Not so good. The seafood dish was bland and not spicy like I ordered. However the worst was the service. I am writing this review as I am waiting for our waitress to come over so we can get out check. She and all the other servers are rude and basically ignore you. Even when they bring a dish over they do it while turning their face away then leave. We have been waiting for over 30 minutes for our server. She hasn't asked how our food is or anything. But she has had time to look at pictures from someone's cell phone and replace silverware and dishes. Worst service ever!!!!! There are so many other restaurants on the street please try a different one."}
{"text":"Been to Taste of China twice in 3 days, that itself should be a testament of my addiction. One for a lunch with 10 people and the second time at 2 am.  1st visit Highlights: - Peking duck two course meal - the first choice is ok, but the second meal which consists of duck and lettuce wraps is AMAAZING! I could eat the whole thing myself.  - wonton soup - delicious  - general tsao chicken - spicy and yummy - soft shell deep fried crab - the best part of the meal, by far - xo sauce chicken noodles - these were delicious too   2nd visit highlights: - soft shell crab again ..of course!   I would highly recommend. Service is great and they recognized me the second time around which was amazing. Even at 2 am, it was packed. Open till 4am, so if you're feeling Chinese food at 4am, I recommend Taste of China!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price.  The delivery area covers a wide area. We love it!"}
{"text":"This is the second time they've gotten our order wrong and when I called to let them know, they wanted me to pour out my food to look for miniscule pieces of orange to prove it was not orange chicken but the general tsao that we ordered instead of just saying, I'm sorry, let me send the right dish out to you. No. Just send the right item. They also said a manager would call back and they never did. They don't label the containers so if the dishes look identical (tsao chicken is a little bit lighter, they said), and taste identical, we have no other reason to believe they are identical. Don't argue with me because your dishes look and taste identical and your containers are not labeled.  Learn from this experience instead of trying to prove me wrong, and fix your process."}
{"text":"The best General Tao chicken in the city... and seriously I know, my roommate and I have had an ongoing feud over this for years. Taste of China vs. Swatow (across the street).   Now I will give Swatow credit for delicious wanton soup BUT Taste of China rules in the General Tao department, theirs is crispy, spicy and a little sweet and doesn't taste like it's cooked in OJ concentrate - burn Swatow*  Taste of China is also superior in ambiance. Years ago this place was a dive but it's obvious that it was recently redone and is now clean and well cared for. The service is always friendly and helpful, they deliver AND they're open until 4 in the morning on weekends."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch delivery. They falsely advertise their pricing for delivery on their website. And when this was pointed out, the driver laughed and said \"it's company policy\" and then when I called, the lady on the end of the phone also didn't seem to care and said \"well, the price changed.\" I advised that their website still showed 1.49 for the delivery fee, I was charged $2 and she said \"It's only 50 cents.\" .Yes, it is only 50 cents. So why not just suck it up for customer service and charge me the price advertised? It's the principle of it. On top of it, I was charged a $1 card service fee which of course wasn't mentioned when she asked \"cash or card?\" and I told her card. No resolution. No customer service. The food was actually pretty good. Too bad their customer service didn't match."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Taste of China since moving to Gilbert in 1999, and I have never been disappointed, whether eating in or ordering out. Service is great, food is great, and prices are affordable. Two must-try dishes are the House Chicken and Orange Chicken"}
{"text":"This is the fastest and freshest delivery in the valley. I ordered from Taste of China on my way to the corner  7-11 for some Pepsi and the delivery and I arrived home at the same time. Love the Orange chicken but just about everything other than the BBQ pork is worth a try."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes - the sizzling chilli chicken is new to us and didn't disappoint. Place is nice and the staff were really pleasant but we came during downtime around 2:30 pm. Thanks to reviews and photos on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food delivery I've had yet! I order from here regularly and have never had an issue with anything. The food is scorching hot when I get it and delivery is a lot faster than any other place I've tried. The teriyaki is delicious, as are their lo mein noodles!"}
{"text":"Tasty food for a late night (for us old fogies anyway, 11:30pm lol...) pit stop.  Food is always quick to arrive, although the main dishes came out before we got our steamed rice.  The Servers are attentive.  We had half a crispy chicken (one of our faves), beef with black bean sauce, lots of beef in the dish.  I also ordered the sizzling fish (Sizzling chilli fish), it was okay, it came on a hot plate with veggies, the fish was breaded though and a bit soggy.  Our bill was $48, just average I guess.  I will come back here though, mostly because I know what to expect.  Oh and a major plus; the washroom is on the main floor! :)"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is not 5 stars but the hot sour soup is the best I have ever had and kiddo loves the honey chicken!!! Delivery is fast and food is always hot when it arrives"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!   Food is always good and consistent! Another Plus is they deliver in downtown! Something not on menu is chow main noodles stir-fried with soy sauce with beef. We always order this, Their Sesame chicken is awesome its fried chicken strips stuffed with shrimp paste. Our go to!"}
{"text":"Ordered twice from this shop, delivery both times. I want to like it, but I can't help but feel like their chicken was frozen? Something about the texture and the dryness was certainly off. I'm no picky eater, But there was certainly something funky about that batch of orange chicken.  twice."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take-out in Gilbert! We've tried quite a few but none as good as this one! Customer service is always great every time!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They always forget part of the order. Gave them another chance and it was a huge mistake."}
{"text":"Just don't. We have been up and down with this place for years, it's so close to our house. Never again!"}
{"text":"I think we were ordered the wrong stuff.    I keep reading about how Toronto chefs eat here and I wanted to know what the hype was all about.    I will order actual dishes next time, not just noodles and congee.  They were okay, but I still want to know why this place has got the WOW factor.    Until next time..."}
{"text":"If you're not into 80's, early 90's furniture and decor meets China town, this place is NOT for you.  If you have a problem with employees wearing white beaters and serving you food, this place is NOT for you.  If you're into lunch specials (choice of soup, eggroll, and crab ragoons, and entree dish) for close to $6, this place IS for you.  Good prices, decent food. A bit on the bland side for the veggies, but  good use of spices throughout the meats and soups. Good service but would appreciate it if she wasn't wearing a tank top and serving food.  Let's up this to a 3.5."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night feast. We did not order well. None of my friends wanted to get seafood so I ended up getting the crispy beef. Everything was edible but nothing struck me as really memorable. I will try to go back and get some of the house specialities."}
{"text":"Not at all how the pics look! Chicken egg foo young comes in a box? With no sauce or gravy and the patty itself was so dry! Fried rice was so plain and no flavor with a drop of peas & carrots. Lo mein chicken noodles were stuck together, NEVER again so so dry! Where is the sauce? I also got beef broc which was ok but I won't be returning. Oh and $30 order no egg rolls included !"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic, and if I had the option to tip the cook directly I would.  I took my old friend visiting from Montreal here for dinner last month to get a taste of China (pun intended).  It seems very similar to the majority of the Chinese food restaurants in the area.    We waited a slightly above average amount of time for the food to arrive, but that was no problem.  I presume that was the chef making sure the food was extra delicious, which it was!   The shortfall of this restaurant is the cold service.  We were waited on by a middle aged man and a middle aged woman.  Both would barely make eye contact, or acknowledge our presence.  When our orders came, they put them on the table and just walked away.  We didn't even get a chance to thank them!  Anyway, where I'm from you at least smile for a tip.  It's not assumed that people will tip you just for delivering their food.  All in all, aside from the service, the food was delectable. I indeed recommend the taste."}
{"text":"Wish i could put no stars, ordered the orange chicken and honey chicken, and  chicken chow mien with egg-roll. First they must never read their reviews, because the EGG ROLL tastes like a cinnamon spray paint can. The orange chicken and honey chicken are the same thing and VERY VERY bland. I used to order lunch from here all the time and loved it, I don't know what happened. I am now ordering from GRACE GARDEN for my Chinese food needs, I hope they don't disappoint either, they were great the first time and I was going to order again, but I hesitated, because Taste of China used to be my favorite and my dedication for food stays true."}
{"text":"One thing I've noticed from most of these reviews is that none of them actually review the restaurant's specialty: seafood.  As you approach the entrance to the restaurant, you'll see a sign with nothing but Chinese writing on it. One of the sides is actually the double-lobster special menu, where you can get double lobsters and 2-5 other non-premium entrees. The 2-entree selection is $43, a wonderful price. Normally, double lobsters cost $35, and each non-premium entree is $10-13.  I had the double lobster cooked ginger and green onion style, steamed tilapia, and veal. This was the best Chinese-style lobster I've had in Toronto, far better than the nearby Rol Jui restaurant and the Pearl Court restaurant in East Chinatown.. The entrees were wonderful as well.  So why haven't any of the reviewers on this site noticed this? It's because this menu doesn't have an English translation, nor is it on the main menu. When I asked about this, the waiter said they only wanted to reward regular customers, and that \"white people\" don't eat seafood often anyway! I was flabbergasted at this response.  Get rid of the xenophobic attitude and I'll give this 5 stars. It really is a great restaurant, but you must order seafood to fully realize the restaurant's ability. Demand to order from the Chinese double-lobster menu and have the server translate if necessary."}
{"text":"The delivery is insanely fast!  And the food is delicious!  My daughter loves the chicken lo mein and I really like the General Tso's chicken and the crab puffs."}
{"text":"The tall Asian man who stands near the door to greet and take patrons orders- is very rude to minorities.   I kindly asked him if they sold \"shrimp lo mein\" he replied with a really unprofessional and condescending comment.  The food was not all that great and it was not \"Shrimp Lo Mein\"!!!!!  I was very displeased with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery on a Sunday night because our usual delivery place was closed. Food-wise, it's very hard to judge. We ordered a very white-people selection of dishes: Shrimp Spring Rolls, Sliced Szechuan Beef, House Fried Rice and Canotnese Chow Mein.  Spring Rolls were very small for the price, but crunchy and tasty without being greasy.  Szechuan Beef was okay. Lots of veggies and the beef was very tender but I'm not sure what was Szechuan about this dish. There were no peppercorns and absolutely no heat.  Cantonese Chow Mein was just ok as well. Noodles were all soft (I like the crispy ones at the edge).  House Fried Rice was really nice. Crunchy green peas and chunks of shrimp, chicken and pork.  Overall, the veggies in each dish were kind of overcooked and mushy, but what I REALLLY liked was the fact that none of the dishes were oily or greasy. At first I thought the food was sort of bland, but in the end I appreciated the lack of grease that was left on my plate and in my system.  I'm leaving room to try this place for dine in and hopefully add a star or two on."}
{"text":"After a late night outing with friends this was probably some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. We ordered a variety of dishes and the plates were licked clean by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Food is just OK.. Doesn't stand out, wasn't terrible.  The website doesn't appear to have been updated in years as the prices are not at all accurate.  Delivery driver does not carry an extra menu.. asked twice after the surprising price I paid calling in ordering off of their website menu.  Done with this place.. there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Been going there since they opened and never had a,bad meal.Love their egg rolls, egg fu yong, lo mein, boneless spare ribs,orange chicken. Nice little family restaurant!"}
{"text":"I can't review the food because we only stayed for a bit.  We were not impressed.  The decor is tacky and the restaurant was not clean.  I could see remnants of food on the walls.  The biggest most disgusting thing for me was that the menus were sticky.  We decided to leave.  There was one other couple there.  Hopefully, they fared better."}
{"text":"Not the greatest. We picked this place for Saturday night delivery after reading that it was #2 on blog to's \"best Chinese delivery\" list. We ordered dinner combo for two which comes with 2 spring rolls, sliced beef, general Tao chicken, fried rice and spring rolls. Everything was pretty bland aside from the chicken... Which actually was very good! Probably wouldn't order from here again though."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! I usually go and dine in, the place could use a little upgrading but it doesn't take away from how great the food tastes! I've had delivery twice now and both times they have gotten there faster than what the approximate time has said. If you are looking for that yummy Friday/Saturday night Chinese take-out, this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm definitely no Chinese food expert (please don't take away my tribe membership) but I think that this is my favourite spot to get downtown chinatown delivery; say, for example, on Chinese Food and Movie day. Pretty fresh seafood and all kinds of tasty dishes.   Apparently I'm not the only person who has heard of this place and a quick google search and conversation indicate that it's a favourite late night spot for some local Toronto chefs, as well as a couple of my dear friends."}
{"text":"This is your average Chinese food establishment.  I'm a fan of sweet crab rangoons and they serve the savory ones here, but I will not fault them for that.  What I will fault them for though is rude customer service when picking up orders (delivery men have been nice) and the prices seem to be $1-2 high for every item on the menu."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaazing!!! I am so glad I found this place a few years back :) the food is so fresh and delicious! The best clean chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. I actually order just a large steamed chicken to have on hand so I can add it to my other food! We are probably one of the most difficult people when it comes to ordering with all of our leave this out, add this, and food allergies, but they ALWAYS get it right and never make us feel like we are a pain in the butt for ordering a certain way. It's awesome to finally find a good, fresh, not heavy feeling Chinese food restaurant! Thank you Taste of China :)"}
{"text":"This is a hard review their food is actually good, it's better if its delivery and you don't see how the place looks it's kind of dump and not in a great or charming way.   The delivery is fairly quick and it's pretty good in the very limited role of east valley Chinese food.   The problem is there service is rotten and check your order because chances are good something critical has been forgotten!   We like the sweet and sour shrimp it's good and hard to mess up but at least half the time they forget to bring the sweet and sour sauce and there shrimp is not good enough to eat not covered in there tasty sweet and sour sauce.   So the verdict if your trying to get Chinese food delivered in Gilbert give them a try but don't expect great service and check your order carefully before the driver leaves because they won't come back if you let them leave!"}
{"text":"One star for fast delivery. The food was horrible. The broth in the wonton soup tasted like water. The egg roll had something like cinnamon in it. Very bizarre, not good. The crab puffs barely had any filling and were very sour. I got cashew chicken as a entree, if was fine but nothing to write home about. The veggies were a very mushy and lacking in flavor. Fried rice was pretty bland. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Roomie just got takeout from here. Possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted. It's like they buy overdue/ expired produce and boil it.. and then warm it up for people who order delivery. There's zero flavour and everything tastes expired. They don't even have the basics of ginger and garlic or soy sauce base in anything they cook. I like.. really can't believe it but this is most definitely the most disgusting Chinese food I've ever tasted.  It's unbelievable how bad it is.  On the upside it's fast delivery for terrible food!  It's really quite astounding how good the other reviews are. WHO ARE YOU?"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something, Taste of China is the very best restaurant in Gilbert hands down. The owner, Mr. Taste, knows what he is doing and this place consistently has the best Chinese food you can get anywhere. The fried rice is top notch, the food is wonderful and always perfectly prepared. The Hot and Sour soup is a must, as is the Kung Pao Chicken, the best iteration of these dishes I've ever had.  5 out of 5 stars! Can't get enough Taste."}
{"text":"A bowl of Cha Sui with Wonton Noodle Soup ( $5.95 before tip and taxes) on a first visit to this restaurant.   Had heard a lot of good things, but my meal was too sparse to form any strong opinion.   My impression is that the menu is a bit of a throw-back to earlier times (not in a bad way).   The wonton soup was unlike that in most places serving it now.   Impressed enough to warrant a future visit...."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in the SE Valley. The egg rolls are delicious. The only thing I don't like, with the fried rice, the egg is in huge chunks and with the vegetable fried rice, the veggies are in huge chunks."}
{"text":"ok I'm not really a fan of this place but when it gets to choosing a late night(or early morning?) snack/dinner/breakfast place you can't be very picky.  So few friends and I ended up in this place few times when we were craving for food and everything around was closed. I believe their kitchen closes around 430am-5am as it's always about time we arrive there. the variety for vegetarians is ok. though sauces have to be checked just in case. otherwise not bad and you can have an ok dish for under $10. very recommended for late late night food.  oh right - the food is super greasy... hmmm...  portions are huge...thumbs up plastic table cloths are funny... well the way they clean the tables using these tablecloths... the laziest method ever hahaha"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time but they've lost my business. I will never eat here again. The guy I talked to was completely rude they lost my business forever. Bad service average Chinese food. Not worth anything."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we have had in the east valley that delivers and is prompt and never gets the order wrong. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Took a hour and a half for delivery when they are only 10 minutes away. The wantons are basically just chips. They were not filled with anything. The fried rice was the only thing that actually tasted decent. The rest of the food was pretty bland. Probably won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place has bomb Chinese food.  All the dishes we had were excellent.  The wait staff attentive and perfect.  We even witnessed the change over from the dinner linens to the party plastic late night table 'clothes' - that was exciting.  In terms of Chinese food in China town - you can't beat this place! also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Another casualty, used to be better quality, portions and lower price. Now seems the major ingredient in all of the dishes now are onions. Have to compensate some way I guess for the higher minimum wage."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Got delivery, they sent me the wrong dish and when I called to let them know the lady's response was that \"you don't understand Chinese food\". I had ordered noodles and they didn't deliver it, what is so hard to understand? Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Canned peas and carrots in shrimp with lobster sauce.  Service was friendly but it couldn't overcome what was quite possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just went to Taste of China for the first time on a recommendation of a friend for a real good seafood restaurant in Chinatown. I went late night, around 11pm on a Friday night and the restaurant showed no sign of closing anytime soon.  As I was really the only one eating, while I salivated over the menu (which appropriately lists many items as seasonally priced) I was only able to get 2 dishes. My fish dish was the Salt and Chili Fried Squid and I also ordered the vegetable fried noodle to starch it up.  The veggie fried noodles were pretty average, not great but fine, but the squid was really nice, chewy and while chili-flavoured, not overwhelmingly so. The veggie noodles were about 8$ which is fine, with the squid running around 10$.  The atmosphere is pretty average. Plastic bag tables, very minimal but from my experience and of others, it's really a great place to go for fish. The service is pretty quick but you may need to get their attention to get your bill."}
{"text":"The food here was terrible!!! I ordered garlic shrimp with white rice to go. First of all It took them 30 minutes to make food that tasted terrible. The shrimp literally had diced garlic  on it and it tasted like it was straight from a freezer and they just microwaved it. I paid over 12 dollars for the shrimp or it might have been 14 dollars and it was not even deveined. The food was very bland. Just not worth the time or the money. Maybe everyone on here has a different experience than I did but I would never ever order from here again. Just merely disappointing. The people there were nice but the food was just nasty. Sorry guys :("}
{"text":"I live just a few minutes from this restaurant but usually go to Hunan when I have a craving for Chinese food.   This past weekend, I wanted a little something different and I'm glad that I ventured to Taste of China!   I ordered the dinner combo which included Szechwan chicken, fried rice and an egg roll for $5.95.   What a deal!  The portion was generous and better than I expected.  The Szechwan chicken was chock full of fresh veggies and packed with just enough spice.  The fried rice was not at all greasy and the egg roll was perfectly fried, crispy and fresh.  I loved everything about this meal and will definitely return....soon!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall in a small strip mall, but better than average food.  Lunch specials are a really good deal and portions are enough to have leftover food.  I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great place for late night Chinese takeout & delivery! The service is very quick and the portions are huge. I ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, Bitter Melon with Beef and Cantonese Chow Mein after coming home late one night. I placed my order around 2:30am and within 25 min, the food was at my door! Every item was delicious and I had enough leftovers to eat for a few days after sharing with a few friends."}
{"text":"If you're looking crappy chinese food, look no further.  I was saying at a friends house in Gilbert, wanting some food delivered so I decided to yelp it, as I always do in Hermosa Beach (yeah okay call me a snob) however, most people that yelp 5 stars, even if it's not 5 stars its still decent.  The cost is cheap, but it should be cheaper, considering the quality of food is so poor and the taste is so bland.  This is not the Taste of China, this is the taste of blandness that should be served in an old folks home for the elderly that have no taste buds.  I ordered items that people reviewed on, such as \"They have awesome general Tsao Chicken\" and \"My fav is the crab puffs\"   Are you hiiigh!? the crab puffs were more like crab flats, with hardly anything in them and all dried out.    Luckily, I had a sense of humor so when I ate it, I said \"Man this is so disgusting that its good\"    All I am saying is, if you like good cheap, hole in the wall type food, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Dragon & Phoenix, eh pretty bad. I went to lunch here once and then never again. The chef got the order wrong and put the wrong vegetables in my Dragon & Phoenix and gave some of the other ingredients in my dish to my brother. I tried the fried dumplings, they weren't any good either and the dipping sauce was mediocre. My advice, avoid this place at all costs. Your hard earned money is better spent at a different Chinese take-out restaurant."}
{"text":"After 10+ years of ordering delivery from this place, we are trying other places. This was close, fast and convenient but I realized i was getting sub par food in exchange. They never put enough veggies in their entrees, the CRAB rangoon is cream cheese and are stale every time we get them. We have had many of the same dishes over the years and it never improved so we are trying others places in the area. They always give you extra sauce for your food and the presentation in the bag was good but I want veggies in my sweet and sour chicken not just chicken and 4 large green pepper slices for example. Bland food."}
{"text":"The two course peking duck is pretty good. I also had fried rice take-out here once. Was OKAY. There isn't much service but the inside is clean and decorated. It is a bit more expensive than the other places around the area though."}
{"text":"\"There were blue metal chairs and basic tables both rectangular and circular with numerous layers of plastic table cloths probably to make the cleaning easier. The walls were light green and beige with dark wooden elements and an authentic floral patterned carpet. \"  \"We had their Spicy Filet Mignon with Broccoli. This was a heavier dish, yet the way the thinly sliced beef was prepared made it very tender. The steamed broccoli made a bed where the beef lied, mixed in with a bean sauce, spicy red peppers and some green ones.\"  \"As for A Taste of China, if you ever feel intimidated to try a Chinese restaurant, this is just the place for you. Ling, the owner, is known to help people find out what they like and guide them in making decisions through the overwhelming choices and culture surrounding one as soon as they step through the front door. \"  A few bites from our full experience.."}
{"text":"It was around 2ish in the morning and it was munchie time and my friend and I were trying to figure out where to eat. So we randomly drove to find a Chinatown spot.  We only choose this spot because it was open still and there was parking right in front. The food was just okay; we ordered an eggplant dish which was all right. I ordered what I believe were Shanghai noodles and it was greasy but not exactly what I was hoping for but can't expect much for a place that has ghetto fab plastic bag table covers. (Ditto to the previous review.)  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"Location- crowded area  Ambiance- nothing out of the ordinary - dated - bathrooms are old  Friendliness of staff- could have been more more welcoming   Dishes bought- chicken with black bean, generals Tsos chicken and shrimp with eggplant  Taste- all very good- fried rice was excellent   Quality- very good  Presentation- nothing spectacular   Improvement needed- bathroom"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience! Everything is ready in 10 minutes! Best Chinese take out in the area that I've experienced! I love the house Lo mein and the black pepper chicken."}
{"text":"I love Taste Of China. I eat here at least once a week. Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small. Also, they are incredibly fast. If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes. Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house. My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken."}
{"text":"The sauces are good. I am going to suggest trying this restaurant in person, as my food was delivered and on time, but the items that should have been somewhat crispy were not at all. I don't know if different delivery packaging would help or if the food needs to be fried or stay in the skillet longer...?  The delivery guy was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! This is my new favorite Chinese food place, its close and fast. The food is great, super tasty. The delivery came 15 mins earlier than projected and I got wontons with my order. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The sweet and sour chicken comes with the sauce in a cup and breaded and fried chicken in a \"pail\". Sauce and chicken? Average tasting and average cost. Kung Pao Chicken is not recognizable, somewhat less than average in taste, and average price. Combination fried rice is something less than average in taste, but average in price. All in all, there are much better Chinese restaurants with take-out and delivery, and some are cheaper. This is not out first choice when we're Chinese food hungry."}
{"text":"Got 2 orange chickens and a honey chicken. Absolutely disgusting. It was like breaded fat chunks. Why the hell would you even do that? It's not that chicken is  expensive. Complete scumbag move by a scumbag restaurant. It was like cubes of pork fat or something. We threw it all out any went to Panda Express. I didn't want to waste the time to return it you have to get into a big argument with the owner. Just avoid this shit hole at all cost."}
{"text":"I ordered Terryaki chicken and Chinese vegetables. My food was delivered fairly quickly via Grubhub, but the food is a complete disappointment.  My supposed Terryaki chicken, which is supposed to be grilled, is bland and 100% not grilled. The meat looks and tastes like it was boiled on water with zero seasoning. The Chinese vegetables were only just a tiny bit tastier than the chicken disaster, and the fried rice tasted like scrambled eggs with a touch of salt - I don't even know HOW they managed to do that! I'm super upset, and I feel like I wasted my money. This food is horrible, and clearly they'll never get another dime from me!"}
{"text":"You need a good Chinese delivery wherever you go. This was ours, in Madison.   We tried 3 or 4 others - including Rubys - and none of them could pass our litmus: it must be able to produce a decent General Tso's Chicken that isn't too sweet or gooey with a modicum of heat, the egg rolls must be fried in clean oil and we should never see canned vegetables.   They generally succeeded.   However, I've stopped using them because the young guy that answers the phone frequently (maybe the son?) is such a dick. I've literally called and started giving my order, then he asks me to hold on so he can take another order.   Happy Wok is better and easier to work with."}
{"text":"This is my go-to delivery Chinese.  I have never been disappointed.  The food is always delicious and delivery is super fast and it proved wonderfully! What more could you ask for?? My personal favorite is the orange chicken."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The delivery is very fast and I can't complain about the prices. The food is always satisfactory. It is tasty, not the most authentic by any means, but I have no complaints. Good portions. The delivery people are always very friendly and polite. I order from Taste of China often and would recommend them!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I found a Chinese food restaurant that doesn't actually make me sick or feeling weird hours later because I have a pretty sensitive stomach.   Taste of China is located downtown on Spadina. I never dined inside so I can't give details of the venue but delivery came within 30 minutes, food was hot, portions were huge, even ordering 3 items, was enough to feed 2-3 hungry ass people. If you order over $30, you don't get charged delivery fee.  We ordered C1 Dinner for 2 ( $27)  It comes with Chicken Fried Rice, General Tao's chicken, Sliced Beef with Mixed Vegetables, 2 Vegetable Spring Rolls and Fortune Cookies. We also added Cantonese Chow Mein ($10.95) to the order. Total was about $40.  The food lasted in the fridge for 2 days, it's prolly the best take out Chinese I've yet to come across :)"}
{"text":"Fast for pickup. Chow me in was really good. We also had orange chicken. The place isn't fancy but good for takeout"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE, DO NOT PAY FOR DELIVERY!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE FROM BEING RIPPED OFF!!! I JUST placed my second delivery order from Taste of China. Trust me, believe the comments! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I spent $50.80 on 4 items, Fried Noodles with Mixed Seafood, Deep Fried Squid and Seafood with Seasoned Vegetables, plus steam rice. I ordered pretty much the same meal I ordered on Saturday and I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS RESTAURANT!!! The Fried Noodles With Mixed Seafood was this: ALL NOODLES and 3 pieces of Shrimp, 3 pieces of SMALL Squid, and 3 of THIN  sliced Scallops and 2 leaves of Bok Choi! THAT'S IT!!! When I called back asking what happened to the seafood, I spoke to one man, he transferred me to a woman and immediately she started shouting at me. I explained myself how can a meal cost $12.00 and I get only noodles? The woman called me back again shouting at me telling me that \"You got what you paid for. Some cooks give more, some give less. You can't get the same meal every time you order, you can't get more seafood because you want more. Don't call back--\"then she had the audacity to slam the phone down on my ear!  Even the cook called me back and told me that what he cooked for me is what I get. After fighting for 20 minutes, I was offered by the cook another meal. But, after that I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM TASTE OF CHINA EVER AGAIN!!! I HAVE SPENT WITH TWO DELIVERIES OVER $110 AND NO CONSISTENCY WITH DELIVERY ORDERS! I thought that I wouldn't be one of their scanning victims because this is what I wrote from Saturday AND GAVE THEM 4/5 (STAR LOST BECAUSE OF MSG), but THIS is unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"An hour drive to Toronto's Chinatown usually ends with a meal here.  The decor is nothing special.  The food is typical Cantonese food done well.  The one dish that brings my family here isn't on the English menu... snails cooked in black bean and garlic sauce.  They prepare them differently here than anywhere else I've seen besides trips to Vietnam.  The back/tip of the shell is cut to allow the patrons to simply suck the juicy morsel out rather than pick at it with a toothpick.  It makes it so much easier to eat these tasty treats."}
{"text":"My family loves Taste of China! Located in the little business strip at Richmond and Highland this our go to Chinese food restaurant for takeout. Portions are large but prices are cheap and the flavors are fresh and tasty. We've tried just about everything on the menu and haven't found anything we don't like! My favorite is the Szechwan broccoli and snow peas (extra spicy), with chicken fried rice and wonton soup. The small size is still enough that you'll have leftover and a large can feed at least 2-3 people. Try them if you haven't yet, I'm sure you'll heed your guilty pleasure.. and for lunch tomorrow too! \"10 minutes!\""}
{"text":"Delivery service is awesome! Fast, hot and fresh! Customer service and food is great!  Recommended."}
{"text":"I wanted shrimp with chinese vegetables, which is a MILD dish.  I asked her to put on extra garlic.  She says they have a dish that is called shrimp with garlic sauce.  It is a HOT sauce.  She failed to mention that!  Not what I wanted at all.  Why not recommend me the shrimp brocolli with garlic sauce, a MILD sauce.  Ruined my whole night!"}
{"text":"They are usually very quick on the delivery time and the food is always fresh and hot when delivered. I get the family special pretty much once a week and it is consistently good. the orange chicken is blan at times, but when it's not it is very delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a decent chinese food delivery."}
{"text":"Eating here always reminds me of small back alley restaurants in old parts of Hong Kong where the service is efficient yet warm and the food is genuine and cooked authentically.   Not the most attractive from the outside but we stumbled upon it by accident and it is now our new go-to for Chinese food downtown. Although its called 'taste of china' the dishes and staff is much more Canto style than mainland Chinese cuisine.   If you like lamb, they prepare a really delicious lamb hotpot in sizzling bean curd soup that is so perfect for the cold weather. Ask to have the gas stove on your table as you can keep the meat warm throughout your meal and add in the lettuce that comes with the hotpot. There is a very generous portion of lamb along with lots of bean curd skin and Chinese mushrooms. Add a bowl of rice and it definitely more than enough food to feed 2 people.   For more traditional canto dishes, their sweet and sour pork really hits the spot as well as their baked oysters topped with loads of garlic and vermicelli.   Every time we've been there, they have offered their soup of the day and the daily dessert on the house. For a very reasonable price, we always walk out of here super satisfied and with our bellies about to explode!"}
{"text":"Still terrible. If you read the other reviews you will hear about people getting sick, overcharged and very disappointed.  My review was a little kinder, after three tries I consider this place just another horrible greasy Chinese disaster available in any town for those who want to take the chance. Good luck and please post your experience!"}
{"text":"Worst service, barely speaks to you. Food wasn't that great. Never coming back or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick bite on a Tuesday night. Were seated right away. The place is bright and clean with white table cloths. The menu is extensive including both seafood, meats and veggie dishes. The food came quickly and hot. It was very tasty. We only had a few Cantonese dishes but they have spicy Szechuan items as well. This will be our new go to spot on Spadina."}
{"text":"After having a get together with some friends, we decided to walk through Chinatown and grew hungry, so we stopped to eat at Taste of China.  The restaurant was fairly full, but they had a table prepared us pretty quickly.  The staff  was friendly and efficient.  In total, we ordered 5 dishes:   Cantonese Filet Mignon (????)  Seafood Special (????)  House Special Fried Rice (????)  Stir Fry Noodles with Chicken and XO Sauce (XO????)  Mixed Veggies (??)   The quality of the dishes was excellent.  I enjoyed the sweet and savory Cantonese Filet Mignon and the seafood special was delicious.  The fried rice, noodles, and veggies were also tasty, restaurant quality dishes that I though were slightly above average.  We also received a complimentary appetizer soup and complimentary dessert from the restaurant.  Excellent food. Above average service. If I'm looking for a good eatery around Chinatown area, this place would get a recommendation.   4.0/5.0"}
{"text":"Meh the food was decent but the place was kinda weird. There's other better Asian places than this one and this is the last time I'll go to this one tho"}
{"text":"This was gross, the chicken teriyaki was nasty and bland. The pieces of chicken were white and unflavored. Aslo, the egg rolls did not taste like egg rolls. This was not worth the money, very disappointed. This was definitely not a taste of china."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" best word to describe my experience here.  I came here based on many yelp reviews and was greatly disappointed.  A few quick points : The table was dirty when we arrived.  The bathroom, was a disaster.  The server did not know the menu of what the ingredients were.   As someone who is allergic to peanuts. I asked the waitress what was in one of the dishes if there was peanuts and she informed me 1) she didn't know what the sauce was 2) didn't know what was in it 3) the sauce comes from an outside distributed and they have no idea where or what it is.  So they are serving food from unknown source with no knowledge of what is inside. Great.  We had come here around 12 am. And realized we were out of options so continued to stay.  The food once arrived had no particular Remembrance as this was just another Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Is there anything worse then below average chinese takeout? Thought I would try a new place and now I know why I should stick with some of my regulars. The entrees were dry, and blah. What meat (general tso's) was in there was flavorless. The rice was very much the same- dry and not much to it. Vegatable egg roll...eh. 2 stars because the portions were decent, but I guess what does that matter if you don't feel like eating it? I'll try to give them another shot sometime, but for now, back to places I know are 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to critique the food, however, the service was so terrible that we didn't even get to order anything. We got our drinks right away, but 15 min later and no one had come over to take our order and it wasn't even very busy. Meanwhile, as we waited, what appeared to be the owner, was busy clearing away dirty dishes from tables rather than checking on customers. Also, we were forced to sit and watch an infomercial playing on the tv... no background music, no ambiance, crappy decor. Once we decided to leave, bcuz the wait was too long, the waitress and \"owner\" suddenly decided they wanted to take care of us. and they still charged us for our drinks."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - but I'm rounding up because they have never screwed up my order!  It's inexpensive Chinese take-out from a strip mall so I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised with my first visit and will continue to return.  I ordered the General Tsao's Chicken lunch special for $5.75 and OMG it was a LOT of food (it lasted 3 meals for me)!  The lunch special came with an egg roll (pretty good, nicely spiced), fried wontons (kinda bleh), and fried rice.  The fried rice was much better than I expected, chock full of pork, shrimp and chicken.  The chicken entree was also very good - no extra charge for all white meat is a big thumbs up in my book.  Along with my lunch special, I ordered a small beef chow mein for my son and found the noodles to be well-cooked and not at all mushy. They didn't skimp on the beef either.  I'm not saying this is fancy restaurant quality cuisine, but when you consider the abundance of meat in the dishes and the large quantities, the value for money spent here is excellent.  The service was also very efficient and polite, on the phone and in the restaurant.  Taste of China is now my local Chinese take-out!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and tasteless.   Soup was jelly-like and all food except orange chicken tasted basically same."}
{"text":"Came here with the family , and it exceeded my expectations. Food was great and the service was awesome. We ordered the orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, and pork chow mein. All of it tasted amazing , the pork chow mein is what will bring me back again. Aside from the great taste , the portions were large !"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends and was able to try a variety of dishes. All of them were very good and had very large portions for reasonable prices. I liked playing with the Lazy Susan. Would have preferred if the servers spoke english better, but they were patient with us staying for long, and you can't expect much in Chinatown anyways. The restaurant was fairly busy, so it got pretty loud."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  Fresh, tasty and affordable.  Don't let the small dining room fool you most orders are to go."}
{"text":"Best to go to \"Taste of China\" with a group of five, that way you can order a bunch of dishes and try a lot of different good food.   The Spicy Fried Squid is always perfect here.   Steamed Oysters with the Black Bean sauce, are also really good.   This is the typical for Toronto chinese restaurant.  My friends and I consider this the best one on the Spadina strip right now.   Service is always friendly and efficient, the food is always fresh and good."}
{"text":"The lunch specials is well worth the $6 my son had the shrimp in lobster sauce which also came with an egg roll fried wonton soup delicious I had the orange chicken which was mostly chicken surprisingly enough delish. The decor average but we have to remember there a new business and there just starting out so give them a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Christmas Day day dinner couldn't get any better despite the wait. Fried prawns, crispy beef and fried rice supreme were delicious! If you get Ling as your server, you're in luck! Just ask for her food recommendations."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area from Ohio. Soda had an odd taste and food was sub par. We eat Chinese all the time and by far the worst we have eaten."}
{"text":"I love this place we come here a lot my family and I love this place this is our favorite Chinese place and out food dose not take long to get"}
{"text":"Placed an order for Delivery and the lady who took my order was very quick, friendly and efficient. She knew the answers to any questions I had and repeated my order back to me to confirm.   Delivery only took about 20-25 mins and the food was still hot when we got it. It was packaged great, they even wrapped the container with the sweet sauce for egg rolls in a separate baggie to prevent it from spilling.  There was a TON of food! If I had known that it would be such big portions I would not have ordered so much. The food was great too. I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best Chinese food I have had, but it was good. The Kung Pao Chicken had a good bite to it and the kids loved the Honey Chicken.   The only cons I could put down, not these are really cons, but it would have made the difference between the 4 stars I gave and the 5 would be that with the care that took with packaging, I would have expected they would put soy sauce and other condiments along with it. Also the Egg Rolls were not as good as I hoped they would be.  While we won't add Egg Rolls to our order next time, I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful mixed sauteed vegetables. (compbination of Bokchoy, those small corn cobbs, mushrooms, leek) and a spicey crispy squid. Everything was really hot upon arrival at the table. I really like this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"placed delivery order for supposedly their long time best diish spicy crispy beef. the guy on the phone was rude and impatient, could not even give suggestions for other items. this dish came out to be chunks of fried dough, did not find any  beef there. also ordered spring rolls which came to be 2 pieces of sticky dough again for 5$. very disappointed, wasted money"}
{"text":"Been going to Taste of China for several several years now, probably since 2003 or around there. Love the orange chicken and teriyaki chicken but my favorite is the spicy korean beef."}
{"text":"I dont understand all of the low reviews! Whenever I have eaten in, the owner and workers were always nice and polite. The food is always freshly made and tastes very good! They offer brown rice and will make things extra spicy for you if asked. I think they're great and will continue to order from them :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with wife and mom good food plenty large servings hot and sour soup was top notch egg rolls were the best as were the fried shrimp the fried rice was just ok but the rest made up for it."}
{"text":"Had take out from here twice in the last month. Consistently good. Quick delivery. Love that they pack fried items separately from sauces, so they don't get soggy. Order large sizes, and you'll have plenty of leftovers!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They mixed up our order, didn't charge/deliver the rice. When we called about it, they would only deliver the rice at full cost and wouldn't expedite the delivery. Mistakes happen, but they should have offered the rice for free considering our other dishes needed it and got cold while we made our own."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty picky about my Chinese food so to be honest I wasn't expecting much but it surprisingly wasn't bad. I ordered delivery and it didn't take too long during lunchtime. The lunch special is pretty cheap at $5.25 which includes an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll. Kung Pao chicken was a little salty but not bad at all."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from this place and it's SO delicious! Everything is fresh and delicious and they bring enough food that I can have leftovers for lunch.   I'm a big fan of the Chicken and Oyster mushroom dish, the Chinese Broccoli and the crispy shrimp rolls. *amazing*"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese food, for grabbing to eat on the way home from wprk. Crispy egg rolls. Love the Lo Mein and white rice is perfectly sticky.  Best go to for fast and easy!"}
{"text":"Willing to wait 2 hrs for food? Yes? Ok go ahead and give them a call. They take their sweet time with food delivery. Food is average for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here for the moderately priced Chinese food which for the most part hits the spot every single time.   Coming here after the bar or a night going out is great because they close late everyday and I can't think of any better spot with an friendly ambience in the area such as this.   Service is good to bad depending on time of day you go, this place can be really rammed. All in all I say it's a sweet spot and a must try when you're in the city and want some authentically genuine Chinese food.   Seafood here is always on point for me, grab their deep fried soft shell crab, Steamed black bean oysters and or razor clams... Soooo good! Lobster is always a good bonus and of few places in the area their shark fin soup is quite delicious too."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery, $40 worth of food. Maybe we should have tried the seafood... We had a combo for two; the beef was absolutely disgusting and all the vegetables were extremely watery. The fried rice and the spring roll were decent. Then we had an order of vermicelli noodles with chicken and XO sauce; the sauce was non existent and the noodles smelt and tasted horrible. The general tao was good but the ruined by the horrible quality of all the other food."}
{"text":"Taste of China is one of the better Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. We always come here for dinner when we are in the area. Ling (Waitress) is very nice and usually serves us. They renovated the interior last year so looks more modern now with the stone walls. The place is usually packed on the weekends, make sure you reserve in advance or be prepared to wait. The food and price is decent! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We found this place randomly walking around Chinatown. Note to self, if you have the choice, do not go to Chinatown on a Monday evening. Everyone is getting ready for trash day, and it is actually hard to walk around this crowded area with piles of aromateous trash all over the place. I feel that this area, due to the unique diversity of foods, has a much more offensive olfactory trash day experience. It reeked. The restaurant was nice though, very pleasant and quick staff, and the food was delicious. Easy to understand menu, and the expected decor. Nothing horrible to note, everything went well and food is great. Of note, their home made hot oil is very hot and smokey, really really good by my palate. I don't usually put hot oil anywhere, but I actually dabbed this one on due to good flavor and heat."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good, Chinese delivery and this one fit the bill. The portions were good and flavor was delicious. Even the next day warmed up, it was just as good. We will def return!"}
{"text":"Food is FAB! FAST delivery, excellent customer service. My orders have ALWAYS been accurate hot and awesome!  Thank you for your excellent food! We refer you to everyone! Soo thankful you deliver to our area...  You're the best in our area, thank you for going above and beyond!  Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery arrives within 30 mins and the food is awesome. Our favourite is the Crispy Fried Chicken (tastes like Max's chicken!). We had tried their General Tao Chicken as well as their steamed scallop all were great!  Order must be at least $30 before tax for deliveries. Wonderful place to order if you're jetlagged and can't sleep at 1am."}
{"text":"Best place to come eat after 11pm, food is greasy but tasty. Great all around chinese fare"}
{"text":"I was told about the goodness of the calamari here, seeing how I'm a big fan of it. It's quite standard in Chinatown, but I discovered that the slices are bigger and the serving is quite generous. The batter is a bit different too, with just a hint of spiciness. Cooked perfectly! No tough calamari. I also ordered the seafood chow mein. The noodles came out extra crispy, as requested. Service was prompt; we asked for additional items which were brought out immediately. Deciding when I should go back for more calamari!"}
{"text":"I typically order from here for delivery... and boy they're FAST! They have decent Chinese food (nothing out of the ordinary), and their prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"THE SCENARIO:  So I was really craving some noodles and ramen after rolling out of bed one Sunday (hangover, dehydration, headache, couldn't be bothered to cook, etc etc) so I decided to prowl through Toronto and go to the place that had the cheapest bowl of ramen (my sad, hungover self also established a pretty arbitrary scale that also focused on the tradeoff between hunger/distance walked/price). Saw this place with it's $6 bowl of BBQ pork ramen on the menu posted in the window and walked right on in.   THE FOOD:  The ramen was pretty solid - nice, hot, salty sodium-water (I mean, broth) and a chunk of thin egg noodles. Pretty good heap of boy chow (my weekly 1 serving of veggies) and a generous amount of BBQ pork (deliciously fatty and soggy from the broth). I entered alone and ended up getting seated at a table for six since they had no other open tables, and proceeded to attack my ramen in the most unwomanly way possible, slurping up a storm and drinking every last drop of broth. But hey, it's ok because they have plastic tablecloths.    THE SERVICE:  Practically nonexistent. I think the restaurant is family owned, because the middle aged man was waiting on all of the tables by himself and a middle aged woman was sitting in the back peeling veggies and wrapping wontons. Since it was a Sunday, it seemed like some of the kids were there to help to, although they kept bringing the rice or tea to the wrong tables and the middle aged man (the dad?) was getting visibly annoyed at them. Gist of the story is - do not expect good service, or honestly, even service at all. The dad definitely seemed to be waiting all of the tables by himself, and was rushing back and forth from the kitchen. A few of the patrons were definitely getting visibly annoyed. They seemed to have forgotten to bring one dish that a neighboring table ordered, and they pretty much ignored me the entire time I was there. I had to go up to the register to pay because I couldn't figure out how to get my check otherwise.  THE CONCLUSION:  6.00$ for some good old Chinese comfort food - would come again!"}
{"text":"One of the most dismal Chinese food experiences with some of the most middling food in the area. This is a restaurant that I would never come into again, and one of the few times I considered not adding any tip at all.  In particular, I ordered the \"Chinese Style Beef\" and when I asked for clarification on what it was, they told me it was beef in sauce. So I gave it a shot. The beef ended up tasting ok, It was thinly sliced pieces of beef tenderloin in a black pepper-based sauce.  The main issue that I had with this restaurant was the service. I asked for water from the waiter. He said ok, disappeared for a few minutes, and then when he passed by again, I asked for water again. He nodded again. He passed by again - and I asked again. All in all, it took him ~10-15minutes  to grab me a glass of water."}
{"text":"I don't recommend coming here during a holiday since it tends to be packed, plus lots of takeout orders that they have to deal with.  They also seem to make all dishes for a single table one after another, so if you come right after a large group, expect delays. We had to wait for an entire family of 10 to be served their 25 or so dishes before being served our 3 very simple dishes. We literally waited 30 minutes for our food. They were severely understaffed, had to ask for bill 3 times. The food was pretty mediocre.   They were very apologetic but we were very close to just leaving."}
{"text":"Tremendous take out. Spare ribs are tasty. Lo mein the same. For being a carryout chinese restaurant they have very good egg rolls. General tso and sesame chicken are a must. Always ten minutes."}
{"text":"I like getting my take out lunch from Taste of China.  The place is located in a strip mall.  There are a couple of tables so you can sit down and eat in there if you wish but it's more of a take out place.  The lunch menu options are decent are of a reasonable price.  The food is tasty and the portions are nice.  In the lunch combo, you get your main entree, fried rice and an egg roll.  You can change up the egg roll to soup if you wish.  I've called in small and large orders.  The husband and wife team that work the front always say it'll be ready in 10 minutes.  Check it out sometime."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and as always they have amazing food. They give you a really good portion of food. They are very friendly and provide great service. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area wanting good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and great food. BBQ pork fried rice was delicious. Chicken chow mien was a hit as well! I will be ordering again for sure!"}
{"text":"The waiter lied and said we couldn't use are credit cards just because we ordered rice plates instead of entrees. Excuse me, where does it say that you have to pay with cash if you order rice plates? The total bill was over $20. The policy is that credit cards are accepted if the total bill is at least $20. What a BS service! Do not come to this restaurant if you plan to use your credit card!"}
{"text":"Updating my rating to 4/5!   Again, came here for a family dinner. We decided to order the lobster set menu which came with ginger and onion lobster (2 small ones) sweet and sour pork chop, steamed oysters, scallops and Chinese broccoli, garlic sautéed in snow peas and this deep fried egg tofu. I thought the dishes were very good today! It wasn't too salty or bland. The portions are also sized very well compared to other Chinese restaurants.   Service was excellent tonight (probably because it was slow). We've never been served by this person when we came but he was good making suggestions to dishes and was attentive to our table bringing us napkins and checking if everything was good which 99.9% never happens at Chinese restaurants lol."}
{"text":"So, I'd like to consider myself well versed in take-out Chinese food. I've tried so many places but I usually am pretty picky so I only stick to about two things: orange chicken and/or sweet an sour chicken(basic). When I try a new place, I have high hopes to get my socks blown off. Of course I always get a side of crab puffs because it's a must with Chinese. Anyway. Most places' orange chicken dishes don't ever surpass tasting like Panda Express (eek) and their sweet and sour chicken is typically super breaded with a pinch of chicken. And flavorless without sauce. Well let me tell you.....my socks have been blown!! Here the chicken was lightly breaded, and SEASONED. The crab puffs weren't fried to death, they were fried to perfection and not oily at all. Everything was superb. The lady that took my order over the phone was very sweet. She quoted me 45min for delivery and the guy got to me in 15-20. I think I have found my new favorite take out spot!"}
{"text":"Perfect food.  Many have told me if you want great great Chinese food go to a specifically Seafood restaurant. Fine fine decor.Clean (always a bonus) really good service!! The only blockade to this next to Perfect dining experience is - finding the place!!! It's a.  Here's the trick. A little somebit north of the Chinese restaurant district. Trust me, you'll LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"For over ten years my friends and I have been coming to TOC (Taste of China) for its amazing menu and friendly service.   Everything is delicious, from salt and pepper shrimp to the garlic broccoli they are on the mark with flavour, texture and serving size.   Personal Note: showing up after the bar is always a blast!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Taste of China once a week before we moved away from the area, and we've had trouble finding a new Chinese place we like as much.  The Honey Seared Chicken is very good in particular, and the prices for everything are very reasonable considering the quality of the food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Alright, so I've unwittingly returned to this restaurant twice after selecting it at random the initial time I went here. I'm going to chalk this up to the fact that it when you're in Chinatown, it is nearly impossible to distinguish one restaurant from another if you don't read Chinese, so my brain must have somehow remembered the general picturization of the restaurant sign from my first visit, and was recalling this very instance.  The food here is quite good. I generally get the Sizzling Szechuan Fish, which is thoroughly excellent. The shrimp with eggplant in spicy sauce is also delicious. The fried noodles and fried rice are also great. Basically, I haven't had anything here that I didn't love. Extremely flavourful and yummy. The service isn't great, but isn't terrible. That's about as high as you can expect from a restaurant in Chinatown.   I'll keep returning to this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"THIS is a great little Chinese food place! NEVER a bad meal, always greeted with the utmost in courtesy. I love their ribs, wonton soup, and Happy family. I have eaten there at least 10 times! Those bathroom pictures are ridiculous! Going to order from them again tonight!"}
{"text":"Standard Chinese food. I appreciate how they put the sauces to their entrees on the side so that the customer can sauce their own food (or already that is what has happened on two occasions). I've had the General Tso's chicken which had tasty sauce with a bit of spice. The chicken was real white meat which was refreshing to see. The House Chicken was not as great as other reviewers have proposed. The sauce was almost like a beef broth with some green onion in it; very bland, to say the least. It was liquid, not a sauce.  Prices are average. Service was great. Average Chinese food that I would eat again if need be. I'll probably look elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here has been good. Eat the fried food fresh not that good the next day but everything else is just as good for a reheat."}
{"text":"Taste of China - always my spot for eats in Chinatown, late-night or otherwise.  I first went after cornering a Chinese-Canadian friend who's also a chef and straight up asking him where he eats in Chinatown. Taste of China was the answer.  The food quality is solid. I've eaten there a lot and everything has been up to snuff. But don't take it from me. Take it from the big table with the lazy susan surrounded by staff and servers from other local Chinese restaurants, in their white shirts and black slacks, choosing to eat here after their shifts instead of their own restaurants. Take it from the Susur Lee sightings (he's a cusser I here). This is the place to go,  And they have clean washrooms. Super clean washrooms. I've gone to too many well-reviewed little restaurants only to be turned off by a filthy washroom and thoughts of what the kitchen looks like. Not here.   Go where the pros go. Go to Taste of China."}
{"text":"Don't know how good the restaurant itself is but I work at a hotel (front desk) and I ordered food for 2 separate guests. They messed up the order big time for both rooms and charged each of them about $50 for 2 dishes each. SAVE YOUR MONEY and DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS overpriced place!"}
{"text":"Filthy and disgusting! We like the food here but I will never come back because of the lack of cleanliness in this restaurant. The dining area is\"ok\" but the ladies room has fuzzy mold growing behind the toilet, the sink is gray from the layers of dirt (I wasn't sure so I took a paper towel and cleaned a spot...that gray comes off!), walls/baseboards are very dirty, highchairs don't get cleaned, etc. I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like. I'm surprised the health department hasn't closed this place down."}
{"text":"Absolutely gross. Their egg rolls and won tons are an explosion of grease and some  cinnamon like spice that doesn't belong in chinese food. The house chicken was super rubbery and chopped up all weird in a sauce with a nasty aftertaste and complimented with hard ass rice. If you like hot and sour soup don't go there. It also had a super gross aftertaste , wife said like BO. It was super thick like old gravy and neither hot or sour at all.  i didn't dare try the wife's egg foo yung. Pu pu platter was exactly that.. Another grease stuffed egg roll , skewered beef cooked perfectly into jerky  and 1 spare rib that tasted like it had been cooked and let sit in a fridge for a couple weeks. We literally had 1 bite of  everything and are waiting to see if our dog will eat it. $33.00 dollars straight into the garbage . Sorry but this was a taste of something and it wasn't China."}
{"text":"Worst chinese food I have ever had and overpriced.  We got the PuPu Platter ( Only had 1 beef stick, 1 small egg roll, 2 crab puffs, 3 small pork, and 3 shrimp -  the fried shrimp looked more like fried clams strips they were so small), Pork Fried Rice (it was edible is all I can say about it) Chicken Egg Foo Yung (it was egg patties with frozen peas and carrots, pieces of chicken and no brown gravy), Mongolian Beef (Beef was plain and had no flavor), Orange Chicken (the best thing, but still not that great).  I had to put the sweet sour sauce on everything just to give it some flavor.  I can't believe it had so many good reviews.  Panda Express is better than this place."}
{"text":"I come here for my Chinese food fix.  It's restaurants closer to where I live that even deliver.  I drive right past them to come here.  Some days are better than others but, they are almost always very good.  No matter how big my order, it's always 10-15 minutes. I usually leave out of there with a big box of food so 15 minutes is great.  The food is always piping hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Order 4 egg rolls, Hot and sour soup, pork fried rice and Vegetables in a curry sauce.. I have to say everything i order was outstanding... This is one of the best chinese food experiences i have ever had.. Dont eat it all that often.. But everything was great... Will definately Be back and recommend.. Great Job"}
{"text":"My fella and I just did delivery from this spot and from that one experience alone they take top marks for Chinese places that deliver. We got crab rangoons (free with coupon), wonton soup, general tso's tofu and Mongolian beef which both came with steamed rice.  The crab rangoons were tasty and come in a package of 8 with a sweet sauce. A very plentiful freebie although the sauce is not my thing.  The wonton soup came with 3 hefty dumplings and was flavored with a large slice of ginger - definitely different, definitely delicious. The soup also came with crispy noodles.  The General tso's tofu was actually pressed tofu that had been seared, not just fried bean curd tossed in sauce. The sauce could have been a little spicier as I requested the heat level to be higher - but that's okay. A good dish overall.  The Mongolian beef though! The beef was actually seared and served with green onions, water chestnuts, and on a bed of chow mien-esque noodles. The sauce actually was a little spicy and scrumptious! This dish was a perfect departure from how others do it in town. I would not hesitate to order this again - 5 stars for certain!  Delivery was fast, hot, and accurate.   From what I experienced here I would not hesitate to go back and I can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"3 stars in the grand scheme of Toronto restaurants. 4 stars in the Chinatown context.  I aim to be like Taste of China Seafood Restaurant (TofC): very bland and to the point on the surface but all sorts of delicious and quirk on the inside!  I had read Joanne Katz's review of TofC and she had sung its praises and had ranked it as high as 22 in her list of the best restos one year! I am not a big fan of JK but was intrigued nevertheless. So when we found ourselves ambling past TofC enroute to Pho Hung, I stopped mid track and demanded we go to TofC. There was a line-up, which furthered my determination, so after a 20 min wait we found ourselves in the bosom of TofC.  I was intrigued by all the colors and smells on the tables around me, large groups of people ordering lobster, crab fried rice and all sorts of other om nom noms.  We were a motley crew with unrefined palettes and went with our gut when it came to ordering: salted and spiced pork loin, fried peppery squid, shrimp fried rice and shrimp with cashew nuts and veggies. Not the most inspired choices but that's why I want to return.  Our food took a little time to appear but that just whetted our appetites and also gave us a chance to witness the quirky servers at their best: at an adjacent table, when the bill came, the little girl tossed the bill to her parents and devoured all the fortune cookies. Seeing this, their server came back and showered the girl with fortune cookies to last her a lifetime. The squeals indicated that Christmas had come early!  Anyways, the food that finally appeared was mostly delish:the pork loins were delectable, crispy and crunchy: very, very fresh and I liked the smell that emanated from them. Also, the light condiments that accompanied the pork loin were a good touch. The squid was equally good: lightly battered, crisp and nicely peppery. The shrimps with cashew nuts and veggies were subliminally sweet, no doubt because of the cashew nuts and the veggies gave us an appearance of health. The fried rice felt quite dry and bland but adding the chilly oil added nice flavor.  We had so much food left over which we were only too happy to take back with us. Our server asked us at the end if we had enjoyed our meal. Whoda thunk in Chinatown? We assured her that we enjoyed our meal, and thanked her for her help in helping us make up our minds. We also assured her that we'd be back, maybe next time at 4 am.  TofC may not be haute cuisine but my taste buds were very happy nonetheless."}
{"text":"Update on previous review:  Called to order some Sunday dinner & was told they were not able to make food without MSG.  Guess I'm back on the hunt for a good Chinese spot, which in a city with such a high Chinese populations shouldn't be this difficult. *sigh"}
{"text":"I ordered food from Taste of China for pick-up. The customer service was pleasant and prompt, and I even got to use the \"Buy 1 Entree, Get 2nd 1/2 Off\" coupon from their website. Their food was fresh and their attention to properly cooking the vegetables is noted, however I found the food somewhat underseasoned.  Hot and sour soup lacks the peppery and sour bite that I expect. Similarly, the Spicy Korean Pork, which is specifically denoted as hot and spicy on their menu, fails to deliver the heat. I did like the Honey Seared deep-fried Shrimp, but had to augment the lack of seasoning with soy sauce.  All decent Chinese food, but really could use some MSG! Or if not MSG specifically, they need to raise up the level of spice and umami in their dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered crab puffs, combo rice, general's chicken, Mongolian beef, and the honey walnut skrimp. Been to hundreds of Chinese spots. Mongolian beef is not recommended."}
{"text":"My oldest daughter and I dined here one evening.  Neither one of us was very hungry so we shared an appetizer, we each had a bowl of soup and we shared steamed rice.  I had the won ton soup, pictured.  I was surprised at the quantity and freshness of fresh vegetables in the soup.  The rice was, well, steamed rice.  The appetizer we had was crab cheese fried won tons.  They were pretty good but a little heavy on cheese and could have used more crab.  Service was prompt and friendly and the prices were good.  We finished at about 12 bucks."}
{"text":"The place is fantastic authentic Hong Kong food right to your door have them surprise you with set dinners."}
{"text":"To be honest, with this price what else can you expect?! Superb fast delivery that get to your house right in front of your door. The crab puffs, dumplings... The food taste good. Of course can't compare to what I have in Los Angeles or las Vargas, but decent quality in the Phoenix area. I would recommend at least try it once."}
{"text":"I could not believe how bad the service here is. I have ordered many times but tonight I placed an order and called back to ask a question about one of the dishes. The man could not understand me and so I switched my order last minute. When i thought about it I called back two minutes later (I checked the time stamp on my phone) to say I wanted to stick with my original order. The man said it was too late and refused to let me change my order even though I offered to wait if they were busy. Do I just cancelled my order. Really aggravating situation and very rude to a good customer."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant in the city. Dumplings, Shanghai noodles and General Tso. Literally been going here for over a decade..!!! This is the only place to go to late night."}
{"text":"Delivery was super fast and I was shocked that the driver was able to find my apartment.  Usually I have to meet drivers in the parking lot.  It's not the best Chinese food I've had, but it's not the worst either.  I would order from them again when we really don't feel like jumping in a car."}
{"text":"If you live on the East side or Monona, give these folks a try. It's kind of standard Chinese delivery, so if you want real soy sauce you should have some at home.   The crab Rangoon are basic and kind of small, not bad but not great either. Get a bottle of Mae Ploy from Asian Midway to dip these in, because the sweet and sour they send is kind of basic, too. No big one to me, though- I have all my sauce bases covered. You should see my fridge... ;)  The Ma Po tofu has no meat in it (usually has pork but I am A-OK without it!), and the fried dumplings could have been a little more... stuffed. Ordering over the phone was easy, and they take credit cards. Delivery was within 35 minutes and it was super nice and hot. I will be ordering again. It sure did hit the spot for my wan fan... hao chi."}
{"text":"The food is average for Chinese take-out - nothing spectacular so far but nothing bad either. These folks have always delivered our orders accurately and on-time, and their prices are reasonable. You can't ask for much else."}
{"text":"Short and sweet, I enjoy the food here we always get general Tao chicken & fried rice with wonton soup I reccomend anyone passing through spadina to check it out"}
{"text":"First off, this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Toronto.  But brace yourself for plastic table cloths; they use the linen ones for dinner!  Their cantonese chow mein, duck and squid offerings are to die for!    The staff is just attentive enough (so as not to be a nuisance); the portions are a good size and well-worth the never-too-slow wait period.    The menu is wide and is going to appeal to everyone's taste:  we are talking home-comfort  meals here!  But in terms of accessibility, the main entrance makes no provisions for wheelchairs and the washrooms - while on the main floor - are small and marginally acceptable.   Indeed,  the washrooms themselves could use a little work!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've only ordered for delivery and it's always been early, hot, and the food tastes great. I was unsure because some of the reviews were not so good. I was wrong. Would order again for sure."}
{"text":"This place used to be the go to spot. Real Solid for the most part. Now the food is horribly bland and the egg rolls have some spice in them that is super nasty.  Sad"}
{"text":"Pretty solid little shop.  We had the egg rolls, orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, and chicken chow mein.  The pork was lightly battered, which I prefer.  My Dad was a fan of the chow mein.  Cheap, fast, enjoyable = win"}
{"text":"Hit and miss items on the menu. I'm always looking for the best Mongolian beef and it was not found here. However, the amazing chicken is amazing! Egg drop soup is fresh. Lettuce wraps are really good and crab puffs are delicious. Tried the jalapeño chicken and it was pretty good too. Really nice staff and the nicest looking Chinese restaurant I've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"How dare they serve shark fin soup. They cut off the sharks fins off then throw the finless sharks in the ocean to die a slow 3 day death. Take shark fin soup off your menu, then I will gladly give you and my colleagues business."}
{"text":"Called for delivery and ordered crab puffs and egg rolls for appetizers. Asked for extra sweet and sour to which we got none at all. I  called and asked if they could bring us some, to which the replied no. I asked if we could get a discount, they replied no. I overheard the girl on the other end accuse me of yelling. I did not at any point yell. Slightly passive aggressive.....probably. So I had to drive and get the sweet and sour sauce to go on said crab puffs and egg rolls. When I got to the restaurant I asked to speak to the manager. She apologized and stated that no one had spoken to her about any of it, and stated that they would have had it delivered. The food is good, but the staff that answers the phones is lack luster at best."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this restaurant for the first time, and boy was I disappointed. Ordered General Tso chicken and half of the chicken wasn't fresh and hard to chew. Ordered another dish and it was just mediocre, bland and tasteless. Also, the chicken in the second dish was close to being raw (totally under cooked). Had to throw away most of my food. I could get better food at a shopping mall cafeteria, and for a cheaper price. I don't know how they can serve this type of food at their price point. Perhaps it was a bad day for the chef, but doesn't matter, I still wasted a lot if money. I still gave them two stars because although the guy on the phone couldn't speak English very well, he was still cordial with me. And also because the food came within a reasonable time frame."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. The food is fresh, with the right level of flavour.  The service is always friendly"}
{"text":"Place was clean and staff was friendly but the food was flavorless.  The orange chicken was mediocre everything else was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Best Chinese carry out I've had recently. We ordered Hunan chicken was nice. Plenty of chicken. Lo mein is one of my favorite Chinese dishes and theirs was very tasty. Cashew chicken with breaded and fried we liked the flavor but would have preferred sautéed chicken in it. All in all we'd go back next time for Chinese carry out."}
{"text":"The food here is great!  I love the broccoli chicken and the shrimp fried rice. Honestly I have several dishes that I really like. Delivery is fast and convenient!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Every time we have a craving for Chinese food, Taste of China is our go to restaurant. Normally when we go alone we just order a couple of dishes and are always pleased with the results. The food is always plentiful and delicious. Last night we introduced friends to the place and they ordered main dishes and some appetizers and we were all surprised by the size of the appetizers. They came out the same size as regular main dishes. There is no doubt that you get your money's worth at the restaurant. The place is popular and always busy even though the service is never that great. I guess when you have great food you don't have to worry about stellar service."}
{"text":"What Taste of China has going for it is its proximity to neighborhoods. Not the very best of Chinese cuisine but very predictable. We know what we are getting on those occasions we don't want to cook. Have eaten in and taken out with same results. Haven't messed up our order."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience with taste of china. I get delivery a lot and love their combination house noodles. Fast, yummy and satisfy my Chinese cravings."}
{"text":"We've been eating here pretty much since they opened, I can't believe it's taken me this long to Yelp about it. The food is always fast, fresh, and has good flavor. The prices are good, and they usually have a coupon of some kind on their website. Daughter loves the crab puffs. I love the Shrimp with Vegetables and the husband loves the House Chow Mein. For fast Chinese food that isn't Panda Express, go here. Just as fast, you'll spend just as much and you'll get better food."}
{"text":"So you're sick and coughing out a lung or two.. what do you do?  The traditional cantonese hk motherly advice is to get congee and veggies.  But wait, you're in downtown toronto, so your options surprisingly are low for congee delivery.. in comes Taste of China.  Which also leads me to my buddy Melissa F. who says this is probably the worst take-out chinese food available.  She's an all-star, so her advice should never be taken lightly.  I rolled the dice as case in point, sick as a dog and I needed congee.  Taste of China wasn't bad.  It's as yelp would put it, A-OK.  The veggies were surprisingly fresh.. so maybe they took Melissa's advice and actually cooked up some fresh veggies for delivery.  My only tip, if you're ordering Congee.. ask them to remove the MSG cause mann this mother's got some.  Which when you're getting dominated by a cold, you don't need anything else that's dehydrating.  They delivered in 25 mins, pretty fast.  Oh and they speak English.  I ordered in Chinglish cause what else would a CBC do right? I make the fam proud.   If I knew about the MSG, Taste of China might have even scored a 4/5.  But then again, I'm running on 2 sleepless nights, so brain functionality is definitely 1/5. I leave these dice with you boss, your roll."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Taste of China several years ago and we've eaten there fairly regularly since. About a week and a half ago we placed a delivery order for dinner and it arrived quickly and hot as usual. We were about halfway through the meal when my friend picked out a carrot from the amazing chicken and it had a baby roach stuck to it.  Immediately we lost our appetites and I called the restaurant right away. The girl who answered the phone seemed shocked but then started giggling. She put me on hold for several minutes while they tried to contact the manager. She came back and said her manager said they couldn't prove the roach was there and offered me a free entree on my next order. I declined telling them we had no desire to ever eat there again and asked for a refund of my meal. She placed me back on hold and came back saying her manager agreed to the refund. I did get my money back but will not be eating Chinese food for awhile and certainly won't be eating it there."}
{"text":"Best place I have ever eaten Chinese food, everywhere should have that house special chicken. The prices are phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place doesn't stand out among a decent crowd of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but it definitely holds its own among them.  The food is usually very hot and delicious.  On occasion, you may find a dish on the salty side, but I doubt you'll ever come across a dish that lacks flavour here.  Definitely worth a try.  Good food, good prices, same ol crappy Chinese service."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The hot and sour soup is very hot, but very taste. This restaurant specializes in seafood, which is one of the reason to go. It is much better then a restaurant across the street which had gotten very popular, and way too expensive. The orange beef, very tasty, the shrimp with garlic scapes is very good. The Singapore noodles are hit or miss, can be good at times, and not great at others. This restaurant is fairly busy all the time. It is a great find!!!"}
