{"text":"Wow,  this was some amazing food. So we stopped by this place the other day for a late breakfast, and yes- this place was amazing, the service is really good, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"We've been to Cindy's a handful of times and it was ok. They have decent breakfasts, can't complain about that. After the last time, though, NEVER again. We went in with the members of our car club. We planned to have breakfast and a brief meeting. The person at the register (the owner I think) was SO rude to us directly as well as the rest of our group, some of which were driving a distance and were running a little late due to bad weather that day. As they entered they were told \"We don't have room for you\". Really???? Seriously??? There is no excuse for rudeness to paying customers. There were 16 of us in total. We ALL, but one, had breakfast. The other person had coffee and toast. So, every one of us were paying customers and I'm shocked that the owner of a restaurant would turn away that kind of business for himself as well as tips for his wait staff. An awful experience unless you don't mind not being appreciated as a paying customer. They're going to end up losing all of their customers if this is the way they treat them. Its not like the food is 5 star either, its ok--breakfasts are pretty good, like I said. However, for us, not worth being treated like an imposition when we're spending our hard earned money for a dining experience. Our club found another nearby restaurant that is more than happy to have our business. We're looking forward to a meeting there soon and being treated like paying customers should."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Biscuits and gravy were very good. Its a short walk from my house so we can work off our food after the meal."}
{"text":"Food is good but music is quite dated and beer license would be a nice addition. Wait staff are small town cafe friendly."}
{"text":"I used to go to Cindy's quite a bit. I love diners in NY and really liked the food there UNTIL about a month ago a friend of mine hadn't been there and i suggested we take the kids there. We are sitting there eating and a roach walks up the wall we flag the older guy Gary I think his name is over and quietly tell him he squashes the roach on the wall with his hand and carts it off no apology or anything. While paying I was saying to bad we can't come here anymore he just blows it off like I didnt say anything.  He is not very customer friendly at all!"}
{"text":"This place NEVER fails me. If you want a good, consistent meal then Cindy's is your place. Great coffee too. And the servers are all friendly and even though I'm not a \"regular\" they treat me like one. Great place for breakfast. I've also had their fish fry and it's AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Would have rated lower if I could. Horrible service over 40 minutes to get our food once we were seated. Food came out cold . My breakfast burrito came out as requested with the shredded beef they use in their chimi, the waitress added American cheese which was disgusting and the beef tasted like it had been kept on the porch with the smokers. My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy which h came out cold and congealed. Needless to say neither of us finished our meals. When I get the bill I see the waitress had added the cheese to my burrito and then charged me for it! Maybe they are understaffed because I overheard her mess up two other orders simultaneously. I live 5 minutes away and I will not be back. It will be hard for me to drive by this place now without felling sick to my stomach . The 20 minute drive to crackers and company is worth it folks if you live in this part of town. Cindys Is an abomination and has no right being called arizona cafe."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and amazing staff. I have been here on many occasions but just finally got a yelp account. Best place in town especially for a dive type of a place. Better than all chains and other local restaurants."}
{"text":"Always GREAT service and love having breakfast here, nice place to stop in or go by and pick up in the AM.  Never had lunch or dinner always get breakfast."}
{"text":"We waited 15 minutes to be seated.  After ordering and waiting another 40 minutes, never once being checked in on by the waitress, we left without receiving our food.  On the way out the door I told the manager we had been waiting over 40 minutes for our food and that was unacceptable.  He shrugged at me and then began assisting people that were just walking in the door.  Horrendous customer service!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I've ever had. The chicken in the chicken and waffles \"special\" was literally frozen, processed, and probably microwaved."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Amazing home cooked food. Highly recommend this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  great breakfast place. Been going here for 3 years.  Try the Gary special"}
{"text":"Delicious down home cooking Will definitely eat there again. Highly recommend. We had the western omelet..pancakes. ..biscuits and gravy. Every one was friendly...great atmosphere. Great service."}
{"text":"Homestyle cooking at its best! I have been going to Cindy's for years, and love the food and the service. The place is old fashionable and historic looking, no frills and tacky. Not for the trendy type person, or the complainer but the food is authentic old style dinner."}
{"text":"First off, the food is good.  Certainly better breakfast fare than any of the frqnchise places.  The quality of food is not the issue.  For 35 minutes, I was completely ignored by the waiting staff - no orders in, nothing.  I don't care how good the food is - when the waiting staff doesn't even come by to take the order, there's a serious problem.  When you're a minority and waiting for that 35 minutes, and you see 4 other tables who arrived after you getting orders in while you just sit there, there's a serious problem.  I heard \"I'll be there in a minute\" several times, but I pretty much had it after the 5th time I flagged a waiting staff down and heard the same thing.  So disappointed, because the food is actually good.  But I don't take such insults too well."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so very picky:  I eat here every so often with my boyfriend, its family owned and pretty darn good.   You'll find it in a small, almost deserted plaza on the NE corner of Mckellips and Mesa Dr. I like it so much, I brought my family here this past saturday, they seemed kinda hesitant cause of the location and it not having the normal chain name (ihop, dennys, village inn)..but they loved it.. my brother is pretty picky about his biscuits and gravy, but he approved.. weirdo.   The usual older man at the front is the owner I think. He is very nice and very welcoming...but the older lady that serves is kinda questionable? maybe i just come on one of her stressed out days? She serves the tables in The Duke room, anyway she warms up towards the end, maybe cause she knows the tip is coming. She forgot to bring our drinks that day, but remembered when she came out with the condiments... no big deal.   Food prices are decent for the portion, but i noticed they did go up within the year.. still good though.   oh and they serve breakfast up till 2pm, which is also the closing time."}
{"text":"We're frequent visitors of Cindy's. Our family of 5 loves it! 2 adults and 3 kids - we can all find something on the menu we like!  Pros: - Things we've ordered that are delicious: chicken fried steak, breakfast burrito, eggs, hash browns, (kids) cheeseburger. - Great service: waitress and cashier are so friendly! - Kids get a treat on the way out! My kids love it!   Cons: - Decor is a little older and it's a bit hokey - One time it smelled like cigarette smoke very badly. I wasn't sure if it was from their patio section or another guest who was a very heavy smoker.  Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed with the fish, advertised as \"Fish Fry\" Friday.  They were ready to close at 7:30pm!!!  The waitress was unapologetic when they ran out of baked potatoes, and charged us MORE to get mashed potatoes and gravy!!   The owner was rather rude and abrupt, as though he couldn't wait to get off work. Worse yet - he wouldn't even look us in the eye when he spoke to us!!  Although there were only a couple of other customers in at that \"late hour\", the waitress only came back to check on us at the end of the meal.    The fish was overdone and over-breaded, but again no apologies, like she must be used to hearing that?  The decorations look like something from my grandma's place in the mid-west from the early 80's, or else all very old yard sale stuff - this place is in desperate need of a facelift!!!  I heard the breakfast is good, but after this experience and other Yelpers' comments, I absolutely will NOT come back!"}
{"text":"Cindy's is a nice diner where it looks like all is the locals hang out. They have one of the best omelettes that I've had in a long time.  You can sub the hash or home fries for fresh fruit for  .85 more. You will get down home service at this place."}
{"text":"Cindy's Arizona Cafe was a very nice treat this morning.  Sampling their breakfast and lunch dishes, our group had the Grecian salad, bacon cheeseburger, a two-egg breakfast with hash browns, toast, and 4 strips of bacon.  Everything was top notch ingredients and freshly made.  My salad was a great assortment of lettuce, carrot, cabbage, cucumber, tomato, olive, house-made croutons and gyro meat.  The vinaigrette it came with was very light and mild, but the zestiness of the ingredients made it unnecessary to have a powerful dressing.  I especially liked throwing in the bell peppers.  My gf and her mom both indicated they loved their meals as well.  I definitely want to go back for a more traditional breakfast, as every table has housemade jam or orange marmalade.  I have a fantasy of just ordering 12 slices of toast and running around the restaurant sampling the jams at all the tables.  Don't be surprised if I do!  In the meantime, consider that 3 of us ate, all ordered drinks, and the total came out to be $28."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the midwest.  Everyone is friendly, the service is good and quick and the food is delicious and calorie-laden, as it should be.  A good place for breakfast.  Generous portions.  The waitress we always get is great."}
{"text":"Wet had the grandpa Jones biscuits and gravy.  That was the best part of the meal. It was good,  nothing great, they gave a big portion.    The bacon, had a salty taste to it.    The hashbrowns were very plain.   Most of their customers are senior citizens,  so the bland taste works for them.    The waitresses were definitely, the in a rush,  don't care,  no chit chat type.  Even though they were very slow.  The food was out really fast though.   It was in its prime,  20 years ago.  Now it's just open for the seniors down the road.    I sadly didn't try their cinnamon bun, that all the reviews say is great.  I'm a big guy,  and I left full, overall,  I prolly won't go back again."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast and Friday Fish fry.  The waitress ' s are wonderful and very friendly."}
{"text":"Were originally from Wisconsin, and these people and the restaurant they run reminds me so much of little cafes back home. You can just tell these people love what they do. The food was delish and perfect for an Easter morning after church. Our waitress was super funny and sweet as can be. My fiancée ordered the cinnamon roll French toast and it was amazing! A little sweet for me, but the few bites I had were awesome. I love little hometown joints like this."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here cause when we would drive by it was always busy. We sat on the patio, it was so dirty!! They allow you to smoke out their and that just added to how dirty it was out their. The waitress was new so I have  her some credit, my food came I got the scrambled eggs, toast, and chicken fried steak. Well the eggs where cold an rubbery, almost as if they where made first and put under a heat lamp. My gravy on my chicken fried steak was cold, and I asked two times for sour dough toast and got white. When I told the man in the front he took a whole two dollars off our bill. I would not even send my worse enemy to this dump!!!!"}
{"text":"Super hungry for breakfast this morning so we headed over. Best cinnamon rolls around!! Breakfast was a dream here!! Seriously so good"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch the other day, as I work in the area and didn't have time to eat that morning, so by the time lunch hour rolled around I was famished. Ordered the meatloaf. Bland. It came with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. All bland and barely warm. I felt rushed (didn't realize they closed at 2pm). The waitress was nice, but the food was way over priced for what I got, and it should have been served piping hot with lots of flavor. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had roaches crawling on the walls and the food was pretty lousy. I got the fruit topped waffles and they were just drenched in sauce making my waffle soggy. I also decided to try the biscuits and gravy but they just were two sad biscuits with what tasted like gravy from a can. There was nothing fresh about this place. Even the cappuccino wasn't even a cappuccino it was just hot chocolate with a bunch of whipped cream. I'm very dissapointed in this place and should've left as soon as I saw the bugs."}
{"text":"Our family was in there about a week ago.  Rude, slow service & rude owner.   The food is very plain and not a good quality, never returning!  I can't imagine anyone giving this place more than one star, unless they are related."}
{"text":"Yeah, the decor is 90's Southwest, but I think that adds to the charm. The food is amazing. You can go healthy if you feel so inclined. And it seems like you can't take 2 sips of coffee with someone coming to refill it. This is my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Once again this place does not disappoint when you want a fresh homemade food thank you Cindy!!!!!"}
{"text":"The overall experience was mediocre. I ordered an omelet which was decent but a little runny for my taste. The biscuits and gravy was very good. The prices were right on target and one of the cheaper breakfast places I have been. Average plate was around $7.50.  We felt a little rushed by the waitress and we could tell she was anxious to get off work. In her defense we arrived a little past 1pm and they close at 2.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go back to this place, however, I wouldn't protest going back either."}
{"text":"One stop I enjoyed while out in Mesa, Arizona was Cindy's Arizona Cafe. The parking lot passing by prior while driving throughout the city a few times suggested to me this was a place of interest for those that enjoy eating. Being a person that enjoys eating, I mentioned one morning we needed to eat at a place that served a warm, country, home-style cooked breakfast that would be followed by a nap.  We showed up the day we were jamming out in fact; Sunday approximately between 8:30 and 9 O'Clock in the good ol' mornin'. Not a bad crowd, even though we waited a second to be sat.. we were able to sit near a window away from most of the folks in the main dining area.   The menu was pretty neat. It had staff favorites to customer favorites to your everyday eggs, ham, bacon, burgers and so on. Relatively to the point, which makes my decision easy. I went with the country chicken fried steak with eggs over easy and home fries. I really don't get to eat the type of breakfast I want to back at home, so when I'm eating I aim for something truly fulfilling to the appetite.  The country chicken fried steak was cooked exactly how I like it. Smooth peppery gravy doused on a piece o' chicken that's breaded and cooked to a perfect crispness. The insides maintain moisture making this dish not only tasty and fulfilling, but borderline refreshing to those of you who are like myself. A fork punctures my egg yolk as it spreads across the entire plate. It says 'hello' to the home fried potatoes and mingles with the gravy that drips off the steak. Yessir, we've hit the spot. Where's the cot for that quick nap??  We were checked on frequently with our water and coffee cups consistently being filled. Not only that, the waitress found our group entertaining and delightful.. At least that's what I was led to believe. She was a sweetheart, bless her little soul.  All in all, Cindy's Arizona Cafe was a sweet little spot that filled ya boy's stomach up proper."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave no stars waited 25 minutes for waitress Cindy to take our orders. Never happened? She Helped everyone beside our table. Rude service never returning."}
{"text":"The inside is gross, we were sat at a cheap plastic outdoor table and olastic outdoor chairs that didn't feel stable. We had breakfast and it tasted like the kitchen has never been cleaned. I didn't even finish my meal...or eat much more than a bite or two."}
{"text":"once seated it took 10 minutes for someone to ask what we wanted was not friendly The floors were very dirty and all the glasses , silver ware was very dirty on the good side food was good for eggs and toast. Even on the way out the host didn't even say anything. If I were you there are much better places to go that are close."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place as it looked like a great diner.  Sadly, the food did not measure up.  With a group of 3, we had breakfast here.  The food was not bad, just 'okay'.  I would probably not go back on my own dime."}
{"text":"Locally owned restaurant with a homemade feel! They are definitely Cardinals fans with personality throughout the establishment- we sat in the John Wayne room. The menu is priced cheap compared to the large portions you get. I love how you can order lunch at breakfast and there is plenty of room so you're not elbow to elbow with the neighbor. The servers even leave small pitchers of iced tea at your table so you don't have to flag them down for a refill. I would recommend this to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I had an early break in my day in another part of town and I was in the mood for breakfast.  I searched Yelp and found this little gem - Cindy's Cafe.  The service was great, every one was friendly and attentive.  I tried the Cindy Omelet, home fries, sour dough toast, and great piping hot coffee.    Breakfast is my favorite meal.  Everything was good, the food came out hot and everyone had a smile.  I will come again.  You can't go wrong dining at Cindy's Cafe."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere in the neighborhood. Great place for a week and breakfast. The cinnamon rolls are really tasty and the breakfast portions are a nice size. The servers are personable and friendly. You can tell that a lot a regulars coming in but they are very welcoming to first-time visitors. This is also a good place to get breakfast to go if you're not interested in dining in."}
{"text":"Cindys is my favorite breakfast spot on the East side of town.  The chicken fried steak is the best I've ever had and consistently cooked to perfection.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the service is good.  Barbara is a wonderful server and extremely friendly.  They have a breakfast bar for those that want to dine by their selves with sociability.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it was here. Tried it on a recent visit and I'm a fan! Delicious gigantic pancakes! Yummy. I'd love to review more food but I only had pancakes, eggs and bacon! It was delish! Give them a try if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"just had breakfast.  Perfect home cooked food!  the place is a little dated, but im trying to shop only local and its a nice little mom and pop place.  :)"}
{"text":"It was a dated atmosphere with lots of knick knacks all over.  The pancakes were terrible as far as I am concerned.  The biscuits and gravy were just okay.  The bacon was not a high quality product .  I sent the pancakes back and ended up with bacon and eggs amd toast and was only a given a 2.00 off discount. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Best mom n pop diner I have been to yet. The waitress was amazing. You can tell she excelled at her job. Had a nice conversation with 2 older couples next to us. Just a good atmosphere. I will be back. And the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Love it here at Cindy's!  The food is absolutely delicious! We always get the breakfast so we can't say much for lunch or dinner. I recommend the pancakes or biscuits and gravy but if we come for breakfast, the place has to have awesome biscuits and gravy. The service is slow and this particular time we only saw our server twice, so come on a day you don't have anything to do. Not to mention,  you will leave full! ;)"}
{"text":"I got the Fettucini Alfredo.  There was a little implied pressure to order a drink and to add grilled chicken to my Fettucini.  The parking lot nearly empty.  I liked the fun music from the 60's.  My pasta was excellent,  creamy and really good.  The garlic bread was perfect.  I look forward to coming back here sometime."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and you won't leave hungry. Some of the waitresses are a little slow and clearly aren't listening to you when you order. The waiting area needs to be expanded as well. On a busy morning you can have 20 people shoved in this little corner. Plus more people coming in. Some people are trying to pay and some are trying to get a table. I think this could easily be solved by letting people pay their server.  I highly recommend the banana nut pancakes!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, most of the staff treats you like family while some of theme seem to mever be happy. The food is good but sometimes it can be a bit of a wait to get your food."}
{"text":"Decent dinner food.  They made the substitutions I wanted without charging extra.  The ambiance was a little haphazard for me.  We had good customer service from everyone but our waitress..but she came around toward the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Cindy's is a somewhat frequent breakfast stop for me - but mostly because it's close by. I love the staff, always friendly & welcoming, and the breakfast menu is great.....but steer clear of the burgers.  Quite possibly THE worst burger I've ever had in my life.  The first time I decided to try one, my boyfriend, who had been going there for years before he brought me, advised against it. I got it anyway and immediately regretted it - cut to a couple years later, I just went there with my dad a few weeks ago and felt like a burger for breakfast, so I gave them another shot. Yuck!! Even more horrible than I remembered!! Clearly just cheap, frozen, unseasoned patties they pan fry and throw on a bun.  McDonald's outshines them in that dept. But stick to breakfast and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's a cute little restaurant. I had the fish and chips and they were absolutely delicious! My waitress Karson was very attentive."}
{"text":"first of all. The waitress was extremely rude and disrespectful. She literally almost made me cry. I don't understand what her issue was but that's not okay to treat customers the way she did. Second of all my food was ice cold. I don't want to eat hashbrowns that taste like they just came out of the fridge. She didn't even bring out half the stuff I ordered. The way she treated everyone at my family was ridiculous. Never coming back. On the positive, the cinnamon roll was good."}
{"text":"Cozy \"greasy spoon\"! Good food, not fancy, snowbird favorite!"}
{"text":"Such a great find! Thank you Yelp, and Thank you Cindy's!  A cute \"diner\" experience with food that tastes like home!    I had the chicken fried steak, because let's face it, if you're going to a diner, you are not looking for healthy food!  It was perfectly crispy on the outside, moist steak on the inside, easily cut with a fork and not a knife.  The gravy didn't make the outer fried coating mushy either, it even reheated well (because it's too much for one person to eat alone.)    I had them add cheese and onions to my hashbrowns, and they did a great job with those too.  Not burned, not under-cooked, just right... like goldilocks in baby bear's bed!    I look forward to taking out of town friends and family to experience this little slice of home."}
{"text":"Home cookin'. Yup, get your own hot sauce, mama's busy. Visit twice and they know your name. Visit three times and they put you to work! Can't beat the good eats. Prices reasonable. Friendly. But you need to understand that you are family and sometimes you need to wait til your cousins are served!"}
{"text":"The Best biscuits and gravy I've ever tasted and the lady that waited on me was so sweet. All in all a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade cooking, super friendly staff. They even have a \"John Wayne\" room. Great breakfasts!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot. Very clean and excellent friendly service. Typical American diner food. I especially recommend their chicken fried steak or Denver omelette."}
{"text":"Cindy's a locally owned business. The food is good, but I suggest their breakfast food. The people a very friendly. The interior does need a face lift. Feels crowded and worn out.  I recommend the country fried steak it's legit. The lunch or dinner burgers are good too. The steak sandwich is too thick and harder to eat. Taco salads can be a hit and miss. Pancakes are good and so the French toast!!  You will have fun with the waitresses they are very playful. Gary at the counter is a super cool guy. They do have a smoking section outside. Rare to see those anymore."}
{"text":"We finally stopped by here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Was pleasantly surprised by the fast seating and friendliness of our waitress Judy!  We ordered breakfast,  French toast with ham for me and my husband had chicken fried steak and eggs. The French toast was awesome as was the ham. My husband said his chicken fried steak was great. Everything was done just the way we like it. Judy was like a family member and very friendly. We will definitely be going back. Maybe tonight for fish fry!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst cafes I've ever been to. Our waiter was very rude, slammed our food on the table and just threw the receipts at us. Food was not bad, but could have been better. (my caesar salads lettuce was old, very old) The place is also very cramped up, would never come here again."}
{"text":"I have been to Cindy's about a dozen times now after a friend invited me to meet her for Sunday breakfast there. It's worth the 12 mile drive for me. I can always expect good hot decent food with a reasonable price tag.   This is not a chain, so it's difficult for the Mom & Pop places to compete with the huge discounted food orders from Sysco, so I can appreciate the quality of food they serve, what they have on special and the love shared making the delicious cinnamon buns.  While the place is quirky in terms of decor, the backs of the chairs (where most people grab) are clean. This is a huge issue to me, and tells me how often somebody takes time to scrub down the tables and chairs. (The Gilbert IHOP failed recently in this rating.)  I did not know who \"Cindy\" (the owner) was until my 3rd of 4th visit, but I see her now every time we have gone in, to check on the order, introduce herself to us, and get our feedback. This is good business for the owner to know all aspects of their service.   I would recommend Cindy's for food, service and price!   (The only reason this did not get five stars, is that I have been to 5 star restaurants all over the country. As such, the 5 stars are saved for those only.)"}
{"text":"Cozy place. Barbara, Cindy and the other staff there were very friendly. I had the western omelette w/ hash browns. I didn't take a picture of it because I was hungry and didn't feel like pulling my phone out.   Either way it was delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"Barbara was our waiter she is a jewel The food was Great ham sandwich chicken dinner   We   keep going back  no complaints"}
{"text":"Today I had the special bacon spinach omelet with home style potatoes,  it was delicious! Even on a busy Sunday morning my cup was never empty and Corrina checked on me regularly! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Whoever rated this more than 1 star must be related to this so called  mom & pop cafe.  Well if nothing else they are consistent with their most unfriendly owner (Gary) it takes everything he has to walk you to the table - never smiles or greets anyone and after he gets your money both times we were there \"never saying thank you in any way shape or form\".  The breakfast is pretty good (hash browns pretty greasy) but who can mess up eggs or toast???  It brings old and cozy to a new level - you might just say OLD and grundgy !    Putting all this aside if your looking for mediocre food, atmosphere and a miserable owner to greet you I guess you came to the right place.  The food is not mom & pop prices more like resort rates, and the little unkept, unclean restrooms are much to be desired.  I could go on and on about why I won't go back there, so don't say I didn't warn you before you try it !"}
{"text":"Was headed out for an afternoon date and just Googled to find a spot on the way - this was close and sounded good. So, decision made. We both ordered the Gary's special (eggs, hashbrowns, toast) with Country Fried steak. It was really good. The Country Fried Steak had LOADS of gravy. Usually I'm not a fan of my food floating, but it was still super good. The hashbrowns were actually BROWNED, you know like they're supposed to be (after all, they're called hashBROWNS!). Staff was super friendly. Cindy was there, herself, and even waited on us. I've since read that their Cinnamon bun is good - damned sorry I missed it. Maybe next time!  Yes, there will be a next time!!!  (ps - this is a diner, I read a few hits on Yelp for their decor.... It's a diner, it looks like a diner. It's clean and the food is good.)"}
{"text":"Always great & a super great value for your money,  I've only ever had breakfast here but would definitely like to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"My mom treated my boyfriend and me to a lunch here last weekend. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries. The burger was alright. Not amazing, but I still ate over half of it. The fries were well-seasoned... but mushy. I'm much more of a crispy french fry girl.  Then the next day my mom took me back there with two of my girlfriends. This time I ordered a Belgian waffle. It also was just alright. I'm really silly about how I eat my waffles (putting syrup in each little compartment and then cutting it up in thirds)... and the waffle I was given had a lot of holes in it, so the syrup didn't stay in.  So yeah. All-in-all, it's not awful food. I'd go back if somebody else was paying. But I'm certainly not going to find myself jonesing for their food when lunch time rolls around."}
{"text":"I love the food and the workers are amazing. Miss Barbara is amazing and the owner's daughter is very nice lady. Pleasant place to eat."}
{"text":"I go here often as I live less than a mile away and its good service and food!   I took my grandmother here recently, she loved the place as well, for me that says alot!  -shawn"}
{"text":"I love this place! We've been coming here for years while visiting Arizona and now I continue to go since moving here. This is definitely your ma and pa breakfast place so don't expect to be wine and dined and dazzled, but do expect good portions and tasty home cooked food.   I've only been here for breakfast and have sampled a bit of everything and enjoyed it all! Duly notable - as you may see from all my breakfast reviews - is their DELICIOUS and SAVORY cinnamon roll! Love it!   I usually default to an omelet of some kind. Had most of them and they've always been homemade and delicious with plenty of fillings. Typical sides are hash browns and toast, I'd recommend asking for your hash browns crispy. Sometimes they're on the lighter end.   Overall, this place is a hit. Love coming here for a bite to eat in a casual, hometown diner. It's nothing fancy or flashy but the foods always been good and the staff always polite.   Also, the coffee here is pretty good too. Ask for their homemade strawberry jam (it comes in a container with a spoon) for your toast. It's my favorite and WAY better than the little packs :D"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! Love it here! Great mom and pop place!! Good sized portions and menu has something for everyone, including my kids! I especially enjoyed their protein plate... grilled chicken, salad, cottage cheese! It was perfect!! I am so glad it is so close to our house:)"}
{"text":"Frankly, I was not impressed. I was asked \"links or patties' I chose links, I got patties.. I asked for eggs 'over easy', they were raw around the yolks even though the outside was cooked, looked like they were steamed or something... Bread / toast was below par and over buttered. Marmalade comes out in some kind of pot - why?  So, short version, I eat out a LOT in these kinds of places - and this is one where I won't be going back. Iowa Cafe just down the road blows it away."}
{"text":"If ya ain't got no ma grow'n up in these parts this is what your vittles should taste like! Look, plane and simple works here. Hot coffee, hot cakes. Fried eggs, biscuits'n gravy. And for the gentler type some pretty darn good cinnamon rolls.  Last words...Now GET!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw this rate on Yelp so I had to stop in. We were greeted and seated right away. I didn't like that the restaurant was big, but they stuffed three parties into a small area - a little awkward, but it was fine. They serve you in the correct order, everyone is friendly. The food was great! (Try the Belgian waffles). Got in, got out quick. The server was awesome too, too bad I didn't catch a name!"}
{"text":"I really dig a good ole Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner.  Unfortunately, with the corporate skullduggery muscling out the competition and brainwashing America to embrace the familiar mediocrity of preformed, seasoned sawdust, they're few and far between. I mean, if I want a microwaved meal the same 50 states over, I'd go to Applechilidennybee's. If I want some down home, from scratch, mama couldn't have made it better cookin', I'll go to Cindy's.   Being a small business, the decor is a little hokey. They're not spending money on some razzledazzle, flash and awe marketing flare. (They have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops, people! They're selling dining space for revenue! Just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin!) We sat in a room that was a shrine to John Wayne, big enough to accomodate our 8 person group. There were no less than ten pictures of The Duke. (That includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch.) And to top it all off, there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room, ensuring that double The Duke stared down at us as we ate. Weird.  But what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp bread, smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.  Everyone at the table ordered something different (from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish, Caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!  So go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to hit up some home style calorific explosions, just good breakfast times here"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this little hole in the wall. There's that homey, cozy feeling that you don't find at many places anymore. The food is good, owners and waiters and friendly and all of this for a decent price. I would definitely suggest their biscuits & gravy. They're totally delicious."}
{"text":"I've had almost everything from this restaurant is recommend it all its what you would expect from a good breakfast/lunch place"}
{"text":"Cindy's is pretty much amazing.  I love a good hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop restaurant, and that's exactly what Cindy's is. They exude a quirky, charming, whimsical ambiance, coupled with prompt, courteous, genuine service.  Staff is consistently friendly and enthusiastic; you'll be flattered by how quickly they remember your name and usual order. The true allure is their absolutely incredible food. Delicious, home-made, affordable and always served in generous proportions.  My go-to favorites are the waffles with apples on top or the chicken fried steak, but you'd be hard-pressed to find something that wasn't amazing.  Swing in and give them a try, you'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Took a friend for lunch today.  Haven't been there in several years.  When I arrived (friend already seated), was given a menu.  Waitress came asked what I wanted to drink and when see returned asked if we were ready to order.  Said we had 3 minutes (?).  Was she joking?  I asked about the broasted chicken on the website menu.  Haven't had it in several years, I was told.  My friend ordered the Lori beef sandwich and the waitress suggested a Philly with potato salad.  My friend wanted the Lori, but opt'ed for the Philly at the waitress' persistence.  The sandwich was cold.  I ordered lasagna.  I am not sure what I got.  It was a plate of tomato sauce with a couple noodles under it with maybe hamburger?  The garlic bread was half a roll cut in half with a smear of garlic butter dabbed on it, also cold.  No side salad with the pasta.  While we were eating, the waitress came back, didn't ask if we wanted anything else, refill on the tea, dessert etc. and flipped the bill on the table.  Two minutes later she returned and reached over our food to fill or take the condiments (i.e. jelly, sugar, etc.).  When we were finishing up, another person came from the kitchen picked up my plate (didn't ask if I were finished) and wanted my water glass.  The restaurant was not closing, but it seemed so.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Dis-appointment.   I've been looking for a good place for fish and chips.  Preferably all-you-can-eat.   This place was recommended to me for their fish fry on Friday.  I went there and was not impressed with the meal.  The price of $6.99 was great, but I guess you get what you pay for.  The waitstaff was average at the best. They open at 4 PM on Friday evenings, I believe I was the second table there. I was alone.  By the time the fourth party had arrived for dinner, The waitress appeared to be overwhelmed. He short time later a second waitress showed up."}
{"text":"Was just there. Service was fast and great. She New the menue-even the items that weren't on it.  Carry out. Food was great als o. Too much for me, even my partner was full!"}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot to say about Cindy's.  There is no gimmick, or \"hook\".  Just simple, good food.  The prices are average, the food is good, the bathrooms are nice, what more do you want?  Okay, let's talk about atmosphere--the decor is very late-80's Arizona and it may have been a little warm in the restaurant, but that may have been just me.   The owner and staff are very, very, nice, and if I lived in Mesa, this would probably be my weekend breakfast spot.  I will say the coffee was very weak.  Will I go back?  Absolutely.  There is nothing wrong with Cindy's-I just won't order the coffee."}
{"text":"This is right in my neighborhood. I enjoy going here anytime and the owner,Cindy is a great lady and real nice person who takes pride to make sure you enjoyed your meal. They do all the things on their menu well. I mostly have been there for breakfast and lunch. No matter when I go there if there is a wait it is not long. It is nice to find a place that almost feels homey and pleasant to go to and that if you go there long enough they get to know you and know what you like. To me it is more than just another dinner. I enjoy going some where besides chain food places that are more individual."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of this place I knew I had to try it. One Sunday morning I got the urge to go and as I was driving west on McKellips, my mind raced and I realized at some time long, long ago I had eaten here with my mom. After all it's only a mile from her house, my childhood home, otherwise known as the ghettO - northwest Mesa.   The decor is pretty funny and cooky but the place is clean and I like how they have little alcoves with a few tables in each. It makes it feel more private.   I got the pastrami and fries. I thought the fries were excellent and the sourdough bread was literally dripping with butter. I thought it was quite tasty. However my dining partner took a bite and said the meat tasted like sub par crap deli meat and that it wasn't that good. Oh well. I thought it was pretty good but it was very, very greasy.   Our waitress was attentive for how busy it was. The patio is huge and nice but unfortunately it's all smoking. Well, that could be fortunate if you're a smoker."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Mesa, just down the road from Cindy's Arizona Cafe. We have had breakfasts and lunches here. The menu has a lot of standard fare, as well as some treats one doesn't find elsewhere.  For example -- gyro meat as a breakfast meat choice. Fantastic! Also, they make french toast from cinnamon roll (bread). You MUST try that! Also, they make a Monte Cristo sandwich. The only other place around here that I know of which serves a Monte Cristo is Chompies. The one from Cindy's is simple yet fun -- ham and turkey breast (I think, or could have been pork -- I need to ask!) with cheese on french toast. Divine!  The food has been fabulous home-cooked fare and the staff is sweet and attentive. It is often busy, but the wait has never been too long. They are absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast place.  Better than some, not as good as others.  Minor issue (or major depending on perspective) they brought burnt toast to the table.  Also, chicken fried steak (breakfast version) was rather small. Not quite a 3"}
