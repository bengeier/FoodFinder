{"text":"Spécialités Syriennes, Libanaises et Arméniennes.

Sans doute le meilleur kebe neye que j'ai jamais dégusté. Monsieur Ghassan est un hôte incroyable. Un cuisine familiale. Tout est délicieux."}
{"text":"My favourite Syrian restaurant in Montreal. I'm Syrian and I can assure you the food is as authentic as it could get. The Armenian salad (with the sumac spice), the fatouche salad, the kababs and the kebeh neyeh are excellent. Some might say that it's a bit overpriced but that's because they're used to fast food lebanese/syrian cuisine. This is a family-runned business. They make you feel as though you're a guest in their home while they prepare your  food. They use fresh ingredients and nothing is already prepared so it gives you the liberty to customize your order."}
{"text":"The food here is top of the line yummy! Got to try this place if you want some tasty Middle eastern food. Go for the grillades."}
