{"text":"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Amazing value for money, great Portuguese food.

Great chicken, and the rice is amazing.

A half chicken dinner, with a mountain of rice and potatoes is under 12 dollars. 

I am yet to try their sandwiches, but they look great."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place about a year ago and I'll be honest, I am utterly in love with it.  It serves Portuguese-style rotisserie chicken, but also has pork chops, fried fish, thermidor, baked (?) rice and many other food items that mostly look as good as they taste.

The item that most impresses me is the pita wrap.  I normally don't ever order sandwiches when I eat out, considering $8-12 an outrageous price for a bit of bread, a tiny bit of meat and 25 cents worth of vegetables, but this place's chicken wraps are truly something special.  They're not too cheap (about $8 after tax), but they are filled to the brim with very fresh tasting chicken chunks, often with the skin still attached (and thus more moist and tender than the chicken breast cubes used in so many wraps of this ilk).  The sauce is delicious, and the balance of ingredients and flavours is so good that I even devour all the onions inside, even though I usually hate onions.

I've tried several other items available.  The fried fish is excellent, softer and more moist inside, but with flavour, and the batter is both crispy and light, a real rarity.  Their rice is so tasty it could be its own meal, and they give huge portions -- stick with the small; even I can't finish all of it in one meal.  The only sub-par item is the beef; despite looking excellent, it suffers from lying under the heat lamp and is tough and dry.

The seating is pretty poor, but as the hordes of customers will tell you, the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"I am not a peaky person but the chicken in the sandwich was dry. Service was not good. If there is someone who has never been to your place, make sure you explain to the person so that the person becomes your customer next time. I should have gone to Pizza Pizza. I don't recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Large portions for a good price.  I can can 2-3 meals out of a single order."}
{"text":"Why might you ask is Swiss Chalet still in business? It's because there isn't a Swiss Chalet next door. 

Amazing and extremely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very solid chicken. Cannot go wrong. Get the half chicken with rice and broccoli. Or switch it up. Just don't forget hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I second everything Erin said, except that I've never like Swiss Chalet (sorry).

I'll just add the following:

- they'll swath your chicken with hot sauce if you ask them too
- I like the grilled chicken more than the rotisserie chicken (although it's dryer the next day - and yes, you'll probably have left overs)
- the little potato balls are great (okay, erin said that too. But it's especially true.)"}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try this place so I stopped in. The old man who works at the counter was pretty rude and crusty to start off with  but having worked in the service industry, I let it go.

Having a tomato allergy, I asked if it was ok if I had the greek salad with no tomatoes in it and if a couple fell in, I just wouldn't eat them. This became an issue and he started putting in all tomatoes. I thought ok maybe it's a language barrier so I'll try again, then I tried again to communicate with him about it. Eventually, I asked for help from another lady working the counter. She was pretty clear with him and I thought ok great we are going somewhere...nope.

At that point, I just left with no food. What was the point, the man was so rude that I just didn't want to eat there anymore."}
{"text":"I was expecting moist and succulent Portuguese roasted chicken after reading Yelp reviews, especially since that seems to be their specialty, but what I got was nothing close to that. Yes, the half chicken dinner was indeed dirt cheap, but I don't think I will be coming back again. It was just so dry that it was hard to swallow and almost choked. The potatoes, however, were good though. If you plan on ordering the chicken, make sure you order a drink or two to help you wash it down. Trust me, you'll need it.

Also I don't understand why a Portuguese place is also selling Moussaka and Lasagna. I don't think those menu items are Portuguese."}
{"text":"Good food and quantity but the service and venue could use some work. The chicken was moist and well grilled, the potatoes were done perfectly and the rice was fresh. However there was not much flavor in the chicken and the hot sauce was as someone else said just Frank's Red Hot diluted. I despise it when restaurants do this, wing joints do this as well for their \"hot\" flavor and I'm tired of downing salty wanna be hot sauce. The portions were huge for the price which was great but  that can't make up for a less than clean eating area and shoddy service.
 
There were only two large tables available outside one of which was occupied by an employee with her feet up on the chair chatting obnoxiously on her cell phone while having her lunch. All while customers were lined up out the door and some waiting for somewhere to sit. I was rushed by the people at the counter and they were definitely not friendly. When  I did manage to get a seat outside the chatty employee was still there talking so loud I had trouble continuing a conversation at my own table. This was followed by another employee coming outside and having an argument with her about scheduling followed by me having to fend-off a cat that jumped up on the table to eat my food. I think next time I'll just do take out because the food really wasn't that bad. 

Anyway that was my experience, but I will visit again if I'm in the mood for pigging out on Portuguese chicken. Note: There is an extra charge for debit."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, half chicken dinner used to be $10 now they made it $12. Today I visit this location to find out they are now charging $1 extra for another hot sauce which always used to be free until now. The owner is very cheap and should consider changing this before he loses his loyal regular customers. Also, the old
name was better wtf I'm eating chicken not red rooster."}
{"text":"Went here once, had a chicken sandwich. It was roast chicken, lettuce, and mayo on a fresh Portuguese bun. Not sophisticated, but just what I was expecting. Abundant tasty chicken, reasonable price, and yes, cramped tables."}
{"text":"This is the place my neighbors told me to hit up on my first night in the neighborhood, and I've gone back more times than I can count in the past year. Sardinha is a lifesaver on those nights when you get off the subway and just want to pick up something for dinner that requires no work on your part, and head home.

For a single person, a half chicken is the perfect deal - for around 5 bucks you can have dinner tonight and one or two sandwiches for later (and if you're ambitious, you can use the carcass to make stock!).  If you're looking for a more rounded meal (or are too lazy to make your own side dish) you can get a chicken dinner for under ten bucks that includes your choice of rice with veggies or potato balls (or both).  They always have some inexpensive portugese pada style buns at the register for cheap.  

Other delish dishes include fried fillet of sole, as well as a few other main dishes.  I'll be honest though, I always get the chicken.  When they ask, try saying yes to the hot sauce - live a little - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"my wife and I always come here and split the half chicken dinner.  the portions are huge so we just split one meal.  the Piri Piri sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Sardinha Rei Dos Frangos is truly the king of chicken! I've been to many churrasqueria joints in this town but none can compare to this place. I've met people here that travel from all over the city to get themselves some roasted birds and I can understand why.  I hit it up last night after a characteristically tedious shopping trip to Ikea and, I gotta say, there's nothing like some roasted chicken to pick up my mood. Just walking into the place had me smiling. This place is spotless, the chicken is always fresh and you really can't beat the price. They were about to close so I bought whatever they had left: 3 legs and a container of potatoes and rice was all of 8 bucks. This has got to be one of the best deals in town. I couldn't fit it all into my hollow legs so I saved some chicken and rice to make a stir-fry today. Hail to the King!"}
{"text":"Good food. Cheap. Plentiful. And less than $10 for chicken dinner.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Their chicken is incredible. It's even worth stopping here if you need a pre-cooked chicken for a recipe - theirs are worlds better than the ones at Metro.  As for the meals themselves, they're tasty and enormous, easily enough to feed two people (or one person twice)."}
{"text":"I like the chicken sandwiches here. Last night when they were closing and mopping up I slipped and fell on my ass pretty hard. Hurt...but I got a free sandwich. Pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Un excellent restaurant portugais avec du poulet grillé de grande qualité, des filets de poisson et tout ce que vous voudrez en accompagnement. Vous pouvez manger sur place mais la très grande majorité y passe pour des plats à emporter."}
{"text":"We had the chicken it was good but found that the chicken from College st much better. The potatoes where just a bit under cooked, the rice was great most and very tasty . The service was perfect super fast very friendly ."}
{"text":"Decent roast chicken; Not the best in the city.  Other dishes are greasy, cafeteria-like fare and not worth the bother.  The chicken sandwich is actually a pretty good value - simple- fresh and tasty.  As mentioned in other reviews, the service is uneven and punctuated by seemingly random acts of favoritism.  It's almost better, well more democratic, when there's a crowd."}
{"text":"Very good portion sizes and price.  The chicken tasted good but I've had better in the area.  The biggest pull for me is the low prices and large portion sizes."}
{"text":"This was unexpected.
This place looked a little worse for the wear, and actually not really inviting for a dining spot. They didn't speak much English, and luckily my companion was a Francophone. For as off-putting the dingy environs were, the counter held yummy-looking stuff, and the SMELL was incredible. I realized this was an Anthony Bourdain Shithole that Tony hadn't been to yet. The specialty of the house appeared to be Chicken, in the style that is germane to the State of Sinaloa in Mexico. We have a shitload of joints that serve this here in Chicago. Marinated in citrus and chilli, finshed over Charcoal, it's a grand feed. Here's whats weird: this Mexican-style Chicken was served alongside some Mideastern stuff. Whaaa?
You stand in line (which moves quickly) and get your stuff on a tray. If you're lucky you get a seat. We did, and the food was really really fine. Delicious.
I have to menchen another aspect of this place. I had to answer a call of nature, and was sent down a ridiculously steep flight of rickety stairs, and I must have been close to the Earths core, 'cos it was hotter than hell in the basement where the bogs were located. When I got there, the room was tiny and weird. Can't say why, just weird.
A unique feed, for sure."}
{"text":"Growing up, everyone I knew was aware and fond of the local \"chicken place\" not too far from home (Royce Dupont). Back then, we never referred to it as Portuguese BBQ nor churrasqueira. It was simply the \"chicken place\" that everyone loved to claim was \"better than Swiss Chalet\".

These-a-days, it seems that the churrasqueiras are growing in popularity, almost to a trendy level... and I don't get it.

Some beefs I have about Portuguese chicken restaurants and reasons I think they're popular:

1. Since when do they douse the chicken with Frank's Red Hot sauce? Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff, but I am convinced that this new trend of saucing-the-bird is in part responsible for their growing popularity. If you read any list of reviews on any churrasqueira, you'll see a good chunk of them will include statements like \"oooh, you gotta try the hot sauce, it sooo addicting and yummy ;)\". Have those people ever had a buffalo wing??? Also, it's \"addictive\", not \"addicting\".

2. Since when is cooking a spinning chicken in a convention (or even convection) oven considered BBQ? It's just roast chicken! And I can make it at home. How can they claim to be king of something that they don't even serve?

3. It's ridiculously cheap. I'm tired of following raving reviews to find sub-par food just because of the cost-for-quantity ratio. I must learn to pay attention to any place that has a review that says anything like \"and you get two meals in one for only 6 dollars!\" I'd rather pay double for a meal that is worth traveling for as opposed to paying a pittance for dry chicken, a heap of flavourless rice and 3 pounds of average potatoes. (I guess that last sentence was my review).

I was duped again by the lure of the cost-influenced reviews. Dang."}
{"text":"I mentioned that I went here to some folks in the neighbourhood and they were very excited to hear my opinion...unfortunately though, I didn't have anything good to say. The person who served me (possibly the owner) pretty much mumbled the whole time. I had a half chicken and declined the hot sauce. I do notice all the mentions about the hot sauce and maybe I regret not going for that, but what I really could have used was chalet sauce. The white meat was super-dry...really not what I was expecting from a \"specialty\" chicken place that looks like it's been around for a while. Have to say this was super disappointing.

The potatoes were good though."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. so much food for so little money! Now that I'm living closer to this chicken lovers dream I know I'll be here a lot. 

I mostly love their sides too. The dill peas are so killer. I have no idea what is in them but I want more and I kinda want them right now.

If you're feeling too lazy to cook but want a home cooked meal hit this place up and thank me later."}
{"text":"Delicious, tasty, cheap, yummy! Yes, three adjectives describing the taste. 

We always get chicken from here whenever I am visiting a friend who lives in the area. As the other reviewers have noted, definitely get the hot sauce. But we also always get the chicken oil. We are not 100% what this actually is, but we like it."}
{"text":"Yum! Just so yummy. You will wonder why you are getting chicken anywhere else.

Say yes to hot sauce. 

Wear walking shoes, because there's only a small counter and patio and you should probably just take it right to the subway and straight home. 

Lots of interesting sides. Everything looks super-fresh. Current favourite is parisienne potatoes. They won't make fun of you for Calli games them potato balls. 

Right at the Delaware exit of Ossington subway stop."}
{"text":"Great roast chicken. The potatoes were excellent, full of flavour and a perfect accompaniment to the chicken.  Unbelievable prices.  There was a line up at the counter the entire time we were eating there.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff are always very friendly and never fail to give me extra hot sauce. The chicken is always cooked to perfection and the sides are delicious as well. It's always busy but the service is fast and you won't have to wait for long. The combos are a steal of a deal and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast, affordable, healthy food - gigantic portions and friendly staff. The menu says you can only have 2 sides, but they'll give you more than that, just less of a portion, but the same amount is weight/food. They always have different things available, each time I go in - different options than my previous visit. 

Very blue collar, Portuguese style fast food - it's amazing. I wish they made their own Piri Piri, though."}
{"text":"SRDF is easily the best bang for your buck chicken place in the whole Toronto. Half chicken dinner comes out to be $9.95 INCLUDING tax. WOW. They used to use the white take out boxes but they switched to using circular tin containers which are much better at retaining heat. It's fun watching them stuff the box with rice and potatoes because you're wondering how they are going to make space for the chicken when the box is so full already. To my surprise, they fit a decent sized halfed chicken into the box somehow...I'm stunned! 

Taste wise, I still like the Churassco Villa ner Mount Pleasant/Eglinton better. Price and portion wise SRDF wins hands down. There's easily enough food for 2 people. The potatoes are not as delicious as other places but still highly passable. The rice is just fine. Their piri piri sauce is pretty good. 

The only reason I don't visit this place frequently is because it's far from my house. But occasionally I make excuses to come to this area."}
{"text":"OMG... Seriously. The cook went and took the two carpets from the inside, and shook off the dirt upwind from the diners in the patio area. Then, he went back to cutting up chicken without washing his hands. 

I've been a regular here, but no more. Their food isn't amazing, but tolerable at the price point, but this disgusting act did it for me. 

I'll go elsewhere where I think (hope) their employees wash their hands after doing cleaning work. Be warned, dine there at your own peril. (I'd give this place negative stars if possible.)"}
{"text":"Another dishonest merchant, twice they cut off (steal) the thigh portion of a 1/2 chicken take out which i found out when i got home, I mean how low can you get?
 Most of the time the chicken is dried out. Will not go back for sure."}
{"text":"I usually pick a whole chicken up with Parisienne potatoes. Not a bad price ~14 for a whole chicken alone. But they're pretty small. My boyfriend can finish their whole chicken in one sitting, and he's an average sized guy. 

Definitely tastes better than your local Walmart/Metro rotisserie chicken!"}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken ever. I've been going there forever now, I've tried other Portuguese rotisserie and there's nothing as good as this place."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't look that great, the queue to line up doesn't make sense as it abruptly turns, the menu is in a place that you can see it when you walk in, but if you are lining up you might go under it and then can't see it.

However, the chicken is good and cheap. For just a little more than your Wal-Mart/No-Frills chicken, you get something a lot better. And the hot sauce is hot for me, but it's so tasty. I did find the chicken breast a bit dry though, someone else said this is hit and miss.

Also said by ScottM is why there is Portuguese chicken and things like Moussaka (Greek)? That doesn't make sense to me.

Nevertheless, for a quick dinner I'd stop by here in a heartbeat to get a good meal. The potato balls are great too, that's because they fried!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in all Portuguese restaurants in Toronto but this place is one of the best, good  customer service, the food is always fresh and very good prices."}
{"text":"Blechhhhh!!! This is maybe the worst food I have had in a while. Wanted to try the chicken, ordered a white quarter. Lady up sold me on the combo: big oval plate, piled high with the potatoes and chick pea salad I chose. The potatoes were disgusting: way over cooked to the extent it was impossible to get a mouthful using their flimsy plastic forks. The chick pea salad was just bland. The chicken was also over cooked: dry white meat that fell apart when I pushed it with the flimsy plastic fork. Put some hot sauce on it, basically Frank's Red Hot in a greasy squeeze bottle. I ate maybe 10% of the total food. 

Again, bleeeeecccchhhh!!! I'm never going back to this nasty, inept joint slinging a random selection of badly prepared trash."}
{"text":"Second time here and I was very happy and had a very full belly.  They have large portions and very popular with the locals.  Couldn't figure out if it was Greek or Portuguese but it's really both and neither.  Go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"The Rooster Rotisserie and Grill is a counter style restaurant specializing in Portuguese style barbecued chicken.  The restaurant is TECHNICALLY accessible, in the sense that a wheelchair or mobility device could probably get through the door but the doorway isn't the biggest and the space in front of the counter is often crowded.  I was unable to get to the bathroom due to the crowd, so I can't speak to it in terms of accessibility or being gendered.

If you show up during the dinner rush at the Rooster, be prepared to wait.  The place is set up as such; there's a big counter that starts with salads and sides.  If you want a sandwich or salad or side dish, you pick them here.  I wasn't a huge fan of the sides, but it seems like lots of people REALLY like those potato balls.  After sides, you order your main, be it chicken, fish, gyros or something else.  When you get to the end of the line, you leave and try to make your way through the crowd.

WHAT I DO LIKE IS THE CHICKEN!  My spouse is the pickiest eater ever.  He doesn't like Portuguese chicken from Montreal because of the spices, he doesn't like Saint-Hubert barbecue chicken because of the flavor, but he likes the Rooster.  I got a massive chicken for 12$, taxes in.  It was delicious and I will return!"}
{"text":"The Rooster, which up until somewhat recently was called Sardinia, makes me break all my food rules. I always order the chicken breast rotisserie chicken dinner. For starters, I don't like meat with bones in it but since that's the only way to get rotisserie chicken I make an exception. The chicken is delicious and juicy and the piri piri sauce is a must! Secondly, I don't normally eat white rice or potatoes but I usually end up getting  both since I don't have the luxury of having The Rooster very often (I used to live in the area so I'd get it all the time with healthier sides, but I digress) My personal recommendation is for the tomato potatoes which are roasted and delicious, but you can't go wrong with the lemon potatoes or even the fried potatoes. Service is quick even though this wee little corner place is always super busy, so busy in fact if you get there after 7 your side choices can sometimes be rather limited since they make everything fresh. Cops love it here and there's often officers lining up to get their Rooster on. This place gets bonus points for always making Bloor/Delaware smell like hot sauce. Minimal seating, so get it to go unless you enjoy eating in cramped tiny places."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. The chicken was dry and the food was mediocre. Potatoes were decent but didn't really have flavor."}
{"text":"This place is very popular and seems to have people jammed into its little space every time I happen to walk by. When it first opened I was a vegetarian and we would order it from work now and again. I used to just get the rice and little potato balls, but they tasted like chicken! So it's certainly not a good veggie recommendation.

Now I eat meat again so I go all out and order the half chicken with rice and potatoes and I think it comes to less than 10 dollars? Not a bad deal and very filling. The rice is tasty. They have other things like lasagna but you're likely better off sticking with what they're known for."}
{"text":"I think this churrasqueira chicken place, The Rooster on Bloor (what used to be called Sardinha) is probably among the best on Earth. Every night there is a massive line-up. It's one of the busiest in the neighbourhood and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss.

Some days the chickens are of decent size, deliciously succulent and juicy and the potatoes are nice and crispy.  

Some days the chickens are tiny and dry and the potatos taste obviously frozen and soggy.  The rice is always bland, but nothing a little hot sauce can't perk up.

The employees can be a little surley but I don't blame them. It's always so hot and crowded in here. There is always a line-up. Not as good as the joints on college street (imo) but it'll do the trick if you're in the mood for portuguese chicken. Also pretty cheap so that's a plus.  3 and a half stars."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, with has pretty standard Portuguese fare. It's especially good for a family meal, which was why I came here. However after my last time here, which I will detail below I'm not coming back.

Went in on a Monday night. Please was busy, as usual. Two police getting their order. I was next in line. I was looked over by the older gentleman with blue eyes, who proceeded to ask the person behind me for his order. I looked at the guy behind me, who had 'jumped the line' and we shared a look - mine basically saying 'WTF', the other guy smiling oddly. I told him to 'go ahead'. 

I listened as the older man with blue eyes asked the guy who was now getting his order before me where he was from, telling him he looked Spanish; in Spanish. The guy told the old man he was Mexican. I might not look it, but I speak and understand Spanish. Because I'm just not Spanish looking enough I won't be coming back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Like, 4 stars good.

Unfortunately the slow service is keeping my review at a solid three stars. I came during the dinner rush and found the line to be about 5 people deep. I figured the line would move quickly as they had 5+ staff working in this small location. In reality the serving process was tedious as they only had one person serving customers.

By the time I got through the line it had grown to 8-10 people long and no one behind the counter seemed to care or offer to give the poor woman serving up dishes a hand."}
{"text":"This place is just friggin' ridiculous.  It's not the best Portuguese-style roasted chicken I've had (that honour belongs to Romados - but it applies the same philosophy of ridiculous portions for dirt cheap.)  But the first clue to its lack of flavour is that nearly everyone doused the chicken heavily with what tastes like diluted Frank's Red Hot.

But ya - so I ordered a 1/2 chicken dinner - which comes with a choice of two sides.  So I pick the rice and point at a random pasta salad as I'm too hungry to really care.  The lady is filling up my styrofoam takeout tray and asks, \"Why didn't you pick the roasted potato?  You don't like potato?\"

Bit of an odd question, but I stammer back, \"Sure - I like potatoes\"

She then asks if I would like to try some (my tray is already heavy with rice and salad) and she heaps on a huge helping of potatoes before I can firmly answer one way or the other.  Slap on my half chicken and a generous squirt of hot sauce and you have the best bang-for-buck meal I've seen in Toronto so far.  $9 for enough food to feed a family -- and I'm not exaggerating - I saw a couple and their two kids eating out of one tray.

My takeout tray was so full, I had to eat at the limited tables they have for fear of have the contents of my fat and carb box exploding while in transport.  So I ate and since I was sitting and eating anyways - I decided I was going to have my meal in the restaurant.

So I eat... and eat... and eat.  I am a heavy-set man (read: 'fat bastard') and even starting hitting the wall about 1/3 of the way through the box.  So I packed it up and wandered home in a food daze carrying what would pass for a full meal at other places.

The chicken was pretty moist and definitely a cut above Swiss Chalet - but it really not fantastic chicken (come on - the hot sauce pretty 'meh' and a cover-up IMO).  But boy, is this place cheap."}
{"text":"Chicken is dry and not cheap, no idea why it's popular, maybe it's the history, do not bother trying."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This is a fantastic take-out joint.  For $9 and change you can get a half chicken with a huge portion of rice and potatoes.  Seriously, when they hand you the container you will wonder why it weighs so much!  It makes two meals, and you will still have potatoes and/or rice left over.  

The chicken is very tasty (get it spicy as long as you can handle a little bit of spice).  Actually, it is all very tasty.  Great value."}
{"text":"Great and simple store that I frequented when I lived in the area, and make a point to visit now that I live a bit further. They have different things daily (when I went I saw fried fish, something like brisket, chicken jambalaya) but I've always gone for the rotisserie chicken. It was the first place I've ever had churrasqueira and it definitely sparked my love for the juicy portuguese dish. 

The quarter chicken dinner with 2 sides would be a pretty hefty meal for $9. I always get the hot sauce (although I don't think it's very unique) and Chickpeas as a side. 

Tip: get the tzatziki. You pay extra for a tiny container but it's the thickest tzatziki I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very greasy food, rude staff, and the food is sometimes made one day and served the next. I know that because I can taste that it's not fresh. The prices have gone up like crazy. Over 11 bucks now for the Portuguese chicken combo. Used to be 8 bucks just a few years back. The food gave me diarrhea and I felt sick a few times eating there. Would not recommend unless you are very desperate and hungry for something."}
{"text":"this place is gross stay away i used to be a regular here when it was Sardinha but they seem to be trying to cut cost as of lately. I ordered the potato balls today and you could clearly tell they were old leftovers from the night before or worse... they were not eatable; the potatos were shriveled up wrinkled due to loss of moisture.... old age you could tell... very disappointing because this used to be my go to spot to get chicken and there signature potato ball. never again stay clear..."}
{"text":"Gord and I got chicken dinners from The Rooster Rotisserie and Grill.  I've walked by it many times and have wanted to check them out.  I got our dinners to go.

We both got half chicken dinners.  Gord got his with salad and coleslaw.  He really liked it and said he'd get it again.

I got mine with rice and Parisian potatoes.  I had them put the sauce on mine (rather than on the side).  The sauce had a bit of kick but I liked it.  I too enjoyed my meal and would get it again.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to visited this place, I found out that the service is good, and the chicken is perfect , especially with pasta salad and potato ball. I will want to visit again ."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. 

It's not the best churasqueria in Toronto, but it's high up their in terms of an easy in the area meal. The chicken can be a little over cooked depending on time of day and turnover, but at that price, it's a little expected. The portions are really exceptional here so beware of that. My first time i ordered wayyy to much. 


Why i like it over other places is because it's not just chicken - they have a larger protein selection like ribs, fish, etc. Makes for great takeout."}
{"text":"Oh, Sardinah you make my heart happy! I'm so fortunate to have you so close to me... gotta try it ya'll! Don't forget the hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man.  Out of chicken for the fourth time.in a row.  They had 12 but said they were reserved for Pickup in 20 mins.  Guy tells me chicken will be ready in 15.  Refuses to explain why he can't just give the reservation one of the new ones, unless he is lying about the time.  He refuses to answer me, curses me under his breath, and goes to the back.  

Will DEFINETLY not be returning as this, combined with the terrible service and downturn in food quality makes it no longer worth the effort.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I stop here quite often on my way home from the gym to grab dinner to take home.

The food is pretty good. It´s a little bit pricey for take out. You do get a large portion however, but a half rotisserie chicken with two sides comes to $11 with tax and some of the other take out dinners are even more. Should really cost $9 or $10 for takeout. 

The chicken is okay, as others mentioned its a bit inconsistent, sometimes a bit dry. 

Also the employees can be a little crotchety and basically seem unhappy to be working, not all of them but every day I go there is at least one really grumpy seeming person. I asked for the broccoli salad once and the guy gave me a side of broccoli instead, when I corrected him he became very irritated.

Overall it´s okay but I mainly go here for the convenience as it just happens to be located on my path home."}
{"text":"Yummy Portuguese home-style take-out. Lunch deals, fresh salads and you can buy whole chickens!"}
{"text":"I am on quest to find the best Portuguese chicken in the Toronto area. I decided to give this place a try after seeing it while on a TTC bus. I arrived to order their half chicken dinner with 2 sides, total came out to $9.95 including tax. The meal came in a circular tin container.

Review of the chicken
The chicken is nothing special, just your typical rotisserie chicken, the meat was a little too dry compared to the other Portuguese chicken places I have tried.

The potatoes were ok, lacked flavor but I liked it because it wasn't too greasy.

The rice was surprisingly good though, lots of flavour.

The hot sauce tasted like it was commercially made, nothing special.

Overall I give this place a 3 because of the extremely large portions, and somewhat decent meal. I wouldn't go out of my way again to eat here but if I am in the area I would give this place a try again."}
{"text":"Very delicious food here!  The chicken is delicious and always very moist, the hot sauce is to die for.  I could put that tangy sauce on just about everything I eat!!!  The potatoes are perfect and the rice is delicious too.  This place is cheap and delicious.  Great catering costs too!  Also, fresh and delicious natas."}
{"text":"I was hungry when I was strolling along Bloor Street and I got more hungry when I walked by Sardinha Rei Dos Frangos and saw all the chicken roasting and cooking on the grill!

Looking at the menu through the window and I saw Quarter Leg ($3.10) and with enough change in my pocket, I knew what I were going to snack on.

Nice lady put my chicken in the bag and drowned it with hot sauce even before I have a chance to tell her I want to eat that here! So I was enjoying my chicken which was really tender and juicy (Yay! Dark Meat!!), watching people lining up for take out... Curiously, almost all of them were male!!

I smelled like Chicken after eating the chicken since Sardinha has open kitchen and I guess smelling like chicken was not too bad!"}
