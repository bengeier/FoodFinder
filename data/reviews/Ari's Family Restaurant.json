{"text":"Very impressed by this place first time we came for brunch. Had the gyro omelet and coffee. my husband had the steak/ eggs/ potatos/ toast. All very delicious and good price for the meal!  Thanks Ari's Family Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with mom and grandma. This is a small restaurant, but clean and bright. Loved the service, waitress was so friendly. Not the best options for vegetarians, but I managed to find a Greek salad with poppyseed dressing and onion rings. Food was nice and hot, generous portions. Mom ordered chicken Parmesan, large and tender chicken with the perfect amount of cheese. grandma ordered veal cutlet, nice and tender, good mashed potatoes. Onion rings were perfectly cooked, nice and hot. Greek salad was large, with fresh veggies, good olives and a ton of delicious feta cheese. The real star was the poppyseed dressing. Sweet, sour, and stunning, this is apparently a house favorite and for good reason.  Server was Kelly, incredibly friendly and quick. Some of the best food I've had in the town, and the best service by far.  The only reason that I am putting four stars instead of five is due to lack of vegetarian options. Get a few more meatless entrees, and I will bump it up to five in a heartbeat. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. Don't miss out on this little gem!"}
{"text":"The place is quite small and really vintage looking. The waitress was really friendly and the restaurant is just a little neighborhood diner. Definitely not for kids because it's filled with mostly old timers that were probably coming here since a long time ago. All I want to say is hands down the BEST grilled cheese sandwich I have ever eaten! Def a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, friendly helpful staff. Great place to sit and relax and have a great meal.  Will come back every time we come to Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I had to for this one. It was probably the worst breakfast meal I've heard had. I don't even know how it's possible to mess up breakfast but I had the Ari's Diner Special.   The eggs were soggy, the home-fries tasted awful, the toast was so hard I couldn't break it.   My boyfriend and I just ate our pancakes, not great but consumable, and that's it.   We wanted to try a new place but I highlight recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thought twice about giving this place a shot, the night before when we rode by, there were only two cars in their lot (found out this morning that they close at 8:00)! Stopped in here late in the morning for a breakfast before leaving town and they were a very pleasant surprise! I ordered the Chopped Steak and Eggs (OM) and Hash Browns with a side order of Two Pancakes with Ham Slice! The Eggs were cooked perfectly, the chopped steak was very well seasoned and cooked medium as I requested! Pancakes were large, fluffy and golden on BOTH sides, just what I look for in real pancakes cooked on flat top! My wife ordered the Corned Beef and Swiss Omelet, she said the corned beef was also tasty, well seasoned and the omelet cooked perfectly! Only negative, only slightly, is the hash browns not seasoned and could have been cooked through a little longer, we both ate them all though! So glad we stopped in, the meal held me over the whole 5 hour drive home!"}
{"text":"What a divy surprise.  It is what I want to see when I want a cross between a diner and family cafe.  Perfect.  The prices are surprisingly low but the quality will catch you by surprise.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs.  Under 5 bucks.  I was expecting the canned stuff.  I was wrong.  They use the shredded potato hash browns, onion and meaty chunks of corned beef.  Two eggs perfectly cooked, toast.  $4.99.    Pancakes the wife had were spot on.  If i were a local, this might be my go to place."}
{"text":"Good food, better price! Small but fulfilling breakfast menu. Tiny little venue on Lorain but plenty of group seating available (with a wait)"}
{"text":"Have gone to this place several times. Has not dissapointed. If you want that old school diner feel this place is for you. It's not fancy nor extravagant but if your looking for home cooked breakfast at very fair prices you've found the spot. Highly recommended. Service has been great every visit so far."}
{"text":"This is our first time eating at Ari's. Have passed it most of my life but never visited. I had the 3 eggs bacon home fries and toast while my hubby had the corned beef hash with poached eggs. Both meals were excellent. Coffee was hot without scalding your mouth. It's a small diner type place with what seems like lots of regulars. We may just be one of those!!!  Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Eggplant   Parmesan I've ever had !    The salad was fresh and the Balsamic Vinigaret  dressing was just right. Fast service."}
{"text":"Listen. Here's the deal with this place. No frills, no foofy phoney baloney elaborate menu, and no great presentation. Just good, clean, straight forward, you get what you order food! Everybody? wants to be entertained by their food these days. Not here. The menu is simple and they should keep it that way. The decor is dated, and they should not touch a thing. The place is clean, and I hope they just keep doing what they are doing.   My husband had a 3 hotcakes breakfast with eggs and choice of meat. The pancakes were nicely done. Simple, but perfect. He got scrambled eggs with sausage links. Easy peasy and he was happy. He loved the coffee. He got three refills, took a cup to go, and the waitress treated it like a refill without charging the to-go coffee. Only thing - no Splenda. No problem. I carry some with me.  I got a chef's salad with ranch dressing. They serve the dressing on the side. I tried it once, but ate the salad without the dressing because IT WAS THAT GOOD PLAIN!! Yes, the meat had flavor, wasn't dry, two types of cheese, and the egg was perfect. I didn't need dressing.   The service was fantastic. Our server was a salty local woman who I wouldn't mess with for a thousand dollars. But she was at the same time sweet as hell, cares about her customers and great at what she does.  This place gets 5 stars, not because it is 5 star dining. It is just simply the best at what it is. An old school diner. Please don't change a thing."}
{"text":"This is a nice but basic restaurant to have breakfast.  They do what they do best. I had the three eggs,hashbrows, toast and gyro meat combo. The best part about the place is that it is old school.  I will come back again.."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here since I was little. Ari (who recently passed away) was the sweetest man on the planet. This restaurant loves all walks of life and has the best diner breakfast food."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices.   The breakfast here is consistently good.  It can be crowded at times, but the staff is nice and they handle it well."}
{"text":"Cozy, no frills, family owned diner. It may not be immaculate but they make a decent home style breakfast. Service is nice and efficient. The best part of the dish is the potato hash which was slightly crispy and buttery. The toast was not overdone, just slightly toasted with just the right amount of butter. Place is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Small, easy to miss on the street side, but the food was very good.  Service was friendly but the inside of the place is old and run-down, albeit clean."}
{"text":"This place epitomizes an American neighborhood diner. There are lots of locals who come in every day and order \"the usual.\" The waitresses are very efficient and friendly (to strangers too). The booths and counter seats are pretty comfortable and resemble any photos of diners you've seen. Prices are reasonable.   The menu is relatively limited: (1) various combinations of eggs, bacon, and toast; (2) different omelettes; (3) oatmeal, hot cakes, etc. My husband liked his veggie omelette meal, and my home fries were exactly as they should be. Our waitress kept our coffee and tea filled.   Overall, a good experience that lives up to expectations."}
{"text":"How do I give this place zero stars? We called ahead for a party of 9-10, when we arrived we were greeted with shock!!! We were \"reminded\" several times that \"We close at 8PM\" and then the waitress stated several times she had \"other stuff to do.'  She did not even offer us drinks!!!!  We went up the street to Cafe Stratos where we were greeted with a smile and welcomed our large party with no notice.  Pass this place up and head over to Cafe Stratos!!!      You have been warned."}
{"text":"The good: so much original stuff inside, cool old bar stools, etc. In recent years the outside has gotten a lot more curb appeal too. The coffee is great. The waitresses are friendly. The food is better than average. The bad? Just one thing: DIRTY. Dirty as in they need to close the restaurant for two days, get some hot soapy water and bleach and cleaners, start on one end and make their way to the other. Is that so hard? I like this place and it has potential, it's definitely one of the oldest historic places in North Olmsted, but when you sit down for breakfast and have the urge to grab cleaners and towels and wipe down the blinds at your table, that's no good. They really, really need to WIPE IT DOWN and clean the place top to bottom. If they did that I would say it's worthy of five stars. I hope the owners read this and take it to heart but I doubt they will. It's a shame!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just found my new breakfast joint. Nice people, and just really good food.   It's a small family place, and the eggs were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the price. A small, family place that actually makes homemade food. I had pork chops with home fries. My gf had meat loaf with home fries. Both dinners came with bread, soup (homemade navy bean), vegetable, and dessert. Coffee and tea were both fresh. Service was excellent. Highly recommended if dining on a budget or just want a simple, homemade meal."}
{"text":"Went w my buddy on a Monday morning. This place has been here forEVER. Started w a hot chocolate w whipped cream - mmm. Then had some French toast, eggs, bacon, and a side of corned beef hash.  Overall the food was fine, nothing spectacular but well done.  The staff was great, fast, and prices were cheap. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"We like to eat local when we travel, and this place seemed to fit the bill - a lil mom & pop establishment notfar from our hotel. All locals but us (several were \"goin' fishin'\"). The coffee was no-frills good. The pancakes were tasty, fluffy and reasonably sized, unlike some places who seem to think size equals quality. Hash browns: crispy; scrambled eggs: fluffy; over-easy eggs: perfect. No downsides here, unless you are looking for fancy-schmancy."}
{"text":"This is an excellent breakfast spot to avoid going to the numerous chains in the area. Well priced, good service, and good food."}
{"text":"My brother was in town from Tampa, staying with a relative about an hour west of where I live, and suggested that he and I meet for breakfast at Ari's, as it was mid-way between us.  Plain-Jane and naturally retro-cool, Ari's menu offered sufficient choices, and while I was tempted by the pancakes, I ordered a veggie omelette, hashbrowns, and wheat toast.  Our server kept our coffee cups filled, delivered our food shortly after we ordered it, and cleared plates when they were empty.  Decent food and good service will bring me back to Ari's;  if I lived in this neck of the woods, I might stop in once in a while (the other diners there this morning seemed to be a bunch of regulars).  The restaurant could use some elbow grease and a spit-shine (the bases of the stools at the counter would look good if they were scrubbed and polished), and the clutter in the hallway leading to the restrooms should be stored out of sight, but our table top and seats were clean."}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and were looking for something locally owned.  Ari's didn't disappoint.  Great coffee and the food was tasty, plentiful, reasonably priced and served with a huge dose of friendliness. :)"}
{"text":"This is not fancy, but is a classic American diner. Friendly staff, lots of banter between the regulars and staff. As an out of towner, I was made to feel welcome without any craziness. Prompt service, coffee kept full. Good breakfast options. Ordered an egg-meat-home fries combo, which was promptly delivered with eggs cooked perfectly as ordered (I'm picky 'bout that). Only 1 disappointment - the \"home fries\" we're really hash browns.....not the same thing at all! Also I1 area for improvement - coffee was not good...not nasty bad, just watery with no real good coffee flavor.  Plan to return on a future trip (this visit was Sept 2017) to try one of the pancake options. If they're still open, since from the customer-staff banter, it seems the land owner plans to put in a drive in restaurant in the space."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years, but am not too impressed.  I love diners & family restaurants, but this place has not been renovated since the beginning of time!  It looks like something out of an early 1970's time warp, once indoors.  Most of the times, my food was good, but the last time I was there recently, the eggs were way undercooked.  I wasn't too happy!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth eating at when you want a quick easy breakfast. It is right on the corner of Lorain rd in north olmsted across from Starbucks which when I sitting in the booth with my husband and I saw Starbucks I was wishing for their coffee instead. That is the reason I gave four stars to Ari's restaurant. The food was good and quickly prepared and we were happy as the waitress was really nice to us."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever. The corned beef hash is as good as it gets and the coffee good. The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Good basic breakfast staples. Amazing service. Terrible coffee! Yuck! But at least it was fresh!!! Simple and to the point. Not a bad little spot when in the area."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, low prices. Stumbled upon this and knew by the shady exterior that we were in for an adventure... Turned out to be a great one! Pancakes, home fires and more were all tasty."}
{"text":"If I had to describe Ari's in 3 words, it'd be cozy, comfortable, and tasty.  Seriously, that sums it up!  It's rather like eating at a family dinner in your grandma's kitchen.  Everyone was friendly, staff and other customers alike.  Breakfast was like we used to get on the farm.  OK, I've never actually HAD breakfast on a farm, but it's what I imagine it would be.  Everything was cooked perfectly, portions were more than ample, and they were glad to have you linger over coffee and chat after your meal was over.  If you're looking for a gourmet, fancy, dining \"experience\"...you'll likely be disappointed.  But if you want to be treated like an old friend, and get a wonderful, home cooked meal while they're at it...this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We eat here DAILY and every Sunday. This morning we were asked by our waitress PER her boss-to leave. Said we were taking too long. We were there a little longer than usual-a little over an hour. My mom is elderly and she eats a little slower than she used to. Out of courtesy, I repeatedly check the door every time we are here to make sure no one is waiting for a table. There was never anyone waiting today or any other time we have been here. I thought the rude, unwelcoming \"ambiance\" would go away once the old  owner left but I see it is alive and well with the new owners.  I completely understand that they make money the more people that come and go but there was never anyone waiting. Bye bye Ari's. My money spends down the street just as easy."}
