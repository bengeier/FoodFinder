{"text":"Petit resto bar dans le superbe cartier fleurissant d'Ahunstic. 

Je travail dans le cartier, ma première expérience fut très agréable. J'était accompagner de plusieurs collègue et de mes patron. Nous avons eu un bon service et les drinks et plats fut délicieux.

J'y suis retourner trois fois par la suite. Trois fois parce que je voulais vraiment aimer la place... Beau local, belle terasse, beau menu bien travailler, drinks originaux mais service horrible! J'y suis retourner plusieurs fois pour m'assurer ne pas être simplement tomber sur un mauvais serveur. Mais trois serveurs différents plus tard.. Trois déceptions. 

On nous offres pas autre choses quand on a fini notre verre, en nous débarassant on nous ne demande pas si c'était a notre goût, service froid sans sourrires... J'ai attendu 30 minuttes après avoir fini mon verre pour avoir du service. J'en aurais commander un autre mais puisque j'ai du me lever pour me faire servire après tout ce temps, j'ai demander la facture. Une autre fois en soirée il n'y avais que 4 clients, il on décider que la cuisine était fermer.. J'ai du supplier pour me faire cuire une frites!

Bref, cet endroit a beaucoup de potentiel, je lui es laisser plusieurs chances.. C'est fini. Je le conseil a aucun de mes clients et amis.."}
{"text":"Les Incorruptibles est un nouvel arrivé sur la promenade Fleury dans la tendance des nouveaux commerces qui s'installent sur la section ouest de cette rue. En s'installant dans la section est, plus proche de Christophe Colomb, les Incorruptibles amène un vent de fraîcheur (Je parle en connaissance de cause. J'ai habité longtemps proche et je suis allée au secondaire à une rue de Fleury.) sur une artère longtemps négligée de Montréal.

Leurs drinks sont délicieux. J'ai tendance à ne prendre que des gin tonics quand je vais boire avec des amis et très souvent le drink est trop sucré. Les Incorruptibles est un des seuls endroits où le gin tonic est réussi à perfection. Leurs différents drinks sont très bons et le service est au petits soins. Sinon l'ambiance rétro met dans le mood pour une soirée entre amis et la musique est vraiment géniale.

L'espace lounge est parfait pour les gros groupes. Appelez pour réserver si vous y allez la fin de semaine, car c'est bondé et vous trouverez rarement de la place si vous êtes plus de deux..."}
{"text":"The last stop on our restaurant week eating extravaganza and this was by far the favourite of the four restaurants we tried. FYI we booked through opentable but the restaurant did not seem to have the reservation. Although the server and staff were extremely accommodating given this fact, I recommend reserving through their website rather than a third party like opentable just in case. 

The ambiance is perfect for a group setting or a romantic evening. Out of the four restaurants we tried this week, this was the first one where 2.5 hours relatively flew by and we didn't feel like we were waiting for service or the next course. I think it's because our amazing server \"checked in\" on us often and refilled our waters without us noticing we needed anything. 

The short rib and salmon tartare were amazing. I believe they're both on the regular menu so we will definitely be back to order these items again."}
{"text":"This local bar started out as just a place to hang out and have a drink with great friends and great staff....now that they have a kitchen and an amazing chef, it is becoming a hot spot and is the best kept secret in Montreal.  Great food, great wine list, their signature cocktails are quite special....everything at Les Incorruptibles is special and deserves to be discovered."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this much praised restaurant & bar after being referred to it by the whisky ambassador for Jim Beam. Upon entering we were pleased to see that they were well stocked with a vast quantity of spirits, a great collection of bitters and a good many house-made cordials and flavouring syrups. 

We were greeted by a male bartender. We immediately hit it off with a friendly conversation about the great layout the establishment had and his response made us believe that he was a long-time employee.

He offered to \"craft\" me a cocktail based on my taste preference that we had just discussed and I eagerly agreed. He went on and on about how amazing of a \"mixologist\" he was. 

When I received my cocktail, I was surprised to find it undrinkable. He tasted it from the left-over in the shaker and quickly responded that the proportions were wrong and that he'd make me another one right away. When the corrected cocktail was served to me, I found it once again sub-par. But I was polite and told him that it alright, offering him some suggestions on different bitters and whisky brand that I would recommend making it with. His facial expression to my own knowledge of the spirits and industry was obviously an insult to him because he abruptly cut our conversation short and spent the next half hour flirting with a group of girl customers at the other end of the bar, not once looking over to see if we needed anything. 

When we finally managed to catch his attention (after walking over to the other end of the bar to ask him for our bill) I was shocked to see that he had charged us for three drinks: my girlfriend's' and both of mine, that is, the one I drank and the one that he messed up and threw away. I had to remind him that he voluntarily remade my drink and argued for a few minutes before he finally fixed our bill. 

I see from other reviews on this website that other people have had terrible service from this bar and the bartender's attitude seem an obvious problem. This place could be great if their attitude was as amazing as the selection of spirits they have in stock. I certainly will not be going back."}
{"text":"Cet endroit est rapidement devenu un classique, comblant un vide sur la Promenade Fleury. En plus d'être un bar à cocktail avec des mixologue de talent, le menu offre une sélection parfaite pour partager. Enfin le staff est presque le même depuis l'ouverture, un bon signe de constance et de qualité. Astuce : pour maximiser votre expérience, je recommande de prendre des places au bar."}
{"text":"Rolling up twenty minutes before they were due to open and mildly famished, the Incorruptible made a good impression on my heart right away by urging us to have a seat, have a beer, not sweat foolish things like \"opening hours.\" And then I loved them again for improvising a platter for us of anything they could pull together from an as-yet-unopened kitchen, which ended up being a bunch of my favorite things, oysters, charcuterie, house roasted nuts, pickled things. They have a pretty patio but the real sweet spot for me is the square vintage lovely couch in the back, perfect for late night libations with incorrigible but probably a little bit corruptible friends."}
{"text":"I'm writing this on behalf of a friend who had planned an evening there for 20 people which I was a part of. Let me start by saying that when a party is expecting 5 course and only 4 show up and the reason behind it is that the owner/chef felt he was losing out financially because 4 people from the party didn't show, is really pathetic and really bad business sense. I guess he didn't take into consideration that almost everyone ordered bottles of wine and one couple ordered bottles that were over $500. 
Also nothing was said about the missing course until the waiter was asked about it. Ok so they comped the drinks the host had offered the guests (around 12 or so mojitos) but the point is everyone ended up leaving hungry.

Besides that the food was decent and the service was ok but I or the party planner will not be going back."}
