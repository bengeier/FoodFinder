{"text":"When Joanne Kates, Canada's top food critic named Pastis as the best restaurant in Toronto, I thought hmmmm...I'll give it a shot. Just across the street from the LCBO at Summerhill, it's reasonably inviting from the outside. I would totally agree with the \"first to review\" (Erin) writeup, the decor needs some updating and it would be nice to have them open up the space a bit --- I was jammed into the traffic lane with servers and other patrons bumping into my back all night (brutal). 

As for the food, it was quite good. I liked the fact that the flavours were subtle but not bland (that's generally a very tough balance to get). The tomato salad sure felt like a taste of summer (not the one in 500 Days). As for the main, I had the calf liver which was overdone but satisfying nonetheless. Given it's a bistro, dessert could have been nothing less than creme brulee which is arguably hard to screw up in my view (don't think I've ever had a bad one). Bottom line, solid dining spot but bring the body armour. 

+ives: fresh, subtle but balanced flavours -ives: SEATING, get some cushions and open it up (felt like a mosh pit in the back)"}
{"text":"Dessert yes! Service yes!!! A very unassuming place; the food and service outdid the vibe. I agree with the other posters that it is dated, but so what when you are so relaxed and sated. 
Worth dropping in. You'll feel happy when you leave."}
{"text":"I think this French Bistro hit its peak in the nineties when moules et Frites were words understood only by those lucky enough to have gone through French immersion.  But nowadays moules et Frites is about as foreign a dish as lasagna and no one is surprised to face it on a menu.

So, Pastis is good, but the decor is tired -- circa 95 -- and the staff are even more so.  They have maintained the snobby French attitude they have had since the day the restaurant opened but no longer deserve it, so they are even slightly bitter.  The clientele is mostly middle-aged Rosedalers who take pleasure in pronouncing the restaurant's name correctly -- \"I'm going to Pasteeeece for Dinner tonight\".

Whatever.  I can have mussels and Fries anywhere without the attitude or the price."}
