{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place and left extremely disappointed. After seeing a post on BlogTO and the amazing reviews I thought tonight would be the best day to check it out. We ordered 2 appetizers, a soup, and 3 main dishes and everything was just OK, bland, and nothing special. It was just not a memorable meal but if I had to point out a positive, I will say the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"sad the Persian spot is gone, but happy with Chop Chop great friendly attentive service (felt like a family-run affair) fair pricing delicious  I plan on returning"}
{"text":"I love the decor so much, the lighting and colours are so nice. We ordered the pan fried dumplings and the spicy and sour soup - both were very good! Also inexpensive so that's always a plus."}
{"text":"What a gem! Stopped in for a quick bite on a whim and couldn't be more satisfied! We had the boiled pork and veggie dumplings (perfectly chewy and flavourful) the ginger beef (light and delicious, not the typical dish that comes heavy and makes your stomach hurt afterwards) and the green papaya salad with peanuts (fresh, crunchy and so tasty!) Prices were all on point and the service was amazing! I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best late night eat decision we could have made. Got veggie dumplings, Pork dumplings, green beans, and scallion pancake. All were incredible and hit the spot. The owners were also so kind and recommended dishes to us."}
{"text":"I worry about Chop Chop's future: that as they gain popularity, they will decrease portion sizes and increase prices. For now, id say this place is a solid destination because the prices are excellent and the portions are huge . If these two things were to change, not sure my rating would hold up.  Because of the low prices, I was deceived into thinking I should order a lot. I ordered so much at one point we had to tap out and cancel a dish. We had leftovers from 5 dishes shared between 2 of us.  Service was friendly, apologetic when it needed to me, but strangely inconsistent . Not bad service for us - we got all our dishes at a good pace - but strangely the couple next to us had a lot of issues I observed. Told right away what was sold out, which I appreciate it. loved the boiled dumplings, but wish the red vinegar was more vinegar-y -- tasted like nothing.  Green beans were a star and should be ordered. Sauce w the spring rolls was like a sweet honey plum sauce. Sadly we didn't really like their version of green onion pancake, found it too dry (me-should be greasy or flaky) and too salty (him). Bathroom clean.   Room was almost insufferably hot, so dress light"}
{"text":"First off, the food is fantastic and I'll eventually return to eat my way through the rest of the menu. We ordered the Pan-fried Pork & Chive Dumplings, Hot & Sour Soup, Spicy Cucumber Salad and Char Siu BBQ Pork. And we ordered beer that never came.   There seemed to be more than adequate staff for the amount of people dining - two servers and four or five people in the kitchen. There were fewer than 30 seats and I'd estimate about 20 people dining at the time we were there. Despite this, the kitchen seemed chaotic, and the servers were flying around the room frantically.   We received saucers for the sauce, but not the actual caddy of sauces. Also, our chopsticks and napkins arrived after our first plate was placed on the table. Only when one of our dishes arrived did he ask if we wanted rice with it, so we had to wait longer for that to arrive as well. Hopefully with some fine-tuning, this place will become a neighbourhood staple."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and grabbed lunch at this fun spot! Seating is limited but the food is fantastic with generous portions. We split the vermicelli noodles, scallion pancake, ginger beef, and boiled pork and chive dumplings. The restaurant was a little hectic when we popped in with only one server running around, still everything was well seasoned and the food came quickly. Authentic flavors with a fun aesthetic, loved the contrasts between blue and red  decor. The dumplings were the highlight, plump and juicy with the perfect blend of chives. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cozy and clean restaurant. Tasty food and good price. Not good for a big group but good for group under 4 ppl. Patio area is big."}
{"text":"Best Shanghainese food I've had in ages! So tasty that we couldn't for take a proper pic before digging in! Onion pancake and potstickers (pork/veg) are amazing! Nom mom nom!"}
{"text":"Well dropped in twice to have the best HOT and SOUR soup in Toronto.  This soup was so thick with mushrooms and vegetables, what an achievement. Love the freshness of this place with an eye for detail and the price point is bang on!!!"}
{"text":"As a Taiwanese person, I have to say, this place is by no means authentic. However, there's nothing wrong with that.   I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodles. The soup base and the noodles were a lot lighter than the traditional Taiwanese noodles. I was unsure how to feel about that at first, but I realize that this could be an introduction to Taiwanese food for people who aren't use to the strong flavors that Asian foods sometimes have. This, in combination with the decor and presentation of the place, is a good way of promoting Taiwanese dishes and introduce non-Taiwanese people to Taiwanese dishes. Despite it not being so authentic."}
{"text":"Last night, we were seated outside! It was a lovely experience, as it was a beautiful night, and we weren't forgotten by staff.   As always, we loved the boiled and the pan fried dumplings.  We also got the Shanghai noodles, Chinese broccoli with beef, fried squid and general Tao chicken.   The Shanghai noodles lacked a bit of flavour, so we mixed in the general tao sauce - as it had a lot of flavour.   The general Tao chicken was really well done. The chicken was the perfect chewy-ness.   The Chinese broccoli was a large dish - as it was piled up! The beef that was added was chewy and not dry.   Fried squid was a surprising delight. It was fried perfectly. Not too over battered and not over-fried. I actually like this dish here more than traditional Chinese places.   It was a lot of food for three people, and we ended up clearing all the dishes but the Chinese broccoli. Safe to say that Chop Chop is a top choice for me."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat Chinese food in the city. What's great is they have a small menu and focus on making those dishes awesome. Most Chinese places I find have too much on their menu and never know what to pick. General Tao and fried Shanghai noodles are my favorite dishes. I'll try some more new stuff next time."}
{"text":"Went today for a quick bowl of hot and sour soup. (which is vegetarian by the way). You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and it was made in house. It had just the right balance. Loved the space too and will definitely return to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Service was fine, the server made a few suggestions and was friendly. Went on a Sunday evening and was seated within 20 minutes for a group of 4.  FOOD: The food was OK, the portions were a generous amount but I felt some dishes lacked flavour. The Hot and Sour soup had no taste,  neither hot or sour. The dumplings were good and the spring rolls were crunchy. The beef noodle soup was good. The crispy chicken was slightly too salty.   AMBIENCE: Chop chop has a very clean and modern looking space."}
{"text":"Their green onion pancake is excellent, as is their beef and eggplant. Less good the basil chicken (too much breading) and squid. The fried pork and chive dumplings are the best I have had."}
{"text":"Chop chop is a little gem in the city in my opinion. Small family run business serving delicious Chinese food! I first came here after going to the boardgame café just down the street and ordered a few dishes to try. The restaurant is quite small, probably about 20 seats on the inside, but they have a little terrasse area in the summer time to have a few more seating spaces. After the first visit I just couldn't stop thinking about chop chop and the next time I'll be going! I had to go back and try every dish!  The general tao chicken, the sweet and sour pork, the dumplings, the ma po tofu, the pork and eggplant, the Chinese pancake, the salt and pepper squid, all are incredibly delicious! It taste so much like home cooked food, just like dishes my mom would make at home. And now that I've moved to a different city from my family, finding a place that taste like home is the best thing in the world. Even the atmosphere was very homely and the owners are super nice.  The prices can be a bit higher than expected, each dish is about $12-14 depending on what you order, but the dumplings are around $8-10 a dish which is pretty good pricing. But honestly, I would pay the price for a little piece of home :)"}
{"text":"There is a menu available online and a special menu available in store, which I suppose must change from time to time! The additional menu in store offered vegetarian pan fried dumplings on the day that we dropped by, and it was absolutely delicious!   The decor is very nice because it's glass all over! We sat right beside where the heater is, so it worked out in the super cold freezing rain day.  Our waiter said food is made from scratch so it's possible for my vegetarian friend to ask for dishes that is suppose to contain meat to be cooked without meat!"}
{"text":"Alot of hype around this Dundas west spot so expectations were high. Unfortunately it failed to live up to it. Had the beef noodle, spicy cucumber salad and honey chicken wing. The beef noodle was the biggest disappointment seeing that had plenty better at other random places. The pan fried  dumplings looked good at the other table, but unfortunately this visit didn't inspire me to want to come back to give it a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I used to live in Taiwan, so Chop Chop is an authentic flashback to that hole-in-the-wall type shops that are common there.   We ordered the basil chicken, Shanghai noodles, dumplings, green beans and mapo tofu. Everything was great, the particular highlight was the chicken - crispy and fabulously tasty - if a little slightly high in salt. My partner liked the mapo tofu the best, stating it retained the heat of the wok nicely.  My grandma gave her stamp of approval, and that's more than good enough for me. I'll be back :)!"}
{"text":"This is everything I want in a restaurant serving Taiwanese/ Chinese cuisine! Chop Chop is family-run, modern with well-thought out and minimal decor, and serving the classics. The location lets a lot of natural light in and the space is lofty, which allows for a comfortable location to have a long lunch or dinner.   We ordered:  Smashed cucumber salad - Cucumber salad is a classic accompaniment to many Chinese dinners and Chop Chop's version had a spin on it but still really reminded me of the salads my mother and grandmother would make. My friend worked in Beijing for a year and was looking forward to trying this dish again. It was crunchy, savoury and did not disappoint.   Mapo tofu - Another dish I grew up eating and a favourite of my friend. The tofu was delicious and not extremely spicy to suit a more Western palate.   Taiwanese basil fried chicken - It came with fried basil leaves and was my favourite dish of the meal. The chicken was super crunchy and seasoned well with 5-spice flavour.   Taiwanese beef noodle soup - This is a favourite of mine but I've definitely had better versions elsewhere. Even though the soup and udon noodles were perfect, the beef wasn't braised enough and the colour of the meat was very light.   Besides the food, service was extremely attentive (but not overbearing) even though the restaurant was somewhat busy. I really appreciated the open kitchen and would definitely forgo Chinatown to come here again."}
{"text":"Really good! Cute decor, delicious food, reasonably priced. We had boiled pork and chive dumplings, hot and sour soup, cucumber salad and a chive and pork pocket. Everything was good, the dumplings fat and juicy and the cucumber salad crunchy and favourful. The only minor complaint was that it was a bit hot inside - either they don't have AC or it isn't very strong. It wasn't a very hot day so I could see this being a problem in warmer weather. (There is a cute patio space, but it isn't open yet as their licence hasn't come through.) Service was a bit frazzled, but the food was so good that I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were there for lunch on a weekday and it was a great experience - service was friendly, food came out at a good speed and temperature, and loved the bright space and clean decor. The flavours were great, really homey food with a Taiwanese edge. The hot and sour soup was so flavourful, and the boiled dumplings were big and juicy. Will definitely return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The basil chicken was nuts. Everyone needs to try it. Meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. These guys pay attention to detail and don't take shortcuts. Everything is fresh and made to order. The host was great too. Very knowledgeable and more than willing to share his knowledge of Taiwanese food. Come out and support these guys. They make food the right way."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!  Order a few items for take out, including their famous hot and sour soup. That soup will clear up any sinuses/sniffles you have, guaranteed. Good spice level and texture. I found that they did not skimp out on the goodness added to the soup, it was filled with mushrooms and other things that made the soup very hearty. Also tried their veggie spring rolls and fried vermicelli. Portion size for the vermicelli was huge and can easily be split between two people. It tasted spectacular! My friend is a vegetarian and I did not miss out on the shredded pork at all, she thoroughly enjoyed her meal also. What also adds to the 5 star rating was their service. They were able to communicate and give updates on wait times. Also, cant forget to mention the Chinese white bunny candies they leave out at the front, what a cute treat! I'll def be back :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious food and cute atmosphere. My friend got the general tao chicken and she said it was very good. I got the beef noodle soup and the dish included thick noodles with rich braised beef pieces and sliced bok choi in a spicy broth. Both portion sizes were pretty generous (especially the noodle soup). We also split a large creme brûlée, which was delicious as well."}
{"text":"as a Chinese person, eating Chinese food for a long time. This is really expensive and bad.  It may suit your taste bud, but for me, really underwhelmed."}
{"text":"A surprisingly Taiwanese restaurant located at an unexpected location. The name I love and use; the food is a different thing. Hardly any decor and basically you eat and run. Not a place to hang out. The small open kitchen can be seen and it reminds you of your parents' kitchen. Some seats can be uncomfortable. The washroom is small too.   Food: the beef noodle soup was hot in temperature and in spice which I love. The beef looked more like pork to me. They didn't have the sour pickled veggies that go with it. The noodle wasn't chewy enough. Good thing it was a good portion.  The \"ma pao tofu\" was alright. Nothing special about it. We did ask to delete some spice to it. The sad part is that the steam rice came like 2 minutes later and it was an additional cost.  The pan fried green onion pancake wasn't what I expected. It was hard instead of chewy. Dry too!!   It's not the best Taiwanese restaurant, but I'm glad that they are trying and giving that community a little taste of Taiwan.   Verdict: I would go back to try their other dish. Not a lot on the menu which then they can focus more on their specialities. Perhaps only if I'm in that area again.   Improvement - perhaps play Taiwanese music instead of loud English songs. For a small place, the music was quite loud for lunch time."}
{"text":"Great little spot on Dundas. Huge portions at a great price. Spicy cucumber salad is delicious and the staff is quite nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Update: I came back to try the General Tsao chicken and the vermicelli noodles as promised.   The chicken was AMAZING - it was crispy but not over fried, and there was just the right amount of sauce. I would definitely reorder this!  The vermicelli portion size was huge, we ended up taking most of it home. It was also pretty good! The shrimp wontons were crispy and great as well.   I love the atmosphere of this place, the high ceilings and ceiling windows make this place look bright and modern. They also have a patio! I will keep coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for somewhere near by her place to have dinner and we're so glad we found it. The prices are very good, 12 boiled dumplings for $8. We also got 8 pan fried dumplings for $9 and their deep fried 5 pieces of shrimp wontons for $6. The shrimp wontons were very tasty with the garlic spicy mayo it was served with. I'll definitely be coming back here if I'm in the area again."}
