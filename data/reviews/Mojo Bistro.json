{"text":"For a little loungy place tucked away in Bellvue, mojo bistro is everything you could hope for walking in, and more.  Pleasant and accommodating staff welcome you in and are more than willing to share thoughts on the offerings of the day.  Between the three of we enjoying a meal at mojo bistro we had three different styles, all created and prepared with a love for the food involved.   Starting the meal with a cup -this was the perfect size- of jalapeno soup was the way to go for two diners, we thoroughly enjoyed this cream based soup served with a small scoop of sour cream on the side.  Not too spicy at all, but with wonderful jalapeno flavor, a little chicken and cheese and it came together nicely on the palate.  Our third decided on the polenta, fried into tiny little rectangles and proffered with a tomato dip -an almost marinara (much better than a traditional marinara, much more fresh and less seasoned)  as well as balsamic reduction drizzled on the plate - a perfect warm up to the meal.  The plating was also quite pretty for the dishes, additional proof of the chef's pride in the food created for the diners (not that the wonderful flavors weren't enough.)   Served with the appetizers were warm croissanrolls, with a honey-butter.  Enough said, le sigh. Meal #1 was shrimp skewered and placed on top of cheesy grits sprinkled with bacon.  A smoky flavor permeated the dish, a taste this reviewer isn't always fond of, but with the combination of the ingredients, it made sense and was enjoyed by all. Meal #2 was a Fusilli dish (my apologies on not remembering the full name) -- rich and hearty.  Chicken and andouille sausage among other ingredients and spices in a marinara sauce that was almost creamy.  The clean plate club visited here. Meal #3 were mojo bistro's crab cakes.  We diners do believe it was fresh crab flaking from the cakes with such a sweet taste on our buds.  Served on top of a piece of cooked spinach leaf, placed on a crispy risotto patty (potato pancake style), with a creamy horseradish teaser on the side to dip, and topped with sliced cooked carrots, dear reviewer believes this to be the favorite of the evening. We ended the evening with a decent cup of coffee and an absolutely delicious Creme Brulee.  Decadently creamy and perfectly carmelized, this custard was a perfect way to end an otherwise fantastic meal.  The atmosphere was cozy, despite our group being one of the only sets of diners; although from the look of the dinner menu, which changes daily, they must have had a busier night prior to our arrival.  mojo bistro has been open since March 2007, is in Bellvue, a small dry town (yes, byob) on the outskirts of Pittsburgh (about 16-20minutes away from the Southside).  they have a lunch menu which consists of apps, salads and sandwiches, all priced for more than your average cold-cut and lettuce on white, but also much more worthy of the extra few dollars for a hearty and tasty sandwich, take-out is available.   Go and Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny little neighborhood place.  We went on a Friday night and were very surprised to find the place half empty.  I had the Surf and Turf, it was a petite filet mignon with Cajun creole seasoned shrimp.  The entree was served with garlic mashed potatoes (so yummy) and green beans.  My date was not so lucky, he selected the catfish with sweet potato souffle, only to find out they were out of catfish.  He opted for the tilapia, and requested it to be served with the catfish side dishes, but wouldn't you know, they came back to our table again to say they were out of the sweet potato souffle.  All in all, a nice dinner, but a quirky odd little place.  Oh and BYOB."}
{"text":"While I applaud the Mojo Bistro for their late hours, allowing me to get an ice coffee late at night, I really go there for the food.  The coffee comes out rather standard, and almost rushed.  The staff are nice, but much more reserved.  This is a place I \"run in and out of\" if I am dressed in jeans or out for a walk - as it tends to cater to a slighter more \"upscale\" clientele.    On the other hand, the food is excellent. The atmosphere is great for taking future in-laws, parents, relatives, and bosses you may want to impress for a little \"local flavor.\"  The lunch and dinner menus are varied enough to give just about anyone something they would like. The deserts, while expensive, are so light and rich, they are worth the extra dollars.    Definitely try the sweet potato fries. . .and bring your own wine."}
