{"text":"Have been to Cantina Mexicana once. Enjoyed the food, very tasty. For the Kids meals, tacos were on the menu, Beef was chosen, but it was just ground beef, and runny at that. Chicken Mole was terriffic.  On our second visit, the rest was a little busier, although not full. We are a family of 5 (3 kids) and although there was enough room to seat us, and tables near each other the hsotess would not allow us to sit, and said we would have to wait 1/2 hour untill another table of 5 were done. i offered to move and configure the tables myself, but was told \"NO\", there would be no room for me (hostess) to serve. Well, if they dont want my money, I'm sure someone else does!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years. Have been going here on and off for years as well (from 10 years back with my girlfriend, and now my wife). Food has always been good, feels authentic from the experience to the food (although I'm not Mexican so I can't REALLY comment on that front). Highly recommended since there are so few quality Mexican restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"A nice location in the village of streetsville , a family owned restaurant, exorbitant prices on the menu, my wife and I were hoping the food to be good.  My wife proposed to order small portions (and lucky we were).  Best part was the service, the food was tasteless and bad and over priced.   I seriously wanted to call 911 for they murdered the Mexican food. Never ever, stepping back to this restaurant, unless things change for better.  I have to post a star to post the review, else I would love to get away with 0 stars"}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem in the quaint section of Mississauga called Streetsville.  Every year I go to Long Beach/Los Angeles area and satisfy my craving for quality  Mexican fare. This is the closest I have gotten to the LA experience in the GTA.  My companion ordered the 3 taco plate (2 chicken, 1 chorizo) and a lime margarita. I ordered the beef fajitas. We shared the guacamole dip for an appetizer.  Not enough can be said about the guacamole dip with accompanying salsa. Unbelievable fresh and authentic. Chips obviously made in-house.    I'm not a drinker, but had a sip of my companions margarita and it was delicious.  I can't say whether it was a good one as margaritas go, since I have very little experience in the field.  Dr. Cyndi, however, said she enjoyed it.  Entrees arrive and several surprises emerge.  First off, all shells and tortillas are homemade.  No regular sour cream for this place....it is true crema Mexicana. Portions are of a large size and delicious.  You will immediately be struck by how fresh everything tastes.  The reason I am taking off a star (I really wanted to take off 1/2 star, but it seems Yelp won't let you do that) is the quantity and quality of the beef in my fajitas.  Although delicious, they could have done a little better in that area.  No matter, next time I'll have the chicken.  The service is a little slower than you may expect, but just remember they are doing this in a homemade, traditional way.  Waited 10 mins for drinks, 30 mins for entree....this with a full house.  Not bad at all.  I love discovering these small, family owned places when cooking obviously is a passion.  I'm still going to L.A. in January, but now I know where to go for the other 11 months.  Bill for 2 was $55 including tax."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The owner was so rude from the moment we walked in .. Until we left. We sat outside as it was stifling hot inside. Ordered chips and salsa.. Received the smallest amount of salsa... About 2 teaspoons. Ordered the taco salad, which the owner said she would have to check to see if she had shells.. If there were none, li had to order something else. My friend ordered a burrito. Order came, the salad was flavourless and had a couple small pieces of chicken.. Almost all of it was lettuce. Burrito was bland with a small amount of cheese on top and rice that smelled and resembled Uncle Ben's. Our waitress was extremely hot .. Temperature wise.. And was sweating. She then told us she keeps a cloth in the kitchen to wipe her face with. At that point we finished our drinks and off we went. Waste of money and time. Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a shame the service was so terrible because there are very few authentic Mexican restaurants in the GTA.  The server, who also happened to be the owner, was so rude and made for a vet uncomfortable experience. She was very short with us and was trying to rush us out, even though it took her at least a half hour to get a drink order and didn't offer refills once.  There were two other staff members there, clearing tables and bringing food (which took a while to come also, but the menu warns to \"be patient\"), but only the owner was taking orders and making drinks, so it's no wonder she is utterly miserable.  The food is alright, but expensive. I am not exactly sure what you're paying for, because it's certainly not the service.  All in all, this place could be great if they brought on at least one extra server and treated customers like, well, customers, and not like a nuisance. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Considering the price, the portion is really small. More importantly, it tastes way too bland. Have been to too many Mex restaurant in the States, I don't think it's authentic at all."}
{"text":"AWESOME food, GREAT service, don't believe me? give it a try and taste the difference."}
{"text":"I was excited to discover a Mexican restaurant, but ended up being a Mexican Hole in the ground, instead. After waiting only 30 minutes for water; another 15 to have our order taken, the lack of consideration, lack of service and lack of satisfaction after eating our food, that took 75 minutes to arrive, we decided to get up, ask for the bill and leave without paying any tip.  Never going back, even though the salsa and guacamole was great!   In final, extremely disappointed they provided premium plus packaged crackers, to go along with the $11 Ceviche.. #BigLetDown"}
{"text":"We almost skipped this restaurant because of the negative reviews on Yelp.   However, we did not. My wife insisted that we try it.   I must say I was very happy with our decision.   The hostess was very nice to our family.   The ambiance was spot on.   The food was great. We left stuffed.   It was no more expensive than the chain full service restaurants.   With so many Mexican fast food joints, I believe people do not appreciate a full service Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"ok im spill the beans about this place i dont care anymore when i used to work there there was floods there every week the plumber was there every week and the worst thing about it she was still serving food to people think u wanna eat there think again i hope this place close down soon"}
{"text":"This review is based on 2 experiences.  Stopped in for lunch, started with the chips and guac, which was excellent and fresh, with nice presentation in the mortar/pestle.  The wife and both had the chorizo chimmichanga, and loved it.  Definitely a siesta inspiring lunch.   We also had them cater our 2yr old birthday party this last weekend.  Great reviews all around from guests on the empanada appetizer, burritos, quesadillas and enchilladas.   Mama Maria, the owner/operator is very helpful and accomodating."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years now . I suggest you have have the tacos because the food is allways fresh and authentic tasting. It is a very small place but I like it better than burrito boys"}
{"text":"Thank goodness I take reviews with a grain of salt or I would have missed out.  Went here today with hubby. We ordered the tamale, nopales de norte, tacos al pastor and mole. Also ordered beef empanada and chorizo perogie to go which we have not tried yet.  Keep in mind we have not had authentic Mexican before when reading this review, except for tamale and empanada. The tamale was so flavourful and tasty. The nopales de Norte (cactus) was also very yummy and well spiced. Our mains, the mole and tacos al pastor were rich and the meat in both were well flavoured. Refried beans were a highlight with a slight smokey flavour. We would definitely eat it all again and can't wait to go again and try new dishes. The service was very friendly. A nice older lady (owner) who was patient and kind. I'm so confused by other reviews that mention her rudeness........this cannot be true as she was so kind, talkative and appreciative of our excitement with the food.  Only negatives were atmosphere......tv was on playing a movie and it was really cold. If heat was on, no tv and Mexican music playing, I'd have given 5 stars. The restaurant itself is a little dated, however don't let that deter you from great food."}
{"text":"Cantina Mexicana is a cute little, family owned Mexican restaurant. The owner is a tender elderly woman, originally from Mexico, so the dishes and the atmosphere are seemingly authentic.   When I say the atmosphere is authentic, I mean, it's beaten up and run down. It truly could be in the heart of Mexico (minus the heat) and you wouldn't know the difference. Although, this would probably be a 5 star place in Mexican standards.  The food was good. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu... I was hungry and having a working lunch, so I didn't have enough time for that, but I did notice that there were some fairly \"high-end\" pricey items on the menu. I opted for a $12 chorizo burrito which was pretty yummy. I was warned that I was spicy, it wasn't. I asked for hot sauce, and they lady brought it to me with a warning \"this one is hot!\" It wasn't. So basically if the older woman tells you something is spicy, take it with a grain of salt. I think she has a very low tolerance for spice.  The chorizo perogies have an interesting story. So apparently the Mexican lady married a Polish man. When they opened the restaurant, he insisted that they have something Polish on the menu. Not wanting to stray too far from the Mexican theme, they experimented with numerous perogie fillings. This is what they came up with, and they're pretty darn good. Unique, definitely worth trying.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"5 of us went to this restaurant for our Christmas lunch . We were excited when we entered the restaurant as it had the great Mexican-décor feeling as when you are on holidays, including the nice , thick glasses with the blue rim . Unfortunately our excitement was soon over -as we got our appetizer- nachos - cant say that the nachos felt \"homemade \"at all ...... there was barely any toppings on it , and cheese i would have to look for with a magnifying glass . It was dry , totally without taste and again with hardly any toppings on it  all this for 11.00, not sure what they mean on their menu when they say salsa and fresh veggie goodies as we had none of that - iceberg pieces barely visible , salsa ? i don't remember any salsa maybe some small tomatoes pieces  .... the next was our main meal - well that was another disappointment - 1 of us had the enchiladas - it was OK, 2 of us had  the Fajitas - well let me tell you - chicken super dry , beef chewy , the onions and peppers were fine.... the toppings - well first of all they gave us 1 dish with toppings for the 2 of us -each topping was maybe handful if that for the 2 of us to share- it was served in a nice basket -but the inside had this horrible -old plastic container that was curled from the hot rice used before- divided in 4 -each had 1 topping -we shortly run out from most -specially rice -went to ask for more - they said okay 1 time we can give you but for extra cheese, lettuce we charge extra .  It was such small topping portions that it would barely be enough for 1 -very disappointing with our fajitas! The older lady came to see how everything was and we told her ...she said that the enchiladas were made from scratch - it maybe so but probably days prior as it was not very tasting or very authentic - and she said about our fajitas that well everyone can make fajitas-  and she is right- I am not Mexican but i can definitely make much tasty fajitas -but we were looking for more authentic Mexican taste fajitas that is why we went to their restaurant - I had much better fajitas in Jack Astors then in this \"authentic Mexican restaurant\", our desert was probably the tastiest - it was a cheesecake ( clearly bought and frozen before) and ice cream ....  we also pointed out the outdated , old , disgusting plastic containers (not healthy to eat hot stuff in reused cheap plastic containers that's for sure) and she said she will pass on our concern to the person looking after such complaints ...... I will never know if they did anything about it as neither 1 out of 5 that were there are planning to go ever back to this restaurant and will  and could not recommend  ...."}
{"text":"I went to cantina mexicana with a friend who was craving mexican food.  We parked in the parking lot and as I was walking to the front door of the restaurant, I started to smell really rotten garbage. like sewage smell. I told my friend, that this is reminding of that scene in bridesmaids where they all go to an iffy brazillian restaurant and get really sick. Whatever, we stuck with the plan and walked in. The inside of the restaurant was dark and busy with the lady prepping food right out in the middle of the serving hall. So we chose the patio.  We got some pina coladas (really good) and fajitas for two.  Being a mexican restaurant I was excited to try some chips and guac or salsa that I expected with my meal. They never gave us any. When we asked for some chips and salsa, the lady said 4.50 and brought us a really small portion of some chips (flavourless and didnt look or taste house made) and really terrible salsa. it was crushed tomatoes with lots of black pepper on it. We HATED it after one bite each and asked to see if she would change it to pico de gallo. She complained about the price of tomatoes- she said tomatoes were expensive and bla bla bla- and said she'll see what she can do. She came back with a half tablespoon worth of pico de gallo (and THAT was also a fail.. not enough cilantro and no detection of lime juice or salt to the taste).   Fajitas were pretty bland and bad too. We got fajitas for two and the toppings were REALLY skimpy. They gave 8 tortilla shells and literally ONE TABLESPOON FULL OF each - wilted and brown shredded lettuce, bland rice, and cheese. When we asked for extra cheese (because we used them all after making 3 fajitas) they said, extra charge!   Honestly, the food was bland and not very good but I'd give the food a 2 because the margaritas were delicious. But the service is a ZERO. the old lady who seemed to run the place was pretty much annoyed with all her patrons. She didn't make any eye contact while taking orders or requests for the bill etc...   Will never go back.   ps. while sitting at the patio, the whiff of rotting garbage sewage stench bothered me alot.   pps. the next morning I wasn't epic sick but I was in the bathroom quite a few times with unpleasant tummy rumblings."}
{"text":"The portions are small for what you pay for I was really excited to come but I don't think cost wise it was worth it, I am not asking for mega size stuff but the sizes of mains reminded me of apps not worth it"}
{"text":"Cute little Mexican joint, in Streetsville. Great Service, Good food and so much potential.  The food: the food is okay, I'm surprised there's not much spices or heat in our dishes and the flavour was missing. They seasoned the dishes well but it wasn't enough to bring the dishes alive.  My hot pan dish was more like a stir fry with cheese, understandably for me to wrap them with a corn tortilla however the beef came out  very tough.   The rice, refried beans, bean-soup and corn tortillas were very nice. The veggies were fresh.   The best has to go to the churros, amazing fresh fried churros in cinnamon sugar and caramel sauce. Nice crunch with a soft inside.  The portion sizes do lack a bit however.  SERVICE: Service was very nice, the server was patient and good enough to explain the menu.  The menu is a little hard to understand, the font sizing is a bit off to read. Hoped there would be more pictures.   OVERALL: I'm happy to find this place and would gladly come back to enjoy more churros with drinks."}
{"text":"Only the beers are really Mexican. Food is not worth the price and without any hint of Mexican food seasoning. Service was good but the kitchen is very, very, slow. I will not be back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here before and it wasn't bad, pretty poor experience tonight though. Unhappy waitress, 15 min wait for a bottle of beer and food that was just ok."}
{"text":"I'm not Mexican, but am a Mexican food lover.  This place is a mom and pop place with friendly service, but the food preparation, quality, and taste is not up to par. I would not go back. Had the enchiladas for lunch. Terrible. The best item on the plate was the rice. If you're a fan of Mexican food, try to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Don't come here...Taco Bell is better. We had to wait 2 hours and still didn't get all of our meals."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Peel region ( never happened to me before ) and you are starving for food, and everything else is closed, this is a great place to eat. If your body can survive an extra half an hour to drive somewhere else, do it."}
{"text":"The Chili Relleno! That and black bean soup - alone are worth the trip to Streetsville."}
{"text":"Before my most recent visit; the last time I visited this place was then I was in high school (and I can see why). This place is overpriced for the quality of food and the portion sizes. To add to the madness the service is absolutely garbage. It still boggles my mind to this day as to how they're still in business.   I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and no I wouldn't recommend this place to even my worst enemy."}
{"text":"You might probably heard this little but cozy restaurant is as authentic as mexican food can get around here. The rumours are true! And if you heard its pricey, you bet it is! Oh but it is so worth it.   Wanting authentic hispanic food is not so common to find nowadays around mississauga, this ain't no taco bell. They have tacos, burritos, fajitas, chimichangas, nachos with authentic guacamole and so much more. Heck even the dishes, cups, and jugs are from Mexico. Real recognize real!    To start we got the nachos with guacamole. We got the sampler plate with burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tacos and it also came with rice, refried pinto beans and salad.  which was about $37. Pricey but yummy and everything is filling anyways. If its something that i would get when i come again are the fajitas, the tortillas are hand made & delicious.   Coming here would be once in while sort of thing, but it is definately worth trying. The owner said in the spring they might add fish tacos to the menu so that would be something to look forward to try!"}
{"text":"Yum. There aren't many good places in Mississauga to stuff your face with delicious authentic Mexican food, but this definitely is one of them.   Very flavourful and nicely put together.   The service is a bit slow, so don't come if you're in a hurry. This is not a fast food place. You just have a few old ladies making you some delish food, while you chill with your friends having some drinks. In the summer you can hang out in their patio. During the cold months you have to squish in to the cozy indoors. It can get busy during dinner time, so come a bit earlier.  I definitely recommend it :)."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for genuine Mexican food in Sauga for a very long time. Unfortunately, my journey continues.  I went on a very, very quiet night! My family and I were literally the only ones there, along with the cranky owner. For just one table, the service was extremely slow that night.  The prices caught my eye the moment I looked at the menu. I don't think I've ever paid so much for such a small portion of Mexican food! My family and I shared a platter than had multiple Mexican dishes (enchiladas, chimichangas, tacos, etc.). We paid over $30 for our meal, and we ended up picking up congee at Golden Square afterwards because we were still hungry.   The food itself was decent. The only complaint I have is that the nachos are sort of soggy, everything was drench in a lot more sauce than necessary, and most of the food was lukewarm (or, not as warm as I'm usually accustomed to).   I'm glad I tried this, but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Food was ok. I ordered the perogies for an appetizer and 2 beef tacos for dinner.  Food was just ok. Service was extremely slow and the restaurant was not busy. Glad I tried it but wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Once my favourite place for Mexican food in Mississauga and not feeling to go anymore. Reasons: attitude of lady owner, down graded food quality."}
{"text":"we've been here a few times but it isn't what it used to be. last time we came we were disappointed with the portion sizes and the taste of our meals. we brought along 4 kids and the owner wasn't very nice to them. we won't ever go back."}
