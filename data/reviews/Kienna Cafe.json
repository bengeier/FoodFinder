{"text":"By far the best coffee in Kensington. Locally roasted in Calgary and also available at really good prices in the shop.    It amuses me that Higher Ground across the road just won best coffee shop in a poll, since their reciprocate coffee is just dreadful.  As for the people that go to Starbucks instead of a good local business, no comment."}
{"text":"A customer was sitting on the couch talking loudly on the phone with her bare feet propped onto the table. I complained to the barista behind the bar and she said \"she's a regular and there's nothing she can do.\"   I then called the cafe several times to speak to the owner about my visit, they never returned my call. Poor customer service. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Kienna Cafe is just what the Kensington Doctor* ordered. It's a social space for getting together for conversation over a cup of everyone's favourite caffeinated beverage. Unlike Higher Ground across the street, Kienna is a local roaster so they're a little more into the coffee side of things and a little less into the food. They currently have a small selection of muffins and scones, but a good chat with the very friendly owner, Rob, has told me that they will be including some tasty takeaway items very soon.  There's a sunny window bar along the front which is perfect for people watching or plunking down with your laptop for a few. Some couches toward the back make a comfortable setting for some leisurely chats.    The Kensington Doctor is purely fictional. If there is a real \"Kensington Doctor\" he/she did not actually order Kienna Cafe, and does not necessarily endorse this review... Although they should!"}
{"text":"When I walked in the door, they were immediately friendly. The owner even came by to introduce himself. The coffee was pretty good and I like that they roast their own beans. I wish they had more food options, but the croissant I had paired with the latte nicely. I sat in a plush chair near the front which was comfortable and cozy. The music definitely added to the relaxing ambiance, I really enjoyed the jazz that they were playing."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to Kensington! Drinks are hot and done right and the space is perfect for catching up with a friend or getting some work done. This is my new go to instead of the very over-crowded Higher Ground.  I had the Mocha and it was made right with soy and half sweet. Staff were friendly and service was quick. Seriously, how is this place not that busy?"}
{"text":"I like that it's been refashioned from The Coffee Market as a proper cafe with your choice of espresso, V60 pourover, aeropress, or french press. I also like the good selection of coffee gear and I picked up a 40 pack of V60 filters for 20% off special. I also like that they have a Macap doserless and grind to order, carefully tamp and pull nice looking shots for the iced Americano I got (I wanted cold brew but there isn't one, yet).  What I didn't particularly like, unfortunately, was the coffee. I could smell the charred bean smell as it was grinding and it's unmistakably a Starbucks-level roast level. That's horrible, to my taste at least- destroys any character of the bean. Brightness was completely extinguished. I get that some customers like dark, still, but why not shoot for a full city (like what Good Earth has settled on) instead of this Starbucks-esque charcoal? Are Kienna beans any good? Nobody knows. All you can taste is carbon.  I know not everybody wants the aggressively light roasted beans of many modern roasters, but the alternative isn't to burn them to hell like you guys are doing. If you work on this I might be back. If not, I'll continue to pray that a decent coffee place comes to Kensington, especially since Monogram has moved its popup from Crave to the soon to open Made By Marcus on 17th. When Hexagon opens across the street serving Fratello, I hope you folks adapt."}
{"text":"They could be more passionate about the coffee, but they're probably one of the fancier coffee shops in Kensington. No Analog or Phil and Sebastian's though."}
