{"text":"Came visit recently from a coupon purchase.  Right at we walked in, the server is very nice and put us in a quiet corner.  She did give us very detailed info about the food we ordered.  We ordered the salmon and Jerk Chicken.  Came out the dishes were exact what she told us.  The spice and sauce on chicken is juicy and delicious.  You got what you paid for.  Down side is hidden in a corner and traffic is always a constraint in the area."}
{"text":"Truly an international menu. Tried the crispy calamri and  butter chicken most recently and had the steak previously. Great atmosphere and servers have been attentive both times. Will need to try one of their burgers next as descriptions seem appetizing."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, food, and atmosphere!!!  Excellent group dinner experience.  Brought the entire hockey team and their family's there after our tournament and they served all 60+ of us without a hitch.  

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Menu was very simple and easy to understand. Ordered sweet potato fries & champion's breakfast. The food was nothing out of the ordinary. However our waitress was not very attentitive to us, had to ask another waitress to get her."}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend for late night snack and drinks during the week. I have to say that I really liked how friendly waitresses were. Very attentive and gave us many suggestions. I don't drink, but my friend loved their beer on draft. We got 3 appetizers and they all were really nice. Overall they offer typical bar food with some signature dish options. Will come back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I got the salmon cooked to perfection with their unbelievably insanely tasteful sauce they add to it just wow !!"}
{"text":"I went into this place without knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Great looking room, good service and reasonable prices. We had a drink and an appetizer so I can't speak to the entrees but the wings we had were excellent. I hope this place catches on because it's a good addition to an area where there are too many big box chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I've had this spot bookmarked for since I saw them come on Yelp in October/November of last year. I was rolling through the neighbourhood today when their sign (hidden behind a Denny's) caught my eye, in a plaza just near Rutherford and Jane in Vaughan (across from WEGZ).

I popped open Yelp to get a feeling for the place and the reviews really didn't have much positive to say about this spot. Undeterred and looking to build my own opinion about Sparks as a new locally owned business, I pulled in and parked. 

The venue has all sorts of Wow-factors aesthetically from when you first walk in. As only we can do in the 'burbs the ceilings were ultra-high with magnificent light fixtures.The restaurant has that similar open kitchen + clean/sexy design as you'd come to expect from a Moxies/Joeys/Browns Socialhouse (Oakville). But given the location, I think this is a nice spot to add some sophistication to the area.

It was empty when I arrived, save for one table, so I asked to sit at the bar to have a quick drink, order some food and do a bit of work before moving on. Staff were friendly and seated me, before excusing themselves so that they could have the bartender come out and serve.

The cocktail menu and beer list weren't anything special (big brands, no craft/local beer) and a very sugar drink based list of cocktails (mojitos, etc). These kinds of cocktails \"used\" to be the standard but in the midst of a cocktail renaissance across the 416/905 I expected to see the classic cocktail standards on the menu (negroni, old fashioned, manhattan, martini, etc). This would be my main critique and piece of constructive criticism here. 

That said, I DID order an Old Fashioned off-menu and with a little direction (use Bourbon, not Crown Royal) the bartender pulled off a pretty good version. The skill is definitely there, she did great!

For food, I was trying to be healthy, which in Vaughan is difficult with all the Italian and BBQ options everywhere. Sparks seems to have a great signature ethnic dish to cater to many tastes as well as select chop house options. Sticking to my healthy guns I went with the bartender's recommendation of the Kale Krunch salad. Wanting a bit more protein I asked for a chicken breast to be added and for some spice some jerk sauce on the side.

The salad was really great, a solid mix of kale, veggies, crispy wonton style noodles and for the amount you get in the bowl $10.25 was a super reasonable price. The chicken was cooked great as well and the jerk sauce was flavourful with a nice kick but not too hot (for me).

Unfortunately, I had to hit the road and didn't get to enjoy a coffee or dessert option (probably for the best and my diet) but from what I saw I actually enjoyed. It's definitely a great Date Night spot in Vaughan with their many high-backed leather booths. I'll look forward to returning here in the summer when their patio opens, hopefully, I'll get to add that deserved 5th star after trying more of their menu out and seeing some changes to their cocktail + beer menu!

Looking forward to my next visit!

Eatcrest, Out!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner and service was so slow. The place wasn't even busy and it took over a half hour just to get our drinks. Food was OK. Then another half hour wait to get our coffees which arrived cold.  Will definitely not be returning. Better options to choose in the Maple area."}
{"text":"Food: 1/5 only ordered appetizers & drinks... appetizers were all dry, and over cooked. Really nothing special and quite unappetizing.. reminded me of cafeteria food. Lychee martini was very sweet and artificial tasting. 
Service: 2/5 our server was snobby and didn't know anything about the menu. We also came here with a Groupon... servers & manager took more than 30 min to figure out how to redeem their own groupon. 
Ambiance: 4/5 nice decor, very modern, and trendy.. doesn't not make up for the poor food and service tho! 
Overall experience: 2/5.. I did not enjoy my time here. Menu prices are expensive too. Lots of better options in this area!"}
{"text":"I had a 15% off coupon laying around so I decided to pay this place a visit.

This massive establishment is divided into two areas: Bar area and booths area. In the bar area you are surrounded by massive TVs and loud speakers and everyone there is watching the game. The booths area is perfect for those who prefer to just sit in a comfy booth and dine. Something for everyone. Perfect for booking events.

Decent food menu. Both their veggie burgers and onion rings are vegan. Very tasty food. Great portions. Prices are about the same as any sports bar. Friendly staff. 15% off coupon was honored.

Overall it was a great night. It's definitely one of the greatest sports bar in the area and I'm surely coming back."}
{"text":"Made a rsvp and showed up on time. Our table (last table available) was given to a family who walked in few seconds ahead of us who didn't make any rsvp.  We ended up waiting 20 mins for our seats.  Ordered appetizer calamari for $12.50 and the huge plate showed up with 8-9 pieces in total.  The medium rare steak we ordered was well done.  Sever was nice thought and helped us exchange and kept checking up on us.  Should have went to Denny's next door who charge half the price but with double the portion."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out on my daughters insistence.
Nice looking interior and a menu that was rather limited and overly priced given that many local places specialize in much of the cuisine they offer at a much better price point. For example, jerk chicken entree for $27!?!? Island mix offers a much more generous portion and more authentic for only $14!
I ordered a pint of Canadian for $7.25 and disappointed that the glass was not properly filled. We ordered the calamari crunch app, burger entree, and the lamb coconut curry.
The calamari was $12 bucks and rather sparse given that Marcello's has a much generous portion for about the same price--would not recommend this dish. 
The burger was tasty and worth the $14 had the waitress not dropped the ketchup dish and ruined my leather shoes!
The lamb curry came with naan, rice, and raita. The flavor was good but it had no curry!! The lamb was cut into pieces that are too small which disappointed me, especially for $18!! 
We were approached by the manager who appreciated the feedback and while she tried to fix the dish which I declined, I hope they remember to add more curry or get rid of the naan. A complimentary pint was given to improve my experience and appreciated.
Would I return? No. There are better options with more value for your dollar nearby."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my cousins birthdays as 5 of them were born in May lol. We made reservations and upon arrival, a table was ready for us. We were a group of 11 including two kids and a baby, so I'd say we were a rowdy bunch. 

Food: we ordered the flaming calamari to share. We all wanted to try this dish mostly because of it getting lit on fire first. The dish itself was tasty but a tad on the salty side. 
Everyone ordered different entrees but the response was all the same, \"The food was okay... but a little on the pricey side though.\" 

Service: Our server was extremely pleasant, attentive, and provided excellent customer service. also, I was really surprised and impressed with how well he handled my little niece and baby cousin as they can be a little bratty sometimes. 

I was also surprised with how child friendly this place is. There's a kids menu that doubled as a colouring page and kids were also given crayons to colour. I also thought my table would've been the only one with a screaming baby but we actually had competition lol. 

Decor: The restaurant definitely has a bar and grill restaurant look and ambiance but it is definitely family friendly. 

While the food was only decent, I would definitely give it another try, maybe next time with friends or my partner instead of family and children lol."}
{"text":"Sparks is still trying to figure themselves out.  The interior is a combination of upscale restaurant and sports bar.  Because it is new, it also feels clean and comfortable.  The food quality does not excite and the prices are such that I would expect more in quality, presentation and service.  The folks are well meaning but just a bit lost since start up.  Hope they find themselves."}
{"text":"This place is ok. In a small town or area with less options it would probably shine but in this area it's kind of forgettable.

Food's ok. Service is nice. Decor's ok. Beer selection is decent.

I'm trying to muster more description but really this is the epitome of \"fine\"."}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming, it was just a lot of a situation so definitely needed to be addressed. We came because we saw it was a new place we'd never heard of and wanted to try. I don't know if offended is the right word, but definitely unprofessional all the way around. 

Beginning of the experience we hadn't been there so we asked a few questions about recommendations, both the waitress and manager Ming contradicted themselves at EVERY aspect of our questions. 1: what would u recommend. \"Bla bla bla jerk chicken is good\", what wouldn't u get?: jerk chicken. WHAT?! Okay, nevermind on that. 

Then with the food which wasn't good at all. Friend got the souvlaki, I customed my order in which I got a chicken sandwich turned into a burger, and my boyfriend got the sparks burger. Burger was meh, dryish. Souvlaki was REALLY DRY. My food was the best which wasn't saying much because it was good because of the flavours I chose but sure. 

Manager kept coming up to us to see how we were doing which I'd usually say is a plus point, but no. First rule, DO NOT SWEAR TO UR CUSTOMERS. Second rule, my name is my name, not \"baby girl\". Literal words that came out of his mouth when we were talking to him saying about promoting the place, \"I'm lazy maybe in the summer\" Then he says that they're gunna rebuild the menu and add \"crap\" to make money such as jalapeño poppers n stuff. N I'm like okay he just needs to leave at this point. 

Another point to make is the waitress made me feel super not confident about myself. Our friend was dressed in a suit bc of what he did that day, asks him what the occasion is because we're just \"whatever\". Excuse me I came from work rushed to put my makeup on and I don't feel very good being called \"whatever\". Overall, the people that work here need to learn customer service and how to speak to people."}
{"text":"Food came out hot, tasty, and the portions are good. Several tv's and large screen at the bar to watch the game, atmosphere is live. I would give it 5 stars but  we came at a Saturday night and  they might have been short staff because it took a while for the food to come out; we were a group of 10"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 7 o'clock and when we got there at 655 we were informed that they do not have a table for us as a larger reservation of 55 people was made later in the day thus bumping us.

After some complaining and waiting 20 minutes we were seated .

Ordered nachos ( fully loaded ) which we were told would be plenty for 4 people - great disappointment ! Cheese was not melted on the nachos and the portions were half of what they were serving the party of 55.

My wife and son both enjoyed the salmon dinner and BBQ Hamburger - they were served hot and well prepared. I ordered the chicken stir fry - my rice was cold and the chicken was almost non existent. 

The server did not bring us water when we requested it and brought us the wrong bill when we were ready to leave. 

Would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Disappointing.
I've noticed this place for a while now and decided that this would be a good day to try their brunch. Wish I would have gone to Denny's instead.
When we arrived (around 11am on a Sunday morning), the place was fairly quiet....maybe two or three other tables were occupied. We were seated right away and left their brunch menu. The brunch menu was fairly basic and straight forward.
Our server took our drink order and when she returned (without an asked for glass of water...which had to be asked for again later), we place our order. I ordered French toast with a side of sausage, my partner ordered a vegetarian skillet (think poutine but with potatoes, eggs, cheese, mushrooms, green peppers and hollandaise sauce on the side).
My French toast consisted on 3 slices of white bread, with sliced bananas, strawberry (1) and two thin slices of cantaloupe. There was nothing outstanding about this dish. The sausage, while plump, were tasteless.
My partner said his skillet was good...but not worth the price point.
Despite being very quiet in the restaurant, our dirty dishes sat in front of us for far too long.
Herein lies their problem....with Denny's next door (and their enormous menu), there's nothing on this menu that would bring me back. 
So while it wasn't dreadful...it was a disappointment.
Bkfst for 2, with 1 coffee, tea...tax and tip came to just under $40.
Don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ummm. It's just another grill and bar. The staff was friendly but distant If you prefer that kind of thing. Was meeting up some friends and the place was kind of empty. So we had the choice of seating. I would not recommend the squid rings. It was still frozen and soggy."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday (group of six). We ordered a drink for each of us, a platter (to share), a pizza (to share), and a main for each of us. We each paid roughly $45 each totalling about $270 worth of food and drink. This is a relatively expensive place. Mains average around $21 per plate, appetizers around $11 a plate. 

Our server was great. She was very friendly and attentive; came back to check on us multiple times throughout the night to make sure we were doing OK.

We were thoroughly unimpressed by the appetizers. The fried items on the platter were _very_ oily and the pizza was bland. Our mains were extremely salty, to the point where it was inedible. All six of us were unable to take more than two bites before we had to stop.

The manager (Ming) came over to ask us how we were doing and we informed him about the food. He tells us that their head chef had quit a few days prior, and there has been a sabotage in the kitchen and tells us \"it is what it is\".

When it came time for the bill, we asked the manager for a discount because none of us could eat our food. He asks us to \"flip a coin for it\". Confused, we all start looking for a coin when he says \"I'm just fucking with you\". He explains about the sabotage again and says \"it is what it is\" before disappearing to the back. We assume that he went to go print us new bills with a discount, but 15 minutes pass and we don't see him. Our server comes to check in on us, and she has no idea what is happening, and we have to explain to her the situation. Only then do we get our new bills with 10% off -- enough for half of a beer.

Our server also informs us that no one in the kitchen had quit, and that the entire staff is putting up with this manager's attitude towards them.

TL;DR: According to the manager there is a sabotage in the kitchen, so everything tastes like a bucket of salt. It is what it is."}
{"text":"I found sparks through a Yelp event.

The service was very good.  We were seated quickly and drinks quickly followed.

The place  is well furnished, and there was a good variety on the menu.

I have to eat a gluten free menu, and it was a treat to eat here as they had many options.

I had the ultra burger.  I had a choice of a gluten free bun, but I typically order my burgers without a bun.

This was a very well laid out meal.  The plate looked good.  Very well sculpted salad and the burger with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and mushrooms was probably one of the best burgers that I have had in the las three to four years.

The place was nice, the place was very clean, and the service was top notch.

I will be back.  5 stars."}
{"text":"The bar is open late North of 7.  Finally a local restaurant open till midnight every day.

Love the menu. 
Everything from burgers and wings. 
To the pizza. 

Most things are house made. 

And on the flip side we have monster meals with steaks, pasta, chicken and so much more. 

Kids love the food and Sundays kids eat free. 

Wine, beer and full bar. 

Looking forward to the patio."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for a birthday dinner. Really liked the decor of the restaurant. We were seated in a booth which I appreciated as it felt more secluded and intimate with my friends.

The food we ordered was decent. We were recommended the flaming calamari vs. the calamari crunch because our waiter said it was a signature item and tasted excellent. However, when we received it, the dish was very salty and there wasn't anything special about it. Tasted a lot like Chinese stir fry. The only thing special about it was when they serve the dish, they pour some alcohol into it and make the dish \"flame\" in fire.

We also got the souvlaki chicken flatbread which was very plain. It was just flatbread topped off with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and tzaziki sauce. One dish that tasted great and we all liked was the special that they offered that night (seafood pasta with lobster tail). The pasta had a great aroma of seafood taste to it, so we all liked it a lot. 

Overall, the service we received was excellent but the food was mediocre. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to this new place for a while now since they opened, so today marks my first visit, and probably my last!
This place is so convenient, as it's close to my residence, but I was not that impressed at all.
Starting with the decor and setup, the place is a bit confusing, the exterior ives me an impression of a high end sports bar, but once you go in, you wouldn't know where you at! You might be in a sports bar? A fine dining? A family restaurant?
Then on to a confused menu without an actual category/cuisine, a bit Italian, to sandwiches, to burgers, to fine steaks to pizzas to Indian dishes? You guys should think about it, find a certain path and stick to it.

Now to the food quality, which is \"just about okay\", portions ate also okay but not too big , which is expected from a sports bar setup? Taste is very mediocre.
Also prices are not cheap! Our bill came up to over $50 per person! With no alcohol, which is tooo steep for a place like this.

Service is the worst part of the whole experience, all staff seem amateur and too young to handle this restaurant...
The host was professional and friendly, but the waiter was not, he was unprofessional and not friendly at all..
He even had to say NO to replacing french fries with onion rings on an appetizer! Then after telling him to go check he went and came back saying okay, but we'll charge you $2!! Comeon!! A brand new place, you should be building up your customer base rather than nickelling and dimeing!!
Another part is the girls' uniform at this place which is very inappropriate for a family dining restaurant, if that's their target crowd at least!
Unfortunately, would not visit back!"}
{"text":"I would give them 41/2 stars, tried this place through a Groupon and was very pleased with the service and food.  It is really nice looking for a sports bar themed restaurant and the fish and chips special was really tasty, good portion size and crispy! I heard Sunday is a busy night and they do kids eat free, we will be heading back."}
{"text":"Went here for the 'get layd' Yelp event and as a regular customer one night.

Although I'm not a drinker, my friends have said that they have an incredible selection of drinks, both heavy and casual. The food was great! The 'Flaming Calamari' was their premium dish and although its just a copy from EVERY Greek restaurant, it was still fabulous. The food was very good, fair price and the restaurant, although new, looked like the hip spot in Vaughan. I do feel bad for them because the plaza they are situated in does not look popular, but I do hope they can turn it around :)

GO TO THIS PLACE! It's a great place with friends and if the weather ever decides to cooperate with us, the patio is sure to be bumpin' all summer long."}
{"text":"Terrible service mediocre food. We made reservations but the table was given to people who didn't have reservations. Took forever for the food to arrive. Asked for a medium rare steak the steak came as well done and even after they gave us a new one it was still over cooked. The calamari was very expensive for only a few pieces. Nothing impressed me. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love sparks. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and it is fast service and good food. We have been twice now. The first time the service was just ok but the second time, the waiter was incredible. He was really friendly and nice to the kids. We got the special - fish and chips and was really delicious.

I gave it a 4 because we used a groupon and the manager included a 20 percent gratuity and did not tell me. I left the waiter a 20 percent gratuity anyway. Thankfully the waiter was very honest and told me about it after and refunded the money I paid on top of the 20 percent charged. If he did not tell me, I would have left a 40 percent gratuity! I can't recall my bill on the first time I attended but I hope I was not charged twice then also. 

Still a great place but CHECK YOUR BILL TWICE cause they add 20 percent gratuity"}
