{"text":"With the proliferation of westernized Japanese fast food all over Toronto, it's hard to not dismiss square fish as a novelty. But you will be wise to give this small restaurant a try. My friends and I tried the square sushi, unagi bowl and I had the doshi.

The square sushi is a little on the pricey side at $12. Flavors are light and the rice is soft and fluffy. If you're not a fan of lightly seasoned food you may not like this place. With that in mind I wouldn't recommend this dish or get it again. 

The small unagi bowl and doshi however are a must try. If you enjoy poke bowls, think of the unagi bowl as a more Japanese variation. The bowl has the same soft rice as the sushi with unagi of course. You also get a healthy dose of edamame, seaweed, lettuce and ginger. I may have missed some ingredients but I think you get the point. More Japanese style sides are added to the bowl. I'm not sure if you can yocustomize it, but a small bowl will set you back $8 and will definitely fill you.

Now the doshi. Clearly I saved the best for last. When I saw it, I thought really donut sushi ? First burrito and now donut? This is just another novelty that will die. But it's the most interesting looking thing and only one way to find it. 

It was incredible. I got the salmon doshi,l coming in at $9 the salmon sits on top with the avocado giving this a very distinct look. Smart move to put the salmon on top and not a \"bun\". Inside you get your veggies, seaweed, letttuce, cucumber, corn and small salmon patty. At the bottom the bun you get is fried with rice and a bit of cheese inside. The suttle flavors work well together in giving it a Japanese experience in the form of a donut. Square fish has done a great job in capturing the essence behind a Japanese dish in a westernized form. 

The place is a bit small. But the staff is friendly and the place is very clean. On top of that the service is really quick, living up to the fast food culture. 

TL;DR If you're unsure if you want to try a sushi burrito or sick of that whole trend, I highly recommend you come to square fish and give the doshi a try."}
{"text":"This tiny spot is a hidden gem! 

I've had a take out multiple times and it was always as great as the first time.

Their doshi blows my mind. It simply tastes amazing with all the flavors and fresh ingredients mixed together. But keep in mind, it's very messy to deal with.

Sushi burrito are also very flavorful and fresh. The half portion is huge and is more than enough to make me full. 

I like how quality and quantity are always consistent at this place. Portions are quite big, comparing to similar options in the area, while prices are fair for  the amount you get. The service is super polite and friendly.

Definitely will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is quite was quite a pleasant experience.  First time trying the doshi (donut+sushi) so can't really compare but all I know is I'll definitely be back! We ordered the tuna and salmon doshi combo which came with a doshi and 3 prices of square sushi (you can pay extra if you want swap it out for different pieces).  The combo was fair in price ($13) considering you are downtown, though there isn't a lot of fish the quality of the fish is quite fresh. Space is very limited here, if you're planning to bring a group of friends here for lunch, you might need to get take out."}
{"text":"As i saw this on instagram and seeing this is a new sushi trend. I decided to try it. The place was nicely decorated and the walls had cute paintings. It is a very clean restaurant and i decided to try it today with my friend. I had combo 2 which was half a sushi burrito, 3 square sushi and a choice of taro chips or salad for 12$ plus tax. The presentation of the food was nice, but the food was not great. The sushi burrito and the 3 square sushi barely had any taste and the fish was not fresh. Eating it the burrito was messy as the seaweed did not cover the bottom of the burrito and it was wrapped with the paper wrap instead. Another thing is, one of the tables was too short while sitting on the chairs. The chair was way higher than the table making it awkward to eat. As nice as the place looks and the presentation of the food, the food is not great. I really wished it was better, but it turned out to be disappointing."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant with great food! I ordered the large salmon and tuna poke box (around $15) and it was definitely worth it compared to other poke places downtown. There was a generous amount of fish and vegetables. The service was very polite and quick. Would definitely come back to try the other items!"}
{"text":"the most aesthetically pleasing sushi place i've been to. the service is good and the combo deal is really great - includes 3 sushi squares, a sushi donut (doshi) and a kale salad! the sushi is fresh and worth it!"}
{"text":"New favorite dish, Doshi !  I guess it stands for Donut Sushi? I love salmon, so i tried salmon doshi. Rich flavor and very delicious. It's definitely worth to try."}
{"text":"Had the blow torched shrimp and salmon sushi. The salmon was fresh but the pieces of salmon and shrimp were really thin. The shrimp was nothing special and I wouldn't recommend it. The rice was cold and kind of hard. 

Nice service and cute / clean spot. Probably wouldn't return as there are a lot of other options in the area."}
{"text":"I came here in late December in the early evening. There are only two tables [each with only two seats] so if it's busy, expect to get takeout. We tried [everything they had] the 1 Burrito, 2 Doshis and the set of signature Square Sushis.

The burrito was okay, a bit on the small side from what we are used to from Rollatation, Su & Bu and Sushitto. It was good, though.

The Square Sushis were not worth it at all. They were overstuffed with rice and minimal fish [and beets?]. I would recommend just going to a typical good sushi place and getting good sushi with a good mix of the fillings and everything.

Now, the Doshis! They are actually incredible. They are less of a sushi donut and completely a sushi burger. The mixture of fried cheese stuffed rice with the fish/shrimp and seaweed salad and corn and everything in between was amazing! They are completely worth it [despite being messy to eat]."}
{"text":"A very unique take on Sushi! There are a million identical sushi places in Toronto, but this tiny one stands out

I got the doshi combo, which features their signature sushi donut, which is more like a burger. top ring if rice with tuna, middle is lettuce, more tuna, shredded crab meat, spicy mayo, and bottom is a fried rice ring with cheese in the middle. Square sushi pieces on the side were also unique. 

Definitely going back, though they could use a bigger space. If this was a fullsized restaurant it would the hot restaurant to try."}
{"text":"Bought the small size spicy salmon burrito, tastes great, reasonable price, nice service"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced compared to other poke/sushi burrito places! Great taste, will definitely try more! They have a lot to offer on their menu and they have unique items like doshi (sushi in a shape of a donut). I had the spicy salmon bowl with kale and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"A very cozy and cute joint for sushi donuts. I ended up getting the half size salmon poke bowl substitute siracha sauce with classic poke sauce and soba. It was delightfully refreshing except the soba was soggy. Will return again and hope the soba will be fresher next time."}
{"text":"Delicious poke bowls. Fresh salmon. The sushi rice tasted a little off, though. Very little seating so it's best as a grab and go place."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy salmon roll (not spicy) and square fish. The presentation is cute but the sushi wasn't anything special. After reading a few reviews, it seems the Doshi is worth trying, however my review is based on the other items."}
{"text":"I've tried many poke bowl spots and this one definitely hit the target! First off, Square Fish has many unique food options such as their square sushi, donut sushi and kale noodle offerings. Decided to stay on the safe side and try their poke bowl and it did not disappoint me...that much.  

I would like to start off and say that everyone likes their poke bowls differently. So, I would recommend everyone to try out a few with equally high ratings and see which style they like most. For me, I like my poke bowls with even ratios of rice, fish, and topping. Honestly, this place lacked in that area. I was overwhelmed with the amount of toppings, especially the unpleasant kale, and the lack of actual raw fish. I like my fish chunky and juicy, so Square Fish didn't suit my needs. 

I ordered the Spicy Salmon and Tuna and the flavour was excellent. Fish tasted fresh and the sauces were delicious! So this place is worth trying, just to see what type of poke bowls you prefer. I have friends who swear by this place as it's one of their favourites while I would rather go to Pokito across the street. 

This place is really small and quaint, so don't expect to have seating there. They also give out free lemon water which is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I know. You're kinda getting tired to these sushi hybrids. But I am certain you haven't had the Doshi yet! Never mind the sushi burrito. They're everywhere right now. Go for the Doshi. I found this place through Blog TO. Here's their wonderful description: \"Two rings of sushi rice, the bottom one wrapped in cheese and deep-fried until crispy, sandwich a harmonious combo of lettuce, seaweed salad, classic sauce, mango, edamame, spicy mayo, corn, and tuna.

That's topped with tuna, avocado and sesame. Square fish recommends slapping parchment paper down on your palm and eating it like a burger.\"

It was REALLY good! Different flavours and textured really working well together. A party in your mouth if you could imagine. Better yet, just do it and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Squarefish! I ordered the Salmon Doshi combo to go. I had a very nice conversation with the cashier after ordering and was able to watch them assemble orders with their fresh ingredients while I waited. A short wait later, I was given a cute little to go box stuffed to the brim with food. I chose Taro chips as my side and the doshi came with a trio of their square sushi. The doshi was a little hard to eat, but that is to be expected - the flavors had me making sure I got every last bite. 

I will definitely return next time I'm in Toronto and would recommend this location to anyone looking for good \"trendy\" sushi!"}
{"text":"Super cute little place! Staff is super friendly. The food came a bit slow but everything was made to order so it makes sense.

I had the first combo with a doshi (tuna) and square sushi. The sushi was okay, nothing special, but I really did enjoy the doshi. Very flavourful and filling. Clever they put the paper under the doshi, so you can more easily wrap it and eat it after taking a million photos.;)
  definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Tuna Sushi Burrito was delicious! My only regret is getting the half size. Can't wait to come back to try more."}
{"text":"Doshi will be the next short-lived food trend, I just know it.

With so many food options near our hotel, Square Fish stood out because of its newness and strong profile. Donut sushi called doshi?? Who wouldn't be able to resist. With no wait, we took the server's rec and ordered a salmon doshi.

Preparation was decently fast and our picture perfect snack was a sight to be seen. It looked more like a burger with sushi rice buns, and the eating experience was something else. We warned how messy it'd be and she wasn't kidding. The bun instantly fell apart when we tried to handle it and I'd recommend using the wrapper to wrap it up and keep it together.

Flavor-wise, I was very very impressed. It was more of a poke experience versus a sushi experience. There was a strong emphasis on salads and toppings versus the actual fish. The seaweed and crab salads were quite tasty, but I wished there was more fish. The sandwich ultimately costs $7ish USD, which I thought was more than fair for the portion.

Snack in and grab one before your Instagram floods with photos of them!"}
{"text":"Saw a picture of the sushi on instagram and had to check this place out. 

I've been meaning to write this review earlier. Came here in late December, the place was so new you could still smell the paint on the wall. The décor was is simple, lots of white tile.

The place is super tiny only seating about 4 people. There is nowhere to put your jackets, so I would suggest that they get a coat rack for people wanting to sit down and eat there. It's definitely more takeout, than dine in place.

The staff were pretty friendly and helpful. They checked to see if we liked the food. I got one of their special boxes that included their signature salmon & shrimp Doshi (donut/burger), seaweed salad, and 3 square sushi. My favourite was the Doshi, the fish was fresh and everything worked well together. I liked the bottom rice bun, which was nice and crispy. Not only is it really cute and nice to look at, but delicious as well. It's a bit messy to eat, but a fun concept. If there is one thing on the menu you should try I would recommend this. Out of the square sushi I enjoyed the salmon and shrimp ones more.

The prices here are reasonable. If you are looking for a different type of sushi I would suggest trying out this place. 

Sadly when I came the only fish they had was the shrimp and salmon, no scallop. 

They do have smaller sized burritos, which is nice and means you can try other things.

For dessert you can always go check out Butter Avenue down the street."}
{"text":"Small store with seating for 10. Tables are basically work benches with stools. There's a small potted (real) plant sitting on the bench, which is kind of cute.

I ordered Combo #1, which by default comes with a donut sushi (aka: doshi), 3 square sushi, and your choice of taro chips or seaweed salad. However, there are some customization options that aren't listed on the menu

1. By default, the sushi are \"chef's choice\", which means most of them don't come with fish. If you would like to have fish in all of them, you can add an extra $1. If you would like them all to come with torched fish, it will be an extra $1.50.

2. They have a \"secret\" item that isn't listed on the menu (but is showcased at the counter) that they call a \"doshi top\" which is literally just...a rice donut with crispy shell with fish and other things laid on top. You can bargain to substitute the doshi with two of these (which come at $5 a piece)

Food takes some time to prepare; about 5-6 minutes. If you choose to dine-in, they will present it on a nice dish and bring it over to your bench. They will also provide a tutorial on how to consume the doshi in such a way that will minimize the mess. However, of course, I just dug in with a pair of chopsticks and ate it layer by layer.

The doshi itself looks interesting, but the rice is pretty hard. Can't tell if there's just not enough water when they cooked it, or the type of rice they use. It's actually kind of filling despite the size, because of all the things that go into it. There isn't as much fish as I was expecting, and most of it is vegetables or rice.

The square sushi that comes with the combo are pretty flat and don't look like the ones shown in the pictures. I don't know if these are \"half\" sushi's, but it's definitely not cube shaped. There also isn't much in them since they're so flat, so I think them being squares instead of circles is their main selling point.

The taro chips were good. Nice and crispy.

Overall, can't say I'd pay $15+ for it (given that the doshi itself is $10), but it's interesting to try it once I guess."}
{"text":"First visit: Tried the cute little square sushi sampler platter. It was very photogenic, but nothing special. 
Second visit: Tried the salmon poke bowl full size and was pleasantly surprised, but not wowed.
Third visit: Tried the tempura poke bowl and this has to be my favourite lunch in the area now. It has the perm feet blend of rice, kale, seaweed salad, edamame, sauce, crab slaw, and large shrimps. I ate half at lunch and the other half before my after work fitness class, and it was perfect. I will definitely be back here for more! Good value for fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Both presentation and customer service were above and beyond. Quality of ingredients were pretty good and seafood tasted fresh."}
{"text":"You don't come here for your best cut of sashimi. You come here for the fun of eating doshi and square sushi! 

While I think the food quality is mediocre, I applaud square fish for their originality. There are too many ayce sushi or mediocre salmon rolls in Toronto. So it's nice to see something new and different. At least they try to take average salmon and create it into something fun. 

Service is superb!! 

There are many food options on queen west, if you are in the area, give square fish a try!"}
{"text":"This spot is squeezed in, between many other food options, and you could easily walk by, it's so small and narrow. There's hardly any seats inside, in fact, I think only 4 or 5 people can sit inside.

They only opened for a week or two when I went in for lunch with a friend. The service was friendly and helpful. We ordered the Signature Sushi which is 8 pieces of sushi (two salmon, one shrimp, one tuna and two California, one beer and one tofu) and a doshi each (salmon and tuna). If you don't know what a doshi is, that is what you need to visit this venue for. A doshi is a doughnut shaped sushi.

It's basically like a burger and it's super flavourful! The sushi was pretty, but not as much of an impact in terms of flavour. The doshi was tricky to eat. The staff served it on a piece of paper and said we should wrap it up and eat it like a burger. For the most part, this worked. I would have liked a bowl for all the little pieces that broke apart, so I could eat those up with a spoon or something later, instead of making my face a new work of art. Still, I know I'm a messy eater, and getting food on my face is better than in my hair hahaha.

Good thing most people just came in for take out due to the limited seating. No one got scarred from by my food face ;)
I'm definitely coming back for the doshis... for all of them doshis! They also have burritos. I know these are popular around the city but I have yet to try any. Maybe I shall try one next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Friend told me to come with her and I wasn't disappointed. The meal came really quick and it was delicious. 

I got the spicy tuna and salmon bowl. It was kind of like Chipotle's burrito bowl but even better. They really picked good fish for their ingredients and they're sides it came with was great. 

All in all would come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the small Dynamite Shrimp Poke Bowl and at first I was hesitant if it would be worth the money (especially for the size). Not only was it filling, but I couldn't finish it!

I'm a sucker for anything tempura though, which might be why I was swayed to give 5 stars. It's not the absolute best shrimp tempura I've had but it's up there.

There was a lot more salad in my bowl than rice, which I prefer, so I was really happy with that! I just wish there was more shrimp in the bowl, but even the lid couldn't close so I guess I can't really complain. 

The only troubles I had was that I couldn't mix my salad nor shake it because the bowl was so full. 

The workers were nice and worked as fast as they could. The menu isn't posted on a wall for all to see but rather in pamphlets that you can take from the counter. The place isn't really meant for dine-in so keep that in mind. 

I'd definitely go back to try other poke bowls!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place because of the novelty of the doshi (sushi donut). However, the taste/quality of the food isn't anything special. For about $15, you get a sushi donut, 3 pieces of square sushi, and a side salad or taro chips. The deep fried bottom of the doshi was a little hard but you the option to substitute the deep fried bottom with regular sushi rice. I would say the sushi is comparable to grocery store sushi. You definitely pay for the novelty and the experience. The store is quite small but I've never seen it full so you can typically find a spot. Definitely not a place I'm itching to go back to, but worth a try if you're all about the novelty."}
{"text":"Very sad that they changed the menu, I loved the sushi donut and would crave it regularly. Went in tonight and they no longer serve it. Won't be going back:( too many poke shops around used to like that they did something different ."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi joints downtown. Been wanting to try this place for a while now due to it's new concept (square pressed sushi and donut sushi). I came here for dinner on a Friday night around 8 and surprisingly it wasn't that busy. There is only a couple of tables in there so I would recommend take out if crowded. I got a chance to try a bit of everything - the salmon sushi donut , salmon sushi bowl with spicy mayo and signature 8 piece pressed sushi. The salmon donut was definitely a unique twist- deep fried rice with cheese at the bottom layer with crab salad, seaweed lettuce, avocado and of course salmon. It was a bit difficult to eat as it was huge. I loved the poke bowls, very flavourful and the sauce is amazing. The pressed sushi was very unique. I enjoyed the crab salad and torched salmon the most. Overall it was a great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumpalipadopicalistrociously delicious.

I can't contain my excitement as this place is a 30 second walk from the office. As the rise of the poke bowls and sushi wraps peak in popularity, there are tons of places to choose from for food. Squarefish has a modern designed logo and delicious bowls to offer!

Coming here on a weekday for lunch, Square Fish offers a half portion for the bowls (half of the container that it is served in), but this amount is actually WAY more than enough. These half bowls come to a before tax price of $10 ($6.50 to $9) range depending if you only want veggies or you want meat in it as well. If you want the full portions, it ranges from ($10 to $14). 

In the spicy salmon bowl, there was kale. LOTS or kale, which I actually don't like too much of. The bottom portion was filled with rice padded down, and it had bits of everything from taro chips, to seaweed salad, and of course the spicy salmon! 

I'm not sure if the sushi itself is worth it after seeing the price and the size of the sushi, but the bowls are definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"A nice little shop located along Queen Street West. It's a very tiny shop with no seating and you can easily miss it. I came here order the Chicken Katsu Bowl through Mealpal. The picture of the bowl was really appealing to me so I decided to order it. The Chicken Katsu bowl has Katsu chicken, avocado, tamago, mango, pickled carrot & daikon, red onion, crispy noodle, wonton crispy, with sriracha aioli & tonkatsu sauce. A very nice bunch of ingredients mixed into one bowl. Very delicious from the rice to the katsu, it was definitely one of more delicious bowls I've had. I was early to pickup my meal and it was already prepared. Staff were pretty nice. It's mostly a takeout place so don't expect to dine here as there's barely any room to sit or stand. Overall, a very good dish. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be back to try some of their other menu items! Great place for a quick bite that's delicious!"}
{"text":"This cute, little place honestly might be my favourite poke place in the city. Don't judge a book by its cover; this tiny place packs a big punch. 

We ordered a half bowl each and wondered why they called it half when it came pretty packed! It's just as big as any regular sized poke bowl you'll find but it's comes to under $10! I was impressed already. 

Flavour wise, it was just as good, if not better than those other guys. I really can't wait to stop by this place again."}
{"text":"First time here I got to sushi burrito, it was pretty good, compatible with sushito on dundas but it tastes a little different.
Second time here, I thought, what's better than having a poke bowl in a really hot day, when you need carbs for energy and you don't want any hot food.

This time i ordered scallop poke bowl, half the size for $8, I love scallops doesn't matter if it's cooked or raw as long as it's fresh. Reasonable price, overall the portions is perfect for a girl, the scallops are given more than I expected.
I dined in, small space but i felt very spacious and comfortable because not a lot of people were dining in. Very nice and polite staff, but the wait was a little too long for just putting ingredients together, waited 15 minutes.

 I personally don't like eating raw vegetables cause I'm not used to the after taste, I didn't know there will be so much kale!!! But it was fresh and nothing was bitter. Next time I'll definitely ask for no kale."}
{"text":"I appreciate square fish in trying to bring something new to Toronto. Well it's not really new in taste, just the shape. I'm always up to try new restaurants so I came just to see what the hype was. I didn't have high expectations since I was expecting average sushi but just in a new shape.

The poor review is because of the food. The sashimi is not fresh, everything tastes bland, the food is just not great for the price. 

Food:
Me and a friend ordered an 8pc assorted square sushi set and a small poke bowl. The poke bowl was mediocre, just like average poke bowl restaurants. Moving onto the square sushi, my first impression was that it looked messy. It did not look appetizing. I could see right away that there was a lot of rice and barely any sashimi. The square looks like it's falling apart. When me and my friend tried the square sushi, yes we realized there's more sashimi inside the sushi. But still, there is way too much rice for the tiny amount of sashimi in each sushi piece. Moreover, the sushi tastes super bland. It was just bad. 

I will not return to square sushi because their signature square sushi was extremely disappointing. It was bland and the only uniqueness was the shape of it. I'm not sure if this hype is good enough to sustain a sushi business in Toronto."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you will notice that it's quite tiny, and if the place actually gets really popular I am a little worried about the massive chaos they may have to deal with, and given my experience at Square Fish, I have a feeling it's gonna blow up when the weather warms up.

It is a modernized semi-sushi restaurant that's following the current trend of healthy food options with style. Their sushi comes in squares, they offer donut sushis - which are essentially large sushi burgers with a hole in the centre, sushi burritos and sushi bowls. I've tried a number of things from the menu and while I would not recommend the kimchi beef (it's raw beef, and too mushy for my liking with not enough flavour, imo would be better with seared beef), everything else is amazing. Highly recommend the torched salmon sushi and their spicy salmon sushi burrito or bowl. 

The one thing that surprised me was how much I enjoyed their sushi bowls. I haven't really caught on to the current poke bowl craze (I just find the texture to be too mushy, and eventually get sick of eating the same taste and texture about halfway through), the sushi bowls are somewhat different, they include a wider variety of ingredients and textures in their bowls so that you're almost tasting and feeling different things in your mouth with each bite. If you find yourself not really liking poke bowls, I would still give their sushi bowls a try.

Their portions are also HUGE and prices are actually quite cheap. I thought they gave me the wrong order when they presented me with a half-portion of the sushi burrito, but I realized that the half-portion just looks like a full portion. They are massive. I also have no idea what kind of a monster can finish the full sized portion of their bowls, but you can always save some for later. You're essentially paying around $15 for the full bowl for what could be two meals.

Even though the place seems simple from the outside, a lot of care is put into the creation of each dish from not only the taste but also from a visual perspective. The service is also very friendly, and so far quick as there hasn't been a lot of customers when I was there. I highly recommend anyone to try it out before everyone else starts to crowd this place. I'm a big fan, and I'm sure you will be too."}
{"text":"Ritual'd this today and thought it was just okay. The taste of the food itself is a solid 3.5 

Everything else was sort of lacking. Lady at the front wasn't ready/aware of my order (which was odd) and had to rush in preparing my doshi. They didn't provide any cutlery/napkins/soy sauce and the donut itself looked haphazardly put together... which was unfortunate. :( 

In spite of all the kerfuffle, the food was alright. With each doshi at $9 a pop I would go here once for the gram  (if you're into that stuff) and then probably never again."}
{"text":"Fine spot for a quick bite to eat, but quite crowded and they don't seem very well set up for dine-in. Seared square sushi was tasty, no sake / beer menu, soy sauce / wasabi are in plastic packets, the place seats maybe 8 in total. Might go back if it was low traffic and I was curious about the rest of the menu, but overall there are other sushi bars around the area that I'll try first."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and polite, place is clean. I've heard great things about their Doshi but this review is only for their Unagi bowl. Ordered Ritual so I don't have to wait over lunch hour. 

Good that they have 1/2 portions vs full portion. The bowl itself is along the lines of the expensive healthy takeouts in that area. Great that I have the option to have white or brown rice. I opted for the brown. Just that the brown sushi rice had too much vinegar that goes well with raw salmon and tuna that's on their menu. It doesn't go well with the unagi that needs a plain rice. Over all it was too sweet for me with the pickled ginger, wakame/seaweed, and the unagi sauce. Eel is exactly the quality you pay for (don't expect much). 

I'll probably go back and try the Doshi. No more unagi bowl for me."}
{"text":"Basically, instagram worthy but over hyped. I had their blowtorch suchi, doshi (donut sushi), and their signature sushi 8 pieces.

The cashiers there are very kind and friendly, the interior's kind of small but the walls and the decors are all very cute. The doshi is definitely worth trying, the deep friend rice with cheese was actually good.

However I had a pretty big problem with the thickness of the fish. Seriously, even though there're like some picked vegetable or another layer of fish in the middle of the pretty huge block of rice, it was till overpriced for the piece of fish on top that has the same thickness as the hard cover of my textbook, I might have exaggerated a little, but you should go see some side view photos of the sushi. Don't get baited by the flat lay photos if you're a fan of good value.

Still, I did not regret trying it for once, the squared sushi really are cute."}
{"text":"The store was cute with minimalistic decor and the staff was friendly, but the food was not great and the seating arrangements were not practical. Not sure if it was one of their off days but the fish used in our order was definitely not fresh. Ordered combo 2 and it came with a sushi burrito, kale salad and three square nigiri style sushi. There were also barely any fish on the square sushi as it was cut into thin pieces. The square sushis did not taste good. The kale salad had no dressing... would've been best if they put balsamic vinegar on the salad at the least. The sushi burrito tasted alright but it was really bland even with soy sauce on the burrito. In terms of seating arrangements, one counter was too low and the stools were way too high for the counter. I wonder if there was mishaps in constructing these counters for the restaurant. 

Honestly, the concept of the restaurant seems great but due to the fact that the fish was not fresh and there were unreasonable portions of fish, this was definitely a deal breaker for me. Also, my friend and I fell really ill after eating at Square Fish. Something to keep mindful of."}
{"text":"After seeing their Instagram & yelp profiles we decided to check this place out to try the \"sushi bagel\" that is their current main photo on yelp and also appears many times on their Instagram page. Very disappointed as we came all the way downtown, went in and asked about it since we didn't see it on their PAPER regular printed 1 menu available in the store that they only serve poke bowls & sushi rolls... lol. Please don't advertise something if you guys do not have it available any more. Their menu have changed apparently and the only thing on the menu is poke bowls & sushi rolls. #wastemytime2018"}
{"text":"Gave it a try for the first time today because of the great looking poke bowls they have! They have a variety of poke bowls. My sister and I got the scallop and tuna poke bowls. We got the half size bowls; which is plenty and pretty filling. The prices are $8-9, which is very reasonable because the half sizes are actually pretty big in my opinion. The employees are very friendly and nice :) The only con is that there are very few seats and they are high stools and tables with very minimal space; there are only a total of 6 stools in there . Other than that, it was a great experience. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great quality food at a great value. I suggest to only takeout as the place is tiny. The only bad thing about this place is the rolls fall apart easily."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a couple of friends - it's really small so I would suggest take out or just going with one friend as it's hard to find more than 2 seats. To be honest we came here because of the presentation, super cute! Both food and service are good - definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"A very small, almost a hole-in-the-wall kind of place with about 4-5 seating near the entrance window where you can enjoy people-watching if you decide to dine-in.

Service: very friendly and good service, the cashier always greets you with a smile and \"thank you\" when you come in and leave (I always see the same girl when I go there)

Food: A pretty decent selection on their menu. They are known for their Instagram-able Donut Sushi (Doshi) and square shaped sushi, BUT I've only tried and always had their sushi burrito or bowl. Food comes pretty fast, and pretty decent and cheaper than most trendy sushi places I know.

Note: They have a loyalty program card where you can get 1 FREE item after every 12 IN-STORE PURCHASE ONLY"}
{"text":"Love the food. I tried the sushi doshi loved it and the torched salmon which was amazing. The place is really tiny but we were able to get a seat by the window."}
{"text":"Fresh, fun, and great concept. The service and staff are great and extremely friendly and the food is DELICIOUS. The fish is extremely fresh and the sushi is always tasty. The area is quite small, so it's hard to eat there and probably best to take out. It seats maybe 8-10 people. I will definitely come back and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I put off coming to Square Fish for a long time even though friends have been raving about this place to me for months. I finally gave in and decided to give this place a try. All I can say is, I can't believe I waited this long.

The salmon squares and salmon doshi were delicious! Packed with flavour and melts right in your mouth. The doshi does get a little messy, but don't let it deter you from trying it. It's amazing and I'm not even a sushi fan. The ingredients are always fresh and the service is very friendly.

I also tried their unagi bowl and it's not AS good as their squares or doshi. While it's good too, but not any different from a healthy bowl like someone else had mentioned. I only got two big pieces (equivalent of 4 standard pieces of eel that I get from unagi in other restaurants). Not really worth it.

The portions of their food are huge! And attractively priced too.

The restaurant is small, can only sit 6-8 people, so more of a takeout place during rush hour. But it's very clean. And no washrooms."}
{"text":"This was the most glorious little package I have ever ordered to go. The salmon doshi was much more than I expected it to be (although it cost $11 CAD). It had an appropriate amount of sashimi with lots of saucy flavors and tobiko (fish egg) on top of a deep-fried rice patty. Everything was incredibly fresh and tasty, even after I saved half of it until a few hours later. Service was very kind, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My first time having a sushi donut and it was amazing!!! It was messy but I enjoyed every second of it! The only con is that it is a little pricey. $10+ for a sushi donut. It could've used more fish. Regardless, would definitely return."}
{"text":"Alwys in the area looking for food. Stumbled upon this place with a cute clean design and decided to give it a try. Its a small place and theres only stools. But its comfortable enough. I came pretty late so it was fine, if it gets busy it might be crowded. 

They have a food display so if youre ever indecisive like me or dont know what you want to order, theyre really helpful and theyll show you :p Got two combos. The salmon doshi with salad and the tuna doshi with taro chips. They were both really good. Love the presentation of it. Creative idea!"}
{"text":"delicious! i got a poki bowl (half size) of the spicy tuna and salmon and it was so tasty and big! everything tasted fresh and the flavours really compliment each other. the half size bowl costs $11.5 with tax and it's definitely filling."}
{"text":"Got the salmon poke bowl and the dynamite shrimp bowl on just eats.

 The bowls come with lots of fresh ingredients ( edamame corn mango seaweed salad cream salad and avocado) . I got both with the kale salad which had a sweet citrus dressing that was awesome and very light. The large dynamite came with about 5 pieces of tempura shrimp and I'd get it again the salmon however tasted a bit off actually.. Not sure if it was the marinade that I didn't like.

Portions were fair and this is definitely one of the cheaper bowls in the city 9-10$ for small and 14 for large. They did change the containers so I think they are a bit smaller than what they use to be.

Would get again especially on a hot summer day!!"}
{"text":"Ate here when we were in the area shopping for groceries. It's a small joint next to Burger's Priest on Queen Street, near Spadina. Nothing too special about their sushi, except that it's all square shaped. I would go back but wouldn't be too rushed. There is a special, where if you spend over $15, you get a miso soup. Other than that, I would stick to my favourites like WOW Sushi. Bottom line, convenient in the area, unique experience, and clean venue for a quick casual lunch."}
{"text":"They changed the menu and now appear to be only a poke place.  I asked if I could create my own bowl and was told yes but then he created my bowl anyway and there is way too much stuff in it.  I got the spicy salmon but the kale gets in the way, there was a lot of ginger, and then random things like beans that just don't make sense.  Also not a lot of salmon for the price: 

Loved when it was square sushi but they don't really cut it for me as a poke place.  Very sad for the change."}
{"text":"The store was empty and I waited maybe 5 minutes for someone to come out from the back and greet me/take my order.

Ordered the square torched salmon sushi. Was expecting it to be fresh and torched on the spot but the cashier pulled an already made set of sushi from the fridge next to the cash register. I was not expecting the sushi to be premade nor do I know how long it was just sitting there in the fridge. I've never ever been to a sushi restaurant that just pulled premade food RIGHT in front of a customer and I dont know why my sushi wasnt made fresh, especially for the price I paid. 

Taste wise the fish was salty. Rice was chewey/hard, almost like supermarket sushi. Very dissappointed. Bad service bad food.  Would not recommend Squarefish."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place 3-4 times via Foodora and I plan to order from them 700 more times.

I usually order some sort of square sushi, a donut thinger and then a deconstructed sushi thinger I DON'T KNOW I JUST SHOVEL IT ALL IN MY MOUTH WHILE HOLLERING 

Last time I ordered, I had ordered the square sushi with beets and a girl called and very politely told me that they were out of beets, and I said 'that's cool I'll take more cucumber ones'.

/csb

I just told my friend about this place and now she's very excited and planning on gorging there sometime next week."}
