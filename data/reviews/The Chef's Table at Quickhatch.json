{"text":"We are in love with Quickhatch... the food, Chef  David and Courtney.  We have deemed it our new place as in we want to go all the time and take our friends and family.  We first tried it during Restaurant Week and returned for a Valentine's Day dinner. This place is a must try. Food quality and combinations are are over the top and so very adventurous.Tell me the last time you had heirloom popcorn on your soup? If the answer is never, you need to. All the ingredients have a story which makes it a local food tour.  It is the kind of place you kick back, take your time and enjoy food! We are looking forward to treating ourselves to many more meals at Quickhatch with Chef David."}
{"text":"Phenomenal dinner last night. The chef really understands food and has such a fresh take on local ingredients. They take farm to table very seriously. The chef even grows microgreens right there in the restaurant. It was such an interesting meal for restaurant week. I couldn't believe it was 6 courses plus an amuse bouche and a complimentary cocktail for such a small price. The portion sizes were perfect. Really imaginative use of ingredients. My favorite course might have been the purple carrot cake with goat cheese, ground cherries, candied walnuts, and dandelion jelly. The beef cheek with wheat berry risotto and celery root puree was also crazy good. Really everything was good. Even the braised leek heart with popcorn was surprisingly delicious.

We also came here for a 7 fishes dinner around the holidays and that was outstanding as well. This is a rising star in the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Get in there while you can still get a reservation. We can't wait to go back for burger night and BBQ dinners. It's also a coffee shop, but we haven't tried that part yet, but we certainly will."}
{"text":"it was restaurant week. we read over the menu & loved it. i called & left a message for a reservation. No one returned my call by the next afternoon, so i called again. i spoke with a man that said he was so sorry, but they had had a gas leak & ended up closed for a few days. we made reservations for tues., the 23rd at 6pm. he had my name  & #.
we live in the s. hills, they're in etna. tom left work early so he could come home & shower. we left & fought through rush hour traffic in 2 directions. we pulled up across the street from it, trying to find it. finally, we saw it, dark! dark, dark, dark!!! my hubby went to the door. there was a note saying, sorry, we're closed still from a gas leak & frozen pipes! WHAT??? we just drove all the way over here, for nothing?! they didn't even have the decency to call us! 
NOT a good thing at all! i didn't want to give them any stars, but i had to, so they just get 1."}
{"text":"Our group of eight had an outstanding multi-course menu this past Saturday night at Quickhatch in Etna. We were seated at a large table in a paneled back room that was a bit drafty on a cold night but they surrounded us with space heaters. Chef David Bulman was front-and-center to explain each course along with details on where and from whom he sourced the hyper-local products. Each course was unique with some uncommon combinations coming together beautifully. Hickory nuts with tartare of local beef, sunchokes three different ways, \"tea\" of flowers and ramps over local trout and mushrooms. Our group, who have eaten at many of the top restaurants in the world, was impressed with the chef's handing of the region's high-quality products. Set menu came out to about $120 per person including tax and 20% tip. You bring your own wine (yay) and no corkage fee (double-yay)! Not inexpensive but considering the quality and care that went into this 3+ hour experience, it was worth the price and the visit to Etna."}
{"text":"Lovely dining room hidden in the back of a coffee shop. We had a 6 course tasting menu designed + prepared by chef David Bulman. 

Just like a good superhero, each course came with a great origin story. Almost every ingredient was sourced from western Pennsylvania (with the only outlier coming from western New York).

This was a really special dining experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
