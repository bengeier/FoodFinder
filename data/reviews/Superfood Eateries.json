{"text":"Great food and juices.  Kale chips are awesome as well as their homemade \"granola\" which is addicting.  Freshly made vegan meals are very good and the juices I have tasted are all excellent."}
{"text":"Ate here today 17.1.2014 and there is no question the food is top notch and they understand what they are doing when it comes to super foods aka (Thrive Diet) however their items are hopelessly overpriced for the amount you are getting. I payed $46.75 for a large and small salad, 4 hemp balls and a drink..."}
{"text":"In town for business and wanted to try something healthy and local. Superfood did not disappoint. I had the tacos with the salad and a reboot detox juice. Very delicious and fresh. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing smoothie (I had the 'All-Star' - highly recommended), and super friendly service.  I'm only in town for 5 days for TIFF, but will definitely be coming in every morning to kick start my day!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and very knowledgable!  We had the vegan tacos and pizza .   Muy bien!  Pizza had a little spice so it would be great if you love spice!   If you're in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time today. Delicious vegan pad thai bowl and friendly, welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"The staff is excellent and very knowledgeable.  I owner takes pain staking effort to maintain food quality. It is the ultimate in Raw Vegan..  Everything I have tried has been amazing. The price is on par with other vegan places and is worth every penny. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had a very nice time during my first visit to Superfood Eateries.  The restaurant was super clean, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the food was fresh and tasty.   There are three things holding me back from giving a 5-star review. First, although the food is very good, it isn't particularly creative or unique. (It's basically run-of-the-mill food for a raw/vegan restaurant, but done quite well.) Second, the seating is not great. (It's really not designed for eating in, and the available seating is pretty awkward.) Third, the prices are acceptable but higher than would be ideal for the location and menu.  These are small complaints. I really liked Superfood Eateries, and I'll definitely be bringing friends and family back soon!"}
{"text":"I too just stumbled upon this place today while out doing some Christmas shopping in the area.  It is hard to find good raw, vegan, gluten free options for lunch.  This place is really good and though its not particularly close or convenient to my work I will be back frequently.  Super clean, very fresh, nice people working there.  They offered me a sample of something and it was so delicious I was sold - bought the lunch size version - cucumber roles filled with something healthy and delicious and a nice fresh salad.  Prices aren't bad at all and are to be expected - this place is quality - you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, it's a small eatery but the space is bright! The staff is very knowledgable and friendly. They have such a selection that you could possibly get overwhelemed or just want to try everything. They are pricy but the fact that everything is raw, natural and just plain delicious is a major draw. I would recommend anybody who likes to try raw foods to come and stop by. They also have a rewrds program so there is another reason to come back!"}
{"text":"I really like the staff here. They are helpful, knowlegable and passionate about what they are doing. I like that they have a grab-and-go concept because it's very quick and easy to get lunch and bring it back to my office. The coconut water here is amazing. It tastes like an actual young coconut was just opened. It's worth the price for sure as are the dishes. The quality of the food is very high."}
{"text":"Really yummy food! I got a small pad thai bowl and a Hardcore juice. A little pricey for the amount of food or drink that you get- but worth it! It's not too pricey considering that the juice and smoothies are made of organic, cold-pressed super food ingredients. Even though I'm sure you could get a cheaper salad elsewhere- you probably can't get much cheaper with their awesome ingredients and eco-friendly packaging.   It's not much of a \"dine in\" place- although there are tables where you can sit down and eat. It seems like most of the stuff available is pre-made (probably made that day) and then packaged up. Great for take away!  They have a good variety of healthy salads and bottles juices and smoothies, all within a decent price range ($7 for a 250ml and $10 for 500ml.)  Great way to quickly get some really good, fresh, organic food!"}
{"text":"I tried the liquid cleanse over two days (they typically recommend 3 or more) but I simply couldn't do it due to work. The juices they provided were delicious and obviously  healthy ;). I definitely felt the affects as they had described. Will definitely give it another go before the end of the year!"}
{"text":"Just too expensive to consider going back. I'm sure the ingredients are quality and it tastes fine but I didn't love the experience that much. Everyone was nice but the smoothies are pre-made and bottled. The bottles are returnable but there is no incentive to return vs. throw out. A discount would definitely help. But also it's not really called out by the staff or on the bottle as an option. Just didn't feel like I was getting the value for my money."}
{"text":"Tacos were incredible. Kale salad was outstanding. 4 stars only because the $5 energy bar with coconut tasted really bad."}
{"text":"I tried Superfood for my first time today and I only wish I would have discovered it sooner! I bought the Reboot 500ml gentle detox juice and it was the perfect balance of flavours with a beautiful taste of freshness in every gulp. Luciano was very welcoming and informative to talk to about all of the products! I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try more of Superfood's yummy goodness!!"}
{"text":"I tried the \"protein pizza,\" which was composed of a buckwheat crust, sundried tomatoes, cashew-based cheese, and some other assorted vegetables.  Although the portion seemed small, I was amazed how such a small portion can make me full even after an intense workout.  The food tasted really great.   I also tried their freshly pressed juices, though pricey, were very tasty.  The two co-owners seemed genuinely passionate about the food that they sell, which is organic, vegan, and raw.    I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything is natural and the people who work there are knowledgable and friendly.  I got a pad Thai bowl and a bottle of almond milk. It was more like a salad than pad Thai but it was still delicious. (Wish they had included more carrot and zucchini \"noodles\" instead of the chopped cabbage at the bottom, though, and peanuts instead of cashews would be scrummy.) The almond milk was definitely quality. Quite pricey, especially if you get a juice (they run about $9 and there's a good selection of yummy sounding ones) with meals going for about $12. Still everything was very satisfying and I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm becoming addicted to this place! I stopped in a few weeks ago while running some sunday errands-- it's around the corner from my house and I'd never checked it out.  I've been gluten and dairy free for 2 months now, and while I love it, I'd really been starting to get bored. I needed something new!  The first thing I bought was the Hot Date-- the most DELICIOUS , filling, and guilt free vegan parfait. Highly recommended. This week i headed back and got the Up In Smoke dinner-- 2 tacos and a salad. I can't tell you how quickly I ate them!! So good and honestly the closest I've had to real tacos since I started this diet. Dare I say, almost as good (if not better than) the real thing. I probably over ate and could've got away with eating just one taco because they're quite big, but at least I knew I had put good things in my body.   I also want to mention how amazing the staff is. The owner is super friendly and always remembers my face, and it's refreshing that he truly loves what he does. I'll be back here a bunch.. Even though my wallet isn't too thrilled im sure (not over priced but we all know prepared food like this doesn't come cheap!)."}
{"text":"We are shooting a television show in the area and crew is always looking for healthy alternatives to processed craft truck options - stumbled into this brightly lit spot where the staff were helpful and friendly and the juice options were exquisite! These guys are doing it right! Picked the \"Coming Attraction\" cuz duh, we're film people - intense and delicious! Let the cameras roll!!"}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by this store.  It's premade food in an open air fridge.  Takes away the experience of a restaurant.  The pizza was ok.  The drink was very light.  Too expensive"}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews here about this place I decided to give it a try for lunch. Wasn't sure what it would be like and discovered it's more of a ready made meals, take out place, although they have a few seats if you want to stay. There were a few people behind the counter making some delicious looking food and who I presume was an owner greeted me really nicely. He explained everything to me and then I picked out the Raw Vegan Pad Thai to take back to work with me. He was a super nice, genuine guy who seemed very passionate about what they're doing.  As for the food, wow! Absolutely delicious! Full of flavour and the pad thai sauce they made is unreal. Wish I had more to take home with me. I just finished eating my meal and feel nourished and energized. Very happy that places like this are opening to provide nutritious, healthy food on the go. I would say it was just a tiny bit expensive at $12 for a lunch meal but considering how tasty and nutrient dense it was, absolutely worth it. Everything they make is vegan and from what I could see, most of it was raw as well.  Highly recommended and I will be back!"}
{"text":"super friendly, excellent food, creative and really well thought-out products. guaranteed EVERYTHING you see here was made by hand and took hours to do. i spent sometime with the staff asking about their processes and was amazed attheir attention to detail.  these guys know whats up and where the future of food is! might be expensive but believe me this kinda cuisine is cheaper than a trip to the hospital. just do it!"}
{"text":"Was just getting off a cleanse, and feeling healthy AF, so I decided to continue the body purifying at Superfood. I found this place on yelp, read a couple of reviews, and made my way over.  The staff were super helpful in explaining each takeaway option and offering suggestions about what I might like best. The food is designed to be super clean, vegan, and nutrient-rich. It was exactly what my body needed. I got the fruit and cashew cream parfait, some natural granola, and a green smoothie. So delicious and filling! While it's pricey, I think it's worth it for the quality. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Based solely on the Pizza, this place is delicious. For less than $15 the pizza was delicious and filling, I would definitely go there for that again."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying I am a health food fanatic. I love health food and live in Hawaii (the spot for amazing health food). I was stoked to find a health food place while visiting Toronto and wanted to love it, but I believe they had a few issues.  The first was the size of the drink for the money. $10 for 500ml is allot of doe.  Many places offer more for less. And the bottles were not full.  That's a big issue for me.  The second issue was that there were no fresh made juices or smoothes, and when you bottle a juice or smoothie product, many of the antioxidants and nutrients don't survive, and your left with high glicemic sugar water. (It tastes great I must say). The salad that we got was great though, flavors were nice and it tasted great. The portion was small though :( The third product I bought was the sweet potato chips. They were pretty bad. I understand that a dehydrated product can't be like a fried chip, but these things were REALLY lacking.  I would never sell them.   This place has a lot of potential.  (To the owner) This is what I would do.  Un-whiteify the place Nd add comfortable seating. My first thought was hospital.  Warm and welcoming appeals to me.  Start a fresh smoothie and juice bar.  This will keep people hanging out in the place, and possibly lead to further purchases.  START A BOTTLE REDEMPTION PROGRAM.  There is no initiative  for people to bring back the bottles.  This would draw people back into the business and lead to more money! Also, you can reuse the bottles and save on costs.  Aloha and wish the business the best. Jack"}
{"text":"A few weeks back I was looking for something fresh & healthy (as I felt a cold coming on!) and stumbled upon this place on Yelp. I typically make my own lunch, so I was feeling particularly spendy on this day and opted for a sandwich ($13?) + grabbed a smoothie ($10). The prices were a little bit steep for the quantity compared to my usual spots west of dt, but I know making real food takes a lot of labour & I'm guessing their rent is high. So, this is a great place to grab a tasty (and very satiating!) meal occasionally when you're DT. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!   Whole organic super foods taste so much better!   This place is awesome for a quick and nutritious lunch!"}
{"text":"Man, I needed a hit of LA today. This place has captured the soul of all those uber hip California eateries frequented by hoards of health- and body-obsessed beach babes (male and female) who eat clean to burn brighter than everyone else. And the raw plant thing is totally working for them. (As it will you, and did for me, who came in feeling ravaged from a champagne gala last night and left feeling like a powerhouse.)  This food is pure energy, packed with flavor and nutrition, and will make you look and feel amazing. Sure it's pricy, but anyone who's prepared a juice or wrap like this knows  just how much expensive organic produce, time, equipment and labour it takes to produce something with this much vita-punch.  Note they only serve grab and go food and drinks - though there are cute little tables - but based on the five items we sampled today, you won't go wrong with anything here. All the flavors were incredible. Dare I say even better than some similar places in LA? Pretty incredible consider those dudes have much better access to fresh organic produce. For a spot this far North, this place is truly a godsend."}
{"text":"Wow I never imagined.raw food would taste this good! Only one star down bc of the high prices but taste was amazing! This is more of a splurge takeout place for us"}
{"text":"This is the healthiest place to eat in Toronto. They make everything fresh that day and it's ready for you to pick up and eat.   I got a few things because it all looked so good!   Vegan tacos -- just do it. They are amazing.  Vegan pizza -- nice as well, but would recommend the tacos if you're just getting one thing.  Vegan brownie - how can you not?!   Left with a couple smoothies and juices because I have a feeling I'll be a little nostalgic in a few hours after eating so well."}
{"text":"Simply WOW!! One of the very few places in Toronto where you can actually feel and taste the freshness in the food and smoothies. If you're looking to treat your body to what it really deserves, no need to look anywhere else. Would give it more stars if I could."}
{"text":"I was looking for vegan options in the downtown core and ended up here. Turned out great, as I got the two tacos with salad ($16 I think) or dinner and it was super filling. Very tasty too! My only comment is that the taco 'shell' was a bit soggy since the food is grab and go."}
{"text":"Despite having been opened in April of 2013, I just came across Superfoods last week and I'm really glad I decided to venture in for a healthy lunch. It isn't the best spot for a sit down lunch despite having a table or 2 cramped up at the front, you're greeted by the counter as you enter, but your focus should be directed to their open refrigerator which is where all their food is. I admit I was a little let down that all they have is cold foods (but maybe there is a whole warm food menu that they kept hidden from me).   The top shelf of the fridge is full of smoothies, they all sounded really interesting with all sorts of healthy (random?) items. I opted for the \"hardcore\" I can't remember all it's ingredients but it definitely had a good amount of almond milk in it. At $6 for the smaller sized bottles it's a little pricey but it was very good. I'm not sure if I could justify spending $12 on a bigger bottle though.   I went for their pad thahi salad, they have a few different ones to choose from, I believe it was their Caesars salad that had some sort of dried onion/crouton-ish substance? which I was offered to try, it was a little too onion-y for my tastes. I was very pleased with my pad thai salad which came with a delicious peanut sauce, the whole thing was very fresh and crunchy, definitely mix it up before you dig in or else you will be left with nothing but cauliflower at the bottom.   So while I would like to see more items on their menu; namely ones that would keep me warm with the winter coming up, Superfood is definitely the healthiest lunch you could hope to grab in the area."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for work and found this place within walking distance. It was perfect. I wasn't going to get the Hot Date until I read the reviews here on Yelp, and I'm SO glad I did. It was amazing - a dairy-free parfait with fresh fruit and a coconut cream that made me want to lick the cup afterwards. The granola has coconut and other ingredients that gave the whole cup a flavorful tasty crunch.   I also grabbed the All-Star smoothie, with almond milk, coconut water, spinach, banana, mango and other tasty ingredients. It was top notch as well. It looks like a green juice but is definitely a smoothie. It smells like banana but that flavor isn't overpowering.   All in all, a 5-star breakfast, and I will be going back before my trip is over!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just... wow.   Not only are the juices amazing but their food is outstanding. I would give more stars if I could. Hot Date may be my new favourite thing in the world. It was beautifully fresh fruit with big chunks of kiwi and mango with a sprinkle of gogis layered with handmade granola bar pieces and the best cashew cream ever.   Loved the small little eating area, it was the PERFECT stop for a late breakfast and to plan our day. The owners are also lovely. I will be a return customer again and again!"}
{"text":"I found this place and came in. I ordered the baby spice and it was so good! All the menu is vegan, healthy and tasty! The owner is so kind and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"wow, wow, wow.  so i have to say i was incredibly surprided at how delicious the food was.  i got something that was like zuchini but rapped in dairy free ricotta and squash or somethibg like that...mygod it was savoury.  it was like pasta...lol with a side salad.  i recebtly went dairy and gluten free and well im so happy to come across this place.  the gentleman had great energybtoo very welcoming and great attitude.  extremely helpful."}
{"text":"Luciano is personable and the food is exceptional. I have been on the clean eating quick for awhile and the prices here match the food ingredients and flavours."}
{"text":"This is my favorite food joint in the area. Everything is handmade, vegan and raw. It's so delicious and you feel great after eating here. The thing that got me really hooked is their cold pressed juices. They use a Norwalk Juicer. The device is super expensive to purchase, but amazing if you can experience the juice that comes out of it. The full flavor and nutrients of the fruits and veggies come out. Super high quality and highly recommended if you want to feel amazing after your meal."}
{"text":"Had the tacos (their most popular item) - did not disappoint. Delicious, healthy stuff."}
{"text":"Got take-out from Superfood Eateries for the second time today and I'm sold.  I'm definitely going to try every single thing they have. I'm celiac and lactose intolerant but far from vegan and the food is satisfying and so delicious. Don't fool yourself and think it's going to taste like any \"regular\" taco, pizza or sandwich you've ever had, it's not, it's going to taste totally new but it might make you switch up your routine a little and toss some raw meals in the mix! Okay it isn't cheap, but it's worth it, the ingredients are expensive. When you order something, ask what's in it, and then think about how much all that stuff adds up to at the grocery store, honestly it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great bottled juice! I'll definitely stock up on their products for my trip next time I'm in Toronto! If you like supporting entrepreneurs, this place is a must. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn about this place because it's delicious, very fresh, and makes me feel healthier than I probably am. BUT it is also really quite expensive.   Out of the boxed lunches, I have only tried the \"Up in Smoke\" which is $16 before tax. It's delicious and very filling. I love everything about it except the wrap they use for the tacos. It gets this weird texture from getting soggy in the taco juices (everything is pre-made and boxed at this place).   I had a company paid-for lunch today so I decided to get a full meal (a drink $12, boxed lunch $16, dessert $9) and my bill came up to just a little over $40 after tax. $40 For one person's lunch!!   I don't want to rate any lower because they really are doing things well, the space is also great and the staff are super nice and helpful. I just can't justify spending that much on everyday lunch. I will be back the next time the company pays for lunch, though."}
{"text":"This is a small place where I believe they make everything fresh.  I had a juice and the Lucky Luciano - which is a pizza type thing (you get 2 \"slices\") for $13, which are tiny-ish.  I was good, but my meal was about $22.  I amnot sure the price = the meal.    There are a few seats/tables to sit, but it doesn't lend to a cozy, chat with your friends kinda place.  In fact, in trying to have a conversation, the staff was running the juicer or blender or something.  Whatever it was, it sounded like a jumbo jet landing and I couldn't hear anything my friend was saying.  Maybe better for a grab and go...but if I had an extra $20, I can think of a few other places where I would prefer to spend my money.  My just a grab and go for the juices."}
{"text":"Best raw dessert ever!! They have a variety of great desserts specially for vegans and gluten free eaters that are looking for a healthy treat.  There salads were amazing as well! Very tasty and very filling. Completely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Love  the salads -Sky Rocket and MVP are amazing. Also loved the tacos Up in Smoke. Really everything is so healthy and delicious. You can feel good about what you are eating. A new favourite lunch spot in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so incredible. Organic healthy nourishing energizing food. Smoothies and juices are delicious. I loved the Hardcore, also tried to detox green smoothie and beet juice. Awesome. The cheesecake was INCREDIBLE. How do they make it like that, all raw and healthy and vegan?! I will be returning tomorrow to buy another. Also loved the 2 parfaits (one with mixed fruit and one apple) and the energy bar- it literally tasted like a lemon croissant. This breakfast fueled me and my family up for a day of touring - this was our first time to Toronto - and I saved half the cheesecake as the PERFECT nighttime snack. So impressed with this place. Every dollar is worth it. Thanks a ton Yelp for helping me find Superfood eateries!!!"}
{"text":"What an incredible find. The only thing better than the delicious, freshly prepared, grab and go whole foods smoothies and juices is the unbelievably kind and helpful staff. They clearly have a love for what they do and want you to know they're not just there to sell you food, but to help improve the well being of every person that walks through the door with a personal connection. Love this place."}
{"text":"We went here for desserts and had the blueberry cheesecake as well as vegan pumpkin coconut cheesecake and they were by far the best Vegan desserts we've had. I would certainly go back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything I've tried here is delicious. Pizza is my fave. Staff is excellent. Every time I'm in Toronto, I need to hit Superfood!!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to my work and I always pop in for a quick pick me up whether its their \"Pad Thai\" salad, a brownie or a juice! I actually find this place to have way more value than other cold-pressed juice places. Love their pad thai salad and narcotics brownie. Have been coming here frequently and probably won't stop!"}
{"text":"A very good place to grab a quick one (drink or food). I had 'Up in Smoke' and found it to be delicious. The veggies and Tacos were fresh, the sauce just about right and complementing the salad well. However, I am docking off one star for I would have preferred to have the salad/taco prepared in my presence. The current arrangement of 'packaged item' would be ideal if you do a grab-n-go order. But, for someone who is prepared to wait, it would be nicer to have an option to take a freshly-prepared salad."}
{"text":"I loved the mango parfait I got from this place along with the berry smoothie.  It was quite fulfilling! If you're looking for a great quick heathy breakfast this place of perfect.  Trust me, you won't miss the pancakes or sandwiches. It's the perfect break if you're looking for something different and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The salads, tacos, juices. I'd eat there every day if it weren't so pricey! Why does eating healthy have to cost so much?"}
{"text":"Vegan and sooo delicious! Had the 'ricotta' roll ups with salad, very filling and delicious! They also have insanely delicious pure coconut water. I'll definitely be back to try everything else."}
{"text":"Délicieux!  Ouvert depuis avril 2013, je souhaite vivement que ce petit commerce connaisse le succès qu'il mérite!  Le \"fast\" food santé par excellence. Plus fin que Crudessence, (pour ceux qui connaissent à montréal), nous avons pris les cannelonis aux courgettes \"Leave  the gun, take the canoli\" et les tacos \"Up in smoke\" avec une purée d'avocats...  Un régal!  Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'équilibre des saveurs et bien entendu la fraicheur des aliments. Nous avons mangé sur place, ce qui est rigolo mais pas vraiment confo. 5 minuscules tables de chevet et des petits pouffes, tout en blanc. Design oui. Pratique, plus ou moins. J'avais l'impression d'être dans la cuisine de mes amis pendant qu'ils préparaient bruyamment un grand repas en écoutant de la musique fort rythmée.   Mais je cherche vraiment à trouver qqchose à critiquer:  je recommande fortement ce petit joyaux de bouffe crue sur le pouce!!"}
{"text":"Just stumbled across this restaurant and glad I did. The owner really cares about his ingredients and food he makes. I got the 'coming attraction' juice which was bottled that day. Very refreshing. I paired it with the raw vegan pad Thai which the owner gladly mixed together for me. It was very flavourful, guilt free, and super healthy. There are about 7 small stools to sit and enjoy the meal. I got to chat with the owner and his his journey in becoming a raw vegan. Although it is a bit pricy, the quality of ingredients makes it worthwhile. Look forward to trying more on the menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem of a place while wandering around the neighborhood and saw signs for live/raw juices and food. Intrigued, I went in and immediately was greeted by the owner and discovered everything here was raw, vegan and gluten-free.  Right up my alley!  Upon browsing the selection of pre-packaged (but all made on-premises) smoothies, salads, desserts, bowls, etc, I chose a Caesar salad and the All-Star Smoothie. The owner said that the All-Star smoothie was their best-selling one and I quickly found out why. Made up of spinach, almond milk, coconut water, banana, mango, medjool dates, hemp seeds and spirulina, I was afraid of the banana being too strong or it being too sweet, but it really wasn't! The banana was noticeable but not overpowering and it was the perfect balance of the fruits and vegetables. Delicious.   The salad was delicious, too, made up of vegan, raw, and gluten-free \"cheese\" (cashew-based I believe?), \"Caesar dressing\" (on the side) and \"croutons\" (I have no idea what this was made of but it was perfectly savory and itself a little cheese-y).   All exceptionally fresh, well thought-out combinations. A little on the expensive side but the quality of food is well worth the higher price tag.   They even encourage you to bring back the glass bottles the smoothies come in to be recycled."}
{"text":"I wanted to go in to try out super foods today but once I got there it was closed even thou Yelp said it was open. Super disappointing cuz I went out of my way to come in before work. Now I'm hungry and waiting for lunch time"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place once and had to tell the whole office how amazing it was via our internal forum and couldn't wait to go back! I did and loved it even more than the first time. Try the All-Star smoothie and the cheesecake thingy (obviously forgot what it's called). The pumpkin pie has very bold flavours so if you're used to the refined and artificial box crap, approach with caution. The people I met there were very kind too and hopefully they get used to seeing me every week"}
{"text":"I had a pumpkin pie slice. It was delicious! Really nice customer service too! Overall, a positive experience!"}
{"text":"Update: I tried their 3rd cake called \"Divine Compensation\", made with a cashew filling, almond crust, and topped with small blueberries. It was great, just wish it was thicker!   Out of all 3 cakes I've tried, my favourite is still the raspberry mousse cake (called Cosmic Mind). I'm hoping they come out with new flavours!!"}
