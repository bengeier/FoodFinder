{"text":"As soon as you walk in the door you are hit with a wonderful bbq joint smell, it's exactly what you want out of a place like this! Super friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. Food taste amazing as well and the prices are phenomenal.   Overall, this is  a must stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"New management and new menu. I enjoyed the former version of the restaurant (Ryno'sBBQ) but the new version is awesome. It's a weird BBQ/Mexican fusion that's unique and seriously confusing to my taste buds, which I believe to be a great thing. Anything but boring. The green chili brisket burrito was fantastic! I wasn't sure whether to use BBQ or there green salsa... So I alternated. So weird but awesome! Smoked chicken quesadilla was great too.  For the traditional folks, the pulled pork was very similar to the original."}
{"text":"This place was very fast and very friendly. I love the spicy BBQ sauce and I found out they have ever one even hotter I can't wait to try. Taco Tuesday is a great deal!! My hubby got the tacos and they were very yummy. I got the chicken and it had so much flavor it was almost a shame to put the sauce on it! I got the chicken and macaroni and cheese for my daughter (she is seven) she loved the Alfredo Mac so much she stole mine as well! I can't wait until next Thursday we are picking up wings! They are rotisserie wings with a dry rub and the flavor is amazing!! The prices are so good I can take all my kids (family of seven lol) and not break the bank (soooo much better than fast food chains lol)! It's our new favorite go to! Plus I love supporting small local family owned places and you can feel the warmth when you walk through the door!"}
{"text":"I give you fair warning before I even get into it: Pepe's BBQ is inedible. We were warned as soon as we walked in that they had no pork. If you only have chicken, brisket and pork, that's 1/3 of your menu gone. We worked around it and ordered the brisket and 2 sides, including a tea. I loves me some good ole BBQ restaurant sweet tea. As a matter of fact, we found this dump with the thirst that could only be quenched by this amazing beverage. We got a generic tea dispenser sitting in the corner that had what they claimed was tea, but tasted like Chinese river water (that's bad). No amount of sugar could mask the flavor. After waiting 20-25 minutes for our food, we were told the macaroni and cheese wouldn't be done for about another 30 minutes. Great. I looked back over the menu, a piece of paper taped to the counter, and said I'd take the baked beans... wait... REFRIED BEANS? Yup, that was the bean selection. In a BBQ joint. That got refunded. When the food came out it got even worse. The fries were like already soggy fries that had been microwaved. Or they'd just been soaked in that same Chinese river for 3 days or so. I mean how can you screw up French fries? They managed. The brisket tasted like it had been sitting in olive oil until it was ordered. It was horrible. When I told the guy up front he seemed shocked that someone was telling him the food was bad. I was surprised at how surprised he was. We were refunded our meal (which was EXPENSIVE by the way) and went to get something to eat. One single meat meal and a drink (my girlfriend had water) was $21. I don't believe I'll ever find a BBQ place this bad I my life."}
{"text":"Gone downhill since new management.  Ordered brisket, pork and chicken.  Brisket and pork tasted like they were cooked in a crockpot with unflavored water.  No fat or seasoning could be seen or tasted.  The chicken was saved by the fact they left the skin on and it had some seasoning.  If not for the spicy BBQ sauce the meal would have been inedible.  Also no ice in the fountain machine.  Out of  sweet AND spicy beans and ribs.  The one star rating can be attributed to the BBQ sauce at the table and coke zero on the fountain machine.  I'd be shocked if this place is here in 6 months."}
{"text":"Pepe's is the new name for Ryno's BBQ. From what I can tell it's the same employees and excellent menu, looks like they may be doing some redecorating though which isn't a bad idea. I've been going to Ryno's for years and think they are some of the best BBQ in AZ, especially for their prices. If you like hot be sure to ask for the \"XXX\" hot sauce they keep in the back.. Very spicey and perfect flavor but you can still taste the smoke. I hope this place sticks around for awhile and maybe will drive in some more business. The food here is too darn good! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We've both eaten inside the restaurant and have had their food catered for a family party.  The food was delicious and full of flavor.  The sides were tasty, especially the cream corn.  I liked the brisket the most, it was amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed Ryno's BBQ and were slightly disappointed when we returned to find it under new management. Fortunately this place is awesome!! The Mexican flavor infused with the traditional BBQ is fantastic! On our first visit we tried the BBQ Chicken quesadilla, green chili brisket burrito, and the traditional pulled pork with Cajun fries. Everything was excellent but when I bit into that burrito I saw unicorns! Holy smokes it was amazing! Their green sauce will change your life and if you like spicy request the xxx BBQ sauce kept behind the counter. It has a slow roasted, sneak up and punch you in the face heat. If you're in this neck of the woods you have to stop in and enjoy great customer service and delicious food."}
