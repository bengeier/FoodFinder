{"text":"After searching for a place for brunch, we came across this restaurant on our walk.  We had the les folies which was everything imaginable on a plate including 2 eggs, crepes, potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit and beans.  Also had the banana and chocolate crepes that came with fruit, potatoes.  We really enjoyed the potatoes.  Cute place to grab a bite, nothing extraordinary, but worth checking out if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Beautiful if it's not cold and you can get a table on the patio. Good food. Good drinks. Ok service. 

It gets a bit overwhelming inside. Tiny tables packed into a small area. 

Still a cool plAce."}
{"text":"A great brunch spot, especially if you're not a fan of the line at L'Avenue.

Came for Sunday brunch at 11:30, only about 10 minutes until we had a prime spot on the patio (there was space inside). Great service in both official languages despite a mostly packed house, and our food arrived in less than 15 minutes. 

The food was great - not much to say, it's a delicious and reasonably priced brunch. Waitress came by multiple times to refill water, coffee, etc.

The other reviews, if you read them, seem to be written by difficult people who did everything to ask for bad service. Les Folies is a great spot, ignore the others - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Situé en plein cur du Plateau et à deux pas du métro Mont-Royal, le restaurant Les Folies est un petit endroit peu connu de beaucoup de gens. Toutefois, il constitue une merveilleuse découverte, et ce peu importe la situation. L'endroit possède une petite terrasse assez agréable lors des après-midi de printemps ou encore lors des chaudes soirées d'août. 

La décoration intérieure est soignée, avec un style rétro : des murs et des tables aux coins arrondis et des banquettes blanches et bleu poudre. Un DJ les soirs de week-end offre une ambiance cool, avec de la musique électronique en background. 

Pour ce qui est de la bouffe, il y en a pour tous les goûts. En effet, le menu offre des burgers, des pâtes, des salades, des entrées sympathiques et même quelques choix pour les végétariens, le tout à un prix abordable. Sans nécessairement réinventer la roue, on sent que la carte a été travaillée et les plats sont meilleurs que ce à quoi on s'attendrait. Les Folies sert même des brunchs jusqu'à assez tard dans la journée. Par contre, je ne les ai pas goûtés donc je ne peux pas affirmer qu'ils soient excellents. Toutefois, si je me fie à la qualité des plats principaux, le résultat devrait être assez satisfaisant. 

Les Folies possède aussi une carte de drinks très diversifiée. On est loin du simple mojito avec un petit arôme de menthe artificiel; le mojito aux Folies existe en plusieurs déclinaisons, comme par exemple avec des framboises. Il y en a vraiment pour tous les goûts. 
 De plus, on se sent bien quand on franchit la porte du restaurant, et ce malgré le fait qu'il soit situé sur le Plateau. La clientèle ne se soumet pas aux stéréotypes qu'on pourrait avoir sur le Plateau Mont-Royal. On y retrouve des gens de tous âges; des universitaires, des couples ou encore des jeunes - et même des plus vieux - parents avec leurs enfants. 

Bref, si vous cherchez un endroit aux allures décontracts avec des plats sans prétention mais savoureux, je suis sûre que Les Folies saura vous plaire."}
{"text":"J'ai passé un bon moment.
Le repas était correct et jai aime l'ambiance. 
Il y a une terrasse bien sympa l'été :)"}
{"text":"This place was cozy with great service. We both had the burgers which came with a generous amount of delicious fries and fresh salad. The burgers were good but could have used a little more seasoning and a little less bun. Also it was an extra $1 or so for pickles..... I didn't understand that. Drinks were great and the prices were reasonable. Overall great value and pleasant atmosphere. Can't wait to go in the summer and enjoy a pint on the terasse."}
{"text":"I came solo on a Friday night for a quick bite to eat. It's so close to the Mont Royal Metro that it's almost right outside of the station door. The vibe is cool, chill and relaxed but funky. I had the Cancun wrap and it was cheesy and crunchy. The staff are friendly and the food came hot and fast. I would definitely come here to try something else delicious from their menu. They have a selection of poutines that sound delish! A cool spot to have a long Friday dinner with friends because it isn't too packed but wasn't dead. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting over 45 minutes and and still haven't received my food.  Only when we asked for when our food would arrive did the waitress tell us about how \"busy\" they were. The couple next to us was also complaining about the wait and one of their orders was completely wrong. Do not come here unless you have the patience of an angel."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and up to what you would expect French food would be! I orders crepe special which came with 2eggs ( I chose Benedict eggs which came perfect!!!) crepe with strawberry and ham stuff and cheese with fruit in stick, bread and ham for only 12. Bucks! Love love! Nice find! I wanted to try l'avenue, too but there were 15 people waiting. I'm glad I discover this place!!"}
{"text":"My sisters were visiting out of town and we wanted to go to L'avenue down the street but the line up was too long, so we went here. We waited 50min to get our order and 20min to get coffee. The bénédictines were overcooked but because we already waited so long, we didn't bother to complain (was pretty hangry by then). The confit de canard was also dry....

I would say the food is below average but the decor and terrasse is pretty nice. Montreal is such a food city, I think you can find better elsewhere easily."}
{"text":"Went to Les Folies when the waiting line at L'Avenue was too long. There were not many choices on the menu which was a bit disappointing. But the food was quite good and the service was amazing. Would definitely come here again if we can't get into L'Avenue the next time"}
{"text":"I got there at 7PM, I asked for a beer and just before I ordered something to eat they told me it was mandatory to buy something because the alcohol law and whathever. I just left the place, looks like the service is not customer oriented after all. When you seat down and get confortable you find what the catch is and leave totally disappointed. will definitely NOT come back"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great for how busy it was. The Benny was decent. Great little place to stop in."}
{"text":"Une des places à déjeuners les plus surévaluées de Montréal. La bouffe y est OK, mais rien de spécial (des ufs, des crèpes, etc.). Mais le service est lamentable. J'y suis allé avec un ami qui s'est lassé après avoir attendu un verre d'eau pendant 20 minutes (alors qu'il y avait moins de 10 clients à ce moment) et le serveur l'a traité de trou de cul parce qu'il avait osé faire connaître poliment son mécontentement... Bref, plus jamais."}
{"text":"Très bien situé, à deux pas du métro Mont Royal.
Niveau ambiance cest très cool, bonne musique (parfois un peu trop forte quand même), bon accueil des serveurs.
Carte plutôt complète Avec Burgers, wraps, tartares, etc Un des gros plus : les frites sont faites maison et la qualité générale est au rendez-vous !
Bref, bonne adresse !"}
{"text":"Loved this cute place! The vibe was chill and relaxed. We had great service and our waitress was a doll. I ordered the West Coast wrap and it was so good! My hubbs had the chicken supreme and i tasted it and I usually hate chicken breast but his dish was delicious! Portion size for our dishes was huge! Good value for money (and it was wasn't overly priced). Would love to visit again!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this place for brunch, I've had a great time. Indoors you will be surrounded by an eclectic decor while the patio will put you right in the action of Mont-royal street.

They have tasty and elaborate cocktails that can kick start an awesome afternoon! The strawberry crepes are a delicious addition to the full sweet and salty breakfast and let's not talk about the homemade (pulled) ham. Benedicts and omelets are also a tasty choice!"}
{"text":"Ambiance sympa pour un brunch,restaurant situé à quelques pas du métro Mont royal.
Petite terrasse sur l'avant de l'établissement,agréable lorsque le temps le permet"}
{"text":"The food was actually great. Service was OK. Just need to say that in our case they lost money on drinks, cause we cut our visit short due to the crappy music selection, the sound was also too loud, hard to have a conversation. It was some very unpleasant commercial teenager hip hop, like Rihanna and alike. In 90 minutes the only thing pleasant was Everything but the girl and B-52s. Worst thing is that they had a DJ. Put some Bossa Nova or lounge, something that won't be unpleasant to anyone."}
{"text":"A cold night in Montreal was warmed by my fabulous white bean, quinoa and tomato soup, a glass of wine and a salad full of health and freshness at Les Folies. The service was warm and friendly. Didn't try the entrees but you have lots to choose from for the vegetarian and the carnivore. Feels like a neighborhood spot where locals would come back. Only complaint-very dimly lit. Perhaps candles on the tables would brighten the atmosphere. Would give it 31/2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. The food comes in big portions and the quality is amazing. The service is also some of the best I've ever experienced! 10/10 will come back again."}
{"text":"My sister loves this place. I love this place. And we never agree. We hold this place close to our heart. Last time we were there we went to town on their sangria, and I think we shared something to eat in between, I don't remember. Sangria, ole!

They have a charming little patio. I say charming because it's pretty small and can get cramped but is a great terrace to eat or drink in the summer. The interior is your quaint diner - booths, tables, and sit up bar.

The food isn't elaborate, just good flavours and well-prepared dishes. Here are three perfect plates.  I'm partial to the last one, because I love croque monsieur.

Les Folies? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Un brunch matinal entre filles au resto Les folies!

Pour un moment convivial et gourmand entre filles, n'hésitez pas à choisir le resto Les folies sur Mont Royal. Après avoir pris quelques dizaines de minutes pour découvrir le menu. J'opte pour un brunch bénédictine nordique et je ne suis pas déçue. Saumon sur un muffin anglais toasté nappé de sauce hollandaise accompagné de pomme de terre et de fruit. Une moment gustatif revigorant pour entamer mon dimanche comme il se doit. L'endroit est sympa car pas trop grand donc pas trop bruyant. Le personnel convivial et le décor vous transporte dans un vrai dinner. Enfin bref, une vraie bonne découverte. La prochaine fois, je me ferais encore plus plaisir et j'opterais pour un cocktail matinal au cava ;-)"}
{"text":"We dined on the crowded patio, with a noisy young crowd full of smokers. Service was ok, food - the same. A nice, but somewhat uncomfortable, spot for people watching.
We had Croque Mexicain, Croque Monsieur, Penne Pesto, and a Crepe Fraise. The Croque Mexicain was kinda weird and not really Mexican. The Croque Monsieur was good! Penne and Crepe Fraise were just ok.
Prices were a bit higher than I'd like."}
{"text":"The breakfast here was awesome! Definitely different than the typical fatty American breakfast."}
{"text":"Endroit convivial et sympa, à 2 pas du métro Mont Royal, avec de la bonne musique du moment (par exemple en ce moment, Despacito y passe souvent, même plusieurs fois dans la même heure..!!)
Les nachos sont très bonnes, croustillantes, possibilité de prendre un extra poulet (saveur curry un peu)
4@7 sur Sangria, bière, vin (6$)
Service très agréable
Terrasse au top pour les beaux jours
A essayer!"}
{"text":"The Poutine with Duck Breast was SO bad. I ordered it thinking my poutine would have a nice piece of duck breast on top of it- but the duck come out shredded with a bad taste. 

$15 dollars isn't a big deal for GOOD poutine, but it is so not worth it for unpleasant tasting ones. Menu needs to clarify that the meat is shredded because it makes a huge difference to some customers."}
{"text":"Super bouffe. On voit qu'ils ont mis un peu d'efforts sur le menu. Service ok, sans plus. Faut pas être pressé."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Montreal from Los Angeles. I came for Sunday brunch and it is BUSY. The staff here has been kind, gracious warm and welcoming from the miniute we walked in despite how busy it is. Food is incredible and cooked to perfection.  Water glasses and coffee mugs were filled often by a smiling and winking  staff member. Thank you for filling my belly and soul with joy!"}
{"text":"We have been here for a late dinner a few times. Portions are very large and food is decent, but nothing too special. I was surprised that the club sandwich was made with chicken or turkey salad (mixed with mayo) rather than sliced meat. My husband found the croque monsieur tasty but difficult to eat. I did really like the fries. The patio seems nice (was too cold to use the times we went), and I would be interested in trying the brunch."}
{"text":"Beau petit resto bien situé surtout dans le plateau, c'est gagnant! La terrasse en été c'est tellement agréable et l'ambiance est vraiment cosy quoique l'intérieur est vraiment petit et serré. Super bon service et la rapidité est vraiment bonne."}
{"text":"Had brunch with friends there and left pretty happy. The food and ambiance were good. I booked a table over the phone a day before - but when we arrived they said they don't take reservations (but had a couple of free tables, so it wasn't a big deal). We sat inside and it was not too noisy to have a conversation. It was hard to get the waitress's attention when we wanted to order another side (the patate maison is great) after receiving our meal, and again when we wanted the check, but we weren't in a rush to leave, so it was not too bad. I think the service could be more attentive (and they could probably use more servers to achieve that), so I give them only 4 starts to an otherwise 5 stars meal."}
{"text":"We decided on the whim to eat here. The food was decent. But, we had a little problem with the service. We were served improperly. The waitress was not cognisant of our plates and her attitude was unacceptable. Perhaps, she was having a bad day. I would definitely eat there again & give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Leur burger de bison et brie. C'est tout ce que j'ai à dire.

Non ok, j'ai d'autres commentaires quand même. 

Je ne suis pas une mangeuse de viande, mais il m'est difficile de résister à un bon burger. Cuisson parfaite, du brie tout fondant, des oignons caramélisés à l'érable, des champignons sauté au vin rouge, une sauce épicée, des frites parfaitement salées et une salade pour nous déculpabiliser. Tellement bon que quand j'y suis retournée pour une deuxième fois, je n'ai pas pu résister; j'ai repris la même assiette! Ils font aussi de bons cocktails originaux, et quand tu commandes un Black Velvet le gars arrive avec une cannette de Guiness et une bouteille de cidre qu'il mixe devant toi dans un verre, avant de te laisser le reste des deux bouteilles si tu veux re-remplir ton verre lorsqu'il est fini. C'est comme 2 drinks pour le prix d'un! Et le dessert.. oh le dessert! Une des meilleures mousses au chocolat que j'ai gouté de ma vie! Sur le nouveau menu elle n'est malheureusement plus disponible, mais ils ont mis un gâteau à la mousse au chocolat et coulis aux fruits des champs, je vais mener mon enquête gustative puis je vous reviens...  

Ils font aussi des déjeuners que je veux absolument essayer (Oeuf bénédictines prosciutto grillé et sauce hollandaise au chipotle? I'm all in.), dès que je me trouve une bonne excuse.

Pourquoi un 4 étoiles avec un menu qui semble aussi exquis? À cause du service, qui est très moyen et lent, la musique un peu trop forte et les chaises qui se cognent parce que c'est tassé. Mais là je repense au burger. Et à la mousse..."}
{"text":"We tried to go to L'avenue  for brunch on a Sunday at 1pm  bc of the amt of great reviews but the line up to the place was out the door so we tried this place instead and we loved it ! There was barely no wait ( under 5 minutes ), the waitress was super nice and most importantly, the food and service was perfect !

I had the grilled proccuitto (sp?) Benedict and It was amazing . My husband got the smoked salmon Benedict,which was great as well.

I would 100 percent reccomend this place to friends and family visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I visited with a friend and we enjoyed the entire experience. We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful Saturday night. We chose Les Folies because we thought it looked super cute and had a great ambiance. 

I had the steak Poutine, which was delicious. The fries were thin cut and crispy and the steak was a nice addition to make it a meal. My friend had the Cali chicken sandwich which she also enjoyed. 

Overall, the combination of the fun atmosphere on the patio, nice waitress and excellent food made it a great night out."}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning and I get that all brunch places would be packed... anyways after waiting for 45 mins (we were second in the line and the host could have made a space for us by moving two chairs but she didn't) we were seated on the patio ... the service was awful I was kindda like trying to reach the server's attention to ask for something .. It took another 40 minutes to bring our food. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"For the price and location, I'll give them 5 stars..minus 1 for the smoking on the patio. I am surprised smoking on patios is still legal in Montreal! It sure isn't in California. As I'm pregnant, the smokers were annoying but eh, it's Montreal.. what do ya expect?

Anyway, the food is yummy!!! Their poutine was DEVOURED in seconds. I ordered a side of poutine along with my veggie burger. Everything was delicious! Our waitress was a sweetheart. What a cool place :) Literally across the street from the metro."}
{"text":"C'est pas la folie...  On y était pour le brunch. Bénédictines bacon et Burger au bison servis au bout de 40 minutes d'attente. C'était bien fat et j'ai été déçue du Burger le seul point positif la terasse."}
{"text":"I want to start this review off by pointing out that I am a picky eater. I am that person who only finds one thing on the menu to eat. With that said - I loved this place. I had the pesto and it was delicious.  I also ate my brother's French fries and they were perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crispy.  Great music and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"J'adore la déco de ce restaurant! On dirait un mix entre un « dinner» rétro et un bateau. Le bar est en inox, les fauteuils rappellent les sixties et il y a un hublot dans la salle de bains.
Côté menu, nous étions six personnes, chacun de nous a pris quelque chose de différent et pourtant chacun a trouvé qu'il avait pris le meilleur burger de la carte! Dans le mien il y avait une petite sauce au chèvre à se damner! Mon voisin a pris le sandwich mexicain avec une super sauce salsa, épicée et relevée au poil. Les frites étaient croustillantes à souhait et si j'ai oublié ce qu'avaient pris les autres, je vous invite à le tester par vous-même, car je suis quasiment sûre que ce sera une bonne surprise.  
Autre petit détail super sympa : la carte des boissons!  Elle offre un très large choix de cocktails depuis les softs drinks jusqu'aux mélanges à bases de Guru ou Red Bull, en passant par des chocolats chauds ou cafés aromatisés (comprenez « alcoolisés »...) et sans oublier des smoothies aux fruits tout ce qu'il y a de plis santé.
Bref, je suis complètement fan de ce restaurant! A faire et refaire indéfiniment!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing locals spot that delivers in every way, from the food, drinks, vibe, and music, we loved it so much that we came back the next day to try more of their brunch offerings! Some highlights included: The red sangria (full of fresh berries and had a well balanced, not too sweet taste), Salmon Gravlax (salmon was not too smokey), crepes (plain or stuffed, they were excellent!), and duck benedict (top meal by far). Can't wait to return to Montreal and try even more!"}
{"text":"Restaurant parfait pour un lunch avec des amis. Je sais qu'ils offrent plusieurs boissons alcoolisées le soir, mais le jour, c'est calme et la nourriture est délicieuse! J'ai pris une grosse salade avec canneberges et avocats, et j'ai pu changer la vinaigrette pour du vinaigre balsamique et de l'huile d'olive pour que ce soit végétalien! Les ingrédients étaient très frais et savoureux! Bon service et parfait pour discuter sans trop de bruit."}
{"text":"Wonderful ceasers! I had the poached eggs with salad the service was great. If you want to feel healthy and satisfied at the same time! Reasonable prices for the area too!"}
{"text":"This was a dinner I wish never happened. My friends and I waited at least 10 minutes to get service and the restaurant wasn't even half full. We ordered French onion soup, salmon tartare, quesadilla, and veggie burger with fries. 

The soup was overly salty, and to my surprise had chunks of beef brisket in it. Tartare had too much dressing I could not taste the fish. My friends said the veggie burger was meh but the fries were excellent. Quesadilla was nothing memorable.

The only time we really received service was when we paid for our dinner.  I will stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place late at night when we were looking for some place to eat. The atmosphere of this place is great and filled with energy. Our waiter were very friendly. There was also a live DJ playing music, which was definitely a plus.

Our table got three burgers and one wrap. The food all seemed to be fresh. The food comes with a tasty salad and a big side of fries. I got the citaden burger."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when I was looking for a brunch place with some good vegan options (egg allergies make brunch very tricky). 

Love the variety on the menu and we all ordered different things and were very happy with the food. The eggs in their breakfast plates are done wonderfully and if you give them more specific instructions for how you like your scrambled eggs they will successfully execute. 

The service was great, very causal which fit the overall feel of the place and really welcome you to sit for a while and enjoy your meal. My only problem (and thus the 4 star rating) was with their coffee which was just meh."}
{"text":"This place gave me one of my worst restaurant experience I ever had. Do not get me wrong folks, I had huge expectations out of this place. I missed three events of few close friends, but couldnt make it for whatever reasons. Anyway one night me, my brother and my mom went looking for some family time out. I suggested patati patata but it wasnt as intimate so my brother said he wanted to come check out folies, so with my final motion ahead we came here. 

We got seated yes. And the waiter took forever to come. At a point they even switched the waiters around. I was shocked seeing my waiter chatting with the table beside us with my glass empty. I kept asking the other waitress if she had anything with lime, or even just plain lime water. Her reply.. no. She was having trouble communicating, and even though me and my brother were fine with French I could see her clearly getting frustrated. I dont how but somehow I gues because of the weather I got a realy nasty flu and was burning up fast, so we had to cut the dinner short. The waitress never bothered to come back for more water, or even ask if we were \"okay\" let alone needed anything. After waiting for the longest while my brother had to literally walk to the waitress in the front to ask her to pass us the bill. 

I guess he was just worried that with my fever and getting angry I wouldve just walked out without billing. I may have just done that. May have... Anyway my brother just paid everything on the counter itself. We left as quickly as we could. The staff never bothered with a smile/or a come again/or even an embarrasment about how we were treated. 

With all my anger aside, I dont care if your food is good/okay/great/unedible or whatever. Nothing makes anything worse then bad customer service a la max, especially when someone is sick. If not a little hospitality I would expect some little consideration. I get it, its a low lighted and loud restaurant, not the best pick for me at the time of, but the most I couldve gone was some fast service when I needed. This could have been easily a good review if anyone from this place had some little decency. I will Never Ever come back here again."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup ce restaurant situé sur le plateau. Cela faisait très longtemps que je n'y étais pas revenue voulant découvrir de nouveaux endroits dans le coin. Toutefois, je dois dire que Les Folies est incontournable du quartier. Le restaurant est quand même petit, donc je présume que les lignes d'attente doivent être significatives durant le week end, toutefois en semaine ce n'est pas un problème. Le restaurant propose des déjeuners tous les jours ainsi qu'une formule lunch. La nourriture est fraîche, le service est excellent et le menu diversifié. J'ai beaucoup aimé les crepes maison que l'on m'a servi ainsi que le goût des pommes de terre. De plus, la petite salade de fruits était excellente, ce qui est fort apprécié souvent les fruits goûtent pas grand chose et ils ne proposent qu'un choix ridicule. Je le recommande fortement !!"}
{"text":"On a random Monday we went to this one because the adjacent poplar brunch place is too busy. Food is mediocre and service is slow. Price is on the higher end for what it's worth. I got the coco-gravlax and its just some salmon that tastes like, well, salmon. One thing that I don't like about this restaurant is there are at least 3 waiters hanging around flirting with the customers and yet that one girl is running around taking care of the whole place. We sat for at least 15 minutes before given a chance to order coffee; and considering my only reason to walk in was because it was quite empty and I was desperately hungry, I failed."}
{"text":"What a find! I went with a party of eight and we ordered a wide variety of entrees. Everything was delicious - as evidenced by eight empty plates. The waiter was bilingual, knowledgable about the menu and very friendly. The atmosphere was hip and there was a DJ who played a tasteful curated mix throughout dinner. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Les Folies 

Un de mes endroit favori de MTL et sans doute un des lieux cult et des plus ancien fréquenté dans ma vie à Montréal où je viens seul, avec des amiEs et toutes ces dates devenues amantes. :)
Avec le Pub du Quartier et le Laïka : c'est indéniablement ma Troika de plaisirs gustatif, beat culture et cocktails de choix.

J'ai vu passé ici 5 administrations depuis la mi des années 1990 et étonament, il y a eu une continuité dans la culture de l'établissement, dans les saveurs de ces jus et cidres exquis (je vous jure: essayez le Sapphir ou l'Africain) et dans les plats sexy et folies à deux.

Tout est bon, beau et agréable ici.  Rencontre inclus!  Services sourriants!

Même si plus récement je connais moins le staff vu mon exile du Plateau, chaque fois que j'y repasse: je me sens comme si c'était hier ave a gang d'Abdel et Andrée et ont me traite toujours comme l'un des roi des Folies!

Je fais plus que recommander ce lieux, je vous y invites sans hésiter!

Comme je suis fou, fou de la vie, fou des papilles, fou des filles, les Folies sont folles alliées avec moi! 

Qui sait mesdames, peut-être notre premier rencart se fera là et je vous offrirai le cidre-jus typique des Folies: l'Aphrodisiaque!

La Folie c'est la santé du bien-être avec soi!   Longue vie aux Folies, institution de mon coeur et de mon monde intérieur.

Plüs
Ici je viens depuis 1995. C'est l'un de mes endroits préféré, énergisant même!  L'Africain: un jus frais de mangue et ananas avec gingembre un délice!  Essayé aussi leur cocktail érotique pour accompagner l'assiette Folie à deux... osé le lors d'une première date :-)"}
{"text":"Un de mes endroits favoris pour le brunch ou le lunch. Les plats sont bons (sans sortir de l'ordinaire). Essayez un des wraps et, s'il y a de la place, profitez de la terrasse. Mon second choix si le restaurant L'Avenue, quasiment juste en face, est plein."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this cute little restaurant on Mont-Royal. It's really well situated (2 seconds from the Mont-Royal metro station). The food is cheap, fresh and tasty. The burgers are amazing and come with a huge side of fries and a salad. 

Perfect for a late dinner on friday night before going out (they have a live DJ and really good music), not so perfect if you want an intimate ambiance because it is quite small and gets pretty loud."}
{"text":"Prompt seating. Kind of a diner/bar vibe, but cool. The ordering process took a while. Their poutine is apparently their signature dish. The fries were not too shabby, and the gravy had great flavor and texture (albeit a bit cool). The curds were a bit tough (none melted, some squeaked some didn't). The side of crispy bacon came underdone. Overall poutine score: 2.9"}
{"text":"Nice patio, but full of smokers. Inside looked like they were trying to be a retro diner, but not quite. Right when you walk in is a DJ-CD-mixing thingy and a couple of disco balls so looks like it turns into a hip lounge after hours. 

They were still serving breakfast at 1:30 on a Tuesday afternoon so we partook. I had the Les Folies with everything - 2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, 2 crepes, potatoes, 1 fat piece of toast cut into triangles and heavily buttered, 2 slices of Swiss cheese, beans, and fruit. It tasted like good diner food, bacon not perfectly crisp, nothing too greasy, all quite filling. 

On tv was extreme sports, specifically base jumping and sky diving, then rock climbing without any safety measures save landing in a body of water. Service ok. Accepts credit cards. Cute place for a meal. Love that the only other couple inside was still there after we left - and I eat real slow. Few others trickled in. Serves alcohol, looked like a full bar."}
{"text":"very blend food but they have a success at getting ppl in from its warm and cozy terrace which i myself can't resist living so close for the days where i really don't have anything to cook for breakfast and im lazy to walk any further"}
{"text":"Ok. Ok. Ok. Can i just say that what saves this place really is the service and the terrace. Mostly the great service! The menu, the food itself is nothing out of this world and you can probably make it better if cooked at home. Not that the food is bad. Just behhh! The drinks are ok but on the expensive side. Portions are good. Service, once again, is superb! I only come here once a year when it's the start of the construction vacation. The foreman, somehow, loves it here! But do i like paying 15,95$ for a burger? Not really. 16,50 for a plate of frozen raviolis?  No, not at all! But once again, service is really nice. Well...our waitress was flawless! She's very patient, attentive and professional! Will i come back here? No. Not if i don'g have to."}
