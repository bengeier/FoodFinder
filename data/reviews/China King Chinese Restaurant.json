{"text":"Last Friday my husband and I ordered chicken with broccoli.  The chicken was boiled dry. The onion should have been in last week's garage.  Sauce was tasteless.  Only the brocoli was ok. For the cost of an onion you lost 3 customers."}
{"text":"If you're looking for soggy chicken tenders (oily and mushy) then this is the place for you!   Crab Rangoon's were very lackluster.  I don't even really know Edgar to say about them besides maybe order something else?   Had hot and sour soup, which wasnt very good, had a lot of beef stock.  Lots of random vegetables, even a mystery meat!  No tofu in this soup, just a mystery meat!   Moved on to Sesame Chicken from there.  That was a mistake to order.   The chicken is about the size of Long John silvers chicken tenders.  Drenched in Sesame sauce, which was kind of sour.  Actually I don't know if the sauce was sour, or the frying oil was rancid.   We won't be back... Ever...    Only saving grace is the waitress was awesome!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese restaurant.  Can always count on excellent food.  Egg rolls are excellent and wonton soup never too salty.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The only reason it didn't get one star was because the waitress was super, super nice. Otherwise, the food was a few notches below airport or mall Chinese food. I literally have had a bad taste in my mouth all the way home, so much so I need to brush my teeth after eating here. I'm wondering how much MSG was in that food, wow.  Again, the waitress was awesome. But the food is not good. I was told they have been in business there for 29 years. That just tells me the people in that neighborhood have no idea what good Chinese food is. Hope this Yelp review saves someone else from eating there. Nothing personal to the owners, but we did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken and I ordered the spicy beef noodles or something like that (121 on the menu). Everything on my husband's plate came out horrible. The chicken was overcooked and dry, the bread crumb coating on the chicken was soggy and the white rice was hard. For my dish, i ordered the spiciness of the noodles to be mild. I love spicy foods and that was overwhelmingly spicy for mild. I had to cut the spiciness of the noodles with my husband's poorly cooked rice. The noodles in it were supposed to be lo mein but when I saw it, it reminded me of spaghetti noodles. There was also a certain sourness to the dish that was unpleasant.  I was excited when I saw the almond cookie that was bought to our table at the end of the tragic experience because I love almond cookies. Being Chinese I grew up eating them. My husband took one bite and started pulling faces and telling me how it tasted disgusting. When I took a bite of the cookie, I was also greatly disappointed. It tasted odd and stale.  The only positive thing part of our experience there was the service. The waitress was nice and attentive and even refunded my husband's food which I thought was reasonable considering he only ate half of a piece of the sweet and sour chicken and a small mouthful of rice."}
{"text":"I'm completely biased but whenever I visit my parents in Brunswick, we usually get takeout from China King - and I love it! It's fast, hot and consistent. They have the best General Tso's chicken!  I can't speak to a dine-in experience as I haven't eaten inside the restaurant in years."}
{"text":"We normally get the take out but this time we dined in.  The food and service was wonderful.  The place was busy and still the service was great.  Had the family dinner this time and it was excellent.  Comment on other reviews:  Don't go to any restaurant when it is about to close.  People at the restaurant work hard all day and want to go home.  The enthusiasm might not be as good as earlier in the day. Even the best restaurants can be off some days."}
{"text":"Epic fail.   The only reason this place gets any stars is bc the girl at the front desk was nice and the food came out fast.  Fail #1: They don't deliver :(  Fail #2: Bad food.  Fail #3: Decor was a bit much. Tone it down guys  Do not, I repeat, do NOT order sweet and sour chicken, or you will be greatly disappointed. The pieces were the size of half a chicken breast and the breading was a mushy heap of oil. Very unappetizing to bite into. I literally bit into a piece and oil squirt into my mouth. That was my last bite.  Smaller chicken would probably fry much better. And for the love of God, please put the sweet & sour sauce on the side...Not everyone enjoys their food doused in sauce. My giant oil mushed chicken was literally swimming. The fried rice was strange but at least it tasted ok. The eggrolls were obviously frozen, as they were still cold on the inside, and again, loaded with grease. I really hope someone teaches this place how to cook.  This place reminded me of a restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares with Chef Ramsey.  I think China King would be much better if they stopped trying to be different, because those differences are clearly disasters."}
{"text":"I know it's crazy but we have been getting our take out New Year's Eve dinner from here for the past 20 years!  Always the same thing - Chicken & Broccoli, Pork Lo Mien, Won Ton Soup, Ribs, Egg Rolls, a side of Golden Fingers.  What can I say, we enjoy it. It's been at least 12 years since we dined inside and I agree with the other reviews that it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Volume volume volume!!!!! I like volume!!! They serve it here too!!!  It's obviously not authentic but you should know that going in... Tempura chicken slightly hot works for me! The Wonton was quite nice, simple, tasty and a great start to the meal. Rice fresh and tasty, threw some spice on it to warm it up and I was quite pleased! It's not avant garde fusion Chinese...Just simple chinese'sh belly food!!!"}
{"text":"I think it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyways), good Chinese food is hard to find (and great Chinese food is damn near impossible.) Well, this is neither. I will continue to eat it though because the choices are few and it is close to home."}
{"text":"Got take out from here and it was just ok. Food was warm, but not really that good. The crab rangoons weren't anything special and the sweet n sour chicken was very saucy but didn't have much flavor. Strange that there wasn't any chicken friend rice too. Probably won't try it again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. Actually, I think this was the very first restaurant I ever went to when I was a little boy. It was always a treat!  Great food! Love the Almond Chicken and Wonton Soup. Awesome family that runs the place. Long time friends of our family. Highly recommended. A Brunswick institution!   Skipped class a few times in high school to come here for lunch and Betty, the owner, never told my parents. It was our secret; although she did scold me for skipping class and I had to promise to go back to school after eating.   When I ran for political office in 2004, I held court here at least three times a week! Lots of memories! Oh, to be young again...(and thinner)."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 20 years. The food is great and the owners and employees among the friendliest in customer service. Just because they don't deep fry frozen processed chicken and instead cook whole chicken strips in their great sauce and authentic Chinese peppers I think the people leaving negative reviews are just victims of the mall foodcourt generation."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to China King right before seeing a movie across the street. I had decent hopes for the place, as outside it has some decent decorations.  We walk inside to find a paying customer complaining \"I can't believe you guys don't have chocolate ice cream!\". Yes, all Chinese restaurants should serve chocolate ice cream, apparently. This is apparently the clientle which drives the menu of this place.  The menu had the typical Chinese-American fare (without chocolate ice cream, though). I got an overly-sweet plum wine to drink. Egg-drop soup that didn't exactly smell the best. The vegetarian options were somewhat dismal, one dish touting \"___ with Oyster Sauce\" in the veggie section, and only one dish containing tofu. I ordered that, and out came a plate of veggies and fried tofu in a completely flavorless water sauce. Mmm... flavorless chewy tough tofu.  Not impressed. Next time I'm in Ohio, I'll be sure not to go back here."}
{"text":"I noticed this place only had one review (and one star at that!), so I HAD to write one. I don't know what \"Brian S. from Austin, TX\" is talking about.  When I was 2 years old, I moved to Brunswick with my parents. We ordered food from China King often while I was growing up. When I was a little bit older, we moved 25 minutes away and still made the drive about once a month just to get their food. I'm 25 now and I've lived all over the country (including California, Brian, practically the Asian food capital of America). China King is still the standard by which I judge Chinese food and every time I go home for a holiday, et cetera, we always order China King and enjoy it together as a family.  So... the food: Oh, so good. They have the best Egg Foo Young I've ever had. I had a shrimp Egg Foo Young once in New Orleans that came close (and I knew the family that owned the restaurant, so I know they were making me their best), but STILL it was not as good as China King's.   Their General Tso's chicken is epic awesome. Other Chinese food restaurants tend to use tiny little pieces of chicken all hacked-up and gross looking. China King uses huge pieces of white meat. So much better.  Their House Wonton is perfect for a gloomy day.   Anyway, yeah. Go to China King. I guarantee it's better than any Chinese in the area. Plus, it's a family business. I've got 25 years of China King experience and I can tell you that I've never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"This place is built to trick Americans or at least to give people misconceptions of what Chinese food is. (And yes, this is personal, it's a shame) Firstly we Chinese use white rice when there is rice dishes instead of the weird yellow fried rice that this restaurant is putting into each meal. Could it be because the rice is not fresh anymore (cooked from a few days back?) so they need to add flavor to cover the original bad flavor of the rice? Secondly, the high intensity of oil, sweets and sour makes it no different from the Panda Express across any streets. It looks like they are always using deep frying, very dense sauces to cover the original flavor of materials.  Thirdly, it looks like the spring roll has been fried for so many times! Last but not the least, the owner/whoever's standing behind the counter doesn't even speak Chinese - which literally will make you doubt the authenticity of the restaurant. Literally, an Americanized Chinese restaurant can be very delicious and comforting, and always welcomes you to come back, but this place just doesn't represent that level of good Americanized Chinese food. I have given it so many chances and none of the dishes has been meeting my expectation. Maybe mushroom covered rice, but I absolutely cook MUCH better than that."}
