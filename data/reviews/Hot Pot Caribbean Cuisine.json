{"text":"I've tried to eat too many times at this place and can't seem to \"love\" it. The atmosphere is clean, quiet and I would suggest at least put some Jamaican songs in the background to attract flies. The only thing to me that is so so is the beef patty, but nothing beats New York...I can taste the difference. It's definitely not Golden Krust. I've had their jerk chicken with rice, again to me it tasted funny. I really don't think they're from the Eastcoast. So instead of complaining about it, I stopped going there period. I'll get to taste the real deal when i'm in Florida."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  You must try any of the desserts.  Brown stew chicken, jerk chicken are my favorites.  Ambience is simple and comfortable.  I have been here 5 or 6 times since my family has been away."}
{"text":"My siblings and I had dinner here today June 27th 2017. It was 5 of us plus a child.. everyone sent their dish back except my sister and I (and she didn't finish her food). They complained about the food being basic and tasteless.. I generally review for outstanding food and superb service. So I'm saddened to leave such a crappy review for a small business. My siblings had to be polite and explain it was their first time eating Jamaican food. I'm not sure where the great reviews are from but hey.. there's literally no taste to the food and the cakes which are $4.50 a piece are DRY! Very sad day for our palates. Plus my oxtails barely had meat! It was all bone.. Save your palate and get your Jamaican food some place else."}
{"text":"Had the delicious curry goat with beans and rice and vegetables. Fantastic. My wife had the jerk chicken which was also really good. Service was also great."}
{"text":"I would skip - except for the seafood, the food is not made fresh to order, so who knows how long it's been sitting out there.  Rice and beans are pretty bland and tasteless.  Goat curry - watch out for the bones - not much flavor, just something to eat.  Jerk chicken is spicy and saucy.  Would rather try another restaurant before coming back to this one.  For the price, portion sizes seem a little on the small side."}
{"text":"The stew chicken, rice and peas, and plantain are good. Customer service and phone etiquette could use some training. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really like this place despite a couple major flaws, I was there a week or so ago and I love the goat curry, the problem I had was the large amount of bone fragments in the curry. Had to go CSI on my lunch to make sure I didn't get anything stabbing me in the throat. I love the flavor of the food though, the spicy feeling is amazing"}
{"text":"Fish Friday!  Free beer while you wait... oxtail, jerk chicken, curry, fish, no matter what you get you won't be disappointed! Get here early cuz it stays pretty busy. If you plan on getting meat or veggie patties call in early to reserve some cuz they're usually gone by noon :("}
{"text":"Incredible!  Very friendly service and wonderful food.  My husband and I tried the brown stew chicken and the oxtail.  Both excellent!  Prices were very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is so far the best I have tried in Phoenix. The jerk chicken is perfectly spicy, brown rice and beans are good even better with the hot sauce, the plantains are decent I'm just not a big fan of them.  The restaurant is clean, fun bright colors and cariibean music playing in the background. I've been coming here for years and plan on for the years to come. And the price is a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of Hot Pot as I've had the curry goat a few times and I have to conclude that it is in fact 'the truth'!  Her curry friggin goat is so incredibly delicious that I just had to re-write my review.  My husband had the shrimp which he ate and went back THE SAME DAY for yet ANOTHER order to go for tomorrow!  Crazy delicious.  And she makes her plaintain in that super sweet creamy crunchy way.  Just too delicious.  Oh yeah, her coconut rum cake is also outrageously delicious.  Coconuty, rumy, creamy, moisty, deliciousy - all the 'eeeys'!   If you want authentic and delicous Jamaican food, you have to go!  Update:  4/21/14 Then I had her Akees and salt fish, twice!  OMG!  It was a party in my mouth.  Just to scrumptious.  You've got to check it out."}
{"text":"So, I had The Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas With Plantains and a Beef Pattie. The Jerk Chicken had a good spice to it. I've Been here a few times before this places is pretty good I like the Jerk Chicken I also had The Curry Chicken and The Curry Goat was not a big fan of the Curry Dishes and I do like Curry. But the Patties and the Jerk Chicken I do recommend. The only thing In my mind about this place that is a downer is the prices 12+ and I didn't get full other then that it's a good place to check out. I will good back again"}
{"text":"Delicious! Cannot believe I did not know about this gem earlier! I got the oxtail dish and it tasted so home cooked and full of love. The meat fell right off the bone and was stewed in a yummy sauce, which accompanied the rice and veggies perfectly."}
{"text":"Not what I expected in taste..been to other Jamaican restaurants and was highly pleased but there very sweet and caring but unfortunately I'm so disappointed for the price I expected more on flavor didn't like the rice and beans and oxtails were not at all sticky licking good."}
{"text":"I came in with my family due the good reviews and found the food is terrific. Oxtail and Curry goat are are fabulous.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was so laid back and inviting. It was clean. The food, most importantly, was awesome!! The chicken wasn't too greasy, the vegetables were crisp and not soggy.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very laid back casual spot. Homey feeling, with only a few dishes per day. Jerk chicken is awesome... very spicy, but you can get the hot sauce on the side if you ask for it. I have also tried the beef stew which was great too. Generous portions for the price. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviewers, this place is nice. It's a take-out place of course so don't expect superb ambiance with candle lighting but for what it is, it's perfect.  We got the ox-tail (my favorite of the meats, very tender), the goat curry (very good too and interesting), and the jerk chicken (very spicy which was good, a little dry otherwise). I do have to say though that the sides won my heart... get the beans and rice (yummy and spicy) and the fried plantains (exquisite!). We got all of this, plus a vegetarian hot pot (also very good) and a bottle soda and it came out to just around $30 for the two of us. The leftovers from this, however, also served as the next day's lunch, so two meals in one.  May not be for your less adventurous, Applebees eating friends just as a word of warning :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty and the food had excellent spice. Service was a little slow but I don't mind waiting when the food is good."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing Caribbean food.  I must say the jerk chicken was pretty awesome.  Unfortunately, due to other issues, I will not be returning.  First, there were several items that were not available.  This was disappointing for someone trying this cuisine for the first time.  There were no patties or festival appetizers, nor plantains.  We were told that due to the holiday (MLK Day) they hadn't bothered to make these things in case it wasn't busy.  Second, we had arrived at 6:00 and then waited 40 minutes for the chicken to be ready.  Lastly, the only beverages were bottled drinks in the cooler, no fountain.  My jerk chicken was over $9 without a beverage."}
{"text":"Just had take out after a friend offered to bring me lunch. Jerk Chicken was flavorful, spicy, but not too much (speaking for me, but I like it HOT!) Rice and peas was a little bland and plantains were great! But why so skimpy? Maybe I am a plantain fanatic though since I can eat a massive plateful and still want more. Anywhoo, I am happy to see this addition to the landscape and on this side of town, open later than most simialr establishments. They offer catering as well."}
{"text":"I have been to both Jamaica and Jamaica, Queens and although there is no comparison to the Jerk you will find on the side of the road in Ja The Hot Pot has beaten every where I've been in Jamaica Queens. The Jerk chicken is the best I've had since my trip to the island and though many people are calling it HOT I wouldn't call it that it is a little spicy but it doesn't numb your mouth like chicken wings. Also the rice is not called dirty rice and there are no \"meat pies\" there is rice n peas and patties believe me I've been mocked by my boyfriend for saying such things.  I personally suggest the festivals which are a lot like a Jamaican donuts but they are generally only sold on the weekends. I would defiantly suggest this place to anyone looking for some authentic Jamaican food though I don't believe they sell breakfast food such as ackee."}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried this place out yesterday (8/4/08) and it was great!  As I am from Jamaica I know good Caribbean cuisine from bad and this was the closest thing to home cooking that I have ever found in Arizona. In addition to this it is in a great location. They had patties, Oxtail, Curry Goat, Curry Chicken, Stew Peas, Curry shrimp, Ackee and Saltfish and festival as well great Jamaican sodas (made with real cane sugar as opposed to the high fructose corn syrup found in most sodas).  We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I lived in the Caribbean for two years so we did an immediate U-turn when we drove past this place. I ordered the stew chicken with rice and peas and fried plantains, my husband got the curry goat (with the same sides as me). We knew it would be good when his goat came out with big pieces of bone showing, and we weren't disappointed. Absolutely delicious. Very friendly staff, too. I dropped one star because the prices aren't posted inside and I was shocked when she rang us up - two entrees, 2 (non-alcoholic) drinks, and a slice of coconut rum cake set us back nearly $40 (for a counter service restaurant!). Granted, the portions were enormous and fed us two hearty meals, but looking now at their menu online there are apparently \"mini\" portions available; had those been posted in the store, we would definitely have gotten those instead. Also, they were fresh out of Ting and Old Jamaican ginger beer :(  TL;DR - Surprisingly expensive for such a casual place, but great service and delicious, authentic food (chew carefully :) Will be back (and will order mini portions next time)."}
{"text":"We came last night. The jerk chicken was delicious and the steamed veggies were so good. The service was beyond what we expected and the place was clean. Large portions. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Love the food very very clean. Did I mention the food is the best . Yummy ."}
{"text":"Excellent and interesting food.  Not everyday that you can find Caribbean food here in Phx, and this is really good.  Loved the Oxtail in particular.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Saw an Anthony Bourdain No Reservations in Jamaica show and decided to go there again. Did not disapoint."}
{"text":"Delicious carribean food in a clean, quaint environment. I loved the ambiance and the food is awesome. Service was really perfect.  I came after work and I was so tired. The lady who served us was so nice. It felt like going to an aunts house for dinner. They play nice carribean music softly in the background. I was able to relax and really enjoyed myself. The curry goat is to die for. It is seasoned perfectly and melt in your mouth tender. The jerk chicken was pretty good. The missing star would have to be the peas and rice and the portion size of the jerk chicken. They may need bigger chickens or just give a third piece of chicken for the price. I also could've done without the sweet jerk sauce. (Just want to keep my reviews honest and trustworthy) Believe me I don't waste my time writing bad reviews.  So if I am writing a review the restaurant is worth going to.  All in all, the meal was great and this is a great place for a weeknight meal! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great but the service is amazing as well.  I stopped in with my elderly mother who has never had a curry dish.  The owner was very friendly and helpful in helping her choose a dish she liked. This is a great introduction to Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"The staff was nice and the presentation of the food was great. Facility was very clean and organized.  The food was not up to par. The food wasn't hot, it was borderline luke warm.I ordered the ox tails and curry chicken both with a side of rice and peas with cabbage. Not good at all...I wanted a refund but after sitting at the table and reading a review a guy had to argue with the owner I passed. The worker even noticed I didnt like my meal. I think she hoped for a different answer by asking if was I full because I didn't eat much. I told her it was ok and it was just that. It was ok but not worth the $28 spent. only forced down the oxtails and ate a little of the rice. The oxtail portion was very small 5 pieces. One piece was a the size of a half dollar the other 4 were the size of quarters. The curry chicken dish on the other hand was a good portion as one would expect.     I decided to I leave the curry chicken dish on the table. It was sub par when it came to taste as well. I have eaten at many many Caribbean restaurants. Maybe I went on a bad day for them. Either way it goes the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"I live within 10 minutes walking time of this place and finally made it in there today with some friends after a brown bag @gangplank.  I got the veggie pies as they were the only thing vegetarian,but they were delicious. its easy to miss this place but worth finding and trying."}
{"text":"First time I came here I ordered beef patties.  They didn't have any cooked so I bought them frozen. It was a bit of inconvenience but it was still good!  Today I came once again no cooked beef patties and no frozen patties!! WTH!! Guess I'll find a new Caribbean restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had the beef pockets... WOW had some GREAT flavor and just enough spice!"}
{"text":"I lived less than a mile from this delicious gem for almost 2 years, how have I not eaten here?!  The hubster and I wanted to try something new tonight so I suggested FINALLY trying Hot Pot for S&Gs. I'm very glad we did. It's a tiny little place, but extremely clean. The service was quick and friendly. I wasn't there more than 5 minutes! That's a huge plus in my book.  On the recommendation of the owner, I got the oxtail and the Jerk Chicken. Both were cooked perfectly tender and falling off the bone. The oxtail was savory and the jerk chicken had just the right amount of kick to it. And the dirty rice and cabbage sides were delicious.  Definitely will be going back! I'm so excited to find another great local restaurant so close to home!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and its not our last! We ordered oxtail with rice and beans and plantains for sides oh yummy! My friend liked it so much she ordered a take out for her husband.  The service was excellent and the staff were very nice.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Fast and nice service and yummy food. We split the chicken curry plate and it was enough for the two of us. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff! I ordered the Goat meat. It came with Rice and 1 side. My side was plantains. For the price I paid I'm surprise this establishment does not provide two sides. Nonetheless, I would recommend this place to anyone in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Not only was our service great, our food was delicious. There was raggae island music to give you the feels, clean restaurant area, and everything was perfect. I really can't wait to go back to this place. You can grab take out as well, we saw many people come in for take out. Go give it a try and get the oxtail entree, amazing. Also order the plantains! You can't miss out on that. Unless you don't like sweet, well then just go try the exotic food."}
{"text":"sorry fellow Yelpers.. I really wanted to love this place... so much that I am hoping to go back and trying it again so I can see if it was just an off thing.  My experience was on a Friday.. near 530ish.. empty restaurant (it was just me and hubby) and one lady at the register.  She wasn't friendly by any means until I started asking her about the goat and what cut it was... then she was really sweet and talkative.  He got jerk chicken and I got oxtail.  I've had plenty of oxtail before (in Spain, however) and this was different.  I had expected lots of engaging flavors since it was caribbean, but just found it plain.  I tried the jerk chicken and it, too, was plain considering it was 'jerk' flavored (spicy-sweet).  I did like the cabbage and had her load me up on that over the rice... which btw was white and not the caribbean rice & peas we've had before that is so flavorful.  They were out of goat (understandable) and out of rice and beans (not understandable.. it's a staple).  So, there it is... why I am listing it as a 3 star-experience (her friendliness pushed it to three, I might add)..  I am willing to try it again and see where it goes from there, but for now it's a 3."}
{"text":"Zipped over for lunch after seeing all the great Yelp reviews, and it was a definite experience.  There is no decor. It's noncor. Nadacor. Zerocor. A few tables, sign on the wall, and a counter. The menu was scrawled on a white board behind the counter, and it is the only place I've been in a long time where curry goat is on the menu.   So I'm not going take anyone here for the ambiance - so what? Their food was great. I had the jerk chicken, and it was falling off the bone. Tender, spicy, and incredibly tasty. It came with rice and a salad, and was plenty of food for lunch. I'll definitely come back, next time to try a beef pie.  Maybe I'll get lucky and they'll have goat pie... :)"}
{"text":"This place is truly one Authenic restaurant with delicious food and the best customer service that one can recieve... if your every looking to get some home style Jamaican cuisine then this the place to go.. food is amazing and freshly made daily with lots love..we drove ove 35miles to have the best oaxtail and rice an peas and jerk chicken and authentic home made beef patties.. the patties remind me of my childhood growing up in Brooklyn NY.. it takes me back to one of me best food memories as a kid growing up in the city with many food cultures. I will defiantly be back soon to try all the the specialty Deserts and drinks"}
{"text":"Jamaican food runs in my blood, so I know good food when I taste it. My dad is born and raised in St Elizabeth and  he make the best food I have ever tasted. I recently moved to AZ from Cali and I miss my dad cooking like crazy and when I get home sick I come here. The smells of this place reminds me of my parents home and I love it. They have some really good beef patties, there has close as your going to get to Juicy Beef patties in the states. The food is worth a try if you have never had Jamaican food. I had the oxtails and rice and peas Which is 13.99 plus tax and I caught them as they where closing so no veggies or plantain's where available.   PS. The patties go quick so you have to come really early for them."}
{"text":"I thought we found a good place for great Jerk Chicken, well not this place. for about $10 dollars you get very dry, over cooked, over spicy no flavor chicken that was cut up so bad you had to really be careful eating because of small pieces of sharp chicken bones. then they had a side of veggies which consisted of bland shredded cabbage with shredded carrots, and most of the plate was filled with white rice clumped together with drops of more over spicy Jerk chicken sauce. I was really disappointed with the quality of the food and way to pricey. The customer service, she was nice, the cleanliness was excellent. Too bad about the food. Anyone know of a great Jerk Chicken please let me know."}
{"text":"Sooooo...I tried Ox Tail, not gonna lie, I have always thought \"ew\"...NO WAY! Yuuuuuummmm!! So good! Get you some!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing and authentic Jamaican spot. Their oxtail is to die for and I can't get enough of their beans and rice. My absolute favorite is their sweet and juicy plantains! The portion sizes are huge and can easily be eaten twice. They also have a food truck so be on the look or for that."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Jamaican food. I've heard that it's hard to come around a quality restaurant; however, my boyfriend, who was born and raised in Jamaica, gave this restaurant his stamp of approval - \"best Jamaican spot in Arizona\".   We ordered the oxtail and curry goat and will be returning to try some beef patties!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic caribbean food, my favorite jamaican beef patties , and the melt off the bone brown stew oxtail, w rice and peas There is always interesting desserts like red velvet cake A taste of home, right here in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Love the spicy beef patties.  Reminds me of the Jamaican bakeries back home in ny. The food is amazing.  Fantastic curry and worth trying!"}
{"text":"Ummmm...  If you've lived in Jamaica, are from there  or related to someone who cooks real Jamaican cuisine, or have been to the Pork Pit in Montego Bay, or any other Jamaican restaurant off resort, east coast or Florida....you are going to be disappointed with this place. (With the exception of the patties...close)  If you just want to try Jamaican food, this restaurant will give you an idea of what island food is like.  As in Jamaica, the menu changes daily, and the prices aren't posted.  On our visit they were out of curry goat so I got curry chicken, plantain, and the beef patty.  It was all o.k. But nothing like \"home\".  The cashier was very polite, and it is similar to roadside cafes, small restaurants in Jamaica in decor and atmosphere.  Kind of sparse, but clean(er).  I've only seen two Jamaican restaurants since I've moved to AZ, this one and one in Tempe.  So kudos to them for surviving on consumer curiosity."}
{"text":"Brown sauce chicken is falling-off-the-bone tender and savory.  Best rice and peas (looks like red beans to me) I've had outside of Louisiana.  Friendly, vivacious woman behind the counter.  Felt like I was eating some delicious home cooking, complete with being tended by a welcoming mom.  Don't let the lack of customers at the tables fool you.  While we were there, eating in, a steady stream of other customers dropped by, picking up orders to go.  One man, who intended to take his home, just couldn't wait and promptly sat down and finished off his meal.  This place is a real treat."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little distance from where I am in Scottsdale but was worth the drive. Not a fancy place but comparable to most Jamaican restaurants elsewhere. This isn't Haute Cuisine afterall. Hands down the best Oxtail I have had in Arizona. Ordered it with rice and peas. You get a choice of plantains or vegetables with the meal.The flavor is as good as anything you get in Brooklyn or Miami but a lot more meat on the bones. I washed it down with some jamaican Ginger Beer. I was so impressed that I order the Curry Goat and Jerk Chicken to go plus 2 beef patties and 2 jerk chicken patties. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ox tail is pretty good & the jerk chicken has a nice flavor but the prices are a little expensive for what you get.  This place ain't no fancy dinner option...it's more like a good place to stop for a quick lunch.    The portions are small for dinner but just right for lunch and the dinning room is comfortable and clean but pretty casual.  Food came up fast & the proprietor was helpful and friendly.  Worth a try if your looking for something new but repeat trips are not in my plans."}
{"text":"Ic Tail is awesome and the coconut rum cake is to die for. Go today, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm currently 8 months pregnant and eat at this place at least once a week.  My boyfriend usually picks up the food for us.  My favorite by far is the oxtail with rice and peas plantains and vegetables.  The owner is very friendly but the new girl they hired by far is the sweetest and nicest staff there.  Place is very clean.  Only disappointing thing is that the beef patties which are awesome are gone by around 5 pm.  Love this place and highly recommend it!.."}
{"text":"This was my first return visit from their opening days 6 years ago. They have a better selection of food and as always it is fresh cooked each day by those that know Caribbean food. I had the jerk chicken, beans and rice and cabbage. It was excellent. The place is small but they have a constant stream of patrons.  Depending on the time of the day several menu items may get sold out. The food is made in the morning and when it's gone, it's gone.  This is a testament to the quality and authenticity of the food. It is hand made and not sitting in a freezer waiting to be thawed when ordered. If you've ever been to Jamaica, then you will recognize how authentic this food can be.  The have a limited selection of beer and sodas. Great rum and carrot cakes for desert. There are not many Caribbean places in the Phoenix area and definitely with the quality of Hot Pot. Give it a try if in the area."}
{"text":"Friend recommended this place and I was intrigued. I had authentic Jamaican food when I was down there on a cruise and been meaning to try it again.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a  non-descript decor and the menu is quite simple, with the dishes written down on a whiteboard. I admit I second guessed my choice in coming here based on that, but I'm always willing to try something at least once. Got the Oxtail based on my friends recommendation. The lady who ranged me up was cheerful and nice and I got my food relatively quickly.  It sure smelled good and I opened up my food container with anticapation. A big helping of rice and beans, a cabbage salad, and the oxtail. The oxtail was covered with a generous portion of brown gravy/sauce. Knowing that this was oxtail, I expected a strong flavorful sauce. I was not disappointed.   The sauce was excellent. You can really taste the flavor from the oxtail bones. The meat was quite tender and the mix of the meat, the rice and the sauce made a good mashup of flavors. Even the salad was quite good. It helped with the balance of the meal, offsetting the heaviness of the flavors of the oxtail and rice. Really tasty.   I saved a portion for latter eating, but since I so satisfied with the meal, I wanted to sample some more items. I decided to order some meat pies. I saved those for later also, but when I ate my leftover oxtail and meat pies hrs later, they were still quite tasty.  All in all, a very satisfying meal. I've since visited a couple of times more. Their jerk chicken is excellent also. I'm glad I don't have to take a cruise anytime I want some authentic Jamaican cuisine."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to a Caribbean restaurant I always get curry goat or chicken. This time I wanted something different. Karen was kind enough to recommend Stew Peas which had rice, peas, pork and dumplings. This was accompanied with a side of cabbage. I also had a pineapple soda and coconut rum cake. The environment was friendly, casual and it most importantly felt like home. I will be back again for some more delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"I was born in Jamaica and still enjoy my taste of Jamaica when my mom feels like making certain dishes. It is very tough to find good Jamaican food in Phoenix and my search is over. This place is the best in the valley! So good, that when I told my mom, she took the 50 minute drive from Goodyear to Chandler just to try it and she thought it great. All my fellow \"yawdies\" are working there so you're getting authentic Jamaican cooking.  You can never go wrong with some curry chicken with rice & peas. Finish that off with a ginger beer or some sorrel, you'll be good to go. Whenever I need a taste of Home, this is where I go and where I will continue going."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Jerk chicken since my trip to Jamaica.  Service was excellent, and the awesome food put me back on the beach.   Definitely worth it. Next time I need some spicy jerk, I'll be back there again."}
{"text":"This place is very clean but has the standard tacky profusion of colors dominated by green and gold along with too-loud reggae music that is typical of many a Caribbean restaurant. This is a personal peeve of mine; I would really LOVE to see more Caribbean places 'classed-up' a bit. If nothing else please don't play the music so loudly. Minus 1 star.   On to the flavor! I've had various items from the menu: patties (yum! If you're lucky to get one), curried goat, jerk chicken, escovitch fish (heavenly and well worth the wait!), plantains, veggies- all good. Several reviewers complained about the bones in the goat curry- you guys are hilarious! If you went to any Caribbean home this is exactly what you would get. In fact, you're hard pressed to find bone free meat in any Caribbean restaurant in the Caribbean unless they are catering primarily to tourists. Chomping on a bone is just part of the experience. I would concede that perhaps given the amount of bones in the curry goat that it should be less expensive.  Just a thought- it's 'no never mind' to me since I rarely order this.   Takeaway: If you want authentic Caribbean flavor this is the spot. If you want the Americanized version of Caribbean food you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the energy, smell, and feel of this restaurant. Our server was not outside when we entered, which was not a problem. we had a little time to look at what we were going to order before we rang the bell. When the server came out she was very helpful and VERY knowledgeable about the menu and how things are prepared. It is our first time eating Caribbean food so we really didnt know what to get. Our server was Nicola she is AWESOME! Everyone should come down. They're very friendly and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Wow... Was not expecting to have real authentic jerk chicken when I woke up this morning!  Loved everything about this place.  The plantains and beans and rice were good, but the jerk chicken was great.  My mouth is still burning (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Overall:  Most authentic Jamaican food I've had in the US, bar none.  And I really am something of a junkie.  Food:  Excellent. Generous portions, full of flavor, just like if you were on the island.  Service:  Nice people, good service.  Menu is a bit iffy... they make what they make and when it's gone, it's gone.  So if you go later in the day, you may not get what you were hoping for.  Prices:  A bit high, but not outrageous.  Pretty fair for the fact that they only make what they can serve in a day, etc."}
{"text":"We had the jerk chicken dinner with red beans & rice and fried plantains. TIC TIC BOOM...BOMB! The chicken was moist and juicy. The jerk spice was just right. Just enough to let you know its there. The oxtail plate was our favorite. The gravy/sauce they cook it in I so damn good, I would've eaten on an old shoe. The oxtails & chicken were fall off the bone tender. But wait...there's more! The beef or chicken patties must have crack baked right in because we couldn't stop eating them. I ALMOST bought the whole case. I bought six and we ate them ALL in one day. I've never eaten in the dining room but it looks carribean & the reggae music playing was fine. But I came for the food & didn't leave disappointed. Get after this one."}
{"text":"OK, so I heard on the radio this guy raving about Jamaican Beef patties, so I was curious to try it.  My son and I made a trip to Arizona and right near where we were staying was this joint inside a strip mall. We ordered the Jerky Chicken, the Ox tail curry, the shrimp curry, and the mutton curry (we had 3 others join us there, one minor) Everything was great!  Delicious! Surprised how soft the Ox tail and the mutton meats were. We ordered a couple of ginger beer from the fountain that was served on two tall styrofoam cups. We also ordered a piece of Jamaican rum cake, also delicious, very strong rum flavor! Wow So anyway, the only disappointing thing was that a 15% tip was added on! WTF? For 5 people? I thought it was for only tables of 8 or more??? I mean don't get me wrong, I would have tipped anyway, but when you serve drinks in styrofoam cups, and you also have a tip jar at the cash register, you can't pretend to be a full fledged restaraunt.  It was a Friday night, and we got there at 6:30.  One person was eating there, and while we were there, one more guy came in and ate by himself.  So it is obviously not a busy joint as most of the stores around were empty.  I spoke to the owner and she told me, yeah, a ton of stores closed down and moved out and some were beginning to trickle back in.  So my point is, why rock the boat?  Don't you want the few customers that do come, to spread a good word??? Lastly, all of us felt a bit thirsty the rest of the night, so not sure what it was  that made us all thirsty... Jamaican version of MSG?"}
{"text":"After passing this restaurant many times and after reading all the wonderful comments on yelp, I decided to stop at that restaurant today!  I truly enjoyed my food. I had the oxtail, which was really good, along with veggies and rice with peas. The two ladies working there, are very nice as well. I was glad, that I,finally, stopped at that place to eat there.. I shall be back!!!"}
{"text":"Seven of us had lunch here yesterday.   We actually found this place by accident.  Place was definitely colorful, clean and had a good vibe.  The woman working here was super nice and helpful.  I'm somewhat familiar with Jamaican food; however, most of my lunch companions were not.  I decided to try the jerk chicken.  Sounded like a safe bet.  It was tasty, well seasoned and the chicken was very succulent.  As side dishes I had red beans and rice, mixed sautéed vegetables.  The red beans and rice were really good.  The mixed veggies were okay, maybe not the best choice for my palate.  However, between the jerk chicken and the red beans/rice there was tons to eat.  In my group a couple of us tried the oxtails and the goat.  Someone chose the whole steamed fish which she truly enjoyed.  Bottom line - everyone enjoyed their lunch.  Will I eat here again? Yes.  I would like to try the patties and the steamed fish on my next visit."}
{"text":"When I first moved out here from the East Coast, I thought I hit the jackpot when I found out about the Hot Pot.  But over time, I find this place to not be so hot anymore.  It's a hit or miss every time I go there.  Sometimes the food hits the spot and other times, I wish I didn't spend my money there.  First and foremost, it's an insult to my taste buds when I experience those off days. Out here restaurant owners can get away with serving sub par food because there is no real competition. But back east, this restaurant would have gone out of business.   As for my hubby, who had never eaten Jamaican food, his mouth waters when I mention the place.  I think whenever he does taste the real deal, he's going to be disappointed with Hot Pot.  These days, I order from there only when hubby makes me.  And I always get one plate to go.  And ditto on the not so friendly owner."}
{"text":"This is how Caribbean food should be done.  Excellent jerk chicken, perfectly cooked plantains, very good patties.  I highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty. My only issue is that they are incredibly stingy on the portions. I am not used to paying so much for West Indian food. Essentially, for $10 you get a container that's filled only -a quarter full of rice, a tiny side of coleslaw or plantain and jerk leg.   I'm from Toronto, ON.. in Toronto for $6 you get double (in all honesty, double!) the portion of what you get for $10 at this location.   Usually I end up buying two, sometimes even three meals to get full (I'm not fat or overweight I'm 6'4\" 200lbs.) They are also always out of stock for beef patties and festivals. I don't know why they are so under stocked and never learn from previous experience..   --Verdict:   *Food Taste: 4/5 *Parking: Free *Location: 2.5/5 *Staff/Service: 2/5 *Value: 1/5  ______________________ *Overall: 3/5  Pretty good tasting food but definitely not value-savvy for your money. Buyer Beware."}
{"text":"I visited Hot Pot a while back and fell in lust with ox tails. A friend and I decided to stop in for lunch. The restaurant was pretty desolate expect a customer that was ordering to go.  The interior was nice and bright.  My favorite thing was this translation picture on the wall that had typical English words translated so that you could say them as a native Jamaican. That was really cool.  The owners were pretty nice, they didn't say much but they smiled and had a friendly demeanor. They were pretty helpful as they advised my friend on the days they prepared a certain type of fish that he was interested in.  The prices were pretty average. I think they were just about right. They were fast food cheap, or big chain high. I believe our meals came out to around $11.00 bucks each.  The food...oh the food was FANTASTIC! as I stated, this was the first time that I'd eaten ox tails. They were so juicy and tender and they came in some type of sauce that had me cleaning each and every bone. The rice was a bit dry and the cabbage lacked flavour but mixed in with the sauce, I was pretty happy. The only thing I didn't luke was the meat pie. I actually tasted it because my friend insisted. It tasted like a frozen hamburger pattie, that was placed inside of something similar to a hot pocket haha.  Despite the meat pie, this place is a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall ambiance. My first time experiencing Jamaican food, and it was phenomenal! Staff was very attentive and kind."}
{"text":"We are going to have a party and wanted to have Jamaican food for the party. So we decided to check this place out and see if this was the place to use. I was really hungry so I called in the order so we can pick it up straight away. I was disappointed when they only had 1 beef patty left. When you walk in it's not a big restaurant but that's ok. When we walked straight up to the counter and the food was ready.   We got oxtail and jerk chicken. Also a beef and chicken patties. The oxtail was alright and same with the Jerk chicken. I must say it was cool but I have had better. The best part of the meals were the patties.   When I was up at the counter I asked if the ginger beer was homemade and she said yeah it's in the back. I really wanted to try the ginger beer but it clearly wasn't an option for her to walk to the back and put it in a cup for me.   The customer service needs some help. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken and oxtails  Curry chicken is really good too. They have nice size portions  Wish it was closer to me"}
{"text":"Hands down the best the Jamaican food around! I love coming here. Every first Friday of each month there is a fish fry and there is usually live music! They also serve alcohol and have yummy desert cakes! If your in search of seasonings, they also have them too. If your coming from Phoenix, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I went in and had the jerk chicken with sweet plantains. The set up of the restaurant was very nice and warm, the food was amazing. The chicken was juicy with a little spice to it. The roc was a little dry but the flavor was good. I will be back very soon to try the oxtails and the famous rum cake."}
{"text":"Very clean and welcoming.. I have never tried Jamaican food before. The Jamaican meat pie was very good. Too bad I took the last one and were no more. Weird since it was only just past noon. I ordered the ox tail which came with rice and beans and salad. The ox tail was very tender and had very good flavors and just the right amount of spice. Next time I come here I will try the jerk chicken and order 5 meat pies lol.. hopefully they have enough next time. Very nice ladies running the kitchen and register."}
{"text":"This is a local place I been wanting to try for a while now. Phoned in an order of jerk chicken and curry goat since that's what most people have given good reviews. The service was nice and friendly. When arriving, the place was quaint, clean and nicely themed for the cuisine.   The goat curry had really good flavor. However, it seemed like every other bite I chewed into a bone, and had to pick it out of my mouth. Not very pleasant. The jerk chicken was very dry and bland. The load of rice and side veggies were subpar fillers for a disappointing meal. I was really looking forward to finding a new local ethnic place. I am very surprised with the 4 and 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Yup, I got back here last trip and this one.  Last time I got the Oxtail meal--oh my, so good, and rich in flavor!  And tender!  Fall-off-the-bone-tender.  Melt-in-your-mouth-tender.  I'm drooling just remembering it.  In fact, much as I loved the Goat Curry, I got the Oxtail this trip, too, and it was as good as I remembered.  My daughter's dog will love me forever for bringing her the bones, also.    So, when are you going to open up a place in San Diego?"}
{"text":"As is the case with many hidden gems in the Valley, Hot Pot is hidden in a strip mall... it's nothing special to look at (from the outside or the inside), but when you walk in and breathe in the aroma of authentic caribbean cuisine, you know you're in for a treat.  I was actually feeling like a simple salad, something light for lunch after stopping by Gangplank last week.  Roger W and Jeff M talked me into joining them for lunch, and how could I be picky when they suggested we try Hot Pot because of their positive Yelp reviews and convenient location?  I couldn't!  So, when we walked in and saw the kind lady behind the counter in this \"zero decor\" restaurant and the menu for the day with only a few items written on a board, I sucked it up and figured \"what the hell,\" just give it a shot!  I'm happy I did!  I went with the curry chicken while Roger had a couple of veggie pockets and Jeff, the jerk chicken... It was all tasty - especially once Jeff and I added some hot sauce to ours.  I was happy to get some cabbage on the side of the chicken (and some white rice too), but I was secretly hoping they would offer a salad as well.  If you like authentic Caribbean cuisine, check out Hot Pot... don't go in with expectations for anything but the food, and expect an extremely limited menu.  If you do those things, you'll be in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since the reviews are good and it isn't too far from my house.  It was eh, just alright it my opinion.  Perhaps I have high expectations since I've been to Jamaica but my husband agreed this isn't a place we will be bringing our friends and family.    I'll start with the positives:  The restaurant is clean and the person at behind the counter was friendly.    Negatives:  The food was just okay, nothing to write home about.  I ordered jerk chicken.  The plantains were tasty but seemed like old oil they were using to fry them.  The rice and beans were again, okay, but didn't taste fresh and were barely warm.  And I had a stomach ache the next day.  Not good."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I ordered the stew chicken, cabbage and rice and peas. The portions were great size for the price. They even sold Jamaican seasonings for a great price."}
{"text":"Never had Caribbean food before and the employee working the front was very kind and helpful to figure out what to get (thankfully I showed up right before the lunch rush).   The jerk chicken was refreshingly spicy and the rice and beans were perfect to calm it down when it got too hot.   The fried plantains. Oh the fried plantains. Amazing when hot still good when cold. It's a burst of sweet but with flavor.   The inside was very relaxing with the music selection and open seating. They even had a couple super comfy chairs for those waiting for take out.   A++"}
{"text":"Me: So what did you think of this place?  Craig: Weeeell, I thought the flavor of the sauce on the jerk chicken was good. But I like to be able to tell what I'm eating, and it was hard to identify this as chicken. It seemed like random bones and meat pieces.   Me: Yeah, there were a lot of bones! I kept biting down on them. I've never had so many little bones in chicken before. It reminded me of eating fish. And in fish, it's okay, because you expect that. But those little bones were really unexpected.   Craig: How did you like the vegetables?  Me: Meh. They didn't have much flavor.   Craig: Agreed.   Me: But they're really nice people and the service was good.   Craig: Mmhmm. Mexican Coke was a plus. The music was kind of Jamaica-y. Like Reggae covers of pop songs from the 80s.   Me: I didn't even notice because I was too busy pulling bones out of my mouth and bitching about mean people. But I trust your observation on that. Anyway, it was an all right place, but not really my thing. I probably wouldn't come back.   Craig: Same. Do you need anything from Walmart while we're out?  Me: Nah, I'm good."}
{"text":"I thought the decor was cute and they played great music, place was clean and staff was friendly. I ordered the jerk chicken, pretty good and has a bite (spicy) came with white rice and vegetables."}
{"text":"Clean and bigger than I expected.  Some of these little places can be over crowded.  This place has plenty of seating.  Food was good and staff is friendly.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall but great food! So much flavor. Got the Jerk Chicken & the stewed chick! 2"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on our way to the nursery to get some plants and he saw Hot Pot Jamaican in a little strip mall. We're always looking for new places to add to our rotation so he grabbed a menu and we took it home. It took us a few weeks to get back but we finally tried it.   The restaurant is very casual and decorated with bright colors and tschotchis. There was no one in the restaurant when we waked in so  we just walked right up to the counter and ordered. They have a rotating menu of specials and then a regular menu you can order from all the time. I ordered the Jamaican shrimp curry with red beans and rice and plantains. Everything was so good! Sometimes shrimp is over cooked and rubbery - this was perfect! I love plantains and these were perfectly done and sweet but not too sweet. The red beans and rice were a perfect offset to the spicy curry. This place will be on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken , red beans and rice is amazing , cabbage is so good ! Love it , the cakes very very good , very friendly staff ! Curry chickens very good too"}
{"text":"Their Jerk Chicken is awesome with the rice and beans. Get it with the plantains and you have a great afternoon lunch or dinner. Their chicken breast is like the way my friends grandma used to make it, home cooking!"}
{"text":"Not sure how the food tastes here but the workers have major attitude.  I'd rather spend my money elsewhere where the customer service is good."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken and Oxtail were delicous. Both had just the right amount of spice and kick to it."}
{"text":"Me and the wife love this place !  Very small! We get beef patties from here and they are amazing every time !  Just wish they had cocoa bread to serve the beef patty on !  Prices fair food is amazingly prepared !"}
{"text":"This goat curry is the most delicious dish within miles.   It's, as most dishes are, a bit too salty for my tastes though.   Great music and friendly service."}
{"text":"Being going here since 2010 best Caribbean Cuisine in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place and decided to give it a chance. I don't normally pop into strip mall restaurants but since it was Caribbean food I had to give it a shot.  The Jamaican patties were tasty but not very authentic. They were out of beef so we had the chicken.  My buddy and I shared a plate of the stew chicken and rice and peas with a side of plantains.  The plantains were not bad but I've had better here in town. The stew chicken lacked a little flavor and tasted a bit bland. The rice and peas looked a little light on the peas also.  I was disappointed to see there were no real Jamaican drinks offered. I expected a little more authenticity and what I got just seemed to be a watered down version of the real Ting.  Sadly my buddy and I both didn't feel very well that afternoon. I went home a little early from work, so it didn't agree with me. I've eaten lots of Jamaican food as a kid and been there as an adult. I've never had that issue. So I would assume the stew chicken may have stewed a little too long.  I am not above trying it again. Maybe on a busier day closer to the weekend. So if your in the area it may be worth a visit. Maybe I will suggest they bring in some sodas from the islands and not Costco."}
{"text":"I may not know Caribbean food, but I know a good meal when I have it.  I am up to 4 great meals from Hot pot and I plan on having more.  I have had curry goat, curry chicken, oxtail and jerk chicken.  I loved them all.  I also really enjoy the lightly cooked cabbage on the side.  Very helpful and friendly staff.  They usually have a limited menu (to keep costs down) but usually have several meats to choose from.  I plan on trying everything on the menu.  This is just another diamond in the rough.  On top of the wonderful food, it is always good to support local."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  My husband, daughter and I enjoyed it.  My daughter had a chicken curry dish, my husband a chicken stew, and I had oxtail.  Food was very tasty.  The only reason why I'm giving it 4 star instead of 5 is because they seem to be understaffed.    We came here probably 1 1/2 months ago, and I probably should have done a review closer to then, but I'm finally getting to it.    Glad my husband was opened to trying something new."}
{"text":"Overall AWESOME food! Location is actually great for me. It's lacking on a welcoming place a bit and leaves you a bit confused when you walk up to the counter. There's no real menu but a white board with simple markings. Their food cases on the counter both times I went. So if you want a REAL 'mom and pop' experence, this is your place! They have always been very sweet and helpful! Oh did I mention the food is AWESOME! Five stars for the food, doc one for their 'curb appeal' inside."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious. I definitely recommend the curry chicken. The flavor was amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. Arizona is not know to usually have a lot of different types of cuisine. Usually it's a huge chain restaurant with mediocre food and service. Unfortunately mom n pop shops don't do so well. So when I find out that is absolutely delicious, I have to let people know and this is one of those places!  I've tried most of the dishes here but my favorite is the jerk chicken. Whatever marinade they use is so delicious and every time I come back to AZ, I have to go to this place. The people there are also very friendly. Im always greeted with a warm welcome and like to have conversations with their regulars."}
{"text":"I like this place. Got the jerk chicken with rice and beans, while my boyfriend got the goat curry, also with rice and beans. Rice and beans was the only side option available when we came in.   The jerk chicken really kicked my ass. It's spicy, which is not entirely something I am used to, but not afraid to try. The hotness, though, is more in the sauce and preparations on the skin. On working my way through it, the chicken was nice and tender.   To even out what I was sure would be a tongue-igniting meal, I got one of those empanada-like beef patties that are sold individually on the counter. It was sort of bland with a very mild flavoring from the meat and beans within the crust.   There are a few things that might concern first-time diners:   - The menu is different each day with only 4 or 5 menu items available at one time as it's all pre-made in the kitchen. You are fairly limited in this regard. While they offer several side options, only one was available during our visit.   - There are no prices posted on the menu. The goat curry with a drink grabbed from the refrigerator came out to $13. My jerk chicken plus pattie and bottle soda was over $15.   - Some menu items, like the goat curry, are heavily comprised of bones that need to be picked out. While this wasn't a deal-breaker, and you still get a good amount of meat, some might be exasperated by the mere presence of them in their food.   Overall, my experience was positive, and I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've driven by it a bunch of times and never stopped. Man, that was a mistake. Very nice staff, very clean, and the food was very good!"}
{"text":"I definitely love jerk chicken - this is my third review of a restaurant serving jerk chicken. This restaurant is actually the closest to my house - just about a mile away, but I had never been there until I located it on the Yelp mobile app.   The restaurant is located in a shopping center, right up front facing Arizona Avenue. Plenty of parking and good seating inside. They had reggae music playing and it was a comfortable environment while waiting. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the jerk chicken to go. She said they also had homemade ginger beer, so I ordered one while waiting on the food. The drink was an immediate strong hit of ginger, but settled into a nice refreshing drink.  I ate the chicken when I got home. I ordered it with a side of plantains and rice/peas. She was just baking the plantains when I ordered. Those were the first bite, and they were wonderful! the rice was good, then I went for the chicken. Wow! It was the spiciest I have ever had. Two bites in and my nose was running and I had hiccups. I loved it. It was a good portion and I ate  every bit of it.  With this restaurant just down the street and my experience with my first order. I definitely will be back. It would be nice with the spacious seating and good music to sit back with a ginger beer, relax, and eat it there next time. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for some jerk chicken and it was delish.  Great flavor and not too spicy.  The rice and peas were okay, a little dry and they were like rice and red beans not black eyed peas that I'm used to.  The cabbage salad was good.  The beef patties were amazing and big for $2.00..Also tried the cupcakes yummy. I would def come back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife and kids on a whim when we were in the area.  I thought the food was very good.  We got two orders each of curry chicken and jerk chicken.  Both were tasty and well seasoned.  The jerk was perfect for me, but way too spicy for kids or those who don't love the heat.  The curry was good, but not as tasty as curry from most Indian or Thai restaurants.  They don't have a kids menu and I'd say the next time we come we'll leave the kids at home.  It is worth another trip.  First Friday night of every month is a fish fry--I plan to check it out."}
{"text":"I recently went in and grabbed 2 beef patties and a kola champagne.    heavenly."}
{"text":"Ordered the jerk chicken 'mini' with veggies. Mediocre. $5.99. 3 small pieces of bony greasy chicken."}
{"text":"UPDATE, 7/17/2015: Still amazing. Still delicious. Still my favorite lunch spot. It's absurd how good this food is.  I can't help but laugh at how delicious and spot on this place is. I returned from eating lunch and plopped myself on the couch in my office, thinking that a quick power nap was in order after stuffing my face of Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas, and Fried Plantains so ferociously. In the midst of my post-Hot Pot dreaming where I had a chicken bone hanging out of my mouth, sand in my cheeks, and water hitting my toes, I succumbed to what I knew I needed to do: share the love on Yelp.  So now here I am, up off my couch and acting like I'm doing some work in my office but really writing a Yelp review for my new favorite lunch spot. Seriously, if you're hungry and wondering where to eat, just stop doing whatever you're doing and drive to this place and order some Jerk Chicken. The Chicken was good with huge flavor. The Rice and Peas was absolutely on point. And don't even get me started on that FRIED PLANTAIN... Great portions and a D&G Pineapple Soda was about $11 bucks before tip. The atmosphere was perfect: small seating area, close and communal, with great Caribbean music playing in the background (like...real stuff).  Everything was so good that I started to feel a little embarrassed about the noises that were unintentionally exuding from my mouth, body, and soul. At one point, I thought I was acting out Bill Murray's dinner scene from \"What About Bob?\" I actually (and I'm not joking here) caught myself going, \"Mmmm.....Mmmm....Mmmm....\" after each bite and chew.  Hot Pot: I love you. See you real soon. You were good to me and I'll be good to you."}
{"text":"The best jerk chicken I've had since the 2003 West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn.  They tone down the heat on a lot of their items so make sure and ask for the Scotch Bonnet to spice things up."}
{"text":"Caribbean food varies by island,  my biggest concern when a eating is some restaurants attempt another islands specialty  because the dish misses that foods distinction.  Ex: A Jamaican restaurant cooking Trinidadian dishes like roti.   Fortunately, Hot Pot didn't attempt this & stuck to Jamaican specialties.  Beef Pattie was tasty, the curry goat lacked flavor but the peas & rice was perfect.  The place is super clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I will tell you when I get that urge for oxtails, this place has the best east of the border lol.  The food has always been hot and the servings are good size, it will take you 2 settings to finish, but that is a good thing.  The wait is never too long and the staff is always polite, when we have went."}
{"text":"Tried them a couple weeks ago. Have been back a few times since. Can't wait till their stocked with patties again as I'm excited to try one."}
{"text":"Talk about simplicity, this place is as simple as it gets. A/C at 82 maybe, tables and chairs, and a chalkboard with a few items scribbled on it. But with food like this what else do you need?   Today I tried the Brown Chicken Stew served with rice and some sort of cabbage salad. I was skeptical when I opened my Styrofoam tray but that was put to rest with my first bite. Tender chicken, flavorful rice, and whatever that cabbage thing was.... excellent.   Maybe next time a restaurant opens up next to my dealership, I won't wait 9 months to try it out. Especially when it's this good."}
{"text":"The food here was basically a flavorless mush. My family ordered a couple servings of oxtail, jerk chicken, and stew chicken. Let me tell you, I didn't know it was possible for Caribbean food to be bland, but there you have it. The oxtail was horrendous, the smallest possible pieces I've ever seen and were COMPLETELY fat, not one bit of true beef on them. Very cheap and made me queasy to be blunt. I found that the cashier wasn't very friendly, which was a turn off. And on top of that, it does not seem like they are able to handle any sort of rush. Took over a half an hour to have food that was called 2 days ahead ( and obviously already prepared) put into pans and brought out to me. I have a feeling they are aware of that though, because they do have a help wanted sign out front. My advice is to not come here if you are in any sort of rush, or maybe call ahead if you are picking food up. I noticed a family waiting at the counter for almost 10 minutes trying to pay their bill, and a good amount of people looking annoyed waiting for their food. We won't be back. I wasn't even offered any help bringing $100 worth of burning hot food in cheap, flimsy aluminum pans to my car. My Jamaican mother could easily put this place out of business if she decided to sell her food."}
{"text":"I use to refer folks. Not any more.  I ordered ackee and saltfish.  1st time trying it. Did not like it. Called and ask if I could exchange it for my usual (ox tails and rice) or get a store credit. I was informed that if it was prepared correctly and if I did not like it it was not their fault that I did not like it and that they should not and would not allow for an exchange or store credit......I will not be returning and will no longer refer others.  Lost patron....peace"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. It is pretty flavorful and you get a nice sized serving."}
{"text":"The oxtails and jerk chicken are amazing! The cabbage was seasoned nicely and the plantains are how they are supposed to be soft and delicious! Great find as I was driving back from Chandler. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by and try a taste of the Caribbean in the desert!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and best of all like authentic Jamaican food. We're we're the last customers in before closing and the service was amazing. Our server (she) went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. I'll be going back all my days in a row bodice I have to fly back home / leave town. I have only one wish. I hope they add soup back to the menu. Not just for winter but year round. Even if just a Avis chicken soup and or red peas soup. We need it!!!"}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Chandler on a road that seems to be the main drag with lots of other businesses, fast-food restaurants and other places to eat.     Parking is a bit limited as the restaurant shares parking spaces with other businesses  in the same mini-strip mall but when we went, there was plenty of parking available.  .   The restaurant is clean and well lit though a bit on the noisy side with the reggae music (-1).  Bathroom was clean.   Menu - The menu is posted on the wall at the counter behind the cash register and is not confusing to read however one thing I didnt understand was how it showed each dish and the accompanying day that it will be served, e.g. oxtail on Wednesday's (don't quote me on that as that's just an example) so I had to ask the lady if I could still get the curry goat on Saturday which she said yes to.  Service - The staff (one lady behind the counter) was very friendly and answered any questions we had. One thing we didn't like was a couple things - out in the dining area was no access to napkins or plastic forks, knives, spoons, etc.  If you're dining in, you are provided with a couple napkins and a plastic fork but I would like the freedom of choosing what plastic utensils I'd like to eat with and also I'd like the freedom to choose extra napkins if I so desire. (-1) The second thing is, one could not bring in your own beverages to be consumed from the outside.  We brought in our own water bottles and couldn't consume it because of the sign stating this policy.  Some people do prefer to consume water rather than the beverages offered on the premises and from my recollection, I don't recall water being offered for sale. (-1)   Food - I ordered the number the curry goat with rice and beans and plantains.  When you place an order, you are offered the option of white rice or rice and beans; and vegetables or plantains.   I was a little disappointed when I saw that my plate only had 3 plantains as I was expecting a bit more. The rice and beans was very bland and dry with no moisture and lacked any kind of seasoning or salt.  I would've put some extra salt on it but the dining tables lacked salt shakers. The curry goat lacked any kind of meat and was very small in size though it was hot and spicy as it should be. (-1)  I was really hoping that this place would've been my go-to place for Caribbean food whenever the hankering hit but unfortunately I cannot recommend this place.  I have eaten at many other Caribbean establishments and sadly this place just isn't up to par with them."}
{"text":"I move from LA to the White suburbs of Gilbert, Arizona and BOOYA I find a Caribbean restaurant with curried goat and plantains! My fav since some college in Jamaica! The food is simple, reasonably priced, and spiced like the Caribbean Islands! Try it!"}
{"text":"First time eating there today thanks to my friend Mona, I met the owner Karen who was very pleasant and helpful to a first-timer. If you like spicy food I highly recommend the jerk chicken. Unbelievable taste with TONS of flavor. The sides were appetizing, the plantains were cooked just right and the rice and beans soaked up all the flavor of the jerk spice. I also recommend the hibiscus drink that they offer, refreshing with an unexpected punch at the end. I am definitely coming back and look forward to continuing to support small business."}
{"text":"Want some Caribbean food in your life and your in Arizona? look no further. Hot Pot is the place to go. I've been going there for a few years on and off and the flavors are just outstanding. This is down home cooking at it's best. The jerk chicken, Brown Stew chicken with rice/peas, plantains are amazing. The goat curry is great for you curry lovers. They also have homemade desserts which will make you feel like your eating bits of happiness in your mouth. DO IT!"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and made to order. I never had a Jamaican pattie before but the veggie ones are very delicious. The woman who answered the phone was also nice and gave off positive vibes!"}
{"text":"I decided to bump my review to 5 stars from 4. Caribbean food is an acquired taste and Hot Pot does it right. The taste is so nuanced and there is a lot of flavors going on that it can be overwhelming to distinguish what is happening. Their rice and peas (kidney beans and rice) are the best in the valley. They have the right portions of beans to rice, and it has the right amount of cook time. The meats they prepare are all cooked to perfection and are fall-off-the-bone tender. A few of the chicken dishes come with potatoes and fresh thyme which helps to give it a kick and authentic island taste. If you like plantains then you will love them here: generous portion size of them and they are so sweet it should be illegal. The staff is friendly and welcoming, the space is colorful, and the food is amazing: what else could you ask for?   OG Review: If you want Caribbean food this is the place. The curry is rich and usually comes with fresh thyme. The plantains are done to perfection and the sides are all delicious."}
{"text":"Before yesterday I may have been inclined to give more stars, but I felt like I got robbed!! I used to come here all the time for 2 large to go plates of rice and peas and cabbage (no meat). I've always expected to pay around $20. It's a lot, but I don't do this often and their food is actually good. A few visits ago I got the same items and the clerk charged me $15. Okay. Fine..less money, good to go. By the way, the $15 was a different lady, the one who charged me $20 was a quiet little girl with the personality of a stone. Anyway, yesterday I placed a take out order. 2 orders of rice and peas and 2 orders of callaloo, basically the same thing I have always been ordering rice and vegetables (no meat) no goat, chix,ox tail..nothing....$28 dollars!!! I looked at the girl (same quiet girl who charged me 20 all the time) and asked if this was the usual price? She said something incomprehensible. I reluctantly paid! Man, I was salty, but I was hungry! Then I asked for 2 sides of the jerk sauce they usually throw in (I thought) and she charged me a dollar...WTF!!!! I'm gonna have to find a way to make this at home, cause this will be the last time I go to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"After reading positive reviews- I decided to try out \"Hot Pot\" with my husband...VERY good  homemade caribbean food!   The service was  fast , friendly, and great - and the food was filling and tasty. We had:  - Curry Goat w/ white rice = very good and plenty of flavor! - Oxtails w/ rice and beans =  YUMMY and fall off the bone tender!  - Spinach and cheese pastry = DELICIOUS!!!  - Chocolate rum cake = WOW! super moist and full of flavor in every bite!!!  ** DEFINATELY worth trying!!! **"}
{"text":"Trying Something New Stepping Out Of My Zone Trying A New Place Ordered 2 Jamaican jerk plates with rice and peas,veggie, and plantains.  Closed at 9 came at 7:30 no patties available  yet she was kind enough  to sell me 4 beef patties and instructed me on how to heat in oven therefore  I dont have to come back tommrow since they sale out fast.  Ill update photos of food once  I get home ."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken, beans, and rice meal. It was sooo good and spicy in the best way! If you don't like spicy food, you probably shouldn't order it. However, I love it. I ate all of it with great joy hahaha. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like Hot Pot. I am a curry goat fanatic, I would eat it every day for every meal. I would climb to the highest mountain top and loudly proclaim my love of goats and what they become once they're curried. I got my first and only review of the day for reviewing my favorite Jamaican spot's curry goat - I love curry goat. Alternatively what I hate is bad customer service and that's what Hot Pot has. I'm not new to this, I'm Caribbean, I get it, some of us have attitudes. At my spot back in NY (Little Jamaica) the ladies aren't too friendly either but they are courteous and they at least greet you upon entering. Not at Hot Pot. I walked in to small tables filled with people and instantly felt like I should have turned around and walked out. Not a \"hello\", not a \"hi\", not a \"be right with you\" but all eyes were on me. I walked my way to the front and waiting about five minutes to be greeted. And guess who greeted me? One of the women that was sitting at the table. So, this is your job and instead of tending to customers you're having a chat? Okay. And I don't mind that but once a customer walks in, it's time to take care of that customer or at least acknowledge their presence. She then proceeded to charge me $11.99 when I asked for a small curry goat meal. I intentionally asked for a small because I wasn't sure if I'd like the way the cooked the goat. When the other woman behind the counter went to hand me my food, the woman who initially helped me automatically cut her off and said, \"that's not her food, she ordered a small.\" Before I could chime in the woman pointed out that she charged me $11.99 which is the price of a large. Apparently the woman got confused then tried to refund me my money but I just took the large but not before telling her that I was taken aback by the prices but since I'm Caribbean too and new to Arizona I had no problems paying, I just thought the price was really high. She commented something about not trying to rip me off but whatever. Now onto the food - had I never had curry goat from Little Jamaica I probably would have really liked Hot Pot's food but that's not the case. Their curry goat and their cabbage, just their seasonings overall weren't what I was used to but it was still good, just not as good. I can't see myself giving Hot Pot another chance being that they aren't the only restaurant in Arizona that serves curry goat but you never know."}
{"text":"The place: Non-descript strip mall location (why do all little ethnic places seem to occupy these out of the way locations?).  The inside is basically a few tables and a counter.  If I recall there was a TV on the wall?  The food: I tried the fantastic goat curry and was very pleased with the flavor and quantity.  As the side I ordered the fried plantains which were also quite good.  The \"spicy\" rice was a little salty but good to soak up the curry sauce.  The bottom line: I would highly recommend the place if you'd like a taste of the Caribbean."}
{"text":"The food and flavor a are awesome. I'm from Toronto Canada originally which makes this place a gem find so far from home."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. I wanted to give them 5 stars for the coconut rum cake alone! But, when they said they didn't have what I wanted Jerk chicken I had to lower the score. The oxtails were delicious, and the portion size was large. The red beans and rice were tasty and their cabbage was nice and moist ( I hate dry Jamaican cabbage) over all I will return, if for nothing else the rich moist coconut rum cake."}
{"text":"Being from NYC I grew up on great Caribbean food and I'm really happy I can get it here in Chandler where I live now. Highly recommended because they are very friendly and great prices. There is always room to park and you'll be chowing down on your spicy food within minutes. Check it out if you are nearby!"}
{"text":"Do you like emapanadas, samosas, pastiles?  Gots to try the beef pies here!  Lunch today: jerk chicken, plantains and beef pies. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much at first. It's often empty, the service is aloof, the decor is lacking, etc.   But none of that matters because the food is so absolutely delicious.    If I ever find myself on death row, I suspect that my last meal request would be a bag of beef pies from Hot Pot.  Highly recommended.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"So far I have eaten there for lunch twice.  Had the oxtail the first time and goat curry and meat pie the second.  I was not disappointed in fact impressed.  Tender and full of flavor and just enjoyable.  I also recommend ordering their festival (I didn't see it on the menu). A Jamaican hush puppy is how I would describe it.  There are very limited choices (about 4-5 items per day) so not a place for picky eaters but I sure have found a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Don't eat here, warmed over leftover food being sold. Take a look into their kitchen."}
