{"text":"Love it! Never one problem! But I'm laughing because he said he would rather eat famous daves! He doesn't know know real BBQ,! A fried hotdog! lol 
Can't please everyone but I'm happy that's my favorite! Polish Boy!"}
{"text":"freddie's gets five on the strength of one thing - the polish boy.

we came for the polish boy (after reading about it in esquire's best sandwiches 2008 piece) and we will come back for the polish boy.  did we enjoy other items on the menu?  sure.  but the polish boy is truly special.

want me to tell you what it is?  okay, fine.

the polish boy is a thick, juicy kielbasa grilled on the flat, tossed in a big,  soft bun and then topped with crisp french fries, creamy cole slaw and sweet barbeque sauce.  i'm about to snap my laptop in half just thinking about the fact that no one has bound my wrists and ankles and shoved one of these down my neck today.

look, i know you wanna cock an eyebrow at that description.  i know i did while reading it after the beachland ballroom ripped our souls out when we went there and they told us that the accalimed trailer park monte cristo was no longer on the menu (not to mention looking at us like we were insane for asking).  

but listen, this thing is just a spectacular blend of top notch individual elements brought together to create a super sandwich.  it's strange, because you might find most of these elements at a potluck, maybe even on the same plate, but never together in the same sandwich - that is until freddie's decided to create 'potluck voltron'.

in fact, i've decided that's what it should be called instead.  potluck voltron.  problem is if you go to freddie's and ask for a potluck voltron they will not give you what you're looking for.  and you NEED to have one of these.  so, i guess we'll just keep calling it the polish boy.

one more thing - if you're big on ambiance, not the place.  don't expect it to be.  however, if you're looking for a truly delicious experience in a dirty closet, this is the place."}
{"text":"No fuss here. This is about the food. Half slab of beef ribs, a dozen fried wings with sauce, and two orders of fried okra were just enough for the 4 of us. The sauce was sweet, the ribs and wings were nice and tender, and the okra was as good as my dear departed grandma used to make. No plates, use the paper towels. Plastic forks are fine. The only diet drink is bottled water.  BET network TV on the tube. I love them!"}
{"text":"This place receives my vote for Best Value BBQ joint.  I ordered the Sunday special of Rib Tips and Fries.  Holy smokes...for $4 it was the largest pile of food I've seen in a while.  But it's NOT pulled pork..it's tips.  They can be fatty so watch out.  Not to be missed is the macaroni and cheese. Probably THE BEST RESTAURANT MACARONI & CHEESE I HAVE EVER HAD.  And I am one tough customer.  The half slab of ribs fell right off the bone but had bone fragments so watch your teeth.  Cole slaw was okay (slightly watery).  Wings had a nice layer of fried goodness on them and come slathered in BBQ sauce.  French fries are killer good.  Their BBQ sauce tastes more like a combination of BBQ sauce and sweet n sour sauce.  It is not a smoky sauce at all.  It has a little kick but it's also a little sweet.  Freddie's is mostly a takeout place but we chose to sit there and watch some March Madness on the TV.  The owner gave us two complimentary cans of iced tea which was really cool.  He checked in on us multiple times to see if everything was okay.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I was in town and staying at the Double Tree. I was looking for something close and Freddie's was the option. 
Like the other reviews, this place is a hidden gem. I did not get the polish boy; however, the half ribs was great it included some cold slaw and sweet potato fries. Definitely worth the 12$... it seems like there lunch specials are the greatest value. 
I would also like to thank the guy that helped me choose my dinner."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying i am being honest and this is off my experience with place. TERRIBLE...The food is decent but the professional customer experience is horrible..I placed an order from our company to this place for a delivery at around 12:30pm we did not receive our food till 2:30pm, this is not because the order was large it was because the delivery person just moved slow. when we called in to complain he offered a $1 off of our order. This to me is unheard of and i will never order from here again and if we do it will be pick up only. I would have expected them to do a lot better of a job due to the place they delivered is a large company with tons of people and we always order out for lunch but from here...never again..they have lost a company worth of customers..."}
{"text":"I am actually from the south so I do know what real BBQ is. I really wanted to like this but sadly I wasn't. I do wish them luck. I just think that if your making BBQ then it should be cooked in a smoker or on a open pit. to many places cook ribs like pizza joints and that's to sad. ribs are not supposed to be cooked only in a oven. also famous Daves has won hundreds of BBQ contests around the country including the cleveland rib cook off twice."}
{"text":"Outstanding takeout place.  Cash only which is worthy of mention.  I was at a convenience store down the street, and the owner offered me a free polish boy.  I declined but returned later that day.

Just know what it is which is not a sit down restaurant.  It is a take out place.  BBQ sauce is awesome.   Sausage was outstandingly cooked.  I hope it says open, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love places like Freddie's.
Great food... and without the power of the interweb... you'd never know.
It's a must-try for wing lovers.
The wings come whole. Drums, wings and wing tips = one wing. Keep that in mind when ordering. And don't be scared if you've never had wings this way.
They're crispy with an original sauce full of a tangy, sweet flavor.
The Polish Boy is killer. It's a kielbasa in a thick bun, covered in cole slaw, french fries and BBQ sauce. It's cooked perfectly and requires a fork.
Ask Esquire magazine... They put it on a list of \"Best Sandwiches in America\".
Oh, and order to-go. Frankly, this place is a hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"I was just a barbecue lovin', rock lovin' tourist in town to see the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame.  Went to Freddie's on a tip from the Concierge at the DoubleTree Hotel (a very convenient place to stay if you are here for the Museum).
We arrived at this wonderful, family run hole in the wall, famished after a geat five hour rock-n-roll binge.  We got there 10 minutes before closing, and there was no one else in the place.  The owner was very gracious, and served up our chicken wing dinner, our full slab of pork ribs, and our sides of greens and fries, all of which were finger-licking good ya'll.  
The chicken wings were crispy southern fried wings, not the buffalo style, and that was alright by me, because my wife moaned with each bite, and that always pleases me.
The ribs were succulent and covered with a very tasty, very sweet sauce.  I'm not a sweet sauce guy, but this stuff certainly did the job.  Some hot sauce on the table would have rectified that situation.
The basket of sliced white bread made the experience all the more authentic.
Fine dining it is not.  What we have here is true southern BBQ, cooked with soul and love."}
{"text":"Oh, yeah.  To quote the last (and first) reviewer, \"If you have not been to Freddie's yet, you messed up.\"

You just can't leave Cleveland without getting a Polish Boy (Kielbasa, fries, cole slaw, BBQ sauce, all on the sandwich) and you should do it here because Freddie's sauce is sweetly exquisite.  Plus you gotta see the \"Wing Menu\" on the wall, which lists prices by quantity ordered of wings, down to ONE WING.  It would appear to be inspired by Chris Rock's bravura performance in \"Im'a Get You Sucka\".

By the way, they seem to be making efforts to clean up the place.  The walls are now painted yuppie mandarin orange."}
{"text":"If you have not been to Freddie's yet, you messed up. This place is unreal. It looks like a dirty garage when inside. Most people will be turned off by the interior or even the outside of the building. It is probably about the same as food warehouses in America. There is no such thing as \"clean\", this is Planet Earth. Get over yourself. You are a filthy inhabitant of this planet no different than a cockroach. If you think this place is a hole, you are right. This whole universe is a hole. So eat at Freddie's and get an authentic Cleveland made Polish Boy! The guy who works there is really nice."}
