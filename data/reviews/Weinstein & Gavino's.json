{"text":"My husband and I have been going there for years, and it's always perfect. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and if you feel like something that is no longer on the menu, they'll cook it up for you. Great ambiance, bar, date or in a group."}
{"text":"what a great place. visiting from Pennsylvania and what great food and hospitality. we went with a group of 6 for my gf's sister 21st birthday. Nick the manager was just great and so polite. what a great place and atmosphere. the service was so quick food was delicious. especially on a Saturday. 100% recommended."}
{"text":"I was in a hury and ordered a sandwich to go. Saltiest sandwich I ever ate. Had to throw it away and order something on the plane. I ate the same sandwich before and I did not have a problem."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars based on their pasta alone! It was to die for. Coming from Newfoundland where there is very limited fresh pasta options, we were dying over how good the food was. My fianc√© had the carbonara & I had the romanoff with papardelle, both were fantastic. The complimentary bread with pesto was also tasty, and my apricot sour was a perfect balance of sweet & tart. We sat outside in the terrase area and our server was lovely & made some helpful suggestions. We will definitely return on our next trip to Mtl."}
{"text":"Through US Customs at US departures Gate 79, this is a \"don't miss.\" I travel a lot in the US and Canada and this is the best to-go place I''ve had in any airport. Highly recommend the egg biscuit breakfast sandwich. It is amazing. Last time here, the roast beef sandwich was also amazing."}
{"text":"Always had a great experience with their risottos! The complimentary bread served with pesto is warm, crispy and delicious! They have 4-8pm happy hour during the week on house wine, bar rail and some beers- my only regret is that it is only available at the bar and in the summer the terrace is much more appealing!"}
{"text":"Left me feeling reasonably full and not ripped off. High praise for a sandwich/pizza bar in an airport. I highly suggest getting a sandwich and having it warmed up...I suspect the heating bumped this place up a full star. Ended up around 15 CAD for a sandwich and a drink."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious quick breakfast! I was confused what an Italian restaurant in Montreal had to do with breakfast, however I tried it & concluded that their croissants, English muffins & chocolatines are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Love this place- so glad we decided to stop by. The waiter was extremely nice, and new the menu well. The food was delicious! I could have gone there just for the bread and pesto dip we got before our meal. The atmosphere is great, very authentic and lots to see. You could go there in formal attire or casual like we did. They have a pretty big bar if you wanted to just go for drinks. I'd definition go back there!"}
{"text":"Not of good quality - pizza was a packet pizza heated for 60 seconds and not even offered to cut into portions. Service also lacking! This is purely for convenience if you're running late to the airport."}
{"text":"My soup was microwaved in a coffee pot and the chicken perm wasn't even that good or whatever. It was all covered in like sauce or something? Fucking booo. The cheesecake was just a bunch of white goo formed into a thick layer on top of crumbled crackers. They also don't take Canadian Tire money which reeks of elite bullshit. Not in Trump's America hippy. Worst Mexican food ever."}
{"text":"It's in the middle of a short strip of great places to get a quick take-away meal in the airport.  Options like this usually make me stress, especially since all the little stands looked exactly the same.  There's a sushi one, a bagel bar, all mini-versions of some restaurants in the Montreal area.

This one's unique for its pizza offerings, but I got the grilled veggie sandwich.  It was on a crunchy, crispy ciabatta loaf, with some provolone cheese.  It had peppers, asparagus, and tomato on it, as well as an amazing pesto spread I wasn't expecting.  They heated it up and put it in an adorable little white box.  It was trendier than I was.

Best of all? It wasn't even impossible, at all, to eat on the plane!

Minus a star for the blaise attitude of the cashier when I was standing in line for 20 minutes... They had four people making egg salad croissant sandwiches, and one guy taking orders, and this woman and her annoying prepubescent daughter were arguing about chocolate milk in front of me and the daughter was imitating Gollum from Lord of the Rings and I barely made it back to my flight in time... But I did. And I had pesto-y asparagus.  My precious."}
{"text":"Great resto-bar at the center of downtown. The personnel will make you keep coming back for more. The menu is larger than what I'm normally use too. However there few disappointments as its constantly being updated.

The staff is warm and hospitable. Which makes the night a pleasure for anyone. Go to the bar and be treated by the barmaids who are very easy on the eyes. Or be seated at a table and view the hard working staff. 

I been going here for some time now with a dear friend. I don't see that changing anytime soon."}
{"text":"Airport food. It's often been used as a insult, hasn't it? Well, let me tell you, there is nothing to insult about Weinstein & Gavino's. When I saw their display case I stopped dead in my tracks. How could I not? These are some scrumptious sandwiches!

The choices are vast, including a veggie option that contained more than just the standard lettuce, tomato and cucumber. It almost won me over, but at the end of day, my heart belongs to ham and cheese.

One thing that did surprise me was that my sandwich was heated. It's not stated anywhere that this will happen, and as such I wasn't expecting it and was slightly put off for a moment. I was already feeling a little overheated from being on a plane, and had been looking to a cold refreshing meal. Then I opened the box and inhaled the amazing scent of melting cheese and juicy ham and decided not to judge too quickly. 

This sandwich was one of the best I have ever eaten. From an airport! Are you serious? It just goes to show that you never know where you might find great food. Sadly, there was one giant flaw for me that kicked a star off this rating. No mustard? No option for mustard? Nope. Had this sandwich been cold, this would have been dry as a bone as it had no sauce of any kind. 

I should start traveling with a bottle. Mustard Emergencies are all too real."}
{"text":"Pizza was a-ok and moderate beer selection. Nothing mind blowing, but they do accommodate large groups very well."}
{"text":"This may seriously be the best Airport food at YUL transborder. 

The name reminds me of Dean and Delucas in SOHO and the food is similar style

I dropped by and was questioning myself....should I eat a smoked meat at the kiosk close by? Hmmmm...no.....grossly over priced sushi down the hall? Mmmmm. No! Okay then I'll try W & G's. I ended up choosing a healthy size piece of tomato, spinach with light garlic and it was fantastic! A bit on the soggy side ( all those fresh vegetables will sure do it) but devishly good!  The attendant cut the slice into 4 small pieces and it was perfect. 

They do have sandwiches and other pizza to choose from. All looks like gourmet food!

Service was pleasant and polite. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is great taking friends and family. Food is good , lots of space and staff is very good."}
{"text":"I had an early flight out so did not eat breakfast until I got to the airport. Unlike SFO, which did not have a lot of restaurants after you crossed security, there's actually a few places to eat inside the terminal. 

I chose W&G because I didn't want any more continental breakfasts. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and it was good!  They heat it up for you and it came out hot. 

Service was quick. A great place to eat before you board!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant , nice decor , great service , decently prized. We all had pasta some of us Alfredo some of us roze sauce  none of us liked the sauce it was not  good  had absoulutly no taste it was very light it felt like someone added water in the sauce ( iam sure that's not the case) pastas were cooked al dente perfectly but like I said none of us were happy with the taste of the sauce they should make the sauce more richer more thicker and add some taste."}
{"text":"it's funny how the airport counter has a better yelp rating than the sit down one downtown.  the one downtown is deafening.  whomever designed the acoustics must be going deaf.  the kind of unce-unce eatery where you don't have much to say to each other since you can't hear them anyway. 

thankfully, this is not the issue here.  known for their pizzas, they have other items that were quite appealing.  it was still early and i opted for a buttery croissant with ham and cheese.  the coffee was flavorful and tasty.  had i not gone for brekkie, the sandwiches looked divine.  something i would have ordered if walking around town and not the crappie turkey ones with wilted lettuce that has an expiration date of \" best before...\" 

take it to go or eat it at the table seating nearby before you jet off.

i didn't get the meh attitude allison m. did.  my server was quite nice and patient.  the employees that day seemed on point even when the manager was doing a drive by."}
