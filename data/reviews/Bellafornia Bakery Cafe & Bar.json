{"text":"Fast and friendly service with great food and fair prices.  Parking is an issue at time but mostly ok.  Great atmosphere for morning coffee or small meetings ."}
{"text":"Nice variety of food in an inviting place.  I stumbled upon this cafe exploring the plaza. Hope they expand.  I appreciate that it's good for kids too."}
{"text":"Croissants, sandwiches, hot meals, coffee, soups and salads this place got lots of choices. All the servers are friendly and smiley. They have quite a few tables and chairs so you can sit and enjoy your meal. Special offer for Canada 150."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey club sandwich. Very disappointed. Only came with 2 slices of deli turkey and whatever veggie toppings you like. This is not a club sandwich. May as well just go to the subway next door for a cheaper better sandwich. Way over priced for what you get. They need to learn the meaning of the sandwichs on the menu. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time going to this cafe and I must say one of the best service and foods I've ever received. From the interior design to staffs as well the food, everything was perfect. Friendly staff with professional manner which excel in customer satisfaction. I only sat there for 5 minute and my breakfast and freshly squized orange juice was prepared and served. Most of all the price is very decent for what you order. 

I will give this cafe 5 star and will definitely come back to try the rest of the foods on their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent food and service. Mr. Ghadimi is a fantastic manager. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in North York, excellent food and service, nice ambiance! One of the very few places that stays open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great little spot with fresh items daily. Would definitely suggest stopping in if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing place for a quick meeting with friends over an amazing specialty coffee, tea, or alcoholic beverage. It is also perfect for a quick lunch or dinner! Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Newly opened bakery and bar that's New to the plaza. Whether you're here for fresh baked goods, fresh sandwiches bar fare or drinks this place has it all.
The layout of the place is quite chic with an open concept.
They've got a live dj spinning music every Friday and Saturday nights.
What mainly appealed to me was their $5 bar special drinks: mojitos, margaritas and awesome Cosmos the lovely bartender mixed for me. Jen souzed up on the mojitos and their  decadent cheese Danish as I indulged in their double chocolate croissant and cosmopolitan.

I'll definitely have to be back for food."}
{"text":"A great addition to the area! 

They have a bit of everything, and they have a menu that everybody will find something they would like - be it breakfast, sandwiches, salads, pizza, pastries, desert, etc. 

The decor is also super cute and looks like a friendly neighbourhood coffee shop.

Although service can be a little bit disorganized and slow, but the super friendly and awesome staff totally make up for it."}
{"text":"New business in a plaza that was desperately in need of a proper sit-down cafe. The other ones in the area were just not cutting it. Despite my anticipation of their opening, this business still has growing pains. The staff is slightly disorganized, but their friendliness and customer service makes up for the wait of being served. 

The sweets here are good and I had their tuna melt sandwich which was melt-in-your-mouth. The drinks are decent as well and I have heard from family members that the persian food here is divine. 

I just have a bit of an issue with the theme of this business. Is it a cafe, is it a bar, is it a persian restaurant, a sandwich shop, a boulangerie or a sweets shop? It seems this business wants to do a bit of everything, but often with that concept, food options get confusing, food quality lacks, and the atmosphere gets skewed. A better and clear focus of their business concept is needed. I hope to see this place succeed. Will return again."}
{"text":"We went to the Bellafornia Bakery Cafe. It is a new place and nicely decorated.

The servers were very friendly, but disorganized. Ordering anything was a big pain. I ordered a coffee, tea and a smoothie. The smoothie was half price for only 2 dollars.

Would I go back? Maybe. There isn't any other cafe in the other area."}
{"text":"The food was great so far! Everyone is so friendly and the atmosphere is nice. It's got everything; a place to study or read with a cup of coffee and a pastry, a bar to grab a drink, a place to have breakfast, lunch or dinner, or to pick up bread on your way home (especially because I live just above the place). My best friend, my boyfriend and I loved it. We got the butternut squash soup and rice with chicken and salad, and later got pastries. ALL delish! And they always give you samples of the most delicious breads! Looks like my diet is out the window ;) Great work!"}
{"text":"The owner was nice and kind, he welcome all customers . The ambiance was great. Persian music. Good quality food but: 

 it took 40 min to have meal. Our waitress was unprofessional and rude. The people who worked in kitchen were not synced with waiters and waitresses. 

We saw the waiters laughing and chatting with their colleagues however we were waiting for food for a while. 

Waiters were not efficient at all, first they brought food, then came back after few min for spoon, then after while came back and asked if we need anything."}
