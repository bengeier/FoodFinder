{"text":"Despite being a somewhat regular that tips 15-20% and frequently order special dishes/seafood, the customer service sucks!  The only reason I visit is because: - easy to get a table (because it's more expensive than others) - truffle/foie gras dumplings - modern interior  Casa Imperial is a better alternative (if you don't care for truffle/foie gras) but it's hard to get a last minute table!"}
{"text":"When we went to this restaurant, we had expected it to be great.  The wait was short and the food was decent, but the service was absolutely horrible.  The waitress we had was incredibly rude, and made it feel like we had to very wealthy to be able to eat there.  The menu did not list prices, so we asked for the price list, but the waitress scoffed and didn't bother to answer us and walked away.  The washrooms were very small and disgusting- I would not go to this place again."}
{"text":"Dim sum ok but dinner is bad. We ordered a set dinner for 10 people ($598) and supposed to have a 6 lbs lobster, King crab along with some other dishes. However the lobster came out was very small. Guess it was less than 4 lbs. The King Crab was again very small too. Seems like they just gave you half portion. Very disappointed. Feels like they are cheating."}
{"text":"One of the best Dim Sum experiences I have ever had! The quality of the food was tremendous and the taste was excellent. I took some friends for their \"first\" Dim Sum meal and they really enjoyed it. Definitely pricier than your average Dim Sum joint, but the food was anything but average."}
{"text":"I think I am pretty fair and I let a lot of things slide.  However, when a restaurant fails to provide even moderately good customer service, no matter how good the food is, there is no reason to return.  It's not like there aren't any other good chinese restaurants in town.    There is a lot of competition in the restaurant industry. Food is only one aspect of the dining experience.  If you provide bad customer service, it just ruins the dining experience.    That is what happened to us at Yangs.  We ordered a dish that we had ordered multiple times.  When the dish came out, it was different from the 3 previous times we had ordered it.  We inquired, but the manager essentially accused us of making it up.  He was combative and non-conciliatory.    I just fail to see why any restaurant would alienate a customer for a 18 dollar tofu dish that probably costed them $2.50 to make.  Just acknowledge that there was either a) a mistake or b) the dish changed.  That's all you have to do.     Why escalate a dispute over 18 bucks?  Is 18 bucks that important to you that you would risk losing a customer?  If you were nice about it, we would probably have accepted the dish and everything would be fine.  But... nope.    I guess the 18 bucks is too important for the manager at Yang's.  I hope that 18 bucks was worth it because we're never coming again."}
{"text":"Go here almost every weekend. Best dim sum in TO. Staff knows you by name and gives you tea discount if you are frequent customer. Very clean environment. must try dim sum: beef rice roll, shrimp ha gow, fried taro cake. Very good tea. Delicious. Only had dinner here once and it was indeed pricy. You get what you paid for."}
{"text":"We came for CNY dinner - food was not impressive yet it was sure $$$$$.  Made reservation, but they claim it was 'lost'.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Good dimsum with good vegetarian options and tasty noodle soup options.  We had a fish noodle soup and a vegetarian noodle soup, both done excellent. On the pricey side though."}
{"text":"We decided to have a special birthday dinner at this restaurant because we felt that the dim sum was quite good.  At the time of the reservation, it was confirmed that the tables will be in one of the private rooms, the menu we wanted & price was communicated to the restaurant.  I called to re-confirm before the day of the party and was told that there was a minimal spent of $500 per table in order to be in the room.  It was truly a disappointment since we had booked weeks ago and communicated to everyone at the party.  After further consideration, we cancelled our reservation because they do not deserve our business although we had to find another restaurant last minute and communicate the changes to the attendees."}
{"text":"I am giving  a 2 star due to the customer service I got from all the staffs last night. First of all, my sister made a reservation under her last name for a party of 6 at 7:45. I arrived at 7:20 and they couldn't find our reservation order. since I was waiting for the rest of the family, I casually checked out on the menu ( which is a few sheets of paper).Once I started to glance through it, 3 different hostess came over (separately) to \"sell\" the alaska king crab. One of them said\" every single table is ordering that, you don't even have to think it over\".It was very \"hard selling\" and I just hate it. It looks like they want to get rid of their overstocked king crab as they look ike \"dying\" inside the tank I ordered the tea but it took more than 10 mins to come.My sister ordered lobster of a certain size( they charges by the lbs) but they came back and said \"its 1 lb more as this is the smallest one we have\". My sis said they always do that, so the customer will end up paying more. Considering they called themselves a \"FINE\" dinning restaurant, the staffs have NO customer services. The hostess walked pass my chair and bumped into it more than 10 times the whole evening. When they served the food, they expect the customer to HELP out.We finished all the food on the table and was waiting for the last dish to be served and after waiting for another 20 mins, we decide to ask them and they said \"I thought it all came\" and they have to cook it right away without  an apology. I don't mind paying for the food even if it is over priced or not, but coming to a place with customer service that really sucks, I rather go somewhere else. There is more than 1 \"FINE\" chinese restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"Eeeekk! This place is not that amazing. The food is ok,  but like I've had better.  I would've like it more if they didn't charge us $6 for \"tea\" which wasn't even tea, it was a pot of hot water. HOT WATER. FOR 6 DOOOOLLARRRSS!   So we sat down, and like 3 waiters swarmed us asking what tea we want. We did not want any tea, we said no tea. Instead we ordered 2 iced-tea pop. Along with our pop, came a pot of hot water. We thought, ok suree if they want to warm our table with this hot water, then whateverrrr. UNTIL THE BILL CAME AND 6 BUCKS was charged for this pot of hot water, except on the bill it said \"tea\". We asked the waitress, she confirmed that it referred to this pot of water. Eventho it did not have tea. LIARS. UGH."}
{"text":"Overall Rating: 4.0 stars  Food: The food here was pretty reasonable. It wasn't overly salty or greasy. I tried my usual dim sum fare, which included:  - Har cheung/shrimp rolls - Steamed BBQ buns - nice abalone sauce, soft bun - Chicken feet - average and on par with other dim sum - Spare ribs - nice flavour not too salty - Korean short ribs - not too chewy, or salty. Nice flavour and texture - Deep fried bean curd with shrimp - nice crispy skin, fresh and tasty - Snowpea leaf shoots with garlic (off menu request) - piled high, not the best I've had, but reasonable for my veggie needs  Service: Good service. I was seated quickly and my needs were addressed promptly. No issues with this.   Parking: On a weekday afternoon at peak dim sum hours I was able to find parking in the plaza smoothly.   Overall impression: My bill for two people, albeit with a large smattering of food, was 96 dollars after tax. This price is on par with the high end dim sum places I've tried. I wouldn't say their quality matches the highest end, but you won't be disappointed either and the food is not poor quality at all."}
{"text":"Visits: 10+ (Dim Sum, Dinner & Takeout)   When the service & food is Top Notch, I never mind paying the price. In my opinion this restaurant is the perfect size for the type of restaurant and location. This will provided the needed turn over to produce the profit, which in turn stay open with compromised quality of food and service.   I enjoy my Shark Fin, Abalone & Geo-Duck as much as the next Asian, but what I truly enjoy is taking the simple ingredients and making them extraordinary.   This is another Chinese restaurant where I'm not gulping down 10 litres of water because they load up on the MSG.   Dim Sum, I've gone the most. Never disappointed me so far. They have the common Chinese items and a few that involve special ingredients such as fois gras & truffles which continues on into their dinner menu. The deep fried items were perfectly done without the transparent doily that you're used to seeing. lol   Personal Recommendations for dinner:   1. Salt baked Free range chicken  2. Crispy Pork neck meat with King Mushroom   Keeping it Simple & Fresh"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fancier twist on your typical dim sum, this is the place to go! They have a a lot of unique menu items so definitely try to focus on those -- the standard items, ie rice rolls, chive dumplings or beef balls are pretty standard and are not necessarily worth the price.  My favourite dish was the foie gras har gow, which is priced at $9.80 for 5 pieces. The har gow skin and the shrimp itself was a good balance for the richness of the foie gras. Would definitely order this again!! We also ordered the fried sticky rice. I was expecting this to be like other restaurants where you have a deep fried zong zi but this was actually sticky rice with a thin layer of omelette on top! It wasn't too heavy and I thought they went well together.   They also have a black truffle scallop and shrimp dumpling and a durian puff that I am interested to try. I don't even like durian but the presentation and the number of other tables which ordered this item makes me want to try it!   Overall I had a good experience. The food was good, there was no line despite arriving at noon on Sunday and service was relatively prompt. Definitely will be back to try their other menu items despite their higher prices."}
{"text":"The rating I give this restaurant is a bit skewed as a result of the type of dinner that I experienced.  It's probably similar to Herman's in that we had all the finest delicacies of Cantonese cuisine.  We started off with a large bowl of shark fin soup and then progressed to abalone, where each of us had one to ourselves.  I don't think I've ever seen a whole abalone as most of the time, I've eaten it when it's sliced.  Then a white fish (not sure which one as I didn't ask) with dried tofu, large shrimps in an egg glaze, and braised chicken.  We then finished it off with red bean soup and small gelatinous sweets.  One of the best dinners I've had in a long time.  Other things to note is that this restaurant has private rooms, and we were in one of them.  So private dinner service with attentive staff.  It helped that my wife's uncle knows the owner and most of the staff.  Despite that, I would still go to this restaurant on my own and I think the other reviewers agree mostly agree with me on this."}
{"text":"only been for the dim sum. generally good stuff. small place so easy to get service. do wish the har gow skins wasn't so thick and sticky though"}
{"text":"horrible horrible customer service.  I know it's Canada Day; and they're busy and packed but being RUDE is unacceptable especially the HOSTESS. First, she had no telephone manner when we called and made reservation, Then when we arrived, she was SUPER MEAN; rush us to order and tell us to leave as soon as we are done!  I wanted to give her dim sum 101 lecture; coming to enjoy dim sum with family; not only for food, it's also time to catch up with others; people take their time & chit chat!! What's her matter!!! Dim sum place is everywhere!  We are done with Yang's."}
{"text":"I came to Yang's on a Friday evening for dinner.  Disclaimer: although I'm Chinese myself, I don't often go out for Chinese food, especially at upper middle tier type restaurants.  Seafood congee this isn't.  The décor at Yang's was modern and I didn't notice the hokey Chinese pieces that are prevalent at a lot of places.  It almost felt looked like a western restaurant.  Unfortunately, it still felt like a Chinese restaurant in some respects.  The main dining room itself is not large, and also cubed shaped.  Conversation bounces easily off the walls, making the room loud despite not being full.  The room is very clean.  Service was attentive and quick.  Some parts of the menu were written only in Chinese.    We settled on the set meal with four dishes.  The soup was a fish maw soup.  Like shark's fin soup, I just never \"got\" this dish.  To me, it's a sticky, bland-ish soup but people in the older generation love it.  Same thing happened here, so I guess it was a well prepared soup that just didn't jive with me.    The salt baked chicken with crispy skin and salt on the side was marvelously prepared: tender, moist, bursting with flavour.  There were two seafood dishes: fish (garoupa?) velveted and then fried with peas and scallions, and a shrimp dish with broccoli.  Again, both were expertly cooked.  Both had the right amount of snap, crunch, and tenderness where those qualities should be present.  The one gripe I had was that the seafood itself was not the freshest.  Not bad, mind you, just not the freshest.  The shrimp were bland.  Finally, the vegetable dish was an assortment of mushrooms with the sprout of stalk, a common dish despite my uncommon description.  As with the rest, very well cooked, bursting with flavour.  This one, along with the crispy chicken, were my favourites.  I usually find that dessert at a Chinese restaurant is a bit of a failing.  At Yang's, we were served the sweet potato soup, along with some heart shaped jello.  Nothing exciting or markedly different versus a lower end restaurant.  It's like all the desserts come from the same place.  Overall, a clean and well serviced restaurant with some obvious skill in the kitchen.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Had my wedding here and have been going there every since for the occasional dim sum. It's a bit on the pricey side but most of the time the food is good quality. The pineapple buns are really good here! The service is really good here, especially if you go here a lot and the staff begin to know you."}
{"text":"I come back here time after time because they are one of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to in Toronto (GTA). The prices can be a little higher than the average Chinese restaurant in China Town, but the quality is excellent.   I can't say the service is the best during peak dim sum hours, but food comes to your table pretty fast! I frequent Yang's for dinner too, and they are surprisingly packed during dinner as well.   During my last visit, I booked a private room for my dad's 60th birthday and the minimum cost of  your meal needs to be over $400 to be able to even reserve the room. Well, 60 is a big number so we reserved a room for my dad - the general manager came to greet us and put together a set menu for us (five people in total) and it came out to be $1228.00 including tax. He indicated that they would only charge 6.5% tax if we paid by cash, which I thought was a good deal considering the set menu included dishes like abalone, birds  nest and shark fin soup.   One of my favourite dishes is the Thousand Island sauce shrimp balls (see pic) and the sea cucumber.. hmmmm yummm! I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"I went there for Dim Sum with some family members on Saturday, having read such good reviews on here. What a terrible mistake I made.....  First, I got to see first hand how reverse-discrimination works. We were a party of seven, and non- Chinese. We had people come in after us, with parties of six and seven, and talk( or should I say \"negotiate\") with the hostess in Chinese and get seated before us...WTF !! Like a scene out of Goodfellas, they even brought out a table and chairs and set them up in an open area near the front of the restaurant. None of us could believe it !!   After an hour of waiting, were were finally shown to our seats, but they had to clean off the table. That took 10 MORE MINUTES !!! We did not have a waitress, per se, we had a committee of non-English speaking people who were cleaning off other tables who we had to ask for a menu and a pencil to mark down what we wanted. Asking for drinks was another bother to them, and they weren't brought out right away.  Upon writing our orders down, we once again had to flag down a worker to place the order. I was searching the menu for crab claws- a staple of Dim Sum, and after a meeting of the minds speaking Chinese to one another, we were told that they didn't have any. When I asked why, having seen at least 30 crabs in the tanks at the entrance, they told me the \"shrimp was still frozen\" and had not thawed. Saturday is the biggest Dim Sum day of the week, and you're telling me that the food isn't ready to be prepared ??? BULLSHIT !!!!  25 minutes later, the food started coming out, little by little. We had to ask for hot sauce twice. The quality of the food was ok, but the attitude of the staff was infuriating !!  We were missing one food item after 30 minutes, and when we asked for it (not having even wanting it anymore), one of the waitresses told us it \"takes time to steam\". Ten more minutes went by before it finally came out.  When I was given the bill, I realized that the Dim Sum was way overpriced for the service we received. This was the first time I ever cheeped out on a tip, only leaving a few dollars on a $120 bill. I didn't feel bad, I should have left NOTHING !!!  A word to the wise- if you are a non-Chinese \"gwai-lo\" don't waste your money !!!"}
{"text":"I liked the decor, it is very modern, upscale and chic which enhances the dining experience. I went on a Sunday night and it wasn't very packed though. Service was very attentive (servers changed our plates several times to ensure we always had clean plates) and dinner overall was pretty solid in quality. This restaurant is on the slightly pricier side though.  I would recommend their salt-baked free range chicken. I found the chicken really delicious - nice salty taste, crispy skin, and completely moist/tender meat. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. I ordered other dishes which was tasty, but not highly memorable. I tried the curry crab but I found the curry spicy but bland. I would definitely come back to try their dimsum though."}
{"text":"The kind hostess opened the door for us and invited us in from the cold.  We were seated immediately in a beautifully decorated, clean dining room.  I was in awe at the fancy details - bigger teacups than usual, with handles; a Chinese soup spoon holder combined with chopstick holder; saucers for under the teapots;  modern square-shaped plates and bowls.  It took us a while to decide what to order - so many delicacies to choose from.  The prices are significantly higher than your typical Chinese restaurant, but so is the quality of the food.  Everything was very tender, full of flavour and the service was incredible.  Somehow, whenever you needed something, even if it was just something from across the table, a waiter was there to help.  Yet they didn't hover over you while you ate.  It was magical.  They even exchange your dirty plates for clean ones periodically, like they do at banquets.  Food highlights:  The starter soup was full of flavour.  I'm not even sure what was in it, but it was delicious.  The sweet and sour pork was the most tender I've ever tasted.  When our dessert soup came, we were also served heart-shaped lichee jello jigglers.  The Peking duck (which we did not order) seemed to be one of the most popular dishes of the evening.  They actually carve the duck in front of you, which they don't seem to do very often at other restaurants anymore.  My only complaint is that the teapot was way too small for our table of 6, possibly because our teacups were larger than standard.  It was also very expensive, especially for Chinese food.  The washrooms were decorated with a modern flair, and not too dingy.  Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"WOW! I typically don't give many Asian restaurants 5 stars (except one and for those who follow my reviews, you know which one:p) but Yang's was absolutely PHENOMENAL.  The seafood dishes are just spectacular and where else can you get those big crabs the length of a 7 year old!  Here is what we had:  1. Crab legs steamed with lots of good garlic and onions 2. Fried crab pieces including the roe 3. Steamed egg white with soy sauce - so simple and yet so good 4. Individual steamed soup with fish maw 5. Clams (my least fave) 6. Pork and veggies 7. Cjiu Chow style rice/congee in flavourful broth  This is a special occasion meal as it cost about $1000 with tip for the above dish, 7 people. It's a meal where, for the Asians, you take special out of town guests or you want to impress people. Service was very good, but considering what we were ordering, they were fawning over us. Next time if we just order rice and steamed vegetables, I doubt there will be any fawning over. Some of these waiters heralded from the Grand Yatt era (like in the 90'S) so we recognized each other instantly.  Totally want to come back here for a special seafood dinner, but dang, it was expensive...BUT SOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place disappointed me so much. Most of the reviews here are probably for lunch, when its cheaper, with a different menu. Dinner was a bit steep and it wasn't anything memorable except for the \"Crispy Pork\" that we ordered that was not even crispy. This wasn't a dish that was improperly cooked, it was pork, with no skin, in some sauce. It was seriously like thick slices of ham with glaze but called crispy pork just to mess with you, plus it wasnt even tender.  my food experience here wasn't  a distant cry from a place like bayview kitchen except this place had better plating, ambiance, and pinch more quality at double the prices. And thats double for the cheap stuff... the cheapest dish here is around 16$-18$ then it just skyrockets from there.. fried rice 36$, duck dishes $40 at least. These are regular sized servings like in any chinese resto.   No way am I coming back for dinner. On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised they gave free dessert. That is why I rated this place a 2."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dim sum here, no wait and good food, with 10% off bill with cash payment.  It's in the same plaza as Maxim, not very noticeable at first but glad we came across it on yelp!  They have some novel dim sum that other places don't, such and omlette sticky rice, pumpkin puff and durian pastry.  The steamed roll with tofu was very tasty too.  Will come back again for dim sum to try other items on the menue!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum was great on par with Golden Door and better than Ambassador. Same people running Grand Yatt - not loving the decor too noisy."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum in the GTA is here at Yang's.   Lots of variety but due to lack of space it has to be ordered, no carts.   There was nothing disappointing about the menu, it satisfied everyone, something for traditional older dim sum pros and some newer inventions such as mango fish jelly and a tofu veggie rice roll. Appropriate sauces always come and the orders are fulfilled promptly.   Lots of parking is always worth a half star in the review.   Here is the downside:  it is super crazy busy at prime dim sum hours.   It took about 45 minutes to get a table on mothers day. With that said you know the food is good because there is plenty of options in the area.   I've posted a picture of the lobster efu noodles. Very delicious and nice to order on special occasions."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum in a Hong Kong like setting. Slightly pricier than other options, but you get what you pay for at this place. The freshest seafood, some straight from the ranks that greet you upon arrival.   Pro tip: make a reservation for your weekend dim sum adventure. It'll shorten the wait to less than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Been to Yang's 3 times so far.  The place is nicely decorated in more modern style than most Dim Sum places.  They have private rooms as well which is pretty cool if you ever get one.  The dim sum is good and they have a few specialty such as Durian pastry.  I never tried it as I am not a fan of it but my Dad loves it a lot.  The place can get a tad loud but that is common for Chinese dim sum places where people gather around to talk.  Overall, price is average for dim sum in Richmond Hill as they are usually more upscale and pricey  than in Scarborough.  Good quality is good."}
{"text":"I read above reviews and got encouraged to visit this restaurant.    Very, very disappointed to tell the truth.  All dim sum dishes tasted rather plain, including the sticky rise rolls with tofu so nicely described by one of the reviewers. And we agreed on the terrible service. After spending at least 10mins in a 40% filled restaurant we ended up volunteering to get a menu ourselves.   The place unfairly boasts $$ pricing when it is truly $$$. My Chinese wife and I paid about $38 for 5 dim sum dishes, including 8.50 for a congee and $7 for shrips dumplings (shocker)! There were no prices mentioned on the menu so beware whenever placing numerous orders. You will be there for a surprise. We were.   We will not at all recommend  this restaurant and I feel  sorry for the regulars who frequent that place. They miss out on true good dim sim taste, service and yet are overpaying. There are at least three dim sum restaurants in the area to go instead: two on Leslie north and south of hwy 16 and one on Yong and south of major Mac.   That was our first and last time at Yang's."}
{"text":"A great place for Chinese food for me.  We go regularly for lunches and the dim sum there is great, along with dinner foods.  I haven't been to that many Chinese places in Toronto, but this place does very well, even when compared to restos I've been to in Hong Kong.  That's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Food is good and the servers are friendly. The 'managers' seems grumpy."}
{"text":"This review is for dim sum only. After becoming a regular at the restaurant just south of this place we decided to venture out a bit north and visited this place for lunch. The interior is more modern for sure and is not typical of your good chinese places. We were seated promptly. The service was good and consistent. Now for the dim sum I have pretty much given up on good dim sum with cart service in TO.  There are some exotic variations for dim sum but we decided to stick with the regular items. Har gow, Minced Beef meat Balls, Shrimp in rice noodle, Veggie roll, Fried squid. Beef ribs. Ha Gau the yardstick was done well. Other items were mix of hits and miss. Beef ribs were not right somehow.  The prices are in line with the competition for this kind of place. 3.5 Stars overall."}
{"text":"Been going here for dim sum and dinner for years. Its pretty good but a bit pricey. Quality is pretty consistent. Worth at least a try."}
{"text":"The best dish here is their vegetarian tofu rice noodle during dim sum time. You can taste the quality, care and effort in their food.  The dim sum is good and def. higher quality than most places. The service can be slow in the morning, during weekends because they aren't as busy - given there is no special pricing.  The food can add up because it is on the pricier side. But if you want to take friends to a nicer dim sum place, check out this place. For 7 people and 15 dishes, the cost was around $115. (Yes we are a family of eaters)"}
{"text":"Been here about a year or 2 ago.  Setting is very tight and certainly feels like a small restaurant.   Price is in the high side so i would prefer to dine at Casa Victoria instead as the quality is much better"}
{"text":"Slightly pricier, but the quality is top notch and worth the usually longer than average wait times."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants we came across during our visit to Canada ! The restaurant is nicely decorated. Very elegant and kind of makes you feel you are at a restaurant in China ... very modern and up to date! They had a special promotion going on for the Alaskan king crabs the night we came for dinner so of course we ordered one!  I have to say... the chef was amazing! Every dish we had was absolutely perfectly done! Maybe even better than the ones in China~ Very authentic! They are a bit on the pricey side, but it's worth it~"}
{"text":"My advice is do not go there at all. My girl friend and I went there for dim sum on Sept 6 morning. We ordered spring roll, steamed daikon cake, fried mochi (ham sui kwok), steamed ribs, steamed roasted pork bun and steamed shrimp dumpling (ha gao).  Foods are horrible and they are not even authentic. Steamed shrimp dumpling is big in size with multiple of small shrimps. But it doesn't have bamboo shoot, which is the must have ingredient in ha gao Steamed daikon cake is like mash potato with lots of MSG the worst is steamed ribs came out under cooked. I showed it to the manager and he told me it's because the ribs were marinated. So for marinated meats, some are pink? We are talking about pork, not beef here.  Taste of steamed roasted pork bun is bland. Fried ham sui kwok is greasy. I couldn't finish it and took it back to the hotel. 2 hours later, oil was dripping off from the ham sui kwok."}
{"text":"make sure check your bill before paying. they charged unnecessary small dish for no reasons."}
{"text":"Went around 3pm today for dim sum. No early bird or late afternoon special prices here on weekends. The dim sum dishes I had were all top notch and freshly made so this rating is based on the dim sum alone.  Never been here for dinner. I noticed the prices are extremely high for dinner at a Chinese restaurant but I guess that is why they have \"Fine\" in the name. Even their lunch hour menu specials are pricey. For example, a seafood udon lunch special is priced at $25 something when you can get that anywhere else for around $10.  Back to dim sum. It was $45 after tax/tip for five dim sum plates, which is just enough for 2 people. Although I definitely could have ordered more and finished them with no problem. Describing each below.  Har gow shrimp dumplings were delicious, and yes the skin is thicker than other places, but their shrimp filling ratio is also comparably bigger and done very well that you don't need to dip into any sauce.  Baked bbq pork puffs with pineapple comes in threes, and I highly enjoyed each. When picking this from the menu, I thought it was going to be bbq pork buns that is topped with pineapple crust. But still very yummy.  Beef ribs were priced at \"SP\" which is $9.80. This dish was just ok. They were a bigger portion than other dim sum restaurants but also much more expensive.  Deep fried sesame balls stuffed with egg custard were soooo good. Usually other dim sum places offer just red bean filling. I like red bean but I much prefer this! The piping hot custard oozes out of the fried sesame balls when bitten and werent too oily. Dreamy.  Saved the best for last... the baked durian puff dessert were perfection. I don't even like durian much but the durian filling was sweet and creamy and also the pastry puff outer were very buttery egg-tart like. Definitely getting this each time I'm back. Only complaint... wish they were bigger.  Decor is nice, with giant king crab tanks near the entrance. Service was also very friendly. Tea charge is $1.80 per person."}
{"text":"I read about this place probably 2 years ago and I have been wanting to go up to check out the dim sum for some time.  So 8 of us were there.  We tried      har gow,     - great size, nice thin wrappers and fresh tasting shrimp inside   fried squid tentacles - not really breaded but spiced very nicely, enjoyed these a lot   sui mai -      pork is very lean, I found it a bit dry because of it but tasty.   chicken feet    - very lean, so the fat is boiled off the chicken skin, so the skin  isn't greasy but just tasty.  Very, very good   shrimp cheung fun - shrimp were excellent quality and the rice roll was firm, not too soft - excellent    scallop in xo sauce cheung fun - this had chilis in it, I wasn't expecting but it was good   pork ribs in black bean sauce - I didn't try but others said it was good   sticky rice in lotus leaf - the scent of the lotus leaves came through in the rice and the rice was tasty.  I think maybe they washed the rice properly and used good quality rice.    the big sticky rice - I can't remember the chinese name, we call it the triangle in the bamboo leaf.  I tried a bit of it.  Lots of good stuff in it and again tasty   Seafood dumpling in consomme soup - I've only had this one other place and this was really good.  I would go back just for this one.    Vegetable dumplings - good but nothing special.  Just nice to have to get some vegetables into us.   fried bean curd roll - I didn't get a piece so it must had been good. it went fast   from the chef recommended dishes we had   shrimp dumplings with black truffles - we had to order more so more people could eat   them there are 3 in an order.  really good.   mango and foie gras - I can't remember what they called it but it was deep fried, I was thinking of a fried shrimp roll like a spring roll wrapper but it was  a heavier batter with the mayo dressing on it.  It was tasty but I think the  batter was heavy considering the foie gras.  The mango helped lighten it   and the sweetness was a nice contrast.   shrimp dumplings with foie gras - again the richness of the foie gras needed   something so I added a bit of the vinegar that we got when we ordered the seafood consomme soup and that made it much better as it balanced the  richness of the foie gras out.    Dragon dumplings - I didn't know what they were so we ordered out of curiosity.  They were steamed dumplings with a mixture of shrimp/pork chives.  They again weren't greasy or heavy but the flavour was just okay.  I thought they were fresh tasting in their lightness despite having meat in them but somehow they lack a bit of something.  Despite being very good, I didn't give the place 5 stars as we had ordered the bbq bun with pineapple as I had read it was very good and we ordered the lo bak go (turnip cake) and even after reminding them we ordered them, they still didn't show up.  So that was disappointing for service.      We were full at that point too but they lose a star for not getting that right!  Small place as there are many VIP rooms near the bathroom.  I like that they take reservations as it's not big and we were a big party and it would likely been a long wait for us.   I would definitely go again.  It was just under $175 for all of us and we did order multiples of some dishes.    I didn't eat supper that night. :)  and yes it's loud in there when it's busy.  nice setting."}
{"text":"The food is decent at best. It's not anything better than your typical dim sum. The waitresses are well mannered and respectful. However, the manager is just outright rude, arrogant, and quite frankly a douchebag. Alone, this made me not want to return to the restaurant. Probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had. When trying to make a reservation for a table of 30. My aunt was given the price of $1000 for the private rooms. However, when the reservation was made by her friend, the room was suddenly free of charge. Be careful."}
{"text":"Yang's does their dim sum very well, I'm no dim sum expert but I have eaten enough of it (both expensive and cheap) to know that these guys know what they are doing and try to put a little twist on traditional dishes.   I came here recently with family for lunch and we ordered a bunch of dishes, the standouts were:   Har Gow and Siu Mai: were so plump and juicy, they reminded me of why this is a dim sum staple  Turnip cake with pork: so soft it practically melted in my mouth and the pork added a nice meaty flavour  Several types of sticky dough dumplings (not sure what they are called): one was filled with veggies and nuts which added a nice crunch, I really enjoyed those dumplings, they were perfectly cooked. We also had some that were filled with sweet rice, those were A-OK.   Chicken feet: not the best I have ever had but certainly some of the biggest; those must have been some monstrous chickens they got them from.   Fried ribs: The BEST I have ever had, so big and meaty, perfectly crispy without being too dry. These were so good we had to order a second helping.   Egg tarts: we had to wait 20 minutes for these, but they came to the table hot out of the oven, the dough was perfectly flaky and the inside warm making these possibly the best egg tarts I have ever had.   All the other dishes we had were also well done; everything came to our table hot. The restaurant itself is quite nice, has a modern western feel not the Chinese banquet hall feel that is so common to many dim sum places in Markham-Richmond Hill. The service seemed pretty prompt and friendly all though I did not have much interaction with the waiters as I was not in charge of the ordering. I will likely return to Yang's for dim sum in the future as I can safely say it is some of the best dim sum I have ever had."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, and attentive. Lots of local customers from around the area, the plaza has lots of parking spaces. The decor is nice and modern (except all windows are covered/blocked) the food comes out really fast. They also have waitresses bring out special dishes around to lure you into ordering more cause it looks so delicious (even, when you know that you have already ordered too much) they know how to do business!  I agree that most of the dim sum dishes were delicious (some misses) but the biggest disappointment is the overly expensive price tag on them, the ingredients are normal, it's not like there is scallops in the Sui Mai or sharks fin. Everything was regular menu items you find at other Chinese tea places but with a huge price tag. I have been here 4 times (close to home) and each time cost is $60 (including tips) on a lunch. I love dim sum, but not really $60 worth, especially with so much competition and delicious dim sum in the GTA (except just a bit further out for me, when in extremely hungry)"}
{"text":"Very good dimsum with clean environment. They have a wide variety for dimsum restaurant - the traditional staple dishes and some unique fusion ones."}
{"text":"Was here a few months ago with friends for Dim Sum. The restaurant was upscale for a Chinese restaurant in Toronto, clean, and Dim Sum was delicious. We stayed so long chatting and enjoying the food there that I think we were the last one's to leave the restaurant after Dim Sum, though it was packed with people when we arrived."}
{"text":"This place had relatively good food, but the prices were ridiculous. We spent $100 for 7 for LUNCH. The service was slow, but the food was good. Also, they charged $11 just for tea.  I dont I think I would go back there. They service dimsum, but it's not in the traditional way, where people go around pushing carts asking if you want what they have.  The style of the place was really modern though. It had a mix of chandeliers, accented white ceilings, and yellow abstract opaque glass dividers in the VIP section."}
{"text":"The dimsum here is much worse than their decent sister store near Hwy 7.  For example, the har gao had a very thick and nearly opaque skin (corroborated by photos from other users) - a sign of an inexperienced chef using an easier starch/flour ratio to prevent breakage. Which could be fine if they didn't charge premium prices.   Bottom line: Skip this below average dimsum - plenty of places with better dimsum for almost half the price."}
{"text":"Pretty solid dim sum!   Definitely one of the better places; not overly salty or oily and good portions/presentation. Dishes are served hot and ready (dim sum served cold is a big no no) and service is quick. Dim sum selection is pretty standard, although I've had better beef meatballs.   I wouldn't recommend any type of spring rolls though (taro was a big mistake LOL), they're just incredibly oily and generally tasteless. I tried the Foie Gras special that was essentially a piece of foie gras and a piece of fruit I can't remember (mango?) wrapped in a spring roll and fried. I feel like they used duck and the consistency was like jello...felt like it's kind of a waste to use the ingredient like this. Dim Sum is a little more expensive than other places, but the decor and environment is more upscale. Place is also a lot larger than it looks (many VIP rooms).  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place for dim sum! Solid food and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Definitely not cheap. Food's good quality though.  Had: Squid tentacles - Ordered because Yelp said they were good. They were pretty good, but the larger pieces were a little bit chewy. Good flavor though. Curry cuttlefish - Cuttlefish were really tender. Curry flavor was good. Awkward how they put fries into the bottom though. Steamed cuttlefish = steamed fries. Defeats the purpose of fries. Also filler. Less cuttlefish if you put fries at the bottom of the dish. Spareribs with black bean sauce - Definitely better quality ribs than I'm used to at dim sum. Other than that, pretty similar. Taro chunks at the bottom. Also filler. Fois gras and mango deep fried rolls - Think standard shrimp salad rolls at dim sum, but with small bits of fois gras and strips of mango inside, and the salad dressing on of the roll. Five pieces? Something like that. Not enough fois gras. Salad dressing overwhelmed the entire thing. That being said, it was tasty. Not worth the price though. Snow pea shoot and fried tofu steamed rice noodle - for all you vegetarians out there, this one's delicious. It's an interesting combination, and the mouth feel is quite nice. Snow peas are fresh. Snow pea shoot steamed dumpling - Supposedly had scallop in it. I couldn't find any. That being said, the snow pea shoot filling was almost (or actually) entirely just that. It was really tasty. Lion head beef meatballs - Or just big beef meatballs. A tad more black pepper in these than I was expecting, but it was quite welcome. Meat was tender. Very much so. Not much beef flavor though. Deep fried taro shred with minced pork filling - Usually yum. This one was also yum. Taro shred was nice and loose (not dense and packed in. More like deep fried floss?) and the inside was moist. Good ratio of external taro and internal filling. Garoupa and bitter melon pan fried rice noodles? - I think that was the name of the fish...Fish was delicious. Bitter melon was a good kind of bitter. Pan fried rice noodles were done well. Good base. Sauce made it so it wasn't dry. Good portion for six people. Durian pastry - An odd green color. That being said, the inside is quite strong on the durian, and entirely delicious. Custard-like. The outside was flaky pastry and oh so delicious as well. Three pieces. A great way to end my meal.  If the prices were better and the service was better, I'd make this one of my go-to dim sum places. Well, that and if it was closer to home..."}
{"text":"One of the best Dim Sums I've had, I usually use Dragon Boat as a bench mark so it's up there.   The sticky rice wrapped in egg is very interesting, sorta like east meets west type of breakfast taste. Not a durian fan but had to try the durian pastry as I've never seen it presented as such, was surprisingly good however took a few excel gums to clear the durian taste.   Only gripe was that each item takes a while to come out but it seems everything is freshly made so I can't complaint too much."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family a month ago, thinking to myself yet another Chinese set dinner, had food like this 1000x, nothing to get excited about. Usually dislike places like this in GTA because there are many that use way too much seasoning, msg, grease, that for some reason drinking the blackest tea is the only way to cut the slimy film out of your mouth. OH and hours after the meal it can still make your burps smell horrifyingly repulsive, for me at least.   Well that's not the case here, at all!. Yang's dishes are refined and clean with punches of flavour where appropriate. I have to say whoever the evening Chef is did an amazing job that night! His/her cooking style suits my taste buds where it comes to fine Chinese food. They also have a spicy special set dinner for those who prefer something with more flavour and kick maybe I'll try that next time.  Yang's Fine Chinese Cuisine decor is not over the top or gaudy. The place has nice clean wood finishes no resemblance of a European Royal Palace or tacky gigantic fake gold.     Although, I must say there were several down sides to the dinner   - our steam fish was tiny tiny!! to split amongst 10 people some of us didn't have any, being asian, etiquette is to allow others to eat first. Ugh, who made up that rule?   -the lobster our waiter brought looked a bit smaller than he claimed but it's not like we had a scale with us, so, didn't argue there, he wasn't atrociously off by much .   -the same server was not as friendly or attentive as expected in a place like this, unless that's your preference.   Other then that, dishes were well made, albeit pricier but it is one of the better Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill and I definitely do recommend others to try the dinners here, especially the ones that can appreciate subtle grace and seafood.    Food - 8/10 Service- 6/10 Ambiance na decor - 8/10 Price - $$$ - $$$$ depending on what you order"}
{"text":"Went for 8lb lobster meal.  Got good recommendations from waiter on preferred method of preparation.  We wanted a lighter meal so we got it cooked with \"broth\", not maggi style or typhoon garlicky.  Lobster was very fresh and meaty. Winning dish was the lobster roe fried rice.  Very smoky and lots of wokhay. We also got peashoot, chicken, geoduck and other dishes. Everything was finely executed with a light touch.  Not too greasy or salty compared to others. Excellent service.  Wait staff were very friendly. Ended with complimentary desserts. Prices a little higher than your regular Chinese restaurants but cheaper than Casa Victoria.  Decent portions. They did not skimp on anything. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm nostalgic for the dim sum flavours I'm used to back home but this place still ranks up there as one of the best in the GTA for dim sum.  Undoubtedly high quality, fresh ingredients, just great sticky rice, fried oysters, shrimp noodles, short ribs. Yum.  The decor is also very nice for a Chinese restaurants, upscale with nicely set tables, packed and not enough waiters but still an enjoyable setting.  The prices are higher but you I think the value is still there, (Ruby is cheap but that comes with risks).  Find me here most every weekend with the family for the Sunday tea."}
{"text":"I came here only for the truffle har gow dimsum. Only downfall is that the delivery of this dish. 1/10 times I have ordered this dish it was not placed or forgotten. Wait time is not bad, some English speaking staff. Sometimes hard to order because the actually waiter isn't available. However the food and quality are delicious."}
{"text":"Yang's offers a slightly fancier take on dim sum, but definitely charges you for it. You order off a paper menu as oppossed to carts and the place was very busy on a Sunday. The dim sum itself is off a high quality, and they try to add nicer ingredients to spice up each dish. The service speed and quality is okay, in line with most chinese restaurants. As mentioned before the dishes can be pricey, averaging to about $8 per order not including the special price items. Overall, a nice place for dim sum, and makes sense if you are celebrating an occasion and don't mind a larger bill."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and we made reservations in advance. How is that we still waited more than 30 mins to get seated? What was worse was that the food also came out more than 30 mins later as well. They even came out one by one that our family managed to finish every last bit of it. It was a long lunch...but at least they don't charge for sauces. The funny party was when the treasurer thought we wanted to pay our bill when we didn't even eat yet - I assume he assumed that it was time to pay since we had no food on the table for a period of time. The food is good but pretty typical. They had some unique dishes that we wanted to try but my parents usually don't like eating stuff outside the norm so we tried to save money since their dim sum is a tad bit pricier. I like their idea of using dishes that has a fire underneath the food. The decor is also nice."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on dim sum. I have been here several times now for dim sum. I like how it is \"quiet\" compared to other massive places with a ton of people probably because they do not have an early bird deal. Good quality (consistent) food. Nothing crazy on the menu but they offer usual dim sum items. Clean presentations as well. It might be a bit pricey (at least $20/person without any leftovers to take home), but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"went to this place on monday for some good ol' dim sum. i have been here several years ago, but not for breakfast or lunch, just dinner.   first off, the food was okay. there wasn't necessarily anything in particular that made me go like DEAR LORD TAKE ME HERE AGAIN. i ordered   1. Har Gow or shrimp dumplings which is a MUST for me every time i go yum cha  - this tastes okay; just rather dry  - the shrimp was quite fresh  2. Steamed Turnip Cake with dried scallop  - quite good   - not a fan of the little shrimps in there but still good  3. Sticky Rice with Chicken wrapped in lotus leaf  - idk, but my mom didn't seem to enjoy  4. Pork Rice Roll (Churn Fun? Chun Fun? idk but all you Chinese ppl out there YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN RIGHT ?!?)  - i actually liked this  - i like how the outside is very soft and chewy-ish; hard and rough rice rolls are not the way to go for me  - the pork was a bit too fat for my liking  5. finally the GOON TONG GOW ?! (shark fin and seafood? dumpling soup)   - relatively okay; could've used a bit more flavouring   - no msg (yippee)   - okay amount of sharks fin (i don't think it's real though?! idk LOOL)   - this was a special item so it was $9.5  SO YEAH; other than food the decoration and interior is quite nice. it looks very classy and you know very fine-dining-esque. waiters were okay and um yeah das it  ** the food came quite fast to us ; 4 orders came in one go BOO YEAH?!"}
{"text":"As a foodie who grew up with Chinese food and ate dim sum countless times - I typically held Chinese restaurant to a much higher standard. On this note Yang's scores with flying colors for both their dim sum and dinner service.  Their dim sum is particularly impressive with good taste for the familiar items (har kaw, siu mai, sticky rice, chicken feet, tripe, tendon) as well as some of the more unique ones (fish maw soup, duck feet, fried squid tentacle). Really impressed with not just flavor but also the quality of the food itself and preparation / presentation. Yang's definitely on the finer end of Chinese dim sum which is increasingly becoming commoditized - a rare find. To put it simply - we ordered at least ten different varieties of dishes and were not disappointed with a single one.  On top of food, the ambiance and interior at Yang's is also rated excellent, clean and inviting. The interior is bright and modern accompanied with individual wash room which is also spotless. Again, this quality is hard to find among most dim sum places.   Service is very prompt and courteous - and I'd rate it as good considering we went during a busy Saturday brunch.   Definitely would return."}
{"text":"This place is great for dim sum and cantonese dishes. The restaurant uses top quality ingredients and depending on what you want to eat (e.g., geoduck), I recommend calling ahead to check for availability.  We love the bird's nest egg tart, garlic flavored oysters and geoduck!"}
{"text":"Despite seeing all the other rave reviews, I really wasn't impressed with the dim sum here. It was passable but didn't quite meet the expectations of a fine cuisine."}
{"text":"We had reservations but still had to wait a good 15-20 minutes before we got our table. The service was also mediocre, as we had to ask the same waitress 3 times for the same thing and ended up having to ask another staff. The food tasted great, but was extremely oily!"}
{"text":"This place is very expensive during non- early bird dim sum time. Food is average . I would recommend you head north one block for the other fine dinning dim sum place for cheaper and better quality   In the order hand, service was good and a candle is lighted to keep your tea nice and hot."}
{"text":"I have been to Yang's for dim sum once.  I found the decor very exquisite and expensive.  I perceived that they wanted to give the impression that they were very high end to 1) elevate the perception of their food and 2) justify the high prices.  Truth be told I didn't like their dim sum.  Nothing really impressed me to say \"Oh, this is good\".  And thank heaven, someone else picked up the tab.  Food - 3 stars  Overall experience: considering the polite yet aloof service (nothing say blue blood like aloofness), the high prices, yet only average food - 2 stars"}
{"text":"I must say that Yang's is probably one of the best dim sum places that I have ever visited in a long while. The prices are quite a bit higher but it is well worth it in my opinion.   Got here at about 12pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty much full. This place is extremely small from what I could see. I'm not too sure if there was another area in the back. We put our order in and food started arriving within 5 minutes. The service was fast and very efficient as the empty dishes were taken away right when we finished them.   As for the food I really like the variety of different dishes they had and a few of them I thought were pretty uniqe and hard to find at other dim sum places like the cashew nut pumpkin puff and the sticky rice wrapped in a bun. There are a few other rare items but did not get to try. Maybe next time. Some of the dishes that really stood out for me was the fried squid. It was fresh and cooked to perfection with a carmelized outter layer. Another dish I really like was I believe beef muscle/tendon. I usually don't like tendon by itself but these were nice and soft and had a sauce I enjoyed. I also really liked the cashew nut pumpkin puffs. They actually looked like little pumpkins and tasted really food.   We ordered 14 dishes and the bill came to be about $75 taxes in. On the bill it said that the charge for tea was waived and 10% off the dishes aswell. Not too sure if this was like an early bird special price but even with the discount I found the bill to be high but worth it in the end.  4.5 stars - the only drawback is the price."}
{"text":"Shrimp dumpling & the rice rolls skin was too thick, it should be silky, thin and slightly transparent which it wasn't.    They do have a solid chicken feet in Chinese spices (ginger powder), and soy sauce chow mein was made well, light and flavorful.  All and all decent, however not sure I would be back with all the great options around."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several yum cha or as Americans call it dim sum places and my family is Chinese with some Cantonese mixed in, plus every weekend my family with aunts uncles cousins would go to Oakland Chinatown for yum cha. We usually designate the best Cantonese speaking family member to order for us in Cantonese. Let me just cut to the chase and say that this is the best yum cha restaurant in Toronto and one of the best I have been to in my life! Only go here for brunch because that's when they serve what white people know of as Chinese tapas. The flavors are just right and perfect. The only thing I wish they had were baked BBQ pork buns with the crusty tops which seems to be more common in the west coast in California and Vancouver. Skip the mango pudding which has tapioca pearls in it(gross texture). You must order these following items: Steamed egg yolk buns Steamed bean curd roll Grilled octopus tentacles Beef tripe Green tea lotus seed steamed mochi(on separate special menu) Baked durian Spare ribs steamed (my husband's fave) Sticky is really good too but unlike certain west coast places some people got egg yolks and others did not.  Overall best fresh quality Chinese brunch spot with a full house of Cantonese speaking people. Only Chinese people seem to eat here so you know it's authentic. I wouldn't go for dinner though.......make reservations for brunch!!!"}
{"text":"If I had the chance I will give this location zero star.  Ok so I didn't make a reservation, and the staff just tell me wait and hanging, no number, no record of my name.  They were taking their customer with reservation more seriously than me like typical Chinese restaurant.  So I got the table, I got seated in their VIP room and ordered my food and it never come after 1 hour.  We just leave.  People at the other table in the same room never got their food either.  It on 7 pm on a saturaday night which is prime dinner time.  So I will avoid this place from now on"}
{"text":"We were guests of a wonderful Chinese family we have gotten to know through the marriage of our god daughter. They treat us to dim sum each time we visit. This was no different.  This place has several private rooms, which allows for conversation. The main room is very noisy.  They ordered. We started with a form of a baked bun that had bar-b-que pork inside. They were small with a wonderful flavor. They ordered dumplings, sticky rice and steamed beef balls. There were other dishes that I do not know the name.  All were good and most were ones we had not had in the past.  The final dish was a wonderful noodle soup with vegetables and seafood.  We finished the meal with a steamed cake. This was also new and very tasty. One version had bean paste that reminded us of chestnuts and the other was filed with taro root.  Both were good. I would like this again.  This is a great spot for dim sum; it helps coming with someone who knows what to order.  I hope we get to come back."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum over the holidays. I can't believe I had never tried this place out as it is very close to my house.  The décor is modern with a bunch of tanks full of fish, lobster and snow crabs. I really like how the entrance is separated from the main dining by some tanks and walls as it really helps keep the heat in during the winter season. The only downside to this space is that the windows are all blocked off; there is no natural sunlight coming in.  The dim sum at Yang's is slightly pricier and they do not have any early bird specials but you get what you pay for. The full-leaf tea is higher quality and more flavorful; surcharge is $1/person.  We ordered the siu mai, durian puff pastry, bbq pork bun and shredded taro cake; the total came to about $25 for 2 people. The siu mai were large and very delicious; everything else was mediocre. The durian puff pastry was very disappointing as they were oddly shaped (spheres), small and there was too much dough/pastry and not enough filling.  The service here is great, the interior is a lot smaller than I had imagined from the outside but I suppose that half of the restaurant space is occupied by the kitchen."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from their food. Currently sitting by my bathtub as i write this review, throwing my guts up. All patrons, make sure to double check your food before eating... throwing up from 4am until now (6:30am) is honestly the worst feeling in the world."}

{"text":"The food was good here and the service was excellent as well. We had a simple dinner here (mostly fish, veggies, pigeon). We also had a piece of abalone each. I honestly thought it was just average though the sauce was good. The abalone was $19.99 each @@.... ! A tad insane imho. On certain nights though they are $13.99 but still..... ok maybe some of us need to have better appreciation for this delicacy.  Yang's has lovely bright decor. Although there were a few occupied tables, the restaurant was generally quiet unlike ur typical early morning dim sum places. Good! I hate when it gets roudy.. can't hear a damn thing.  I duno how... but our party had made a reservation & somehow it was ignored. We did end up getting a table of course but I'm not sure how that can be messed up since it wasn't even that busy when we got there lol"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. No acknowledgment from the employees when asking for anything."}
{"text":"We were there for dinner on a Saturday night. most people seem to arrive after 630pm. so if you want to go without reservations come at 530pm. we ordered one of the set menus. Overall food and service was good! I'd go back more often but it's on the pricer side. so ewe save it for special occasions. Note: you can often tell the quality of the food by how well the washrooms are kept in Chinese restaurants :) This place had 5 separate restrooms which were well kept."}
{"text":"Yesterday dim sum today geoduck.   Yesterday dim sum for har gaw was amazing. Chicken feet and siu maai was really good. Worth the price and service was good. Then we saw the geoduck 3-4 person meal and it was good they did geoduck right.  We had a geoduck over a bed of beansprout and it was perfectly cook.  Then we have a lobster with noodles and it was nice and tasty even the noodle had lobster taste.  There was a veggie which was good and finally the soup rice with geoduck ends.  I have to say if i could give 10 stars for the geoduck with soup rice i would give it bc the soup was perfect and the meat was soft n not chew. In the end this place for dimsum and geoduck is great"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. This place used to be owned by the previous owners of the one on Bayview and Bridges (now Empress) but moved over to here a lot time back with majority of it's key staff.  Dim sum wise, it's Richmond Hill quality, which means good. The standard items are all fairly decent, not particularly mind blowing but definitely acceptable. Recommendations outside the norm would be:   1) Seafood pancake (I like how it's crispy not soggy) 2) Crab/chicken congee (first time I had today, really great flavor, you get the full crab right in the congee 3) Fried oyster - good meaty oyster with a light batter  Service is pretty good here. They are very attentive and helpful. It's a smaller place so waiters are not running around too much where they forget things."}
{"text":"On February 12, 2015 my partner and I went to Yang's for Dim Sim.  Upon arrival in the parking lot it was clear that something was wrong.  There was ice forming everywhere and there appeared to be water coming from underneath an exterior door of the restaurant.  We went in and we were seated.  I heard a ruckus from the VIP and bathroom area towards the back of the restaurant.  Upon further inspection it appeared that a pipe had ruptured in the bathroom.  There were men and trucks using hoses and wet vacs trying to get up the water.  The toilets were not functioning.  There was even a hose going into the kitchen.  Meanwhile workers and customers were walking back and forth across the wet, contaminated carpeting.  For some reason I did not fully comprehend the gravity of the situation.  After all they were still serving and the restaurant was packed.  Needless to say this is day 4 after the lunch and my spouse and I are both still sick with diarrhea.  Clearly they were violating health codes and they should have closed.  I have never seen such a wanton disregard for the health and safety of the public.  Personally I will never eat at Yang's ever again.  Management that would endanger the health of the public for a buck is clearly capable of just about anything."}
{"text":"Yang's is definitely better than your average dim sum place, which I suppose my 4/5 rating already tells you. That says a lot coming from someone who generally has neutral feelings toward dim sum. My boyfriend and I ordered 11 dim sum dishes here--definitely way more than two people could finish! The four dishes that stood out to us the most were the five spice cuttlefish tentacles, beef ribs, spare ribs, and egg tarts. They were very good. The turnip cakes should have been crispier. The chicken feet, pork and shrimp siu mai, dried shrimp and seafood pancake, steamed duck feet, and BBQ pork buns were average. Yang's was the only dim sum restaurant we went to while in Toronto, so I don't have any other spots to compare it to in the city, but it's definitely worth a visit if you are looking for dim sum.

{"text":"Full Review in Blog - highlight dishes below:  The Space:  Like many dim-sum restaurants Yang's is in a non-descript strip mall and with white table cloths, icicle style lighting fixtures, and venetian blinds as the only real decorations to the room save for mirrored pillars the overall feel of the space was certainly less ornate than Grand Chinese, Lai Wah Heen, or Jade in Richmond but with comfortable chairs and an immaculately clean dining room there was certainly nothing 'wrong' with Yang's - just not a lot of \"eye candy\" to distract from the food and friends.  The Service:  Service at a Chinese restaurant, and particularly for dim sum, is difficult for me to gauge.  Dishes arrive with one word descriptions as the kitchen prepares them, plates piled up but disappeared quickly when emptied, and a variety of excellent teas were replenished without request throughout the meal.  If what I just said constitutes good service, then the service was good and perhaps even great as even our individual plates were replaced with clean ones if they became dirty and serving chopsticks were present at each seat as opposed to one or two pairs as I'd seen elsewhere.  Deferring to the experts on just how to tip I paid what I was told assuming that we had tipped well for a job well done.  Wu Gok:  Otherwise known as taro dumplings and one of my favorite ingredients whether boiled, griddled, or fried.  Not oily in the least and perfectly crisp on the exterior these sweet dumplings exploded with flavor giving way to a creamy and savory interior rife with pork and chives.  With three to an order our two orders would suffice, but I could have eaten the half dozen myself and been quite happy.  Rice Congee with pea shoot, prawns and thousand year eggs:  Apparently a bit of a shocker to my tablemates that my Caucasian self would request this dish I half explained my fascination with puddings, tapiocas, and oatmeal before digging in and while not as amazing as the totally non-traditional rice porridge at Red Medicine both the texture and delicate balance of savory tones at Yang's was the best 'traditional' congee I've ever had.  Thin but toothsome, subtle but nicely augmented by herbs, and studded with an ample helping of snappy prawns plus at least five thousand year eggs I know I ate more than my fair share of this dish...and continued to pick at it throughout the meal until it was gone.  Pork and Shrimp Fried Rice Dumpling:  Another taste, another texture, and perhaps the most interesting dish of the meal these delicious gobs were described by Charles as 'Ham Shui Gok ,' and are apparently made by frying a stuffed glutinous rice ball.  Crispy and golden on the exterior yet slightly chewy with just a bit of grease within the center of these pockets were a molten amalgam of pork, shrimp, shiitake, chives, and something vegetal/crunchy for added texture and a bit of balance to the otherwise intense savory notes.   Fried Cuttlefish tentacle with five spices:  I have no clue what the five spices were as it did not taste like traditional \"Chinese 5 Spice\" but with Sichuan pepper, salt, and cinnamon definitely present these tentacles were not coated, breaded, and abused like their Italian (or bastardized Italian/American 'calamari) counterparts, but instead very lightly fried to render the skin crisp and the interior tender with just a touch of chew.  Generally fond of squid and cuttlefish, but rarely when it is fried, these were excellent and definitely something new and unexpected.  Crispy Foie Gras and Mango Rolls:  Served later in the meal that I'd have originally expected I was actually surprised how well this dish worked as 'dessert.'  Featuring a crunchy shell without much grease and an interior rife with crisp unripened mango and creamy foie gras at an approximately 2:1 ratio plus a squiggle of citrus tinged mayo the flavors all melded nicely to form a very complex bite that I was fortunate enough to enjoy a few times over as some members of the group did not favor foie.  The Verdict:  Rarely one to suffer a 'bad' meal and almost never one to experience 'bad' food as I spend a lot of time researching my agenda there are some meals that are greater than the sum of their parts because everything simple comes together and Yang's was definitely one of those meals.  From the food to the setting to the service all of the aspects of the restaurant were excellent and yet all paled in comparison to the company - a great group of folks without whom I'd have probably not even heard of Yang's let alone have the opportunity to learn so much and enjoy so many different tastes - I'd happily do it again anytime."}
{"text":"BE VERY CAREFUL THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES !!!

Will complain big time against this people   THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES !!!  Never go there !!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Dim Sum on a Sunday around lunch. Like most decent dim sum places, it was swarming with people just as eager as we were to get at some shui mai's and egg tarts.   SERVICE:  The wait-time for a table of 4 was loooong, about 45 minutes - seemed almost as though larger tables would get seated faster (since there were more of them). Once we were seated though, the food came fast enough. Service was friendly and attentive, at least by Chinese restaurant standards that is.  FOOD:  They didn't have my favourite Shanghai Scallion Pancakes, but had a fairly good variety of Cantonese-style dim sum. The \"Har Gow\" broke apart too easily, so we were pretty much eating a ball of shrimp with a wrapper next to it. The \"Shui Mai\" was too bland, and a bit on the cold side. Other than that, the rest of the dishes were on point:  Pork pastry with sesame Shui mai with shrimp  Har gow Congee Crepe seafood  Sesame seed ball with sweet egg Egg tart Sponge cake Veggie dumpling Pork dumpling Sticky rice  ATMOSPHERE:  Like I said, this place was really busy. Perhaps there's less traffic early/later on weekends, and during the week. Decor is fairly standard, though I liked had they had  2 sets of chopsticks (one of serving, and one for eating), and candle to keep the tea warm - don't see this too often.  VERDICT:  Will try again, but at a different hour or day."}
{"text":"It has been 5 plus years since my last visit, and I must say, there's been some changes to this fine dining.  Even though I am giving it 3 stars, I actually preferred it the way it was back in 2011/2012.  Service and presentation has gone down while prices have gone up.  In terms of quality of Dim Sum, it's about the same.  For Yelpers wanting to give this a try, I would suggests staying w/ the \"unique\"/SP/XL Dim Sums to see what the difference is all about between regular Dim Sum and slightly altered versions of the original via higher ingredients.  For the 60% more in pricing, you might as well go off the beaten path and try something different."}
{"text":"We visited Yang's for dim sum after missing the boat for early-bird special at Dragon Boat. 1 hour wait at Dragon Boat even at 10am! On the other hand, Yang's was operating at half capacity when we arrived at 10:25am.  Overall, the dim sum here was solid, considering the presentation and flavors, and meets expectations for this type of high-end restaurant. All the dishes were very clean and not greasy.  The durian puff pastry in particular was a standout. Its green exterior was firm but flaky and layered, the interior consisted of a thick durian custard that's highly aromatic.  I also ordered the black truffle & shrimp dumpling from the \"must-try\" menu. I tried something similar at Chef Tony's in Vancouver and was disappointed. Yang's version was so much better, the addition of black truffle made the dumpling more aromatic. But what I was more impressed with was the fact that the shrimp dumpling was perfectly pleated, the shrimp was bouncy, and the skin was moist. The combination of these points made this dish worthy of the \"SP\" price.  Everything else was just OK. The rice roll was slippery and the fillings were ordinary. I had the same feeling about the turnip cakes, they're standard and less oily than the average, very well executed. The quality of ingredients, creativity, and presentation of the dim sum here was 10x better than anything we have at home in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Yummy dim sum .. A bit costly but the quality and taste excellent. Try the cuttlefish the hot and sour seafood soup and all the dumplings great. The only problem is the service they are not that nice and think they are doing you a favour by eating there ..  Despite same food it worth it .. That's why 4 as opposed to 5 stars .. The hostess won't ever smile.... Not sure why"}
{"text":"One of the best dim sums in Toronto.  A little pricey but worth the price.  Food is hot and tasty.  A large selection of dishes.  They also have variations on the standard dim sum classics.  Best to make a reservation if you come after 11.  It gets very busy on weekends.  I would recommend coming at 10:30.   I have never been for dinner but for dim sum its great."}
{"text":"Fine cuisine indeed! The dim-sum can hold its own against the very best of Toronto.   The service can get a tad sloppy during their busy hours. You have to understand that this place is really meant for larger groups. They sit around large round tables and chat about the good old days while the waiters take their time with bringing in the dishes. In my first visit, I walked in alone thinking that I'll have a quick bite. The waitress was very confused and had to make accommodations with her manager to seat me somewhere.     Also, this is a Chinese Chinese restaurant frequented by the large Chinese community of Bayview Hill. In all my visits, I have never seen person who didn't look Chinese. For that reason, they have certain menus (wine list I think?!) don't contain a single word of English and the wait staff don't speak English very well. I recommend you do some research before walking in. Otherwise, you're in for some confusing and awkward moments.      Food - 8/10  Service - 5/10"}
{"text":"one of the highest quality dim sum in toronto with quality fillings and not just crap inside. Delicious food also at dinner time, perfect for a great cantonese shared dinner with a big group/family. They also have really expensive fancier special menus that i think you order ahead of time for a special party. All dining scenarios Ive tried above, and are delicious. If you want quality in your food, and not just deep fried doughy crap that you might get at the other cheaper dim sum places around town, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"How's the dim sum at Yang's Fine Chinese Cuisine?  A-OK!   I probably will be back for their Durian Pastry!! They are made to order fresh from the oven.... I ate the whole order as I am the only one at the table that would eat durian!  Other dim sum are all nicely done. I do expect that at this price point!   Service is lacking as the restaurant was packed even for a weekday lunch break.  I might come back for more dim sum if my friend wants a gathering. But there definitely have other options in the area!"}
{"text":"The dim sum were so so so yummy and we love the creative dim sums. We will come back XD"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is excellent and well prepared, definitely worth the price. The even have some dim sum dishes featuring ingredients not usually used in Chinese cooking, like fois gras and black truffle.  The restaurant is rather small compared to other suburban dim sum restaurants, the tables are placed very close to each other so getting in and out is a little squeeze, and the dining room is rather loud dispite its size (hey, it wouldn't be a Chinese restaurant if it wasn't noisy). The decor is very tasteful, with very nice quality table linens, larger tea cups with handles (what better way to enjoy their excellent tea with), and the bathrooms are clean and spacious.  The flat sticky rice rolls stuffed with snow peas and fried tofu is my favorite. The snow peas are actually snow pea shoots, which are extremely tender, suculent and delicate tasting, and the fried tofu was light and complements the rice roll very well.  Their fried dim sum dishes were perfectly fried. Not heavy, greasy and over-fried like many dim sum restaurants.  Their wireless credit card scanner was not working when we were there, which was their only minor fault. Luckily we had cash and the waitor was extremely apologetic.  The restaurant gets really packed on weekends, but if you go before 11:30am the wait is rather short."}
{"text":"I came to Yang's Chinese Cuisine for dim sum twice in the last month, after my go-to dim sum restaurant in Richmond Hill, Ambassador Chinese Cuisine, abruptly closed down in September after 18 years in business (my heart broke a little).   And onto the food!  Baked BBQ pork puffs with pineapple (L)- this was delicious, a perfect combination of savoury and sweet. In addition, the pastry was really nice and flaky.    Deep fried minced pork and taro puffs (S)- also a pretty good version that wasn't overly greasy.   Crystal jumbo shrimp har gow (L)- one of the only misses. The shrimps were plump and juicy, but the dumpling skin was too thick and effectively ruined the delicacy of the har gow.    Fried rice noodle roll with XO sauce (XL)- I have to say, this was not the best version I've had. In fact, the Ambassador's version was a lot tastier. But for those with a heartier appetite, it would still be a very good choice to fill you up.   One stand out was definitely the steamed soft egg custard buns (L). I find that this dish is usually either a hit or miss, and here it was executed very well. The bun to filling ratio was just right (usually there's too much bun), and the runny golden custard center was absolutely heavenly.   Steamed rice noodle roll with jumbo shrimp and yellow chives (L). Again, the shrimp was excellent, but the yellow chives were nowhere to be seen (or perhaps I was just unlucky). Nevertheless, this was generally well done.   Steamed BBQ pork bun with abalone sauce (S). As with the baked BBQ pork puff, the filling here was excellent, and the bun was delightfully fluffy.   The avocado and shrimp roll (L) didn't look overly fancy, but it was actually very tasty. I didn't detect a lot of avocado, but I liked the roll a lot nevertheless.  Baked cashew and pumpkin puffs (M). The puffs adorably resembled tiny pumpkins, complete with a cashew stem. But flavour-wise, I wished the pumpkin was more intense.  Steamed mango custard layer cake (M). Aside from my affinity for custard, I really loved the lightness of the cake. The mango was a nice addition that didn't overwhelm the custard flavours.   On the whole, the dim sum here is well-executed and tasty, albeit quite pricey (tea is $1.20 per person, S- $3.10, M- $4.20, L- $5.20, and XL- $7.80). That said, I enjoyed the food a lot so I will likely come back for more dim sum. And on top of that, no crazy wait time here! What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of tables inside the restaurant, it's a lot bigger than what I expected. There's the main part and then more rooms at the back for VIPs.   My aunt and uncle love coming here and that's saying quite a bit considering they live in North York. The food is quite food but this time the noodles were a bit on the dry side and there was hardly any beef.   It gets pretty loud in the restaurant so be prepared to speak loud in order  to be heard."}
{"text":"Great place for a good dimsum. Price falls a bit pricy compare to normal dimsum places but I think the taste of food and decor justifies."}
