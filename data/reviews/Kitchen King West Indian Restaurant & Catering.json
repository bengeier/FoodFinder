{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Toronto by far, and I've been to a lot of Jamaican restaurants in Toronto. The food is top notch. However,  at nights the jerk pork will run out or take a while. Do call ahead.  The Jerk chicken us comparable to scotchies in Jamaica, just as good and better."}
{"text":"I'm a real Jamaican. I've been to many Jamaican joints in the east end. Hands down kitchen king has the best jerk chicken. Authentic authentic authentic to the bone. They cook the jerk in a jerk grill all year round. IT IS THE BEST JERK IN THE EAST END. I promise you'll agree and will have to write a review on how satisfied you were. And their fried chicken and oxtail is also so amazing. Their food taste exactly from back home in Jamaican, real home style cooking. If you're in the east end and craving some authentic jerk, definitely make kitchen king your 1st stop. And make sure you get the sauce with whatever dish you order. It just makes it that much better. Big ups to kitchen king!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken! Very flavourful. Smokey and tender. They cook their meat in drum style BBQs in front of the restaurant.  This place came recommended by a friend and it certainly didn't disappoint. Had the lunch special for $5.99 and it was perfect for a quick lunch. It's in a somewhat rundown plaza at the corner of McCowan and Nugget. Look for all the U-Haul trucks. There are a few tables but it is primarily a take out spot."}
{"text":"Went here late one Friday looking to try the Jerk pork, unfortunately they ran out but I instead got the medium oxtail with rice and peas and coleslaw...MY GOD, it was pretty awesome...I'm a dude who eats jamaican food at least twice a week and this is by far the best I've had in a minute! Next I'm hoping to try the jerk pork and the jerk chicken since I've seen the jerk pan grill outside =)"}
{"text":"Passed by this location since my friend and I were int he area. We could smell the jerk chicken cooking, and we had to try it.  We went in and I felt like I was in the Caribbean (and yes, I know what that feels like since my background is Caribbean). Older style wood tables and chairs, a nice bar, cute server, and football (soccer) on the tv with everyone watching and relaxing to reggae in the background.  The jerk chicken tasted pretty good. A small was $5 and consisted of about 4-6 pieces. My friend got the medium for $10, and consisted of about 6-8.   Definitely would recommend if you are in the area and feel for a Caribbean experience."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is amazing if you can get any. They always run out. Not sure if they sell out or do not make enough but the last 3 times I have gone they were out. Rice and peas r perfectly seasoned and cooked,  other good choices are the cow foot and oxtail"}
