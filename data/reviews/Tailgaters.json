{"text":"Don't waste your time, everything tastes like nothing even the onion rings taste like it came from the dumpster. Don't waste your time. Would not recommend to anyone, go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead."}
{"text":"Veronica the server is horrible! Worst service I've had in my life! I don't know how she still has a job!"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood bar where personality rivals good pours and fast service. Rick the manager is always present and whatever the game, he not only makes sure it's on but that volume accompanies the event. Who wants to hear music when the playoffs are on?! I'm not a huge fan of the food but I don't usually go to a bar to fill my belly! I'll save my two biggest favorites for last...1) The two outdoor areas! They make a smaller bar seem huge. The patio has plenty of seats and misters and the \"indoor deck\" is a great place to watch sports while still having access to the bar. 2)the staff is AWE-SOME...nothing like a bartender remembering your name which seems to always happen with 'keeps like Sasha, who is my personal fave! She seems to really enjoy her job which ain't easy to find these days. Props to her!! Keep up the good work Tailgaters!"}
{"text":"Wow....was looking forward to a night out with the wife.  We wanted to try Tailgaters as the reviews were all very good.  However very disappointed.  We sat at the bar received our drinks quickly.  We wanted to order food at the bar but was ignored for 20 minutes.   Even tried to call out to the bartenders and it didn't help.  They were only interested in their \"regulars\".  Maybe we will try again someday....."}
{"text":"When we head out for Happy Hour, we almost always head for Tailgaters. We rarely get bad service. A possible glitch once or twice, but the rest of the time the service was great and the people always had a smile. The food we order is always tasty and hot. Great atmosphere. And you gotta join the beer club!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! The waitress said she thought another person was supposed to be helping us, and the other person thought the waitress was taking care of us but no one checked on us once! Never served us more drinks, or gave us napkins. The food was disgusting, just such a terrible experience"}
{"text":"I've never been inside, but I LOVE that they are a non-pizza option for food delivery in Surprise.  The menu is sure to have something for everyone, and everything I've tried has been really good."}
{"text":"WOW! let down in every aspect of a restaurant/ bar. One of only 6 people in the place and have to stand up and wave to get a drink, nope that doesnt work, try yelling to interupt the bartender of her conversation. Ordered the most expensive calzone which was the feature on the menu since it a pizza place and it was the worst calzone ive ever had. Tried some apps, nah they are bland. Was going to try a pizza next because I just want this place to be good since its one of the only places out here and the guy behind me is getting thrown out by the manager because he does not like his pizza! HAHAHA im sorry hopefully they work the kinks out"}
{"text":"I like this place alot.. Me and my boyfriend go alot to watch football games on sundays. Great tv set ups. Food isnt bad. Service is good. Nice place near my house. Only thing is booths are not that comfortable and i have a bad back."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were amazing, nice clean bar and excellent service, our server Brittany was totally awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I guess that on a Saturday night it would be busy but I am sitting at the bar being ignored. The bartenders are not at all people who care about their bar but way too busy with everything else I ordered wings and they were ok but screw the service at the bar."}
{"text":"The pizza is great and the beer is cheap!

This is not a place I would go on a date or business meal but for drinking and eating with friends I like.

Their pizza is flavorful and people seems to be happy with their meals.  Some of the items can be hit or miss but the prices are fair."}
{"text":"A bunch of us went for happy hour. Got a bbq burger, pizza, boneless wings, cheese sticks, long islands and margharitas. Drinks were poor at best, wings were ok, sticks were good, burger was ok but the onion rings on the burger were horrible. The service was fine. Not somewhere I would frequent."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband on a date for lunch was hardly anyone there was told to sit anywhere so we sat towards the back. The service was terrible My husband was treated very well and I was treated like crap all the men in there got great service ummm excuse me women like sports bars too and hello I'm there with my husband lady back off poor service and not so great food was hoping to go back for karaoke but I don't think I'll be going back I'll stick with Booty's next door!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a sports bar person but Tailgaters is great. Have been several times with \"just the girls\" and other times with husband and friends. The food is delicious and the menu is full of a variety of items and specials that would please everyone in your party. The Barbecue chicken pizza is fabulous, the sliders are great and for vegetarians the salads are a good choice by the way- happy hour is all day!!"}
{"text":"Our good friend Rosie from scotland who lives in surprise raved about this place  and the manager Rick so we decided to stop there on our way home.    What a fun BAR, also a place that you would expect the food to just bar food , it was terrific..  We had pizza, apps and my wife asked for a special salad that was not on the menu they happily made it.  the place is very relaxing despite being a sports bar so to speak, the staff very attentive. We stayed way longer than expected and Rosie no need to ask for Rick , he came by our table shortly after we arrived and introduced himself and could not do enough for our party.    As a former restauranteur i believe your staff and ambience often take on the personality of the manager/owner and you could see this throughout.  GREAT JOB GUYS!!!"}
{"text":"Go someplace else! This place was super slow, we never got refills, they move at a snails pace and they weren't even busy! I got a dried up hamburger on a crunchy bun that swallowed the meat. There was no flavor or any condiments! The fries were super greasy and tasted frozen. We also got the club sandwich which looked better, but it also lacked flavor. We had to ask for ranch 3 times for our appetizer before someone brought it to us. The first waitress looked at us like she was annoyed when we asked for some. She said, \"ya\" and walked back to the bar area and started chatting. We asked our waitress twice before she finally brought it after our entrees had arrived. The entire time we were there the manager kept apologizing to the table behind us about the cooks. He said their pasta was going to come out late because they never prepped it. He originally told them 20 minutes and he came back later and said it would take even longer. I think this place would only be good if you were drunk or thought Peter Pipers Pizza was gourmet!"}
{"text":"Wings were good, but I only got one piece of carrot and one piece of celery with my order of 10 wings."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. I was really hoping to find a decent cheesesteak. The delivery was within an appropriate time, but the food was still cold. My daughter ordered the loaded skins and they were definitely overcooked. Very dark and crispy around the edges. The cheesesteak, which was supposed to be thinly sliced ribeye, well it was just sad. They seriously should consider more meat or a smaller roll."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Tailgaters with a big group and the staff and service was excellent every time. The table was all set up and ready for us even though we came earlier as scheduled. Michael, the waiter was superb. He was fast, efficient and very friendly and accommodating. The food was fine, nothing special, that's why I only  give it 4 star rating. But the service deserves 5 stars. We will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Had to give them 1 Star. We walked in and there was a hostess there but she never greeted my family. We waited a few minutes to give her a chance but nothing. Customer Service is not a priority here. We walked out and went to Booty's right next door where we greeted right away.  It's a shame because we really wanted to try it. To the owner.... who ever was working the door at 1:30ish pm on 4/22/18 needs to greet customers."}
{"text":"Normally I don't post bad thing about places but when you go somewhere for beer you would think that the cocktail waitress would do her job and serve me beer.  These was our hang out for awhile but we took a break because of summer.  I have never had service these bad anywhere. I know how this line of work is and the only way you make money it to take care of you guest. I did this job for 10 year and never have I had this shitty of serivce.  The bartender was great but the waitress...  if I could give it a negative I would"}
{"text":"Great experience here! Service was good, timing was perfect, and food was delicious! My family and I were in search of a place with good wings, I'm very happy we found Tailgater's. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was there Saturday for UFC event- poor service from making us wait when there where open tables to the drinks that where very light and took forever to get. What's the deal with having prego servers? There was like 2 and another one behind the bar- I get they want to work as much as they can but come on. Been to this spot many many times and never had this experience. I give the food a 3 star-"}
{"text":"My husband and I love, love, love Tailgaters.  Its the best we've found so far in Surprise and come here all the time when we're home.  If you want fast service, then go to McDs.  I'm in love with the nachos and pretty much all of their items.  Super crowded on Friday nights after work so we go early."}
{"text":"Great service and food the first time I came here. The wings were amazing. The manager was awesome. The second time I sat at the bar and had good service as well."}
{"text":"Been here a few times usually with a small group of friends after work. They have a really large bar area and I love the outdoor patio. The drink selection is decent and they are pretty fairly priced. The food is a bit pricey, servings are small, and it is just not that eventful-have had wings, potatoes, and pizza. There are many things to keep you occupied from multiple TV screens, trivia, etc. My biggest issue is although the servers are all friendly service can be painfully slow. I would definitely not recommend this if you were looking for an easy in easy out lunch."}
{"text":"Granted I came on a Wednesday night...  This appears to be a local hang out for people who are local and not much else."}
{"text":"I have been going every Sunday with a friend for over 3 months and the food is fine the atmosphere is fine buy the manager  Rick needs to be fired and not work with any other humans or deal with customer service maybe a job in the wilderness suits him best."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Terrible service ! You have to flag down a waitress if you want help or a order. Then the waitress acts as if your putting them out . I was also watching a football game on a one TV in front of me that I came an hour ahead of time to watch and all of a sudden this person three seats away said he wanted to watch a different game and they waiter changed it for them. When I complained the waiter who was white said sorry I can't change it back. When I asked why he said it was rules of the house. 

They never changed back !!!  FYI , the other group was white and we were Hispanic . I guess the wrong color for this place. Very prejudice place I found it to be. 

Never going back. Hispanics beware they don't like our kind. 

Amazing, I thought this was the 20 Century .

Wow .  Unbelievable  !  Then upon leaving and getting my bill The waiter over charged me on my bill. Of course now I have two charges on my bank account when I asked for one to be deleted they said it would go through at the end on night when they close. I've heard that before. Now I have to dispute the charge and get another debt card issued . This place is joke !!!! Left totally stressed out about my bank and charges I have to fight over now. 

Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich and beer.  The waitress recommended the French dip made in a pizza crust.  It was so, so good!  Also requested tartar sauce to go with our fries and they offer there home made tartar sauce - best I've ever had too many places make it with sweet pickles I happen to love it with dill pickles - tailgaters makes it perfect!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The cheese curds are delicious! We love eating here. The service is alway awesome and beer is always cold! French dip and the Italian sub are one of our favorites to get! The Beer club is pretty exciting too. I still have half the card to try."}
{"text":"I had posted a review before and it was not flattering. After about 2 years the wife and I decided to give this place another try. Glad we did. It was much better than our last failed visit. We even went back 2 more times. The food has been 'good for this area'. Its bar food but then this is a bar so that should not be a surprise. Still have not tried the pizza here. Maybe next time. Service is great but then we seem to come at off times so it's not been very busy while we were there. This place is worth checking out in my opinion."}
{"text":"Take out order:
Something happened within the past couple of months, because this has changed, and not for the better!  
Our order was:
Ultimate Nachos with Beef:  We received a tin full of chips with little toppings drizzled over the top, very little beef.  (this used to be a great meal, that the kids loved, full of toppings and flavor, but not any more)
Fried Zucchini:  Large portion (great!), sent with sour cream (why?), double battered (why?) and no seasoning.  It was so bland! and so much batter! Pretty terrible.
Child Spaghetti:  This was the only decent dish in the order, but Babbo's is better.

So we won't be going back to this place that we used to enjoy."}
{"text":"Horrible service when you sit at the bar, unless you are a regular. I waited 10 minutes just for a bartender to say hi and get a drink. After a shift change the next bartender never came and asked how my food was, or if I would like another beer, I had to find another waitress just to get a refill and to getting check when I was ready to leave"}
{"text":"We had the burger 2 for 1 special today, it was really good! We had a great waitress, she was friendly and checked on us often! The fries were exceptionally good and hot. We go to Papa Murphys a lot right across from here but never stopped in here, I see they have pizza too so hopefully that will be good too! Some other unique things on menu like a baked Rueben, so anxious to try it! I'm happy they have dining away from the bar, lots of TVs to watch sports in all areas as well!  Love that they have specials on days of the week. We will be coming back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Husband and I went last night for happy hour and had a great experience.  From start to finish: we were greeted immediately.  The place was packed so there was a little wait.  While we waited, we were asked by two other staff members if we had been helped, which was awesome.  I was observing how the servers spoke to the hostesses and happy to see they were kind, not rude at all.  The hostesses jumped right in to help clear tables, wipe them down, grab a pizza box for one of the servers, and always carried a smile on their faces.  Once seated, we were greeted by our server right away.  He had a ton of personality, very friendly, attentive, and didn't hold back on the ranch.  It's a pet peeve of mine when I ask for \"a lot of ranch\" and they bring me one container... which this server did not.  He was kind and gave us just enough for our meals.  Food was delivered hot.  We ordered appetizers for happy hour: spinach dip, fried zucchini, potato skins, and nachos.  All of which was delish, but the spinach dip and friend zucchini are hands down the best in Surprise.  My husband devoured the nachos.  All for a great happy hour price.  This is now going to be our regular spot... and we were excited to hear that they host UFC fights with NO COVER. Next fight in March we are going to Tailgaters."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to tailgaters. We came in and ordered takeout. We ordered an order of 10 boneless wings. It took 25 minutes to get our order.. Then when we get home, I open the box and there are 8 tiny pieces of chicken. They were the worse tasting wings I have ever eaten. I ate two and threw the rest in the trash!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Getting worse and worse. When I complained about A disappointing appetizer I was scolded by the manager and told I didn't understand what I had ordered. They seem to care less about their customers and more about gossiping with fellow staff. There are too many great places in surprise to waste my money and time at this place."}
{"text":"Brought my boys in for lunch today. It has been a while since i've seen such excruciatingly slow service...to the point where we almost left several times during the course of our visit. I wanted to give this place a fair shake though so I sat it out. I'm not sure how this place is for dinner but lunch is not the time to give this place a visit. 

The food was just meh. My older son had an 8in pizza that was alright. I had a buffalo chicken salad that was meh. My youngest had the cheeseburger sliders that were actually a good size and seemed pretty good. But boy was the service s....l....o.....w. Drinks took a while to get refilled. Food took forever to come out. It was like watching paint dry. 

I might go back for an evening with friends just to see what it's like in the evening but I can tell you that I WILL NOT go back at lunch time."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for over a year...the service this last month or so has gone down hill.  Bartender stuck fingers in one of our drinks and when told about it owner was rude and confrontational...it's sad because the food generally is pretty good but the worst management I have ever experienced, made us feel like we did something wrong.  After asking to replace the drink he came outside and stared us down.  Unfortunately we will not be back!  There are plenty of other places with nice patios to go to and enjoy great service and good food!"}
{"text":"Shea is the best bartender in surprise hands down. Not a more hard working bartender in surprise, pregnant, short staffed and still on her feet with a month to go until delivery. This place has a fantastic happy hour, military discount on ALCOHOL! The food is so so, but the drinks are the best deal in the area. I wouldn't come here if shea wasn't here regardless of the deals, she's a fantastic bartender. Always remembers you regulars."}
{"text":"Bartenders are excellent! They actually stop to chat, which is refreshing in speed well service! Food is good, lots of choices. Hostess stand seems to be a little slow, but still a great place in Surprise."}
{"text":"I came to tailgaters tonight with my cousin after getting off at work. We had a server named steph, we ordered 20 wings and two 8 inch pizzas it came out pretty quickly. We paid for our bill in advanced because we wanted to catch a movie after so we're eating our food and our server doesn't come to check on us or do a 3minute bite check not to mention it's completely dead in here she had like 3 tables other than us and they already had their food. Not sure if it was because we are young looking and she just stereotyped us as not tipping her, which is funny cause we are servers ourselves at native grill and wings. We come here all the time so it was disappointing to see that just cause we paid for our bill in advanced that somehow meant we are not to be checked on or served anymore."}
{"text":"Mmmm.....can't talk, too busy eating these AMAZING honey hot wings. Ranch is fantastic and burgers are good too, but a tip for the wise...order them more rare than you want them. Also, great place to watch the UFC fights FREE!"}
{"text":"Service is slow but the waitresses are always friendly.

Tonight service was better.  I only had one drink, it was fair price.  My friend kept raving about how great beer drink was.  Our waitress was training another girl.  That trainee is going to make a lot of money bc she was so sweet.  Just loved her personality.

I didn't eat tonight but I do enjoy the food.  Especially the philly sandwich.

I recommend this place for food & decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Good food, consistently horrible service.   For the third time being ignored by waitstaff, our patience is exhausted."}
{"text":"I have been to Tailgaters a few different times now and I foresee it becoming one of my regular spots. Their service is a little slow, the servers are friendly and polite.  

They seem to have a special written on the white board in front of the hostess table every day.  I went on a Wed once and it was buy one burger get one free.  The burger was pretty good too!  They also had a pizza special that night. Pizza is my favorite entree on their menu. I normally don't eat the crust, but in this case, I couldn't let it go to waste."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and actually thought I written a review before? Really thought they were crazy when they opened up right next to Booty's. They offer a wider menu then Booty's, and is a lot less noisier! Me and some fam were here a couple of times this past weekend. Their food was great, and service was just as good. i had their BBQ burger, only issue I had was there was no BBQ sauce on the burger? But the burger was still good, the next day we all shared a large garlic, tomato, and pepperoni pizza. This was very good as well. I will still continue to go next door for their wings. But tailgaters is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here because we had horrible service at Booty's. Almost no wait. Great customer service. Hostess was great! Our waitress Nikki was excellent! The food was very good! Thank you Tailgaters for saving the night! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Was served dirty mushrooms and gotta hair in my fries! Disgusting! Will stick to drinking here unless they keep having crappy bands come play on the weekends."}
{"text":"Not the best service. Food wasn't the best wings were a hot mess like they were swimming in a sea of bad sauce and they only came with one carrot and one celery. The veggies on my supreme pizza were till raw even after we asked them to put it back in the oven for a few mins!  and even when we spoke to the manager he made up excuses with no apology whatsoever."}
{"text":"The wings were actually pretty good, but the portions were super small. 

For the most part, the food in general tasted pretty good all around the board.

Service was great. Had the dude with the bald head and the curly q mustache."}
{"text":"For starters, Bloody Mary's at happy hour were $3.50 for a real sized glass, not the tumbler/half drink situation. Very happy about that. It was a seat yourself  situation which is what I prefer. Not stacked on top of someone else. Short order menu. Food was very good, place was clean, drinks priced right as were the entree's. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"What in the world?! 16 taps....8 empty. 2 beer coolers.....not enough beer to fully stock one. No coconut rum.....which is a bar staple, even if it is bottom of the barrel. Bartender was too busy playing on the touch screen to care about customers. A PATRON BEHIND THE BAR MAKING DRINKS?! Again....what in the world?!?!?!"}
{"text":"We came here to watch football when we walked in had no idea where to sit we see a table and the waitress says that table is to big. We sit at a table not close to a game we wanted to watch as another couple comes in and sits at the table we were told not to sit at. Very frustrating to say the least. We ordered nachos they were not bad just seems the service is really poor here."}
{"text":"Decent food been coming here a couple of times and it hasn't been bad the food is food the drinks are a little different depending on who is at the bar but it's an all right place"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.  The food was disgusting. I started with the smallest, greasiest potato skins I've ever had. And for some reason it took at least 20 minutes to get them. Then it took another 20 minutes and asking two different waitresses three different times for a side of ranch (with only 4 or 5 tables of people in the whole place). I only got the ranch when my \"meal\" came out and the skins were by then cold. The burger was a dried up little piece of meat on a bun twice its size with no mustard/mayor or any condiment whatsoever. The club sandwich was so greasy I needed a napkin to pick it up. It had only one shaved piece of turkey and one shaved piece of ham on it with four pieces of bread. All you could taste was grease and bread. I may have been able to tolerate the horrible food if the service had been tolerable. The waitress (and the other ones waiting tables on the other side) where moving at the pace of a herd of turtles. Our waitress was anything but friendly. When we said this is our first time here, She said \"okay\" and walked away without offering recommendations. My drink sat empty for at least 30 minutes before she came around and then actually asked if I needed a refill and acted surprised that I said yes.  All we wanted was the heck out, but of course getting the check took forever as well. She came to the two tables behind us several times but never even looked our way most of the time we were there. We over heard the manager apologizing to the table behind us for the bad food and wait times, but never even looked our way either. I'll be watching this place to appear of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares w/Gordon Ramsey! This place doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Tailgaters has become a regular place for my family and I.  This location has a great bar area, covered outdoor seating, a fairly large indoor dining area and good parking.  

I have eaten several items off the menu and never been disappointed.  They make their own blue cheese and italian dressings which are great!  The pizza is awesome and always consistent.   You can order almost any of their sandwiches \"baked\" which is the way to go.  They put all of the sandwich ingredients in a pocket of pizza dough and bake it, they're awesome.  
They have a really good selection of draft beers and it's always cold.  I really enjoy their \"beer club card\" program which seems to be somewhat an insider's secret since I never really see them advertise it.  If you plan on going to Tailgaters a lot ask them for a beer card.  The card has about 40 different beers, bothe tap and bottle, on it and several \"chose your own\" boxes.  If you drink all the beers they give you a free shirt and you get your name on the plaque.  It's a fun way to try different beers.  

I give them 4 stars because they seem to have a fair ammount of turnover with the bartenders and servers which makes the service hit or miss.  They also have a ton of TV's but I have been there a few times to watch Suns games and they don't even have it on.  They always change the TV's when asked, so not that big of a deal but they definitely prefer to play music rather than the sound of some of the sporting events.

The bartenders are somewhat friendly but definitely seem to cater more to the regulars which seem to be the older, retiree age gentlemen.  I don't really mind since I don't sit at a bar by myself.  However, my wife and I have sat at the bar together quite often and no matter how many times we get the same bartender it's like she is seeing us for the first time.    

I would, and have, recommend this place and bring friends or family here."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I order at the bar. Sasha is the best bar tender in the joint. She always gets my drink right, sometimes I don't even have to order. The only bad thing about this place is, I always see the same people. Guess I can't blame the place as it is located in bum fuk Egypt. LoL. If you want good drinks, and a good time come here, but bring your own friends. LoL."}
{"text":"The food was good and so was that atmosphere, but I could have done without all the waitresses boobs in my face.  They need to cover up a bit more since it is a family establishment."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The grilled chicken is a nice portion and moist . The pizza is crispy and tasty.  A different special every night and the kids love the food and and I love the prices."}
{"text":"Service was great! We were seated right away. Wife & I came here to eat wings, have some cold beverages and watch the race. Not a very popular sport this far from the east coast. Nevertheless they had it showing on a few of the many tv's surrounding the place. Service was Great we never had to look for our waitress. She came around many times. My beer was nice & COLD! The food was just a little better than ok. Which is why I couldn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in Wed. afternoon with the kids (11 & 12) for a bite after doing some errands. It's loud here, but that's the kind of place it is. The day's special, X-L pizza w/ 1 topping was $10. It was about a 16 inch and pretty good. We left full and took half home. We will definitely come back to try more off the menu. Lots of daily specials and happy hour/bar hour discounts. Worth the first try, and a second."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great service and atmosphere with good deals and descent bar food, they will even do grilled wings."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings. I enjoy coming here and having a great time with friends and family!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was fast.  The only negative about my experience there was too much salt in my Bloody Mary.  I will definitely come back for their good burgers."}
{"text":"I received the worst service in Surprise at this establishment. I've worked in the restaurant industry as a server for 3 years so I understand when you get busy but our server was not busy. We saw Michael a total of two times. This is when he introduced himself and then when he took our order. Someone else brought out our food. He never refilled our drinks. I had to find him to pay. Won't be returning. 2 stars because the blonde hostess working Friday night (the 23rd of September) was very friendly and recommended items on the menu.

The most disappointing is that I saw Michael giving great service to other tables. I felt as if Michael assumed we would be bad tippers because I appear to be young and I brought in my little brother. That's the only way I can explain the service I received compared to his other tables. I hope there is another explanation."}
{"text":"The food was deelish, the manager was great but the service could've been better. 
Took my 3 daughters there for a late dinner after a pinup outing. We were seated at a table & waited several minutes but a server never came to greet us yet we saw a few helping other guest. I finally decided to go to the bar & ask if we could have someone help us. Promptly a lovely brunette came, apologized & explained she wasn't assigned to wait on our table. I then asked if the person who was supposed to wait on us was on break to which she replied \"No, she's right there\" & pointed her out. Keep in mind, the blond woman she pointed out passed our table at least 5 times while we were waiting, made eye contact with me at least twice that I noticed yet not once acknowledged us not even with a passing friendly smile. According to my teen it was because she was a \"hater\" which is quit believable considering she was VERY friendly to the older, bulky shaped, older men. 
Anywho, after our server came back with our drinks we placed an order for a pizza & wing special. We sat chatting for almost 10 minutes when a man brought out our hot wings. We were excited, they appeared to be cooked to our specifications & smelled tasty. Please note at this point we had not been given any plates, napkins or silverware so we were expecting them to be delivered along with the pizza any minute now. SEVERAL minutes passed since the wings came out & still no pizza and now we all had gulped down our drinks being famished yet no one came to offer refills. About 15-16 minutes after our wings came out the previous man came to our table with our pizza. I stopped him before he could go back to the kitten & asked why our wings came out long before our pizza even though we had ordered them together as a special. The man seamed irritated & stated they don't come out together unless we request it when ordering. I was confused... we ordered them together at the same time as a special so why on earth would the 2 items not be served together? I then advised him we were expecting to eat the 2 items together but now our wings were cold since we had to wait so long for the pizza to come out. He then offered to \"reheat\" the wings :-/ Uhhh... NO. Who wants microwaved food at a restaurant? So I then asked for the manager. By the way, the manager was apologetic, explained that shouldn't have happened, had yet another server bring us more drinks, supplied us with plates/silverware himself & placed a rush order for fresh wings (which took about 5 minutes to come out). We haven't been back since because of the service from the wait staff and kitchen but the food was tasty and the manager was so very pleasant"}
{"text":"Food is not good. Wings were dry and they serve them in a pool of fatty sauce. The beer selection is alright, but it wasn't very cold. Ordered chicken nachos, they put beef based chili on them and it didn't appear to state that on the menu. There are better choices but all in all the place is a big disappointment. I don't think you should have to ask if they are going to put beef, on chicken nachos and when I questioned the waitress she said that all nachos have chili on them, like I was from Mars. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Went there Saturday night with my sister and my three kids. The server was very attentive and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Foods okay, but their service rrally sucks. There's a sign to seat yourself, but why would i seat myself after placing a pick-up order? They will literally leave you standing there as they walk back and forth looking at you like you can't read the sign... why offer pick-up orders if you can't seem properly train your staff to take care of those paying customers? Even as a dine-in customer you will wait at your table for about 15 minutes before anyone comes to greet you and take your drink order. Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"The absolute WORSE service ever! Every time we go there is only ONE server or at best 2 for the entire place. This is the 3rd time now! 
Although I can understand a server's frustration that is no excuse to take it out on customers! The only talked blonde is absolute ass! She is ALWAYS very short and inattentive. She has the worse attitude for someone in the service industry. 
We've decided they'll never get another dime. Our party of 6-10 will be going to Booty's where they know how to treat people. The low happy hour prices is not worth the bs service."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fun atmosphere, and wonderful service at the bar. Prices are very fair and they have a good Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely a great sports bar! A sports bar with great food, not mediocre food- from the salads to wings to nachos to pizza! So far, I haven't been let down! And our server, Sierra, was awesome!"}
{"text":"This review is for a mid-afternoon visit on 2/27/13...

Disappointing.  This pretty much sums up our experience.  It was our first time at Tailgaters and short of something monumental happening, it will be our last.

The decor is ok, it screams pizza joint turned sports bar.  This works out and will be great come summer when trying to find a cool, dark place to get out of the heat.  The restroom was clean and interestingly, the only place where I learned of the daily specials (they were posted on the wall by the sinks) after we ordered (the waitress never said a word about them and we didn't see them anywhere in the actual bar/restaurant area).

It's all a downhill review from here so if you are looking for reasons to go, stop reading now!

We entered the place to find two people standing at the front desk and a sign reading \"please seat yourself.\"  While the two holding the desk up appeared to acknowledge our presence, we were not greeted.  We selected a table away from the crowd in the bar because all the high tops appeared to be for larger groups and we were there to have a late lunch not get sh*t-faced on happy hour specials...

The first person to approach us might have been a manager and seemed concerned about how long we had been sitting without attention.  The main man asked about the on-tap selection as he thought a beer would taste good on the lovely spring day (remember we were primarily there for lunch not booze).  This guy didn't know the beer selection at all and went to the bar to bring us a list conjured up in some word processing program (not a formal menu).

He dumps this paper on us then disappears.  A few seconds later a different guy, clearly staff, appears and asks if we are ready to order.  We ask for menus and water and he disappears.  Within seconds we get a waitress who asks if she can get our drink order.  The main man orders a Kiltlifter and she zooms away from the table; I have to holler at her that I'd like whatever diet soda they have... This is the first time she seems to even notice I'm there.  My husband is a very handsome man but he isn't Brad Pitt!

She brings the drinks, in two separate trips, and we have to stop her from zipping off again to order.  She seems pretty put out by the fact that we want food off the menu and not just stuff from the Happy Hour app menu.

We get the HH quesadilla, the turkey bacon melt, and the bacon cheeseburger (ordering the cheeseburger should have been a moment where she could have offered the two-for-one burger special but she didn't).

The quesadilla arrives, it looks nice, the tortilla is perfectly grilled, but it's just plain cheese inside.  No seasoning, nothing special.  It is exactly as it reads in the menu and exactly what my 7 year old niece would make if I asked her for a cheese quesadilla.  

Our waitress cruises the table and inquires about the quesadilla.  When the man says \"it's ok\" she responds by asking if he wants another beer (he's not even halfway through the original 16 oz).  When he says no, she zips away agin (I'm out of water and could use a soda refill but she apparently can't be bothered with such trivial matters).

The food arrives and our immediate reaction is WTF????  The turkey bacon melt is made with bacon bits and chopped turkey that falls right out of it the minute he picks it up.  It tastes ok but again, my niece could pull this off...  The burger is damn near slider sized and literally hiding in a bun twice the size of the meat patty.  It had two actual slices of bacon and tasted decent but again no seasoning and it was within my the abilities of my niece.  The fries weren't worth eating, pretty sure they came from a bag in the freezer.

As we are eating, the waitress speeds past and asks how things are and again, the man says \"it's ok\" and she responds with \"want another beer?\"  When he says no, she's gone again (still no refills of water or soda).

We finish and pile our dishes and the waitress comes and removes them only now asking if I'd like any refills.  When I respond no, she takes all but one plate and disappears.  And we wait.... And wait...

Has anything about our visit indicated we want to spend one more minute in this place?  Our beverages are gone and we have declined more, the food that was edible is gone and we haven't ordered more, by my count, this is when the bill usually arrives.  Nope, we have to wave her down and ask for the bill and she seems genuinely surprised that we want out... She never smiled, she never greeted us, she never refilled beverages (only asking when the man clearly hadn't had enough alcohol for the food to be better than ok and after the meal was over), she never gave us a reason to stay.  

Not one thing about our visit gives us a reason to go back.

Save yourself the frustration of lackluster service by personnel that look more like biker-bar parolees than professional servers and marginal food.  Go elsewhere, anywhere, but not there."}
{"text":"Way better service this time. Our waitress was very attentive and it was a very busy day. She didn't skip a beat even though the restaurant was packed with people watching the final four basketball game. Our appetizers came out quick and was cooked perfect. There were no leftovers. Our pizza came out about 10 minutes later and again was cooked to perfection.  My only negative of today's experience was with the hostesses. Every time we come they care more about talking to each other than greeting people and saying hello. When that's your primary aspect of your job you should be great at it."}
{"text":"Great food! I went at a busy time, even though it was supper time when I went we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for a table and we didn't wait long on the food. The waitress also noticed when we were low on beer. All in all our with our service you wouldn't even know it was busy there."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, all of it! I have never had anything I didn't like and I am picky. The service needs some improvement, there are a lot of mix ups and it seems mismanaged. I'll still be back!"}
{"text":"Wings were good and pizza was ok. Good prices but slow service and waitress did not know what was on draft. Not sure if we went during a special happy hour thing or what, but lots of drunk vulgar people at 8 pm. 
Would go again maybe at lunch but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Meh. That's the overall consensus. A lot of their food feels really boxed to me. And why does everything have to have a hot sauce base? I ordered Parmesan garlic wings and figured I would get a buttery wing like back home, but they were buffalo? Don't understand. My boyfriend got a barbecue burger where the barbecue was laced with hot sauce too. Hot sauce doesn't make everything better people. Luckily we can take heat but otherwise I can see where someone would be super upset about that. Not only that but we both had stomach aches later that night. On top of that it was some kind of trivia night and the speakers were so loud I couldn't even hold a conversation and he was 2 ft away. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This was a surprise night out with the family. We sampled the pizza, wings, pasta and beer (of course). Prices were good and food was great. Service was excellent by a Kansas fan."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant I've visited in years. Here's a list why:
*The service was painfully slow
*our waitress was short, didn't tell us her name, and was rude.
*we ordered four entrees and an appetizer; the waitress FROGOT to put in our appetizer, they brought out two entrees, then 15 minutes later the other two, which were cold. Then after another 10 minutes our appetizer finally arrived.
*it took 45 to get the first two entrees.
*it took us 25 minutes to get our check, our waitress kept looking RIGHT AT US, then turning and walking the other direction, even when I said VERY loudly \"excuse me\". She totally ignored us.
*We had to ask a totally different waitress for our check and when I went to get her attention she rolled her eyes and was REALLY snarky.
Overall horrible experience and I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE. And the food was bad too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an affordable restaurant where your whole family is welcome...stop by tailgaters!

Great food, huge beer selection, great happy hour prices and most importantly superb customer service. This is my \"Cheers\" bar. 

You'll always be greeted with a smile and the GM will stop by your table and make sure you have a great experience. Family friendly environment."}
{"text":"Place is horrible for delivery. My wife's mom from LA was staying at our house and ordered a meatball sub from there for delivery and it never showed up. She called back and they said they lost her order. We decided to try them again tonight. We placed an order for delivery. Guess what it never showed up. we had to call them back and ask about our order. While giving the order the girl on the other end kept asking over and over whats our name, our address, and what we want. She said sorry it was loud in here. Well come to find out that they placed our order under a wrong name and our address was wrong. By time we received our order it was cold. Our order was completely wrong. When we called back for a third time to talk with a manager again he seemed like he was in a rush. I will NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. ignorant people working here and all they care about is getting orders out and not customer service."}
{"text":"We have been going to tailgaters for a while now. Always have had good experience . usually have Jennifer a server. just love her!!! Would love to work with her again"}
{"text":"The place is very loud. The tiny Wings were cold and sopping wet with a very nasty wing sauce.  Bbq pizza was ruined by the \"bbq\" sauce that was on it.  Calzone had a lot of bread and almost no filling.  I have been drug to this place on multiple occasions and every time it was a let down.  The staff is nice and helpful. But they could use some help with their food."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town, friendly staff, great pizza, better than anywhere wings."}
{"text":"Had their pizza last night at Pickleball function. It was very good. Super large pizzas that served well over a hundred people. Most people comments that it was really good. Thanks.  Rvt"}
{"text":"We love tailgaters! It's our favorite restaurant in Surprise! There food is yummy, from the pizza and wings to there baked subs, fish fry and burgers, you can't go wrong! The staff is very friendly and the margaritas are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  My family loves going to tailgaters to get great pizza and watch a variety of sports of one of their many tvs"}
{"text":"My friend walked in to the bar and got harassed by customers. She felt very uncomfortable. Never go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch UFC fights! Friendly bartenders! More modern than Booty's, staff is more attentive than their next door competition."}
{"text":"We came out of here happy again.  Karaoke was playing, plenty of TVs for entertainment and most importantly a filled bar and restaurant.  
The pizza is great, thin crust, stringy cheese, and a nice crispness to the ham on top of out pizza.  It was a extra large for a discounted price of 9.99.  Enough for 4 adults and we still took about half home.  
The 2 for 1 burger deal was going on so 2 burgers for 8.99 is a steal.  A BBQ burger comes on a nice toasted bun.  Just toasted enough to hold the meat, cheese, onion rings, bacon, and BBQ sauce all together.  It is a big burger and the toasted bun makes it stay together with 1 hand.  I do ask you request more BBQ, since mine was barely coated with sauce.  The fries were fresh, right amount of salt, and plenty of cat-sup to enjoy the steak cut fries.  
Karaoke is not my thing, but it is great to watch people sing.  Great entertainment and      even some employees get involved to keep it going.  
Go check it out for yourself, I am sure the other places near by are losing business."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and the burgers are to die for. Cold beer and 50+ TVs. This is my regular spot for now on. If you don't come it's better for me. Always Busy"}
{"text":"Friday night, sat in the patio area, food was great.  Pleasantly surprised by the brats and sauerkraut.  Pitchers are reasonable, and the other three in my party enjoyed their food.  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband an I tried it a couple times, thinking the service sucked because they were busy and new but no that doesn't seem to be the case . Service sucks! Even when you sit at the bar in FRONT of the bartenders that hate their jobs you still get overlooked...we practically had to go behind the bar and get our own drink...I don't think anyone working there understands what customer service is! Especially when your working for tips.....don't waste your time or money ..we won't ever again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for pizza and wings! Nothing compares! Always comes out hot, fresh and consistent and we love it! The price is right and the service is always good!"}
{"text":"Where to start.... We were seated and then waited a 10-12 min to even be greeted... We have a almost 2 and almost 1 year old so this was way to long to wait... then for our drinks we waited another 5-7... I should also mention that there were several servers who walked past us and no one even noticed we had no been greeted... And our server Autumn not once apologized for the wait and kind of had that \"what do you want\" kind of attitude... Our food was deliver by the what we think was the manager who didn't seem to care too much that we had been waiting for awhile either... To top it all off when the air came on it really came on... We were freezing which made the rest of our food cold... We had the nachos and the meatball sandwich I give the nachos a 5 and boyfriend gives the sandwich a 7... not the best visit not sure we would go back... Although I would say if we did go back we would look for the one server we did see be attentive and greeted and got drinks for her tables quickly and friendly something we did not receive during this visit... We do give Autumn some credit cause we are both servers and we did see she had a big party who was already sat before we were but where she lacked in the timing she could of made up with friendliness..."}
{"text":"This is one of our must go back to places!  Spinach salad, burgers , nachos...  all sooo good
Never had their pizza yet, but I see a lot of pizzas being brought out ( soon to be tried!)
Their happy hour is one of the best!
See you soon 
Thank you MO and the other servers we have had over the months"}
{"text":"Second time I have been, we arrived for a late lunch on 7/13/13.  Place was pretty empty, but the bar area was very loud.  There is no physical separation from the bar and the dining area, so it will alawys be noisey.

The decor is VERY dark.  It is not a bright place, and you feel more like you are in a dingy pub.  By the time we ordered drinks, 2 other waitresses had come by asking if we had been served yet.  

While this restaurant appears to be suffering from really bad service, I saw the worst example of service ever.  A waitress was hitting on a guy, and would sit in his booth for 5 to 10 minutes at a time.  The manager? finally came over to let her know that her other customers were asking for her.

Which is how I felt about our waiter.  Inattentative, and unconcerned.  There were almost as much staff as customers, but they couldn't check up on us.  I ended up going to the wait station to get napkins and flagged down miscellaneous staff to get us refills."}
{"text":"The bar has nice decor and I have met the manager, who seems very kind. My biggest complaint is about a bartender who works there. I have been there about four times and she has made me my favorite drink. I went in last night and asked for the same drink she makes me every time I am there and she told me she didn't have all the ingredients to make the drink and that she had never made it in her life. She also said to me rudely, that this was a beer and a shot kind of place, putting me down for ordering a drink with 3 ingredients. I wasn't asking her to muddle up mint leaves squeeze fresh limes in the drink. I just feel like customers should be treated with respect, and none was given. Not a smile, not a hello, not anything positive. She was very rude."}
{"text":"We love this place. They give one of the biggest military discounts. And we took our son here for his birthday. They gave him a huge brownie/ w whipped cream and ice cream. He loved it and we loved it. We get the house calzon and the salad with buffalo chicken. But, everything we have here is amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place and wings. Staff is always upbeat and welcoming. To go orders  are always timely. My top place to watch NFL games. Usually good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! It's far more than the pizza and wings!! The top sirloin is their specialty"}
{"text":"The pizza may be cheesy but this place isnt! Bootys watch out! Tvs and fun everywhere! Delilah is awesome and remembered my bleu cheese! A+ for sure!"}
{"text":"The music is way too loud and the pizza somewhat cold so stick with the wings and pasta.  Veronica makes it worth the meal."}
