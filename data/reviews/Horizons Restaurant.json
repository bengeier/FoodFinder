{"text":"Came recently with a small group. The food was fine, with lots of vegetables and nice plating, but they messed up my order twice, which I think is ridiculous for the price. Also, I'm pretty sure the whipped cream on our dessert was actually one of those oil products ... it just tasted too artificial.   While the decor is dated, the view is still amazing. Maybe  a better place to just grab an appetizer and a drink than a full meal."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this restuarant. We have had an excellent experience in 360, but Horizon really let us down.  We felt like we were a burden to our server Donald. After arriving at the relatively empty restaurant,  we waited at our table for five or so minutes before going to the bar to request or drinks, thinking that you ordered and paid at the bar and there was no table service. The bartender expressed frustration that we haven't been served and yelled across the restuarant to the waiter that we wanted drinks .   When Donald arrived with our drinks he seemed very put-out. So much so that I felt like I should apologize to him for having ordered from the bar (Wait a minute,  why an I apologizing to my waiter for poor service? ).  I made an effort the break the ice, but to no avail.  The next time he stopped by was not to ask if we would like anything else,  but to bring us our check.   At this point we felt pretty unwelcome,  but we wanted to enjoy our time in the CN Tower and didn't want to let this ruin our night.  We waited to request a second drink, which he unenthusiasticly obliged. When he returned he threw our glasses down and left us.  When he returned it was not to ask us if we needed anything,  but to being us our check (a pattern has emerged.) After about ten minutes we saw our waiter again, but this time he was informing us that it was dinner time and we should go.    My girlfriend was pretty pissed.  We came down to have a couple of drinks and desert after enjoying 360, and we got treated like unwelcome pests.  There were at least 3 empty tables in sight and every step of the way our server acted like our patronage was an imposition. It's the little things.  Throwing the plate and drinks on the table so they slide about a half inch after he let's go of them.  Not asking if we want anything else before he brings the bill. Grabbing the extra cutlery off the table like we were going to steal it or something.  Next time I'll grab a soda and candy bar from the vending machine and sit on the glass floor."}
{"text":"So bad. We are muslims and we came here and ordered Cesar Salad without pork... Then they brought it and we asked if there was pork and said no.... We started eating and then while eating we found out that there is pork inside.... I dont understand why they did that... They apologized but still charged us for the rest of our food... So bad dont come here"}
{"text":"Doesn't require reservations like 360 does, so it was nice spontaneously walking in and getting a window seat. (There were a few window seats left on a Saturday afternoon)  The food isnt cheap, but the portions are pretty big. And the quality of the food was perfect.   Knocked off a star because it took a while to get a waiter. But our waiter that we actually DID get was VERY sweet :) Too bad a few walked by before him and completely ignored us..."}
{"text":"Went there with my kids for lunch.  I read the reviews beforehand and I already knew the prices before going there.   We got there before 11:30 a.m. and seated ourselves by a window because I didn't see any maître d.  So we sat at a table with a good view of Lake Ontario.  Our waiter was polite and we had no problems with him whatsoever.  He took our order quickly and we got our food fairly quickly.  Other reviewers complained that their server was rude but our server was nice.  He saw I had a lot of kids with me and gave us lots of extra napkins without me having to ask.  About the food.  We ordered pizza, philly sandwich, hamburger and fries and shrimp salad (served in a small bowl).  It was all edible and gobbled up quickly. The lunch cost more than $90 for one adult and 4 kids.  We had to pay admission to get up the CN Tower so this was a pretty expensive lunch outing for the family.  But I guess it was worth it to do it once so I can say to myself that I took my kids somewhere special during the summer holidays.  I enjoyed the lakefront view but I think my son stared more at the Jays game on the TV screen during the lunch. I have to say it was more calm and relaxing to view things from inside Horizon's restaurant (compared to being with the crowds in the Lookout level)."}
{"text":"As I sat here and stared off into the skyline of Toronto, I realized that I had more to live for than just writing bad children's novels. As I sipped on my small (but large priced) coffee, I decided not only could I write children's books. But also children's reviews. So here is my debut. - Coffee was good and so was little ice cream things but too much monies for the foods"}
{"text":"We were wanting to have some food on top of the CN tower. Since 360 was full and we were wanting have a more casual experience we thought we could go with the Horizons Restaurant. Before we climbed up, I asked downstairs for a menu, so we could set expectations. There wasn't a menu displayed downstairs like 360 had. I went online and was able to find it. The prices didn't look bad at all. Entrees ranging between $18-25, with kids options. Prices looked decent and we decided to go up instead of looking for something else.  We walked in, sat at the only available window table. As we glanced at the menu, noticed it was nothing like what we saw online. All entrees are at least $48, with $20+ appetizers. No kids menu. I asked for the manager and said this is not what I expected and I couldn't really walk to another restaurant since I was on top of the tower now. She seemed to be clueless, talked about the summer menu running from June 24th and on, while the site said it ran between May and October. I don't believe the menu on the site is ever used.  Apparently CN Tower management has no control over this place and to me it is technically a scam because you're lured into one thing and trapped to something different once you're committed to it.  Since they posted the price online, they should have honored it.  Most people were only having drinks there anyway. So, buyer beware."}
{"text":"Went to this when we got the edge walk package ... and was very impressed.  The portions are so filling and very fancy for what you'd normally expect to be regular food.  For example one of the foods that required nachos, rather than on the side, the bowl itself was the nacho.  It's a tad bit expensive but not nearly as much as some pretentious places in Toronto would sell it for"}
{"text":"Food was okay, not much selection, had the blt and for Americans this was not a blt. Service was poor but the views are awesome"}
{"text":"I went there on a weekday afternoon and the restaurant was by no means busy. Although somehow I still received perhaps the worst service ever. The server behaved as though he was doing us a favor and wasn't attentive in the slightest. The food was also mediocre, but the service is what left a bad aftertaste. Would not go here again. Really disappointing for a tourist hot spot."}
{"text":"Neither the bartender or the waiter knew what a whiskey sour was.  I don't mean they didn't know how to make it (though they didn't), I'm saying they argued with me, they did not believe it was a cocktail.  ...which is a challenge when you charge twelve bucks for a highball."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a whim while doing the glass floor at the CN tower. Went in for dessert which was excellent. The one issue we had was the coffee was cold, and even after sending it back they still brought out another cold cup. The view is the highlight here obviously, and the atmosphere here is excellent! Definitely recommended, although certainly room for improvement."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit torn on how to review this place. I went here for Winterlicious recently, $23 for lunch + $10 elevator ticket. The value during Winterlicious is great, since it includes the amazing views and a cheeky touristy trip up the CN Tower. The service and food were not so good.  Our server spilled water all over the ground near our table and instead of mopping it up he kicked a few icecubes away and chuckled. This probably would've been acceptable but we were sitting near some steps and it made it very slippery. The hostess nearby noticed, but no action was taken. He later spilled a bunch of water while serving the table behind us, they were seated on carpet, so it wasn't as big a deal, but come on man, pour the water properly!  I had the soup, fish and toffee pudding. My husband had the pork pate, beef, and cheesecake.  My soup was undercooked. The potatoes were still raw and the soup was cold. My husband's appetizer was also cold. It came out alarmingly fast, so it was likely sitting out already.  Our main course took forever to arrive. It came at the same time as entrees for a table that was seated about 20 minutes after us. My husband loved his beef bourguignon, it was tender and super flavourful. My fish on the other hand was so metallic tasting i couldn't finish it. It was really disappointing.  Dessert also too forever to arrive, despite finishing entrees before the aforementioned table we received our dessert well after them. It was tasty, but by that time I just wanted to leave. It had been about 2 hours since we first arrived. The kitchen was unbelievably slow. And for the record it was not that busy. Our reservation was for 11 (opening hours) so we were amount the first group of people seated.  I might go back, but maybe not for several more years when I have another hankering to take a look at the city from up top."}
{"text":"Horizons is a bar and restaurant that is cheaper, has longer hours and a different menu than 360 which is one floor above it in the CN Tower.  The chef and sous chefs are the same for both restaurants.     A big difference is that 360 comes with a free elevator ride, whereas you had to pay general admission to get into Horizons.   That said, you will most likely pay a little less overall for Horizons.   Horizons Restaurant does not rotate like 360, but I kind of like that as well, as your view is panoramic and allows you to feel stationery.    360 absolutely requires a main dish to be purchased by every person at the table, whereas Horizons has no minimum purchase."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant was horrible! We sat at our tables with our menus closed for 15 minutes before having to ask for a server. Even after another 5 minutes, a manager showed up, and we still didn't have a server.   And the kicker was that the restaurant was empty!! Completely disappointing. Go to 360!"}
{"text":"Touristy restaurant. Just to eat on top of a tower with great views. Had a couple of sandwhich / burgers. Bread was dry. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night during March Break. It was pretty busy, and the staff was stretched thin. As a result, service wasn't the best - they weren't rude, just in a rush. The menu options were pretty limited, there wasn't a lot to choose from and the available options weren't anything special. My dad got the margarita pizza and I got the market soup and sandwich. The food was alright, again not anything special.   The selling factor is definitely the view. No matter what time you come, the city is a fantastic to look at - you want to get window seats.   Overall nothing special, a casual place to eat at the tower with a great view."}
{"text":"Nightview is awesome. (Though not facing the financial district) Food is OK. Appetizer for the goat cheese salmon tart is sth I would never try in the future. Pork Rack is not bad."}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch. It was much better that we expected. I had the heirloom tomatoes with feta appetizer and my companion had the need sopes. Both we excellent. Even the price was reasonable considering the location. I have to admit I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised that it was quite good."}
{"text":"Hi you all   So that restaurant is located top of CN tower. This restaurant does not require reservation to have lunch or dinner, hence that would be nice choice for spontaneous decision.   Firstly, it offers one of best sightseeing in city, maybe the best. Horizon restaurant takes up half of the second floor of CN tower. Most of part of restaurant provides lake view, sure there's a part that you could see city view, but it is fewer than lake.   I gotta say I'm impressed by meals they served, which was certainly better than I expected. Surprising part about is speed of service time. Basically, they immediately served the meal, probably in 5 minutes, which is after than lots of restaurant in Toronto. They offer prefix menu that includes appetizer, main course, dessert and beverage etc. I did not pick to go with prefix menu, which allegedly looked to me little bit restricted with array of those meal. So, I got NY steak, soup and dessert and those were definitely tasty.   Verdict: definitely one of best restaurant that I have been through, ( not the best, it's my top 10) sightseeing extremely incredible and breath taking, meals are great for that type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Being hungry while viewing the breathtaking views of Toronto lead a friend and I to have dinner at this restaurant.   I was taken back at first by the find your own seating, but realized this was a smart idea in order for customers to pick their own choice of seating overlooking the sights of Toronto.  We were immediately greeted by a waiter who served us water and showed us our menus, before informing us that we would be served by another person.  Our waitress was kind and asked us if we wanted anything else to drink while we were looking over the menu.   The Spicy Italian Pasta was very filling despite it looking very small to the person eating it. I didn't even notice at first the cheese that was inside the dish, but that added a nice flavor to the pasta. The bacon club sandwich with chicken in it was a large order. I suggest splitting this between a friend as this is large. The sandwich was mouthwatering, and cooked to perfection. The order comes with sweat potato fries, but we opted for traditional fries.   All in all, I was impressed with the quality and vibe of this restaurant. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to the CN Tower and decided to stop for a coffee at the top.   While there's an amazing view and the customer service is great, everything is majorly overpriced and not high quality at all.   Probably won't be coming back if I'm up the CN Tower again."}
{"text":"The second restaurant at the top of the CN Tower, this restaurant features an amazing view, fantastic food, and creates a unique dining experience! However, it took the staff at the restaurant a very long time to seat us when we arrived and we were finally seated 30 minutes after our reservation time. The food was very tasty, but the portions were small for the price. You also need to pay for a lift ticket to get up the tower to even be able to eat at the restaurant. The staff seemed ill prepared and, even though my wife and I largely enjoyed our lunch, there were too many other issues for me to give it a better score.  If you're already planning on going up the tower anyway, this is a fun place to go have a good meal in a more casual atmosphere than 360, the CN Tower's premier restaurant. However, it is not worth going to the CN Tower to eat there in and of itself. I hope I have a reason to upgrade this review later on, perhaps the next time I have a reason to go up the tower again."}
{"text":"We felt like we weren't meant to be there....  Our waiter was barely around...  The restaurant was not busy at all.  He didn't seem like he was overly interested in serving us,  rather just get us in and out. Zero personality....  Less than zero really. Took about 10 minutes for us to have water served and menus.  Seated ourselves... No greating apon our arrival. Not a hello or single acknowledgment of us being there to spend money. Food took about 30 minutes.   I had the tower burger. I was good. But clumsy and messy. Onion rings were great. Not enough for the price. Our bill came to around $45-60   I would not go back. Or recommend this stuck up over priced and sad excuse for a restaurant. I'm glad I didn't tip"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only! We hung out at the bar and had a couple glasses of wine on a Thursday night. The bartender was really nice and chatted us up! We were visiting from LA for a wedding and he told us about stuff to do in Toronto and chatted with us about his life in Toronto and Canadian money and travel. The bar is on the pricy side but that's to be expected at a tourist attraction. We enjoyed our time hanging out with some cocktails and looking at the gorgeous view."}
{"text":"Amazing view of the city, definitely beats Panoroma and Canoe. Horizons is a very classy, quiet but not too quiet( which is good!) restaurant. It has a rounded open concept layout. I'll upload a photo of toronto down below/view we had. It looks like glitter and the prix fixe menu as well.   We got the $32 prix fixe menu( app, main and dessert) we shared it because the portions were pretty large and filling.  App -  Wild Mushroom, Heirloom tomato pizza, perfect for one person. I was stuffed. Tasted really good.   Main - Grilled, boneless chicken bacon club with sweet potato fries, friend loved her sandwhich especially the bacon, couldn't even finish the fries haha.   Dessert - we obviously shared this, the trio. Creme brûlée was so amazing. The 3 flavored were Mexican mango, Jamaican coconut and Colombian coffee. I wish I ordered another one. I'll have to wait till the next time I go to the cn tower to taste that beautiful dessert again."}
{"text":"Just go to 360.  The food was pretty terrible. We had the prix fixe, I had the \"roasted\" chicken and my friend, the salmon. French onion soup was salty, the chicken just greasy yet somehow dry at the same time, definitely overcooked, dry on the edges, as was her salmon. The green beans, however were perfectly cooked. The bread pudding, also delicious.   Service was mediocre. Our server had never tasted the food because when asked for a recommendation between the lamb shank and the chicken, he had no idea.  The view was great. But it's also great at 360 where for a few more dollars, you get an exceptional meal.  $30 pp elevator ride up is not optional, so factor this in."}
{"text":"The view from the tower is breathtaking. The downside is the restaurant. I came here asking for a few dishes I saw from yelp reviews and basically I was told they no longer had any of them. I was really excited for the butter chicken poutine but since that was discontinued I just ordered the Kennebec fries. I didn't realize that that meant just regular fries, which were 7 dollars and a small portion. I had to send the fried back because they were soggy, cold, and saturated with oil. For a establishment like this I expected more. The service was also kind of spotty, it took a while to get our order in and find a waiter. The only plus side of this is the view. Otherwise don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This was one of the most disgusting meals I've ever had in my life. And the service was awful.  I ordered from the Winterlicious menu for lunchtime - $23 - seemed like a good deal. Even with the additional $10 to go up the CN Tower.  The food was cold when it should've been hot, and warm when it should've been cold.  The Rainbow Trout dish was top 3 worst dishes ever. It was inedible. It tasted like everything had gone sour or spoiled. I couldn't eat it.  My friend had a lamb tart that was so overcooked that the meat had turned into hard pellets.  Our plates were also too hot to touch, so I'd assume that they were up in the window for a while.  When our server finally came by to take plates (I assume she didn't do a quality check because she knows how terrible it is) I told her how bad it was, she she just laughed....   I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Ever."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend up the CN Tower for her birthday... and we had an unplanned eating frenzy at Horizon's - and what a pleasant surprise!  We sat on the east side right next to a window on a beautiful day and were distracted by the brilliant views of the Toronto islands, boats, and passerby planes.  We actually shared a $32 3-course price fix deal for lunch and found that was more than enough food.  And it was great food as well.  We first shared shrimp spring rolls accompanied by a salad of shredded mango, red pepper, cucumber and onion, which was almost the best part and was barely described on the menu.  It was beautifully presented and we wished we'd taken a photo but it was so delicious that we'd already gobbled it up... or is it down?  The main was the Club Sandwich with sweet potato fries.  We actually couldn't even finish all the fries, though served hot and quite tasty.  The sandwich was just massive... and probably the freshest tastiest club sandwich I can remember having.  For dessert, we shared the profiteroles with french vanilla ice cream, topped with warm chocolate sauce and toasted almonds.  Dessert is almost always my favourite part and this was no exception.  There were three of the ice cream filled pastries, which was actually one too many.  We even said we had no idea how one person could finish this meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, AMAZONG VIEW, great customer service, not very busy. I'm visiting from California I love this place and its view. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious on February 3 with a friend for lunch. We were greeted by an unprofessional and rude hostess. However the waiters were all great, friendly and cheerful. Food was decent but not as amazing as last year's winterlicious. The view as always is beautiful. Go during lunch on a weekday, it's quite quiet and private."}
{"text":"This place has very nice view. i.e. the entire Toronto.  But the food portion is fairly small."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good purely for the view. And well they know it. We came in midday after our tour through the CN tower. This was our first day in Toronto and we didn't know the area, since this place was already here, and it was snowing, we decided to give it a try.  There wasn't a lot of people. But our waiter took his sweet time bringing us menus. When he finally came back and took our drink order we already knew what we wanted. He wasn't very nice, not ride or anything, just dry I would say. Not attentive at all.  It was here we found out there aren't free refills for drinks. Ah we Americans are so spoiled.   Food wise, I got a ramen bowl. Ot was OK. Hubby got a burger, fries didn't come with, their menu is a la carte... they only have a few entrees. This is one of two restaurants up here. The other one is a 5 star. We had dinner there, so I guess that makes us gluttons for punishment. They got you, and there's nothing you can do about it. There are no other restaurants close, a few blocks,  and when is snowing. It matters. View is fantastic though. We got fog, but that isn't their fault. Pretty average place."}
{"text":"Went with my family for winterlicious before. The service was great and the view was fantastic. I loved that it was nice and quiet.  The food was good, but it wasn't specially great or anything. Nothing particularly special. The salad was great though."}
{"text":"A great alternative to the 360 restaurant in the CN Tower. You do have to pay the fee to get to that level, but what great is that there is no need for a reservation and there is immediate seating. The menu had a wide variety of food to choose from and the food was definitely better than I expected. My boyfriend enjoyed the salmon while I enjoyed a burger. They have a decent drink menu as it is a must to enjoy beverage while admiring the view. The service was good and they were sweet to accommodate my boyfriends request to present our dessert with a birthday candle (as I was celebrating my birthday there.) I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the CN Tower that doesn't want the fuss of the 360 restaurant."}
{"text":"Sat there 15 minutes and no service. A table next to us went to ask for service, and they took orders for 2 other tables except ours. After another 5 minutes had passed we were finally approached, but considering how we were neglected there was no way I would spend time, or money, at this place. The hostess Natalia was very informal when guiding us to a table. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Due to bad weather, the fact we were super hungry, and we were already in the CN Tower, we thought eh.... let's just give it a try. Now drop an m before the eh, and meh is exactly what I felt about this place. I ordered the VEGETARIAN spaghetti bolognaise, which  had sausage in it. Because of the weather and 0 visibility, we were the only customers in the restaurant. Being the only people you think you would great amazing service right? WRONG! Waiter spent more time on the other side of the restaurant chatting it up with the other staff than ever checking on us. When he came and got our plates when we were done (good indication that it would be a good time to bring the bill) he completely disappeared. After about 20 mins I had to go search the restaurant for him to ask him for the bill. If your hungry and in the tower, check out the other restaurant, or pay $4 for a bag of chips out of the vending machine instead of wasting your money here."}
{"text":"GO GO GO! Amazing views of the city, especially if you can make it there right before the sun starts to set, you'll be in for a real treat. Our waiter Donald, slowed down our order so that we wouldn't miss the sunset. The food is great and reasonably priced. The Caesar salad is amazing...not sure what the dressing is (it's not Caesar) but the salad comes in a tortilla shell garnished with cherry tomato halves. I had the cheeseburger and my dad got the salmon with potatoes au gratin. Both were absolutely scrumptious. Save room for desert and treat yourself to the creme brulee trio. DIVINE DESERT. They offer a three-course meal for like $32, which gets you a salad, entree and dessert. It's a great deal...the salmon alone is $22 and the desert trio is $10. There are other dishes to choose from in the prix fixe menu. Treat your eyes and your taste buds at Horizons. The food here and at 360 comes from the same kitchen, only difference is the 360 restaurant spins, you need reservations an it's more expensive."}
{"text":"It's good for families but you'll probably want to just get a drink because it's very exciting. I'd just go to just wait for your reservation to the 360 restaurant on the upper floor. Long story short, good place but just for drinks is the way to go"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mauricio was our server. He seemed to be annoyed with us when we asked for a wine list. It took forever for him to take our drink order, a long time to get our drinks and we had to hunt him down for our check.  We were going to eat there but he changed our mind."}
{"text":"Burger meat was too cooked (I asked rare), fries were as good as they are at McDonald's. I would have appreciated a smile or something from the crew (like pretty much anywhere else), but... no. Service wasn't warm. Was I welcome here ?  Nice view, though. (2 stars for that)"}
{"text":"Keep your expectation low and you should not be disappointed.  Had to wait longer to be seated than would be expected.  The views are naturally awesome given the location in the CN Tower.  The food quality was not bad but nothing special either. I found it expensive but given the tourist trap location was not surprised.  I did enjoy the desert I had a great deal and the sweet potato fries were god as well"}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious. For the view.and it was amazing!!!  Food is above average,but not the greatest. But service Is a bit slow and not as friendly."}
{"text":"Since we bought the premier tickets, eating up at the top of the CN Tower was a must.  A little pricey for what you get, but you are paying for the view.  Wines are steep!  Again, wine with a view of Toronto ain't cheap!  Shared fries and a cesar salad with chicken.  I didn't see any parmesan.  I guess that doesn't come with the view.  The server looked tired, but it's understandable dealing with the kind of tourists that come up here.  After speaking to him about visiting his city, and speaking to him because he's a person, he brightened up.  Even told us his sister lived out in Long Beach and that he was going to visit one day.  if you plan on eating here, you should, just to be able to take in the view, and stay as long as you like."}
{"text":"Today was my second time there. Both of the times,we were served by the same guy. Today i noticed,his name is Kabir. His service is terrible, just like the last time.  What kind of a waiter messes up bringing tea? Do you not pay attention to your job at all? Why don't you say sorry when you spill a little tea on the table? We don't deserve to be served a mighty person like you? Are you doing us a favor? Did we bother you at a bad time? Do you hate your job? Never coming back there. There were only like 5 tables and still managed to do a bad job. Such a lousy service in a such a nice, iconic place...weird..."}
{"text":"My first here and this little cafe did not disappoint! I had the poutine, which was astounding! It was my first time ever having poutine, and, while I know the Horizons poutine is not the traditional poutine, it was an incredible first experience. First, the dish came out pipping hot, which is exactly how every meal should come. Second, the quality of the food was exceptional! The fries were fresh and crispy, and that sauce was everything!! Lastly, the waitress made the meal all the better. She was lovely, very patient, and took a genuine interest in getting to know us and point out things to do in the city. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service. Let's start there. For four people on our bill was over $200. The food was bar food at best. Our server we saw twice , took our order and brought our food. No drink refills, no checking to see if we enjoyed our meal. The service here was horrible, I have had better guest service at McDonalds. Avoid this place you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Attended Horizon's Winterlicious event.   The food and value are truly there.   For $23.00, you get a 3 course meal that is a-ok and hard to find anywhere else in the city.   The food was well prepared and service was a little inconsistent but the view more than made up for it.   Yes there is a 10.00 fee to go up but even at 33.00 before tax/ tip...is still a value considering the regular lift ticket is 35.00.  You get a free meal out of the price of the elevator ride and you get full access to the observation deck and glasd floor!"}
{"text":"We booked this space for a private event and we found the decor to be fairly dated for what we were looking for. Luckily we were able to fully dress the space to reflect what we needed but it was a lot of heavy lifting on our part. The view was really great, I was super happy with how we were able to section off the restaurant.   We had our own bar which was good. Breakfast was a standard continental breakfast - really nothing special here. Lunch was fine, the only thing I really like was the risotto ball. Overall, the food was what you would expect from a standard hotel or corporate venue. The service staff was nice and helpful and the view really can't be beat."}
{"text":"Horizon cafe on CN Tower has been my *for sure* destination during  Winterlicious last 3 years. Its surprisingly CHEAP! $15 for lunch and $25 for dinner + $10 lift ticket for entering CN Tower(including free access to reservation deck jumpping on glass floor) Heeheehee! What a deal cant miss! I have always gone there for lunch, you get to see better view of city during the day, During winter time, you are most likely getting a clear blue sky, blue water and seeing and everything else covered in white snow including airport. spectacular  view. If you jump on glass floor it wont be black underneath glass like at night.    Without knowing the price, you would have guessed that you are paying a $40-45 lunch rather than $15 ! It's one of only places I would be all satisfied throughout the three course meal. Just went to another place for Winterlitious dinner last weekend. They have the best smoked salmon in town, there is seasoned goat cheese with asparagus wrapped by salmon like shape of sushi, served with fresh salad, lemon and vinaigrette.  Their seafood pot pie, and chicken dish are both great! The seafood pie is filled with salmon, white fish, baby shrimps, scallop in a soupy thick sauce, sealed by the pastry baked in big boul. The sauce would thicken as the baked pastry falls into the bowl. I had the chicken dish when I went for the second time, its similar to chicken parm. Its basically huge piece of chicken breast around half inch thickness breaded and fried to perfection.Thoroughly cooked yet tender and juicy. It came in very unconventional plate setting. It looked like bushy salad sitting on top of huge piece of fried chicken!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You would have expected meat and salad to be separated usually! In this case its for reason, the salad with perfect seasoning complimenting the fried chicken breast. Its meant to eat \"together\". Food served in a warm plate so keeps food warm longer, suits a slow eater like me, or if you are taking time having a conversation with your companion during the meal. (Huge bonus)  Expect to be full before the desert! And expect feeling bloated and about to jump off the CN Tower after the desert! I have been to CN Tower Winterlitious lunch 5 times all together, I have never not left feeling stuffed. They serve decent potion and not cheap on desert. I had chocolate lava cake. It tastes like a *cake* version of Lindor Chocolate. It has less cake texture, but more of smooth of mixture of dense warm smooth chocolate with melted guuey center, topped with cold chocolate ice cream. Its a  triple threat of different texture and contrast of warm and cold. It comes in fair size and its very heavy!! The apple crumble is great too! slices apple wedges baked in sticky cinnamon sauce with condensed milk and vanilla sauce. I wish they would have come with ice cream though. I am sure you can ask for it . They had the similar thing served with ice cream last year. I thought was the best apple crumble I have had ever.   Its a very romantic place to go if you want breath taking view.   PS. keep in mind its Horizon Cafe, not 360 restaurant. Horizon cafe is one level below 360 restaurant I believe. Only Horizon cafe has winterlitious menu. If you go to 360 then expecting to spend $200 for two. I told my boss about the great deal last year, but he thought was 360 restaurant, so he took his gf there for her bday ended up spending $$. I like Horizon Cafe much better, its more contemporary and fresh than the little out dated look at 360 restaurant."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this restaurant existed until I saw it as an option for Winterlicious. I hear about the 360 Restaurant all the time but it's price point just isn't in my budget. Their Prix Fixe lunch menu was $23, excluding taxes and gratuities, which wasn't bad for their portion sizes. I also want to add that they charge an additional $10 to go up the CN Tower and access the Glass Floor and LookOut. Regular admission to go up the CN Tower is $35, by the way. Now onto the food!  Appetizer: Smoked salmon parfait with pickled cucumber, saffron goat cheese and Thuet's sourdough crostini - the parfait was light and had the right blend of goat cheese. I found that the three pieces of crostini weren't enough for the amount of parfait that they give you but the parfait on its own is just as good.  Main entree: Beer braised lamb and Yukon gold potato tart with aged white cheddar, roasted root vegetables and rosemary jus - I was skeptical at first about the size of the tart but once it arrived, I noticed it was loaded with lamb and the mashed Yukon gold potatoes were on the side of the tart as well as on top of the lamb in the tart. Definitely the heavier option for their three entree choices.  Dessert: PB&J cheesecake with chocolate chip cookie base - a very sweet cheesecake! The cheesecake itself was peanut butter with peanuts throughout while the grape jelly component was the drizzle. It was topped with peanut brittle. Quite the contrast from the savoury entree that I ordered but I was too full to finish the dessert.  Our server was very friendly, helpful to answer our questions and provide her recommendations with the menu. Overall nice and clean atmosphere. If it wasn't foggy the day we went, you would have a nice view overlooking downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Nice view and good food for those that don't have reservations at 360. We had the 3-course Prix Fixe menu. Portions were great! There were a few different options but here's what I went with: Wedge Salad (large wedge of iceberg lettuce and thick strips of crisp bacon), Salmon (crusted and served on top of a creamy potato gratin and bell pepper salad), Raspberry Brownie (sour cherries and chocolate ice cream). It was all delicious. Salad was crisp and fresh. Salmon was flaky and flavorful. Potato gratin was chunky and creamy with a nice bread crumb crust. The brownie was only ok. It wasn't a fresh/warm brownie. But the chocolate ice cream was really rich and creamy.  View - Great Food - Great Service - Slightly Below Average: the waiter was slow and unattentive. He wasn't very friendly either."}
{"text":"Obviously I came here for Winterlicious. No one's here for the food, we're all here for the view. We got a great spot overlooking Billy Bishop, but all spots are great spots here as long as you're close to the window.  The food was better than I expected it to be. The menu was pretty staid, but they still put some effort into the presentation.  The cheesecake was frozen, but everyone loves cheesecake out of a box, so it was fine. The service petered out toward the end, but it's probably better that I didn't get to order a second round."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here for the view and the great prices on their lunch menu considering the high traffic of tourists place. When we entered no one greeted us, and we waited a couple of minutes before a waitors said that we can sit anywhere for lunch. It took awhile again before the waitor took our order. We got the Old Weston Pulled Beef nachos, Gerrard Street Butter Chicken Poutine and the Riverdale Sirloin burger. The nachos they gave was a huge portion easy enough to share with a group of 4. The nachos were crispy and the beef was tender and juicy. The toppings of guacamole, sour cream, onions, tomatoes and spring onions were generous and tasted fresh. The Poutine was the best Poutine I ate during my entire trip in Toronto. It tasted like chicken tikka Masala as the meat was tender and juicy complimented with the creaminess of the yogurt dip and the cheese curds and had  a hint of a spicy kick. The fries were crispy and we'll salt and peppered. The burger was also okay a bit dry but the Sirloin was well flavored. The view was a plus and they didn't seem to mind the tourists from coming into the restaurants and taking pictures since the restaurant wasn't packed. The waitor never seemed to check on us unless you called them over. The prices for dinner though are hiked up but I'm sure the view is provides a much more romantic setting at night and the menu is much more expanded. Excellent food but poor service."}
{"text":"Pleasant enough for the views it offers, and definitely cheaper than 360. The multiple entrances were a bit confusing, and it took a while before a server noticed us. Otherwise, good service.  Food was decent, but nothing to rave about in my opinion. Just the more affordable choice if you want to dine atop the tower."}
{"text":"Bland over-priced food. Dreadfully poor and unattentive service. Awesome view!  It's ok if you want a something to eat and a drink whilst up the CN Tower, but you're better off enjoying the view from the lookout levels, then heading down and going to one of the many bars around Front St. You'll get much better food for much less."}
{"text":"Went for the second time for a nice cup for hot chocolate and dessert with my friends. The hot chocolate was the instant ones from any grocery store, profiteroles were stale. Asked the waiter to bring something else thats fresh and he suggested chocolate cake. But even that was so bad. I paid around 40$ per person to get up there to enjoy a very cold day(-20) and was seriously so disappointed."}
{"text":"Unknowing where to grab a bite to eat, my husband and I came upon Horizons as we were visiting the CN Tower. The food was surprisingly good. I ordered their prix fix menu and husband ordered a burger. Delicious food, beautiful view of the city, and pleasant atmosphere-what more could you ask for?
