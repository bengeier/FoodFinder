{"text":"The place was cute! Loved the coffee and salad. I'd probably try something other than the spinach and goat cheese quiche next time. It was okay but I was looking for something more flavorful."}
{"text":"I have a silly little obsession with French cafés and this is the closest you are going to get to a truly French café in South Scottsdale. First and most importantly, the croissants are fantastic. Be sure to go in the morning because they do sell out sometimes. The coffee is strong and not-at-all bitter and it great hot or iced. My children love the macarons and we get a pack each time we eat there. 

So far The kids and I have had the omelettes, the waffles and the crepes. I think next time I will have a croque monsieur. It all is amazing!

The decor has a rustic/industrial feel and is absolutely photogenic and fun!"}
{"text":"Only been here for breakfast but let me tell you this place is amazing! If you looking for a big plate, greasy breakfast to help with your hangover this is not the place for you. If you looking for a lighter, healthier meal to give you energy to start your day then go here!

They have a small, limited menu but don't let that turn you off. With a small menu they are able to perfect everything on it. I never left disappointed. The egg Benedict is one of the best that I ever tasted. I also love their breakfast sandwich. 

I want to try their dinner options."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything is homemade and the flavors are out of this world! They have the best croissants. I am not vegan, but tried their homemade chocolate vegan ice scream and it was the best! I also had the Chicken Normandy for dinner..sooo good! I will definitely be back! I really don't even want to tell anyone about this hidden gem..but oops the secrets out!"}
{"text":"Saw Merci on Check Please AZ and tried it right away.  It was right after the show aired and they acknowledged they were having a little surge in business after the show, but the place was not overly crowded.  The food was disappointing.  It was only fair.  The pastries were stale, and this after a surge in business.  I will not be going back.  So much for Check Please.  Take their reviews with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Is there anything more simple and beautiful than a perfectly poached egg for brunch? I think not. Merci's Eggs Benedict was exactly what I wanted for a lazy sunday brunch. My better half enjoyed her modern updated Croque Madame, and the absolutely adorable ambiance here couldn't be anymore perfect than it was. Duc is quite possibly one of the most gracious business owners in the Scottsdale area, and this small mom and pop establishment is the kind of place that makes eating out memorable and great, as opposed to some routine habit to sustain our bodies. What our society needs is to slow down and work on sustaining our souls. This is the place to do so. The idea of going into another chain automaton after enjoying an afternoon at Merci is impossible and shameful. The staff here are well appointed, classy, accommodating and friendly. The only warning is that their splendid pastry case will be staring at you, and beckoning you to finish your meal quicker, every step of the way. We shared a Chocolate Raspberry Mogador, which was also, like the rest of the experience, perfect; silky smooth chocolate mousse, with a raspberry topping which was the ideal touch of sweetness. Picture included...don't be jealous, just go get your own."}
{"text":"My MIL and I had lunch here today and we absolutely loved it. The food was amazing and served promptly and the staff was genuine and pleasant. They were sure to bring out my two year old son's food first so we could keep him busy, and helped us rearrange the tables to give him more room in his high chair. After our order arrived, the chef came to our table to check on us which was really unexpected and appreciated for a little casual lunch date. My MIL had a goat cheese and spinach quiche and I had a lobster salad baguette, and they were both SO good. The house-made dressing on both of our salads was really tasty as well and the fries I stole from my son's plate were yummy. I am so happy that we discovered this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by and got the Harmony salad to go. The ingredients included goat cheese and avocado, which sounded amazing. When I got home, I saw that my avocado was brown and there was no goat cheese. Also, the dressing was ranch. While it didn't say what type of dressing came with the salad, I would expect some type of vinaigrette. The chicken was tender, and the veggies were fresh. But, I was disappointed after spending $12 on this mediocre salad with a missing item and brown avocado. Not sure if I would come back, but I definitely would look at the food before I get home."}
{"text":"Ah I don't know...call me crazy but I can't love this place as much as I want to. 
We came here on the weekend for breakfast. It was right after the time the served breakfast but they could see the majority of the people here wanted it so they said they could make it. 
We got a croissant and a glass of lemonade to start - both of those were delicious. The lemonade is made with sparking water or something of the nature which gives it a tart flavor without too much lemon. 
At this point the service was okay. We were somewhat acknowledged when we sat down but nothing too friendly. You could tell one of the two waitresses was new...it's not a big place so it was easy to see the more experienced one was getting frustrated. Not professional. 
I ordered eggs Benedict while my boyfriend ordered an omelet...which was suggested over the egg croissant. My food came out cold with the tiniest amount I hollandaise, I asked for a side...so she brought me a cold side of it. Seriously? On top of my already cold food, thank you. 
My boyfriends omelet looked like an omelet. Zero exciting things about it. Personally I would have gotten the sandwich, he wasn't thrilled, but at least it was warm. The food comes with a side salad. Odd that this is greens with a ranch like dressing (which is actually rather good) instead of potatoes or fruit or something more breakfast traditional, hey even a tomato slice like most of Europe. 
Overall, I wasn't impressed. The flavors tasted like something I could find at any dinner or breakfast joint. I liked the lemonade and the baked goods...the other desserts looked good but didn't try any. I don't recommend breakfast, I may go back for lunch to give it a second try because it has such good reviews but it needs some work. As well as some better service. A party of six walked in and she said \"I don't have room for you\". No, if you wait for 10 minutes we can seat you. Odd. The decor is cute, a little pricey, and not worth the food...maybe the dessert and lemonade though."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Merci, as I've heard / read great reviews.

Went for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend. We met at noon, and there were probably about five other tables sitting down & eating when we arrived. We were greeted warmly and told to sit where we liked. 

Our server quickly stopped by & was polite. We both ordered an open-face sandwich, and my friend ordered a bowl of asparagus soup - she was excited to know that it was vegan & made fresh.

It was at this point that our experience turned from being great to 'meh'. We waited for nearly 45 mins to get our sandwiches. Someone (not our server) did stop by and let us know that our orders were under way & apologized for the wait. When our sandwiches finally came, my friend asked about her soup - and was told it would be out shortly. She then asked to cancel the order, as she really didn't think she'd have room to try it after the sandwich. Why they didn't think to bring it out during the previous 45 minutes we were waiting is beyond me.

About five minutes later we called our server over and asked how long their crepes took to make. I'm 7 months pregnant, and once I saw that they had Nutella Crepes on the menu, it was really all I could think about. She said about 10 minutes - so I asked her to put an order in (worried that it would take far longer, judging how long the sandwiches took.)

She came out to our table a short time later and informed us that they were all out of crepes. But they had ice-cream, should I want that. I am by no means an expert or even remotely experienced with running a restaurant, but how do you run out of crepes? I have made them before- you put a few ingredients together & then cook them on the stove. AND there is a grocery store in the same complex, so if you had run out of, let's say, eggs - couldn't you go buy some? I know I'm pregnant and not really that patient when it comes to craving, but come on.

The food we did get to eat was good. The people who work there were friendly, but I was by no means 'wowed' enough to plan a trip back."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about Merci. Duc the owner and master chef is the creative mind behind every meal served and his love of food comes across in every bite! 

All of their beef comes from grass - fed, antibiotic free growers and from local farms whenever possible, as a health and humanitarian conscious diner it is such a relief to find a restaraunt where the chef cares about the quality of the dining experience as much as we do. 

Great atmosphere, friendly staff,  do yourself a favor and stop by Merci today!"}
{"text":"Went to Merci on March 1st for breakfast. The Chef came out and greeted us and made us fantastic food. Coffee was great and the pastries are to die for. The location is no great shakes (in a shopping center next to a Subway) but don't let that discourage you, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"We absolutely love all there is on the menu.  Best french restaurant we found so far in Scottsdale.  Duc made us the best Quiche for Christmas we ever had.  You can bring your own wine and just enjoy a fabulous dinner."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little place with good food!  My son had the Lamb Stew and the sauce was amazing!  I had the Duck Confit and it was very good.  We will be back for breakfast for sure!  Loved that the Chef comes and checks on your meal!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the lunches. Not up to \"French\" standards. The service was abysmal. Maybe the pastries are good?"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently stopped in on a vacation. It was fantastic. The waitstaff was phenomenal! When our server Lucy began speaking french to my wife I felt like I was back in Paris! Lucy greeted us as soon as we walked through the door and we felt well accommodated the whole time. The food was great, the prices very fair, and the macaroons were to die for. A wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place in the space that used to be a bakery.  I came in for lunch because of the excellent reviews on yelp.

That a special board outside and most of the specials average between $15-$18. I thought that was a little pricey for lunch but went on in. 

There were a few people there (not crowded, not empty).  I was seated right away and offered the choice of ice tea or lemonade. They had green or black ice tea of which I got the black.

I looked over the menu and settled on the black truffle burger for $14.  The burger was small, but served with fries and a side salad. The burger was kind of bland and the mushrooms didn't taste like truffle or truffle oil.  The bun was interesting, but the bottom was soggy.  The truffled fries didn't taste of truffle at all. The small salad of greens and tomatoes was good. Unfortunately nothing about my burger with black truffles or my truffle fries tasted like truffle.

My bill was over $18 with tax and over $22 with tip.  My food was not bad and the service was good, but lunch failed on a price-performance basis.

I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Very clean & the food is delicious, very friendly environment."}

{"text":"We were in Paris last spring so we thought a meal at Merci would bring back fond memories. It was a disappointment. My husband ordered the French Onion Soup. It was served lukewarm and it did not have the rich, depth of flavor one expects from onion soup. I ordered the Quiche Lorraine. It too was served lukewarm and tasted like it was made with very little cheese and little or no cream. I also ordered the French Hot Chocolate which turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all. Good French Hot Chocolate is so rich and thick you think you're sipping a melted Hershey's bar. Merci's was not much better than a packet of dry cocoa mix with whipped cream on top. If you're looking for an authentic French meal Merci is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant with an intimate setting. Everything is made to order and delicious"}
{"text":"Can not say enough about this truly delightful little restaurant. We have been eating here since it originally opened under the name \"Scratch\" and it just gets better & better. Croissants & Macaroons (try the rose or pistachio) are great, the Crab cake burger has a light touch (when served with the fries its a piece of heaven for lunch) and my absolute favorite is to pair the Muscles in white wine & garlic with Duck Confit & herbed french fries - wow - bring bottle of your own wine (BYOB) and what could be better !!!!  If you want a laid back quite venue where you can eat locally sourced produce and hang out with friends this is the spot ( its a small operation so service can be a bit slow)  Chef Duc is a Treasure - In a valley filled with great high end chain chain restaurants this simple venue is a stand out."}
{"text":"Simply great food! Started with the French Onion Soup which is the key factor for me in determining a French Cafe's quality.  The soup was excellent, but the bread was a bit soggy, a little crunchier would be nice. Then onto Eggs Benedict which had delicious, perfectly poached eggs and the ham was amazing.  The hollandaise sauce was between the egg and the english muffin so it got absorbed into the English muffin though but that's ok, it was an interesting way to do it as it softened the bread.  Side salads were nice and cut the fattiness of the egg dish nicely.  Got a creme brulee to go and looking forward to eating it tonight!"}
{"text":"Great food, so glad they are back in business. Please bring back the balsamic salad dressing!!!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in Oldtown! I ordered the breakfast sandwich and coffee. It's made with bacon and eggs wrapped in a croissant, a side of hash browns, and a mixed green salad. It was a good portion, probably a little larger than I would normally finish, but I was hungry today. The prices are very reasonable for the portion and quality. The croissant was flaky, buttery, and delicious, and the bacon was thick cut and crispy, perfect for me. I was a little disappointed they didn't have espresso drinks yet, but the regular coffee was very good as well. They should be serving espresso drinks soon. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict which looked delicious, but sadly he ate it all before I could snag a bite. He said it was very good. The eggs were poached perfectly. He would have preferred bacon, which he's had before, but I generally prefer the traditional ham with my benedict. 

The staff is helpful and very friendly. As a nice touch, the owner/ chef came over to make sure everything was to our liking. The atmosphere is good. It seems like it's still a little work in progress, but I'd say shabby chic. It's the same owners and location formerly known as Scratch with a similar menu. Scratch was one of my favorite breakfast places, so I was very excited to see they opened a new restaurant. I was not disappointed. I'm sure Merci will remain one of my favorites. I'm excited to try the lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great food and cute atmosphere...I had the hummus (because I wasn't hungry) and it was delicious. The pita bread was so soft and fresh. The hot chocolate is also really good but a little \"rich\" so I recommend sharing. This place is BYOB so if you want some French wine, bring your own. The staff was also very polite and attentive. Looking forward to going back. Especially for desert."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. The eggs benedict was delicious, and the french toast was even better. Definitely try the croissants, they are some of the best I've had outside of Paris. The tart I had wasn't amazing, but the mousse was. Good coffee, too."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Always consistent with the customer service, food, and experience. You can't lose  breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Definitely a place you want to come and enjoy your time don't rush."}
{"text":"Delicious. Such a quaint little spot. We went on Memorial Day for breakfast. Wasn't too busy when we arrived but still a little too busy for the one server they had working. Nevertheless service was prompt, she did a great job looking after everyone. 
 Food was delicious. Eggs Florentine so well done I would eat it everyday! French Toast was super sweet. A little too rich for my breakfast tastes but so yummy! Can't wait to go back and try the desserts I hear so much about. Try them out!"}
{"text":"So good that my dad and I ate here twice in 24 hours on an overnight trip to Scottsdale, and we would have made that three times but they were not open for dinner on Monday night! Very fresh, very generous portions, and very well balanced flavors with extremely reasonable prices, served with beautiful presentation in a very timely manner, plus a dog-friendly patio, easy parking, and a pretty but unpretentious decor--it deserves at least five stars! The salads were crazy good and HUGE, the fries homemade and totally yummy. Excellent lamb burger as well, and the pain au chocolat tasted like the ones you get in the good boulangeries in Paris. Its strip mall location makes it all the more fun as a find, you'll be so happily surprised! Go here."}
{"text":"Awww, this place is so cute! Small and sweet. I came here hoping for an authentic French menu and that is what I got. I ordered the fresh salmon and it was amazing. It  was cooked and seasoned perfectly. And the desserts where so authentic and beautiful. Owner is also super nice. I love this place! Yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite french cafe in the valley by far!! Friendliest staff, most welcoming owners, and of course amazing food! I often go in just for a coffee and croissant on my way to work and now my boss and co workers insist I bring them the same every time! Hands down the best croissant and coffee you will have as well."}
{"text":"We have been faithful customers since years, and are glad they are back.  Today, after we received a very favorable prognosis for  hubby's multiple foot and leg fractures, and because I had not eaten the entire day, we came here at 4.30pm to celebrate.  Duc saved my live!  We had the most delicious Rib Eye steak ever, and that is no exaggeration.  He is so understanding, kind and great empathy for all.  Precious locale, precious cook, and precious friend.  Thank you, et merci infiniment pour toujours."}
{"text":"This is a review is for the hot chocolate. I came and ordered their famous hot chocolate. Not only was the hot chocolate filled only half my cup! They charged me 5$ for it. I hope management changes the price and / or the amount of hot chocolate. I was a regular. I'm thinking twice next time .."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. I had the best pastry I have ever eaten. Amazing. But just as good as the food is the friendliness of the owners and the staff. I will definitely go back there again -- and again."}
{"text":"Merci French Cafe and Patisserie  is  ***** TOPS *****  You really must try it.

+Creative, Ejoyable MENU,
+Excellent QUALITY,
+Well PREPARED
+Appetizing PRESENTATION,
+Friendly SERVICE,
+Affordable PRICES,
+Comfortable ATMOSPHERE.

I ordered EGGS FLORENTINE and when I told the server I was amazed at how good the plate looked she said chef Duc is also a photographer; so he always tries to make the food look appetizing. He succeeded. 

An appetizing presentation helps, but quality and preparation are key. 
The poached eggs were warm and creamy with a light sauce over them, the spinach was tasty, the muffin was toasty, the \"hashbrowns\" were not over cooked and the side salad was colorful.

I was a very satisfied customer and will come back with family and friends.

If you are wondering about \"French\", 
NO you don't have to speak french, just enjoy some topnotch french style cooking.

This place was once called Scratch,  it now has a new name, but it's even better.

And if you want to indulge yourself try some of their desserts.
I can't guarantee their calorie content, but you will enjoy their wonderful taste.

Bon Appetit.

{"text":"Place is really cute with good food. I got the crab cake burger and it was delicious. They have a full espresso bar and great croissant pastries. It's not too expensive either. I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is run by a friendly Frenchman who is an excellent chef. I ate here before when it was called Scratch and really enjoyed my meal. This morning I had the breakfast sandwich and it was one of the best that I've had in a long time. Everything was nicely flavored and it came with a delicious side salad. As I looked over the menu I keep seeing high quality dishes at reasonable prices. I will be coming back to try their dinner menu very soon."}
{"text":"The chocolate cresant was so delicious and light. Really good. The French toast is very rich, good but it is sweet."}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here at least once a month. The quiches are phenomenal and I love that they serve them with a side salad. All their food seems to be homemade and it is delicious."}
{"text":"The almond croissant, chocolate croissant and lemon pie were all very tasty. The server took sometime to bring out the order but was so nice to acknowledge it and gave us an extra croissant. Definitely five star service !!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning it was the salmon smoked salmon with egg poached egg on a English muffin with hollandaise sauce and it was perfection. Absolute Delight the cappuccino in the side talked it off it was just beautiful"}
{"text":"New name same terrible management. I would be a stressed waitress too if there was no one to bus tables but me. However, give patrons a wait time or have them sign in. It was irritating to see a couple who arrived after us get seated first. Waiting is not a big deal, but ignoring customers is. Find someone who knows how to run a business and prioritizes customer service."}
{"text":"I could not have been more pleased with this beautiful little french cafe.  Clean, uncluttered, simple are the words that come to mind as far as the feel of the place.  
We sat on the patio which had a garden feel to it. The chairs were comfortable af.  We received our food within 10 minutes of ordering.  Food choices were:
French onion soup-mmmmmm.  Very flavorful, chunky, nice crouton, good cheese, good portion,  beautiful presentation.
We also got a croque madam.  Good ham, perfect egg, good salt, bread was appropriate to stand against an egg yolk, bechamel sauce and juice from ham.  Both meals were served with a good sized salad.
We had an orange juice with our meal that tasted fresh squeezed.  We grabbed a multichocolate mousse on the way out.  Daaaaaamn was it chocolaty, creamy, silky, and portioned right.
I could tell that the quality of the food was good. And it was simple unpretentious food.
While we were eating a guy came out and asked us how the food was.  I am assuming it was the chef.  This struck a note with me, he asked us what we thought and after vigorous full mouthed head nods from the both of us he smiled, gave a little bow and went back inside.  A humble man honing his craft.
LOVED this place.  10/10 from me."}
{"text":"I love to go to this small restaurant with my wife. The food is great and the pastries and desserts are the real thing. Nice quiet ambiance. I wish they stayed open later in the evening."}
{"text":"If you've been to France, then you have a higher standard for what French food should taste like.  This place and only one other place in the Valley fits the bill.  Spot on execution!!!  Yum and bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Birthday dessert and it did not disappoint. Excellent desserts. We ended up trying their salad and the French onion soup as well and both were delicious!"}
{"text":"It's true this little space is full of ambiance but there are some things that should be tweaked.  I've had the pate' sandwich and it really lacked taste.  The Quiche Lorraine is good.  Only one of the half dozen escargots were edible...the rest was like chewing on rubber.  The sauce they were in had no flavor except of oil...where was the garlic!  The bread served with it was phenomenal.  When they say the salad is of mixed greens ~ it's anything but lettuce.  A lot of people expect a salad to consist of more than grassy stuff.  The two-flavor chocolate mousse was not bad ~ but I've had better and a lot more of it in one serving. Also, the meringue chantilly was really nothing but air and crumbled apart with only one bite.  $6.95 to eat AIR?"}
{"text":"The food was ok, prices are reasonable. I had the eggs Benedict, the eggs were slightly undercooked for my taste, I don't like when the egg white isn't cooked through. Owner was really friendly, staff were pretty average, one waitress was complaining that 'touching other people's food is disgusting', I'd say she might want to rethink her career as a waitress... I don't think I'll be going back, but it was good to try this place out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and before I officially made my move to NY I got to stop in for breakfast. 

Long story short, their breakfast food was great and the service was so-so. I love French food and all of their breakfast items were on point. I also loved the dessert items that they offered. All of their menu items seemed to be very authentic. I would've liked a chance to go there for lunch but unfortunately I was unable to before I left. I look forward to try it out again once I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The most unassuming restaurant in Scottsdale, delivers in the best way possible. Quaint location, small dining room and a peak a boo kitchen make for a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience. I've now experienced coffee, breakfast and dinner and nothing has disappointed. The French chef came out to see how the duck confit he prepared was serving me, and I had to admit it's one of the best I've had. Very French to its core, authentic. Highly recommended if you're trying to escape the noise of old town without leaving."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! Great food and great staff! Duc is a master! The deserts are works of art! Have the nicoise! Have really anything! It's all good!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are visitors from California and we just wanted a cafe that served pastries and sweets.

I ordered a Sweet Nutella Crepe while my friend ordered a salad and sandwich plus an Americano. 

My order was a plain crepe with whipped cream on the top and Nutella in the inside and was about $6.50.

I think the ambiance and atmosphere is really cute and laid back. We were seated near a group of maybe about 12 people, only to realized that they were actually speaking French! Must be a good place if French people actually come to a French cafe.

Tried their macarons and they are the BEST macarons I ever tasted! I got the Caramel flavor. The macaron is pretty big size, crunchy on the outside, and so soft on the inside. Yummyyy~ They are $3.50 each.

Only downside was that I thought the total bill was a bit pricey. A total of 5 items including tip was about $30-$35."}
{"text":"Four stars for taste of food.
Three stars for service and not selling the items listed on the menu.
Three stars for price of certain menu items.


The food here is great and reasonably priced for the quality; however, the beverages, specifically coffee (espresso, cappuccino, latte, etc...) are very pricey.  My boyfriend ordered a hot chocolate which was almost $5.00 my coffee was about $4.00.  The hot chocolate was good, my cappuccino mediocre, not worth $4.00.  

I feel like I could have had a happy hour glass of wine for that price.  

We wanted a QUICK snack after shopping at Fry's in the same plaza, and I wanted to sample their homemade ice creams, which were delicious.  I will return to purchase a pint or a gallon of the lavender-blueberry -- I highly recommend.

I dislike the fact that the last two times I've been here they are not serving crepes.  Crepes have been a menu item for months and have not been available.  Clearly the French know crepes best, so why are they not selling them and why are they still on the menu if they are not selling them?  Please take them off your menu, Merci!!!

I stop to eat here on occasion looking for a little something special and low-key in Scottsdale.  This place is quaint and classy, just disappointed about the crepes situation.

One other comment:  The service is very slow too.  I don't know if this is intended since a lot of European's eat later in the evenings and spend several hours at the dinner table, but if you're looking for a quick bite, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO!  We were there almost and hour this evening and ordered a cappuccino, hot chocolate and their ice cream sampler.  Most of that time was spent waiting on the waitress and waiting on the items to be prepared.

I will return when I have more time to kill.  

Bring your iPad or laptop while you are waiting, they have WiFi."}
{"text":"A real disappointment. Lobster Bisque not as good as Costco's but a lot more expensive.

Lobster Salad tasteless on cold baguette and obviously pre-made and old.

Maybe they are good for quiche and pastries."}
{"text":"Great food, I just wish it was a bit less expensive, keeping in mind the portions and location.  I'd come here more, if they had happy hour, or less expensive specials.  The food itself is 5 stars, I just can't justify regularly spending $10 or more on a burger."}
{"text":"What makes Merci so exceptional, is the incredible attention to quality given to each and every ingredient of every dish. I would eat the hamburgers any day just for the bread alone. The proprietor, Duc, makes all his own bread and with extraordinary quality. Having sold bread to high end restaurants in NYC, I know excellent quality when I see it. 

The Croque Madame is another fine example of how every single item on every dish is in and of it's own, exceptional quality. The end result of course is excellence in the completed dish. 

My favorite dish by far is Duc's Beef Bourguignon. It's far better than even my own beef bourguignon, and mine is better than most restaurants in the valley. The main difference is that these are the foods that Chef Duc grew up with, and he makes them like they were made for him growing up in France. A true Parisian flavor that can't be matched by picking recipes out of a cookbook. 

The desserts of course are in a class all of their own. Duc plays with creamy and delicate textures making flavors you've had before, seem like an entirely new experience. Some of my favorite desserts are the caramel cheesecake and the orange tart. The cheesecake is much more subtle in flavor and much more creamy in texture than what you might be familiar with in other more pedestrian establishments. The orange tart on the other hand, is both smooth and creamy texture, but with a bold orange flavor that is absolutely invigorating. 

Overall, what makes Merci so unlike any other place, is 2 things. The incredible attention to quality in every single ingredient, and the fact that Chef Duc makes for us the foods that he grew up with himself, which are a world apart from what any other local chef might pick out of a recipe book or even create on his/her own after years of experience. 

It's simply a level of bliss that can't be matched."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I joined my book club members here, we reserved 8 seats, and all received great service. I often feel anxious about staying too long past eating as I am aware of what that means from a servers perspective. But as we were there to discuss our book, we stayed for over an hour past eating.  Not once did we feel like we were being rushed or receive dirty looks from staff (which would have been understandable). We will definitely return, maybe not for a meeting but just for food."}
{"text":"Always such a pleasure eating here! So delicious, reasonably priced, wonderful ambiance and decor, and constantly convincing myself that I'm allowed to take home some of their wonderful desserts. The wife and I love it! ONLY wish they were open later for OUR convenience, but it's worth working around :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on 1 visit as was visiting Scottsdale from out of town. Was there for lunch. Food was fresh and most of it good. Nice menu with daily specials. I had lobster salad on baguette. Was very good.  Baguette was especially good. Served with nice spring greens salad. Spouse had truffle burger. Said it was very good. Came with shoe string fries but the fries were very greasy & didnt eat them. Very clean & bright inside. Friendly, counter service. Would go again."}
{"text":"The egg benedicts are amazing. Husband loves the croissants. Great atmosphere.

The only wish is that they serve breakfast earlier on the weekdays. There were times we went and the chef was not there yet so we only had croissants and other pastries to choose from when I really wanted a benedict so if it is a weekday and you want breakfast more than just a croissant call ahead to make sure that they are serving it!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts and lattes ever. Literally everything I've had here was beyond good."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here today. She got here earlier and got the last two croissants which were delicious. However, the rest of the lunch was very disappointing. We each ordered Vichysoisse and then split Quiche Lorraine.  They do not provide table service. You order at counter and they bring it to your table. My friend had coffee and they do not refill the cup. The Vichysoisse was the biggest disappointment--texture was gritty and it was finished with olive oil   I don't know how those ingredients can become gritty. We sent it back and they gave us a refund--$8.95 per serving. The quiche was also bad--crust neither crisp nor flavorful.  We have both dined there before and enjoyed the food previously."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. The French toast was amazing! No waiting or long lines. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I came back because my granddaughter was in town and she loves Merci's salads.  We walked in and asked if you could sit at the table to which we pointed.  We were told to look at the menu on the chalkboard because I had to order at the cashier.  I didn't know that they didn't have table service despite being here several times before.  I believe they now have service at dinner only.  
I asked a woman server what accompanied the Tuna Melt.  Her answer was that she didn't know because it was her second day on the job.  Then she went on with her business as if I hadn't asked the question. I would have expected to tell me that she will find out.  Nothing.  Nada.  
I decided to just have the same salad my granddaughter was having and call it a day.  The total was $25 and change and at that point I was shown the screen which prompted me to select a tip.  Really?  I not only NOT get my menu question answered: I not only have to get on a line to order (like McDonald's) ; and I don't know what kind of \"service\" I am going to receive and you want a tip now?  Up to this point I had received no service so I chose NOT to add a tip at this time to which the male/asian cashier seemed appalled.  I told him that I would tip according to the service that I would receive.  I don't understand what kind of tip he expected me to leave considering I stood on line for my food.  Does Burger King or Jack in the Box expect a tip for having the customer stand on a line to get his/her food?  Ridiculous.  
The Caprese salad was ample and composed and not over dressed.  I received no real service other than having my salads brought to my table.  I was surprised I didn't have to bring the dishes back to the kitchen.  My granddaughter is a fan of their hot chocolate for which we waited over 12 minutes.  The hot chocolate wasn't worth the time or the money.  
This visit was a bust for me.  I don't enjoy eating at a place where owners/staff think they are doing YOU a favor by serving you food.  
Arrogance is what brings people down.  It will also bring down a restaurant because people go out to eat to enjoy the food and the experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice.  Both times I really enjoyed the coffees and pastries.  The macarons and croissants were excellent.  Both times I also had the brie open faced sandwich.  I loved it on my first visit, but it wasn't quite as good when I returned.  I'm not sure why.  All in all though, this is a really cute place and I would love to give it another try when I'm back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fantastic!   This is my new favorite place.  Breakfast was so fresh and delicious, feels like you are transported to Paris instantly.  The owners are parents at my kids' school-feels good going knowing you're supporting a small business owner and their family.  They clearly know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"What's there not to love about this gem .simple delicious happy food with chilax energy and great affable owners .. Must go whenever I'm in Scottsdale .."}
{"text":"Place is amazing!! 

Small restaurant in the center near subway and frys. The decor was very fun and cute. 

We came in for brunch. I got the florentine Benedict and added avocados and my boyfriend got the Italian sand which. Both meals were accompanied by a side salad. My boyfriend said after his first bite \"so simple yet soooo good\". We would definitely come back again for dinner because we have to try the French onion soup next ! 

Chai latte lacked a little flavor but not a huge deal. They gave me a huge mug.

They have a bunch of macaroons -- we got oreo, blueberry, chocolate on the way out"}
{"text":"I really was going to give this place 5 stars. We had the Brie open faced sandwich and the eggs Benedict as well as a pear tart and chocolate tart on a Sunday at around 1 pm. The servers were friendly and the food came out fast. The food was delicious and we thought it was worth the drive from Peoria after seeing it on Check Please Arizona. 

This is where my stars fell. There was a couple that walked in at 1:28. The sign outside said that it was open until 2 pm but when they entered the women at register said that the kitchen was closed. The couple did not seem happy and another restaurant I am sure received their business. I thought that was strange. If you want to close at 1:30 change your hours."}
{"text":"Super delicious casual neighborhood cafe with great food. I had the lamb burger; wow! Delicious and the homemade brioche was irresistible."}
{"text":"Thanks a lot for this great time in your very cute French cafe! The Chef and the staff are so nice, ready to share his amazing recipes for a baking lover like me... J'ai retrouvé le goût de ma France qui me manque tant... Sincèrement Merci... See you very soon!"}
{"text":"As it is right by my work a Coworker and I gave it a shot, she ordered lunch and I ordered just a desert.. We were seated quickly, our orders was taken quickly and our food arrived to us quickly. My Only gripe is that we did have to wait a little long for our check but loved that they used the square system and we signed and were able to tip from the Ipad. Our servers was very sweet I really loved the atmosphere. as we were leaving we were thanked by the chef for stopping in. All and all a very positive experience. I would stop in again"}
{"text":"The FOOD QUALITY is far above average. The food has actual flavor. I was so pleasantly surprised with the attention to detail. The service was lightning fast. 
Why wasn't the place full of people? I am not sure .
I will be back- the entire menu looks good.
Tourists, fear not, they have several large gourmet burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered their signature chocolate cake for a relative's big birthday.   The cake was such a hit that EVERYONE  had 2 slices!!! The birthday gal even said it was \"the best cake I have ever had\". If you want an AMAZING  cake for a special occasion come here and get Duc to make it for you. Hands down the best cake I have had in Arizona. This calibre of cake is usually only found in France as it is not overly sweet, and the combination of chocolate and raspberry is devine. BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"The second time I came here I got yogurt, latte with vanilla and French toast. I love yogurt here so much, always with a beautiful decoration! But somehow I feel like that strawberry n'utalle crêpe was not that exquisite as I expected cuz I tasted it and the crêpe was not fresh enough. A good thing was that The decoration of that crêpe was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight before a show at the ASU Kerr theatre. Fantastic as always, I've been going to Scratch for a long time, and Merci hits all the same notes that keeps me coming back.

Except the balsamic vinaigrette is gone. Bring it back please! :)

Amazing pastries, I've taken many groups of people here, and it's always a hit."}
{"text":"Today was my second trip to Merci, third if you count when it went by a different name. Every time they have been out of croissants with plenty of time before they close. They're always asking if we want to wait 25 minutes for them to cook. Why don't you just keep making croissants? I heard our server ask two other parties if they also wanted to wait! Don't stop making croissants until it's closer to closing time! We were two hours from close and our server suggested we call ahead so they can set some aside for is next time. Unbelievable.

For a breakfast sandwich, the replacement starch is their delicious French bread. It's fantastic but you only get one piece and instead of it being built like a sandwich, it's a mini omelette on a piece of bread.

I've also had their burger. I asked for medium and received a greasy well-done chewy burger. The fries looked like they'd soaked in oil overnight and the burger came with an herby mayo that tasted nice but was not represented on the menu. 

I was going to give this three stars because of the French bread, the macaroons and the friendly staff but the rest of the food just isn't that great. I was also told that my macaroon purchase wasn't the best and I wasn't too happy with that reaction. I'm hoping their dinner specials are better than the brunch but I will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"I was really hoping I could get a lobster roll as it should be.  Instead, I got an avocado, pesto roll with very little lobster.  Very disappointed.  I've ordered the lobster roll previously.  Tons of lobster meat.  No avocado and pesto .  Also, Merci adds Parmesan to your \"lobster roll\".  Not cool.  Cheese and lobster have no place with each other in the sand which world.  I feel cheated.  2 oz of lobster on each sandwich."}
{"text":"My wife and I walk by Merci all the time, and we're very glad we finally gave it a try for brunch.

She got the Croque Madame, and I got the Eggs Royale.  
We were both very happy.  Everything tasted very fresh, and it wasn't too expensive.

They only have 2 tables on their patio, which is a bit unfortunate, but it's dog-friendly, which is very nice.

For dinner, it's BYOB with an $8 Corkage Fee, which is a good deal.

I would definitely recommend this as a casual brunch or dinner date.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I returned from Paris a few days ago longing for the wonderful pastries I found there. Immediately, I set out to find a French bakery in Scottsdale and to my surprise discovered that Merci Patisserie made its pastries and croissants with the exact same flavor and delicacy as the Parisian bakeries. What a treat!  As an added bonus their prices are reasonable, their coffee is French and bottomless unlike in Paris. Their macarons not to be confused with macaroons are the most delicious and dense cookie  imaginable. Also I tried the homemade orange caramelized onion jam on a croissant and found the flavor very unique and yummy. Next...breakfast, lunch and dinner will be in my future!

{"text":"what a hidden gem. The food was really good and loved their decor incorporating a little bit of Mexican flavor. 

I had the cranberry Brie open face sandwich, florentine eggs Benedict and the hot chocolate which tastes like chocolate syrup. The milk and foam was amazinggg. will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and ordered french toast and breakfast sandwich. Both were simple or even unassuming until you become aware of the little details. French toast: wife's first words were \"this is crack!\". She was hooked on it at first bite. The bread she likened to pound cake, real whipped cream on top (big difference from the kind that comes out of a nozzle), bananas and nuts had an invisible caramel glaze and the syrup was marvelous. I tasted it and I loved it. My breakfast sandwich turned out to be and egg, some cheese, and some bacon on their fresh baked croissant, a salad and hash browns. All come together and form  a wonderful breakfast. Simple but top notch ingredients and preparation. i love this place!"}
{"text":"Love their pastries! Caramel chocolate tarte was yummy a must Share with your other half! So sweet but so yummy!! The macaroons, well lots of options but pistachio was a fantastic option! Love this place !"}
{"text":"Incredibly cute inside and delicious food! I had the special...lamb burger with fries and a salad. The fries were to-die-for. My husband declared them the best fries he's ever eaten! I love the location as well - it's still near old-town but still away from the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"Was in the area and looking for a quick dessert. Service and pastries were phenomenal. The lemon tart was delicious and the rum cake had great flavor. Had such a great experience grabbed some pastries to take home as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great French cafe! The food was great, I loved how authentic the choices on the menu were. The staff were amazing as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely place we will be back .... ordered the ribeye  and fries wow the fries were awesome the sauce on the ribeye is very garlicky which I love but just FYI .....My hubby had the Beef Bourguignon melt in your mouth delicious very rich .... dessert was from heaven  and the French press coffee so smooth ..... the restaurant owner was out and about in the restaurant you don't see they very often it was a great personal touch ..."}
{"text":"Finally I went to this cute place! I had some onion soup with side salad and chocolate croissant. I didn't like the soup much had to return it. Barely any onions! Now the square of bread that was inside the soup tasted odd like old bread. Also the cheese was very strong that was over the bread. It came with a side salad which barely any dressing on it, I believe it was ranch and I saw a couple of cherry tomatoes. I felt like I was eating grass, hardly any flavor. I had to remind the girl a couple of times we wanted our water and not to forget to give us our chocolate croissants. Then she said she only charged me for 1 croissant she didn't know I wanted 2 croissants. Meanwhile I saw another girl asking if she could have her break and coffee. Later I saw they where getting busy and she only had this Asian girl helping her, which kind of looked lost too. I also bought some Madeleine, butter cookies and almond croissants to take home. The Madeleines tasted like corn bread. The butter cookies where good but the Almond croissants where too small and not enough almond paste. Now my daughter ordered the Croque Madam, it was out of this world. So it depends what you like and if it's your taste. I might go back again and check out some other things too."}
{"text":"Dirty, lousy service, go at your own risk.. They didn't even care about the dirty utensils..."}
{"text":"I have a constant fluctuating schedule, I had built up quite the appetite and when I walked in it was 10 minutes before they closed.  They were very welcoming and made me a great salmon plate.  In other restaurants I'm rushed out the door or treated rudely or both, but not here!  My food was delicious, the place looks really stylish, very friendly staff, and great music.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Merci was a great find! Most Sundays it's difficult to get into a restaurant for breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised to get in without any wait time. I had the homemade croissant egg sandwich. It was flaky & delectable. Was surprised with the generous two sides that came with it - crispy hash browns & salad!! Unfortunately, the potatoes were cold. The waiter was gracious and brought us an extra plate of hot hash browns very quickly. The desserts looked amazing. That will be for a future visit. The only negative I saw was that one of the waitresses delivered a dog dish of water to a pooch on the patio, then without washing her hands began to replenish water at another table. I'm sensitive about cross contamination!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem between a Subway and RadioShack in a local shopping center. Beef bourguinon...awesome. Duck confit...awesome. Great sandwiches too. Save room for dessert too. Multiple desserts! Merci also serves a great kids meal, the best grilled cheese your child will ever eat!"}
{"text":"The BEST!!!! Like no exaggeration, Merci has the best lattes, the best quiche (please don't tell my god-mother because she will kill me), the best crab burgers, the best Brie sandwich and the BEST people working there. It doesn't hurt they have my namesake ;-) LOL!!"}
{"text":"This croissant is very flaky, but in my long history of eating chocolate croissants this one cannot crack the top ten. The price is reasonable at about three bucks, but there was a clear lack of chocolate. It doesn't need to be like  a fudge sundae, but some more of the signature chocolate would have been n ice. A fairly regular, just fine, not great pastry."}
{"text":"Five star company with delicious food. Merci is a super cute French cafe which was a nice venue for the International Supper Club. Thanks, Monica for pulling it together.

I had scoured Yelp reviews, photos and checked the menu online. I was a little bummed that they didn't have duck rillette. When I asked what cheese they used, the server replied cheddar, Swiss or a mixed for the gratin on the French Onion   Soup. So I ordered the Croque Madame which absolutely did not disappoint. The ham was smoky and nicely cured. It tasted like country style ham nicely warmed. My fried egg was fried perfectly sunny side up. The baguette was toasty and had a great texture. I ended my meal with a chocolate mousse with layers of flavor topped with crumble. Heavenly. I tried a couple of other desserts my friends ordered. The baba rum had lots of booze, a little on the sweet side. The layered chocolate with raspberry something was nice, too. I coveted Aileen's hot chocolate. It was sweet and if I had strawberries, I would dunk them in. 

Thank you, Chef Duc for the lovely dinner. A huge \"thank you\" for my foodie friends who made me feel so much at home. Until we meet to eat again! To Monica and the next International Supper Club!"}
{"text":"Yum. Croissants. Are. Heavenly. Omelets, crepes, macaroons, oh my! Wonderful service. The owner came out the Both times we were in and checked on how our food was. Always excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Not to mention the food! We will be back 100%. They called us to let us know the kitchen was closing soon after we inquired about having a dog friendly patio. When we arrived there was a reserve red table with a dog bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy Merci (formerly known as Scratch) is back in business. The service is better than ever and the menu has been slightly revamped. Great for a croissant and espresso or a full meal. The open-faced Brie sandwich is like heaven on French bread. 

Don't forget a macaroon for the road!"}
{"text":"Food is so authentic and delicious! They also use cage free eggs and grass fed beef. The wait staff was knowledgable and attentive even though it is a Sunday and very busy."}
{"text":"Such an adorable place! Decor was so cute!! Eggs Florentine were great as well, very well done! Also shout out to the adorable solar eclipse fans we met inside!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Mushroom soup & side salad. Lemon pound cake & latte. It was a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was Scratch, so I was really happy that they reopened. It's a great lunch spot, their menu has a French flair and consists of mostly salads and sandwiches. Their portion sizes are very generous and they use decent ingredients. So far I've tried a few sandwiches and the goat cheese salad which was very good, you could tell that they used high quality cheese since it was so flavorful. They also have a delicious vegan coconut soup, that you can't tell is vegan. Their croissants are very good too. I will definitely come back and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Located in a modest commercial shopping strip in Scottsdale, the café features friendly service, a casual ambiance accentuated by French-themed decorative items, and tasty French and French-inspired fare that won't strain the pocketbook. I enjoyed the French onion soup and the escargot that I ordered; both items came with bread and salad, so I got more of those sides than I had expected. My dinner companions let me sample the desserts they ordered and these were really heavenly. The relaxed atmosphere is conducive to leisurely dining and conversation, and although they do not serve alcohol, you can bring your own; just be aware that there is a corkage fee. Those who hesitate to partake of French cafe fare because of either the expense or the sometimes snobbish atmosphere generally associated with such places should come and try this delightful café."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that most people (or those that actually open a french cafe?) don't know what a decent croissant is. Cause this place def doesn't have them. Undercooked on the inside....

The coffee here is awful - undrinkable. And those little creamers...? What about some fresh cream or milk? Coffee quality is better at Dunkin Donuts. 

Last comment would be that overall back of house/counter area looks like it could use a clean up. Doesn't look like the cleanest place. It's a shame...how about a wipe down of the counter by the creamers and sugar?

Pastries looked presentable, however I did not try."}
{"text":"Very quaint little French bistro. We went for brunch one Saturday. Alexi was our waitress; friendly...definitely a people-person. I ordered the delicious ham, bacon, and cheese quiche,which came with a garden salad and fried potatoes. Mr. O'Zandra had the smoked salmon open-faced sandwich. He's still talking about it! Great experience! We'll return for dinner for sure!"}
{"text":"I gave this place four tries before deciding to leave a review of Merci. The food is good, but the service has consistently left a bad taste in my mouth. Every meal I've ordered -- unaltered and straight off the menu, not even off the specials board -- has been made incorrectly or doesn't contain ingredients in the description. 

Twice, I have ordered a sandwich, which is more expensive than the menu's open-sandwich (flatbread) alternative. I didn't receive a sandwich either time. The second time, I made a point to be specific -- \"I want the sandwich with two slices of bread from this section of the menu.\" And I still received an open-faced sandwich.

I'm a businesswoman, so I order to go and am disappointed when I unwrap the bag and find something different from what I ordered. What makes this worse is I've been stiffed a few dollars repeatedly by receiving the wrong menu item. 

This restaurant needs to address its communication issues between its servers and kitchen staff.

All of this said, everything from the pastry case that I've had is well-composed. I just wish the entire cafe was as well-composed."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The French fries were my highlight! The French onion soup was fantastic. Everything was great, highly recommend the almond crossaint!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered an innocuous sounding egg sandwich for takeout.  
What I got was a lovely breakfast sandwich + greens + a wee bit of hash browns.  
I couldn't finish it all!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I haven't been here in years! I used to live right down the street but have since moved. I popped in here for lunch with a friend and we both had the most amazing salads! Not to mention, the service was so friendly! 

Im totally spacing the name of the salad but it had mixed greens, incredible marinated chicken, goat cheese, red peppers, avocado, cucumbers and a tasty vinaigrette. It was HUGE and so hearty + filling which is hard to find in a salad these days! I'll absolutely be back for this dream in a salad bowl! I also ordered their lavender green tea to wash it down, yes please! 

Thanks for a tasty lunch, Merci! I'll most definitely be back for another meal soon!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food! An extremely surprising and enjoyable experience. The food, the service and the Decour are all more than what could be expected. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is without a doubt a must see! It's a french cafe in the heart of old town Scottsdale. Chef Duc is an incredible chef and the cuisine is so authentic! He comes out and greets just about every face that walks in. Truly cares about the guest and their experience here at MERCI! Wait staff is just as amazing, a couple of  things you should try is the open face turkey club sandwich, the chocolate mousse, and the coffee is too die for! Great date spot too!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and was delighted by the ambience despite its location in a fairly concrete strip mall. They have a delicious-looking display of sweets that I'll have to try next time. My boyfriend and I split the French onion soup and salad combo and a tuna melt. Everything was delicious and fairly light considering the orders. The open-faced tuna melt comes with hard- boiled egg one the sandwich, which was a great addition to the usual tuna melt. The bread tastes fresh and wasn't greasy. Overall, the quality of ingredients here seem fresh and the menu has popular items that are made with a little flair. I'd love to come back and try other things here!"}
{"text":"What a lovely discovery - a moist reasonably priced French restaurant in central city Scottsdale  This spot has been on our visit list for months; finally tried it with friends. It is BYOB which adds to the fun. I had the scallops with a side of fresh lightly steamed vegetables. Larry had a chicken presentation over pasta. St a table next to us the steak and fries suggested that I return soon. Of course the lobster bisque with a salad for $9.95 also suggested that I return for lunch 
Merci is not large nor glamorous - just a lovely family-owned restaurant the serves excellent food at very reasonable priced
Hope to see you all there."}
{"text":"I have always had the brunch...now I had the lunch....YUM! great little place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an exceptional French cafe, with tons of atmosphere you need to try Merci's French café and pastries."}
{"text":"This can be best described as French/Vietnamese fusion heaven. I've been a customer here for ages. Merci is one of those gems that are underrated. I have sampled everything on the menu and there isn't one thing I've yet to not like. I have eaten at Michelin star rated restaraunts before who haven't put out plates as delicious as the ones Merci puts out. The owners are amazing and the employees always have amazing things to say about how they are treated. The husband/executive chef will come out and greet people during the course of their mean or after which shows he's proud of the delicacies he has created. You can tell family and pride and humbleness are big with him. I could literally go on and on about Merci so I'm going to cut this short. Food is beyond amazing. Atmosphere friendly,cozy and enjoyable. Service is phenomenal. And I love all the high fashion art work here."}
{"text":"went here the other day for my birthday!  it was awesome!  Had to check it out because it used to be this great little pastry place that we loved, but then it changed, and it's even better now.  Same owners, same chef, but with an expanded menu.

We were just in for a quick snack after doing some shopping.  Of course we got pastries to go.  We had a couple of orders of escargot which came with a nice fresh spring mix salad that was really nice.

They don't have liquor license, but you can bring your own, which since they're right across the parking lot from Fry's actually makes a little since in terms of your pocketbook.

I also had a bowl of their french onion soup, which was killer!

The owner and chef came out to speak with us several times, what a great guy!

Staff was was friendly and made us feel at home.

This is a great place!  I was really happy to see that the owners were the same as the previous pastry shop and that they still had those amazing deserts!"}
{"text":"Good food but the people working there need to get some customer service training. It ruins the food. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is so so stinkin adorable, hidden and unsuspecting in a strip mall of blandness. Who would ever think there's a gem amidst a Subway, bikram yoga studio and Fry's grocery store? Exactly. You miss it unless you are a foodie following the scent of bliss...And well, I have a weakness for French -  French food, French people, French kissing. Can you tell yet?

Every time I frequent here, it transports me to a time of romanticism that just leaves one smiling. It's never short of cute couples canoodling or sweet hand holding. How can I not sit and soak that up?!?!! If you ever feel alone, just come here and drop the Harlequinn book. The patio is lovely for coffee and conversation and inside draws you in with the colorful placemats adding so much whimsy and cheeriness. You can catch the specials board outside greeting you and letting your wallet anticipate the tab. I think it's unfair to say this place can be pricey when people are comparing it to a basic Denny's breakfast or Good Egg omelette. You don't come here for that. 

It is one of my favorite neighborhood spots, probably because I could run home and rid myself of the guilt for consuming too much, if that's such a thing with food. They serve local coffee from a roaster up in Cave Creek so I am already smitten. I will say every time I've been here, they are always out of chocolate croissants. Whoever is taking all of them, you are on my radar to hunt down!!!! Seriously the baker needs to make more than a handful. It's ridiculous that you are out before mid morning. Shameful to us devotees. Hands down the french toast is incredibly uh-mazing. I love that it's crustless and the sauce makes me seriously want to dip myself in it and lick for hours. 

What I love is that they offer more than just  breakfast items which makes me such a frequent patron here. Not going to lie, I wasn't as impressed with the sandwich selections, especially on a month where I did meatless challenge. Your only option was the brie sandwich and that was not filling enough. Pretty but little substance and I'm more about content. I can't wait to try the lamb or mussels on my update review so hang tight for that!

It's only short a star because I haven't done dinner here and the service can be spotty. My first time, the pregnant server was such a doll. On another return, I met the server that everyone complained over. I think she's just very French and it's not necessarily bad service. I guess I don't expect my servers to be doting over me but when they do, I certainly take note and tip well for their customer delighting skills."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. It's right next to subways in the Frys plaza. The ambiance is beautiful and comfortable. It's perfect for a couples brunch or even solo. The owner is incredibly friendly and had at least eight people stop by just to congratulate him on his opening. I had a croque Madame with a side of arugula and spinach salad. I overheard the ranch was homemade. My sandwich was open faced and had so much flavor. I can tell that they put a lot of thought into their menu because the sandwich was immensely flavorful with spices and garlic. The desserts were staring at me the whole time. They were gorgeous. He even have every customer a free almond croissant to take home. It was probably homemade as well. I overheard a guy say his Benedict was the best he ever had. 

Just a warning the espresso machine wasn't there yet but they said it would be in a couple days. In all fairness they opened today. I bet their lattes will be amazing. 

Go here!"}
{"text":"You'd never guess that such a wonderful little cafe is nestled between a Subway and I can't even remember what other business in a strip mall with a Fry's. Don't let this deceive you; a hidden treasure full of culinary bliss awaits! 

I've been here several times and the food quality is extremely consistent. The chef prepares fresh foods cooked to order with wonderful organic ingredients. 

I've have the crab cake for lunch, served on a brioche bun that tastes of butter and melts in your mouth like a puffy cloud. The cake itself had chunks of crab and was nicely held together without being bready itself. It was accompanied by fresh cut fries that were savory and well seasoned. Amazing! 

Breakfast is fabulous as well. There were several of us waiting before 9, which is when they open. As soon as the doors swung open you were taken to Paris with the smell of fresh croissant baking and coffee perking. 
The croissant sell out! Once you taste one you'll know why. Buttery, flaky, fresh baked bliss. The French press coffee was great. Enter our breakfasts... The best French toast my mom has ever tasted ( she's 60 so this means something), the organic buckwheat crepes were light, fresh and the fillings so savory and well seasoned, the omelette fluffy and buttery, and the croissant breakfast sandwich amazing. 

This place has the best desserts in the area hands down ( I'm a baker, this chef knows what he is doing, it's all made from scratch and fresh because it sells so fast). 

The atmosphere is so cute and has a hint on luxury with crystal chandeliers and cute glass dinner wear. 

Ahhhhh and you can enjoy the patio on a warm day! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time for service and then just left. Seems they do not focus on new customers."}
{"text":"I have one word to describe Merci: CLUELESS. The food wasn't bad, not great, but certainly not bad. So why do we say \"Clueless\"? To start with, we've passed the place many times (we shop at the Fry's nearby) but it's far from obvious what they are: it could be a clothing store or a French Bistro or...we couldn't tell from driving past. And no website as far as we can see. 

But we saw it on Check Please Arizona and decided to give it a try for dinner. Unfortunately, from the moment we walked in, the tone was set. The owner himself was out front and tried to steer us to the counter...until he saw the bottle of wine we'd brought (they are BYOB). Then he said, take whatever table you'd like...which we did. Couldn't he have asked whether we were there for dinner? Apparently not. Clueless.

The waitress was friendly enough (nice nose ring) but was largely no where to be found...even though she was within spitting distance the whole time we were there. The two of us sat at a 4-top, so did she clear the other two settings? Nope. Did she fill our water glasses? Nope. Fill our wine glasses...even once? Not a chance...though we are paying for corkage. 

We started with escargot to share...not bad (good quality snails), done classic Bourguignon style with the addition of a bit of pesto. Came with two HUGE pieces of (ice cold) bread and a side salad (maybe makes sense at lunch, but why as an appetizer at dinner?), but only one plate and one escargot fork between the two of us...couldn't they manage two when we told her we were sharing? Nope, Clueless. 

For our main courses, we ordered Beef (boeuf) Bourguignon (better than average even with the store-bought noodles) and \"steak au poivre\"...but she had no idea what \"au poivre\" meant until I showed her the menu: \"steak with pepper sauce\" (which was decent, though short on \"poivre\"). Did she ask how I wanted the steak cooked? Of course not. Clueless. 

We could go on...e.g., she couldn't be bothered to pick up the money we left...but we'll spare you the details. Simply said, they are CLUELESS!

We may give it a try at breakfast or lunch, but again for dinner? Not a chance."}
{"text":"Stopped by this nice little neighborhood cafe for Mother's Day Brunch.  Comfortable atmosphere, very authentic, and the food and service were AMAZING!  I've been to France and this cafe makes me feel like I'm there again. The Croissants are flaky, light and delicious, the omlettes and Eggs Benedict were great, and the breakfast sandwich combined their fresh omlettes with a delicious croissant for a breakfast you can't miss.  They use farm fresh ingredients (cage free eggs, organic produce) and focus on quality at very reasonable prices. Also, try their Chai tea latte and expresso, both very good as well!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my quiche.  Service was slow and we ordered croissants that we never got (they sold the last ones to someone after we ordered them). Frustrating, but we went back the next day and got some and they were to die for.

Take a dose of patience as there are only a couple of servers and they are also working the counter.  

The ambiance is great, there is outdoor seating and I can't wait to try them for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place! My mom and I came in for a Valentine's day lunch, the decor and ambiance was fantastic and the food was even better! I believe that we had the brie and black truffle sandwich and my mother had the croque madame. We also took home some of their beautiful desserts and they tasted wonderful! Definitely will be visiting again to try the mussels :-)"}
{"text":"Location was good.
Ambiance was the best part.
Service was okay - a bit standoffish but bordering on friendly.
Food was disappointing and took forever.
Son had the Croque Madame.  It was simple.  Egg was cooked well.  Bread with thick sliced ham, some cheese and an egg cooked on top.  Served with lettuce, tiny bit of dressing and a couple tomatoes.
I had the baquette with proscuitto and cheese.  The baquette reminded my of Rhodes dinner rolls.  The ones you left proof on the kitchen counter when they are frozen and then bake.  Super minimal amount of meat and think slices of block cheese.  This was something I could easily recreate at home, better for less money.
Got a couple macaroons to go for my girls.  They thought they were okay.  This is a trendy item right now that you can get in so many places.  Price here was to high.
Did not care for the iced tea (had rose water in it maybe?) and was never offered a refill.

I can't imagine going back to this place.  To many other places to try in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch one day and had a pretty good experience minus the slow service.   The atmosphere is nice and I love that the patio is dog friendly.  We enjoyed the italian open faced sandwich with prosciutto, mozzarella, bacon and pesto with a side of fries - super tasty and it completely hit the spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"An unexpected delight! One wouldn't think that there could be a nice little French restaurant in a strip mall. The brunch was delicious. We had eggs benedict and a quiche both of which were served with mixed greens. It's byob so if you want a mimosa bring your own bubbles. The coffee was quite nice as well. I would definitely return to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I love french food, so I had to go and try this place out.

The inside is a very cute cafe feel. You order your food at the front and they bring the food to your seat. They serve breakfast only until 11:30, so If you want some breakfast foods, show up on time. 

I ordered the croque Madame, my friend ordered the quiche and my hubby ordered the lamb burger. My croque Madame was delicious! It's near to impossible to eat it with your hands so I suggest using a fork and knife. It came with a crisp salad and it was nice and fresh. The lamb burger was amazing as well as the quiche. Both were fresh, hot and wroth every bite.

They also have a lot of desserts like macarons and tarts. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love this little casual, unpretentious cafe. I went there with my sister on a Sunday afternoon and we ordered the mussels with fries. You always get a plentiful helping of fresh mussels in each order. We've come here a couple of times now and the service has always been good. And if you have a sweet tooth, you're not going to be able to resist all the tempting desserts behind the display case. They are all good! I haven't had one I yet that I don't like."}
{"text":"Finding this place was SUCH a great surprise. I have a crazy obsession with almond croissants, so When I was running errands this morning and got a craving for something sweet, I popped in here and ordered one. And I have to say, it was one of the best- if not THE best I've ever had (and I've had many!). I ordered to go, but the atmosphere was so stinkin' cute, very Arcadia-esque. I'll be back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend an I live down the street so Merci is a regular spot for us to walk to on the weekends for a nice relaxing brunch. They allow dogs on there small patio which is great for us. The staff are all very kind and if the Owner is in, always makes a point to say hello and ask how everything is. If you are looking for a cute place off the beaten path from the Old Town scene this is the place. The decor is very charming and the food is light but full of flavor. They always have several different types of quiche, and several vegetarian options.  The best part though?...the desserts! I always make sure to try something different each time I go."}
{"text":"Ordered escargot, 5 of the 6 were good, a little to salty. Veal meatballs were very good with creamy potatoes. Beef bourguignon was good, a few to many potatoes. Reasonably price."}
{"text":"This is a gem! I love this place it is a quaint and cozy place the wait staff is always friendly and they know the menu, always describe the items so well my favorites are the Eggs Benedict, escargot and the last time I was there the server recommended the Quiche. It was fantastic! I have also purchased their baked goods wow what an assortment of goodies! Always fresh and delicious. They also have gift cards I have gotten a few and gave as gifts now my friends love this place too! Oh and the prices are very reasonable for an authentic French meal. I will be back real soon!"}
{"text":"Had two wonderful breakfasts at Merci. Very near to downtown Scottsdale and close to where we stayed. Lovely food, nice ambience and friendly service (although you go to the counter to order). Really, would you expect to find a truffle omelette and Belgian waffle (liege style) in the desert? And they were both excellent, with the omelette served with a small, lovely salad and hash browns. A liege waffle is one with sugar blended into the batter which caramelizes when the waffle is cooked (yum). It was served with fresh fruit and whipped cream. For our second visit we had eggs florentine (perfectly cooked and with home-made hollandaise) and a red pepper and goat cheese omelette (great flavor combination). We were on a roll (pun intended) and also had an almond croissant and an almond and pear tart. Both were delicious. The coffee at Merci also is excellent. Merci has a lunch and early dinner menu which includes duck confit and steak frites, among other items."}
{"text":"This café is so fabulous! The food is fresh and flavorful & the service is friendly, knowledgeable, & just all around excellent. I just had the Salmon, Asparagus, & Parmesan Quiche which came with a wonderful side salad of fresh spring mix. The quiche is so creamy & full of flavor with the egg & salmon balancing perfectly. For desert I chose the Raspberry Mogador Chocolate Mousse. The mousse is bursting with raspberry flavor while the chocolate melts over your tongue. It is so sensual. Very satisfying to say the least. If you haven't been you need to go. It is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I have gotten the salmon open face sandwich three times now. I love it. The people who also work here are always friendly. LOVE IT! The place is super cute too"}
{"text":"This place is so chic and you see all the yummy treats right when you walk in. The walls are decorated with pictures shot by the owner, who used to be a fashion photographer. Now onto the food...everything here is made from scratch. 
I usually go here for breakfast and always end up ordering way more than I can finish. I mean if you are going to a French cafe, then you have to start with fresh croissants, coffee and end the meal with some macarons. Their omelette and Eggs Florentine are both delicious. They are also pretty good about any food substitutions if you tell them ahead of time. 

This cafe is truly a great spot for a...ummm...comment dit-on en français...a gourmandise!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe!  The crab cake burger is amazing! And the mushroom soup (when its available) is the BEST!   Everything is so fresh and just delicious.  We come here for lunch quite often and have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"The chef puts heart, soul and flavors of childhood into his tasty creations.  I have been there for both lunch and dinner and have tried many mouthwatering selections from the menu.  My favorites are the beef bourguignon and croquet Madame.  The lemonade is tangy and refreshing.  The desserts are delicious but not too sweet and are prepared with the same care as everything else on the menu.  Another stand out is the bread.  The ingredients are obviously fresh and lovingly pick out.  

If you love a food adventure, can recognize passion transformed into edible wonders, and find yourself in Scottsdale then Merci is the place."}
{"text":"I've spent 10+ years searching for an authentic French Cafe in Phoenix. Finding MERCI was a blessing to my pallete and my desire for different ethnic foods! The Croquet Madame is superb, full of flavor and the portion is a good size. The salad dressing was creamy and even though it was a small amount, covered the large salad I received as a side, well. My friends got the lamb meatballs and Chicken linguini and both were also delicious. I can't wait to go again this week and try something new. And if you want a rich, decadent, orgasmically good dessert, but don't prefer chocolate... try the Baba Rum! It's incredible."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here.  I had to bring my husband back, mainly for the coffee.  So, I ordered the Eggs Benedict again because last time they were really good but basically room temperature.  This time they were actually cold!  They must make them ahead of time and refrigerate them.  Plus the ham was VERY fatty this time.  And by refrigerating the English muffin, it makes it soggy and limp.  Just not good.  Won't be back unless I need a fancy dessert."}
{"text":"First time here...around 10am. 

Ambience and decorations felt contemporary-french and inviting. 

Service was underwhelming.  Chairs and floor were dirty - wiping off a table so the food lands on the chair or floor is not cleaning.  Asked to not sit by a garbage can and was given a dirty look like sitting by trash is my fault. -1

Cappuccino was luke warm, no espresso flavor, tasted more like frothed milk.  I didnt even see an espresso machine.  -1

Burger tasted delicious but was warm in middle and served on an ice cold plate so burger was cold in a few minutes.  Salad was ok. -1

Unsure if ill give this place a second chance since they were off on everything."}
{"text":"A great, casual French dining option in Scottsdale.  A great plus is that it is BYOB and the cork fee is just $8.  

I had the beef bourguignon. It was very tender and flavorful.  My wife had the duck and enjoyed it very much.  

Looking forward to returning and trying other dishes on the menu. 

Plus they have macaroons available to purchase in packs of 3 for just $3.50."}
{"text":"I won't comment on the ambiance because the place is being renovated.  Well executed familiar French staples served at a great price point and with attentive service.  A stand out for breakfast in an area known for many breakfast standouts.  

My favorite Benedict in town.  It isn't too rich or large.  It is complemented nicely with the potatoes and salad.  The egg is poached to perfection and the ham has a nice balance of texture and fat."}
{"text":"This is the cutest most authentic French place you can find around. The service is excellent, the Ambiance is great and the food is surprisingly good. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Madeleine Peyroux station on Pandora..please please please think about playing some upbeat French Jazz..The place is cute, quaint, and trying to be French...but absolutely needs some better ambiance. Try it for a week see how it goes. Would love to see some organic  ketchup, Stevia, and carafes of real creamer vs the cheap fake 7-11 plastic packets. Otherwise food and desserts are magnifique that I have had! Patio is also dog friendly for those that have pups."}
{"text":"Overall I thought the food we ordered was fairly good, though it would have been better to eat in the cafe, rather than to go, since the buns got a little too soggy and everything was a little cold.  It seems like a great place to go and sit to relax and eat, but maybe not if you're in a rush.  This could have been our timing, since it sounded like one of the two people working the counter just left for break or something, however the process of getting all of our food packed and paid for took a really long time (15-20 minutes), even though it was ready and sitting on the counter when we got there.  I got the crab cake burger, which tasted great, but as I mentioned all of the juices caused the fried bits to get soggy and the patty fell apart as I ate it (again, probably much better eaten there).  I will say the price of the meal seemed fairly good for the portion.
The biggest disappointment was the desserts though.  My sister-in-law and I are really into pastries, and while these looked quite pretty in the case, they all tasted stale like they had been in the fridge for about a week.  We got a pear & almond tart, a mont blanc, and the baba rum.  The pear tart was the most tolerable of the three, however all of them tasted like they had been in the fridge for about a week.  Both the mont blanc and baba rum had whipped cream on them, and the edges of the cream were noticeably yellowed & dried out.  The whipped cream on the mont blanc had a meringue puff in the middle, which wasn't easy to cut through and squished the cream all over the place, and the rum sauce for the baba rum had an aftertaste I couldn't wait to get out of my mouth.  The pear tart had a canned pear in the middle, which seemed low quality for the cost, and the crust was also really firm.  I was sad to do so, but we threw out all three after only a couple of bites.
I'm only in town for another day or so, and with all the options available I don't think I'll get a chance to try Merci again, but if I did, I'd make sure to eat at the cafe, and head elsewhere for dessert."}
{"text":"I had been to Scratch a few times in the same location, and Merci didn't seem much different.  Especially when it comes to being out of croissants, well out of the butter croissants anyway.  And we were there fairly early on a weekend morning.  Oddly, my husband had the breakfast sandwich, and it was on a croissant.  Separate stash of them I guess.

For breakfast I had the eggs benedict.  It was okay, but the eggs were slightly overdone and the english muffin wasn't toasted.  I'm not sure if it that's just the way they make the dish, or if the toasting was undetectable.  Anyhow, that really ruined it for me.  Not enough so that I sent it back or wouldn't eat it, but I was disappointed.  I did really like the hollandaise sauce, but there was very little of it.  Just a little spoonful on top of each egg.  Maybe it's my American fat ass talking, but I would have liked just a little more please.

Definitely good enough to warrant a return trip though!"}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here on Sunday. I ordered the EGGS ROYALE which was 2 eggs poached on english muffin with Hollandaise sauce & smoked salmon!!! It was delicious. If you like salmon, I would recommend. I was also able to grab an americano to go with my meal!! Quick & easy!!!! I only wish they were open earlier - because I get hungry at around 7:30!!!"}
{"text":"Best place for lunch. Fantastic baked goods. Awesome service. This is a hidden gem in Phoenix. Can not recommend enough. My favorite is the quiche with salad. Also they do great take outs. If you want to order more than 4 croissants - call a day ahead - they go that fast."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of great pastries and this place has them!  The owner is French and makes all of the pastries and macaroons from scratch.  Great place for coffee/tea and a delicious dessert!"}
{"text":"Get the breakfast croissant sandwich with bacon and cheese. It comes with a salad and hash browns. Very good. Best hash browns in town bc it has french spices mixed in it. No ketchup needed. Yum!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite breakfast spots! A small restaurant in an unsuspecting shopping mall, Merci has made a great name for themselves. The staff always has a smile on their face, and genuinely seem like they have a passion for what they do. That passion is translated into a menu that is unique and delicious. My go to, the eggs royale, is one of the best eggs Benedict I've had. Only thing is they could add a little more of the sauce that comes on top. Also, the salad that comes on the plate is super yummy, but I wish it came on a separate plate. Too much going on in one space! But all in all I love this place, it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood cafe.  The decor is great, staff is friendly and the food is good and the coffee is great.  The portions are a little small (the open-faced sandwich at least) and the food took a while to come out.  What puts a damper on the welcoming atmosphere of the place is the large sign behind the counter that proclaims their right to refuse service to anyone.  Why is this necessary?  Who are they refusing service to?  I'm not sure if this is some sort of political statement, but it turns an otherwise comfortable, relaxed cafe into one that may not welcome some people."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for breakfast and the wait was about 15 minutes so we went elsewhere. The hostess was very courteous about it and we returned on Sunday morning for breakfast...what a hidden gem in Scottsdale! The food was excellent and the staff was very knowledgeable in their recommendations for breakfast. 

I personally had the French toast and it was some of the best I've had. Fresh bread and it was presented very well on the plate.

The ambiance of Merci is just like a small Parisian Caffè and the patio is excellent with the choice of music.

I strongly recommend visiting if you are in the area. I will be back for lunch and dinner for sure!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Merci today and ordered French onion soup. There were no onions in the soup.  I've made this soup.  The waitress asked if I'd like her to bring me some.  I cannot imagine where she would have gotten them, so politely refused."}
{"text":"A friend took me here. what a surprise. We had the Cypress salad with the best homemade mozzarella and a tarragon vinegar dressing. Delicious, I had the rib eye steak with cream pepper sauce. delicious. My friend had Beef bourgeon and the meat was so tender that it fell apart. The Creme Brule is out of this world, great service, warm and welcoming atmosphere. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very cute French cafe. The decor draws you in, but the food will keep you coming back. They import their grains from France  and the owner/chef is from France as well. There is indoor or outdoor seating. They have a pastry bar with quite a few unique selections! I got the Eggs Florentine, but had a hard time choosing because they also offer regular Eggs Benedict and Eggs Royal (crab cakes.) 

Wow! What a delicious meal! Everyone at my table was impressed with their food. Plus, the prices were reasonable! I will defiantly note this one down to eat at again. They had organic options, and they are vegetarian friendly, but it was a shame there wasn't any advertised vegan options. We left with an ice latte and a smile on our face.

* They had an inviting self serve water station, and one unisex restroom*"}
{"text":"The perfect little French cafe; the ambiance is great, charming and small with eclectic decor to tie in the cute quirkiness of the restaurant. Don't get turned off by the older strip mall its in, its worth the stop.

I am fortunate enough to live about 20 steps away from this restaurant. So I try and make it down at least once a week.

My favorite dishes include:

Mussels con frites- Enough to feed a family- no exaggeration. Literally, I shared with my family, ate it as my main course, and boxed up the rest for another meal. The broth is fantastic; I personally prefer a baguette over the fries, but overall an excellent dish.

The almond croissant- INCREDIBLE, they make only a set amount in the morning so you get 'em while they're hot or until they're sold out. Its flaky and light with the perfect amount of sweetness- they truly melt in your mouth. 

Quiche with Spinach and goat cheese- simplistic and savory, my only wish was that it was larger. The crust on it was killer- served with a salad with house dressing (homemade ranch)

Eggs Florentine- One of my favorite benedicts of all time, perfectly sized potions that won't leave you hungry or regretting your last few bites.

French Toast - this was good, but definitely sweet- Its a bruleed version so it has a nice crust to it.

Give this place a try, you won't regret. Perfect for a Sunday morning brunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Crepes are so yummy and coffee is great ! Highly recommend for breakfast ."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place that wouldn't expect to find in a strip mall. The coffee is pretty good (I'm not a coffee drinker, so take that with a huge grain of salt). The prices are a bit high for the food, but makes for a great weekend brunch with a couple of family members or close friends. The pastries are decent enough to try a couple."}
{"text":"We love this place!!!  Never on a wait like many of the breakfast spots in old town and the food is amazing.  The waffle is a must try and not your typical American waffle!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience! Went in for pastries, but stayed for a meal. The space was so inviting and felt like a Parisian cafe. Can't wait to come back and try more here, such a great find!"}
{"text":"This is the first and last visit I will make to this restaurant! Rarely, do I post poor ratings but I feel I must. I ordered Eggs Benedict and an ice tea with lemon. One orders and pays prior to being served. The waitress forgot my lemon and I tried to remind her but she must not have heard me. I asked the other waitress who came to clear the table next to me and she seemed a bit sarcastic with her response. Anyway, I finally got my food and the presentation was very nice. The salad was good and I ate it first then moved onto my eggs. They were tasty and then I took a bite full of what tasted like vinegar. I washed it down with the iced tea and thought it was odd but the portion until that point was good. My next bite resulted in a awful bitter taste that compelled me to spit out my food. I went to the front and told the waitress what happened and said I needed something to cut the awful bitterness. She apologized and I paid for a desert that barely was consumable. It was a lime tart I think as I thought the taste might break the horrible bitterness in my mouth. After I reported the eggs. The response was,\"sorry about that\" , but no concern for my well being. I left with no tip and feeling sick! This is not the appropriate way to handle the situation. I have no idea what was in my food but it was not meant to be I'm sure. Hours later and I have an upset stomach and a bad taste in my mouth for this restaurant. Here I thought I found a little gem in my neighborhood, but what I left with was the thought that I will never return and tell others to beware."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Merci Café for a while so I was pretty excited when it was the place picked for July's International Supper Club UYE!

We were a group of 12, and even with Merci being a small place, our party didn't take up all the room, still was plenty of seating. We were set to meet up at 6pm and around 4pm I learned it was a BYOB, which we love, but didn't have time to get the word out fast enough. 

After checking out the menu I went with an opened faced sandwich, it had turkey, bacon and melted cheese and came with a small salad, The sandwich was good. I also order a side of fries, they were somewhat disappointing to me, but not to Merci's fault, I am just a picky fry person. These fries where on the smaller size and cooked crisp, but my 3 year old grandson thought they were delish and before I knew it he claimed them as his fries.

Service was friendly and our orders came out in a timely matter. Stop by and give Merci Café a try!"}
{"text":"We received a gift certificate as a wedding present, and we are so thankful we did. The food was simply amazing. The chef, Duc, is from France, & his French cooking is wonderful. Everything from the French onion soup, our steak & lamb entrees, and our dessert of merengue & macaroons were totally delicious. Plus, it's BYOB, so we enjoyed our favorite wine with dinner. 
We cannot wait to return & try their breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in old town! This place lives us to the hype of all of the other great reviews it has.  Tucked away in between a Subway and nail salon, you wouldn't expect to find such an authentic French restaurant with a calm atmosphere and BYOB service (and there is a corking fee,  FYI). I've come here quite a few times at different times of the day and I've always thorough enjoyed the food whether it was the beef bourguignon with pasta, a brie sandwich & side salad, or a simple pain au chocolat and some coffee. It may not have the most diverse menu, but EVERYTHING is delicious and worth the money you pay. 

The place itself is on the smaller side, so I've only ever come in a group of 3 max, even though they can accommodate a slightly bigger party. The setting is pretty calm, not loud since you're sitting pretty close to the next table. You pretty much order at the front and then seat yourself but they do come around occasionally to make sure you have everything you need. The chef is really sweet too and once in a while comes out to make sure people are enjoying."}
{"text":"I hate to give 1 star but I just couldn't even like the place.  I was so disappointed by the service and food.  The server did not know the menu or how to make drinks.

1.  Ice coffee:  first cup of coffee:  salt was in the sugar container.  second time:  lots of coffee grinds in the cup.  third time:  the coffee was watered down.  
2.  They were out of spinach, out of croissants, & the eggs were under cooked.
3.  Lorriane quiche was bland and super small

We got the last chocolate croissant.  That was the best from the whole experience.  I hope it was an off day, but I am going to pass and try another place before coming back."}
{"text":"Merci is great, the sweet crepe with Nutella is pretty much the best thing you can do on a Sunday. I've lived up the street for a couple years and have been in and out since, have never had a bad or inconsistent experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here because we were simply walking by. Everything is made by the owner from scratch using real French techniques. For example the bun my burger was on had been made that day in house. The food is cleanly presented and everything taste great. The owner came and sat with us for bit and even gave us a free dessert when we couldn't decide. A great place to eat, we went a bit overboard and spent around $50 on a lunch for two but it felt worth it. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"On our second visit we ordered buckwheat crepes, delicious, quiche also delicious. Good service, clean and fast. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I guess I must've had high expectations  of fruit  tarts and lots of yummy french food. My experience was nothing remarkable  but just pretty average for the most part. I was surprised that for a patisserie  there was not a big variety of desserts or pastries. Regardlesd, the best part of this little place is the customer  service. Our waitress  was just wonderful and so attentive to everything. I ordered the quiche Lorraine  but I was not too impressed  by it and the eggs were a bit runny in it. It came with a little side of spring mix  salad and some hash browns. The side of hash brown was nice and crunchy but maybe too crunchy and greasy for my taste. Everything  was meh but their customer service makes up for it, those ladies are fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the food and all the ideas about what a French restaurant should be like. Fresh flowers, attentive staff, and great outside terrace."}
{"text":"What a quaint little gem! Enjoyed a nice relaxing lunch on the patio with my pooch; my friendly server Alexis even brought out chilled water for my pup. I started with the vegan asparagus soup- holy cow- asparagus soup?! Delish! The dirty chai I had was on point as well as the open faced club. I wrapped up the lunch with a creme' puff with raspberries and the most amazing blueberry lavender infused icecream! 

They offer free wifi and were ok with me sitting on the computer for a while. 

Chill place. Cutest place mats and interior decor. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the Salmond and avocado Crepe, it came with a salad. The dressing was delicious the crepe was a little too think but it tasted good, smoked salmon is usually salty but this was sadly very very salty. 
I hope to try the pastries next time because they looked delicious"}
{"text":"Well worth a stop if in Old Scottsdale... 2 blocks away.  Food was unbelievable... best breakfast parfait ever!!! Pastries also AMA big. Very high end food for reasonable price.  Would come back in a second."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend at Merci today (Sunday). I was shocked that we were only 1 of a few tables and was worried. I ordered the eggs florentine and an almond croissant. WOW. Really, It was awesome! This is a hidden gem! I LOVE that the breakfast is served with a little bit of salad greens too. To put the icing on the cake, the coffee was excellent -- not just regular icky drip coffee. This was some serious, bold, real java! 

We had 2 waitresses...fortunately. The thinner, blond 20-something was really not on the ball, however, the other, shorter, Hawaiian or Japanese server was all business! I think her name is Taylor - definitely this girl has a future in hospitality!"}
{"text":"Sadly I'm forced to write such a negative review based on principle & customer service. Today as I was eating breakfast with my family I saw a bug in my salad. Yes, that's gross but I'm the type of person that can get past that & eat my other food considering we are returning customers & believe the food here is good. However when my husband returned the plate to the counter letting them know there's a bug in the salad very discretely to save them from embarrassment from other customers ordering, the server took the plate to the kitchen with no remorse or apology. We tried to eat considering our 14month old was tired & we were hungry assuming they were figuring something out or may have the manager come out and apologize but nope, still nothing. I could not finish my food more so from being upset at the way we were treated & how this issue was handled ( or wasn't handled for better words) Again, we weren't looking for a free meal considering you pay before you get your food or service but a little apology or something would go a long way. As we were leaving my husband had a word with the server who took the plate back & she admitted she saw it & asked if there's anything she could do AS WE WERE LEAVING so basically she&  management would have let us walked out with not even a simple apology or acknowledgment of the dish. Now at this point he's just as upset as I am as he was giving her the benefit of the doubt. So if you want to feel valued as a customer or not be brushed off upon finding a bug in your food I can NOT recommend dining here. They have lost us as customers based on how the situation was handled more so then the actual bug in my food."}
{"text":"Went here for a linner (lunch/dinner) and it was great! The shopping plaza Merci is located at is undergoing construction-- and has been for awhile. It's right next to a Subway... You're being fair warned... Just prepare your nose for Subway stench assault before you walk into Merci since it sneakily creeps over to their front entrance.  

The cafe is \"cutely\" decorated. I love their bright colored placemats. Menu is to die for. There's something for everyone's different taste buds. I got the asparagus, salmon and mozzarella quiche with side salad. It was delicious and just the right size. Their pastries also looked super delicious in the cold case but my tummy was too full. 

They have a square card reader so when you're done eating just head to the front and pay then you're on your way."}
{"text":"I come here for the escargots ... which are hard to find in the valley ... and they're a garlicky half-dozen sizeable snails, served with a ridiculously large green salad and a roll. Big pluses include a really charming wait staff, French pastries (less sweet, often, than American), and a dog-friendly patio. Quibbles include the fact that people in Paris aren't afraid to season foods with salt ... and these escargots could have used a lot more of it! I also can't fathom a \"real French\" bistro that has no fresh-cut baguettes for sopping up copious amounts of snail butter. Still ... I return!"}
{"text":"Overall, very good dining experience. I would've preferred to be able to order at the tables instead of the counter but that's kind a minor thing. The food was very fresh, cooked well, and delicious to eat.  The service was good but we had to ask for refills for our hot tea. Overall a very good place to eat and would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful presentation, very reasonable prices.  Loved dinner so much I went back for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast special of eggs, bacon, hash-browns, side salad & fruit cup, for under $8!  WOW!"}
{"text":"For our first visit to Merci we decided to go for lunch.  The café was very nice  and pleasant as was the staff. They were friendly and efficient. However, the food was disappointing. The Quiche Lorraine had no taste and the bacon was barely cooked. The crust did not taste fresh and the whole thing had a very greasy feel. It was disappointing. The Italian sandwich was ordinary and needed more prosciutto. We may give Merci another visit but just to try some pastries and coffee."}
{"text":"$4 to split 2 plates. Asked for black tea lemonade and was charged $5. What a ripoff."}
{"text":"Checked out Merci on our recent vacation and returned there with all our friends. It was very hard to return home to Oregon because of this wonderful cafe."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local restaurants. We love brunch because it's never too crowded. Go for the benedicts and the Belgian waffle. If you're there for dinner, you'll likely be greeted personally by the chef. My favorite lunch/dinner option is the caprice burger--so incredibly buttery. Still discovering the menu!"}
{"text":"As I sit here enjoying this gorgeous morning, I can't help but think how beautiful this French cafe is in the middle of this scorching hot desert. The perfectness is almost unreal! Beautiful chandeliers adorn the ceilings, friendly barista to take my order, perfect pastries and silky coffee what more could one ask for? 
I suppose I could ask for some croissants to go? 
Either way, it's heaven in here and I would recommend Merci for your French escape."}
{"text":"It was so nice to see that Chef Duc was able to take a deep breath and re-establish himself as the go-to in delightful dining. Peg and I had dinner at Merci earlier this week and were reminded of how talented this man is. The asparagus coconut cream soup was velvet wonderfulness. From the Croque Madame with egg and bechamel to the chicken in a Dijon mustard and mushroom sauce served with pasta (rice was on the menu but the substitute that he made was superb),  the meal was wonderful. Service was spot-on and visits by the Chef (something he has always done in his other restaurants) were all evidence of his desire to make the experience a great one.  I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Great French dishes, ordered Quiche, French toast, Cheese Omelette, Croque Madame, and Coffee. Good combination actually. The atmosphere is comfy and more family style."}
{"text":"Awesome food. One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. The fries are amazing and the salad dressing is divine. Also: the decor inside is adorable. I wish I would have known about this place sooner."}
{"text":"I just came here today with my daughter for lunch and dessert. This is the most amazing place I have been so far while living in the area. The atmosphere is so welcoming and classy and the food is amazing. The chef/owner is phenomenal, came out twice to make sure everything was OK. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had dinner tonight, I've never had the dinner, only breakfast until now. Our table got the mussels, beef special and salmon. Each was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We've had the award winning chocolate dessert so decided to try the strawberry cheesecake dessert, with a mix that also contained, as my wife said \"the best white chocolate she's had.\" Great night, the chef is really nice and loves talking about food, cooking, and things on general. We loved scratch, we're excited Merci is open now and can't wait to go again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was fast. I will be coming back here again. I highly recommend the burger with the egg on it. (Angus beef, straight from a farm!) It is owner operated and Duc  and Noel were super friendly."}
{"text":"Review is only for the baked goods in take out. Service was pleasant, choco croissant was good , macarons were great, price is lil over $3 but size is big.       

Rum cake tasted dry and like the fridge :(  maybe it was old?  Opera cake was pretty good but had different flavor than most French opera cake .   

Very cute place , it's hidden too . Will come back for their food and give review after that again but for take out pastries and cakes ( which I don't mind spending 5-8$ per French cakes as I love them) I got 2 cakes, 2 macaron , and 2 croissant plus tip was 28$, which isn't bad but would have expected a little more freshness in $5 cakes.       Still love that we have little French bakery here in scottsdale .    Maybe it was a bad day today .

Ohhh main thing, little sad that merci logo on cakes weren't edible (~_~) I like it when they make it chocolate lol I almost ate the paper haha"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I ordered the breakfast sandwich (egg, cheese, & bacon on a croissant). It comes with hash browns and a side salad. Everything was very tasty, although I didn't eat the side salad, just didn't seem ideal at 9 am. Prices were okay, not bad for the amount of food you get, I think the breakfast sandwich was around $8. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Open for dinner and has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Awesome food. We ordered the rib eye dinner which was delicious tender and covered in a creamy sauce. I ordered the open faced brie sandwich it came with a delicious salad. Best of all they have crepes and macarons and a variety of other pastries. The hostess and chef were very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"We ordered the French Toast and breakfast sandwich and really enjoyed both dishes. The French Toast was very rich and very tasty which complimented the savory breakfast sandwich very well. We also had a chocolate croissant that was amazing. Overall, really cute place and very good food (especially the croissants). Will definitely come back for lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe. Not exactly French but more of an interpretation. Prices were average and food was good and fresh tasting. Staff was very friendly and helpful. 
We'll stop by again if we are in the area but won't go out of our way."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Merci. I had their croissants at his office. It was the real deal. Based on that alone I booked our Belgian club's holiday dinner there. Noel, the owner's wife was incredibly helpful in setting up the dinner for the group of about 23. 

The group had high praise for the food, and the desserts were especially amazing. The restaurant is charming and decorated much like the old patisseries in Europe. The chef has an eye for presentation that is reflected in how the food and desserts are presented. 

The staff was super friendly and allowed us to finish up our gathering post closing time. Merci is conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale with ample free parking. and although in a dated strip mall, once inside you are transported to a charming cafe straight out of Paris."}
{"text":"A bit of french heaven in the middle of the desert. We have been twice and both times food was delicious! 

The comments below on how service can be a bit slow makes me laugh - slow down, enjoy your food. It is typical in France for people to sit at a table for over 2 hours. We had a great experience however with the wait staff. The chef came out personally both times to greet us and ask about our orders. 

I am addicted to their crab cake burger, and I really want to try the boeuf bourguignon. The amount of food we received with our orders (most of us had sandwichs/ burgers and they were served with fries and a side salad) was very plentiful and I was unable to finish each time. They also have mussels and fries fresh in every Thursday - but he only orders a few so call in if you want to reserve an order! The deserts are all delicious and takes me right back to a real french boulangerie. 

I love that this little gem, it offers a tranquil ambience that you will not find in other typical restaurants. Great find on our part and so happy it is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Merci! Yesterday I had the lobster bisque and a salad. Give Merci a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Egg Benedict perfection, cappuccino loveliness. My cap's foam stands up through my entire breakfast.  I come once a week and can't seem to move past the Benni it's that good!

The Lobster salad is bursting with flavor and Not loaded down with extra gobs of mayo.  Everything I've had is great.  The bread for the open faced sandwiches has a nice crust, is somewhat dense providing an excellent base.  The Croque Madame has thick cut ham and a perfectly cooked egg, the bread brought the Caprese to a whole other level with the deviation from a typical Italian style bread.  The Italian was good but next time I'll order it without bacon.  I do wish they had nice thick tomato slices rather than cherry tomatoes.

My only other criticism is I wish they opened earlier.  When coming right at 9 it sometimes seems like it takes them a while to get up and going.  Today my benni took 30 mins.  Don't get me wrong, I'm hooked and it's worth waiting for but definitely a pass on work days."}
{"text":"French cuisine fast and affordable.  Worth a try, if you're feeling brave!  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cute place, had the Belgian waffles and a breakfast sandwich. The waffles are to die for... I've had authentic Belgian waffles in Europe and they taste just like them. The owner is also extremely friendly and energetic.

I wasn't as impressed with the breakfast sandwich. It was OK but nothing special, I probably wouldn't order it again.

All in all, I recommend visiting for the waffles if nothing else!"}
{"text":"I am native French, so I know authentic French food or close to it. The Croque Madame and the Quiche were not good. We came here in the middle of the week for lunch. There was only one girl working the register AND as the waitress. She seemed overwhelmed but it doesn't mean she should take it out on the customers.  She wasn't very helpful when I asked questions about the menu, given it was our first time there. It's a cute place though."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very rude! We are new in the area! They were Not Welcoming at all.
They treated us like we should know how There bistro worked! Poor service:( 
Left without eating!"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for YEARS.  I didn't really pay any attention because it's located in a strip mall, next to a Subway.   I went with a friend not expecting much and boy was I wrong!
YOu walk in and it's adorable.  Vintage photos of the various arondissments of Paris, photos of the owner's modeling photos from France, chandeliers, you name it.  

There are a variety of specials and I\"m hoping that the Ahi Tuna salad becomes permanent!  (hint hint)

The restaurant offers a traditional french menu:  french onion soup, omelettes, quiches, sweet and savory crepes, out of the world deserts including tartes, fresh croissants, macaroons... it's got it all.  
I\"m slowly working my way through the menu and I've never been disappointed.  The french onion soup is out of control and I've also had the truffle burger and lamb burger.  Perfection.
Their croissants are light, buttery and oh so bad for you, but worth it.

They do have different hours, so double check.   For dinner, you can also BYOB for a small corkage fee."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The service was friendly but grossly incompetent. My husband and I arrived and there was not a table available. After about 10 minutes several tables left and a table was cleaned and we were seated. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes with no menus. I went to the counter. There was a person standing there that did not acknowledge me until I asked for menus.  I took the menus back to my table and we sat there for another 10 minutes waiting to place  our order. At this point I was confused as to how I was supposed to order. I went to the counter again to ask if I was supposed to order there. A server came over to take our order. After our order was placed, I noticed that 2 tables that had come in after us were already eating. Our food arrived and was very good. The owner came out during our meal and checked to see if we were enjoying our food. The server never returned for drink  refills.  We finished eating our meals and sat there for a long time waiting for our plates to be cleared and for our check. The restaurant had slowed down considerably from the time of our arrival. There were two servers standing around chatting and one playing on her cellphone. I went to the counter again and asked for the check. The girl playing with her cellphone says she can close out my check and then proceeds to ask me for each item that has been ordered.  It is a shame that we were not given even basic service. The food really was good, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Second time I wanted to make Merci work.  One server so service was none.  After sitting at the table  (which I had to seat myself) for ten minutes, I found the server in the back, placed my order.  Went back for coffee and water after another ten minutes.  Had to ask for a refill.  No Service!  Now the food!  I had Quiche Lorraine.  I will let the picture speak for itself.  Yes....that's the bacon in the Quiche.  Not cooked at all!

Matter of time before their doors are CLOSED for good!"}
{"text":"We called ahead on Friday to ask if they could accommodate us as a group of 10 on a Saturday morning. They very graciously took our information and let us know they'd be ready for us. We weren't aware at the time that it was a sort of quick service type eatery (order at the counter and they deliver to your table) however, that worked so well because we were a large group but paying separately.

The food was amazing. I stole a bite of my daughters' croissant and wow! Melt in your mouth good! Not super crusty and dry but chewy and flaky and amazing. I shared an omelet with my mom, which was served with these great hashbrowns (the kind that are crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside) as well as a side salad with a light ranch. All was very good. The veggies were very fresh (spinach, mushrooms and peppers) and the eggs were organic. 

I also had one of those cream puffs that are shaped like a swan. So good! Some kind of amazing caramel layer at the bottom that was incredible! My iced latte was ok. Not overly sweet but it was almost too weak. Not their fault because she did tell me they could do a double if I wanted. 

What was cool was that while we were seated and being served our food, some of us added additional sides and things to our meals and they were kind enough to do that without us having to go back to the counter. So when we were done, and ready to ask for some croissants and macaroons to go, we paid for the additional items. 

The staff was all awesome and friendly. Downside on the set up is that with the paying ahead, I tipped only 15%, which is appropriate for a place like this for brunch. But they were so great, I would have tipped 20% had I paid at the end. 

To go we grabbed a couple of macarons. We didn't care for the sea salt caramel but I loved the chocolate. I also wish I had asked for more croissants to go. Also, they were out of chocolate croissants, which was a bummer. 

It wasn't overly crowded which tells me this jewel hasn't quite been discovered yet. I wish we lived closer to be able to take advantage of that. :( But on the other side, I'll look forward to visiting when we head up to Scottsdale for whatever reason. 

*** I just remembered that I had ordered an almond croissant in place of a chocolate one to be served with our breakfast and they never brought it. ;( BUT I'm pretty sure they undercharged us when we added croissants and macarons at the end, so I suppose it evens out. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place... It is now 2:06 on Sunday. They close at 2:00 on Sundays. Two tables just walked in. Kat ran back to the kitchen and asked if the chef/owner could stay and cook for the two new tables. I've never seen a wait staff so eager to please customers. Duke, the owner/chef is staying open for those tables. These people really care. I love it here! And the salmon burger Rocks!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with a good friend, and it's now our favorite spot. Such a lovely little cafe! The coffee is fabulous, the desserts are beautiful. The front outside patio is very nice. 
I cannot review the food, since we've only had coffee and dessert, but we love what we have had. We will be back on a regular basis, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Immediately placed an order of French hot chocolate with a little whipped cream on the side, but was told a few minutes later that the kitchen had run out.

Rib-eye cooked RARE.  Chef personally asked me to  let my server know next time what my temperature preference is.  Why was I not given the option in the first place?  I was not asked on last year's UYE visit either, and that was cooked medium and came out so tender.  Also, creamy sauce was very salty,  but I was hungry.  Frites were perfect!  (Rare do I find perfectly-crisped yet tender \"frites,\" but here they really are.)

Nutella crepe with banana, which I'd RAVED about in the previous 4-star review posted came out without any caramelization; was tepid in temperature; and garnished with not-quite-ripe banana slices.

Message received crystal-clear: my business isn't wanted here.  Au revoir!

p.s.  I was so excited to come in tonight that I even planned to swing by here in two days' time to grab a cup of hot chocolate to gift to a pastry chef that wanted to make amends for a recent visit my friends and I paid to another business.  She'd told me that she was now craving for French hot chocolate after reading about my praise for Merci's version.  I'm sorry pastry chef, but I will not give my hard-earned money to a business owner/chef who has ill feeling towards me, and for what, I do not know, since I posted a four-star review for Merci previously."}
{"text":"Wow... All I can say is wow. I got the French toast and have never had anything like it before. It completely melts in your mouth and the banana flavor is superb. Great service and the chef even walked the floor and made sure to speak with everyone personally. It really made the experience feel personal and authentic. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"In from out of town, stopped at 3 other dessert places prior too. Showed up 18 minutes before closing, they refused our business, and said they already closed the register... (We just wanted some desserts to go) Nice thanks a lot. I guess we won't try it! Ever!"}
{"text":"The brie, cranberries, and walnut sandwhich was absolutely delicious! The placw has a very warm, vintage feel and the service was excellent. 

Thank you! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast w salad and hash browns for $6.95. Excellent coffee w free refills w/o asking. Fresh baguettes made w flour from Paris. Please patronize  Duc, former fashion photographer from Paris. Dinner served till 8 pm. BYOWine. Tres Bien!"}
{"text":"I was going to write a scathing review of this place but I changed my mind when the chef personally came out to diffuse the situation. All has been forgiven and my review score has been based 100% on just the food.

Before I explain what happened, let's first talk about the food.

Their croissants are really quite a special little treasure of Scottsdale. Buttery, crisp perfection. I could have easily gobbled up three of these golden babies.

The breakfast sandwich was a tad salty for my taste but is still a great choice.

The eggs benedict were cooked very well but I thought the hollandaise was slightly lacking. I think it needs a tad bit more tanginess and a little bit more in portion. I actually had to ask for little bit extra on the side. 

I can see why locals love coming here. It's a really cozy and quaint place with super solid food.

So why were we so incredibly upset at first?

The group arrived at 10:30 am. 

We were not asked for our order till 11:00 am. The restaurant was NOT full. There was no line out there. They simply forgot about us. 

By 11:40 am (over an hour had passed since we were seated), we never received our food and tables that came just 15 mins ago (11:25 am) received their food. 

At that point, I was furious and the first server I approached had the utmost terrible response to me. There was no apology at all. Rather, she merely responded, \"Well, maybe you ordered something really special that took a long time to make.\" That response made no sense. I ordered a smoked salmon benedict. And timing of the gods couldn't have been better because right when she said this, I turned around and pointed to another patron ---she came in about 45 mins after us -- just got the exact dish I ordered. I pointed to the dish and said, \"My dish was not special. Oh look. There's the smoked salmon benedict that I ordered. That lady is already eating it and she came in 45 mins after us.\" I was floored. No apology. Nothing.

As it turned out....our order was never put in and we'd already been patiently waiting for over an hour.

The rest of the staff was really wonderful in trying to make up for the situation. They profusely apologized and even brought some free croissants. The chef even came out and apologized--not once--but twice! He even brought us out some homemade jam. We gladly accepted his sincere apology and forgave very quickly. 

I have to commend the chef and his staff (with the exception of that single server) for taking the time to make it up to us. In the end, it all worked out and I decided to give a review based 100% on the food, as opposed to the experience (which would have resulted in a 1 star review). 

I hope management seeks to contact me so that she/he may work with that single server that failed the business. That server needs to be better trained on problem solving and customer service."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place. It is super cute, delicious food, great service, and the chef/owner was wonderful. We came for dinner tonight and will definitely be back for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now & really like it!

It's a small little cafe that has kind of a \"homey\" feel at the end of a strip mall. 

I've tried a couple of the quiches (both of which were very good) as well as a nutella crepe & of course a chocolate croissant. The quiches (as well as the other breakfast items I believe) come w/a side salad & hashbrowns. The hashbrowns are so tasty! They're crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. That's how I like them. 

I really liked the crepe I had as well. Funny enough, the one thing I've tried here that I kind of shrugged my shoulders at was the croissant. I mean, it was good, but I guess I was expecting something that was going to blow me away since I was getting it at a French pastry place as opposed to a run of the mill coffee shop. 

I believe the dessert pastries in the front counter change regularly, and one time they had this sugary, meringue thing that I brought home and it was so good! It was EXTREMELY sweet, but I loved it!

The service here is friendly. It's a pretty tiny place & you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Merci? Thank you? Well, actually no thank you and we'll be taking our money elsewhere moving forward. Here's why:

We arrived at Merci around 1:00pm to enjoy some lunch. In arriving to the cute little French cafe, the decor is bright and lively. So far so good. So naturally we would have such high hopes for the meal and service. 

Service: Horrendous. It started off okay, the waitress mentioned all of the specials from mussels to ahi sandwich etc. I ordered mussels with fries as it sounds divine while the boyfriend ordered a prosciutto sandwich. It takes her a few minutes to run back and state that their mussels ran out. That's fine, it happens. I went ahead and ordered the other special, Ahi sandwich. Which the waitress disappeared to put my order in. After about 15 minutes of waiting for our food, a different waitress came back and first states \"don't hate us, but we don't have that either.\" At this point, it was ridiculous. Why would it take you so long to realize there wasn't enough to Tuna?? Secondly, why would you include that in your special when you spoke with us if you're OUT? The communication from the kitchen to the wait staff was obviously lacking. Disappointing. 

Meal: Finally our sandwiches arrived. We both were starving and hoping for the food to at least be better than the service. NOPE. We both opt out of the salad for the fries. First off, the fries were cold. Like it was fried this morning and they were even too lazy to reheat. The sandwiches were SAD! It's was like a reheated school lunch! Come on!! I thought this is a French cafe....what happened? Oh and while we try to eat our lackluster sandwiches, nothing from the waitress to see how we're doing. ZERO. NOT A PEEP. No care at all. They stood there chatting away. 

Overall, don't waste your time. We stopped here for pastries in the past and that was fairly good. But obviously the food and service sucked."}
{"text":"Allons-y to Merci! Attended my first International Supper Club here; much thanks to the lovely Monica O. for setting it up! The interior is adorable, with crystal chandeliers and French inspired accents on the wall. The menu is a mix of baked goods, sandwiches, salads, soups, and in the evenings from Wednesday to Saturday they offer a selection of entrees for dinner.

After browsing through the menu I decided to be as French as I could be (Without the miming and the funny little hats), ordering the French onion soup ($8.50) and the salade nicoise ($11.25). The soup came out first, piping hot, with a cheesy mixture of cheddar and swiss on top, slightly caramelized. It was salty and rich, but I wasn't a big fan of the crouton (Which was a tad too gummy tasting for me when it came out) and the cheese (I like Gruyere better as the topping). The broth itself was decent, but I recently ate at Coup des Tartes which has an amazing French onion soup which this version doesn't quite compare to. This version was more one dimensional and thus had a less rounded taste to it. There were also less caramelized onions in this version.

The salad came out and looked like a tub of greens it was so big! It was filled to the brim with crisp vegetables, mixed greens, olives, tuna, and a side of creamy dressing. Looking at photos of other versions of salade nicoise I was surprised this one was so creamy, since the tuna was more like a creamy tuna salad, and the dressing wasn't very vinaigrette-like. I think I would have preferred a more traditional version of this salad, one that was more tangy than creamy. To each their own though!

We ended the meal sharing a rum baba and the special dessert of the moment, the mogador. The rum baba was a dense cake soaked in a light sugary rum sauce. I loved the candied citrus in the cake. The more I ate of it though the more it got too sweet for my taste buds though. The mogador was interesting. I enjoyed the combination of raspberry with chocolate, but the whipped topping didn't really have a lot of flavor and was hard, approaching frozen status in the center.

Overall I had a lovely night though. Much thanks to the restaurant for providing the ideal venue to have great conversations with other Yelpers while enjoying French food."}
{"text":"Croissants are off the hook good. French toast is excellent. Coffee was good. Service needs to be evaluated and tweaked.

The young ladies running the front had a bit of a hard edge. They warmed up after a few moments if small talk. The interchange with the table next to us was a bit alarming as well...but the table of old hens were not very nice and could have used some lessons in manners.

The big knock (-3 points) is directed towards management. We walked in at 7 PM that same day with 6 people in our party wanting to be seated for dinner. It was my daughters birthday. We were discouraged from staying and were not seated. We were told that management wanted to shut down early because it was slow. Six people with full meals and deserts would have been sizable business for this small place. More so, it would have been good Bussiness practice to seat a party that arrives an hour before closing.
I was disappointed as was my daughter.

Want a croissant and some French attitude...this is your place. ;-)
I wish our experience was different but it wasn't...it was what we experienced."}
{"text":"Was referred to this restaurant by a friend who raved about it.  We went in a few weeks ago on a Sunday and the place was just starting to fill up.  Wife loved the decor and it was quaint in a cool french cafe kind of way.  Had the egg sandwich on a croissant. Was absolutely delicious.  Served with a small size salad and some hash browns, it was a lot more food than I was expecting.  Wipe had the eggs Benedict, and they were good as well served with the same salad and hash browns.

Croissants were amazing.  Only tried the butter,  but they had chocolate and another flavor or two which I can't recall right now. 

Word to the wise: get there early to get croissants as when we were there,  they sold out.  Also, it looks like it pays to know the owner and be a regular. Witnessed a customer come in, order croissants to go, followed by a regular who knew the owner and ordered those same croissants.  Since there was only a limited amount,  the person who had ordered to go and had already paid was denied half his order and the reasoning was someone had \"reserved\" the croissants before.  Sounds a little shady to me.

Service could have been a bit quicker as we sat there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be served,  and then another 15 minutes waiting for our dishes to be cleared and for the bill. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"My pregnant wife was craving a breakfast croissant sandwich and it was past the 11:30 a.m. deadline. I knew I couldn't walk out empty-handed, so I begged and pleaded the owner to let me buy the croissants. He not only made me fresh croissants, he threw in a chocolate croissant for free and wished me congratulations. Also, the food was delicious. This restaurant may be the greatest gift the French have ever given America."}
{"text":"This place would have been great, but the service was TERRIBLE! There were two of them, and when I sat down looked at the menu, I waited for about 20min before I decided to just get up and leave...they saw me looking at them to get my order, they didn't even ask if I wanted anything to drink. It looked rly nice and I saw the food looked good, but the service. Pissed me off, because they both saw me eye to eye looking at them."}
{"text":"It's like a piece of Paris in Scottsdale. The food is superb, the sauce on the ribeye steak transported me back to France."}
{"text":"Better for breakfast or lunch with nice croissants large coffee cups refilled for free. Quiche plate has a flaky crust and a small green salad on the side. Dinner was disappointing with nobody at my table happy with their meal. My beef bourgogne had a thin watery au jus instead of a rich brown Gravy."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and both of us loved it. It's a really cute little cafe, with friendly service. Prices are very fair for the portions. Crab cake and fries were delicious and so was the croque madame. Deserts are lovely. Great place, looking forward to trying breakfast."}
{"text":"I think we came on a bad day, it was extremely busy. The food did not take a very long time considering the full house, I don't have an issue with the speed. The service needed help though, I had to ask the waitress to bring the drink that came with the kids meal (kid is 19 months), and was brought in a regular cup which is impossible to give to her. We asked for a cup with a lid and got one, and had to ask for a spoon for her macaroni but never got one, so we went and got one from the counter. Meals came all at different times. My egg on the Croque Madame was undercooked, meaning the white of the egg was clear, so I brought it back up for a little more cooking. They said sorry and took it back, and I let the expediter/runner know what happened and she said the french undercook all their food, \"but thanks for letting us know\". Hahahaha. The Nicoise salad is not grilled tuna, it's tuna salad. We had to ask for the french fries we ordered. We never got the fruit that was supposed to come with the kids meal. The waitress said the macaroni is cooked from scratch but it's Annies shells n cheese (I don't care but it made me laugh). The croque madame is over seasoned (thyme?) so you can't taste the ham, egg or cheese.
My friend found some crayons and coloring pages to occupy my daughter. I felt that my friend was more helpful than the actual waitress.
I went home and googled how the french cook their eggs (in french!) and could not find any photos of raw eggs. I see a picture here of the egg on a burger and it's properly cooked so I don't think the whites are normally left uncooked. Anyway, I think it was a bad day and the waitress must have no experience with kids. I do feel bad, the owner was very nice. But I didn't enjoy the meal :("}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here today. We never knew this little real French Cafe existed. It is so authentic. We had most delicious Eggs Benedict. We met the Owner; he was so gracious.  Our lovely French waitress gave us an in house almond croissant to take home; how sweet!  We loved the atmosphere!  We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh i just LOVE the rich food they have here. Soups, amazing. Salad, light and delish. Ambience quaint and cute."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place! The croissant breakfast sandwich is delicious and the place is just adorable!"}
{"text":"Raisin croissant was quite tasty. However , the salmon crepe and quiche were uninspired and the hash brown potatoes serve red with the meal came out barely warm.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place near the W Scottsdale to get coffee, closest place was this or coffee Bean and tea leaf. I elected to try this out. Staff was friendly. Croissants were fresh and hot. Coffee excellent, five stars. Actually, the staff was so friendly it blew my mind. I normally don't Yelp from the parking lot but had to in this case."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Merci I feel like I have been transplanted to another world. The food, drink, and pastries are some of the best in the valley. They have consistently good service and great prices for what they provide. At my most recent visit I learned that they even do BYOB with wine. Even better! Thanks for the great spot Duc!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place. The crepes (ham, egg and cheese) were yummy but the French dip sandwich my husband had was a 10! The ambiance is nice and although it's a little pricey it is worth it."}
{"text":"Such a sweet spot! Came in for lunch and a top notch hazelnut latte and yummy crepes, absolutely will be coming back and can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"YUM! I got the eggs florentine, boyfriend got the smoked salmon Benedict and friend got breakfast sandwich. All delicious and beautifully presented. Only downfall was wait time... Felt like it should've been quicker.. But worth the wait overall."}
{"text":"Best croissant outside Europe - flaky and buttery 
Latte was perfect
Yogurt for once was plain - thank you for not ruining it by sugarifying it ;) lots of yummy berries on top"}
{"text":"I don't even know what makes the food so good here, but even the simple items are amazing. My husband and I had dinner and brunch here and both of us are continually blown away by the rich flavors of our dishes. 

The ice cream for dessert and again, the flavors! It isn't just chocolate, but a rich chocolate with cinnamon and a bergamot ice cream.  Just amazing. I highly recommend this place for any meal, I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the crab cake sandwich and it was just okay. The fries and the salad that accompanied the sandwich were just okay. They were very basic, plain and boring. The crab cake was very moist, which is great, but I'd prefer a crunchy breading. The bread that it was on was delicious!  That was the best part of the meal, but it was so thick!  I could only eat one side of the bun. The atmosphere inside seemed a bit to pretentious for me, but the patio was nice.  I won't be back, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend giving it a try, just get something other than the sandwich I had and sit outside if you can."}
{"text":"Came because of a show called Check Please on PBS and they raved about the lobster roll. Both of us decided to have that. I also ordered the herbed frites (French fries). I love lobster and this was good however it seems I'm always disappointed when I get it in a roll. Maybe it's the bread. Glad I got the fries cuz they were delicious! 

Server was a bit unfriendly. My friends plate came out way before mine did. Even tho we ordered the same thing at the same time. When it did come the blonde gal that delivered it said \"it takes time to make it\". The brunette cashier was very friendly and made up for the snotty blonde.

Forgot to mention that I got the leek quiche to go for breakfast the next day and really enjoyed it. Crust was flakey and ingredients inside were yummy.

I grew up eating frog legs and they had it on the menu here so I will be back one day to try those also. Come on...get past it...tastes like chicken. Really

Lastly, get there at least 30min before they close or they will turn you away. We saw them tell a 4 top they were closed. Funny, usually in the US if you come 5 min before close you will still be served."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! The owner/cook is the kindest man. He is so attentive to his customers. His passion really shows with his food and all of his creations."}
{"text":"Between 3 and 4 stars.....ordering was a mess for a party of 8 but once we could retreat to the tables out front the food was pretty great....standouts were lamb burger, soup of the day (potato leek w/bacon) and Caprese salad, nice homemade Ranch dressing on the greens, tuna salad was good not great. Latte was half the size of the mug. Owner came out to greet us which was a nice addition."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem in Scottsdale.  Interesting cafe that's next to Subway.   Owner is friendly and helpful.   Delicious hand made buttery croissants."}
{"text":"See all the 5 star reviews?  This cafe earns them.  

I ate here 2X. Breakfast & dinner.  Both meals were tasty, refined, nice portion, pretty on the plate.  

Small selection on a focused menu. Best quality ingredients used.

For dinner, bring your own wine bottle (be a sport - a good wine).  Corkage: $8.

Charming!"}
{"text":"Drove from Surprise to try some pastries from Merci and double checked the website to make sure they would be open when we arrived. Posted closing time was 3pm and we arrived at 2:30 pm. When we got to the front door, we were rudely told by the man at the front counter that they were closed and he proceeded to shoo us out of the restaurant. 

My husband told him that he might want to change the sign on the front of the restaurant or the website because both list the closing time as 3pm. As my husband was talking, the restaurant employee very rudely interrupted him again saying that the restaurant was closed. I told the employee that we were there to order pastries and asked him if purchasing pastries was possible. He responded, still rudely, that we could buy pastries, but the kitchen was closed. 

We ordered pastries which, to be honest, were sub par. Since we did not order food, I can not speak to how the food is. What I can say with all certainty is that I will not be back to Merci as our mere presence was treated as a massive inconveniece. 

My advice to the management of Merci, is, you might want to provide a more welcoming atmosphere to your customers and relay the importance of good customer service to your employees. Also, if you stop serving food at 2:30, make 2:30 your closing time."}
{"text":"Really nice interior inside.  Lots of options to choose from. I ordered the Quiche Lorraine and a croissant.   The croissant was top notch, however, the quiche was disappointing.  Quiche was lukewarm, very small bits of meat, and the texture of the crust was mushy and off.   Probably won't return as my bill was close to 15 bucks with tip."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have eaten here for breakfast, dinner, and many a pastry. The quality of the food is EXCELLENT. I am a pastry snob and this place is delicious. When we ate dinner here, I had a chocolate tart at the end and I'm still thinking about it months later. For dinner, you bring your own wine, so note that if you're doing dinner. The service is almost always great. The owners are super friendly when we bring our kids in for breakfast (they have kids of their own). Great place. The only downside is location, next to a stinky subway. C'est la vie!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere followed by elegant and delicious food !! Not your ordinary cafe here ;) highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very adorable ambience. Besides that the owner brought put my food, served me water and the place is quaint and sweet. I had a quiche, large portion. Dessert was pricey but tasty. I wonder what their coffee tastes like!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The food was extremely fresh, well made and full of flavor. Latte was perfect. If I lived in Scottsdale I would visit here often."}
{"text":"Great small cafe, located outside the hustle and bustle of Old Town Scottsdale. I had coffee and a pastry while working on my laptop and the environment was quite nice. The food was all made from scratch and the service was very polite. Might be my new work spot! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We come here every year during my birthday week. I'm sad to see their ranch dressing go, haven't eaten much salad since. Use to buy it by the jar :) but no more.  Still the food is always amazing. No matter what you order you won't be disappointed.  In 2015 Chef Duck actually opened just for us , he was there alone baking.  He made us a lovely birthday lunch and we had a nice chat about tiramisu. I really want to come back for the dinner specials.  They look yummy."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here and it was fabulous!  The French onion soup is the best I have ever had anywhere. I'd give them 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I popped in here yesterday for lunch. I visit the Cosmo prof pretty often so I've really been wanting to try this place!! Walking in you feel like you're at a modern day French café. I love all the decor. Initially I thought I wanted to do takeout (which is an awesome plus!) but I decided to dine-in for a full experience. 

I ordered the Club, which is an open-faced sandwich including: turkey, avocado, pesto and bacon topped with melted Swiss cheese. It also comes with a small, but nice side salad made with greens, tomatoes and ranch. The sandwich was great and the whole meal was a perfect portioned lunch. I also had to get dessert (don't skip!) which was out of their pastry case. It was a chocolate layered mousse with raspberry. I forget the exact name but it came in a little square container, topped with a raspberry. It was chilled and delicious!! It totally satisfied my sweet tooth. Overall I would definitely come back and bring a friend! It looks like there's so many, even more, scrumptious dishes + desserts to experience!"}
{"text":"A nice little place with many obvious regulars.  I pretty much loved everything, from the single server/single cook (I went on a Tuesday I think, kind of slow) the nicely priced food, and the almost obnoxious but just right decor.  My food itself was really nice, looked great, tasted great, all that.  There were only 2 tiny details that cost them a star (I know, big deal, right?) And that was my poached eggs were dripping in water,  like little water pockets, and the holandaise for my Benedict was practically not there.  I had to lift my egg to see if there was even any on it.  BUT, it was still good.  I'll come back, with people even.  :)"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back here again soon. It was eclectic and delicious. My absolute favorite was the veggie soups with coconut milk; it was phenomenal!  The duck was good and the desert was super rich and flavorful. Equally as interesting, the chef is quite the world traveler and excellent pho grapher.  This is my new favorite French restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Old Town!!! The owner and chef is French. And he makes everything from scratch!! Even the ice cream!! Literally everything on the menu is always cooked just right with so much flavor. You can tell the owner takes pride in his work and his food. He always comes out to greet me and say thank you for coming in too! 

Try the Croque Madame, the French Onion soup, and the macarons! There's also sometimes a special on the special board with chicken and a mushroom sauce that is to die for. :) But my ultimate fave is the Tripe Chocolate pudding dessert. 

I love supporting local places and this place is one of my faves to support because of how great the owner and the food are!!"}
{"text":"We came to merci cafe for the ambiance but we were blown away by the service and the food!! 
 Highlights:

i got the kobe burger with brioche bun and frites. The brioche bun was soo good with a flaky crust it tasted like a french biscuit almost. Truffles frites were also tasty and finished with in seconds

French onion soup salty

For dessert we had the chefs special with pistachio mousse layered with strawberry mousse.  It wasn't too sweet and was super smooth.  You must try this!

Can't wait to come back for their weekend menu. The chef & wife team were very nice. The chef came to talk to us when we had dessert & said he only uses Belgium chocolate for his desserts. We were very happy & bellies full. Merci!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended, great food! Everything I've had here is delicious, love the burgers and desserts."}
{"text":"I will be back!!!  Very unassuming place in a strip mall (I'm a sucker for finding hole in the wall gems)...the place is adorable inside!!!  I had the eggs benedict which was presented adorably and tasted even better.  The coffee was fantastic and service was friendly.  One of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST French onion soup in the valley.  Made to order and absolutely delicious.  Cafe is quaint and comfortable, service friendly and welcoming.  Also had the lamb burger as well as the spinach and goat cheese quiche.  Both were memorable as well.  Found a new little neighborhood spot I'll be returning to frequently!"}
{"text":"It simply does not get better than Merci and the masterpieces Duc provides. The most generous of spirit chef you'll find, Duc puts his heart and soul into crafting perfect plates of amazing from Scratch. 

Everything is of the finest quality and honestly the most delicious preparation. Homemade buns and sauces for the burgers, the best quality beef and turkey and lamb, insanely great sandwiches and salads: you won't regret a single item on the menu.

His dinners are no different: insanely high quality at a price point that honestly doesn't make sense. It's so affordable you wonder how there isn't a line out the door, and perhaps consider not telling your friends to keep it that way, but it's just so good that you can't keep it to yourself.

Do yourself a favor and take a few friends to Merci for a wonderful lunch. Do call if you head over for dinner; they're still establishing their firm dinner hours, so letting them know you're coming during their tentative dinner hours (on Wed-Sat) is a good idea.

They'll take amazing care of you. And try the pastries. They'll blow you away as an encore."}
{"text":"There isn't anything that I didn't like about my meal and my experience at Merci.  The patio is dog friendly, they even had water out for Fido. The service was sweet and attentive, and the food was French and delicious.  They had *my favorite thing* - almond croissants!  I am going back, and happy that I can bring my dog along!"}
{"text":"Had such high hopes for this place! Yelp reviews and pictures made it look like a superb little place for lunch. When we walked in the decor was lovely. Was expecting a larger pastry selection(being used to real French cafes they have a huge colorful selection!) the items displayed in the cases looked old and store bought. Macarons are meant to be in a refrigerated case so seeing them in little baggies on the counter was quite weird. My significant other ordered a $14.95 black truffle burger and it was definitely not worth the price. The bottom bun was soggy and looked gross. I told him to send it back but he felt bad. I ordered the Brie sandwich and my salad didn't even come with the dressing or any tomatoes like in the pictures or like my boyfriends meal. He had to walk up to the counter to get dressing and we never got a refill on our drinks so the service was horrible. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a little cafe that is well worth the drive in my opinion. Everything from the pastries to breakfast and lunch items are first rate. The owner Duc is very passionate about his craft and always takes the time to talk to customers and get their feedback.

It takes me about 20 minutes to drive to Merci and in French: \"Ca vaut la peine d'aller si loin pour manger si bien.!\"

I had lunch there today with a  friend and we both had the same \"Special\" of the day...which was an open faced lamb BLT...it came with salad and French fries and it was to die for. Also had an Opera for dessert and it was really yummy. The staff: Kat, Nathalie and Elizabeth are first rate and very warm and welcoming.

Merci is also open for dinner several times a week - However  I have not tried t yet.

Thank you...\"Merci\" for an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great location, sweet ambience and the good is delicious.  Great to stop by for pastries and coffee or for a full breakfast."}
{"text":"So thrilled to have found a place that has an amazing quiche! The special of the day was scallop and bacon, which was flavorful, smooth, and had a flaky crust. Unfortunately, the salad provided made the plate wet and the bottom of the quiche soggy. My husband had a waffle that was made with the most delicious batter; topped with fresh fruit and whipped cream
The major disappointment we had was the creme brûlée was separated and had a scrambled egg flavor. It was returned and replaced with a milk chocolate tart that was amazing. The tart shell was firm and layered with caramel and chocolate. 
We're excited to try this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I walk here Saturday or Sunday mornings for their fresh coffee, croissants right out of the oven, delicious breakfast sandwiches, and of course I leave with a handful of macaroons to munch on for later!
Everything my hubby and I have gotten from here has been delicious and keeps us coming back.
We can't wait to try out their lunch or din din menu."}
{"text":"Very quaint and cute.  Great place to get brunch on a Sunday.  The food was amazing, the pumpkin pancakes were the best pancakes I've ever had, seriously."}
{"text":"Finally headed back to this restaurant after a long hiatus (they closed for a bit and I may have forgotten about them once they reopened, my bad for sure).  We were happy to see that the menu was a bit updated but it really was the same great place it was before.  

We have only been here for breakfast and it is always good.  The egg dishes are what I typically go for and I am rarely disappointed.  If you enjoy sweet breakfasts do try Merci's french toast.  It is different but different in a very good way.  Their coffee is great quality and honestly, sometimes I enjoy heading over to Merci just to enjoy a great cup of coffee along side a freshly baked croissant (or chocolate croissant...)."}
{"text":"Quaint place with sweet service.
Duck confit was dry. Beef a poivre was chewy. Shrimp linguini was excellent.  Salads were nice. French bread missing.  Desserts were average and expensive. On balance, pricey for what is offered."}
{"text":"This is a very nice cafe. The atmosphere really sets to this French setting and makes in style. Chandeliers, a big sign and very nice pictures around the place. The employees really do take care of the customers. Always trying to help out and are very kind. Beef with carrots and it was very delicious. For dessert had the salted caramel ice cream which was fantastic. The coffee was great. I loved everything that was going on in this cafe. Well done!"}
{"text":"Second time here- the chef and serving staff are friendly and the food is fantastic.

First time I had the Eggs Royale which may be the best Benedict I have ever had- the salmon was perfect texture and flavor, and the hollandaise matched well with the perfectly poached egg. I had a milk chocolate tart for dessert and took a croissant to go, delicious! 

This time I had a breakfast croissant with hashbrowns- incredible! I also had the lavender-vanilla green iced tea which is super tasty. Taking a salted caramel eclair to go so I can't comment on its flavor yet but I doubt I will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Finally a French restaurant full of charm and absolutely fresh quality food. I tried the scallops in the garlic sauce and it was everything I would have hoped for. I did regret not getting the mussels with fries, but that simply means I will have to go back very soon. Having a chance to speak French with the chef made the experience even more special. It's so rare to enjoy exquisite food and discuss every detail with the actual chef. I didn't make it to dessert and that was a great shame. These deserts looked sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"Wish I could add another star!  What a jewel in the desert!  I could go on with superlatives, but it would be redundant after all the other great reviews. Just don't miss going there!"}
{"text":"Website says you guys are open till 8pm on Wednesdays, and the board on the restaurant also says that, but I came today at 7:15pm and the door was locked, and the lady inside indicated that you were shut. 

Either get your timing on the website or yelp or google right, or keep your restaurant open till the time you say its open."}
{"text":"Macaroons were good, better than I could make at home. I will probably get them again I just wish there was more of a variety and that I could mix and match on my own. It's a smaller patisserie than the one I like in Evanston, IL. For Arizona to even have a patisserie I was greatly relieved, but I do miss my pistachio macaroons. 

Recommend, but wouldn't pop in daily for macaroons (have to buy packs of 6 at a time). That's too many for my wallet and my belt."}
{"text":"Love this new gem.  The service was warm and friendly, and the food was magnificent.  We had mussels, scallops, beef and salad.  All was amazing...   and the desserts are unreal!

We loved it for dinner and will be back for lunch too!"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch. When you walk in you are ignored. The servers are unemotional and don't acknowledge that you are even there. Needs new management."}
{"text":"I've been in this place twice. It's a excellent place to dine because the food is delicious and the prices are small ;) Also, the customer service is really good and everybody's nice :-)"}
{"text":"Ok....so I wanted to give this place another shot and was disappointed again.  I ordered the ham and cheese crepe and it was just not good. The ham was weird and the crepe was buckwheat. They have you order and pay and tip before you get your food and then the server never comes to check on you. So, I just left you 20% for what? Tap water and a bad meal. I told the server when she came outside to deliver someone's food and she was very nice and went to get me the quiche instead. The quiche was very good and the salad dressing is amazing. Its just a spring mix and tomatoes though. The boy got macaroons but they were super tasteless. We also tried the chefs special which was a lime tart. No doubt the pastry chef makes beautiful desserts but it tasted like its been in the fridge for a week. The Irish cream was good, not great. Overall, I was hoping to change my review but I just cant."}
{"text":"I love quaint little cafés like this one. The ladies at the register were extremely friendly and the chef even came out and greeted all the tables making sure everything was as it should. The food is to never disappoint and the pastries are top notch. Today I got the open faced club sandwich and it was delicious and perfectly paired with a side salad. Can't wait to come back to enjoy more of this little place!"}
{"text":"To be fair I really do love this place and it deserves 3.5 stars. BUT, the service isn't the best and the food isn't consistent. If you go for a croissant call first because they have ran out 3 different times and the breakfast sandwich seems different every time I get it. Either way the food is great and the owners are the definition of lovely. 

The macaroons can't be beat! And I would highly recommend the crab burger! YUM!"}
{"text":"I just went here for lunch with Chris C. (who reviewed it earlier), and had the same Le Parisien burger he mentioned in his review. Every bit of it was mouthwateringly fantastic, and the even the fries were perfect. It's a good thing I have solid willpower or I would have come out of there with some serious pastries as well, because they looked delicious.

It's obvious these guys put a *lot* of work and passion into their food, and the prices are surprisingly low. Don't let their understated location fool you -- there's some world-class eating happening here."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite brunch spot in the valley. I would recommend every single thing in the menu. The quiche is to die for! It is a small intimate dining room with a small cozy patio."}
{"text":"Great lil' place with a charming vibe - you will meet the chef at least twice during the night. Pastries are impeccable and dinner courses are delicious without being excessively priced. My wife and I had the linguine and the beef bourguignon - beef was perfectly cooked. 

Highly recommended, for dinner or for a quick coffee and pastry."}
{"text":"Nice staff and great food!

I had the French onion soup... so tasty and served with a salad."}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around.  Food was delicious, atmosphere adorable, and the waitress very friendly."}
{"text":"You know you are at the right place for breakfast when there was a line waiting outside before it was opened. What a lovely place to have breakfast at. We were here right when it opened at 9a.m. The food was delicious and their dessert is simply amazing. Their Crossiant was to die for. It was soft, fluffy and buttery. We ordered a egg benedict with ham and another one with salmon. Both of them were equally delicious. The presentation for the dessert was great, but a bit too sweet for my taste. Cream puff was perfect though. Overall, I enjoy every minute of it. 

I highly recommend people who haven't been here to give it a try. I'll definitely come back here again."}
