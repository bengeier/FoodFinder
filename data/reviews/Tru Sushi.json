{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the sushi was amazing.  Super fresh and tasty !  Service was on par and the DJ Gable played appropriate music and volume to keep the crowd entertained.  The best sushi spot hands down in Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"We called in last minute with a 20+ person wedding party and they hooked us up with the entire patio and a few bottles of champagne on the house! Hospitality and service was impeccable, food was great as well."}
{"text":"A must visit. Calamari is incredible. ..spicy, yet not over pow e ing, full flavors come through. The \" My Idea\" roll is exquisite,  great flavor and creative presentation."}
{"text":"Walked up here from our hotel - as it turns out, they're just opening, but it seemed like they have a lot of kinks worked out.  We started sitting outside, but the fan over the area was loud so we moved inside on the suggestion of Kyle, bartender extraordinaire.   We ordered nigiri and a pair of rolls, started with Kyle ' s recommendation of calamari.  Things I loved:  calamari - different, non-greasy, fab sauces.  The nigiri was splendid with a hint of citrus and obvious freshness.  Rolls had a uniqueness.  Honestly, the FMIF roll sauce was a miss - thyme and citrus that sounded great but just didn't work.  The roll itself was great.  The Rock Star roll was a bright contrast of flavors.  Music:  everything about Scottsdale is a slight techno pop flair, but it wasn't obnoxious even for this older couple.  Had a wonderful dinner here."}
{"text":"The sushi was great, the people were nice, I really enjoyed it.   It makes a perfect place if you want an easy pregame spot (with good parking) to meet your friends at before you go clubbing, and if you decide to have a chiller night, you can make that happen as well.   Will be back soon."}
