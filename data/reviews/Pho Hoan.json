{"text":"My parents introduced me to this place, at first I thought it was alright.  I had previously only ordered their rice dishes.  They don't have com tam which is broken rice and instead use regular long grain rice.  Doesn't really impact the flavor that much but because it's harder and harder to find now a days, it's bonus if they have it.

This place isn't in the nicest part of town and it's your typical Vietnamese restaurant, minus the neon lights lol.

The pho sate though, OMG I absolutely love.  It's thick, super spicy, and a bold peanut flavor to it.  I thoroughly enjoy this dish although it makes me look like I've been doing an ugly cry for an hour because of the hotness.  

Must try it!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my meal at all. I didn't see satay chicken pho on the menu but I saw satay beef so I asked if they had it. They said they did. When they brought over the pho they brought a small dish with \"spicy\" and told me to add it myself. The spicy sauce was not a sate sauce. I ended up adding too much and not being able to eat my meal. Will not go back. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to pho dau bo."}
{"text":"Had hair in my food. Waitress made an excuse instead of an apology. \"Sometimes there's accident\" she said.

Food was good though so that's why there's still stars. And waitress is going to give me a 'deal'.... Lol... For bad food. Lol.

Terrible service mean waitress. I got the chicken with deep fried eggs broken rice.

Should've been really good food. Except for the hair. And the waitress."}
{"text":"This is my favorite vietnamese restaurant in town! I've been to different places, but this place is always my to go to. Worth driving for. The food is the best! Lots of portions at a very reasonable price. Must try!"}
{"text":"I'm super pumped I found this restaurant. I'm viet and I'm always on the search for an authentic viet restaurant. They even put congealed pig blood in their Bum Bo Hue. Talk about authentic! 

This place will not disappoint. Their sign doesn't stick out and the interior could be fresher, but you won't regret eating here.

I highly recommend their Banh Cuon. They do it right. And of course cap off your meal with Cafe Sua Da (ice coffee)."}
{"text":"Great place for pho. 
 It is open until 10PM even on Sunday when most other places are closed."}
{"text":"The decor is your typical Vietnamese flare but I'm not here to judge aesthetics; however, I love it cause it's simple and tells me that the focus is on the food...and this place serves it up well!

Pho (beef)...5 stars.  Definitely the best pho in town!  All the pho shops here on 17th Ave SE offer a very flavorful broth, but this place is by far the best...and that says a lot considering the competition. The broth is not only flavorful but they give you plenty of meat, as well...even so, I always ask for double the meat! ;)

Vermicelli...5 stars.  Regardless of your choice of protein, the dish looks and tastes exactly how it's supposed to be.  The sauce and ingredients are all perfect.

Egg roll/Spring roll...5 stars.  Doesn't get any better when egg rolls are filled with actual ground pork...makes a world of a difference!"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB.

That sentence wasn't a typo. Because when you have a meal at this place you will definitely drop your \"the\"s because your belly is full of Vietnamese awesomeness.

Once in a while I drop in here when I feel like I earn a free-pass meal after hours of training at Gracie Barra, which is just a block down the street *Best-Bjj-club-in-the-city-shameless-plug* . And the first time I discovered this restaurant was when my training buddies BJ and Walton invited me, a doe-eyed white-belt for post-training pho and bun. I sat there NOMING away on my beef ball pho while they traded secrets that would lead to me smashing people on the mats in the future...

but I digress (like always)

Since then I've tried several of their soups. Their hot and sour seafood pho is 2 legit...legitimately BOMB 2 quit. That didn't make sense but I highly suggest this soup because with the hundreds of Vietnamese restaurants in this city, the great ones tend to make their unique dishes shine. It's hearty, succulent, and has a refreshing aftertaste, while making you breathe through your mouth even after you've driven off the parking lot.

Also the ration of Vietnamese diners here is at a high volume. This isn't racist but it is a good indication but I know a Filipino restaurant is legit when I see Pinoys nomming away on something they could make at home.

{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Super Excellent Food. Some of the fastest service found anywhere. Pleasant. Friendly. Decor - part urban brick, part concrete floor, part wicker - interesting and it works. The music is a tad eclectic with 50s tunes, elevator music and even a Christmas tune - true story. These guys know how to cook and serve. This is a B-back.:)"}
{"text":"This has been our go to for good Vietnamese soups. I usually order the Hot and Sour seafood pho, the beef and carrot with egg noodle soup and the Sate Beef. Consistently good, open till 10pm everyday. I cant ask for more."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for rare beef soup for many years. Although there have been mistakes here and there generally due to language barriers between myself and the servers they are always happy to correct them. I love the food and continue to come here regularly. After attempting to try alternative Vietnamese restaurants I was unable to find one that compares!"}
{"text":"The chick below(amanda) just order the wrong item that's why it wasn't good. 

I'm Vietnamese and this place is good. The regular soup is good, pho dac biet (special), pho tai, etc. Sate which she order, isn't as great. That's why there's pho dau Bo across the street for that.

Also the Bo kho(beef stew) is good with pho noodles/egg noodles / baguette. Make sure you get extra lemon and a small bowl. Squeeze all the lemon into the bowl and add a lot of black pepper. Dip the beef in that awesome sauce you just made yourself!"}
{"text":"What to do for lunch...what to do for lunch...what to do for lunch?!?!?!  Could drive you crazy if you are kinda foodie trapped in industrial lane in the outskirts of Calgary.  The place is littered with fastfood and gastronomic suicide places.
I just wanted a simple lunch and can I get one on Barlow and Peigan?  Nope!  Culture would be an OPA! Next to a lube station.
Didn't want anything fancy...just something that said, Cowboys not welcomed or no cattle wrestling zone...I'm overtly exaggerating but it would be nice!  :))
Decided on Pho.  Fast, economical, and no nonsense food with some flavours and good old MSG!
How the heck was I supposed to know that the nearest one on the handy dandy app would have led me 20mins away from work.  Oh well, the sacrifices one makes so we don't die from food boredom.
Pho Hoan is nothing special from the outside and guess what!?!  Nothing special on the inside either.  I was told by a Chinese server in a GTA restaurant...you eat food...not decor.  With that in mind, rare beef pho and some spring rolls please!
The pho portion is adequate to make a meal and not leave you wanting - that was the small bowl too.  The spring roll is the same as many places that I have had in Toronto.
All in all, the place was OK for Pho.  The restaurant was quiet with the two servers keeping to themselves.  Food came out at a good pace and the experience was pleasant.  Though the locals really love this place, I am basically going by what I know from my travels across Canada.  This place is A-OK and could stretch to a 3.5 star.
Cheers!"}
