{"text":"Definitely one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have in your entire lifetime.

The house special is always the best option, but always keep your eye out for their weekend or daily specials on their Instagram. If you don't have Instagram, then you're either too hipster, too stubborn, or you don't own a cell phone. 

The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo (a weekend special) is hands down one of the top 5 best sandwiches I've ever had. These guys know what's up.

Best for lunch."}
{"text":"In the ever expanding foodscape on Dundas West, I'm happy to report the weeks-old Porchetta & Co. is a welcome addition.

 Adhering to the philosophy that less is more, similar to local legend California Sandwiches with their veal 'wiches, Nick auf der Mauer aims to do one thing, porchetta, and do it well. Very well.
 
I met up for a New Year's Eve lunch with friends to sample the wares at this tiny spot that's been getting all kinds of great buzz. I won't speak for the other ladies, but I for one can assure you, you can believe the hype.

These porcine bundles of joy are sandwiched between soft and crusty sourdough buns from Portuguese bakery, Caldense. At $5.95 for the basic sandwich, it's a healthy size for most. Seriously guys, the pork. It is juicy, packed with flavour, most notably a lovely garlic note from the marinade, and is studded with the most delightfully crispy bits of skin I've encountered in a while. I ordered the sandwich with mushrooms, but would love to try it with the mild bitterness of rapini next time.

While the star at Porchetta & Co. is obviously the sandwich, you can also partake in a side of soup or roasted potatoes. If you're feeling extra hungry, swear to god, have the potatoes. The only time I've ever encountered a mouthful like them, is what is referred to by select members of my family and friends as \"the potatoes\". One year, I roasted my bird Ã  la Martha Stewart, basted in wine and butter, and placed halved new potatoes under the roasting rack to absorb and cook in the buttery, winey drippings. P&C's potatoes come close to these.

Simply seasoned in salt, pepper and olive oil, the spuds are roasted until golden and simultaneously crispy and fluffy. Potato perfection. I said \"Why not?\" to the offer of truffle sauce to go with them, and would recommend this dressing in a heartbeat. All the flavours in each dish danced together like Bolshoi on my tongue, each performing their role perfectly to make my mouth happy.

Porchetta & Co. are located at 825 Dundas St. W, and are open Tues.-Sat. 11:00am-9:00pm; Sun. 11:00am-4:00pm; closed Mondays. Now, go!

{"text":"This place is great!  My fave toppings : parmesan, truffle oil and grainy mustard."}
{"text":"The porchetta sandwich here is so delicious and juicy. The buns seem fresh and are crispy. The service is good, the place is clean. The price is pretty good for the size and amount of meat you get."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick sandiwch of pork goodness. If you are in the area and are thinking of hitting Subway, do yourself a favour and shell out the extra 3 bucks and get a sandwich from here. Featured on Anthony Bourdain's Layover episode in Toronto. Go get your fatty pork goodness!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Food is better than I was expecting it to be. We arrived around 6:45pm on a Tuesday night so the restaurant wasn't too busy (about half full). I would certainly come back! I was almost tempted to order another dish though I was so full just because the food was so tasty and made me crave trying the whole menu! 

Porchetta plate with poutine upgrade: It didn't look like much meat was provided at first sight but once I dug in I was proven wrong. All that superbly tender and moist meat was hidden under the mound of fries, cheese, gravy and cracklings. The poutine was the right balance of flavours. It was not too salty (like most other place make it) and the fries-cheese-gravy proportions was perfect. There was enough to have a bit of everything with each bite. And the crunchy cracklings (fried pork skin) is drool worthy! It's so very different from the Chinese roast pork skins. Nommm. 

Service: The cashier lady was so nice! She was always smiling and encountering in small talk. It was a very pleasant experience. Plus, the food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. 

Atmosphere: The restaurant is a bit small, it can hold approx. 20 people max. There are high tables that hold 2-4 people and bar seats against the walls. The music is not too loud and it looks like a nice place to chill. You won't feel rushed to leave. 

I will definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"This place knows what it does best and only serves one item, porchetta sandwiches!!! 
The crackling is amazing and the meat is delicious.  Get one for lunch and two for dinner, as i feel the sandwiches are a bit light on the meat and you want to be full."}
{"text":"This little spot (and I do mean little, don't expect to sit for long) is great for a quick sandwich on the go. The House Special is the way to go with delicious pork, crackling, mustard, mayo, truffle oil and parmesan. Not into pork? The fried chicken sandwich looks amazing. The service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"This review is on their weekly chicken special, I don't eat pork and so yes, I do look forward to Thursday checking my instagram so I can see what their feature sandwich is. 
Porchetta never fails to deliver a delicious fried chicken sandwich, the love that goes into making it is evident. The staff are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm speaking to the Dundas location as my experience at the King was different (unfortunately) 
We come for the wicked fried chicken sandwich on the weekend since we don't eat pork and yeah, these guys freakin kill it! They're very unique with the different flavours they do. 
My favourite is obviously the 'Big Mac' and their Asian flavoured one, basically man, you can't go wrong. 
The service is always on point as well!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in the door i was taken over by such a wonderful pork smell... I can only hope its still lingering on my coat (for the enjoyment of others) I had never had a Porchetta before, so I opted for the plate, instead of the sandwich. I wanted to make sure i tasted this thing the way it was made! The porchetta was incredible. Perfectly seasoned, and flavourful. I didn't use any of the mustard they gave me. Some of the pieces were a little fatty - which i LOVE... But the lady wasn't so into. The only complaint I can possibly come up with is that i was left wanting more. Maybe they should offer a small/large plate option?"}
{"text":"Porchetta and Co. is one of those restaurants that truly lives up to all the buzz and hype. 

I eat here at least twice a month. Their sandwiches are absolutely delicious - the pork is a great mix of tender and crunchy and the truffle sauce takes the sandwiches up one more level. 

Everything is fresh and delicious - the savoury meat, the fluffy buns and the soup (the soup is also delicious!). 

Sometimes when I'm at home alone I think about Porchetta and I have to limit my visits since I'm worried that visiting too frequently will make me immune to Porchetta's deliciousness (this is not even close to happening - every time I eat there I think that the sandwich is better than the last). 

Couldn't ask for anything else in a sandwich. I'm so glad you're in the neighbourhood Porchetta. You make my life better."}
{"text":"Okay, the only reason why I knew about Porchetta is because of Anthony Bourdain.  Don't we all wish we could have his job!  Anyhow, I got the Special Sandwich and it was delicious.  Right combination of mustard and hot sauce.  The pork and crackling was amazing.   We also order the coleslaw and it was a perfect side to cut through the savory pork sandiwch.

I wish there was more seating because it's a small little joint.  I was standing and eating while my wife was able to get a seat.  The place was getting busy with a lineup on friday night.  I'm going to go back again and hopefully they're still serving their fried chicken sandwich special."}
{"text":"I love the pork sandwiches here.  They are delicious!  Get their special, which includes truffle oil and a grainy mustard.  Totally worth the trip to eat them here.  The only thing is, there really isn't any seating.  They have about 3 stools, so if you want to sit and dine, this isn't your place.  If you want great tasting food, you need to try this.  A sandwich will cost you approx $6-10."}
{"text":"Porchetta and Co is a small little sandwich shop (when I say small, I mean standing-room-only small) that serves exactly what you think it does: porchetta. And that's pronounced \"porketta\". The recipe for this traditional Italian pork roast at Porchetta and Co starts off with a 24 hour marinated pork shoulder. It's wrap it in prosciutto, then again wrap in cured pork belly, and roasted until crispy on the outside. This masterpiece is finally carved to be placed on sour dough buns. Sound amazing? Well it kind of is.

Porchetta Grilled Cheese ($6.45) - with crackling,, caramelized onion jam : It was actually ridiculous how good this Porchetta Grilled Cheese was. We cut it up into quarters for sharing purposes, but each small little square was jam packed with cheese. The outside is grilled so crunchy that I had to do a double take to ensure it wasn't actually fried. And while I usually don't order grilled cheese since it's something I can so easily make at home, this one was able to blow me away with the onion jam gave. It gave it an interest flavour and extra oomph. Very very good.

Porchetta Sandwich ($6.45)  with Truffle Sauce ($0.75): Taking my first bite into the Porchetta Sandwich made me realize how much the meat resembled Chinese roasted pork. The skin isn't as crispy, but the meat is definitely more tender and succulent. The truffle sauce is an add on, and to be honest I couldn't specifically isolate the flavour of it, and don't know if it really added all that much to the sandwich. I think next time I'll try it with some other things they have on the menu, like mushrooms (+$0.75), rapnini (+$0.75) or mozzarella cheese (+$0.95).

On Saturdays, they have a soft shell crab special that is out of this world. MUST TRY."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out given all the hype. At the end of the day the sandwich here is excellent and great value for money. 
It's a pity they have such little seating space but having said that it's not a place you would want to hang out too long as you and your clothes will stink of pork afterwards."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the pictures you see on Instagram. So I was looking through @tastetoronto & found this place & decided to check out the joint. I ordered an og fried chicken  sandwich and a fried chicken parmesan sandwich & a side of a rice ball. Service was whatever no smiles. I noticed they didn't fry the chicken fresh, it was already fried & thrown back into the oven to \"warm\" it up. The rice ball tasted like it was cooked in pork fat, which isn't fair if they did and failed to inform me the consumer. And 2 sandwiches and rice ball cost about $26. Really? The fried chicken batter was hard. It's unfortunate, I would of waited for a fresh piece of fried chicken. I won't be coming back. Thanks, but no thanks. There are better friend chicken sandwich joints in the city."}
{"text":"I ordered \"The Plate\" (5 oz. of porchetta + crackling + 1 side) with rapini as my side and got it to go.  It was excellent!  The rapini was cooked to order so it took a little while longer than ordering just a sandwich as most people were doing.  It also came with little containers of mustard and hot sauce.  The mustard was a really nice whole grain, if you're into that sort of thing.  The pork was moist and delicious and the crackling was crispy.

This location also sells a fried chicken sandwich which looks delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the house special porchetta sandwich. Built to order right in front of my eyes. It looked delicious as they were putting it together, it was even more delicious on consumption. The crackling skin were nice bite sized crunchy pieces in the sandwich. Juicy tender pork with hot sauce and mustard... 
It's a good thing I don't live nearby, I'd be broke and fat from eating it all the time. 
You can also buy the meat by the pound for late night cravings."}
{"text":"Everybody is losing their minds over Porchetta & Co, a tiny sandwich shop on Dundas West. With a limited menu (guess what they serve?) done well, it's no surprise.

Though Porchetta & Co. isn't anywhere close to my roaming range for lunch, I decided to make the trek out and see what all the fuss was about. The buzz had been strong since they opened and the waves of main-stream media coverage had just begun. At the time of my first visit, eye magazine had just pushed their review out the door, Globe & Mail was slated for the Saturday, and NOW Magazine was on deck. Despite all this, I pretty much went in with no expectations. It helped that I hadn't had a proper porchetta sandwich before.

Given my greenness, I decided that the basics were in order and opted for their plain porchetta sandwich. Nice bits of crackling, charred and caramelized fatty bits, a little olive oil on the bun, and all that lovely porky goodness. It's an excellent sandwich, but I didn't think it was worth the insanity. Except I kept thinking about it. That taste. The textures. And when I could make my next visit?

Two days later, I found myself at their door again. I didn't think I'd be back so soon, but the memory of my first sandwich lingered and thoughts of my next sandwich compelled me. This time, I took the recommendation of rapini and truffle sauce. To be honest, I thought the bite of the rapini distracted from the delicious nuances of porchetta and that the truffle sauce got lost in it all. Not bad, but the plain sandwich was better to me. Luckily, you can get the rapini on the side, which is perfect, I think.

And speaking of sides, I tried the potatoes. While okay, I don't really need to supplement my sandwich with anything, so these spuds are off my re-order list.

Also on offer is a soup of the day. Their creamy cabbage soup with smoked bacon was quite nice, not too salty, and had a liberal dose of grainy mustard. Very chowder-like and fortifying against the cold. With the sandwich, a small soup was a bit much for lunch. I managed not to fall into a food coma when I got back to work.

Despite the distance travelled, I didn't have to wait long to get my food - maybe 5 minutes at off-peak hours - and I managed to snag one of the few stools in the small space both times as well. But I can imagine that during the lunch-hour rush, you'd be out of luck. While I still maintain that this is a bit too far out of my lunchtime grazing area, it doesn't really matter. Count me in as one who's lost her mind too. Happily.

{"text":"The sandwich with truffle sauce and mustard is mouth watering. Was introduced to this place by a friend who said it was single handedly the best sandwich he a ever had. Surprisingly, the sandwich lives up to the hype. It's a craving I'll always have every time I'm in the neighbourhood. Have it with the bolynn soda. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Decided to take a last minute trip to Toronto. Did a little research before of where to eat (aka watching The Layover with Anthony Bourdain). I decided I had to try this spot. I got the breakfast sandwich with extra meat and it was delicious. The egg was a a perfect addition to the saltiness of the sandwich and the bread was the perfect combination of soft, but sturdy enough to hold the sandwich together. The mustard was also really great!"}
{"text":"The house sandwich is amazing!!! Don't have the rapini, not sure why they have it on the menu, it sounds good. But apparently if it's not done right, it end up very bitter. And that's how it tasted, so bitter its unpalatable."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews and hearing so much hype about this place, I told myself \" Me, need to go!\" I'm a meat lover so I was pretty looking forward to getting my taste buds rejoicing after.

I ordered the sandwich and I was so excited because I'm a meat lover. After the first bite I know right away that the meat is DRY. Mind you it is well-spiced but it's not enough to make up for the lack of moisture. Nothing special about this place, I'm not going back ."}
{"text":"I came by on Mother's day since I assumed most brunch spots would be packed. After seeing the sign outside their restaurant for their Porchetta breakfast Sammy (porchetta, baked egg, crackling and smoked gouda), I was sold! The bread it was served on was the same bread they use for their regular sandwiches. The combination of the meat with the egg and smoked gouda was amazing... What I really liked about Porchetta was that they ensure each sandwich has a bit of crackling on it. Despite how bad it is for you, I could eat crackling like chips... yum!

My boyfriend got the regular porchetta sandwich and added mushrooms and rapini. He didn't want to add any of the extra sauces (truffle/tomato) because he really wanted to taste the meat. I found that the sandwich didn't really need any condiments, but I'm not sure this would be the case if we hadn't added the extra toppings. Next time I want to try the truffle sauce! We both really enjoyed this sandwich as well.. the meat was very moist and flavourful. 

Things to keep in mind:
- the place is really tiny (about 5-6 stools max), so it's really catered to take-out
- cash only (we almost didn't have enough cash for our meal!)
- toppings cost extra ($0.25 to $0.95 each)"}
{"text":"This place is totally worth it. The sandwiches are amazing!!!

My friends from Victoria come here twice a year with their band (Dayglo Abortions) I took them there once and now they head straight there!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, pork and chicken. One gripe, great tasting coleslaw, but for the price WAY too small...fix that and I would order coleslaw every time!"}
{"text":"Had their Sandwich with mushrooms and really, really enjoyed it. 

Love the Porchetta, it is the bomb. I get it once in a while and die every time.

The only reason I give four stars is because it's cash only. I usually carry debit."}
{"text":"Porchetta & Co at Dundas destroys this Porchetta & Co. You guys get the balance all wrong and make the sandwich too fatty. Go watch how they do it please. There's a serious disconnect here and I hate this location."}
{"text":"Sandwich is good, but needs more meat! Plus, charging extra for the sauce and a few sprinkle of cheese is a rip off! Sandwich comes out to $9! What kind of place charges extra for sauce? Especially when the sandwich would be bland and dry without it, so you need the sauce. Also, that few shavings of parmesan cheese is not worth an extra dollar. If they are going to charge a premium for this, at least offer payment by debit, and a smile by the cashier would be nice."}
{"text":"It's been a week since I tasted the porchetta chowder and I'm still thinking about it.  Utterly delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love that this lunch spot is right in my hood.  This Dundas west spot is a great place to people watch while crunching down on your crackle.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Tried the jerk fried chicken and it was amazing two thumbs up. Weird music. Good vibe tho. Nice lil spot"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not for vegetarians or vegans. Porchetta & Co serves up a fantastic, pork sandwich - more like heart attack on a plate, but what a lovely way to go. 

With  just the right amount of salty and chewy meat in a soft, fresh bun, it was love at first bite for me. I tried their standard toppings on the pork, grainy mustard and hot sauce. Next time I might add the truffle oil, which I hear is a fan favourite. The service was friendly and I appreciated their spic and span kitchen. Just lovely."}
{"text":"This is sandwich done right.  The barbecued pork is tender and delicious on its own as well but I recommend ordering it as a sandwich.  They've found the perfect combination of ingredients to compliment it.  I happen to think bread makes or breaks the sandwich, and they have the perfect bread to go along with the pork.  It's crispy on the outside and light and soft inside.  The combination of muster, chili sauce, paper thin slivers of dry cheese (I'm not a cheese expert) works wonderfully with the bread and porchetta.  I recommend it with beer and fries.  Love it."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the king street location because Dundas is literally 250m from our house. This place was so great when it first opened, but since the new location has opened, I guess all the focus is on King. Food is still pretty good, but the service is so breathtakingly horrible. A couple of time it gave the cashier the benefit of the doubt - it's hot, it's busy, we all have bad days - but yikes. Horrible service. I guess one doesn't really go for the service... but I can do without the flippant grouchy attitude. Also, I got home and realize I was given a chicken parm sandwich and not the chicken plate. Not sure how plate and sandwich can be confused. Too lazy to go back, so I just ate it. My fault for not checking before leaving. Maybe the music is too loud for the staff to hear actual orders... anyway, I am sure I will forget this experience and go back to be disappointed once again. Meh..."}
{"text":"It's the crackling that sells me on the porchetta sandwich.  I just love the play of textures in this thing: soft bun, grainy mustard, tender pork, and of course, piles of crackling (hardly a surprise that it shares the same first syllable as crack cocaine).

Mmm.  I'm still thinking about that sandwich.  It's an indulgence, but well worth it."}
{"text":"One of the most memorable and delicious sandwiches ever.  I had the special with truffle sauce, grainy mustard, hot sauce and freshly grated Parmesan.  Moist and flavorful pork, enhanced by condiments and textural cracklings.  Honestly, this is where a luncheon sandwich at less than $10 can easily best a finely honed dinner at a top restaurant with a team of well versed food professionals in the kitchen.  Worth a detour!"}
{"text":"One mighty excellent sandwich. 

Porchetta & Co. is located on Dundas West, just west of Bathurst on the south side. It's pretty much take-out only, there is a counter in the window with four stools and a long gymnasium-style bench outside (for spring/summer/fall visits).

Went Saturday morning for an early lunch. Happened to get there just before a mini rush. Lucky.

Ordered the Breakfast Sammy which consists of their classic porchetta sandwich (porchetta, crackling, hot sauce on a super fresh, crusty on the outside, soft & fluffy on the inside Portuguese bun) with the addition of a fried over easy egg & smoked gouda. Opted to add truffle sauce as well. 

The sandwich was to die for, salty, fatty porchetta mixed with super crispy delicious crackling, smooth creamy eggy and cheesy goodness. I could have eaten two. 

It's great to see small restaurants like Porchetta & Co. can exist in Toronto. They only do one thing, but do it perfectly. 

A new favourite spot in the city.

NOTE: Porchetta & Co. is cash only! Be sure to hit a bank machine prior to your visit. For those who forget, there is an ATM machine in the 7 Eleven down the street."}
{"text":"Salt sandwich with dry fried chicken bits inside and forgettable bread - others call it the fried chicken sandwich.
Porchetta sandwich was decent but it could be because the fried chicken was so bad...

Fries and mustard were good.  Friendly staff.

Final Verdict: Not again"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews here and elsewhere Porchetta and Co was a definite must on my trip. It's a little bit outside the CBD but a pretty easy walk and well worth it. I went in the early afternoon and there was no queue but there was also no seating available. I got the sandwich with mushrooms, parmesan and rapini - it was fantastic with the pork juicy and the crackling providing important texture as well as being delicious. Importantly the bun from the local Cadanese Bakery was perfect, with just the right amount of resistance to it.

I enjoyed it so much that I went back a couple of days later and tried the sandwich with mozzarella and truffle sauce. Surprisingly, since I love truffle, I didn't quite enjoy this as much - it didn't have the same flavour balance to it but the pork, bun and crackling were still great."}
{"text":"You HAVE to follow Porchetta on Instagram. Wait until they have the fried chicken, and get there as quick as you can. Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great place. Quick service. The highlight is the porchetta of course. I recommend getting the base offering of the porchetta sandwich so you can experience the full flavour of the bread and meat without anything else getting in the way."}
{"text":"Their main feature is the sandwich and it's more of a texture dish than a flavour one.  

The Porchetta House Special comes with porchetta, truffle sauce, mustard, parmesan cheese, hot sauce, and crackling all between a sourdough bun .  The pork is moist, the parmesan melts above, and the crackling adds the right crunch to the tender meat. 

It lacked flavour and there was too much bun relative to the meat.  I would return if I was in the neighbourhood but I wouldn't make a special trip for this joint."}
{"text":"So we were at Hashtag gallery for an opening when we suddenly felt hungry.  Could it be that it was already 8pm?! So we meandered down the street to Porchetta & Co. This place is sort of off the beaten path (i never venture to dundas st. w) but that night, it was packed. So we go in to escape the chilly weather.  On the menu, there were not too many options.  So I opted for the special - Pork sandwich with truffle oil and parmesan cheese for $10.95.  What else are you supposed to order at a place called Porchetta?!

I was really hungry by then so anything that crossed my palette would have subsided my hunger pangs, however this sandwich had alot to offer. Crispy, flavorful, and succulent.  There was a staff at the back chopping a large piece of crispy pork. The scene reminded me of roast pork from Chinatown, however at triple the price per pound. This was definitely not your run of the mill, average crispy pork, this was GOURMET pork...

So some people got up to leave as we received our order. We managed to sit cozily on industrial grade (or vintage) stools. Im not sure if it was hunger or flavor that made me wolf down my sandwich, but overall, it was very tasty and succulent - a melt in your mouth type of feeling. Not sure if it was psychological - hmm..truffle oil...or the crispiness...or simply pure raw hunger that made it taste so good, but I felt fully satiated and happy. My belly was full, my taste buds were content, and I got to taste flavors that were never previously combined before.

I would give this place a high rating for originality.  They do one thing and seem to do it well.  Also, the pork and buns were fresh and warm when served.  I would definitely go back or recommend atleast trying this place once. Crunchy and moist are the key words."}
{"text":"just good and fatty killer sandwich
try the truffle sauce and mushroom combo"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. 

I'm glad I asked for extra meet because without it, the sandwich would have had very little meat inside it. Of what was there was very tasty although the hot sauce is very acidic and as there was so much it actually masked a lot of the pork flavour.

I short, not enough meat, not particularly mind blowing, but would go again due to its convenient location."}
{"text":"I came in here with high expectations of Porchetta NYC but left a little disappointed. The porchetta smells good, looks good, and tastes good, but it wasn't blow your mind great. Like other reviewers stated, it reminded me of Chinese roasted pork, which you can get a full take-out box of for the same price. What I mean by this comparison is that it didn't have much flavour. Porchetta usually should have hints of herbs or smoky/salty proscuitto... but the Porchetta here just tasted like unseasoned roasted pork.

What really irked me though was how the person at the front weighs the meat per sandwich prior to making your sandwich like it was made of sturgeon caviar, white truffles, and saffron. If it's \"overweight\", he/she will meticulously pick out that sliver of meat. That to me just screamed cheap.

I did however, like how they ensured that every sandwich had a bit of crackling with it. If they didn't cheap out on the meat, I'd probably give them another star."}
{"text":"Heard a bunch of good talk about this place...I think it even made Anthony Bourdain \"Lay Over\" show - but don't quote me on it!

It's kinda hard to say no to a house special, especially when the special is a Porchetta Sandwich with Truffle Sauce, Parmesan, Mustard and a pinch of Hot Sauce!

The joint wasn't too busy so I popped in for a bun and ohhhhh man was it good!  They have about 5 seats in the place, and I only had to wait a few quick minutes before it was ready.  

The pork had just the right balance of fatty and lean pieces. The mustard complimented the parmesan, and the bun was juuust soft enough to bit into.  I paired it with a lemon flavoured san pellegrino and it ran me about $11.  A bit pricey but WELL worth the dough!"}
{"text":"Came here since I saw it featured on an episode of The Layover with Anthony Bourdain.

Very tiny place. Be prepared to eat out side on the bench or standing up.  There's three stools at the window, and two stools off to the side.

My wife and I came here twice before I decided to write this review.  The sandwiches are amazing.  VERY fresh and crunchy, and soft on the inside.  I ordered the house special, which was 4oz of porchetta and crackling skin, truffle Sauce, hot sauce, and freshly shaved Parmesan.  My wife ordered the soft-shell crab sandwich.  Both sandwiches are amazingly fresh and tasty.  The crackling skin is now an addiction.  We're always craving it, and will be going back a third time in less than a couple of week.

Check it out. You'll spot the place because you'll see a mild line-up that goes outside the restaurant.  Don't let this discourage you, cause they're quite fast.  You'll get your sandwiches within 5-7 minutes on a busy day."}
{"text":"There is a simplicity to this small shop that follows the current comfort food trend and thats OK by me. The menu is very small, the store is small, and in a way the Porchetta Sandwich is modest in its pretensions. I found the food to be a nice change from the over flavoured and over hyped offerings elsewhere and enjoyed tasting mostly pork. I would say that now having gone there quite a few times in the last few years I still have yet to have a WOW sandwich. I am moving on.


The staff have always been great."}
{"text":"It was delicious. I thought it was just the right amount of meat, crackling and fat. However i found this time around the house special sandwich could've used more parmesan or the truffle sauce. All I could taste was the mustard. I didn't even taste the truffle sauce and usually that stands out. And I found the top of the bun a little dry. Kind of leaves the top of my mouth feeling scraped. So next time I might just skip the bun and go for the plate. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Fast but delicious food. Great for a quick snack or meal. The porchetta was perfectly cooked. The seating space is definitely limited though."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in Toronto, and it's the type you dream of making at home. When someone makes it this good, though, why bother making it yourself?

For under 10 bucks, depending on the toppings (mushrooms, mustard, hot sauce, etc.) and choice of drink, you get an amazing sandwich with tender chunks of meat and crunchy crackling on a soft, warm bun.

There's seating inside for about five people.

Follow Porchetta & Co. on Twitter to find out when they're offering specials, including soft shell crab po boys and porchetta and waffles.

Cash only."}
{"text":"A simple review for a simple place. 

Menu: Porchetta, served on either a plate or in a sandwich. Toppings ($0.25-$0.75 each) include mozzarella, sauteed mushrooms, rapini, tomato sauce parm, and truffle sauce. Hot sauce and mustard are no charge. Some sides (potatoes, rapini, baked romano beans) available.

Price: about $10-$11 for a sandwich and drink

Verdict: Delicious, succulent, pork-o-rific. Go here."}
{"text":"This tiny place can put together a flavour-packed sandwich. When you go to Porchetta & Co. you don't have to spend much time looking over the menu. Get yourself a porchetta sandwich and wait for the magic to begin.

Succulent pork shoulder and crispy skin (the best part!) with truffle oil and some hearty mustard on a fresh bun. Scarf it down, say thanks, and feel the energy flow through you as you continue on your way.

Note that there are only a few seats at the window - this place is more take-out than sit-in."}
{"text":"Well they've moved to King Street but kept the great taste. I fear for my heart now that we're neighbours.

The good: same great taste but a slightly different menu. You can still get the sandwich, the plate, the house special or the new fried chicken sandwich.

The bad: The potato salad is gone as is the breakfast sandwich. The new space is larger than the old one, but it's still pretty small so you might want to grab food to go."}
{"text":"they serve pretty much only one type of food - and it is all mostly related to their pork sandwich. the pork was well cooked, but a little fatty. do not go there if you want something light . the sandwich overall was good, but there is little variety. the place is small with limited seating and no bathroom. friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place does an excellent porchetta!  Went on a freezing cold weekend afternoon with an out of town friend around 2-3, expected it to be empty, but it was packed.

Have eaten porchetta for many years at picnics and bachelor parties galore.  Best ever was in NY at the porchetta restaurant, and I'd say this was easily the second best.  The biggest pro is the taste - this is simply extremely well prepared stuff. We ordered one plate and one sandwich.  The sides of beans with the plate greatly exceeded expectations and had chucks of soft meat within.  

The weighing of the meat was a bit non-traditional, and dampens the hope of somehow beating the system and getting extra, that I always have when watching people dole out food.  However, it does allow the guy to give a good ratio of krackle-to-fat-to-meat ratio and this is important.  

The bread is very good and I have zero complaints about the taste.  My biggest gripe is that the portion size is pretty small.  This is a problem because when something tastes this good, you tend to scarf it down fast which calls even more attention to the small size.  Suggest they add more meat or knock a couple bucks off the price.  Despite loving every bite of what we had, friend and I were hungry again soon after."}
{"text":"I think the reason people got disappointed is because their expectation is extremely high, at least that's what happened to me. I've been looking forward to this sandwich for two weeks, and imagined all sorts of great things that might happen after the first bite of the sandwich, so of course, when I had my first bite for real, it was a bit different from what I expected. But after careful consideration, I have to say it was very good, one thing that I can't deny was that I finished the whole sandwich in less than 5 minutes, for me, that's a record, since it normally takes me an hour to finish one meal, so of course, it was delicious. The bread was crunchy but soft, and it was moised with pork fat, and the meat was well balanced between fatty fat fat and lean. If you want italian pork, this place offers exactly that. 

I went on Saturday afternoon, no line-up (I wasn't expecting that at all), and the service was very friendly. I'm giving it a four-star because I really don't recommend eating this on a regular basis, unless you don't care so much about getting a heart attack sooner."}
{"text":"For the last four months I have been trying to figure out what I want out of life. No matter what I end up doing one thing is for certain: I want to eat pork sandwiches, lots and lots of pork sandwiches. I rarely find a pork sandwich I don't fall for and I don't see this trend changing anytime soon. I've decided to chronicle what I believe is the beginning of a lifelong love affair with pork sandwiches.

Pork shoulder that is marinated for 24 hours, then wrapped in prosciutto, then wrapped in cured pork belly, then roasted and slow cooked. All of this is sliced and served with crackling on a sourdough bun. I got the standard but plan on adding cheese, rapini, and extra meat on my next visit. This sandwich introduced me to crackling and in many ways helped to broaden my pork sandwich worldview.  

I really enjoyed my first experience at Porchetta & Co. and promised I would check out their breakfast sandwich as soon as possible. As soon as the weekend came I decided there was no time like the present. The breakfast sandwich had the same marinated pork shoulder, prosciutto, cured pork belly, and crackling. What made it a breakfast sandwich was the addition of gouda, egg, and sauce. This incredible sandwich made my morning and kept me full late into the afternoon. I am now very excited to try their grilled cheese, soups, and most likely order a pound or two of their meat to take home.

As I mentioned earlier this is just the beginning. There was a brief period last winter where I tried going raw vegan and I feel like eating delicious sandwiches like these is the best way to make up for lost time. There are a lot of pork sandwiches in Toronto and I intend on becoming fast friends with all of them. If you know or hear of any Toronto spots serving up pork sandwiches reminiscent of these please let me know. I'd love to eat all of them.

{"text":"Praise the lard! I love this place! I've been coming here regularly since they opened as it's right around the corner from my place. California Sandwiches must be missing my ugly mug, though probably not.

There's only one thing on the menu, porchetta, and, man, is it ever good! You can order it on a sandwich or you can order it on a plate. You can order the plate with a bun so you can make your own sandwich. Do whatever you want, as long as you eat it. Don't just wear it on your head.

On the sandwiches, you can have mushrooms, rapini, tomato sauce, a mayo with truffles, parmesan and probably some other stuff. Whatever you get, don't worry, it'll be good.

The porchetta melts in your mouth as you eat it but then you get some crunchy tasty bits and it's like a whole new sandwich. The pork is so divine, I always want another immediately after.

You can also get potatoes from the Portuguese place down the street as a side, along with rapini and white beans. 

Don't forget about the soup! They tend to be made with the ingredients you see above and, of course, are delicious."}
{"text":"They don't need my review but shitdamn, this is a sandwich to make your eyes roll back in your head from pure pleasure. Being Eastern European on the maternal side, I have been raised with an appreciation for all meats that are roasted/smoked, being part fat-kid roasted fat so that it's crunchy is heaven. Their house sandwich is what I go for, extra cracklin' let's not kid around, and I make anyone who visits me in the city eat it and they always high five me afterwards. You'll high five yourself. Oh! and their sides are also incredible. I love this place"}
{"text":"Got the porchetta plate and it was really disappointing... The porchetta was dry and not flavourful and the fries were equally flavourless and dry... The counter service was also inattentive and rude. Would go back to try a sandwich if I was really craving porchetta but tbh the 14$ plate for dry pork and fries wasn't worth it. I don't know why I tipped either but if I didn't it would've been around 12$ & still not worth it."}
{"text":"You cannot pass by the place without your mouth watering. The smell of good meat fills your nostrils faster than you can order. Try an egg sandwich with all the fixings (including egg) and you won't be disappointed. It's becoming my routine stop!"}
{"text":"Once again thank you Anthony Bourdain you  have yet to disappoint!  My husband had the highly recommend porchetta plate with rapini and the poutine fries delious!  I on the other hand went with my southern insticts opted for buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which i give 10 stars! The bread was out of world. The texture was perfection with a sort of crunch I'd never heard before in a bread. The bread spoke to me."}

May not visit again unless I'm very hungry and want something very quick.
There should have been a lot more of the crispy fat in the plate"}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwich. The cracklings are my favourite part, so their effort to include this fatty goodness in each bite was appreciated."}
{"text":"What's going on Porchetta &Co.? I was 1star disappointed in my sandwiches. I have never seen an anemic ciabatta bun before but that's what you gave me today. Flavour was good but not, knock me down delicious like it was the first time I ate here.
I attest to the adage that your eyes eat first so seeing a white bun rather than a nicely browned ciabatta may have been 60% of the reason.
I'm going to assume it was just the Dundas location so I will try the King Street outlet before I turn my back on your concept."}
{"text":"I FINALLY had a chance to check out Porchetta & Co. last week, having salivated all the way there due to a grumbling stomach and high expectations. It seems the general consensus here is that this place is the holy of holies so I was pretty excited to check them out for a late lunch. 

We decided to keep things simple and each ordered the porchetta sandwich and roasted potatoes. I opted to dress things up with a little bit of mustard as I wanted to get a feel for a purer taste of the meat, but ended up having to slather on the hot sauce as there was a weird flavour that I wanted to have disappear or at least disguise. I wouldn't say it's a spice, it was more like...and this is going to sound weird but when I was really little (as in too little to know any better, I swear!), I remember finding a piece of popcorn behind a couch cushion and trying to eat it. The meat had that very flavour!! Perhaps my mistake was not to have ordered my sandwich with the truffle sauce / rapini combination as recommended by many. I love rapini but unless it's chopped up somewhat, I find it hard to eat it in a sandwich due to its stringiness. The five chunks of potato were delicious, although small, and the crackling was way too tough and lacked any crispiness. 

I was there well past the lunch rush, not that there was any shortage of customers. Portions are not very big so if you're up for a light meal or just a snack, consider Porchetta & Co. I'd like to give this place another try but this time with the truffle/rapini or their breakfast sandwich as I LOVE smoked gouda and sometimes a fried egg just makes the world a better place."}
{"text":"Porchetta pork is usually the stuff of gourmet restaurants, not $8 lunches. Porchetta & Co's location a bit too far from any hub of activity in Toronto is the only downside to this place, other than its cramped quarters. Once you've tasted it you'll find yourself pining for that briny scent."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, both for lunch sandwiches. Both times have been great. My suggestion is the plain platter with one side, which I'm partial to the rapini with huge chunks of cooked garlic in it, and get a fresh roll with it and make your own sandwich. The porchetta is great. Only downsides - a better drink selection might be nice (I end up having limonata) and the seating area is very small. It if was closer to Trinity Bellwoods, and it was summer, I'd head out there and sit on a bench there."}
{"text":"***3.5 *** 

I love Porchetta and I've had it a quite a few times, but it had been a while since the last time I'd had some, so this was definitely a treat I was looking forward to. The menu offers one thing and one thing only - Porchetta. You can have it on a sandwich or as a platter with a side for a few bucks extra, oh - and they also have a soup of the day. 

We both decided on the sandwich and added some extras (sauteed mushrooms and truffle sauce). They also have cheese,tomato sauce and rappini as possible extras to add to your sandwich. These extras will cost you anywhere from .25 cents to .75 cents. 

The sandwich was delicious - I got some cracklings,tender meat,and some fatty parts which all added up to a delicious experience. The mushrooms were good, but I couldn't really taste the truffle sauce so I don't know that it enhanced my sandwich in any way. Oh - and the bun on this sandwich is great. Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Just perfect. 

My only complaint would be that for $5.99 I was hoping My sandwich would be bigger. I was fairly satisfied with my sandwich, but could have definitely have had more. My companion is a guy and he was left hungry. I would think that most guys with a healthy appetite would need two of these to feel satisfied. 

Our 2 sandwiches with our extras came to $15.99 tax included - and remember! CASH ONLY!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of Porchetta & Co.'s ( @PorchettaAndCo )offerings: Porchetta by the pound, on a plate or as part of their famous sandwich. 

The sandwich offers 4 oz. of Porchetta and crackling (chicharron) on a bun. A handful of customizable toppings from mushrooms to rapini are available to make your sandwich your own!

The House Special consists of the suggested combination of melt in your mouth Porchetta, crispy chicharron, decadent truffle sauce, rich Parmesan, exploding mustard seeds and finishes with a light kick of hot sauce.  It's a taste of heaven and is definitely a winner!!

The fried chicken and smoked porchetta Reuben with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing is the alternative. Superb in its own right but the porchetta takes a back seat to the chicken so the House Special is still my favourite. 

Despite a simple offering, Porchetta & Co. warrants multiple return visits! ;)

{"text":"This is dangerous.

I've just discovered fresh, high-grade, hand-made porchetta inside a five-minute walking radius of home.  Bye-bye girlish figure.  Bye-bye home-cooked meals.  And hello to one of Toronto's newest and fastest-rising niche-market nooks.

That this little piggy-pusher has been under my nose for months without a visit is beyond me.  Now that I know what I've been missing, I suspect it'll rival Caplansky's for a quick, convenient meat fix (though Toronto's sultan of smoked meat will always be my main man when I'm craving kosher).

While there are a few other options on the menu, Porchetta & Co. is essentially a porchetta sandwich shop.  They make it fresh, from pork shoulder, prosciutto and - oh yes - pork belly, serving it up hot in both the \"sandwich\" and \"plate\" form factors well-known to barbeque and shawarma enthusiasts alike.  

I'm glad I got take-out.  Something told me that my first time would be special, and it was - I ate at home in solitude, moaning \"oh, god\" occasionally as I devoured every last bite and licked the wrapper clean of mushroom juice and truffle sauce drippings.  The sandwich had a little bit of everything to it, including a moderate dose of crackling adding a nice crunch once in a while, and the grainy mustard broke the fattiness with a bit of zing (thanks, Stephanie C.).  I did think the sandwich was a bit small; perhaps a \"large\" size would be a good option.

About the only thing better right now would be a crackling sandwich.  Anyone know where to get one?"}
{"text":"An awesome sandwich! I love porchetta sandwiches and this place is one of the better ones I've had. I got the house special and it did not disappoint. Good flavour in the meat and the bun is nice and crusty.
Would go back and try the different toppings. 
Also note that if you do not feel like a porchetta sandwich, they have a daily special. When I went it was fried chicken sandwich with a mac and cheese sauce I think."}
{"text":"My 3rd time eating their house special Porchetta sandwich! It's prob one of my favorite sandwiches in the GTA. Had a side Kale salad with is full of flavor and the chicks of Feta inside with their special dressing is just amazing! #porchetta&co"}
{"text":"Couldn't resist eat the entire classic sandwich... Just came from another restaurant for apps... And it was not a cheat day... Smh... But... Worth every bite."}
{"text":"This is an incredible sandwich, period.  A beautiful combination of texture (crispy pork, flaky bun, popping mustard) and all around perfect flavours."}
{"text":"I was going out to lunch when we walked by this place and caught a smell of something delicious.  Man, side tracked for lunch?  Yup, I had to do it because I love porchetta.  If you don't know what it is Google it but it's from Italy and it's delicious.  I ordered one to go with only mustard and cut in half so that I could share it.

My first bite and my first impressions were pork was tender, no crackling, bread was nice and the mustard was a great touch.  Second bite DELICIOUS crackling!  The porchetta could use some work though.  It didn't have a lot of flavour on its own and you couldn't taste any of the herbs and spices that it should normally be roasted with and gives it a more delicious flavour.  It reminded me more of Chinese roast pork more than anything.  

It's definitely a tasty sandwich but has a little work to do to take it to the next level."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying \"WHERES THE MEAT?\" How can people think this place is good? I'm Italian and I've had many Porchetta types and this has to be the worst. I was disappointed twice at the other location and the third time here at the new location. Brought the sandwich home, opened it up and found less than 3oz of Porchetta inside because most of it was full of fat (Look at the photo)...Cmon! $10 for this garbage. Never again will I come here. It's way too Overrated! So don't believe the hype. If you want a great Porchetta sandwich go around the corner to Bar Buca."}
{"text":"This is the place where you bring your friends to when they visit you from other city/country. I still remember how good it was when I took the first bite of the sandwich two years ago! I've recommended this place to so many people, and it is on my top three list among all the sandwiches I've had, yea, It is that good! It will be something I miss about Toronto if I moved to other city one day."}
{"text":"Is there a 12-step program for Porchetta addiction?

At first, I didn't understand how a sandwich could cause so much hype.
All the cool Yelp kids have been flocking here, so I had to see what the fuss was about.

And oh my...
Porchetta, I'll never be the same again.
I can't shake the memory of my first sandwich.

Tender, moist, and juicy pork shoulder, pork belly with crispy skin,
salty prosciutto on a sourdough bun.  
Topped with mushrooms, mustard, and a rich and creamy truffle sauce...

Sandwich heaven.
Crunchy...soft...chewy... what a wonderful medley of textures...flavorful... 

I'm addicted to your delicious sandwich goodness.
All I can think about is when can I have another sandwich.

Now, I just need to think of a medicinal purpose to keep eating Porchetta sandwiches...  (and find some magical way to not get fat)."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of fat - you will see me picking off my dining companion's plates the fat that they have trimmed off their steaks - so I really liked Porchetta & Co. because there was an abundance of flavourful fat in the meat.  I thoroughly enjoyed my porchetta plate with a side of baked romano beans ($10.12 after tax), but I can see how people who typically trim the fat off their steak would not enjoy it as much.

The pork itself was nicely seasoned and not overly salty.  The beans had ever so slight a kick and were nicely complemented by the crispy pieces of pork skin sprinkled on tip. In fact, those crispy pork skins were my favourite part of the meal. Is that what a pork rind that didn't come out of a package tastes like??

I think the best way to go into Porchetta & Co. is with no expectations. If you go in with high expectations after hearing so many people rave about it, then you may be disappointed that this sandwich is just a sandwich.  I think the selling point for Porchetta & Co. is that there aren't any other places like this in Toronto, so I would definitely still recommend for people to try it out.

Note there is not much seating in the place, just two bars with three stools each."}
{"text":"The best cluck sandwich I ever had, simply brilliant taste, smooth and mouth watering, service is great, you're received with a wide smile and your food is ready before you even take your coat off !!!"}
{"text":"Full oral orgasm.  I know that may sound a little rude...but I can't find a better way to describe what happens when I bite into their sandwiches.  Is it the fatty pieces of pork melting in my mouth?  Or maybe it's the crispy pork skin?  The truffle sauce?  I think it's the magical orchestra of everything they put into their sandwiches that makes this experience addictive!

My only regret is I have yet to experience Soft-Shell Saturdays!

A few months later...(updating this review)
So, I had the Soft-Shell Po Boy...and it was good but not great.  I found that the coleslaw overpowered the crab.  If I ever get it again (maybe next season), I would get the coleslaw on the side so I can fully enjoy the flavour of the crab and spicy mayo.  The bread was really soft and fresh - almost melting in my mouth.  

I had one really meaty bite in my sandwich that was without coleslaw and the crab was delicious!  If I could tweak their recipe, I wouldn't bread the crab so thickly.  I prefer the way the Japanese prepare the soft shell crab in spider rolls.  A thinner layer of breading also lets the crab flavour come through. 

Still their Porchetta sandwich is the star of the menu and I will keep this review at 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Loved this spot until recently. Quality has gone waaaay down and the only reason I go anymore is if they have a cool special
Porchetta sandos are 50-75% fat which is extremely disappointing
Chicken sandwiches have gotten smaller and smaller to the point where my last one had about an inch of space from the edge of the bun to where my chicken was (I.e there was a full bite of bread all the way around until you got to the chicken)
Mostly writing this cause I'm disappointed that they've fallen off so hard. Used to drive out of my way to come here for lunch and the past few times I've done that I've been extremely let down
Really hope they turn things around asap and not just on days that they're serving the special"}
{"text":"Great value for money. Delicious sandwiches every time."}
{"text":"Their burgers are delicious. Paired with a poutine is the best combination. Every time I come here, the food and service is excellent. 

The staff is super friendly and helpful. There's usually almost no wait time even when it's a busy night."}
{"text":"Love love this place but the service? Sad. The staff  at the cash dont know how to smile or welcome a guest. It's kills me because I love the food but they are just plain rude or their cashiers are always hungover and look miserable. 

They actually make the best sandwiches and I'm here every Friday and sometimes a few times in between but please do some customer service training. I brought some out of towners and they were shocked at how rude they were. 

Every Thursday / Friday they change their Chicken sandwich special so definitely go for that.

I've taken so many people to both locations just wish they'd be nice!"}
{"text":"I set out to find a great sandwich today and landed on Porchetta & Co. Their House Special Sandwich is the perfect combination of pork, truffle, parmigiana with their house mustard and hot sauch !

It's amazing how fast they get through so many orders theres usually never a long wait. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has good options for a day where you don't want to make dinner or lunch. The porchetta sandwich and plate are both good. Have a breakfast sandwich on the weekend if you can, best thing on the menu -it's got a fried runny egg in it.
The negative for me is that the meat for the plate can sometimes be dry and the crackling parts not that crunchy."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times as I live nearby.  The food is okay but going down hill.  Has not hanged with the times (ala healthier/ more interesting options).

Owner is against transit and hates the community."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times.  The food is average but the owner is so against the community it's remarkable.  Will not be returning and will tell others (most people who live downtown are pro-transit) to stop going."}
{"text":"I've gotten the house special a few times. Admittedly the sandwich is a bit on the smaller side but it is really, really delicious. The pork is good, and goes perfectly with their homemade mustard and the pork crisp really adds a great crunch to the sandwich.
Really yummy!"}
{"text":"I'e been here several times and I always keep coming back.  Their sandwiches never get old. I order their House Special which comes with porchetta, crackling (fried pig skin), truffle sauce, parmesan, mustard and hot sauce for $8.95. They are quick to turn the sandwich around and offer benches outside to eat on.  This sandwich does not disappoint and it is consistently well prepared. Al their ingredients complement each other very well making the next bite even better than the first. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Same menu as the original one on Dundas. The interior design however is more suited for the King West crowd.  I ordered the Porchetta plate with the additional poutine for $3.  The porchetta and crackling were delicious, but with the added poutine, the saltiness was a little overwhelming. Highly recommend the restaurant, but would not recommend adding a poutine as a side unless you love Sodium."}
{"text":"Saw that they launched a new special *jerk chicken sandwich* so obviously I couldn't pass this up. The mister has never been here before so it worked out perfect.

Service is, as always, great. Place is clean with few seating areas.

I got the jerk chicken sandwich - it was.. meh. I thought it would taste better for some reason. Yes, there was the oxtail gravy but it wasn't strong in jerk taste. Texture of the sandwich was good though. He got the house special sandwich - he really enjoyed it. I thought it was okay.

I would still come back because they do produce quality sandwiches even though it might not suit my taste. We spent $25 for two sandwiches."}
{"text":"I find myself refreshing my instagram page every Thursday morning to see what the weekly special is. Hands down best sandwich in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker for the House Special, based on his recommendation. I was not disappointed at all. It was delicious and I will definitely come back the next time I get a porchetta craving. The sandwich is a great combination of ingredients and flavours to compliment the porchetta. I really liked the bun that they use and the mustard is so good, I wish I could put it on all my sandwiches. The place itself is really small with only a few seats so it's great to just drop by and pick up a sandwich to go. Also to note they only take cash or interac and the house special is $10.10 with tax."}
{"text":"UHHHHHH... If I was dreaming eating a pork sandwich, I would dream about eating here. This place serves awesome sandwiches! 

The place was easy to find on King Street. You just spot the pig logo and you know its Porchetta & Co. The menu is quite simple as they have 3 sandwiches, sides and drinks to choose from. I ordered the house special sandwich. I went at during low peak hours so my order was completed in a few minutes.

At first glance at my sandwich, I thought it did not look too appealing but after one bite, I was blown away. The pork was juicy and tender and wasn't dry. I thought the mustard and hot sauce accommodated the sandwich perfectly. You can even add more mustard or hot sauce if you want if you do not think there is enough already.

Great place for lunch and I will definitely be back to try out their other 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Odd, another popular spot that EVERYONE I know has tried, except me. Sometimes you're on trend and sometimes you're so far behind you're asking Millenials how to use \"the Snapchat\" properly - I'm not getting old I swear.

I digress, I've read and see the amazing Porchetta Sammies all over Yelp and various food lists for years now and I finally got to try their classic porchetta sandwich last week at this location - new King West spot just west of Spadina.

Quick and easy ordering, a simple menu of delicious, not so heart healthy choices and as mentioned before exploring this menu too far, I had to try the classic sandwich that made them famous.

The pork was seasoned perfect and was very juicy still, there was a definite crunch from the skin (love the skin), and the truffle sauce and fresh baked bread pulled this sandwich together in a way that was just perfect.

Not much more to say on the topic.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Pork, wrapped in pork, wrapped in more pork... it is absolutely drool-worthy!  The seedy mustard and truffle sauce are an amazing addition.

These guys only serve one thing - porschetta, and they do that wonderfully!  Certainly not something you can have too often, but an occasional lunch here is a little slice of heaven.

Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"An amazing sandwich and I recommend everyone to try this at least once if in Toronto.

The House Special is amazing. The bread looks dry, but it's quite the opposite and wonderful. Great crust and it's soft on the inside. The porchetta was delicious. You get the juicy pieces with the super crunchy skin (only a few pieces were a tad dry). The sauces compliment the meat wonderfully. One sandwich is quite filling.

I am still thinking about how tasty it was."}
{"text":"do one thing and do it well. If you love pork get over there ASAP. Sandwich is moist, crisp, porky goodness."}
{"text":"Sandwich + Porchetta = estomac heureux.
Le Porchetta c'est tout petit mais en 5 minutes vous aurez un succulent sandwich fait maison accompagnÃ© d'une sauce champignons, moutarde et oignons.
IdÃ©al pour manger sur le pouce."}
{"text":"The Fried Chicken sandwich dressed like a big mac was SO GOOD. That first bite was incredible, and the sandwich itself very filling! I don't know what days they have this special but it was a Friday that I got it. Def would make this a regular go-to for juicy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"What's up, bland meat ?

Just when you though Toronto is going BBQ Bonanza, Porchetta and Co opens. It is all about the pig. Meat, Skin, Fat.

We had pork sandwich and pork plate.
Gotta say - I don't like places that weigh your food. 
The pros should weigh by the eye, and always give the client a feeling that he's getting \"that little extra shtickle\" rather than lab approach to food.

The meat is ok - but I've had better. Any REAL deli that respects itself sells meat with more taste, aroma and texture. Mine needed a lot of mustard. 
The fact that  the tastiest part was the crispy skin makes the whole experience skin-deep and makes me grunt for Drake's BBQ sloppy sandwich.

it's all about the packaging, because I'm sure the neighboring Portuguese butchers sell better meat and tastier sandwiches. 
But hey, they don't have a nice logo on the window or friends in Now magazines that can lure in the hipster clientele. 

Two Oinks was all I could render."}
{"text":"Delicious and tender! I got the house special. I advice getting it without the hot sauce. I'm a big fan of spicy, but Frank's hot sauce is not spicy, just vinagry. They have bottles on the tables and little containers you can take on the side. Also, get it with the Parmesan. The mozzarella sounded tempting but it was actually block mozz, not fresh."}
{"text":"I always look forward to having a sandwich from Porchetta Co. The pork is cooked to perfection. The bun is always fresh and soft. And their ginger ale, that I cannot remember the name brand of, is an excellent choice to accompany the sandwich. 

Delicious, and I highly recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"After seeing Porchetta & Co on Anthony Bourdain's \"The Layover\" my dad and I decided that, out of all the recommendations made on that episode, this one looked the most worthwhile and promising. We went on a weekday afternoon, off-hours, at around 2:30pm.

Ambiance:
A casual and clean space, although extremely limited counter-seating with five chairs in total - you will likely have to take your food to-go. Luckily, because my dad and I visited during a lull in the business day, we were able to have a seat. However, I do see this being a problem in the winter time and I suppose one can hope that they have a toaster oven available to them to reheat their sandwiches. 

Service:
The person at the cash register was very friendly and patient in explaining the different items on the menu. We ordered three porchetta sandwiches, one of which we wanted packaged to-go so we could bring it home for my sister. I really appreciated that they went the extra mile to put the sandwich in the warming oven while my dad and I ate in the restaurant so that her sandwich wouldn't get cold :)

Food:
I ordered the classic Porchetta Sandwich (\"The Sandwich\"), while my dad ordered the \"House Special\", that is, the Porchetta Sandwich with truffle sauce, parmesan cheese, mustard & hot sauce (mustard and hot sauce are available on the counters for everyone, though the \"House Special\" adds it in for you). My sandwich was delicious, with mouthwatering roast pork and delightful cracklings (crispy pork skin). I would have to say that the bun was a bit on the dry side, but perhaps it is supposed to be that way - any other bread might have become too soggy from the roast pork and all the sauces one might add. Overall, we really enjoyed our time there. 

Porchetta & Co serves up excellent porchetta sandwiches with the unique addition of cracklings, and offers a great selection of toppings. However, I wish that there was more seating available, especially when it is otherwise a long commute for me to get home (to a toaster oven)."}
{"text":"Had the OG fried chicken and the poutine.  The poutine is good, nothing special though.  The sandwich though. . .man!  The bun, the texture of the chicken, the taste and balance - all great!  Highly recommend it.

Would come back."}
{"text":"- decided to give them a second chance because i was a) hungry like a dinosaur and b) ready to try a porchetta sandwich with some toppings
- as part of b), my first time out, i got the sandwich \"au naturelle\", and it was bland and dry as hell
- this time, i got sauteed mushrooms and some tomato sauce, and it was pretty dang tasty. 
- the meat was still a little dry, but once you sauce that bad boy up, a transformation occurs.
- congrats porchetta, you won me over."}
{"text":"A lip-smackin lunch..
House special with truffle sauce - way to go."}
{"text":"Great hangover food. Love the pork, New is it right and portions are great! Very convenient to eat when youre on the go."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars - I guess I'm in the minority with this review.

I tried the Porchetta sandwich with mustard and mushrooms. It's all about the Pork - A homemade roast containing pork shoulder, pork belly and prosciutto. 

What can I say... it's OK I guess. To be honest, I thought the sandwich was a little dry. Also gagged on 1-2 bites that were way too fatty.

On the plus side, the sides dishes were good. The roasted potatoes were delicious and likely baked with the pork shoulder. Easily the highlight of my meal. Also had the coleslaw, it was the creamy style - not bad.

In no rush to return. Lots of better sandwiches available at the St. Lawrence market.

{"text":"This might be the best sandwich in the city!! Unfortunately the service was very unprofessional, they wouldn't switch the channel so we could cheer on on Canada in the world jrs."}
{"text":"Maybe it was too late in the day.  Maybe it was an off day.  Whatever the reason, my sandwich was dry, lacked flavor, and lacked crackle in the crackling.  It was a big let-down.  I've had much better at Meat and Bread in Vancouver.  Now THAT was a porchetta sandwich.  Pronto in Vancouver was pretty good too. Chinese roast pork done right is also better than what I was served at Porchetta and Co.  I think I should go again just to be sure cuz all these yelpers can't be wrong, can they?"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. It's speciality the porchetta sandwich is very good. GreAt place for meat eaters. Vegetarians stay away. It's better for take out or eating outside since it's quite small. And they do delivery which is a nice touch! It's definitely worth a try. Truffle sauce is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with the boyfriend as we sat around and thought about what we should have for dinner. We have been at the Dundas location before and enjoyed then food there (except for an awkward bun that crumbled apart). We got there and we were greeted by the cashier. We both got their chicken sandwich and shared an order of fries. The food came quite quickly; we were prepared to wait longer than we did. The sandwich was delicious.  One of the ingredients on this sandwich is hot sauce. The hot sauce wasn't just a slap of heat that numbs your tongue-it was actually a very tasty hot sauce. The fries were good too, but I don't have anything special to say about them. They're fries. They're good. My boyfriend and I will certainly return. Next time we'll actually get a porchetta sandwich, as the two precious times we got the chicken sandwich. Also, the chicken sandwich portion is big; there is no way I'd have been able to have both a sandwich and order of fries to myself. I had to struggle to finish the sandwich even with just half of the fries.  I was determined to finish, and in the end, I was victorious. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"So good I forgot to take a picture! LOVED this sandwich, thrilled by the rich, unctuous porkyness of it all.

And while I typically love my food, especially sandwiches, with a bit of heat, I have to admit that the non-spicy version of their classic sandwich truly has that perfect balance of mustard and mayo and perfect porky flavor, that was superior to the spicy version of the same sandwich.

If I had to find something wrong, I would struggle, but perhaps say that slightly more crunchy-fatty pork filling would it be an improvement, but the balance in the flavor of this sandwich was very close to perfect.

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Ordered the House Special Sandwich and the P&Co poutine from Uber Eats. The food came within 10 minutes and it was definitely disappointing. Not sure if this was just made in a rush but the poutine was super salty with just two small pieces pork. The pork was good and crispy however the gravy was super spicy. The sandwich lacked flavour other than the buffalo sauce. The bread was stale & hard. Expected a lot more from this restaurant. The packaging is cute though."}
{"text":"Best coleslaw ever! Porchetta plates and a sandwiches are good too but like others on here I think they could have more meat. I've been a fan for years and normally go to the Dundas W location where I feel like the sandwich portions are, or used to be bigger. 
The fried chicken sandwich is wicked good. 
The soft shell crab sandwich is amazing."}
{"text":"As we were driving down my friend had to call ahead, which I thought was odd. She said it was soooo good that sometimes they sell out before the end of the night and we would have to wander the streets hungry!

But luckily they still had some pork left. It was my first time and despite the simple 2 item menu I was confused what to get. I got what Porchetta recommended for a first timer. It was delicious! 

It was so good my friend ordered a second then she compliant about over eating. Thank you Porchetta for contributing to the obesity epidemic. J/K, she would probably over eat at other places as well."}
{"text":"My last time in Toronto, my cuz picked me up a sandwich from here and I knew I wanted to come back. Finally had a chance today, and I wasn't disappointed. The setup here is intimate, some bar chairs and a few regular tables. Apparently they updated their menu (which I took a picture of). But I knew what I wanted: the House Special Porchetta Sandwich. Porchetta with this appropriately named thing called \"crackling\" (chicharron), truffle Sauce, parmesan, mustard and hot sauce. Oh man oh man. And the bread was amazing too! Not too thick and kinda crispy. All kinds of textures and flavors going on, well constructed (didn't fall apart), I loved it! I might come back... Tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Straight goods, I'm not a fan of the porchetta sandwich. There, I said it.  But what I can't stop raving about is that delectable fried chicken sandwich - OH MY GOODNESS.  I've already written a review for the King West location, but this sandwich is so good it warrants another review.  This is the original Porchetta&Co. location and it's a very small spot - maybe 4 -5 seats if you decide to have your meal there. Service is great, super friendly, and quick to prepare. I had the Fried Chicken sandwich with bacon, Parmesan and Caesar dressing - douse that with their hot sauce and you're pretty much set.  I got over ambitious and ordered a side of coleslaw as well.  It's pretty good, and a nice mix between creamy and vinegary. 

The sandwich is an ample portion and comes to $11-12. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Three words. 

FRIED. CHICKEN. SANDWICH. 

that's all you really need. It's buttermilk fried chicken served on a soft bun, topped with hot sauce, creamy dill sauce to counteract the heat, pickles and lettuce.  The portion size is ample - it has the potential to be a shareable sandwich, but who are we kidding, after one bite, you won't want anyone getting near your delicious meal.  It's comes in around $10 for just the sandwich. Not sure about the other location, but they had beer here the last time I visited. 

Service is always friendly and prompt. The space fills up quickly during peak periods but there's a little patio area out front on King West if you're up for a bit of people watching, though you might be too busy demolishing your meal."}
{"text":"The House Special is spectacular. Really, it's all about the cracklin'. I'm sure the other items are delicious, but I usually just find one thing and stick with it, and this hasn't steered me wrong here."}
{"text":"Oh my, I don't know where to start...their super delicious sandwiches have made me speechless. I got the classic porchetta sandwich and added some truffle mayo. It was divine! It came with cracklings and a good amount of juicy,  tasty and oh so tender porchetta. Their buns were spectacular as well! 

If they had more seating inside,  I would have given them a 5! The store was too tiny  with only a handful of seats so you pretty much have to find a place outside of the store to enjoy your sandwich. 

I didn't notice that they offered a house special porchetta sandwich with a couple of side dressings included. It was a good deal instead of getting the sandwich and adding individual sides. 

I took home a pound of porchetta for my kids and it came with some cracklings. I then bought some Portuguese buns from the Portuguese bakery in front of the store but they weren't the same. The ones used by Porchetta and Co were much better."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches! The porchetta was tender and the addition of cracklings made such a huge difference! Love their truffle mayo!"}
{"text":"Yum! I never made it to the Dundas location because the hours seemed a bit limited, but I was excited to finally try it. 

The pork lived up to my expectations, loved the crackling that came with it too. My friend and I had pork plates with rapini and fries as sides. The rapini was okay but I preferred the fries, they were crispy salty fresh. Maybe I am just not a big rapini fan.

I would come back and try the sandwich next time."}
{"text":"3.5

Very small location with about 4 seats so more of a order and go affair.

Selection is small and it's essentially their sandwich or build your own with their ingredients. Nothing else. But for what they have they do it well.

The pork sandwich that they are known for was great. The pork was juicy and tender. Sauces were balanced and not over powering.

I would have given them the full 4 stars but the coleslaw was plain and only used green cabbage and drenched with the creamy dressing.

All in all, worth the try just stay away from the coleslaw."}
{"text":"I got the house special sandwich.  Honestly, it was just okay.  They could put a bit more meat and the crunchy bits in there for a $10 sandwich.  It was tasty but nothing that I would make a special trip for."}
{"text":"Went to the location in Montreal over the summer. Tiny joint but amazing service by the lone employee. Got here at 2pm, immediately was shouted at that they ran out of buns. No problem I wanted to pick up two dinner plates. They said they only had enough meat for one dinner but had fried chicken. But again no bun as they normally only sell a chicken sandwich. Guess they were trying to accommodate the fact that the had nothing to sell. They said to choose a side, I chose roasted potatoes and again was told they were out but had fries. Oh did I mention there were two giant porchettas in plain site. Perhaps they were just props but its doubtful. I mentioned that I tried to calling but there was no answer, turns out the number listed in Yelp and on the website are for the Dundas location which was closed today. The manager then tells me, they don't advertise because they are too busy and don't need any more customers and that he doesn't even know the phone number to the location we are standing in. Guess I won't be ordering anything from this place as they claim they don't have food which is clearly displayed and they don't need anymore customers. Epic disappointment, too bad because the Montreal store rocks!"}
{"text":"Order the house special sandwich which consist of porchetta and cracklings with Parmesan, truffle, hot sauce and mustard seeds. The crackling and the truffle sauce does bring the sandwich to another level. Definitely would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I was not sure at first.  This place packs flavour and satisfaction.  I have had both sandwiches with various sides.  I will say the rapini side is a refreshing change.  The baked beans were awesome,  they start off sweet and then move to smoky with a spicy kick at the end.

I have been to both locations and it is consistent.  

Enjoy all they have to offer.

I wish they would open one more near where ever I am working! 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came in for a bite.  Was excited after smelling the place up.

I ordered the chicken sandwich.  It was stupendous.  Way better then any other fried chicken I have had in city.

I recommend going in hungry.  I had the rapini side which was great and a surprise when it comes to sides.

I would definitely knock an old woman with a cane down to get In here first.

Enjoy!

{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. There's not a weak link on the menu. Delicious, satisfying, and quick. Simply perfect. Also, probably the best coleslaw I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"We noticed the cute pig logo for a quite a while before it opened. Our curiosity about this place was satisfied with a belly full of delicious food tonight. 

I guess the throwback cafeteria style back lit menu boards are the latest restaurant aesthetic as that's the first thing you enter the small space. The are only a few menu items (stick to what you're great at right?), and the orders come pretty quickly. 

The sandwiches where really good! We had their porchetta special, which had a thin layer of rich, delicious porchetta. So good! Any more meat and it would have been too rich. The grainy mustard cut right through the fat. The crusty white bun was great too. We also had the Korean fried chicken sandwich. It was a bit too saucy for me, but still so good. The thick juicy thigh meat was very well done. 

I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing -- the very epitome of doing one thing, and doing it well.  After much trial and error, I think the platonic combination of condiments is: truffle sauce, mushrooms, and rapini (with the grainy mustard and hot sauce, too).

Soups are also spectacular here, as are the baked beans."}
{"text":"The sandwich you always wanted your dad to be.

With 57 reviews already, there's not much more to be said, so I'll be brief and I'll do it in haiku.

Porchetta & Co.
Salt, fat, crackling, prosciutto.
Haiku says it best.

One final addition, if you haven't been before, get your first one naked (the sammy, that is) 'cause that's the real deal."}
{"text":"Really delish Porchetta sandwich...but sorry, doesn't beat Roli Roti in San Francisco...which is still the most amazing porchetta sandwich (and seriously ANY sandwich) EVER. You have to taste that to believe its amazingness.

Anyway. 
Back to Porchetta & Co. 
Friendly service, fairly quick prep (definitely a PLUS compared to Roli Roti, which is an average 60 min wait).

I got the sandwich with truffle sauce and some hot sauce. The truffle sauce added a smoky layer to the porchetta. The place has pretty much NO seating space. When i was there, this couple shared a sandwich...and when they were done, I thought they'd leave, but NO, they decided to get another one. WTF. 
There're 2 of you...this is a porchetta sandwich. Why did you think you 2 could share ONE sandwich? So annoying. Get 2 sandwiches at the same time, wolf it down and get your butts out the door so others can EAT. They were probably vegetarians who were cheating on their diets. Amateurs. 

OK, back to the sandwich. 
Juicy, tasty meat, Awesome crunchy bits of skin. MmMmMmMm. SO good. Slight smoky taste. The only thing i'd say is that the buns...could have been wiped with porchetta juices instead of butter/oil. I think that's what makes the Roli Roti sandwich a step above. 
And yea, I live for the crunchy bits, so it'd have been even more amazing with more crunchy bits...MMMm

But yeah...porchetta sandwiches ROCK and Porchetta & Co.  has a good product going on..."}
{"text":"You need the house special in your life! We came to Porchetta and co based off a recommendation. I can't begin to tell you how amazing and flavorful the sandwich was. The pork was juicy and tender, and all of the toppings worked together beautifully. I have never had a better sandwich. We also had a side of coleslaw and rapini, both were fantastic. This is place is a must!"}
{"text":"Yum and yum. Sometimes you just need porchetta and where else would you go other than Porchetta & Co. 
I've walked by this place 1,000 time and finally went in for what have to be the best sandwich. Had the house sandwich with a kale salad. Both awesome. The sandwich is spicy mustard tender pork and crackle. How do they do that? I probably don't want to know more about crackle but I enjoyed it. The kale salad was great with creamy dressing (don't put the extra squeeze of lemon on it since it's already has enough lemon). Small bits of cheese and bite size kale bites- I don't like grazing through big bites of kale. 
My next try? Kale salad with porchetta on top. I bet they do that!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich place. Strangely enough, I enjoy their chicken sandwiches more than their pork ones because I feel the pork is under-seasoned. I always look forward to eating food from here, regardless."}
{"text":"Just freakin' delicious, everything they sell!!

Porchetta sandwich with the Cracklin is literally like crack!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot for years now. The house special (porchetta, crackling, mustard, hot & truffle sauce) is consistently outstanding, definitely one of my favourite sandwiches in the city. I have to say though, there was more variety in the weekly specials a few years back. It seems like they are only doing variations on the Fried chicken sandwich every week now. This wouldn't be so bad if they actually gave you a descent amount of chicken in the sandwich. There was more batter than chicken in the last one I had! If you're looking for an amazing porchetta sandwich try this place, but if you want a sick fried Chicken sandwich head to Brock Sandwich."}
{"text":"Tasha and I were walking on Dundas St W with our son Gabriel and our dog Gracie when we stumbled upon this little gem of a place.  Being the meat lover that I am I was immediately drawn and just had to place an order.  We got two sandwiches.  The first had the famous truffle oil and rapini and the second had tomato sauce.

The flavour from both sandwiches was succulently divine.  I think I might have to get another one today.

Service was very friendly and helpful.

It's always great to find a spot that does one thing so well.

I recommend.

Tasha's favourite: Rapini with truffle oil sauce
Daniel's favourite: with tomato sauce"}
{"text":"I had the house special which was amazing... the porchetta was juicy and tender, the crackling gave it a nice tasty crunch, all without being too greasy....would recommend this place to anyone except vegetarians of course!

{"text":"I got the house special and I liked it. The fries were above average. But I also walked 10-15 minutes to give Porchetta a shot and while I enjoyed my lunch, I am not certain I will make that walk regularly. Good, but maybe not good enough to justify my walk for me."}

{"text":"3.5 Star

I ordered the House Special sandwich, and though I enjoyed it, it didn't quite reach the level I was hoping for. The pork is quite good quality and I really enjoyed the crunchy parts - which helped round up my review to a 4. Even as someone who enjoys really strong flavour, I found the mix of the vinegar-based hot sauce and grain mustard a bit overpowering. The truffle sauce and Parmesan got lost in it and even the pork to some degree. I also found the price a little on the steep side, though I know it's good quality pork. As I look at their menu, it's hard to understand the nearly $2 price difference between the house special and their breakfast sandwich which both have the pork and crackling.

Still fairly enjoyable and I would even return for the same sandwich, but would ask for light hot sauce for the sake of tasting all the components."}
{"text":"Read about this place on a blog - sounded great and it was their second location so they've had success elsewhere.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the sandwich was really good but I do have a few comments.

First, the good.  The sandwich was excellent - super tender, good flavors and big.  I got the special sandwich which at $9 comes with parmesan, truffle sauce and mustard.  It was really yummy and filling.  I think the price point was reasonable and it was a good unique sandwich.

Now the bad, and there are a few.  First of all, the service by the female cashier was fairly poor.  Perhaps she could have smiled.  Second, the two sides we got were terrible.  The fries tasted like they were soaked in vinegar and the coleslaw (at a whopping $4) was essentially shredded lettuce with vinegar poured on it.  Both of them were terrible!

Save yourself the money and just order the sandwich.  It's filling enough."}
{"text":"I've heard many of my friends rave about this place before I came here. I never wanted to venture out to its original location, but this one is close by my house so I figured I'd give it a try. 

I got the house sandwich, which is basically the porchetta with truffle sauce, cheese, mustard and hot sauce. I thought the sauce drowned out the porchetta a bit. It probably could've done with less of it. 

It was good, but I wouldn't say amazing. It may be because I've been spoiled by the porchetta sandwich from Meat and Bread in Vancouver. I thought there wasn't enough crackling in this one and it just got a bit too much by the end. 

I'd be willing to try the original location to see if maybe it's be"}
{"text":"Decent special sandwiches. Pricey at around 10.95. Cash or debit only. Had both the soft shell crab and calamari and bacon sandwiches. Good, a little too saucy. Porchetta is nothing to brag about. Tastes like Chinese roast pork. The idea seemed more attractive than the reality."}
{"text":"My first opportunity for the soft shelled crab sandwich, and I have to say I was disappointed. The bun was smaller than your average hotdog bun, the crab looked small on the bun, it was fairly oily, and very little crab flavour. For $11.00? Way too much money for way too little of everything."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Even though the pork is advertised the fried chicken (on special thurs-Sunday) is MUCH better #Drool"}
{"text":"Ever since I had these sandwiches, I have been thinking about them, talking about them, recommending them and yes, I have personally taken some of my friends for a visit. 

The place is accessible by streetcar. I don't recommend driving. This joint is quite small. Mind you, it's a take-out place. You can just get the sandwich or the sandwich  with a side. All toppings are extra. The bun, the meat, the crackling...everything just comes together wonderfully. 

Make sure you check out their menu before you go, so you don't hold up the line. Let people get their sandwiches! 

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Great sand-a-wich.  Porchetta was yummy, moist on inside, but nice crackling on the outside.    Bring cash, no credit/debit.  Also closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"When I first walked up to Porchetta and saw the same steamy windows that I often see at my house when my mother is cooking up a storm - I knew it would be good! 

The huge lineup (about 3 people waiting to dine-in and 2 waiting for take-out) in such a small space is also a sure sign that what I was about to experience would be gastronomical!

Marinated pork shoulder that is wrapped in prosciutto and then wrapped in cured pork belly and baked?  Hell yeah!  The curing process takes days... I am never a fan of \"marinate for 4 hours\" - marinate overnight or more!!!

At $20/lb my expectations were nothing short of sky high.  When I was carefully watching the staff prep others' dishes, I couldn't help bu think to myself \"Gee that looks a lot like Chinese roast pork with the fat and crunchy pork rinds.\"  

I came here today because I saw the Tweet that their daily special was a Porchetta Grilled Cheese (you had me at Cheese!) with Caramelized Onions.  You could make that a combo with their Tomato Parmesan (they actually grate fresh Parmesan) for $10.95 but I just opted for the sandwich.

I also ordered a side of the Truffle Sauce - just for kicks.  

The first bite I took was surprisingly dry, maybe I just got the odd piece?  But every bite after that was succulent, juicy, tender and moist which was complemented by a crispy pork skin and sweet caramelized onions.  I don't know what kind of bread they use for their grilled cheese (not their standard bun), but it was mighty good!  The bread itself was crunchy and was grilled to a golden brown.  

You really don't need any condiments.  I felt the Truffle Sauce added nothing to my sandwich and actually detracted away from the natural flavours of the Porchetta.  My word of advice, just get the Porchetta and skip the sides!  

I did notice however that a lot of people ordered rapini as their side.  I think next time, I will just order a Porchetta plate and forego the empty carbs that are otherwise known as buns.  

I would definitely recommend coming here if you haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"We ordered the House Special Sandwich and shared it between the three of us since we were in that zone of not being too hungry but yet still wanting to try out the sandwich.  The House Special Sandwich contains 4 oz. of porchetta and crackling with truffle sauce, parmesan, mustard, and hot sauce.  You order this at the counter and then they call your number."}
{"text":"Tried this place out through the ritual app, we ordered the fried chicken plate with arancini as the side and it was GOOD! Came with two big pieces of fried chicken which was surprising since most places tend to over charge for small unsatisfying portions. Arancini as the plate side was good but it only was one arancini ball :( if we knew it was only one we would have ordered the fries as a side instead ( they looked good in the restaurant). Would come back to try their fried chicken sandwich specials I see them post on Instagram!"}
{"text":"loved it. one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Look them up on Instagram for special daily sandwiches."}
{"text":"The original Porchetta on Dundas between Euclid and Palmerston is smaller than the one at King and Portland.  Yes that place is small but this one is even smaller.  How small?  Maybe enough seating for 5 people inside kind of small.  Size doesn't matter really but when you're talking about sandwiches it does.  Quality too right?  

Well Porchetta even though it's their name has a pretty decent fried chicken sandwich as well.  It may not be their name but it's good enough that it probably could be.  The fried chicken sandwich I had this time was the Korean fried chicken one.  It becomes \"Korean\" because of sauce and kimchi that gets put into the sandwich I suppose.  I'm a really big fan of Korean fried chicken and I hate to say this really isn't it although it's a twist on their original chicken sandwich which in my opinion is better.  

The Korean version seems a bit too lubricated for my liking and when it gets like that it's a slippery slide of whatever is between the buns and your attempts to eat the sandwich with any kind of neatness to it.  It's hard to eat because the sandwich is so wet inside and because of that I'd prefer any other previous version of chicken sandwich I've had at this location or the King street location because of it.  The taste is good mind you because well it is Porchetta."}
{"text":"I never knew what porchetta was until just a week ago. I had transitioned through several variations of vegetarianism in the last 10 years, so I am a novice with meat, to my dismay. Therefore, eating here was an exploration for me both mentally and gustatorily.  My coworker recommended it to me, as it neighboured my new office and since then we have frequented twice: once dining in and once as take out.

Our first visit was during the lunch time rush. Whereas Wilbur Mexicana always has a congested line, this establishment easily served us while still buzzing with diners, often forming small lines now and then. Trust me, their workers orchestrate their functions very well, so the wait time will be no more than a few minutes. The decor has a factory-themed aesthetic to it, which i find to be quite ubiquitous with most popular grab and go places now.  Seating is limited, but the turn around time of diners is quick, so you won't have any difficulty getting a spot. Otherwise, you can get the sandwich to go, which was what we did for our second trip (not because there weren't seats, but because we had a meeting).  I must emphasize that when you get them to go they taste the same as when you dine in, unlike the take out items of other restaurants that tend to exist as the soggier and/or smaller failures of their original, dine-in dishes. 

I have only ever eaten the House Special because it was the easiest to order.  Also, it's safe to say that the porchetta sandwiches did not disappoint.  The meat was tendy, well-seasoned, and juicy.  The crispy kaiser buns complemented the meat, acting to balance the fatty flavour.  Surprisingly, there were even pork rinds inside, giving each bite an extra crunch. I would not go as far as to say that the pork rinds were necessary, as I didn't find them flavourful enough, but this is coming from someone who is a newcomer with meat. 

I would definitely recommend giving these sandwiches a try if you like pork and eating meat as the main component of your meal. This is family, friend, and date friendly."}
{"text":"This location is sort of tiny and a step or two below street level.  There's maybe enough seating for 16 or so at tables and another 6 or so along the wall.  The interior sort of reminds me of being underground in Super Mario Brothers as there so many mechanical pipes everywhere.  The ceiling has exposed slatted wood just like their same building neighbor, Pizzeria Libretto.

It's pay at the counter and they will call your number out to pickup.

I did what I usually don't do.  I ordered something that is not the name of the place itself.  I mean the mouth watering pork belly - you know the same area of the pig that bacon comes from...

I ended up getting the special that day which was a \"Banh Mi\" chicken sandwich.  It's like their regular chicken (which is pretty awesome by the way) with a different sauce and slaw type cuts of veggies on top.  The sandwich was pretty awesome as their chicken is a very healthy and generous cut, breaded and put on a nice fresh large roll.

Next time I'll actually get the porchetta sandwich but the chicken is nothing to sneeze at.  2 chicken sandwiches with a side of fries came out to 25 bucks even."}
{"text":"Had the porchetta and it definitely lived up to the hype. Although I found it to be overly salty, the bun and their mustard made up for it. Would definitely revisit, and would ask for extra mustard as the saltiness makes the porchetta a bit on the dry side.

Be prepared to not have a seat! Location is fairly small and only have a few bar stools available"}
{"text":"Mmmm pork.

Marinated pork shoulder, wrapped in proscuitto, wrapped in pork belly, and baked in the oven. 

I have to say the sandwich was really good (i got it with tomato suace, but next time might skip it) i thought it would be too dry without it but maybe the truffle butter would have been more complementing. I tasted too much of the tomato sauce. 
The bun was amazing, soft and crunchy. 
I felt like I didn't taste enough pork and was disappointed a little. 

Still really good for a lunch time place in the area. we were there before 12 and was able to sit in the 4 stools in the place. After about 1pm the place was packed with a line up outside!

I would come back for a quite bite if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Friends brought me out to this joint do I didn't know what I was walking into. We ordered 2 sandwiches which were both very good..We had to wait 15 mins for their chicken since they had just run out of it. The original signature sandwich was really good. It was my favourite out of the two as I'm not a huge fan of buffalo sauce on the chicken sandwich. The chicken was also very messy to eat. If you walk by and see remnants of food outside, it's probably the chicken sandwich. There were tons of it while we sat on the benches outside the joint but hey, the dogs seemed to love it. I would definitely recommend this place and go back for their original sandwich."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto for work and vacation for 3 days and I had Porchetta & Co. twice because it was just that good. My biggest regret was not coming here a third time on Saturday for their Breakfast Sandwich. Easily one of the best sandwiches I have had and probably ever will. The toppings add up quickly making it an expensive sandwich, but well worth it!

Tip: If you're going to go out of your way to come here, do it right and don't skimp on the toppings that you want. I skimped on my first sandwich and regretted it immediately. I didn't get a chance but I would also try to ask for extra crackling. 

I went with The Sandwich with truffle sauce, parmesan, mushrooms, rapini and extra meat. It was heavenly and I'm just wishing that my company sends me back to Toronto ASAP."}
{"text":"Look no further for a porchetta sandwich, this place knows how to do it right. From the basic porchetta itself to the toppings such as truffle sauce and parmesan, Porchetta & Co knows how to make a sandwich. There will be lineups here during rush hour, but the line moves fast and this place is good for a quick meal to dine-in or to go. If sandwiches are too carb heavy for the \"health conscious\", Porchetta & Co also offers a Plate option where you get porchetta and a side of your choice (i.e. coleslaw, rapini, roasted potatoes etc.). if you choose to dine in, keep in mind this is a fast food joint and there aren't many tables available so come early if you wish to eat in."}
{"text":"Whoa! Soft shell crab po boy with panchetta crackling on top with spicy mayo is probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten. It was AMAZING.  If you haven't tried it yet, you must. 

GO.
NOW."}
{"text":"There is only one item on the menu, and it is very good!

The place is small, so it's ideal for take-out. The service is quick and friendly. The sourdough bread for the sandwich is incredibly fresh!

All around, a good place for a delicious, quick pork sandwich"}
{"text":"OMG. When I die and go to heaven, I pray and hope that there's a Porchetta & Co up there because I don't think I could live without ever being able to eat Porchetta's again.

I cannot even begin to describe how good this place is. And I don't even eat pork. The portions seemed a little small but that could be because it was so damn good, that I wanted another one... and another one... and another one. Oh, just put me in a coma already.

The restaurant itself is tiny and only has about 4 seats so it be best that you get your order to go but it's so good while it's still warm and crispy and oozing with juices. So if there's a spot for you to sit down, own that seat and don't leave until you're seeing stars and have to waddle out of there. Otherwise, as soon as you step foot outside, find an alley and devour your sandwich like an wild animal.

This will be my to-go spot for me in Toronto, which includes Burger's Priest and Guu. Good lord there's a lot of places to eat in Toronto.

{"text":"Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was really yummy :) the chicken was nice and crispy and the sauce had a nice kick. I only got the one sandwich and the portion was just right, however for those who have a larger appetite would recommend getting something else on the side."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are Amazing!!! Words can't do the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich the justice it deserves. And the porchetta sandwich was delicious! There are no words! We inhaled our meal."}
{"text":"Pork is delicious in almost any form, that is a fact, but at Porchetta & co the noble swine gets the royal treatment. I recently popped in here on a Saturday afternoon after hearing the rave reviews and this place absolutely lived up to the hype. 

The place is a hole in the wall with enough room to seat about 5-6 people and on this occasion it was quite busy. I ordered a porchetta sandwich with mushrooms, grain mustard, onions and truffle sauce on the side as well as a side order of roasted potatoes. My sandwich was ready shortly after, the pork was absolutely incredible, so tender and juicy with just the perfect ratio of meat to fat. The sandwich also contained deep fried crackling (pig skin) which added some salt and a bit of a crunch. The strong grain mustard was the perfect compliment to cut through the fatty meat but the truffle sauce was unnecessary IMO as all it did was mask the natural flavour of the meat (it was more of a truffle mayo than a sauce). The bread was so fresh, soft in the middle and just a little crispy on the outside. This was truly a perfectly made sandwich. The side of roasted potatoes was good but certainly not mind-blowing, the potatoes actually went well with the truffle sauce. My meal with a drink ran me about $13 but was well worth it. 

The place itself is really tiny with a couple counters along the wall to sit and eat. The service was efficient and my food was made very quickly, this definitely a grab and go type place. If you find yourself wandering around Dundas West keep an eye out for this place and be sure to grab yourself a sandwich."}
{"text":"I am in town from the States for Fan Expo and thought I would check this place out. I had the  House Special porchetta sandwich and fries with truffle mayo. The sandwich was delicious, the meat was tender and there was enough acid on the sandwich to cut the richness. The bread was incredible. The fries were crisp and thick, more like British chips. 

My only drawbacks to the meal was that i felt like there needed to be more meat to make a more balanced sandwich. Also, the truffle sauce tasted more like mayo and Dijon mustard mixed together instead of a truffle flavor. It was tasty but not yhe flavor I was expecting. 

Overall, I would come back!"}
{"text":"I love the house special sandwich. Great in the summer when you can walk to Trinity Bellwoods park and picnic with it.   The truffle sauce takes it over the top and the whole mustard seeds, it's a great mixture of flavours.  I want one already!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you're searching for a hearty, delicious sandwich. These sandwiches will keep you full and satisfied for a few hours. When choosing your toppings I highly recommend the truffle sauce and parmesan with the house made mustard. I promise you won't be disappointed by the crispy pork shoulder."}
{"text":"Okay, one-hit wonders are my favourites.  Being good at more than one thing is over-rated.  Thankfully, Porchetta & Co's one thing is repeatable, and will help them stay in business for a long time to come (nigh until society finally sheds the final vestiges of barbarity and humankind goes vegan en masse).  Until that time, crunchy pig skin rules!

Everything about it is perfection.  Perfect portion fills you up without overdoing it, perfect porchetta with all that crunchy skin, and even the bun (from Petite Thuet, I believe) is perfect, crispy crusted, but not too dense, and able to magically hold in the sandwich from beginning to end without anything falling out, or the bread itself falling apart.

I'm glad I don't live near this place, otherwise I'd need bariatric surgery."}
{"text":"I really really love their \"The House Special Sandwich\". 
If you're looking for a quick and tasty lunch get this sandwich."}
{"text":"The porchetta is mouthwatering, the toppings to die for and the toasted crispy ciabatta bun adds the perfect finish! Reminds me of the late night hot table I always crave at Italian weddings...the only thing I wish I could have added is hot Italian oil/peppers... But delicious regardless! 

The fried chicken sandwich was HUGE but sadly, looked better than it actually was. It wasn't terrible..it was still good, I just didn't LOVE it (like I did the porchetta). The coleslaw was a great addition and definitely something I'd get again. It was the perfect mix of creamy and vinegary. 

I'm already dreaming of the next time I could sink my teeth into another porchetta sandwich... Mmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Small joint with room for 3 people to sit. Only a few things on the menu but they do them well. A little pricey but super tasty. Definitely worth it to stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent porchetta...really good with a bit of crunchy. Hard to park nearby at times though. It was worth it. I got the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwich for the price. 

In Toronto I figured porchetta would be priced as a novelty item so I appreciate this place not taking advantage of people!

Great tasting sauces on the house special--would certainly recommend giving this a try!"}
{"text":"Heard about it on IG and went to try it on my break at work. I tried the classic sandwich I believe and brought it back to work. My coworker and I both tried The sandwich. In my option the sandwich was a bit to salty. It over powered and I just felt like chugging a whole water bottle after eating it. My coworker also said it was to salty for her liking. I heard the calamari sandwich was good so I may be going back to try that."}
{"text":"Second time try this burger out!
The Porchetta home special is sooo good!!!
(Although the fry chicken that I tried the first time was pretty awesome as well!)
Their salad and rice ball are both very yummy as well! Deff recommend to get with the sandwich!

The staff was superrrr friendly, smiley and nice as well! Coz I need a cup of coffee for the morning wake-up but they don't sell coffee at this place so I asked for recommendation. He told me one across street was pretty good so I went for it! Turned out it was pretty good!!! :)

Will deff go back to here soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 but I feel like my experience there with my girlfriend was a miss. We arrived and saw the menu which makes you water at the mouth, plus I've had co-workers rave reviews and on Yelp it has even better reviews... Anyways we decided to get 2 of the House Special Sandwiches and a Supreme Fries and I'll just be blunt about them. Everything in the sandwich compliments it very well, if the bread was not crusty it would just be a porky-fatty mess which would make it hard for me to come back. Compared with their instagram photos my sandwich looked a little lackluster but I guess I gotta get the \"sandwich of the day\" specials rather than the original. The supreme fries were good but not $5.95 good.. Might as well get like 2 crappy Taco Bell ones which are comparable with these.. I should have just got a poutine"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw these great reviews! The place has charm with high stools,  antique collections and a cute logo and menu design. 

Went with the special of the day: buttermilk fried chicken grilled cheese with caramelized grilled onions,  bbq sauce and smoked bacon. 

Friendly service,  nice ambiance, I don't why it took so long to bring out when they said the sandwich is premade. 

Anyway,  it looked nothing like what I expected. The sandwich was so small! And when I think of buttermilk fried chicken,  I think of crispy,  flaky,  popcorn chicken with juicy moist meat. This one is as flat as two pieces of bacon,  and the chicken tasted like dark meat or something,  I don't what it is about the flavour, but I didn't enjoy it. Furthermore,  the bread was very dry, there was more bacon than anything else, and the sandwich was incredibly salty. After two bites,  I couldn't eat anymore.

For $10 on a small salty sandwich, my money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great porchetta sandwiches at a decent price.  The meat was soft and flavourful and the bun was delicious. Grainy mustard and hot sauce are an almost mandatory addition to throw in some flavour.  My only complaint is that the sandwich could have used a bit more crackling and the eat-in space is rather small, so it's best to get the food to go and enjoy outside if possible."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better when it comes to porchetta!!! Perfect touch of everything important"}
{"text":"I'm a pork lover, and I'd heard so much hype about this place but finally had a chance to give it a go and I can't help but feel disappointed.

I ordered 1 plate, and 1 sandwich.
When you look on the company website, and when you think porchetta in general, you think of thick slices of pork. Assumably with a sandwich, you expect the pieces to probably be smaller to spread easier in the bun. Well the meat on both the sandwich and the plate looked exactly the same. And with the plate, you don't have the bun covering up the grease and huge chunks of fat. Don't get me wrong, I expect there to be fat. But not like giants chunks of inedible mediocrity found here. I also expected slices, not small chunks of meat that looked like it was scooped out with a ladle into the takeout container.
As for the sandwich... Needs more sauce selection. Am I the only one who thinks a BBQ sauce on pork makes sense? Because the marinara was pretty blah.

Also, don't bother ordering hot peppers. Instead of being able to put diced hot peppers on the sandwich, for 95 cents they give you a whole takeout container with a handful of whole jalapeno peppers. Why would I want to put a bunch of whole peppers in the sandwich. Or better yet, why would I ever just want them on the side?

My dining partners comments was \"the bun was the best part\". 
I think that sums things up pretty well."}
{"text":"Definitely a tasty Porchetta sandwich! Here is what I love about the place: 
- great porchetta with crispy skin left on
- amazing bun...I swear the bread is almost as good as the porchetta
- grey poupon mustard (the thick seedy one)
 - simply menu, they know what they do well and stick to it!

Go here! So far, this is the only place that serves proper porchetta in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Had these sandwiches from Porchetta food truck this year at the Beer Fest. A-May-Zing! I'd definitely love to actually visit the store."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place that coming in with high expectations was a huge understatement. I'm happy to report that they exceeded them.

I got a porchetta sandwich with truffle sauce, parmesan,! Mustard, hot sauce, rapini and extra meat. Damn. Just damn. Not only did I get it in record time, but the quality of each component was on point. These people are masters of treating pork with the respect it deserves.

Add to that a great staff and interesting decor. 5 stars solidly.

PLEASE open a location in Vaughan! You'd make a killing."}
{"text":"Got the house special: .. It's good. The bun was very fresh, crispy and moist. Over all flavour was nice. I find the hot sauce and the mustard the added over powers the taste of the whole sandwich.. As a person from vancouver.. I can't help to compare to vancouver's meat and bread's porchetta... Vancouver has more flavour."}
{"text":"Food: 5 Stars
Service: 4 Stars
Ambience: 4 Stars

I have been here twice now and both times my experience was enjoyable. I tried the house special my first time here and it was good. Meat was nice and juicy and I loved the bread. Something satisfying about that crunch when you bite into it. My most recent visit I had their bacon, mushroom, melt sandwich which I believe was the special of the day. I wish I had bought two. The fried chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, the cheese was nice and gooey, and the mushroom sauce just bought everything together. 

I ordered my food to go so I did not spend too much time in the restaurant. You basically walk in and you can grab a menu to your right or your can just check out the board above the cashier. Service was prompt and I waited probably only waited 5 minutes for my food. There is a good amount of seating available as well.

I definitely recommend trying out Porchetta. I have enjoyed it thoroughly both times I was there and I cannot wait until I visit again."}
{"text":"Hard pressed for me to try this out because I can make a mean Porchetta.  I often passed by their location on Dundas West.  Finally decided to try out the King West location.  The place is tiny in the lower level of the building just east of Portland.  Their line ups can be quite impressive.  Here's the verdict.

Food:  Porchetta original with rapini and mustard.  It was the right bread vessel for this Porchetta.  It was fairly lean and tender.  The problem I have with this is that it could've had much better flavour.  It was bland maybe needed more time to marinate?  Or maybe simply not enough herbs and spices?   When I cut my Porchetta at home. You see the layers of herbs and spices in the slice.  At Porchetta and Co.  The chop the meat so you basically a layer of gray.  Without the splash of colour from my rapini it wouldn't have looked very appetizing.  Another issue is the rapini should've been chopped smaller to make it easier to chew.  The mustard didn't go with it.  And yes, you might think I'm insane since pork goes great with mustard generally.  It just didn't work for me.  I think maybe a pesto aioli would've worked better.  Lastly, the reason you eat Porchetta is for that crunch element of the  crackled skin.  I literally 1 tiny morsel of it.  Now either the ratio of skin vs. meat when they roll it makes it insufficient to have enough crackling for each sandwich or they're just being all around stingy on the cracklings.  Seriously guys if I wanted a roast pork tenderloin sandwich I would've gone somewhere else but I wanted a Porchetta sandwich.  On the other hand their fries were excellent!  Lol!

Service:  it was good and friendly and efficient.  Each order is made fresh even the fries.

I will come back.  This time I'll be a bit more vocal and ask for more crackling and will add more salt."}
{"text":"Excellent. Their signature porchetta sandwich with parmesan and truffle is spot on. Flavour, textures, portion size, and price. Definitely need to try this and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"The fried chicken sandwich is super tender and juicy. One of the best chicken I've had in Toronto! The house special has different flavours bursting in every bite which was fun. The bun is strange as it's very pale/super soft (i thought it'd be more toasted but guess I can ask for them to toast it more next time). The only thing for me was that it was slightly salty and the condiments just tasted normal. Tasted like something I could've put together myself. That's why I'm giving it a 3 star instead of 4."}
{"text":"OMG holy crap are their sandwiches ever tasty!

Got takeout- the House Special and Fried Chicken sandwiches were incredibly good. Not cheap, but well worth it. The mustard and raunch sauces complemented the porchetta and fried chicken extremely well."}
{"text":"A huge sandwich packed with a generous amount of meat and crispy skins! 
Love their buns too (crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside)
I had a porchetta sandwich ($7.25) with tomato sauce (+$0.25) and mushrooms (+$0.95). Mustard and hot sauce are free. 

Quick and friendly service. They have a very spacious seating area too. 
A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Watched an episode with Anthony Bourdain trying the sandwich so had to try it myself. Wasn't expecting much but wow this was an amazing sandwich. I got the recommended toppings and it was made quick.

It is a little pricey but even though it's not the biggest sandwich it's still worth the price to try. Not sure you'd go back often. Probably not a healthy choice. I would say this is my fav sandwich I've tried in Toronto to date."}
{"text":"This place is ad advertised!  Incredible tasting meat!"}
{"text":"Love it! The meat is so juicy and flavourful. I get the house special (?) I think it comes with truffle mayo and hot sauce. I would recommend getting it. Honestly I hate the crackling, it has an overpowering flavour, it's too hard and ruins the overall texture of the sandwich. If it was fried better then it could've added to it. 
Only bar seating and there's maybe 4 spots so It's more of a take-out place. Also, it's Cash Only. I haven't tried the sides or anything else, but I might start the next time I'm in there. 

Honestly, I've never had a porchetta sandwich like this and the price is worth it.

Would I return? Yes, every time the craving hits."}
{"text":"Had extremely high expectations of this place - I tried the house special sandwich with pork, mustard, hot sauce and truffle. It was pretty good! I felt the meat was a bit dry, and not a 'big enough' sandwich for almost $10, but my husband absolutely raved about it, so what do I know?!
You probably won't get a seat, so be prepared to take away.
Apparently they whip up some amazing daily sandwiches (they post them on Instagram) - that may be a reason to return."}
{"text":"Trekked through bitter cold when winter hit Toronto again last weekend for these sandwiches and it was worth.

I got to split 2 sandwiches so I didn't have to make the difficult choice of porchetta or chicken.

The porchetta house special was fantastic.
The crispy skin of the pork and the fatty cracking paired together was great. I usually don't particularly like mustard but the seedy variety that topped this sandwich complemented added a  nice texture and tang to the bun.

I also got to try the daily special, the fried chicken sandwich Parmesan style. 
It was juicy, saucy, cheesy and delicious. This one was also a lot heavier than the porchetta. It was perfect that I had someone to share with, else I probably wouldn't have been able to finished a whole on my own.

I want to try the original fried chicken next but I'll probably order through uber eats instead if it's still this cold."}
{"text":"What do I gotta say that 90 reviews before me have not said.
They really like their truffle oil here; I had this mushroom puree soup with truffle oil and it was truly a truffle decadent soup. It was so salty and so much truffle flavor that it was almost too much.

But well the Porchetta sandwich, a great sandwich that cannot be described and can only be tried."}
{"text":"Directed by Foodies that this is a \"must try\" sandwich joint in Toronto - so a 30 minutes walk in -10 Celsius I had high expectations. 
Food did not disappoint:
House special Porchetta sandwich - meat is juicy and savory. Very tender and good cut. Bun had a nice crispy crunch without being hard. $9. I liked a lot. 
Cole slaw - freshly made, home style. Was talked into ordering this. Glad I did. $4 seems a lot but you get enough for 2 people - packed the extra to go. Goes great with the Porchetta. 
Service - super friendly. Think the server is some kind of cole slaw aficionado. Blogs about cole slaw!
Overall: this place is solid 4.5 Stars. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I went here with Antonia W. and I can confirm the whole arm-barring story. I had first read about this place after reading about it in Eye Weekly so being a pork lover I wanted to check it out. 

Base price for a sandwich $6 but toppings are extra, except for the choice of mustard, of which you have two (dijon and whole grain iirc). Th fat content was fine for me and a necessary evil because the meat was very moist and flavourful. The cruncy bits of pork skin really sets this sandwich apart and add great texture to the sandwich. We ordered mushrooms with it but next time I'll order it with only the mustard because the meat is that good that you don't need any extra toppings.

It is primarily a take out place but it's a sandwich, so no problem there. If I'm in the area I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This little piggy went to Porchetta and Co.
This little piggy ate a sandwich 
And this little piggy went um nom nom nom
All the way home.

Alright I may not be good at generating nursery rhymes, but the service and sandwiches at this outpost is amazing! See those big rolls of porchetta behind the display? They are very bloody hell juicy, and they are calling for you to eat a piece for pork's sakes!

The porchetta sandwiches they serve with the ingredients and sauces they throw into it are an unbelievable wonder in your mouth. They do come up with different limited time specials bearing the signs of genius thinking. One of the sandwiches that I did try was a special that had kimchi (forgot what they called it). It looked hot on their Instagram feed, but even hotter in my mouth; the chunks of kimchi was a touch of juicy spiciness to the already juicy good and savoury porchetta slice.

The King West house is below street level and built for grab-and-go, though there are a small handful of seating available in the small space.

{"text":"With a name like Porcetta & Co. one is going to think this is all about the meat.  How can you go wrong with pig on a bun and all that crackling to boot?  Well it wasn't the pork that brought me and my hunny to P&Co last Saturday afternoon.  It was the soft shell crab sammies.  That's right, read it again.  Soft shell crab sammies being dished up at the pork counter.  

I follow P&Co in Tweetland and they often tweet their daily specials or when they run out of what they've been serving.  I had been meaning for the longest time to hit up this hub nub of a meat spot and when they tweeted last Saturday morning a pic of their Saturday special they had me.  I held up my iPad at my hunny, flashing him a pic of the P&Co food porn and he got this goofy, evil grin. Kinda like when the Grinch ripped off Whoville.  An hour later we were on the road, heading in to the city to finally get our maws filled at P&Co.   

I've eaten my share of crustacean sammies up and down the eastern seaboard and I have some high expectations. Let me tell you, P&Co didn't disappoint.  They use soft, long buns, similar to a hot dog bun, only with a bit more body and texture.  It came stuffed with fresh, hot, crispy deep fried soft shell crab, topped with some sort of finely shredded lettuce condiments, a drizzle of dressing and crowned with crumbled bacon bits.  Pricy?  At $9.95 it wasn't a cheap sammie but worth every single penny because the crab was absolutely fantastic.  It pulled apart beautifully.  It wasn't rubbery or chewy as overcooked or unfresh shelled seafood can be.  This was just plain old food poetry in motion.  

Not sure how long the Saturday Soft Shell Crab sammies will be around on Dundas Street.  I suspect as long as the proprietor can get these tasty crustaceans they'll be a Saturday staple.  My suggestion would be to haul ass down there next weekend and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Also ate it quick, no photo!
Great porchetta sandwich.  Location is small/tight, not a bad suggestion to go at OFF PEAK times for better experience. 
Different strokes; I didn't love the 'crackling' part.  Someone else will tell u the 'crackling' part is the BEST part...  I don't care if he/she likes crackling and thinks I'm LOST for not appreciating it.
I still don't like crackling."}
{"text":"The sandwich is good.  With extra crackle.  Take out the crackle and it would taste like pulled pork without the bbq sauce.    Its all about the crackle. The mustard is good.  Bread is good.  Extra crackle is the way to go.  Get extra crackle!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken burger that was the most popular in chicken burger series. It was decent but nothing spectacular. Chicken piece was large with big piece of cheese. But not much vegetable."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best sandwich one will find in the 416.  Delicious crackling, amazing porchetta, great choice of cheeses and toppings and the daily specials I think are what put this place on another level. 

They understand how to make a deep fried chicken that is just decadent, and will complement it with all sorts of different accompaniments that are absolutely perfect.  I am somewhat glad we only found this place with about a month and a half left in our stint in Toronto because otherwise I may have found a weight problem.  

Also the cherry cola they serve is the best I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"A group of us came across this hole-in-the-wall completely by accident following a successful softball game at Trinity-Bellwoods Park. There was a dozen of us, with significant appetites which Porchetta & Co. sated. A short, simple, yet delicious menu adorns the wall with a single daily special that rotates. Our group was served in good time even considering the place was packed when we arrived. The sandwich is homey, fresh, and delightful to bite into. I've been multiple times and always been pleased."}
{"text":"It was another branch of Porchetta apart from their Dundas street locations. I know this place from one TV show of Anthony Bourdain. So I thought it should be an awesome place. But honestly, I expected too much. Their special porchetta sandwich was good, cripy bread outside, tender meat with mustard,a little parmesan and truffle mayo inside, and added some pieces of crunchy fried pork fat. The best thing is the sandwich was not greasy at all even though there were lots of fat inside but not very impressed. Maybe it need more flavour and reduced some fat because it looks a little frightened. The staff were all very nice and friendly, the decoration of this little place makes people feel very warm and comfortable."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times in the past two weeks, and I have no complaints.  Loved the food every time.
The O.G. chicken sandwich is spicy and delicious.  Also loved the grilled cheese, with porchetta and goat cheese.  The kale caesar was also good, albeit a bit too saucy with dressing.  Their fries taste fresh and actually like potatoes for once.

Service is super fast, and prices are a great value.  One sandwich is usually very filling for me.
King St. location has a good amount of seating, even a few seats outside."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Thats all I can say. The only thing that got annoying were the crispy bits, kinda ruined it for me (personal preference). 
Also had the soup of the day which was mushroom/truffle. Was very tasty as well. 

Love sandwiches, love pork? Come here."}
{"text":"Was brought to Porchetta with a food tour.  Not sure that I would have necessarily found it on my own.  

Prior to entering the restaurant, we were given the details on how they prepare the pork for their  \"House Special\" sandwich.  Basically how the preparation for the pork started 3 days previous, and how its slow cooked with bacon.  Also how the buns are specially made only for Porchetta.  

As part of the tour we were given only 1/2 a sandwich.  Oh Wow !  the pork melts in your mouth.  The bun is crisp enough to hold the sandwich together but soft enough that it's complimentary to the melt in your mouth pork.  And of course fabulous flavours !  

I'm definitely coming back !  I need to try a full sandwich along with some fries."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you would pass by in a second if you didn't already know where it is.  I mean, the whole store front is as big as 2 TTC booths in the subway.  Saying that, it always seems to be rammed... hmmmm... interesting.

Speaking of that... there is probably a total of 4 stools in the place and they're all on the wall/window (hah, to the window, to the wall).  It gets pretty packed in there and I can't imaging ordering a soup and having nowhere to eat it.  Kinda sucks that way.

The menu is drop dead simple.  Sandwich of Porchetta or plate of it?  What toppings did you want on it?  Done.  From reading some of the earlier reviews, I ordered one plain, straight up to see how this bad boy would taste.  From there they would weigh the meat and then put it on a a fresh bun.

First of all, the bun was amazing.  Crusty, but not so crusty that it cut your mouth; but still soft, chewy with a bit of olive oil on it.  Between that was the Porchetta.  Let me explain what porchetta is (according to the website).  It's pork shoulder, wrapped in procuitto, wrapped in pork belly.  Yup... amazing.  Then, they take the skin on the pork belly and crumble it on top like croutons (if croutons were amazing this is what they'd be).

I actually found the sandwich kinda dry.  The problem I think is that they cut the porchetta into a little \"serving dish\" before and then pick some of it out to weigh when you order a sandwich.  Mine probably didn't have enough fat or something.  Don't get me wrong, I had a couple of bites that were just amazing, but it wasn't exactly every bite.  I kinda had to give in and slather it with a bit of mustard to moisten it a tiny bit.

All in all, give this place a try.  I was pleasantly surprised when I came here.  

PS. there are no bathrooms... so... yah."}
{"text":"yum! Loved the porchetta sandwich and the crispy chicken sandwiches. The crispy pork instead the porchetta was a good addition. The sandwich did look small when I first got it, but it did fill me up. The sides were also a bit small. Overall it tasted great"}
{"text":"Love this place, what can I say.  My go-to order is a porchetta sandwich with rapini, truffle sauce, grainy mustard, and hot sauce.  Extra cracklins' please!  And a side of their roasted potatoes.  Can't go wrong with it, a solid choice every time.

On weekends they offer daily special sandwiches, some which sounded fantastic, like the calamari sandwich, but I've never been fortunate enough to be there on a day where they are offered.

Just wish they would do a better job cleaning the \"gelatinous\" fat from some pieces of the meat.  SOME is okay, but too much is a bummer."}
{"text":"Best pork sandwich in Toronto... crackling in there is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Porchetta and Co... I've tried the Signature Porchetta sandwich, the fried chicken, and their Poutine. 

The Porchetta is very flavorful and not dry. The meat is then topped with a grainy mustard and truffle sauce. AMAZING. You can also ask for extra crackle (pure fat) which I don't do. The Fried Chicken is pretty tasty with Buffalo Sauce. 

Overall, I have always enjoyed my sandwiches - I'm excited they are opening another location in the path. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Gawd Dang!  This is the best sangwich in the city!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend of mine and I ordered the OG chicken sandwich and my friend got the chicken parmesan with a poutine on the side. The sandwiches there really delicious, the chicken was crispy and flavorful while the bun was a bit thick and not your normal sandwich bun. It was a bit harder to bite but added to the flavour. The poutine tasted good the first couple of bites but near the end the amount of pork was a bit overwhelming.

Overall a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"THE SANDWICH
I had the porchetta sandwich with rapini (for an extra 75 cents). The pork was incredibly tender and juicy. It had the perfect amount of fat to it, which added such a wonderful flavour, as fat usually does. I liked the bits of fried belly that they threw in there. It added variety to the texture. The rapini was cooked just right - bright green and crunchy. Nothing worse than soggy, overcooked greens, wouldn't you say? The combo of fatty pork and rapini was just right! I appreciated the freshness against the more heavy flavour/feel of the pork. 

My friend topped her sandwich with tomato sauce and truffle sauce and loved it. She said it was like having a nice rose sauce.

There are two types of Kozliks mustards for you to put on your sandwich/meat plate. And boy, they really picked two excellent Kozliks mustards! One was pretty potent and hot; the other was all whole-grains and less pungent. Both were excellent on my sandwich

THE SIDE OF ROASTED POTATO
Great potatoes! Some of the best I've had! They were very simple, but the texture was just right. Add a bit of mustard to that and you've got a great side for your sandwich/meat plate. Oh, and it's a good one to share with one other person!

SEATING
There are six stools in the joint, two by one wall and four by the front window. They are not comfortable stools, but will do if you are just in there for a quick, quick bite.

KITCHEN
looks very clean. Makes the experience even more enjoyable. 

SERVICE/STAFF
Friendly staff! I asked them if they were tired of pork yet and they each had something to say about their relationship with the Porchetta pork (which was that they have one every shift, even after seven months of working there...and when they aren't working, they are thinking about the pork). When I went in with my two friends, there weren't other people, so the staff had time to chat with us. 

IF YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE MEAT...
You can buy the pork by the half pound or the pound. I asked about it and they say they *pack* the container fulla meat for you. They will also add the crispy pork belly bits for no extra cost.

Excellent little joint. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The best sandwich in Toronto, at least IMHO.

There is just the right amount of tender pork, fat and crunchy crackling to form what most scientists call 'an amalgam of awesome'. The sourdough bun from Caldense Bakery across the street is great too. Lightly toasted, the crisp exterior helps hold everything in place.

Of the available toppings, the rapini is best, because then you can lie to yourself and say \"What? I'm eating healthy.\"

But generally, there's just something very cool about the ethos of Porchetta & Co. They focus mainly on one thing and do it really well, and as a result are able to offer it at reasonable prices. What's more, unlike a lot of 'gourmet', 'foodie' places, the staff are super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Prices for food are good and service is fast. 

I find the meat to be a little too dry and often cold. Everything seems to lack flavour for me. It's a good place to go if you're in a rush for a meal but nothing special."}
{"text":"Wow, their sandwiches here are really good, especially the House Special.

The Pork Sandwich was nice, juicy & tender. The chicken sandwich was good too but I liked the pork Sandwich more. 

Order the sweet potato fries for your side. Perfectly seasoned and not soggy. 

The sandwiches are quite big so you're sure to leave full. 

The place is small. There's only about 3 tables and 1 communal table but people seem to come in and out quick. 

If it's your first time here, go for anything pork since they specialize in that. You'll definitely enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Porchetta is delicious. The location on Dundas is a great spot for a quick Porchetta sandwich. Here's what you need to know:

Sandwich: Delicious, yet a bit salty. 

Sauce: tangy

Side Item must: Cole slaw

Daily special: Not always, yet chicken and pastrami sandwich specials have proven delicious.

Credit Cards: No

Seating for one of two: Maybe

Seating for a group: No

Drinks: Bottled water, canned pop"}
{"text":"It's alright.  If you've never had porchetta before, then it's a decent option and relatively well-located.

However, I've found quality varies quite a bit.  Sometimes, I'll get that right  balance of lean and fat and a good amount of crackling.  Other times, it will taste fatty and limp.  I don't think the bread they use here is particularly good - seems too dry.  It's a shame that something so often overlooked can ruin a sandwich.

The mustard is free but I'm not a huge fan of the nickel-and-dime toppings system.  As wonderful and simple as pork on bread can be - one of my favourite porchetta joints in Vancouver used to have salsa verde to help cut through the fat.  Think having another free sauce option would help resuscitate the sometimes fatty pork.  The topping at extra cost just seem odd to me -- cheese? truffle? ... on porchetta?  Also, I realize that hot sauce is free -- but it just seems sacrilegious to me.

The last time I was here - it was busy as hell.  And the fried chicken sandwich special they had looked much better than my porchetta sandwich.  So, don't skip over the specials.  And recently, they offered a soft shell crab sandwich (which was sold out).  Odd, but I actually think the '& Co' portion of their name is better than their porchetta."}
{"text":"FINALLY.  After so many years (well, it seemed like many years), i finally got to got o Porchetta & Co. to get some delicious food.  I went on a Saturday with my friend because I kept on talking about getting porchetta after the TFC game.  Soft-shell Saturdays were back.

I was standing in line with my friend debating if I should get the porchetta or the soft-shell crab.  Hardest decision of my life.  I called up my friend who goes to Porchetta & Co. probably every single week, and he suggested to me to get the \"Gang Bang.\" O_O  Yup.  It's the soft-shell crab with added porchetta on top.

Messy? Yes. Delicious? OH HELLS YEAH. It's a bit on the expensive side, but c'mon - soft-shell crab AND porchetta.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Mmmmm pork CRACKling! If your into juicy pork sandwiches with lots of flavour then this is your spot! 

This place has limited seats (less than 10) but there's a nice bench outside to enjoy your sandwich during the summertime. 

My boyfriend and I came her for their soft shell crab po boy and their traditional Porchetta sandwich. The soft shell crab Po Boy was soo crispy and light we literally inhaled it in a matter of seconds! I didn't expect much from the classic sandwich but then I took a bite and WOW! Instant fave! It was juicy and flavourful but that star of the show for me was the crackling!! It was soo good we had to line up twice and reorder another soft shell crab and porchetta sandwich! This is definitely one of my fav spots! There's additional charge for topping except for mustard and hot sauce but I only put a little, I didn't want to compromise the flavour of both sandwich."}
{"text":"It's A-OK, but I'm a fan because the choices of where to go for a porchetta sandwich are this place and the other place at SLM. It's not the succulent, herbaceous, slightly salty crusted porchetta you had in Italy, but it does the job. Had the sandwich w/ truffle sauce and grainy mustard and a side of rapini to help move things along and the combo made for a tasty and satisfying dinner. I'll have to go back to try the breakfast sammie cuz porchetta, eggs and cheese sound pretty good together."}
{"text":"Best ever.
Omg I don't think I've ever went through a week without craving their porchetta... 
Definitely would recommend the Big Mac too whenever its on special!

Now all I need is for them to partner up with UberEats and we'll be good to go"}
{"text":"You have not been here, you have to check them out! Recently my friend introduced me to this pork sandwich restaurant and cannot believe I have been missing out this whole time. We tried the House Special with truffle sauce, parmesan, mustard and hot sauce. Also, the special with deep fried chicken which was personally favourite. Lastly, the poutine and supreme fries were perfect complements to the mouth watering sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had the pork sandwich and pork plate with roasted potato.  Had choice of hot sauce and 2 types of mustard on sandwich, I did not get any additional toppings. The pork was nice and tender but the sandwich was a bit dry.

Price was fairly decent - $5.75 for sandwich and $8.95 for the plate.  Joint accepts cash only.  There are only about 5 seats but a nice spot for people watch out the window.

Would come back if I have cravings for roasted pork"}
{"text":"Jazzed up sandwiches that are satisfying and delicious! Located in the heart of King West, just east of King Street W and Portland Street (not too far away from Lee, Wvrst, Portland Variety, etc), we visited on a Thursday evening and it looks like this is a pretty popular spot. Ordering is as follows: you grab a menu, figure out what you want, order at the front, and then grab a table. This location seats about 15 to 18 ish people (approximately), so there's a reasonable amount of seating, but not too much. They'll call you up once your order is ready.

We ordered the day's special, which was the Big Mac Fried Chicken Sandwich and the parmesan chicken sandwich. Both were on soft and chewy buns, with generous sauces, and contained very well-seasoned meats. I'm a lover of all things fried, so the Big Mac Fried Chicken Sandwich was a favourite of mine. Very flavourful, and super crispy. The sandwiches themselves were a decent size - not overly large, but big enough that you won't be hungry after.

This spot is very casual with a rustic, yet diner-esque vibe. Great spot to grab a quick and laid-back meal. With drinks, for two people, we paid around $26.00."}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Today we are trying out the Porchetta house special complimented by their P&Co poutine. Let's dive right into the review.

Wow does this sandwich look amazing! I was so excited to eat it I forgot to even take a photo :( sadness. Mmmm, the soft squishy bun, juicy flavour of the meat and the crunchiness of the crackling all fit perfect together to form this sandwich. The poutine was good, but it was a bit cold and slightly soggy. I did order this from Foodora however so that is to be expected as the delivery time was around 20 minutes. Some of my coworkers ordered the chicken sandwich and dayummm that sandwich looked so good too. I am definitely going to give that a try next time!

The sandwich itself is a whopping $9 while the poutine which wasn't very big was around $7. Although this is no small price to pay, I would gladly still order this as my meal was quite satisfying as it would be the amount I'd pay at a restaurant anyways. If you not full, just eat a banana or something to help counter all the fries and fried pork you just ate ;)

All in all, I had a fantastic experience. The price may be a bit steep for some, but I will definitely visit again to try the chicken sandwich. That's it for today's episode of javing it Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here. They are so tasty. I usually get the plate with garlic rapini and house special sandwich. Soooo delicious.  It's not a big place but there are some tables you can sit at. Good place to grab a quick bite, otherwise take out is a great option too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I can say, hands down, that Porchetta and Co.'s serves one of the best pork sandwiches ever. 

The pork meat is succulent and flavourful. Each bite is different: from soft and moist meat to crunchy crackling. I don't mind if I bite into a piece of fat. It's meat that's been marinated for 24 hours so that the piece of fat is full of flavour. 

You can get different toppings to go with your pork sandwich like mozzarella, rappini, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and the decadently flavourful, truffle sauce. They range from $0.25 to $0.75. Get the truffle sauce with your sandwich, it is to die for.

As for the sides, you can try their rappini or roasted potatoes but get the soup, especially if it's the Porchetta special. This medley includes porchetta bits, bacon, prosciutto, white kidney beans, rappini, potato and truffle sauce. It's dense, heavy and absolutely delicious. But save it for last, otherwise you won't have room to finish your sandwich. 

Things to keep in mind: 
- It's cash only
- Limited seating (5 stools in total)
- The staff is awesome
- You leave Porchetta's smelling like meat"}
{"text":"I've been to Porchetta a few times now and am usually pretty happy with my food. Sometimes its a hit or miss, but even when its not the best, its still decent.

The best thing I have had from porchetta was when they did the softshell crab sandwich. Unfortunately because this is a seasonal item its not there all the time.

I like to get the sandwich pretty basic with just hot sauce and both kinds of mustard as some of the toppings can be pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing food! House special was delicious.. A little too small for me but fantastic nontheless"}
{"text":"You almost miss it riding by on Dundas, but make sure you check this tiny little sandwich shop out! Somehow the special crispy chicken sandwich out shined the signature pork one!"}
{"text":"Tried the sandwich, beans and coleslaw. The sandwich was crazy good. Coleslaw was nice - vinegar/oil based and not too creamy. I wasn't a huge fan of the beans as it tasted more like a bean stew instead of the classic baked beans. They were tasty but just not what I expected. Would definitely return for the sandwich though!"}
{"text":"Porchetta is the latest addition to the pork craze. Although it seems like a simple concept; roasted pork between two pieces of bread is quite difficult in my opinion because since there aren't that many ingredient, there is more emphasis  on details and execution. So, how did Porchetta & Co. score? I would have to say minimal at best. Don't, get me wrong, I did like the sandwich, but I believe there is room for improvement. 

The roasted pork was decent but it was missing that wow factor to propel it above average. I would have liked the pork to not be as precise on the cut and portion. It was a bit unappealing when I saw the person preparing my sandwich portion the serving on a scale. I understand there is a concern for the bottom line but does using a scale vs. eye balling the portion make that big of the difference? Please remove the scale, I beg you. 

I think the price point is good but I wouldn't have mind paying for a larger sandwich as I was still hungry after finishing. The crispy pork cracklings was a nice touch, it provided a contrast in texture. The ciabatta bread was a good choice in keeping the pork in place but still being soft enough to bite through. The complimentary hot sauce was a nice option for those who like a kick, but I recommend not adding too much as it will drown the taste of the pork which should be the star. There are other toppings offered  but at a price.

I think a few tweaks here and there, this place could be a huge hit."}
{"text":"I literally dream about this sandwich. It was everything. Porchetta is not that common to find and trust me it is worth the trip! They were cash only or didn't take our american cards for some reason, so we went down the street to pull out cash and it was so worth it. grab sandwiches and bop over to the park to eat them."}
{"text":"I tried this place due to my friend's recommendation. We came for a dessert sandwich after dinner. Alright, maybe I should reword that and say I am a fatty and wanted more food after dinner and justified it by calling it dessert.

Staff: We took it to go since we had friends waiting. There was a bit of confusion as to who was taking our order since no one was at the register. The kitchen staff had looked at us when we walked in but we just stood there waiting for someone to take our order. Eventually it all got sorted out and we got our sandwich really quick.

Ambience: It is a small place with some stools available to sit and eat. You can also see the meats sitting there while you wait. Other than that I would say there's not much else to note.

Food: We had the house special sans the Mustard and Hot Sauce. The meat was so juice and the truffle sauce was delicious. Everything just melted in your mouth except for the bun. In fact, I would say the bun is the biggest downfall of the sandwich since it was very dry and hard. Maybe it would have been softer if I hadn't asked to hold the mustard and hot sauce, but I just don't like either them in my sandwiches. 

I was wavering on the score and I think it'd be closer to a 3.5 stars. The meat and truffle sauce were great, if only they could get a softer bun. Although I don't see myself ever craving this sandwich in the near future, I'm willing to come back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is pretty awesome for a porchetta sandwich! The staff was super nice and helpful with everything I needed. 

I got their house sandwich and it was totally the way to go. The pork was tender and juice with a nice kick in the sauce!"}
{"text":"Porchetta + crackling + truffle sauce + Parmesan + hot sauce + grainy mustard + freshly toasted bread = HOUSE SPECIAL = Absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy coming to Porchetta & Co. Sandwiches, sides, and beer are what you can get here. I've had the house special twice and it's tasty. The bread is toasted nicely, generous portions of meat and the mustard and hot sauce go great together. They also carry a couple craft beers. Seating is limited but lots of folks grab a sandwich and go here. 

I'd come back if I'm looking for a quick eat."}
{"text":"i was expecting more...
-there wasnt that much meat in the sandwich. it was like a \"sandwich-lite\". for 5.95 before tax for a bun and some meat, i expected it to be packed full of meat.
-the meat itself was kind of bland. i didnt really get a sense of any seasoning that it was supposedly marinated in. if you're going to weigh the meat out as if its some precious commodity, it better be the bomb! it wasnt.
-i had it with mushrooms and asked for hot sauce (tabasco), but when i went to eat it, i had to actually open it up to make sure the shrooms made it in. not sure if they forgot the tabasco or what? once again, bland.

overall, i wasnt particularly impressed, and would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I hate to write reviews like this, but I just received the shittiest service at this place. Drugged out cashier was staring at the blue jays game. When I got his attention and placed my order, there's was almost zero response from him. I asked for credit and he didn't even prep the machine. And once I gave it back to him I asked for a receipt and he just walked away. Not a word. 

He came back with a supervisor who looked for minutes figuring out how to print a customer receipt. It's not like they made any other transactions since mine. 

They eventually gave me a crumbled up receipt from the garbage that wasn't even the same amount. The next customer after me also told the cashier to fuck off because he waited a long time to get an order and they didn't even acknowledge him. 

0 stars.

But they had me at pig crackling so I probably will return for more. Who could resist delicious crackling?"}
{"text":"This was an unplanned visit but I'm certainly happy to come across this little restaurant during my travel in Toronto!

Check out my experience on video https://youtu.be/ZudAR5ETwB4

There was a line forming as we got there close to lunch time (but it moves quickly) and the restaurant is small (probably seatings for 20 inside). The menu is short and simple but my mission was to get the PORCHETTA!!! 

We ordered the porchetta plate with poutine (paid $2 extra), chicken parmesan sandwich, a side of rapini (greens) and the truffle sauce. The food came out within 5-10 minutes, pretty efficient service and we snagged seatings at the counter near the restroom.

Poutine was doused with shredded cheese (melted), gravy and the crunchy skin (cracklings) from the porchetta.. yummmm!!! It was on the salty side but it was sooo good! I wish the portion was bigger! The porchetta was perfectly seasoned, savory, but the meat was not too fatty so I didn't feel too guilty eating it.. It felt a bit heavy though, perhaps a side of steam rice would have been a nice option to soak the flavors from the pork.. yummmm!

The chicken parmesan sandwich was amazingly good!!! The fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy in the inside despite the meat was \"white meat.\" The red sauce was not overpowering, a great pairing with the fried chicken. 

Rapini was perfectly cooked..but a bit bitter (well, expected!). It's also on the salty side, though. 

The truffle sauce was forgettable.. and a bit too salty and sour for my liking. We didn't really need it as a condiment actually.

We spent around $30 CAD for our meal (before tips), it was not cheap but again, the food was on the heavy side. If you want to try porchetta, certainly check out this place :)"}
{"text":"Place is very small which is not recommended for big group. Good for take out.

Love the meat sandwich with crackling.  Tried the rice ball and its ok. There are variety of special pop drinks."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the Porchetta sandwich since I read so many amazing reviews and all the pictures I saw of the sandwich looked so juicy.

What a disappointment! I read that the pork went through some 24 hour process so I expected something amazing. What did I get instead? Chinese roast pork! I enjoy Chinese roast pork but I didn't expect the Porchetta sandwich to taste exactly like something I grew up eating.

Also, contrary to the many pictures of the sandwich, the sandwich was not juicy at all. It was almost unbearably dry.

So, if you like this place for the meat, just go to Chinatown and get a take out box of Chinese roast pork for $8 or less."}
{"text":"Great staff. Chill spot. Savory sandwiches? Crack on the go!

Get the special w/ the cracked truffle sauce, mustard, hot sauce... So god damn good! You definitely taste the flavor of the truffle and the porchetta was mind-blowing! That touch of crispy pork skin adds that kick & makes this sandwich what it is.

De. Lish. Ous!!!"}
{"text":"I used to visit Toronto and tried and failed many times to check out this place. I finally got to it and was soooo glad I did. The porchetta sandwich with the truffle sauce was amazing! Moist and delicious with a lovely crunch from the cracklings (I could have used more of those!). The pork had just the right amount of seasoning and the bun was soft and fresh. 

Mmmmmm pork....
It's three am and writing this review is making me want to go get some now. If only they were open this late!"}
{"text":"This place was OK. I enjoyed the actual bread more than anything, so light and crispy. I wouldn't go out of my way just to come here though. There are so many better options and things to eat especially considering the prices."}
{"text":"I've been to Porchetta & Co a few times for the regular sandwich (artisanal bun, porchetta, crackling, mustard and hot sauce) and it was quite enjoyable. The highlight for me had been the crispy delicious crackling, and the great artisanal bun. Today I tried the breakfast sandwich (porchetta, crackling, fried egg and smoked gouda, on that same delicious bun) and my eyes really lit up. That is one fantastic breakfast sandwich, and the oozing egg, and melted cheese, is completely what that sandwich was missing. Porchetta & Co has found a perfect marriage. At a cost of $6.45 for the sandwich, it's the same price as the regular, and probably is one of the best bites for the price in the city. Also, the fact that the sandwich is only available on Saturdays between 11:30am and 3:00pm makes it even specialer. Oh, and don't forget the hot sauce! To be honest, I was tempted to not write this post because I didn't want the lineup for this sandwich to get any bigger."}
{"text":"My son and I both had the house sandwich.  Great pork and the crackling was so good ... the texture and the taste.  I liked the toppings it came with and even  added a little more hot sauce .  We need to go back and try the grilled cheese which comes with pork of course.

Their licensed too so we got chase it down with a beer.  Limited selection (3 beers, a  of radlers and ciders.   we tried the local craft pilsener.  I think it was called Ace.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Here piggy, piggy, piggy \"git in mah belleh!\" to quote Mike Myers from Austin Powers is how I feel every time I step into this place.  I first tried their wonderful pork sammy's when they started gracing us at the Toronto Beerfest and I've been hooked ever since.  I just tried their fried chicken sandwich too and I've gotta say it was a solid performance.  Bravo Porchetta & Co!"}
{"text":"Why didn't I think of this.... Chinese crispy roasted pork on a bun.  Porcetta is pricey for what it is but well worth it in my opinion.  They know what they are doing when they assemble your sandwich, with each sandwich you get the perfect combination of crispy pork skin and meat.  Their side toppings are all great additions to the sanwich, I had homemade mustard and some greens (rappini) which went really well with the pork.  The bun was nice and fresh.  The sandwich was on the smaller side as it didn't fill me.  Service was not great, there was no greeting as I entered.  I would still recommend Porchetta just based on the taste alone.  It's definitely worth it if you love roasted pork."}
{"text":"Hot sandwich, cold service.  Small hipster joints glorified by  Bourdain's Layover.  For now, celebrity status seemed to have gone to their heads. I dropped in last Friday's rainy afternoon.  Very small space, I walked in, probably smelling of out-of-town tourist, girl at counter and about three others behind her milling about. They all ignored me and pretend I wasn't there. Granted I was eye balling the overhead menu, but still - she didn't acknowledge me until I stepped up, in her face and said I like to order...  Sandwich was great, small and expensive. $10 with pork loin, cracklings and one side. Bun was extra-WTF?!"}
{"text":"The sandwich here is pretty good. The special with all the fixings is the way to go. Though I think theres too much mustard for me and not enough of their house sauce. The best part is the crackling. It just makes it that much better. 

Service is friendly and quick. They didn't hesitate to explain how the menu works and the sandwiches. Its a pretty tiny place inside, so its good for a quick bite. Don't loiter so that others can get seats as well."}
{"text":"Had the house special Porchetta sandwich....hard to ask for a better sandwich....purists might snub all the toppings, but their loss.  The hot sauce is outstanding...I wish they sold it by the bottle.  They even manage to do the truffle sauce justice.  Normally I avoid anything with truffle flavour because it just ends up tasting nasty, but this was subtle and spot on.  The bun is amazing too.  Quick service and nice location.  Warning though...not too many seats in this location...get there early.

My gold standard for sandwiches is Meat & Bread in Vancouver...and this place is right up there!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing sandwich. So simple yet so delicious. Mustard and truffle sauce is all you need. The bread was very very fresh and fragrant, even though I came by 20 minutes before close. Even though it was the last 30 minutes before closing the lady on the counter was very pleasant. 
Also the price seemed really fair to me."}
{"text":"The hype is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular and has a lot of hype going for it right now.

When I had the house special which is 4oz of porchetta (a boneless pork roast of italian tradition that's fatty, savoury and moist) with truffle sauce, mustard sauce and hot sauce. There were several things that went wrong for me. The porchetta was dry, it was objectively dry and my friends agreed that it's not the best sandwich they've had here. 

Also I didn't find the combination of sauces appealing. You have 3 strongly flavoured sauces together in one sandwich, it had this odd taste to me that I didn't resonate with. Next time I think I'm going to try a simpler sandwich. I'm not a big fan of hot sauce but I thought I would give it a shot.

I'm willing to try this place again. Maybe it was just an off day for them."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Fresh and tasty sandwiches 
- Friendly staff
- Fried chicken sandwich. Sums it up

Cons:
- Price is a bit steep for just a sandwich

Ordered:
$9.45 Fried Chicken Sandwich - Who doesn't like a fried chicken sammich?

Conclusion:
Fried chicken sandwich fan over here. Well, fried chicken in general. Arrived here for lunch at around 1pm. It was pretty dead so the service and quick. I'd recommend coming in around that time to avoid the lunch rush. Staff was friendly and the place was clean for the most part. 

Overall I'm happy with my sandwich. The chicken was light, crispy and flavourful, bun was soft and not overly toasted or buttery and the hot sauce gives the sandwich a nice kick. My only and main negative about coming here is price of a sandwich alone. $10 just seems a bit steep for my liking. I left feeling hungry and wanting to get something else. But then again, I'm a pig. I'd recommend Porchetta."}
{"text":"Not your traditional Italian bakery on a Saturday afternoon style porchetta sandwich, but it has it's place. The pork is tender, well-seasoned, and has perfect crackling. It's not really the oversized pork-filled Italian bun that comes to my mind when someone says porchetta sandwich, but this contemporary rendition of a classic was delicious. The real star of the show was the fried chicken sandwich. I think it only gets served a few days a week and constantly has a changing thematic. I would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"VIBE 
This tiny Italian sandwich spot is one of the best things to happen to the gentrification of Dundas West and for good reason: their sandwiches are delicious! Though many a hipster may pop in, I see a lot of foodies and local restaurant owners get their fix on the regular. Though there are few stools, they're really comfortable (they have a bit of a back to them) and face the window, obligatory for people watching. In the summer, I highly recommend taking the sandwich to Trinity Bellwoods Park for more people watching; a perfect Toronto afternoon.  It is one of my top ten favourite eats in the  city.

I EAT/ATE 
It's usually one thing and one thing only you can get here (porchetta sandwiches wrapped in prosciutto; their website is pretty detailed on what you can get) and they are at the top of their game. I love the crackling crunchy bits. On another note, their soup is gourmet: I've had mushroom truffle soup and peaches and cream corn soup - both worthy of repeat visits. In the summertime, they also add soft shell crab into the mix. Amazing. Average cost for sandwich and pop with a few fixings: $15. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
Porchetta & Co is the stuff sandwich dreams are made of. With a dash of truffle oil."}
{"text":"Best porchetta sandwiches I have ever had. Their fried chicken  sandwich specials are also great. Kind of wish they offered a non chicken sandwich special sometimes though."}
{"text":"This sandwich does not hold a candle to the best porchetta sandwich I have ever had (see: Roli Roti here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/roli-roti-gourmet-rotisserie-san-francisco#hrid:uT1PKxMUU5R2GC0nJG3dQw) and that's unfortunate for Porchetta & Co.  If I hadn't eaten Roli Roti within 15 days of eating here I might have enjoyed myself more*.  I just don't think this is a 5 star sandwich, and Toronto rates it high because it's our only porchetta option. That doesn't make it infallible. This is really a 3 star sandwich but you know what... - 1 for the hype**. 

The good:
- The Porchetta here is okay, but it isn't as flavourful as other porchetta.  Others have noted the meat was a bit bland and I agree.
- The sandwich is reasonably priced (but comes with no toppings - they're extra)

The not-as-good-as-roli-roti-in-detail-and-how-to-improve:
- The bun here was way too big for the sandwich, and IMO not the correct bun for this type of sandwich (while notably still a delicious bun). There was at least 1.5cm of bun around the ENTIRE sandwich that didn't contain porchetta. I would also use a more hardy bun for this type of sandwich as it deteriorated while I was eating. This bun is best used for cold sandwiches (imagine a turkey BLT on it... omg).
- At Roli Roti, they use the bun to sop up the meat juice from the cutting board as they slice the cooked porchetta. P&C should take note of this practice.
- At Roli Roti. the sandwich is more expensive ($8) but it comes with greens and a caramelized onion compote of some sort that brings it to the next level.

The bad:
- I just have to say it: I hate how they weigh the meat for the sandwich.
- It seemed like they were pretty skimpy on the meat (bun size may play into this perception).
- Hardly any seating

In summary, I would eat here again if I were serendipitously in the area and looking for a sandwich, but I would never take the street car across town again specifically to eat here again.

{"text":"Food: 3/5 

Having only tried porchetta from two places this one is smaller and the sauces are way too strong. I'm from Vancouver so the Meat and Bread's porchetta in Vancouver is a lot better 

Price: 2.5/5 
Pricey for it's size

Service: 4/5 
The staff are quite attentive and helpful"}
{"text":"Porchette & Co. induces what I call the full Moon Effect.  At least once a month (slowly moving to a bi-weekly schedule)  I turn into a ravenous werewolf with an insatiable urge for crispy pork flesh!

I bike down to Dundas with purpose, suck back the drool, step in and politely ask for my sandwich accompanied with truffle sauce and dijon mustard.  In the meantime,  I feel for any growth on my incisors and resist the temptation to bite the person next to me. 

Once I get my fix I'll slowly make my way home in contentment all the while anticipating the next full moon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and had big expectations going in! I convinced my father to come here for lunch on his birthday (there were four of us in total) and for four sandwiches, two beer and one bottle of water it was $65!!! The buns are fantastic, nice and fresh...it's the lack of meat between the buns that I was hugely disappointed with. The sandwiches were also lacking in flavour so I was thankful for the hot sauce on the tables.  I have no problem paying $10 for a sandwich if it blows me away and fills me up.  After we left Porchetta we were all still hungry so we went and had appetizers elsewhere :("}
{"text":"Ordered the House Special. Great bun, good amount of mustard although I do find it a bit unequally spread. It's more on one side and drier with no sauce on the other. Crunchy pork with a bit of fat. Some people will like that, I like mine drier. Overall, good choice if you're craving for something meaty but not a burger. I will try the fried chicken next time. My coworker claimed it to be the best fried chicken sandwich she's ever had."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Vegetarians, don't even bother. Pretty sure your options are pig sandwich or chicken sandwich. Some of their sides may be vegetarian-friendly, like the potatoes or rapini. I don't think salad is even an option here. 

The porchetta sandwich is delicious. Meaty with crackling to give it some crunch. The flavour is always really rich. I usually get the house special and am never disappointed. At their other location, I've gotten a sandwich full of gross fat before, but never at this location, thankfully. I've always had a good portion of meat. 

Sometimes I'll get the fried chicken sandwich. Sometimes it's Caesar, sometimes it's spicy or something different. Very delicious too. 

The buns are very good. Sourdough I think? Excellent texture. 

For sides, I love the beans. This location makes the rapini way too salty that it's not enjoyable. That's my only complaint about this location. The other location seems to do the rapini right, though, but fail on the porchetta occasionally, so this is my preferred location. The beans, however, are delicious. My fave is to get the porchetta house special and a side of beans. 

The service at this location is much faster than the Dundas one. 

When you need something comforting and flavourful and you aren't trying to watch your figure or stave off a heart attack, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"There are few smells in the world that can cause such conflicting feelings within me like those that come from roasting pork. Upon stepping into the shoebox that is Porchetta & Co on a scorcher of an afternoon, I was immediately enveloped by the aroma and struck with both thoughts of suffocation and desire.

Within minutes, my sandwich sharing companion and I managed to agree on toppings (truffle sauce, mushrooms, mustard, and a teeny bit of hot sauce), before plopping ourselves down at the store front window stools. Our sandwich was ready shortly after and proved to be juicy, interestingly textured, and complexly flavoured thanks to the condiments. 

Although we were very tempted to try the coleslaw too, the promise of dessert at our next stop was so great that we were able to put it off until next time when we will probably classy it up with a plate of meat and sides or go straight for the half pound of porchetta and head to a picnic."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. The first visit I went pretty late and got a sandwich, which was slightly dry. This time I got the plate, without the sandwich bun, the porchetta flavour came through nicely, and was juicy. Further, the crackling was very crunchy and delicious. Got the sauce with it, but it didn't need it. Place was pretty busy, but I got it with Ritual and pickup was fast. Restaurant was nice enough to let me sit and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"C'est le genre de place qui donne faim qui non seulement sert de quoi de magique, succulant et dÃ©licieux (il y a un nombre limitÃ© d'expressions pour qualifiÃ© la nourriture, on finit par se rÃ©pÃ©ter). Le tout Ã©tait un bon sandwich avec porchetta maison gÃ©nial, vraiment vieille Ã©cole et croquant de la peau du porcetta. Servit avec mozzarella et champignon avec sauce de porc vraiment bon.  Meilleur sandwich que j'ai mangÃ© depuis un trÃ¨s long moment! Il nous faut cet endroit Ã  MontrÃ©al. 

One of those, wait-a-minute-what-did-i-just-saw moment. To summarize it. Wow!! I wasn't that hungry but suddenly I was. Had a porchetta sandwich with mozzarella, the sauce or honnestly didn't really got it and mushrooms, Moutarde Ã  l'ancienne (Most likely some Moutarde de Meau). On the go, less than 10$, filled my invented hole in my stomach."}
{"text":"I got the house special sandwich and fries. Sandwich was really delicious with truffle sauce and grainy mustard. The combination with a really solid crunchy bun worked a treat. The fries were less good but overall the place is to be highly recommended."}
{"text":"Reviewing for King Branch. Dat bun! Omg! By far, the bestest of the buns I ever had for any sandwich or burger, sooo crispy and fresh. Went for the house special and you can't go wrong with it. Flavours are rushing, the meat is  soft and that Mustard adds the final punch. I found the sandwich a little bit salty. 

They have beer and various pops. It's a small venue with a handful of tables inside and a long bar like table on the front street looking to King. A good take out option, or if you have time, devour this heavenly sandwich slowly on a bar like setup outside."}
{"text":"So that was Porchetta...
How does one \"review\" eating greasy pig body parts in a bun? EASY like this. 
Have you ever wanted to feel like a pig for half an hour? well come to Porchetta and you will!
First you get in line (like a pig waiting to be slaughtered), As you shuffle forward inch by inch getting closer to the door you become overwhelmed by the sweet smell of sweaty savory swine, it's undeniable how good pork smells but it's also undeniable how good pork taste in your mouth. 

The staff was nice, I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with bacon. It was fantastic but I'm sure it would have tasted better if I could have oh I don't know SAT DOWN TO EAT IT! Because of the small, tight, closed in environment with the heat really ties everything together. All this place needed was an actual troff to feed it's customers and the \"feel like a pig\" experience would have been complete, oh the sparkling Orange juice sucked. 

Notes: 
-Place was clean
-Staff was nice
-Food was good with nice portion size
-Food was hot (temperature)
-Little to no seating sucks and really makes eating uncomfortable
-A little messy but fun 

I'd come back."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. I would recommend walking to this neighbourhood on a sunny day! I had the house special and weirdly it was almost a fusion or Italian and Asian (in a good way). Did not love the root beer sold there and it's a small place so if you plan on eating there, go on a sunny day on case you don't find a seat inside. But the sandwich is good and the guys are friendly :) will return!"}
{"text":"I got food delivered through Foodora so can't speak to service or general dining experience. 

Tried the OG Fried Chicken with fries and porchetta gravy. The chicken sandwich was excellent - great crispy skin doused in a sauce resembling buffalo sauce and another creamy dressing. Flavors were excellent but better eat it up quickly as there's a LOT of sauce so sandwich could get soggy (I recognize the delivery time was a factor in the sogginess). Bun was great and toasted. Thick cut fries are a substantial serving. Glad I added on the porchetta gravy with them. Beats ketchup and way better than regular gravy."}
{"text":"Had the original sandwich with hot sauce, washed down with a chinotto. The sandwich was delish, though I found that the crackle to meat ratio was ridiculously high. Don't get me wrong, I would normally trade any meat for crackle, but it was a bit like shards of meat sugar rather than skin. I ended up having to ask for more hot sauce to cut the oil from the sandwich, and by the time I finished my sandwich I was definitely glad the size of the roll was large enough to absorb the fat, although I was a little less full than I would have liked."}
{"text":"The Sandwich is really good, especially with rapini and parmesan! I asked for the crackling on the side so it was like a little snack on my way home with the sandwich. The price is a little too high for me, but totally worth it for a once in awhile treat. I'm so glad I finally tried this place. I think they use the same buns as Black Camel? I only found one small piece of fat which wasn't off putting to me (because it was melt in my mouth).

The space itself is super tiny so get it to go if you don't like small spaces :)"}
{"text":"I'm a weird guy. I don't like porchetta sandwich in any way, but I found my dining experience in Porchetta & Co. pretty pleasant.

Well, guess what... I had Korean spicy chicken sandwich. lol.

Anyways, the sandwich was outstanding and unforgettable. The chicken was perfectly fried - it was so crispy that it crisped my desire to come back for this sandwich again. The other beautiful thing about this sandwich was the citric mayo dressing. I just want to tell the designer of this sandwich that it was a brilliant call to add lemon in your mayo dressing. It made it so refreshing. Oddly, the contradicting flavours between the spicy hot chicken and the  citric mayo dressing made the sandwich surprisingly extraordinary. Good job.

One thing about this place is the price. A single sandwich for $10 is a bit pricey. I understand that they use really fresh ingredient, but I was hoping that I had a side dish included in my meal."}
{"text":"I've never had porchetta so I have nothing to compare this to, but as a sandwich it was hella tasty. It kinda reminded me of roasted pork that you get in Chinatown, but sandwiched in between Italian bread goodness. Add on some mustard and you have yourselves a damn tasty bun+meat combo."}
{"text":"Fast food prep and friendly service.

I probably go here every week.

The porchetta sandwich, I usually get with rapini and mustard and it's oh so good. Love the crispys. But, I agree with some other reviewers that it needs a bit more meat.

Also got to try the KFC (korean) and it was so spicy and tasty. But this one was a daily special so it would be pretty rare to see it. It was quite huge.

The fried chicken sandwich is also very good, it's huge and satisfying.

Overall, a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My -1 is only because this type of sandwich is supper unhealthy HAH, but so delicious. Really! Meaty and crunchy fat all in one. I got the house sandwich and it was yummy IF I EVER come here again I would get the three grill cheese one. But I'm not sure I could convince my healthy bf to come here again lol but it was very tasty guys!"}
{"text":"This location is very accessible and easy to find, right on King just before Portland. Went on a Saturday afternoon around 3 p.m., not busy at all and plenty of seats. Markedly bigger than their old location, still not great for big groups. 
Order at the counter, and they will call out your number when it's ready. Simple, no fuss, and great service.
We ordered the basic porchetta sandwich which came with mustard and hot sauce + the house special sandwich which is just the porchetta sandwich with truffle sauce, mozzarella, mustard, and hot sauce. And we also got a side of fries.
I find their sandwich pretty underwhelming this time, not sure if I should've added more sauce but I tried my boyfriend's house special sandwich and it wasn't noteworthy either. 
I noted they didn't put as much crackling, and the bun was a little dry. It's just missing that oomph that we were looking for.
Not long after our order came, the girl came out to tell us that they'd forgotten to add mushrooms as requested. She apologized and brought us a free plate of fries. I thought that was a nice touch, and she even accommodated our request to change the extra fries for mushrooms instead.
Overall, good but not great."}
{"text":"So I saw this on tastetoronto's Instagram and was a little disappointed...

The special of the day was Buttermilk fried chicken with caramelized onions and bacon grilled cheese. 

See photo below, there are hardly any caramelized onions and the bread is burnt. Overall the sandwich was okay, but probably not worth $10."}
{"text":"3.5 star. Its difficult to review a porchetta sandwhich after having a roli roti porchetta in san francisco. Its like driving a farrari then having to down grade to a K car. sure the k car is reliable and well made but you just don't get that farrari experience....

they do make a good porchetta here. actually it's the best i had in toronto so far. I like the crunchiness in the sandwich. the service is really good and you get your sandwich really quick."}
{"text":"Came here and tried their special - Chicken parm sandwich with truffle sauce and garlic bread buns, as well as tomato arancini balls sith smoked provolone. 
The arancini balls were really good, and the chunk of smoked provolone in the middle was gooey.
The sandwich was meh - I realize now that they're known for their porchetta, not the chicken. I found the bun a bit dry and hard, but it softened after absorbing some of the oils from the chicken and sauce. The sandwich was also on the salty side - not sure if its the chicken or the truffle sauce.

Will be back to try their porchetta sandwich and some deep fried mac n cheese balls."}
{"text":"We traveled last week from the States to visit a close friend who introduced us to this 'hole in the wall'. I was hooked with my very first bite. The best tasting bread incredibly fresh(toasty on the outside, spongy on the inside) and the best tasting pulled pork paired off with tasty mustard sauce. I loved it I went back for seconds and even wanted to take some to go the next day on our drive back to New Jersey, if only they opened early. Service is super friendly and quick. The lady at the counter is real nice. This is a must stop for a quick fill me up. I highly recommend you get there before lunch, it can get pretty busy. They open at 11:30am. For an extra buck or two you can add mushrooms, truffle sauce and a few other options they have available."}
{"text":"You know it's going to be good when you can smell the place a block away. 

It was a brisk Sunday morning when I met two fellow Yelpers for lunch. The windows were steamy and Porchetta was just gearing up for a busy lunch. The place is small but it is bursting at the seams with love for their craft. 

Coming here for the first time was a fantastic experience. The staff were really friendly and were more than helpful making suggestions on what I should try on my first of many more trips to come. I had the Porchetta sandwich with rapini and truffle sauce along with their soup of the day, a prochetta chowder. 

Both the chowder and sandwich were amazing. There were so many flavours mixed into the chowder and they were all so well blended. I'll warn you that even the small bowl of soup is quite filling. The sandwich just melted in my mouth. The soft, moist meat mixed with the odd crispy bite keeps you on your toes.

DO NOT SKIP THE TRUFFLE SAUCE! 
You might as well stay home if that's your plan.

If you haven't been here yet, drop everything your doing right now and go."}
{"text":"your all nuts or incredibly deprived. The sandwich is OK, the meat cutter weighing out and making sure she didnt go over 5 ounces of meat for my meat plate was obscene. there was a teeny bit of skin, meh. not worth going back unless im at dundas and bathurst and really want to eat. Now, the SOUP is bananas (i had the split pea), worth returning to during the winter for the soup. I tried the rapini, which was absolutely horrible, just horrible. 

Once again, if you want amazing pork go to HO HO BBQ in scarberia, that dude knows what the F**** is up.."}
{"text":"My first ever experience with Porchetta, and yummmmy!!

The pork that served here really remind me of Chinese Roasted Pork..but way more tender, tasty and moist!!

My sandwich has a mixture of lean meat, fat and skin (crunchy skin!!). The bun itself is really light, crusty and perfect pairing to the pork!! This sandwich is one I would say worth every single calories and fat content!!

The seating here is tight..but it feels really homey and warm. There are now 7 seatings...and not too many people eating in...

For $5.99, Porchetta sandwich.here is great as a snack, not as a meal itself. I will suggest to skip the adds on.. since the sandwich does taste good as it is..."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches. We had the house special porchetta sandwich which was delicious. The real winner was the original fried chicken sandwich which I'm still thinking about a few days later. Hot sauce on both was good.

The texture of both sandwiches was amazing. The buns managed to have a crispy outside while being soft on the inside. Same for the chicken, which was super crispy without drying out. Excellent lunch spot."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain went here. And now I have been there. The sandwich was delicious and cures my hangover and turnt the corners of my mouth upwards. The crackle, mayo, meat, and cheese were splendid. Will attend this space again. Cute snack bar near nice alley graffiti."}
{"text":"Sandwich: 5stars

They used so much wrapping for sit in, probably just get takeout next time."}
{"text":"The sandwich is delicious, really a treat but I was a little disappointed when I first saw the tiny package wrapped in front of me. Maybe a little bigger, yo? Don't get me wrong, would totally come back, but with adjusted expectations and appetite.

The small sandwich shop is located in the perfect area, west of Bathurst. Upon stepping inside, you get the whole picture, porcetta roasts lined up, check, bustling kitchen, check, cute girl on the till, check. Since it was my first time here, I asked for a recommendation and what do you know? They have it all laid out for you, you can order the house special sandwich which consists of porcetta and crackling, parm, hot sauce, truffle oil and mustard. Stupidly, I didn't just go for it, but instead opted for porcetta, parm and hot sauce. It was great, but it's always best to assume that a restaurant knows what its talking about.
Next time!
I would highly recommend and I plan on coming back here on my next trip to Toronto for that house special sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny space (it's better in the summer when there's outdoor seating) so it's best if you're taking your food to go. Assuming you can wait long enough to get home before you eat your sandwich.

My friends claim the other sandwiches (besides the traditional porchetta) are also delicious, but seriously, why would you get anything else? They are so good, there's no reason to stray."}
{"text":"They focus on one thing and they do it very well, and this is a resto intended for people who understand what porchetta is. If you're a walk-in who hasn't heard of them, you may be put off by the singular focus of this joint, but the chances are you'll become a convert when you taste the slow-roasted, succulent herbed pig. I'm a regular for their porchetta sandwich, or sometimes the porchetta plate with rapini, as the pleasing bitterness of the veg contracts wonderfully with the meat.

Sometimes they've been known to pre-slice the pork and fill your order by taking the pieces from an aluminum tray in the warmer. I prefer it when they cut the porchetta in front of me, with their electric carving knife, but I don't accuse them of leaving the pre-cut meat around for very long, so it doesn't dry out much. At least, that's been my experience.

After talking up the heavy focus on porchetta, I should add that their soups are fantastic - usually very heart and flavourful, best enjoyed on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"I should mention first that I've had the traditional porchetta sandwich at the original Dundas location menu times and it is, of course, magnificent. I'd never been to the new King Street location but a recent Instagram announcement of a Reuben special led me to finally make the trek.

First the good: That Reuben sandwich (Small Batch House Made Pastrami, Sauerkraut, Pickles, Mustard, Russian Dressing & Aged Cheddar) is just as good if not better than the original porchetta sammy. The pastrami is tender and flavorful, while the remainder of the toppings are both delicious and sparingly applied. I think this may have been the best Reuben sandwich I've ever had.

Now the bad: I also tried the Fried Chicken Sandwich (fried chicken, lettuce, pickles, hot sauce and creamy herb sauce). It's possible the fried chicken was delicious, but you'd never know from the amount of hot sauce that was slathered on this sandwich. I'll be honest and say that literally all I could taste in this thing was the massive amounts of vinegar coming from that aforementioned hot sauce. (It wasn't just me, either. I shared this sandwich and my dining companion had the same experience.)

I'm giving this meal four stars because of that Reuben, which was absolutely astounding. But that fried chicken sandwich... What a disaster."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than this. The OG Fried Chicken sandwich is by far the best fried chicken sandwich in Toronto. The house special procjetta sandwich is unbelievable too."}
{"text":"If you're in the Bathurst and Dundas area make sure you stop by this place! The sandwiches are amazing. My wife and I split the special of the day and we're both full! We had the Sweet & Spicy Korean Fried Chicken with Kimchi, Pickles, Green Onion Mayo, Lettuce and Cilantro. It was one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

I've gotten both the Porchetta sandwich and a Fried Chicken Club Special.  

I really don't know which one I enjoy more.  They are both delicious.  The crackling in the porchetta sandwich is a great burst of flavour.  The fried chicken club used chicken thigh which is the superior cut of chicken IMO. 

I dropped one star because the sides offered aren't very exciting, but the sandwiches are definitely 5 Star all the way."}
{"text":"I noticed some friends blowing up Porchetta on my facebook feed so I decided to give it a try. I got the House Special. It's a very good sandwich. The sauces complimented the meat very nicely. There was the whole grain mustard and truffle sauce mix very nicely together and add a nice depth of flavor. The crackling which is like a salty pork rind gave the sandwich an interesting texture. The only problem was that I found the porchetta itself, albeit seasoned nicely and flavourful, to be a bit dry. Edible, but not pleasantly so. I was wishing that the main star of the dish would have been greater than all the other parts but it was the best done part of the sandwich and sadly it was not. Other than that, it was a pretty good sandwich."}
{"text":"I've yet to try the chicken, but the Porchetta here is very good, and they had a small but decent selection of beer. $5 Steam Whistle goes great with a porchetta plate for lunch. The only qualm I have is that the poutine really isn't worth the extra $3 - there aren't that many fries, and there isn't a lot of cheese or gravy either. The biggest thing here is that both the cashiers I've encountered have been super nice - a contrast to the Dundas location where the staff were too busy discussing what they were going to do that weekend to attend to the only customer standing in front of the cash register."}
{"text":"Awesome came all the way from Cleveland Ohio to try it out and loved it. Might go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"What to try?

Their porchetta sandwich. Served in this different kind of bun that's toasted very nicely to the point that when you bite into it gives you the crunch you will be excited about. With a spread of Dijon and spicy sauce, adds the right amount of taste to the porchetta. I also ordered the specialty cider tempt 9 for the very first time and I thought wow, this drink is really good! Great for the summer and girls will absolutely love it if they're into sweet cidars. Try it out!

Last tip?

I didn't get to try everything on the menu but I would definitely give their house made cookies a try next time and the other sandwiches. Everything was made to order and you can even get a glimpse as they make it if you peer through the small window into their kitchen. I believe you can order the full porchetta if you wanted too."}
{"text":"The sandwich was fine, get the special with the truffle. The plain one is wayyy too dry. And the bread to meat ratio was off - not enough meat.

My biggest gripe was the service. We stopped in right when we got to Toronto. The cashier was not helpful and very unwelcoming. We were deciding what sandwiches to get and she was being difficult and giving us attitude for no reason. And when I went to pay, she informed me that it was cash only. I didn't have any cash, so I asked if she had an ATM, and she responded by asking me, \"Do I own an ATM?\" Uhhhh, wtf? Obviously, I was asking if there was an ATM on the premises. So unhelpful and either full of attitude or just plain dumb, not sure which is worse."}
{"text":"Great sandwich spot, I would suggest original pork sandwich. Chicken sandwich is good as well, but lately it's too strong, sauce is strong and batter for fried chicken is too salty."}
{"text":"I've read so, so many great reviews on Porchetta & Co that I can't believe how badly it failed to meet my expectations. I really, really thought that I'd love it! I love sandwiches and I love roasted pork, so I thought that the combination must be a winner! In the words of my friends, \"It was a complete waste of a Saturday lunch\", and I couldn't agree more.  

My friend opted for a classic porchetta sandwich without any additions. After one bite, she commented that it tasted exactly like Chinese roasted pork, or siu yuk (). 

I added mushrooms to my sandwich for 75 cents, thinking that they would add moisture to the pork. However, after taking my first bite, I couldn't help but agree with my friend- it tasted exactly like Chinese roasted pork, except less fatty (which is not a good thing in my books). Despite the mushrooms, I couldn't get past how dry the overall sandwich was! Where was the juiciness that I read from all the online reviews!?!? Maybe I should've added some sort of sauce instead of mushrooms. 

In an attempt to make it \"less\" Chinese, I added some grainy mustard and Tabasco sauce onto my sandwich. Unfortunately, that didn't really help much. The meat was still really dry...

So after being all hyped up over this porchetta sandwich, my friend and I were utterly disappointed. We really wished that we had had lunch at the food court instead. Subway would've tasted better than this!"}
{"text":"Flew in from NJ w/ my friend for the Jays game came in ordered the The House Special it was out of this world. My friend was loved it so much he ordered another one w/ Poutine. Whenever I'm back in Toronto this is my 1st stop."}
{"text":"Love this location.  A pig icon welcomes you into this urban eatery.  With their wood decor,  pig porchetta display, and awesome smell how could one pass up this place.  

The house special sandwhich with parmesan, truffle, and house sauce for  $8.95 was so freaking good.  One bite and your hooked.  Even though I had about 3 meals prior to this I still wanted to finish this divine sandwhich.  Love the truffle flavor, hot sauce on the table, and the mustard green .... was omg heavenly.  

Love it ! Probably my favorite place to eat and I was planning my trio to come back even before I finished the sandwich.  

No free WiFi but next door is Starbucks"}
{"text":"I'm a longtime fan and have been since they were at just one location and cash-only. I hadn't been for a while and recently discovered their King location which, to my delight, was not only more convenient for me but also accepts credit cards!

I ordered the house special, which was just as delicious as I remembered. The crisp bun shattered under gentle pressure from my teeth in the most delightful way and the inside was really fluffy.

The porchetta was delicious, though I kind of felt like it was less meat than I was used to having. The truffle sauce was just diviiine! Ditto the parmesan. 

I personally love grainy mustard but in this sandwich is almost threatens to overwhelm the precious truffle flavour. And I felt the hot sauce was definitely overbearing - too acidic! It almost cancels out the truffle.

So next time, I'll get the sandwich with just truffle sauce and parm, which is the same price as the house special but will be better tasting, I think.

I also ordered the rapini. It was alright. A bit too acidic and I wish it were more garlicky. I do like the slight bitterness of that veggie though!

*AH-NOLD voice* I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I get it. Now you go get it get it. Porchetta & Co is pork satisfaction personified.

In this quickly developing Bathurst and Dundas haven, this is where you should get your sandwich. Don't overthink it, just give in to the oink-y goodness. Their house sandwich is excellent and the truffle really makes it pop. If you're feeling healthy have them add rapini. 

The crackle. Oh the crackle! There is a reason why crack is in crackle. Get it get it."}
{"text":"Delicious shredded pork in a soft bun. The skin is crispy and tastes authentically Italian. The mustard and hot sauce on the side is a must. We've been coming here for the last few years and have never been let down of the juicy succulent pork. 1 thing that sets this place a part is the quality of buns - so soft, so squishy it's like you're barely eating bread. Worth the price, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Small store with a few seats by the window. Incredibly cute logo but inside the store was dim and dingy. The staff wasn't too friendly or engaged, they were busy cleaning up and washing trays at 7pm.

To put it simply, tastes like Chinese food. The pork plus the crackling basically tastes like the crispy pork from a Chinese BBQ place. Read on Yelp that the rapini was a must try and it turned out to be a bitter green. The plate was just disappointing, not something to be had again. The deep fried mac and cheese ball was crispy on the outside but the inside felt weird. The cheese was grainy and not smooth, kind of felt like processed powder cheese.

Overall, definitely not worth coming back. Also, not along the subway line so wouldn't take the trip."}
{"text":"being the original location to bring porchetta to toronto im sure wasn't easy. this location is super super tiny, but packs a serious flavorful punch. this location has a pretty awkward schedule, being that they are off Sunday, and Monday, and only open until 9. being so close to the hard luck bar, i kinda figured they would have extended hours when concerts are in session, as the only alternative in the area is a mcds/tim hortons(hoo-ray...not!) the staff are super friendly, and work hard to get this little joyful packages of food out in quick fashion. the sandwiches come with or without \"cracklin\" which is a really really weird option, in my opinion, i would recommend the sandwich without it. the restaurant has alot of topping options for the pork sandwiches, ranging from something as simple as in house made mustard(realllllllllly good) all the way up to truffle sauce(not sure if its good or not) parking is available on the street if you can find it. i am a fan of this business, and what they bring to toronto in flavor, just not happy with this locations hours, so i don't always get to come to this location. 
somewhat transit friendly, i find myself walking down from Bathurst, which is less then five minutes. 
if you're in the neighborhood, give it a shot, its worth it!"}
{"text":"came here for valentines day dinner. 
this location is so new, the main website for the company doesn't list it, and the telephone number on yelp for this location, is for the Dundas st location. 
this location is in the basement of a commercial building, and is very nicely fit into, what looks like the buildings mechanical room, this establishment is super clean(being brand new helps) and has seating for about 20 people. this location specifically has more menu options then the Dundas location, the service is top notch, definitely utilizing the space that they have to work with to crank out the great quality of food, that this company is known for. this location also has a couple of beer options, with the cheapest being steam whistle(5 bucks for a normal can) the flavor of the food, this location knocks it out of the park, the sandwiches are hearty without any toppings, and available as an extra meat option. as well was able to get the poutine, which in this restaurants fashion, came with little pieces of cracklin. this location also has a t.v. to catch up on recent events, but you won't be looking at it because of how delicious the food is, mouth-watering and very euphoric. the service is great, again with the combination of the prompt service, coupled with an excellent cashier makes for a solid team which will serve this location well. 
super transit friendly, with excellent hours, and open everyday of the week(not like Dundas). parking is on the street if you can find it, with some private lots in the area. as well i was privy to experience that UBER was in and out of this location picking up food for delivery(didn't know that was an option) 
we took a gamble last night on this location being open, and it was an excellent dinner to compliment valentines day.
my only negative comments are as follows: the bathroom is super small I.E. not fluffy friendly, the cashier should ask if you want cracklin or not, the fries were salted with sea salt(not a problem for me, but some people may hate it) and last but certainly not least, no dessert options. would be very interested to see what they would do for a dessert option(do it!) 
defiantly worth going out of you're way to try it!"}
{"text":"Porchetta and Co is delicious and fast. It's a bit of an outsider of it's area of fancy restaurants, but provides the option for a cheaper and less jajaju eating environment. The menu is quite small, but if you're coming to a place like this, there's no point in ordering anything but the classic sandwich. It is sheer perfection and includes some truffle flavour!! 

Ok I'll admit, the other sandwich (fried chicken) is good too. My friend ordered that because she's weird, but I'd still say go for what they're known for!!!

Fries are good too, huge portion."}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches so much they are very tasty, but i wont give it a 5 start rating  just because of the price point,super pricey in my opinion if you go there for dinner you need at least two sandwiches to feed yourself  properly, but if you have a small stomach go for it, you will love it !!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, but it works trust me.

Porchetta sandwich?- Best in class, get it with all the toppings.  Tasty, not too greasy.

Fried Chicken Big Mac?- Be prepared to have mind blown.  I'm already thinking about going back and eating another of these things.

{"text":"A really good sandwich, I ordered the house special, and the issue I found was the hot sauce was only on one side, and that's why it's missing a star. Very tasty sandwich, it's also a bit messy. I will be going back, it's a great alternative to a hamburger."}
{"text":"So I was actually on my way to The Hoof Cafe with Danny W. when I literally arm-barred him. Reason? I saw the sign for Porchetta & Co. on the window and HAD to try it after hearing so many great things about it :) 

We ordered one porchetta sandwich to share since we still fully intended to go to Hoof Cafe.  So for those who don't know, the basic sandwich is literally meat piled on a sourdough bun.  The bun comes from across the street, Caldense Bakery.  The meat inside was super moist.. there were some fatty bits which don't appeal to me, but I can totally see that it's necessary to get the meat so juicy.  I love the crunchy bits of skin. That was always my favorite part when eating roasted pork chinese-style.  We had shrooms and the grainy mustard to go with it. Came out to 8 bucks.  I would definitely consider stopping by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  If you want a super-quick sandwich to go and love pork, this is for you!"}
